I shave and my skin look normal and lighter and radiant during the shave but when Iv finished my skin looks really browned is this normal? And it looks very dull and my face also goes puffy/rounder idk why. I‚Äôm not talking the shave area I‚Äôm talking the whole face. Sometimes It feels tight on my cheeks and smarting too sometimes and my lip on one side swellls up too
This happened everytime. During the shave my skin is moist and I look fine but after as I said it looks very dull and bloated looking. I don‚Äôt use aftershave will that help?
I use shave gel and new Gillette Mach3 or fusion blades every time. I take my time with it also

Edit: or is this hyperpigmentation?

2,"We're both university/college students in our first year (He's 20 though and starting a new program) and as many of you guys are experiencing, right now is midterm season. We haven't really been able to see much of each other because of this. Things have been stressful and even texting has been taken down a few notches due to due dates. Last night my boyfriend stood outside in the cold in a lineup for 6 hours to get his full license while running on 3 hours of sleep, and yet he stopped by my place on the way back to his to say hi!!! I've never been surprised like this before (my ex hated surprises and never did any to me despite me pleading him numerous times) and the fact that he wanted to say hi to me for 5 minutes instead of going straight away to his house just makes me so happy :) 

I smelled like sweat as I was at home, tired and didn't give a shit. I also didn't think he'd drop by (he said he might but I never really heard back from him as his phone died and I assumed he'd just go home) and didn't really look too good but he said he didn't care and that I looked good. What did I do to deserve him :')

4,"I Know this is political but this is a thought I had and I don't know where else I can share it.

My politics, I'm a progressive democrat voter but I also love following politics. And Mitch even though I do not like him is brilliant at what he does.

So here is the situation. Mitch is smart, he knows that the Republicans are very likely going lose the senate, and Trump is goig lose, and the Democrats are likely to have majorities in every part of the Goverment. Also Mitch understands that the demographic change in America is bad for the Republican party. Mitch understands that to move his conservative agenda forward and protect it the best way is through the courts. 

Mitch also doesn't like Trump, he thinks that Trump is bad for the Republican party, that he turns off the moderate part of the party and inspires the left to rise up and vote. 

Mitch also wants to give Biden the worst possible start to his presidency that he can. Look American voters have short memories. In 6 months 80% of Americans won't remember what Mitch did, plus Mitch is in Kentucky, and Mitch seat is safe so long as he wants it.

So America is hurting, tens of millions have lost their jobs, nearly 10 million COVID19 cases, nearly 250,000 dead, 1/3 of Americans are facing losing the roof over there head. Things are very, very bad. Democrats have passed numerous stimilus spending in the house and the senate just needed to vote on them. 

Mitch wasn't allowing it. Then RBG passed away on the 18th of September. Mitch knew this was his last chance to get another supreme court pick. He pushed that throw, and as soon as he was succesful he sent the senate home with no stimilus spending.

In the process Mitch accomplished everything he wanted

* He gave Biden the biggest shit sandwich he possibly could
* He created a super conservative majority on the court
* He sealed Trumps fate

So what is Mitch plan after the election?

Trump is going lose, once Biden comes into power the democrats will pass stimilus spending. The GOP will attack Biden on this, say he's runnign up the debt. Also chances are Biden will have to do several unpopular decisions to control COVID19. Mitch will attack Biden on this. Trump will be gone. 

Why did this screw Trump?

The one thing that I think could have changed Trumps fate is stimlus spending. Had Trump been able to get checks out to the American people and pass relief he could go campaign and said ""Look folks times are hard, but I got your back, I saved your homes, I put food on your table, vote for me and I will be the president that keeps on protecting you, the normal American and I will keep on fighting deep state!""

But he can't say that.

What should have Trump done? Or better yet what would I have done if I was Trump on September 18th when RBG passed.

I'd have called Mitch to my office, I would have sat down with Mitch and say ""Mitch I'm going be making a speech here soon. I'm going tell the American people I will not nominate a new supreme court justice until the senate passes stimiulus spending and here is what I want

* $1,500 for every American
* Letters going out to every American household saying I signed that bill into law
* Funding for state unemployment funds
* Funding for COVID19 relief
* Funding for small businesses
* Save the airlines

The fast you pass a bill that gives me that the fast I nominate a justice of your choosing. And in my speech I'm going say that I'm doing this because we need to put the American people first, before everything else""

Mitch hands would be tied, without Trump support no nominee, no one to confirm, no supreme court pick, Trump gets to paint himself as the leader who rises above party politics.

But Trump didn't do that cause he's an idiot.

And this is how Mitch fucked over Trump and Biden and got everything he wanted in the process.",31Oct2020,1

6,"
Starting off, I‚Äôm a 19 year old female dating a 30 year old male. What I‚Äôve by far endured by now is just breaking me to the point where I just can‚Äôt even deal with this anymore. He is in a professional career, comes from a very very wealthy family and has been dating me for 4 months now. No I‚Äôm not with him for money-the only thing he has ever bought me was McDonald‚Äôs food and a ring for my birthday. He was in a relationship for two years with his ex who was manipulative, controlling and apparently would check his phone every waking moment of his day. He was going to get married to her when she cheated on him with her ex boyfriend while they were on a break. I met him through a dating app and we seemingly hit it off. He was honest with me at the start about everything then later by the second time we met he started pressuring me to do sexual things with him in order to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù. I was 18 at that time. He knew I was a virgin-had no experience whatsoever but he started to push my boundaries which he himself admitted to because ‚Äúit will feel better now then later with age‚Äù. My naivety got the best of me and he coaxed me into losing my virginity to him. Keep in mind I wanted to wait till marriage. He took that from me as well. And to him it wasn‚Äôt a big deal as it was for me. I just wanted a innocent relationship with him where he‚Äôd take me out to dates and we would hangout. He would always complain about how busy he was so I started to bring my guard down and gave into whatever he wanted. He may think I‚Äôm ‚Äúeasy‚Äù but the stuff he‚Äôs done to me is just too much. Flash forward two days ago when I met up with him, he told me how if his ex found out she would ‚Äútrick‚Äù him into having him add her on snap because they had raised a puppy together which he later gave to her when they broke up. And that she would try to ‚Äúlure him‚Äù back in by sending nudes-keep in mind she‚Äôs a 29 year old teacher who would basically do anything to pull him back. And she would harass me if she knew that I was his girlfriend.And he would ‚Äúprobably not respond to her nudes‚Äù according to his own words. When he told me all this I stayed quiet and nodded that I understood the situation but in reality it makes me wonder if all this happened already during the time we‚Äôve been together. I haven‚Äôt met his parents which he insists he keeps his life private from them because they would nag him to get married and that they think I would leave him-which I wouldn‚Äôt because I love him so much. But I don‚Äôt think he will introduce me until we‚Äôve been together for a year. He‚Äôs trying to tell me to wait to tell my own parents until there is ‚Äòstability‚Äù in our relationship. He also says that he doesn‚Äôt have any social media other then snap because his ex made him delete it all back when they were together. Which is also suspicious as he claims to not have any social media. I haven‚Äôt ever checked his phone because I trust him while his ex always did but with what I‚Äôm seeing now I can‚Äôt help but have a gut feeling that he‚Äôs still talking to her. I don‚Äôt want to check his phone because I feel like it‚Äôs wrong but I don‚Äôt have any choice at this point either. I can‚Äôt be in love with someone who is still in love with their ex. Keep in mind they broke up a year before he started dating me. Also initially in our relationship he lied to me about his name and career-because he thought I wouldn‚Äôt want him because the career I‚Äôm planning to go into (medschool) he isn‚Äôt in-(he initially told me he‚Äôs a doctor but he‚Äôs not rather a vet) but I still forgave him and took him back. He also says how he wants to get a court marriage with me once I start MD school in 3 years. What would anyone attain from a court marriage? What should I do? Could he possibly have a wife or an SO he‚Äôs hiding?

Today, I got approval from my manager to work from home at my parents‚Äô place during the holidays. Once I found out, I called my dad while he was at work to tell him the good news. Needless to say, he was very happy to hear this. He was telling me about how he‚Äôs had a rough week, but learning about my plans made his day. And then he said that my mom is going to be so happy once she finds out. 

He had to hang up shortly after, since he was busy at the office. After we got off the phone, I started to tear up. I realized how lucky I am to have the parents that I have. They have sacrificed so much for me and allowed me to become the person that I am today. It made me so happy to hear how thrilled my dad was about me coming home.

People close to her aren't taking the virus seriously despite having family members who've gotten sick (They've recovered, but it's still unnerving). She seemed so defeated when I was talking to her, and she seems to be disappointed by the fact that humanity seemingly failed to come together at a time when they needed to most. She said that she's still going to wear a mask and sanitize her hands, but she seems to have accepted the fact that she'll never be 100% safe from COVID-19, so there's no real point in adhering to prevention guidelines when no one else is. I felt so helpless listening to her. I've felt just as hopeless and disillusioned about the pandemic, and I still do. I just wish that I knew how to help.

I am being vague on purpose, as I don't know if he will find this.

For a while now, my brother has had a huge attitude. We are in our mid to late teens. He has called me names that shouldn't be repeated ever again, but the names he called me really hurt my feelings. He has been yelling at me over stupid things, and every time he yells, it makes me really anxious. There have been many, horrible incidents with him yelling at me and trying to get back at me for something that I said like months before. Today, he yelled at me for having an ""attitude"" from me questioning something he said.

Essentially, he yells at me frequently, and I don't like it, as it makes me have panic attacks. 

I am scared to tell my parents because, with my brother, everything ties back to me in some way. If my dad yells at him for things he says to me, I am scared that my brother will go directly to me after that and yell at me, and I don't want that to happen and my brother would probably do that. I don't like it when people yell, at all. He has threatened me in the past for something that I said to his friends in a joking manner.

When he starts arguments with me, he will always blame me for arguing and blaming me for everything.

The thing is, after he stops yelling at me, he acts like things are back to normal. He doesn't act this way around my parents, possibly because he is afraid of the punishments if he did.

With anything I say, I am scared that I will get yelled at by him. I guess I am looking for help in this situation to make it stop because I can't take it anymore.",31Oct2020,1
24,"My post history explains more into detail but basically my life is currently a dumpster fire. I need money to turn my water on, grocery money, ect. So I made the difficult decision to pawn my great grandmother's ring that she gave me when I was 17 years old before she passed away. We had a very special relationship and I was blessed to take care of her for the last three months of her life. 

Every Christmas she would give us heirlooms from her life that she thought we would enjoy. The last two heirlooms she gave to me was her wedding ring and her gold vanity she had for over 40 years.

 I know it's silly but every female in the family had long thin fingers and I had stubby sausage fingers. When she gave it to me I put it on and it slid on like it was made for me, it was magical. The ring was put into our family lock box that held valuables, birth certificates, ect at my dads house. Fast forward to now. 

I needed to renew my license and I needed to get my birth certificate. I also planned on getting the ring so I could pawn it and get a loan on it and would buy it back. I also decided to grab my homecoming/prom dresses so my girls could wear them as a costume tmrw since I have no money for costumes. This was also an excuse to talk to my dad after years of him ghosting me. 

I was scared to death to go over there, to the house I grew up in that once was my comfort. I debated about bringing my babies with me but decided against it as I didn't want to make anyone uncomfortable. I pull up and knock on the door and am let inside by my dad. I was shaky and emotional, but hopeful. 

After about ten minutes I realized this isn't how I expected things to go down and the conversation was going south so I asked for my dresses, the vanity, my birth certificate, and the ring. I had a feeling I'd never be coming back to this house again. My dad's wife starts laughing at me.

 Confused and uncomfortable, I ask again for MY things. She tells me that my things are long gone. Again, confused, I say I don‚Äôt understand?? Surely she isn't insinuating that they got rid of my birth certificate, the ring given to ME, and all of my dresses without so much of a text message at the time saying to come get those things!!??

I‚Äôm a 31 year old woman, who‚Äôs faced my share of adversity. I‚Äôm not naive to the realities of suffering in the world, I am well aware of how ubiquitous it is, and recognize I am not immune. 

That being said, I am at an impasse in my life where the idea of finding a legal means to end my life has taken over my train of thought for the past couple of years. I‚Äôm so tired of feeling a chronic state of despair. 

I ask for the suspension of judgement. 
I come from a large family (10) and am a middle child-
I identify as Arab-American, and have faced a horrifying experience at the hands of Federal law enforcement when I was 14 (myself and my family) that included breaking into our home and brandishing guns against my siblings and I, all of which were minors and one vulnerable adult brother with schizophrenia. My parents aren‚Äôt educated, as they lived under a military occupation in their country of origin, and my siblings and I were all born here in the US. 

I carried a phobia of law enforcement and a feeling of alienation as an American citizen for over a decade
Since that incident and tried my hand in therapy for it. I was referred to a psychiatrist who shared my cultural background for greater ‚Äòcompatibility‚Äô and she ended up being an unethical practitioner who exploited me by Soliciting private sessions with my family outside the clinic I went to see her in, in exchange for funds. Illegal, which I didn‚Äôt know, and I later found out she was being investigated by the clinic when she ended up working with my family one-on-one and prescribing a slew of medications to treat them. The prime reason I saw her was to address my phobia of law enforcement trauma and witnessing the degeneration of my eldest brother from schizophrenia since I was 13. She convinced me she could ‚Äòhelp‚Äô us, used our finances, and over medicated my siblings, violated hipaa by discussing the privacy of others in our community, and even between my family and our private sessions. 

My sister was given a cocktail of medication that elicited a psychotic break (we found out later that she was not supposed to be given the combination she had and her PCP didn‚Äôt understand how the pharmacy missed this red flag- my sister had picked it up from different pharmacies not knowing the contraindications). 

All this time, this psychiatrist intimidated me and my family, and used us long enough to give her the funds she needed to lease her own clinic (my brother was a business owner and supplied the funds- we had no idea we were being conned). 

The psychiatrist absolved herself of responsibility of my sister‚Äôs psychosis, and my brother with schizophrenia had a massive psychotic break (when he was stable at that point, but she wanted to try him on new medication to ‚Äòheal‚Äô him). When I called the psychiatrist to tell her what was happening, she blamed my mother for giving my brother the medication the psychiatrist  *specifically* prescribed, and instructed my uneducated mother to give him and said, ‚ÄúYour mother is irresponsible and not educated, I am not responsible- she shouldn‚Äôt have given it to him. Take him to the hospital, I have nothing to do with it.‚Äù 

I was in shock, despair, and went to the clinic to confront them and the clinic directors were visibly shaking. I found out they themselves were having legal troubles with her; they told me they genuinely didn‚Äôt know she did this to me and legally weren‚Äôt allowed to tell patients why the clincian was being let go from their clinic. They gave me the medical board of practice information, I tried contacting them, but the amount of evidence I needed to submit I didn‚Äôt have available other than my testimony and something called a ‚Äúretainers agreement ‚Äú I signed, and the medication we were all prescribed. My siblings were too psychotic for me to compartmentalize. 

Seeing the state of brokenness it left my family, I couldn‚Äôt summon the energy to pursue anything the route of the medical board. I was absolutely traumatized. I tried to reinstate my brother back into a hospital, and they kept rotating him through student doctors, and he kept regressing while still unstable, until I found one after two years. My sister however, spent her twenties (she is two years older than me) vacillating in a series of psychotic breaks that were exacerbated from MVA‚Äôs, and TBI‚Äôs that resulted in compounded her already fragile mental state. 


I wanted to die. I was suicidal for years and had to fight to reclaim my will to live. 

Prior to all this, we lost our home when I was 13, lost my father to incarceration for underreported sales tax (his lawyer defended against the accusations of him sending remittances to terrorist organizations when he sent money to his family overseas, and the judge ruled in my fathers favor and exclaimed there was absolutely no evidence and that the motive was prejudicial), though he still spent a year incarcerated for under reporting taxes, and then took care of my brother who had series of psychotic breaks. 


I found an emergency mental health clinic after my experience with this psychiatrist when I was 23, to treat me for my suicidal ideation because I lost my will to live and couldn‚Äôt control the absolute despair within me and uncontrollable crying. I was afraid to leave my room for a month, and was afraid of being awake, and afraid to sleep because of nightmares. It hurt to live. It was horrifying. 

After a decade, my brother and sister are relatively ‚Äòstable‚Äô, and in that emergency mental health clinic I attended, the therapist stabilized me somewhat and addressed why I didn‚Äôt reach out to law enforcement. Because of my earlier adverse experience with federal agents, which the original psychiatrist I saw knew of and recognized I had a massive fear of anything criminal justice related. Hence, why she exploited me, knowing I was traumatized and blocked them out as an method of coping safely. 

Throughout all this, since I was 16 and old enough to work and drive, I coped by working out religiously for at least 5 days a week, and pursued a degree in psychology to better educate my family about my brother‚Äôs illness, since my parents had a middle school level of educational attainment and didn‚Äôt understand what was happening. When my sister had her psychotic break around my senior year of college, in which she accused me of conspiring to kill her, I was left traumatized and couldn‚Äôt finish my last semester because I couldn‚Äôt believe another sibling was falling prey to the cruelty of a mental illness so severe. 

Three other brothers had car accidents that crippled one for the first three years after his accident (January 11, 2011). 

My sister with the psychosis, had a MVA (January 23, 2016) that broke the entire right side of her body‚Äôs bones, and left her with a subarachnoid hemorrhage and subdural hematoma, making her even more delusional. She was in a coma for 3 weeks, and in ICU for another 3, of which I dropped everything and stayed with her in the hospital acting as her advocate to work with her care team. 

My father is terminal with cancer currently, and has been battling it during my 20‚Äôs, concurrently with my sisters battle with psychosis. We are approaching the last couple months of his life. 

Throughout this experience, I had a close friend for six years in my 20‚Äôs who I discovered was a vulnerable narcissist, and was socially comparing her life to mine as a means to make her feel better about herself (she has a masters in English education). When she couldn‚Äôt use me as supply (I‚Äôd ask for space to ground myself and try to cope with the pain of my family‚Äôs illnesses), she would victimize herself and start to passively aggressively emotionally abuse me and use my empathy against me. 

Two of her sisters exposed her and called her out because they respected and loved me, and found out what she was doing. I couldn‚Äôt understand the level of evil someone could descend to do that, knowing what she knew about how I was exploited and what I had gone through (she hadn‚Äôt gone through serious adversity but was a fragile personality- though, I found later her sisters told me she was jealous of my resilience because she was more sensitive to crumbling under pressure- this enraged her). I mean, just how callous-? 

I am so tired. I just wanted to be a good person in the world and pursue my love for higher education. I‚Äôm mentally not the same, I feel like there is an impairment in my focus and memory specifically- and it grieves me to lose (in some sense), the most prized thing to me- my mental health &amp;amp; agility. 

Forgive me everyone, I just needed to unload this somewhere. If you‚Äôve read this all, thank you for taking time from your lives- I genuinely hope that others aren‚Äôt subject to my experiences, and pray you are all thriving.",31Oct2020,1
28,"Pretty sure a few racoons or foxes just killed a bunny and got excited, till they heard whatever the fuck that tall bright one eyed monstrosity on the deck is, that keeps making death noises in the distance. Its like an injured bunny five times our size with one eye. What the fuck is that thing racoon bros, idk bro.

Woof, thats right, Zombie doggo demans are wiser then primitive animals, things that sound like their dying but are defying the way predators eyes work like morning with a one eyed flashlight looking in their direction stomping and growling, silent stare and repeat, its way taller then us bro they squeak.

Making death gibberish screams is probably the scariest thing the predators keep looking at after running further away. Especially when any noise they make makes it growl, look at them and maybe lightly come closer. Cause nothing they've ever met, does something like them and their food combined.

I think the bunny either got away cause I heard it scream again later too, or it waited around cause its dumb and didn't know what the fuck I was either and did similar noises when it heard the predators so I think the hunt is over cause they all fucked off. So bunny naighboor might be safe and I'm almost done my smoke, which is smoking my one eye up. 

So I guess the racoons or foxes might have nightmares tomorow day, cause that all noise making whatever the fuck didn't sound healthy, friendly or natural. Raccoon/fox bros, I think that thing was some kind of supernatural being of eldritch monster powers beyond our feeble lives. I hope I never run into one I can see better, cause it sounded fucked up, and like it was chocking.

Mwahahawoof, doggo deman be scary night monster and it not even halloween when he become werewoof, cause all hallows eve is a full moon this year and thats my favorite season to be jolly.

Woof, have a good night humans, try imagining what tje foxes or racoons thought I was in the dark light. Like an eclipse to the animal that looks up and is blinded by what it doesn't comprehend.

Even beyond the riots that will likely take place after the election (regardless of who wins), the Trump supporters, especially the Q-Anon believers, will be holding on to their narratives even tighter. They will be even angrier, even more afraid, and probably even more convinced that this is all some kind of deep state liberal manipulation and that they need to take drastic action to defend their 'freedoms'.

41,"2 years ago, ocd was telling me to return home in order to get paper napkins. I did not want to do the compulsion but ocd kept insisting. I tried to make a promise to God about not returning home in order to get paper napkins because I wanted to use the fear of the promise to force myself not to do the compulsion. I was dizzy from anxiety. I did not want to make the promise. It was the only way to say no to my ocd. I visualised the promise in order not to make any mistake while making it. I canceled the promise in the last second. I am not sure if it counted or not.

1 year ago, I was living in a different apartment. I spilled some milk in the common corridor/staircase of the building, while I was taking out the trash. I returned in my apartment without noticing the spilled milk. The lady next door noticed it, and threw paper on the floor, as if she was telling me ""clean them!"" I remember taking 1 or 2 dish sponges and a bag and going out to the corridor to clean it. I think, I cleaned the stains and also, cleaned some other dirt from the stairs OUT of the building. I think, I threw the sponges on the street dustbin and returned home while the paper of the lady, was left on the floor. I think, the lady noticed that I cleaned it, so she threw the papers away.

I am not sure if this is what really happened. I cant remember. My mind made an hypothesis. What if after cleaning the stairs outside, I returned to the building to take the lady's paper in order to throw everything in the dustbin with my sponges? Does that break the promise about not returning home in order to get paper napkins?

Someone makes a promise to God about not returning home in order to get paper napkins and he visualises the promise in order not to make any mistakes. He was living in a different apartment when he made the promise.

That guy was cleaning some stairs outside of the building of his newer aparment and returned inside the common corridor/staircse in order to get some kitchen paper or paper napkins that were thrown on by the lady next door, in order to throw them into a dustbin.

Did he broke the promise?

I worry because a punishment was asked in case breaking that promise.",31Oct2020,1
42,"My wife has a friend, Susan, who throws a big Halloween bash every year. She spends months beforehand decorating and preparing food and drinks and turning her entire, large, home into a haunted house. Susan is married to an auto executive with a big company, so she has the time and money to spend on decorations. Halloween is her favorite holiday and she goes all-out. It is really a sight to see. It is always a costume party, everyone is expected to dress up for the occasion, and a prize is given to the best costume of the night.  

This all happened around the time that the *Lord of the Rings* movies came out. A new one came out every year, they won a bunch of awards, and took over the world for a while. My wife and I had seen the films, and--like everyone else--we were big fans. With Susan's famous Halloween party looming on the horizon, my wife and I decided to dress up as Aragorn and Arwen and really, *really* do the costumes right. We were inspired by the numerous examples of cosplay we had seen online of various characters, and admired the amount of work and attention to detail, so, just this once, we decided to take a few weeks and put our best efforts into our costumes. My wife, especially, has a competitive streak, and when she puts her mind to something, there's no stopping her. Our costumes would rule the day.

My wife decided to recreate Arwen's white outfit she wears in her first appearance in the movies, and I went with Aragorn's travel-stained outfit from the first film. We printed out many pictures of the outfits and paid attention to every detail--and those costumes have a lot of detail! Arwen's outfit is pretty basic, but it has a lot of detail in the stitching, and the sleeves took a lot of work to recreate. She spent many hours hand-stitching and swearing over her sewing machine. Aragorn's outfit was also no easy task. His outfit has many places where it has been patched and stitched and worn threadbare, it has mud and stains on it, many layers of cloth and leather, and many accessories. (Did you know that the scabbard of Aragorn's sword has another small scabbard attached which holds an eating knife? It's never used in the movie, but it's there.)  

We spent days going to costume stores and used-clothing stores and flea markets, picking up items here and there. I have a friend who enjoys building his own armor and swords, and I paid him to modify a sword and scabbard to look just like Aragorn's. Another friend I know does theatrical makeup. She did my wife's makeup and hair and got her elf ears to look real, and she added some dirt to my face to help me look like I'd been living in the woods for a month. We trimmed our hair to match the characters, and dyed it. I grew out my beard and trimmed it to look like Aragorn's three-day growth. (The only detail we skipped was buying colored contact lenses. We decided not to go that far, and it's hard to get the color just right.)  

The night of the big party came. We put on our costumes, did our final hair and makeup, and we looked *perfect!* We could have walked onto the movie set and started filming. We were so happy and excited. When we arrived at the party, our costumes were a big hit. Everybody was wearing a costume, but most people went with store-bought ones. Some people had made their own, but no one had put in the hours and hours of work that we had. Our costumes were head and shoulders above the rest and we got many compliments. It was very satisfying to have your hard work appreciated.   

As I said, there was a prize for the best costume. This year it was a $20 Starbucks gift card. My wife and I exchanged knowing glances, we knew we were sure to win. Everyone at the party voted for the best costume. Susan had a plastic jack o' lantern she passed around, and everyone wrote down their vote on a slip of paper and put it in. At the stroke of midnight, Susan would count the votes and award the prize. Unfortunately, my wife and I couldn't stay that late since we had a baby at home. We cast our votes early, thanked Susan for throwing such a great party, and left around 10 o'clock. Susan said she would call us the next day if we had won. Winning the contest wasn't such a big deal, but it would have made us feel good to know our efforts had been recognized. 

The next day was a Saturday. Late that morning, my wife's phone rang. I heard her say, ""Hi, Susan...really? That's great!"" and she gave me a thumbs-up. Hooray! We were the best costume! She and Susan chatted for a while and I went in to the next room. When my wife joined me later, she had a funny look on her face.  

""So, we won?"" I asked.  

""Yesss..."" she said, ""actually *you* did.""  

""Cool.""  

""Yeah..."" she said, with that odd look still on her face.  

""What's wrong?""  

""Well, there was some confusion. Everybody voted for 'Peter Pan.'""  

""What?""  

""Peter Pan,"" she repeated.  

""I wasn't Peter Pan,"" I said.  

""I know,"" she said, ""I told her that. I said that I was Arwen and you were Aragorn.""  

""And what did she say?""  

""She said, 'Who's Aragorn?'""  

""Oh, no,"" I said.  

""I guess no one at the party has seen the movies.""  

""I guess not,"" I said. I felt myself curling into a little ball on the couch. ""Everyone thought I came dressed as Peter Pan?""  

""I think so,"" she said.  

""Oh my God,"" I said.  

""So, anyway, Susan's home right now. She wanted to know if you wanted to drive over and pick up your prize.""  

""Do I have to?""  

""Yes,"" she said, ""It would be rude if you didn't.""  

""I suppose so.""  

She patted my knee, ""Would you like to take the car, or would you rather use your magic fairy dust to fly over there?""  

""This isn't funny,"" I said.  

""It's a little bit funny,"" she said.  

 So I drove to Susan's and claimed my prize. Susan greeted me at the door and apologized for thinking I was Peter Pan instead of ""The Wizard from the Rings or Whatever."" I told her no apology was necessary, and I thanked her again for putting on such a wonderful party. She told me to save the date for next year. I stopped by Starbucks on the way home and got a coffee. It tasted pretty good.  

My friends who had helped us with our costumes were eager to hear how it had all worked out. I told them it went perfectly, and our costumes were a big hit. They were happy to hear it and offered to help us out with next year's costume when the time came. My wife and I went to many more of Susan's parties and always had a great time, but we never again put so much work into our costumes. After our weeks of work had resulted in ""the Peter Pan incident,"" we opted for simpler costumes in the following years. I invested in a high-quality gorilla suit which I wore to nearly every party afterwards. It's been a good investment. Gorilla suits never go out of style, and I never get mistaken for anything else.",31Oct2020,1

In fact, raising the underage version of him definitely feels like that last real, fulfilling, and useful thing I've done with my life, and my mind constantly reminds me of every mistake I ever made with him. I constantly wish I could have done better, even though I didn't do that bad, because I just wanted it to be great for him.   


I've struggled, especially over the last ten years or so to find a way to be more useful, have fulfilling exchanges, and to make my son and my mom proud of what I can do, and what I've become. I have a good little handful of interests, and some minor talents in things, but a much longer list of problems producing anything out of it. I was on disability for a while, and was recently kicked off the rolls because I couldn't produce names of doctors I went to, or medicines I took, because I quit doing those things. Of course, that made me feel even more useless, because while I always felt useless just getting money for having mental illness rather than for being a useful member of society, now I couldn't even help pay bills, or buy minor items for consumption, etc.   


After losing my only income, some family members tried to help me feel better about myself, build me up, and help me dream of doing some things that would help me get back on my feet. These ideas really helped me feel pumped for many months. I was told that some of them would be teaching me skills, and others would help me out with some starting cash to afford supplies until I got things under way so that I could pay for my own. Well, after a major move across country, some health problems with some elder relatives, etc, no one's been able to afford to show me skills except for showing me how to fix one shed door, and no one's been able to afford to get any supplies. Understandable. But, after about a year of it being this way, I really don't expect to learn much, or to get supplies. And with my mental instability, it's probably not that realistically feasible, anyway. That was a truth I tried hard not to face for a very long time, but now, it's not so scary or depressing to face.   


I recently lost my furbaby to a car ripping down the road by my house. For 7 years, and 11 months she was the best therapy I could have asked for. Her passing has plunged me into a depression like I haven't experienced for as long as she's been alive. Lots of other things have been lost, too, in the move. The ways I used to live and cope aren't possible, anymore. And the things I've dreamed of changing and moving up to aren't happening.   


I still need to have books to read, internet to occupy my time with when I'm awake, a decent place to sleep, and coffee. All else, can go. If I don't need much, I'm not really that much of a burden. Most of the other things I indulged in can go if I'm going to live an isolated life, anyway. Most of those things helped me bolster social interaction, but if I'm failing so hard at social interaction and useful contribution, why worry about maintaining things I can't support? I'm letting them go. It will be a little difficult at first, but reading and listening to music, and watching cartoons have been a mainstay for me since I was a kid, and I can return to being dependent on them. Coffee will get bought whether I ask for it, or not. My mom, despite her age, is more dependent on internet service than I am. I don't need a phone anymore, if I ever did. I don't need games, anymore. I don't need a few other things, either.   


No more dreaming of breaking through my problems to ""make it,"" and become self sufficient. A few people will love me no matter what, and have loved me through all these problems and struggles for years, already. The struggle to change my circumstances and fail repeatedly has caused me more unhappiness than anything. Now, I really don't care if I ever learn skills, sell those skills, or anything. It really doesn't matter, and it changes nothing. I've been this person for most of my life, and now I'm just accepting it. Sure. I may not matter much, but being brave enough to exist through it until my life ends naturally is the best way to go for anyone that's connected to me. I don't have to entertain thoughts of ending life. I can just exist. I don't have to purposely cause harm to those around me just because I can't break out of being what I am.   


And I don't have to cause anyone any consternation by needing things. I don't need rides, a doctor, instruction, or cash for anything, anymore. If there's decent food, I'll eat it. If not, I'm literally not going to starve. I don't even need to explain it to the people in my life. They'll eventually figure it out and accept it, too. In fact, they may not even cognitively notice it. It will just become the new normal. No struggle to spectate. What I once considered to be a, ""nothing life,"" depressing, and void of hope is now clearly just fine. There's no reason to hate it, or dread it. It will simply be what it is, and in a way always has been. I don't have to worry about trying to remove creative blocks that have been there for years. Just occupy my mind while awake, and sleep the rest of the time. Watch some tv with family members here and there when I'm up to it, and empathize with their lives a little. Nothing else is required or important. This is the most liberation I've felt in decades.",31Oct2020,1

I‚Äôm feeling immense guilt about some of his problems (paying rent, alcoholism) even though I‚Äôve done more than enough to try to help him. He sounded really low last night..

66,"Hello everyone. I'm sure all of us have had trouble adjusting to 2020 and the pandemic. I've gotten used to not going out much, most of my days are spent inside with my girlfriend and our cats, and about twice a month we have get togethers with our small group of friends. It's weird, but we've adjusted.

My family however, cannot accept this fact and continues to put everyone at risk almost daily. They are constantly trying to attend sporting events and parties, and are always talking about traveling. I try and talk to them about this, but it's no use. My parents are very conservative and haven't taken the pandemic very seriously since the start, and with Thanksgiving coming around the corner, I really don't think it's a good idea to have my entire extended family gathered in one place. I tried to ask them if we could have a small family dinner instead (just our immediate family plus SO) but I was told that I was disrespecting the rest of our family.

At this point, I don't think I will attend Thanksgiving if it happens, and I already know that my family will give me so much shit if I don't. Has anybody else had to deal with this? Any help?",31Oct2020,1
67,"This is weird but it just hit me recently. I‚Äôve grown up with little no love in my life. I‚Äôve always been the loner even though I come from a family of 7 kids. Hard being the only daughter, much less the middle child of it all too. My parents are traditional and treat my brothers with more respect than they do with me so my life has always been proving myself to them, that I‚Äôm not just an object that has to me sanctioned off into marriage and slave away in the kitchen. My parents and my brothers would always tell me that I‚Äôm too guy-like because I would challenge their ideas at the dinner table or I‚Äôd become captain of whatever sport team I was in in high school and win championships or kick ass in debate. I remember my dad telling me that ‚Äúsmart women don‚Äôt get men.‚Äù

I thought this was true. I‚Äôm nearly 20 years old and I‚Äôve been more or less single. I could never hold anything down because guys would tell me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre too busy‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre intimidating‚Äù or ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt keep up with you‚Äù but my work ethic, how much my education means to me, and how much I crave success is greater than whatever my family tells me or whatever these guys tell me.

I know I‚Äôm only, what, 19 right now but I have been feeling the loneliness. No support from my parents. No support from my brothers. I have my best friend who has done so much for me and listened to me bitch about my feelings all the time - bless his soul - and remained my rock but he‚Äôs got his own problems and we have different paths in life.

Corona hit earlier this year and it got worse. So, in order to fill the void I just... started a company. I don‚Äôt know anything else to do but work. So now I‚Äôm building a company while going to school full-time and working 2 part-time jobs.

Just because I feel lonely.

There was a guy I was loosely friends with. Kind of like that seasonal friend, you know? They always start texting you at a certain time of the year and then stop talking to you when that season is over. I‚Äôd met him in high school at prom night after my date/boyfriend at the time ditched me to go hook up with his date/my boyfriend‚Äôs ex and we had both somehow ended up at the roof of the event building talking about the stars and telling each other stories until the venue closed down and the doors locked so we spent the better part of our night escaping the building and then going to iHop and eating late-night pancakes. We exchanged numbers + snaps that night and always end up talking around that time of the year before the conversation would die down and we‚Äôd do it again next year.

We got to talking again, as usual, but it was different for some reason. Our text threads became more frequent as he was intrigued with my company. We started doing weekend Netflix Parties - every Saturday night without fail we would pick a movie and watch it and message each other on chat. We started FaceTiming. I told him all about what I was doing and he actually seemed.... intrigued.

We ended up both getting tested, making sure we were negative, remained 6 feet apart, and sanitized our hands for our first 15 dates. It was nice seeing him, talking to him, having someone that was interested in me and supporting me and vice versa.

I always had the notion that I would be alone, ya know? Like, in my dreams, I‚Äôd be successful and comfortable with my life but I never really envisioned someone by my side and not any kids because I know I‚Äôd be too busy to give them the full attention and affection needed to make up for not having a second parent.

Date 16 was when I finally thought it was a possibility. Against both of our best judgements. We ditched the masks and I went over to his place for the first time and we did cooking, baking, and movie night instead of Netflix party night. We were just cuddling on the couch having demolished some bomb ass burgers, fries, and brownies. We were ‚Äúwatching‚Äù Home Alone.

I don‚Äôt know how our convo changed but he told me he‚Äôd been trying to talk to me for so long. To hang out again after we met back when I was 16 and he was almost 18 so he‚Äôd always text me around that time of year. He didn‚Äôt know how to talk to me and he felt like I wasn‚Äôt interested in him which is why he‚Äôd stop texting me after a while. He‚Äôd also say that he‚Äôd been keeping up with my work - buying and reading newspaper articles I‚Äôd write, keeping updated on college teams I‚Äôm in and show up to scrimmage games against other teams with his friends to cheer us on, but always give me my space because he thought I was too busy or wasn‚Äôt interested.

I felt bad. Maybe I had thrown myself so much into work that I was disabling myself from seeing anyone. So, in a moment of determination, I asked him if he wanted to be mutually exclusive. I don‚Äôt know where it came from or if it was too fast or if I‚Äôm making a mistake but I knew right then and there this is the person I want to be with.

He said yes.

It‚Äôs been 4 months now and last night he asked to make things official. I said yes.

Now I know you‚Äôre thinking ‚Äúyou‚Äôre really young‚Äù or ‚Äúit hasn‚Äôt been that long‚Äù trust me my best friend said the same thing when I told him. The only thing is, I can actually see a future with this guy. Not because he says all these little things to me but because he shows it to me too. My company has been growing rapidly and I‚Äôm seeing success and he‚Äôs been by my side, helping me practice before I pitch to investors, dropping me off and picking me up when I‚Äôm incredibly stressed and calming me down before meetings because I do get scared. He‚Äôs open with me. Honest with me. Never pressured me into anything. Supports me in a way that I have never received and I‚Äôve just been so shocked.

I told him about my family and how I don‚Äôt know how to love so there are times that I get a little uncomfortable or weird because I don‚Äôt know how to show my affection but he‚Äôs been patient with me. I‚Äôve got a lot better at showing him I care and I want to do a lot for him too.

I don‚Äôt know why I typed this long message but yeah. I guess all I‚Äôm saying is I‚Äôm finally in something that I see a future in. That I see mutual growth. Mutual respect. Mutual honesty. Mutual support. Someone I‚Äôm starting to trust more and more. Someone that I can relax with, cry to, laugh with, and anything in between.

We‚Äôre taking it slowly though because I have a lot to learn and we‚Äôre working at a pace that‚Äôs best for us.

I really like it.

70,"I am posting to ask for some honest opinions about how I should handle this situation. I am not one to confront people. I will avoid confrontation at all cost, and usually, I would simply drop someone all together without a single word of explanation to them if they were to do something that I deemed ""friendship ending"" because I don't see the point in discussing things that I won't change my mind about. This, however, is a bit different, because I already stopped talking to her after she fucked my birthday off last year, then after about 6 months I reconnected with her and lied to her about why I stopped talking to her. I told her it was just because of what was going on in my life, and she understood because of course she knew from my perspective, 2019 was the worst year of my life. I will provide you the details of both of these birthday situations below.  


2019 the year of hell: My best friend texts me about a week before my birthday to confirm that we will be keeping our ""tradition"" of taking the other to lunch on their birthday. I told her I would love that, and that if I didn't get to do anything else for my birthday the least I wanted to do was go to our birthday lunch celebration. She agreed, we made plans to meet after we got out of our classes in the afternoon. I texted her the day of, telling her I was looking forward to our lunch and she responded ""oh, I have a tattoo appointment today, do you want to come with me?"" I was pretty upset, but I just wanted to see her so I asked her where she was getting the tattoo at, considering going if it wasn't too far from me. It was too far from me, it was over an hour drive to go to the parlor from my college. I declined and we rescheduled lunch for a week from then. Fast forward to the next planned lunch, we meet down the street from her college, she talks about how short she is on money, how hard everything has been, we both relay our struggles but mine didn't concern money, more just entire life crisis that had been going on the whole year and she knew all about it already. Honestly, it is very safe to assume that she knew I wouldn't let her put herself out to buy me lunch and a margarita, every time we ever went to lunch and she mentioned money while we were there, I would always pick up the bill (no ill will about it! she is my best friend! I was happy to do it if she couldn't) So I bought both of us my birthday lunch and we went our separate ways. I wasn't upset about buying lunch that day when I left the restaurant. However, I became enraged when she went to get a new full set of acrylic nails later that afternoon. I went home and discussed everything from the initial date to the lunch I bought that day and her having the money to go get her nails done but not insisting on buying my birthday lunch or even bothering to buy a simple card or small present with my fianc√© and he reminded me that this was a pattern for her. She consistently did the bare minimum for me while I always went out of my way to help her and go over the top for her celebrations or even on her worst days to just make her feel better. I cut ties with her after that day and stopped responding to any form of contact she tried to make with me. I continued this until about July of this year when I was going to our mutual friend's kid's birthday party, I knew she would be there and I was honestly looking forward to it even though I knew it may be a bit awkward. I missed her. We did reconnect at that party, and after a couple of weeks I sent her a long message apologizing for treating her that way and explaining it was just what was going on in my life that forced me to distance myself from her. 

Fast forward again, after several months of normal communication through our socials and a few more small get togethers with our mutual friends, and we are at my birthday again. She texts me the day of my birthday saying Happy birthday and that she wanted to take me to lunch! I was a bit busy on my birthday and not responding to my texts, it actually took me 3 days to respond but I sent her back a response saying ""hey, thank you! when do you want to go to lunch?'' she had been working a lot and I didn't have anything on my schedule so I left it open to her, she confirmed the date and we met 2 days later at a restaurant again. This time she immediately orders her favorite appetizer and we discuss sharing an order of wings because it saved money and we could still get different sauces that we both liked. After we are done eating, just sitting an talking, the waitress comes to the table to ask how we wanted the bill split. I say ""uh..."" and heavy pause waiting for my friend to interject and say it is one bill, but instead she says ""split it even."" I was speechless. I actually didn't have the money to blow on a lunch, and if anyone else had invited me to lunch I would have told them no because I just simply didn't want to spend my last dime on it. But she invited ME to lunch, for MY BIRTHDAY, so in no world did I think I would be paying for it, especially after her sitting down and immediately ordering her favorite appetizer. I am ready at this point to cut communication with her again, but knowing full well we will be forced to be around each other many times in the future. Our friend group is very intertwined, and her fianc√© is one of my fianc√©s best friend (and honestly, one of my good friends too!)

**Brief description about our company and product**

We are GEN ONE and we are located in Miami, US. A couple of people and myself got fed up with the market during the pandemic, the market was either sold out or in a group buy and was very frustrating.

We have been working on this project for five months (June/2020). I am a biochemist that works in pharmaceutical manufacturing and quality control. I have been building keyboards for about two years and custom PC's for about 6 years. I decided to start a company with like minded individuals and devote all my spare time to learning how design, create, and produce mechanical keyboards. We have a lot more picture and videos on our Instagram.

We do not have a price yet. We have all our local vendors in place and are finalizing the details for the cost to manufacture. We are in contact with various local manufacturers including PCB, Metal Milling, Metal Finishing's, Metal Anodization, and various miscellaneous manufacturers to order hex screws, etc....

We will know the price of our product by Mid to Late November. 

We are a start up and do not have a lot of funds currently. Our first keyboard will most likely be a group buy. We are trying to achieve a in stock option for a limited amount of keyboards. 

We hope you enjoy our post.",31Oct2020,1

87,"I (20 F) just got out of a long-term relationship with my best friend since middleschool. I've never had sex, but I'm looking for the right one. I don't really want someone so close anymore, so I decided to try and see who I can find online. I like reddit and decided it might be time again to start looking for people. I like videogames, drawing, memes, I love to watch anime, and I'm curious about cosplay. I don't really go outside much but I love outdoorsy games like Red Dead 2, and others. I don't really need someone who is that physically active, I'm pretty fine with whatever, so yeah. How would I even go about looking for someone?",31Oct2020,1

Anyway, he was really sweet. I told him I was feeling sad so he invited me to hang out with his family for the day! ..I ultimately decided not to stay because his brother made me feel unwelcomed and unwanted... but you know what, it meant a lot to me that he cares about me and wanted to spend time together today :) I‚Äôm glad we hung out for a few hours and had a great time. We got some comics, got some food, and now, I‚Äôm feeling a lot better. 

I have his roku. I‚Äôm not gonna start movies for another few hours, so I think I‚Äôll get a few beers, grab a seat outside, and read some new comics (and a book my friend let me borrow that I MUST return).

91,"Growing up, I was always surrounded by people who knew who their best friend was. Me? I never really had that. I thought I did twice. Once, when I was in elementary school and once when I was in college. My elementary school friendship ended when she spread a not so nice rumor about me that lead to my being bullied for years afterward. The other ended because she got upset that for the first time I had a boyfriend while she was still single and dumped me as a friend quickly and swiftly. Let's just say the last time we hung out, she told me the only reason she was there was because her date canceled and she didn't want the night to be ruined. Great feeling, amiright?

I have had other friends along the way, of course. Some ended because we drifted apart. Some ended over disagreements that were never resolved.  All lead to heartbreak on my part because I always feel like I'm left with a ""what did I do wrong"" feeling. ""Why did they leave me? Why was I not good enough? Why does no one like me?"" Now, at 22, I have thrown in the towel. I have realized that I will never be the girl who will automatically know who her maid of honor will be at my wedding, hell I can't even think of who would be my bridesmaids. I will never be the girl who has a ""girl's night"" or a ""besties"" post on my birthday, and you know what? That's ok. I'm sure there's some kind of flaw on my end that makes people drift away, or maybe it's just bad luck. Who knows, really. All I know is that this week, after a ""friend"" reached out *to me* to invite me out on Halloween only to never text me again with the details was the moment I realized sometimes?

93,"I‚Äôm a first year uni student with serious health conditions in the UK, so I think that says a lot about my situation as a whole to be honest. 

I was kicked out of my abusive home literally a week before lockdown, had to coach surf for half the year until I finally made it to university. However I‚Äôve still been having to deal with the abuse verbally and over the phone because I want to keep in contact with my younger sibling, or I lose all my family and I already feel so alone that even the toxic relationships seem meaningful. 

My mental health is basically looking up at rock bottom, and I literally cannot do anything about it. Therapy? I have to wait god knows how long until I get it through the NHS, and can‚Äôt afford it privately. I have no social life because I‚Äôve been put in accommodation that is completely separate from all the other freshers. My old friends have all moved on basically, and i can‚Äôt go out because of my health complications anyways. I‚Äôve started having more frequent panic attacks and nightmares. Im literally either always crying or numb. My memory has gone to crap and the uni workload basically drowns me every morning. 

Right now, I‚Äôm sat on my bedroom floor eating half a slice of chocolate cake alone as my celebration for Halloween, my favourite holiday ever, whilst everyone I know is out partying and dressing up and loving their night. For years I‚Äôve been telling myself that uni would change things and my first Halloween would be so free and happy and fun but this is what it is. I have spent the whole day studying so I won‚Äôt feel so upset, but I can hear the third years partying outside and all I can do is listen. 

Everyone seems to tell me that ‚Äòdon‚Äôt worry just wait till next year!‚Äô But honestly? It‚Äôs all bullshit. Next year isn‚Äôt freshers year. Next year everyone‚Äôs gonna go out with friends they‚Äôve made THIS year.

A few months went by of me doing this and I stopped doing it when my mother asked me why I was hanging up on her. She thought I was angry or upset at her. I said no and told her about where I picked it up from. She laughed and shook her head and told me it wasn't very polite.

103,"My story is clich√© and you‚Äôll probably roll your eyes and tell yourself ‚Äúwhat stupid girl‚Äù but love is something complicated, if I can call it love.

I met a boy 6 years ago, I met him just after a traumatic event that happened to me. My first crush I loved almost raped me, I had no experience with boys, he was the first guy interested in me, since I no longer trusted men.

After that, this boy immediately made me feel comfortable, he‚Äôs attentive and respectful. But he's totally different: He drinks, smokes, takes drugs. I don‚Äôt judge ! All my friends do that, but I don‚Äôt feel comfortable with it. But despite everything I've been attached to this nice boy.

He kept telling my friends how much he liked me, that he loved my innocence. But I quickly realised that he and I never talk that much. We don‚Äôt know each other so much. He spent time hitting on me when we saw each other. We were never alone. He always sends a message to my friends to invite me to parties, but he never invites me himself.

I realized that I was wasting my time with him, my best friend revealed to me that he was terrified to be in couple with me despite the attraction he had. He confides in my friends but never with me. I ended this relationship based on nothingness.

A few months later, he came back apologizing and persuading me that he had grown and changed.

And this on and off lasted 6 years...I know -__-... and during these six years we never see each other (during 2 years I was in another country and yet he came back knowing I was at the opposite of him). It was always the same thing: he sends me a long text saying that he only wanted me, we talk two minutes and after that nothing. Let me tell you before you judge me, during these six years I‚Äôve met anyone despite I‚Äôm pretty sociable, I was going out, I always make myself pretty but despite all this nobody is interested in me. And when that only boy came back I thought that only him was really interested in me.

Two weeks ago he came back and I didn‚Äôt bother sending him to go fuck himself ! He begged me, but I told him that he and I are too different and that I don‚Äôt have time for someone who doesn‚Äôt give me time. He told me things he never told me before and despite this brainwashing he gave me, I give up but the desire was not there. I have agreed to reconnect but ONLY as friends because he has always wanted to be in my life.

Surprisingly him and I, for the first time, talk about hours every day. We get to know each other very well BUT recently for four days it is more distant. Let me put you in context: I‚Äôm on vacation with my sister and I want to believe that he doesn‚Äôt want to disturb me because I‚Äôm with my family. He calls me in the evening, we‚Äôre laughing, but I feel like we have nothing more to say to us. And today he calls me again in the evening as if for him it‚Äôs a task so that I might be satisfied with his efforts but at no time he sends me messages to know what I‚Äôm doing or if I‚Äôm fine. And he barelly ask about my study he just call me, laughing and nothing more. 

I‚Äôm scared to be alone and I know it is a toxic relationship.",31Oct2020,1
104,"As I've gotten to know more people I've realised how lucky I've been growing up, since for me it was just normal life. What I mean is that my parents have done a very good job at rasing me and making me the person I am today. 

Throughout my childhood they've always been there for me, supported me and comforted me when I was sad. Home has always felt so safe and as I've gotten to know more people, I've learned that it wasn't always the case for my friends. 

My two closest friends both have parents who are divorced, one hates them for it, and the other has told me about a very uncomfortable childhood that I almost feel bad for not understanding that well. While driving today we joked about our area being a cluster of broken families, but there is a sad truth to that, a truth that I only recently fully realised.

As I've looked around with this new perspective I've only grown more appreciation for the job my parents did for my 18 years of life so far, an appreciation for the safe childhood my friends envy. I feel very lucky to have my parents around and for not making me hate my life, like so many others I've met.

Thank you mom and dad, thank you so much.",31Oct2020,1
105,"For years I trained as a track and field athlete. Primarily as a pole vaulter. That seemingly simple but highly specialized skill helped me become the first in my family to go to college and opened up whole new worlds. 

As a result, I have a passion for helping other kids from similar backgrounds access opportunities through track and field, so as soon as my work schedule afforded me time, I started assistant coaching a team at a community center. 

It had always been my favorite part of the week until Cooper, a new coach, showed up. 

He had pretty impressive stats and all the local celebrities knew who he was and said we were lucky to have him. I‚Äôd moved to this town for work so didn‚Äôt know the scene like I did back home, but apparently he‚Äôd been some big deal in high school then had to turn down college offers due to some kind of resistance to moving out of state (he didn‚Äôt get any offers from in state schools.)

All the kids thought Cooper was the hottest thing since sliced bread for the same reasons I thought he was a bit of a loser. He was living off of his parents without a lucrative job at 30+, dyed his unwashed hair neon colors, drove a motorcycle, and watched all the same cartoons the team did. We coached 6-10 year olds. 

From the moment I first laid eyes on Cooper I did not like him. There‚Äôs almost no one I don‚Äôt like, usually at most people have *qualities* I don‚Äôt like but I still like them overall. This guy didn‚Äôt even have qualities I liked. I tried not to let it show though because he‚Äôd never actually *done* anything to make me not like him. It was just a feeling. 

I don‚Äôt think he liked me either though, because when it was just the two of us alone, he would never speak a word to me. I would come in to start the day‚Äôs practice and say ‚ÄúHi Cooper! How‚Äôs your week so far?‚Äù And he‚Äôd just nod at me in silence.

He‚Äôd been a really successful sprinter, and I was looking for new speed drills to run with the kids, so the head coach asked Cooper to train me in facilitating the drills. He said it was no problem and was totally affable and excited about it in the presence of the group of staff. 

The second we were alone just the two of us, he was stone faced and silent, leaving me to figure it out for myself as though the conversation had never happened. 

I‚Äôll clarify, I said he was a new coach, he wasn‚Äôt entirely new. He‚Äôd been there for six or seven years before I‚Äôd been there. But he‚Äôd taken a long break in the middle and when he returned he‚Äôd had an opposite practice schedule to me so I had never had to deal with him. 

At first I had actually leaned into that uneasy feeling he gave me initially and deliberately scheduled my practices counter to his. As a result, we were assigned athletes with unrelated areas of expertise, so were eventually booked to different days organically. 

Then there were some funding cuts and fewer practice days, so it came to a point that I‚Äôd spend 3-5 hours a week alone with Cooper, setting up and breaking down practices. 

It was at that point that I expressed my uneasiness to the head coach. 

Apparently Cooper was always a bit ‚Äúoff,‚Äù but he told everyone he had autism so to not be put out by any stilted things he said or seemingly inappropriate ways he conducted himself. 

People bought it. And I did too at first. My sister is autistic I know it can make a person unpredictable and seem irrational or unpleasant when they‚Äôre actually just being misunderstood. 

But then the weather changed. 

It got cold and we were pushed indoors. So, instead of Cooper off on a distant field and myself on another, we were sharing a single gymnasium. This was the first time I saw how he ran his practices. 

There was just something about how he interacted with the kids that made my skin crawl. He was distinctly childlike. Not in a good way. In a way that crossed a boundary and disrupted the power dynamic of coach-athlete and crossed over into peer-to-peer territory. As a 30 something year old guy, he was trying way too hard to be friends with 6-10 year olds.

But it was tempered with an extreme level of control and discipline exerted over his group that again violated boundaries in another direction, going beyond meticulous coaching and entering into abusive territory. 

His 7 year old runner wouldn‚Äôt make the mile goal they‚Äôd set for the week and he‚Äôd be shouting at the top of his lungs berating the kid. 

He had this Jekyll and Hyde personality where he‚Äôd go from overly saccharine best of friend childlike wonderment demeanor to Full Metal Jacket wartime drill sergeant in a split second. 

He also played clear favorites. He‚Äôd spend significantly more time perfecting and assisting a select few athletes and blatantly ignore others. 

A boy among his favorites, Jordan, developed an interest in pole vaulting so switched over to my practices. When Cooper found out, he flew into a rage. Jordan was a sweet nerdy little kid with big goggles and a soft voice. Not someone who takes being blown up at (or about) well. 

In front of half my team, Cooper was screaming things like, ‚ÄúYou forced him, didn‚Äôt you? You manipulated him into changing practices because you want the credit of all the best prospects. You know I developed Jordan from day one and he‚Äôs mine and we have a connection you could never understand. He‚Äôll never see his full potential with you!‚Äù And on and on. 

Meanwhile I‚Äôm thinking, ‚ÄúBro, chill. He‚Äôs 8 and he wants to try a variety of activities in his after school sport. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs here. What. The. Fuck.‚Äù 

That incident was kind of the tipping point in my concerns about him. 

The favoritism had been eating away at me for some time, because it not only raised some personal red flags, but I could see it eroding the confidence of those athletes who weren‚Äôt the favorites. Who he favored did not even directly correspond to athletic capability. Jordan was a middling athlete in terms of stats or build or things like that. And we had to remember we were dealing with recreational young kids, not olympic hopefuls. 

So, I brought these concerns to the head coach, who was present in our end of program less and less to be off in another facility working with the high schoolers, and his response was basically ‚ÄúPeople love sausage but they don‚Äôt always like how it‚Äôs made. Cooper‚Äôs team sees great results. They‚Äôre sticking with the sport and moving into our advanced program. They‚Äôll probably almost all get private high school offers or local varsity opportunities. Every other coach on our staff finds him quite enjoyable to work with and has learned a good deal from him.‚Äù Etc. Etc. Etc. He wasn‚Äôt really trying to hear me. 

So, I just focused on making my aspect of the program as strong as it could be in the hopes it would attract a lot of athletes and afford me a position of power to box Cooper out and minimize his involvement with the athletes. 

Then the gender segregation thing started. 

I showed up to practice a bit late one day due to a traffic ticket I had to contest. I let Cooper know I would be late and begrudgingly asked him to start my practice for me. He said no problem.

When I arrived, my previously co-ed team was only girls. All my boys had been moved over to his team and he‚Äôd given me all his girls. 

I had been working with some of my male athletes for 3+ years and this switch from co-ed to gender segregated at ages 6-10 was unprecedented. 

I thought maybe it was for some specific activity that they would finish up then return to regular teams. Nope. Cooper let me know he‚Äôd made an executive decision to switch the rosters up, even though he now had a bunch of pole vaulters and next to no vaulting experience, and kids with distance aspirations on his team that never did longer than an 800m run in their practices. It was completely illogical. 

I was furious to see the hard work I had put in with my athletes derailed this way and called up the head coach once again. Even he said this was a weird move and the young athletes were supposed to be in the co-ed groups assigned during try-outs at the beginning of the season.  

All of a sudden Cooper shed his supposed social anxiety from his self proclaimed autism enough to make a very convincing case about boys needing a masculine role model because of not having stable father figures in the home and the presence of lots of girls impeding the bonding process. 

And girls needing to learn to work together in a single sexed team because that‚Äôs how high school and college squads would be configured and social drama couldn‚Äôt be getting in the way of their training. (Great, sexist and creepy all at once.) 

I made it clear I was adamantly opposed to this and almost considered quitting, but I was again met with ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the only coach who has a problem with Cooper. Everyone else likes him and thinks segregating the teams is a good idea.‚Äù 

I then also worried what would happen if I quit and was replaced with someone who wasn‚Äôt at all skeptical of Cooper so didn‚Äôt keep an eye on him. 

I shut my mouth and just hung back to observe, but I kept my eyes and ears open. It took one week for the new girls on my team to start talking about they liked the feedback they got since making the switch because they got no real attention from Cooper (even some who had been with us for years), which led to proclamations about how he only worked seriously with the boys, and how even among the boys, he had clear favorites. They said when they‚Äôd raised concerns or their parents had they‚Äôd been told to excuse it as symptoms of his autism and that senior staff had spoken to him about it. 

Hearing these red flags echoed from young athletes within his team just reaffirmed the uneasy feelings I‚Äôd been having ever since we‚Äôd met. 

Some of the girls had brothers in the track program so I did all I could think to without losing my job ‚Äî  and leaving Cooper unchecked, with no tangible proof to bring forward about him ‚Äî I encouraged the girls to have their brothers complain about the favoritism. Since they were still on his team. 

It worked. The rabid sports parents hated the idea that some kids were getting more specialized training than others, and started asking why their daughters weren‚Äôt getting to train with the elite coach anymore, and why their sons now felt some athletes got more of the coach‚Äôs attention than others. 

Whatever answer he gave was apparently not sufficient because a lot of parents decided they wanted to start sitting in on practices. 

We had no rule against parents staying for practices, they just didn‚Äôt usually do it because they were busy at work or with their other kids or just trusted us. But now parents were paying attention. Worried less about their kids athletic development and moreso making sure everything was on the up and up within our program. 

We were in the real hard core streets of this neighborhood. None of the parents had a problem pulling a seat right up front to observe. And in a legitimate youth program, no one should have a problem with them doing so. 

But Cooper wasn‚Äôt a fan of this and quickly concocted an excuse about young kids not needing parental pressure when trying to enjoy a fun sport and ‚ÄúThe audience getting in the way of their training.‚Äù He outlawed parents from viewing his practices. 

That‚Äôs where the head coach drew a line in the sand, even for his golden child. He let Cooper know, in no uncertain terms, parents had every right to sit in on practices. 

They got into a real blowout over this, with Cooper demanding ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you trust me with kids?‚Äù And ‚ÄúI should get to run my practice my way, I don‚Äôt need fat ass parents looking over my shoulder commenting on how I do my work. The kids aren‚Äôt themselves around their parents. You wouldn‚Äôt understand.‚Äù Highly inappropriate and unusual remarks for anyone, let alone a seasoned professional.  

It was eventually settled that parents could sit in a bleacher section of the gymnasium, visible to but not pressed up against, the practice. 

So of course the first day that this was set to be the arrangement, Cooper planned a loop around the *outside* of the facilities, even though it was barely 30 degrees Fahrenheit out. 

I was surprised, but for the first time in months I didn‚Äôt pay too much attention to his practice, because I knew he had a roomful of watchful parents to answer to now. 

The parents were not motivated to get up and follow their children outside because it was drizzling on and off and they were just doing a few laps around the medium sized building. 

It took me seven minutes and nineteen seconds to notice. 

I know because I had just started timing my own team on a series when Cooper‚Äôs team went out the door. 

Cooper took his gym bag when the team left to jog those laps. There‚Äôs no reason he should have been taking a bag with him for running anywhere. No reason his personal affects should need to leave the gym and be going outside with the team if they were coming right back. 

I instructed my kids to go line up against the wall, made sure the row full of parents had an eye on them and knew that no one was to move, and I dashed outside. 

I saw the kids running but Cooper wasn‚Äôt anywhere to be found. I knew something was amiss but wasn‚Äôt sure what. I started counting the kids. He was two short. 

‚ÄúDid everyone come in today? Is everyone from your team here today, did they show up?‚Äù I choked out to the older kids. ‚ÄúUh... no.‚Äù Someone called out, thinking about it. ‚ÄúOk, ok, who? How many?‚Äù ‚ÄúLucius is grounded from sports.‚Äù Someone else called back. Well that was one. We were missing two. ‚ÄúAnyone else not here today?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù ‚ÄúNope.‚Äù ‚ÄúUh-uh.‚Äù The team affirmed. 

I could feel the blood draining down to my toes. Who was missing, who was missing, who was missing, what do I do? Then I realized, as the panic shook off and adrenaline set in, spurring me to action, the more obvious question is where was Cooper?

I asked the team where he went and it answered two questions at once. A younger kid explained, ‚ÄúCoach Cooper took Jordan to go somewhere in his car.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright.‚Äù I was thinking to myself. ‚Äú911. 911, I need to call 911, that‚Äôs what I need to do.‚Äù I started frantically patting my pockets but quickly remembered I was at work and my phone was in my locker. 

My vocal chords constricted from the rush of fear hitting my nervous system but I managed to flag an elderly couple down in the far end of the parking lot, yelling, ‚ÄúPhone! Cell phone! Hello, do you have a cell phone?‚Äù

I guess I was too far away for them to hear me because the wife called back ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre looking for what?‚Äú And the husband turned to her and enunciated, ‚ÄúA phone, a mobile telephone.‚Äù 

Before I could command my legs to reach her she said, ‚ÄúOh, oh. Haven‚Äôt seen it, sorry.‚Äù And slid into her drivers seat and started to pull out. 

My body finally caught up to my mind just as they were beginning to back their car out and I threw myself against the side. Maybe not the safest thing to do, but, there was an emergency at hand. 

I started pounding on the drivers side window yelling ‚ÄúNo, *your* phone. I need your phone!‚Äù 

The poor old people thought I was trying to rob them. I was blocking their car at this point demanding their cell phone so the older woman turned to her husband and cried ‚ÄúOh, George, call the police!‚Äù

I realized that was a much more sensible request so I went, ‚Äú*Yes*, YES, please call the police. CALL THE POLICE. 911!‚Äù 

I was scrambling to wrap my head around the situation. It had actually only been about a single minute since I‚Äôd been informed Cooper took Jordan away in a car. 

I waited to be sure the police were being called and then I realized, my second biggest problem, I had a huge group of unsupervised young kids outside in a parking lot. 

I screamed back to them to get against the wall in their numbers (it was an ordered grouping we used when moving from one field to another or when dismissing them from practice to their parents for easy head counts. They knew when they got in their numbers not to move and not to screw around.) 

I think they saw how keyed up I was and it froze them into silence. They just waited to see what I did next, evolutionary instinct telling them danger was present. 

The older couple had 911 on the line and they were telling the operator that they weren‚Äôt sure what was going on, that they were leaving the gym and chaos broke out in the parking lot. 

I started crying out, ‚ÄúHe took a kid! He took him in his car! Jordan Perez. Jordan Perez. His mom, Yesenia Perez, works at the processing plant on Elm. She‚Äôs there now. Someone go get her and tell her what happened. Oh my God please hurry please send police please hurry. He took him, he took him in his car. Oh my God, he took him in his car.‚Äù  

The elderly couple gave the operator some information. I was asked some questions but I don‚Äôt remember answering them anymore, I probably wasn‚Äôt much help. By this point a few parents had come out to see what was taking so long for both coaches to be gone leaving a whole team unsupervised inside. 

And it unfolded from there. 

They immediately began a search for his car. For guys with his district green hair. For Jordan. For his mom at work. The parents could not believe that in the split second they watched their sons jog out the door, they‚Äôd entered a crime scene and witnessed a kidnapping. 

Jordan‚Äôs mother was pulled off the line from work and she was hysterical. Just completely beside herself. She didn‚Äôt have much English fluency so it was even harder to have to hear the detectives say every gut wrenching thing and then wait 30 seconds for her to process it as she waited for the translator say it. 

Let me tell you right now, add a mother hearing ‚ÄúAt this time we believe your son has been abducted by this individual,‚Äù to the list of things you never want to see firsthand. 

As detectives spoke to his athletes, we learned Cooper would often talk about feeling like ‚Äújust a big kid,‚Äù and complain to his team about the ‚Äúrules society imposes on him,‚Äù and suggest it would be great if they could just live by the beach without anyone telling them what to do. 

Apparently this whole ‚Äúkid trapped in a child‚Äôs body‚Äù thing had become a major fixation for him and was the analogy he was using to explain a lot of his development delays and idiosyncrasies that by all later accounts really were just a form of autism. 

But, being with his team was the only time he felt completely at peace and ‚Äúone of the guys‚Äù so to speak. He didn‚Äôt really fit in with the girls, so eventually he just tried to organize them out of his life. 

I didn‚Äôt know this next part at the time, but in the following weeks, I‚Äôd hear from various people involved until I‚Äôd pieced together the whole story. 

Cooper had continued trying to organize those he didn‚Äôt fit in with or who disapproved of his lifestyle out of his life until eventually he‚Äôd formulated a plan that involved he and his favorites on the team going off and starting a new life together. 

He had this very childlike short term view of the plan that did not factor adult responsibilities or real world consequences into the aftermath, and basically envisioned hiding out in his parents beach cottage with his 10 year old friends for the rest of his life. 

He began cautiously introducing the idea leaving  regular life behind and starting over without rules, without school, without parents, and living some radical free wheeling existence by the sea. It turns out some kids liked their lived just fine but others bought into this escapist fantasy. He then winnowed down his favorites to even smaller numbers. 

Apparently Cooper wasn‚Äôt so involved with his parents because he was a deadbeat, but because their oversight was necessary in helping him organize a functional life. 

They offered him financial support if he took steps to maintain a job and participate actively in society rather than isolating himself in his apartment playing video games. 

The breaking point apparently came when Cooper‚Äôs parents found out he hadn‚Äôt been adhering to some financial agreement they‚Äôd set in which he allocated a certain portion of his paycheck to his own groceries, utilities and other expenses. 

He told them he was making significantly less than he was at his day job (coaching was a second job for all of us) and using the money on luxury items while his parents, who had their own financial struggles, were footing the bill for his necessities thinking he made less than he did. 

Apparently on this day they confronted him about it and he flew into a rage. Saying he‚Äôd never come back. But it was an empty threat he‚Äôd made a dozen times before and they thought nothing of it, figuring he‚Äôd cool off and they‚Äôd talk about it then. 

But instead he decided it was the day he put his master plan in place and escape all this tyranny he‚Äôd fallen victim to. He didn‚Äôt have zero foresight into this plan of his, but not much. I got most of this explanation, second and third hand, but apparently his scheme to evade detection if anyone came to use the beach house was just to take his friends and camp on the beach until the cars had gone. 

The good news is he wasn‚Äôt a pervert or anything. He really just wanted to hang out with his new friends at his beach house without anyone telling him what to do, and thought he was liberating them from their complaints of unfair parents who make them go to school and do chores. 

A few kids had tried to tell their parents what Cooper had suggested, but they wrote it off as their kids exaggerating, or just outright lying. Because of course no 30 year old adult who holds down a job would suggest a third grader never do homework again by running away, right? 

Well, the more the kids began to understand Cooper‚Äôs childlike whimsy had a dark side, the less they wanted to hang out with him. Remember that dark side of controlling rage I‚Äôd mentioned? They‚Äôd begun to see it more and more when Cooper eliminated the girls from the team but found it still wasn‚Äôt the friends-only wonderland of playhouse acceptance he had anticipated. He grew more and more paranoid that his athletes were conspiring against his plan for freedom. 

The day he abducted Jordan, Jordan was one of the only boys on the team still solidly in his corner. But, Jordan didn‚Äôt fully understand the plan. He thought this was going to be like a vacation. After driving for a bit, apparently he sensed Cooper was nervous, so got scared himself. Jordan asked to call his mom. 

Cooper explained the whole point of this escape was so he would never have to see his mom again. Jordan, a young child, absolutely panicked at that statement (as anyone at any age probably would.)

Cooper had always been very rule oriented and very plan oriented. He hated when something didn‚Äôt go as it was planned out or when a person didn‚Äôt adhere to a social more as it had been previously explained to him. So, this sent him into a rage, and he started melting down. 

Meanwhile, the police were with us at practice. No one was allowed in or out of the gym facilities. Everyone was questioned as to what they knew about Cooper and what they might have seen today. None of that helped with the most pressing concern, getting Jordan back safely. 

As much of a total buffoon as the head coach turned out to be, to his credit, he did know to call Cooper‚Äôs parents the minute he was apprised of the situation. 

Cooper‚Äôs parents were stunned. You could tell from their expressions and the tones of their voices as they arrived that the whole thing was like some strange dream to them. It was surreal to me too, but not to the same degree. Every statement they made had the inflection of a question, as though they kept thinking they‚Äôd be corrected and told their son hadn‚Äôt really committed the premeditated kidnapping of an elementary school child. 

At this time they‚Äôd heard a few different versions of where Cooper was planning to spend the rest of his life. It turned out to be the family beach cottage, but some players just said he was going home, most said ‚Äúthe beach‚Äù, a few others said ‚ÄúHawaii‚Äù and apparently one even said ‚ÄúBuenos Aires.‚Äù 

Because they had no way to definitely tell anything, they had to take each speculative claim from the kids seriously. What a nightmare. 

His parents quickly remembered, though, that even though Cooper had evidently ditched his phone, he was wearing a fit bit type watch that they‚Äôd purchased him one Christmas. They unlocked it‚Äôs GPS tracking and the cops apprehended Cooper and Jordan before they‚Äôd even gone ahead and issued an Amber Alert. 

Of course, I wasn‚Äôt there when they got him, but I‚Äôve heard different versions of the story that all seem to agree on the following points: 

Jordan was terrified (but unharmed) and just wanted to see his mom. Cooper was irate thinking Jordan had somehow called the police, so felt betrayed by him, and went from seething anger to crushing sadness. Understandably, no accounts recall any sympathy for him at the time of Jordan‚Äôs recovery. 

Jordan‚Äôs family almost moved ahead with charges but ended up settling it before it moved ahead to trial with some kind of agreement that put a mark on Cooper‚Äôs record preventing him from working with kids again and his family‚Äôs assurances they were much more closely monitoring the situation now than they had been before. 

I‚Äôm told his parents were nothing but apologetic throughout the entire process and even though they were struggling themselves from having to support Cooper past the time they‚Äôd intended to retire on top of their own extraneous medical bills, they proactively volunteered a large out of court settlement that friends and family were going to help them pay. The friends and family probably did it to keep Cooper out of a trial and away from prison, but his parents seemed genuinely horrified and sorry for what Cooper put that family through. 

The track and field program fell through pretty much right away after the incident. And it‚Äôs a shame, because it was doing great things for the community. But I don‚Äôt blame everyone for wanting nothing to do with us ever again. I couldn‚Äôt go anywhere near the place it occurred and  I took a break from coaching. 

The whole thing was a big contributing factor to my beginning to look for opportunities to relocate back to my home town. Even driving in the neighborhood of the place could make me physically sick. 

Eventually I found the right job in the right place and after I got settled I did start coaching again. But I remain hyper sensitive about anyone who wants to make any last minute roster changes or who plays favorites, and I never let any I‚Äôm coaching with take the kids out of other adults‚Äô lines of sight. They think I overreact, and I couldn‚Äôt care less. I just wish I‚Äôd adopted this attitude sooner. As I wish I‚Äôd said long ago, Cooper, let‚Äôs not meet.

*I see let‚Äôs not meet doesn‚Äôt allow throwaways for some reason? Maybe that‚Äôs why someone only posts there every three to five days now...? sad to see their decline, I used to read them a bunch of years ago.

Anyways, I would never post this with my identifiable account, so, brought it to this sub instead.*",31Oct2020,1

108,"There's this girl. A long time ago, we were very close. We actually only knew each other for about two years, but she had probably the biggest impact on my life of anyone I have ever met. I was 18, I was pretty stupid, I didn't express my feelings. Looking back, it was a huge mistake, because she really was amazing. But anyway, that is in the past. We stopped talking, rather suddenly actually. Nothing really happened, we didn't have a fight, we just stopped talking. With me being young and dumb, I didn't bother to ask what was going on. Days turned into a week, a week turned into a month and now here we are, five years later almost. 

I think about her occasionally, I think about how different life could have been if I told her how I really felt. I'm 99% sure we both had feelings for each other and just didn't know how to bring up the subject. But yesterday I was really thinking about her. I wasn't feeling great, I haven't had the best week and I thought to myself, ""I really miss her."" But I didn't want to reach out, I guess I was afraid she didn't really care anymore and I would be bothering her. 

I wake up this morning with a message notification. I assume it's probably spam, as most of my messages are bots trying to get me to click on a page. But to my surprise, it was her. It almost didn't feel real to see her name. We chatted a little bit today, it still feels strange. We've missed almost 5 years of each others lives. Things are so different, the world is so different. When we met, we were just teenagers, with our first experience of independence. Now we're grown ups, time has flown by. 

I don't really know what is next. I'm not going to fall too hard, even though I've waited 5 years for this, I don't want hurt myself. Just need to remain realistic. If we can just be friends again, I think I'd be happy with that. To be honest though, when I got to know her in the first place, I thought one day we'd end up getting married. I just had this feeling that I had never had with any other friend or girlfriend. Still to this day, it's the strongest connection I've ever felt and I often wonder if I will meet anyone else who can make me feel the same way.",31Oct2020,1
