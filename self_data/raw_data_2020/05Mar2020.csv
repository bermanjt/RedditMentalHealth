I don‚Äôt have meds because I honestly think that would help me. I‚Äôm afraid of falling into drugs. Weed has always made me paranoid, I‚Äôve never had coke, and I‚Äôm afraid shrooms will give me psychosis. I just want to be ok. I have no support and even talking to others doesn‚Äôt help me at all.

2,"(M18) Today I reconnected with my ex from like 5 years ago. We texted allright. Kinda felt like back then. A good feeling like talking to someone that finally understands you. A feeling I never had again since we broke up.

So we texted all evening and a bit into the night.
But then I somehow said something like it was back then. Like we were still together. The problem is that she has a new boyfriend now and is very happy with him. None the less I shouldn't have done that.
She obviously didn't react to good.

Now I feel terrible like we broke up all over again.
I thought a lot about her over the years and somehow really missed her sometimes. But I know it's wrong. IT's been 5 years and I should finally move on. But somehow that's a bit hard for me. 
I really don't know what to do.",05Mar2020,1
4,"Two divine architects resting romantically amid intermittently manifesting fantasies  
Despite my despair I cannot repair this suspicion that you will undermine my sanity  
Solipsism isn't the vision I saw as a boy in awe of the joy I anticipated carnally  
Maybe NPCs are the only entities I trust to truly demonstrate devotion with intensity

&amp;#x200B;

Were it possible to inhabit solitarily a world of my originality I still doubt I could live happily  
Full of all the possibilities and a universe designed to please I expect it would remain eerily empty  
Sex doll and statecraft, magic minions and take-backs, the perfect world has one drawback  
I'd find a way to realize I'm alone and my toys don't have a mind of their own to grant love traction

&amp;#x200B;

It remains a mystery to me why I desire desperately the love of another consciously  
It renders me helplessly dependent on the generosity of a selfishly descended animal species  
There is no soul mate perfectly prepared for me waiting in the wings of destiny  
So what hope do I have if I spoke no lies, a misanthrope hung with the same rope I naively used to cope with the life I so despised

&amp;#x200B;

Caught in a quick sand reverie, I'm lost on repeat in a dark web of dreams  
Delirious and disappointed in reality's disjointed decaying entropic disease  
My fantasies aren't tangible and technology can't handle the task of rendering the thoughts I can conceive

8,"It‚Äôs hard to try and grow as a person when you have a lifetime of burned bridges and neglected/ghosted relationships and friendships. The shame is unbearable sometimes.

I have to find a balance between acknowledging my wrongdoings and attacking myself for them, because it‚Äôs so easy to attack myself for the horrible person I‚Äôve been, but that only leads to more pain, more setbacks and more avoidance.

9,"After years of listening to my wife tell me about how great Reddit is and begging me to join, I‚Äôve finally caved and decided to make my first post. I hope I don‚Äôt embarrass myself üò¨

Throughout high school, I dated a handful of guys but none of them were ever serious as I was attracted to them but never really would have considered marriage with any of them. During my freshman year of college, I was introduced to a guy who played on the baseball team and I quickly fell in love with him. After three years of dating, he proposed and we wed in a beautiful ceremony at the church both my parents and grandparents had married. We soon welcomed a beautiful baby boy and four years later, another son.

I don‚Äôt want to focus extensively on the falling of our marriage, so I‚Äôll try to keep it short and simple. After having our second son, things became tense. My ex no longer seemed to want the responsibility of being a father to our two young boys. He stayed out late after work and would go straight to sleep upon arriving home. For the sake of our two very young children. I stayed in the marriage for as long as I could. I eventually learned that he was having multiple affairs and came to the conclusion that I needed to get out. 

I was granted sole custody of our boys and we moved back home to be closer to my parents. Occasionally, my parents would force me to go on social outings with friends for the sake of my own sanity. My hometown friends had made lots of new connections since I had left town, so nearly every outing I was meeting new people and making new friends. 

During one of our ‚Äògirls night out‚Äô I was seated next to a very tall woman who I had not met before. We ended up talking nearly the entire night away and I instantly felt a bond between us. I learned that she was a Vice President of a publicly traded company that is run out of our nearest city. I also learned that she was just a year older than me, yet she had never been married and had no children.

We exchanged phone numbers and promised to keep in touch. I figured that I had just made another friendship, but this one felt different. She was so down to earth and didn‚Äôt gossip about others the entire night, which was a breath of fresh air. She seemed like a genuinely good person with a good head on her shoulder and that was exactly the type of person I wanted to befriend during a period where I was already under enough stress. 

We soon started meeting up, just the two of us, and I learned even more about her personal life. She revealed to me that she was gay and had known since she was just eight years old. She had come out of the closet years ago but hadn‚Äôt had a serious relationship since high school. A spouse and kids were something she always wanted, but she felt it may never happen. I consoled her and opened up more about my own struggles over the past few years.

Within just a few months of knowing each other, we became best friends. We did something together nearly every weekend and she would come over to my place after work to play with the kids (who quickly came to adore her) and give me some ‚Äòrest time‚Äô. I somehow didn‚Äôt realize it at the time, but she was trying to make the point that she loved my boys and would do anything to be with me and raise them as her own.

It was during a lunch outing one afternoon that she revealed her feelings towards me. She told me that she didn‚Äôt want it to change our relationship, but felt that it needed to be said that romance was on her mind. I told her that I needed to think about it. Quickly, I saw her facial expression go from nervous to sad. I started to think about everything in my head at that moment. Deep down, I had developed feelings for her as well. It was all just so confusing to me. I had never been into another woman like that and besides her, I could not find another woman ‚Äòattractive‚Äô even if I wanted to. 

I thought about all she had done for me and how great she was with my boys. Looking at her sad face, I grabbed her arm and told her that I wanted to be more than friends. Her expression changed to a mixture of shock and delight. I told her to ask me out. She did and we went on our first date the next evening. 

Things only got better from that point on. Our friends were shocked but beyond ecstatic for us upon hearing the news. She held my hand everywhere we went and always made it a point to declare that I was her girlfriend. I thought it was the cutest thing that she was obsessed with me. That‚Äôs when I realized that we were probably going to get married. I had never had any interest in a woman prior to meeting her and now here I was on the verge of being married to one. 

She proposed on our one year anniversary. We married in the most amazing destination wedding just seven months later. I quickly became pregnant and we welcomed our first daughter ten months after the wedding. Since then, we‚Äôve welcomed two more daughters and I have a fourth in my belly as we speak! 

I must say that I don‚Äôt even see or think about her gender anymore. It‚Äôs all pure love. We are soulmates. It‚Äôs a type of love and emotion I never felt with a guy and sure wouldn‚Äôt ever feel with any other woman. I love her for her and that‚Äôs the most amazing feeling to be in love with someone just purely from the heart. 

It‚Äôs probably a bit cheesy, but it‚Äôs not everyday someone has a story like mine, so I figured I‚Äôd share. I hope this inspired or encouraged at least someone out there. Please feel free to ask me (or my wife) any questions! I‚Äôd love to answer and get to know some of the Reddit community.",05Mar2020,1

12,"I wasn't really born wealthy but as I grew up my family's wealth increased so I started off in public school until 9th grade where my parents sent me to private school. I didn't like it much because I didn't know anyone and I didn't really connect with the kids (i grew up pretty much middle class but going to a ""ghetto"" school), so I begged my parents to let me go back to public school &amp; they let me.

26,"A few months ago my mind was in a pretty dark place. I was depressed and I had voices in my head that would call me names and insults every chance I was alone or I had no one to talk to.

It came to a point where I tried hanging myself in my room one night when the voices were getting too loud.

As I prepped for it, the voices became faint and softer. As I was securing my fate the voices became soothing and inviting. Not irritating and jarring.

But alas, I wasn't successful.

My sister caught me hanging from my room and was able to rescue me.

My parents didn't take this lightly.

My ded beat me up and my sister and mom spouted harsh words at me. Making me want to kill myself even more.

Eventually a few days after that night, my school starts to wonder why I wasn't going to school and asked my mom what happened. She tells them what happened and they required me to get a psychological certificate that I'm mentally fit to go to school. 

My parents decided to bring me to a shrink.

The shrink told us that they'd only give me the certificate if I went to rehab.

And just like that, I was sent off to rehab.

Away from my friends, my family and my boyfriend.

I'll spare you the details of rehab by saying that it was a life changing experience. I learned so much more about whar I had and how I could control my emotions and thoughts.

But yeah. Rehab was fun. I was a changed person after it.

I wasn't completely stable, but I was better.

When I got out of rehab though things took a turn for the worse.

My boyfriend that gave me syphilis (this will be important later) was enjoying the single life while I was in rehab to the point where he wanted to stay that way even though I was back. That meant him seeing other guys from the alter community, a community of predominantly gay men who hide behind a guise of alter egos and interact with sexual intent. Basically, he cheated while I was away for rehab. And he used the alter community to cover it up as something different.

I broke up with him before 2019 ended.

9 months of being co dependent out of the drain.

Let's fast forward to March last week.

I've been unmotivated in studies. I've been lethargic and have been melancholic for the entirety of February up till last week.

My parents had an issue with how I was doing, saying that I do it in purpose and I'm being a complete liability for my family.

They rubbed in my face how much of a leech I've been. Them paying 2k every 10 days for antidepressants. Paying a 100k for rehab. And the costings for getting treated for syphilis that my now ex boyfriend gave me.

My mom told me that I took a huge shortcut in life by trying to kill myself. And she questioned why I wasn't successful in doing so.

That broke me. 

Hearing your mom tell you ""you took a shortcut in life by hanging yourself and you didn't even do it right."" 

Here I am now, having one question ringing in my head everyday since last week.

What if I didn't fail?

What if I did it right?

31,"Hey y‚Äôall, I‚Äôm a new account and I wanted some advice/input on this situation that I am currently in:

So, I‚Äôm currently in grad school, second semester, and a new friend of mine, who is in my program and who I am and will be taking classes with wants me to move into a new apartment with her, just the two of us. Our personalities are similar, and she‚Äôs a nice, sweet person overall. 

We are at a mostly Christian university. I am a bit more conservative than her, but I don‚Äôt feel like this is an issue, really.

So, before I get blasted, because I know this is reddit, let me give a disclaimer: I am a very open person and as long as my space, belongings, privacy and sleep are respected, I am chill to be roommates with whoever. 

However, I feel like there are some differences between our lifestyles that make me feel a bit uncomfortable being her roommate. I don‚Äôt feel like I can completely relax around her, despite her being a genuinely sweet and kind person:

1. She is way more conventionally attractive than me. She is thin, blonde and blue eyed, and is very sexually experienced. I am not. I wouldn‚Äôt normally care at all about any of this, except she‚Äôs made comments about how she is more likely to be kidnapped for sex trafficking than I am because of her looks, and I guess the lack thereof on my part. I didn‚Äôt really take lasting offense at this, but it made me feel odd and a bit judged somehow. 

2. I feel like she is pressuring me to move in with her before I really feel comfortable around her yet. We have gotten lunch a few times, but other than that, we haven‚Äôt really spent time together outside of the school setting. 

3. She has a long distance boyfriend who she talks about quite a bit. She is very open about her sex life (I am not at all a prude and I am open to these discussions, but it is a more private matter to me than it seems to be to her.) She told me that she got herpes during her ‚Äúhoe phase‚Äù in undergrad, and this was maybe the third time I had a conversation with her at all. I am glad that she‚Äôs confident but it took me aback a little. Also, I know that it is almost completely impossible for me to catch it in a non-sexual context but it makes me wonder if I should take any precautions with sharing utensils, washer/dryer, etc with her. I am a virgin (by choice for religious reasons, idk what people do with their own sex lives, but it‚Äôs my personal choice) and I just recently got out of a painful 2 year relationship, so I‚Äôm not super into hearing all about her sex life and boyfriend. I don‚Äôt feel like I know her well enough to tell her that I won‚Äôt want to talk about it; I don‚Äôt want to be off putting or offend her somehow. Lol. 

3. She is well established in her apartment complex; I would be moving into her complex where she is already ‚Äúin charge‚Äù and established there. I would be new to it, and she wants me to Venmo her my half of the rent. I would be ok with this except it feels a bit like she wants to act like she‚Äôs the landlord or something. Maybe I‚Äôm reading way too much into it. Idk. 

4. I just generally feel like I‚Äôm still on guard when being in her presence. Maybe it‚Äôs all in my head and I am just insecure. 

All in all, she is someone I think would be a good fit for me and vice versa, but I want to be on the same ‚Äúwavelength‚Äù and I‚Äôve heard horror stories about friends moving in together, and being roommates destroys the friendship. 

She says she is very quiet, not a partier, doesn‚Äôt want to have loud sex when her boyfriend visits, etc. She also asked me if I was comfortable with having alcohol in the house. We agree on cleanliness standards, noise level, etc and I want to say yes to being roommates because I need a place for the summer/next school year, but I just feel psychologically uncomfortable with it on a level that I can‚Äôt put my finger quite on. 

I don‚Äôt want to feel rushed to make a decision. She texted me asking me if I wanted to come over to see her apartment. I did and we talked for a couple of hours and met her dog. But for some reason, I felt like I was just not quite at ease being around her. 

I have had horrible roommate experiences throughout my college experience and, quite frankly, if I had the money and wasn‚Äôt at risk of extreme loneliness, I would live alone. But it‚Äôs not financially feasible.

I feel like a big part of why she‚Äôs pushing me is because she is struggling financially, which I totally get. That‚Äôs a huge part of why you even live as roommates in the first place. I also feel a bit flattered that she would think of me and ask me to be her roommate. 

I just want some thoughts and general advice here. I‚Äôm so sorry this post is long but I needed to explain it all. 

TL;DR: I feel uncomfortable with an otherwise lovely potential roommate, and I feel she is pressuring me into making the decision to move in with her before I‚Äôm ready. I also don‚Äôt know her that well yet and have had bad roommate experiences in the past.",05Mar2020,1

37,"I‚Äôve been going through a pretty low time lately and this week was especially bad, I came home to a cranky husband who‚Äôs also had a terrible week so it was up to me to cheer myself up. 

So I hunkered down in my bedroom, started to play Outer Wilds, while watching a cheesy Amanda Bynes movie on my phone, all snuggled up in a fuzzy blanket and scented candles lit. 
I decided to take 2 edibles-cause why not crank this night up a notch- and very quickly realized I hadn‚Äôt figured out my snack situation..... literally at that moment my mother in law called to say she‚Äôs stopping by our apartment to see my husband and asked if we wanted McDonald‚Äôs!!
My hubby brought me my food in bed and went out to visit with his mom and I had the best ‚Äúme‚Äù night ever.

You know my job has been getting me down, family issues, feelings of impending doom, self worth is in the toilet ‚ÄîBUT‚Äî there‚Äôs NOTHING a few burgers and ice cream can‚Äôt fix... ESPECIALLY when you‚Äôre blasted into another dimension on probably way too high a dose of edibles.",05Mar2020,1

48,"I used to (and still do) put spare change in bottles. Usually I'd have a cool bottle to put them in. I just stick them on a shelf for display because I liked the way they looked. 

And when a bottle got full and I couldnt put anymore in. Out of boredom I'd empty it out put some in, shake the bottle so the coins would settle more compactly, then stick more coins in, shake it to make them settle  more close together, and do it over and over until I had more room to put more coins in. Sometimes I'd even stack the coins in the bottle. 

Very tedious sounding, but I enjoyed it. I liked to see how many coins I could keep putting in the bottle.

I'm tired of reliving each day. Of contemplating the future and analyzing the past, telling myself what's done in the past is finished and that I can't predict what's to come. 

Having gone through depression, I'm tired of recognizing my own ego and criticizing myself for the things that make me human.

So tired of the popularity of influencers and seeing their self absorbed faces that in the end, I can't really judge anyway. Seeing their popularity makes me feel out of touch with a majority of society. Can't relate at all. I don't find the things important that I feel like I then should. 

So tired of wondering *""What for?""* and then concluding that I should *""just do""* and be.

So many silly coincidences. Good ones. Bad ones. They all happen and cease to surprise me. They feel like a tease, if anything.

Not really depressed anymore. My purpose feels lived throughout the process of time until I end.

The things I feel like I should do, I don't. The ideas seem great but doing them doesn't feel as gratifying.

I don't need a lot of money. Don't need many things. I only need what I have to in order to function as a gear in the system. Since the alternative is foolish.

56,"The past 8 months has been a spiral of crazy occurrences with some new found friends and old relationships. Me and my girlfriend have been together for nearly 9 months, We were a pretty weird but loving couple until shit started to go south. But clearly a lot of imbalances between the two existed from the start. 

Things got worse and she became torture almost. One day, we had a cultural gathering at my house and she invited some of her friends and somehow she started drama against me and everyone had called her out on her shit. Her friends and I became best friends because we all had a problem with my ex. Neither of us considered her really a ""friend"". They just came because they had known that I was going through stuff with her and just to see how things were. We had a butchered celebration because of my ex\[26F\] becomming needlessly emotional and throwing a fit. For the past 8 months shes made mistakes and I just let them slip through my fingers and I kept forgiving her because I was too gullible to not get her love was fake. Including the atrocity that happened at the meetup.

It wasnt until a few weeks later that she played the final card and things got physical to me from her side. I never thought who I thought was my gf assaulting me while I was driving. Wed become too toxic at that point and I had to cut her out for good. 

In the meantime, me adn her friends had started to get really close, one of her girlfriends befriended me really easy because she was going through a similar situation with her ex who she just dumped recently and we both have a lot of similarities in our mistakes. Sometimes she and the others crack jokes and made fun of how I dated such a sleazy girl and all and how bad my rep was falling. Were very close in our sex life as were all friends.

Something about pornhub accounts was brought up in discussion and I had openly mentioned my videos me and my ex made and they were all really shocked. I dont get why it was such surprising to them as we were very serious with each other for 6 months. They were just repelled by the fact I would post online. 

I mentioned that I had deleted it a long time ago and only kept it up for about 2-3 weeks to see what kind of attention it got and that my ex consented to it as well. I know to many it might be wrong and Ive definately come a long way in realizing that but it just doesnt seem that extraordinary to me like theres not a million amateur pornos online. I even blurred the faces and kept our info confidential obviously. They had been telling me that unless I got paid for it that Im a nuisance of a being for that. The girl is more sympathetic with me than the others and tried to stand up a bit and realized it was a minor fuck up and should be given rationaliztion. 

I realize at a different angle it may be very immoral to have your nude body on the internet for others to see and this relationship has taught me a lot and Im making an effort to change for the better myself. I wouldnt dare doing this for attention in my future relationship. Probably not release anything like that at all.

I‚Äôm also really liberal, feminist, etc. I volunteered for the local women‚Äôs support group we have that helps and supports single mothers and young women, domestic abuse victims, rape victims, etc. We give out free period products and try to givenout free brith control pills and other methods sometimes. I also recently really got into zero/low waste and natural all organic stuff, like I changed my laundry detergant or I got a bamboo toothbrush. It‚Äôs all little things I do to try and make the world a better place.

The list goes on and on. If you just pick a single topic like animals for example you have all the issues they face because of humans like habitat destruction, climate change, poaching, illegal animal trade, animal curelty, animal slaughtering, animal testing, etc. All because of us. Humans created so many issues and at times I can‚Äôt help but feel guilty because I am part of that. I pollute. I eat meat. I participate in all this destruction.

I've been here before, and I'll be here again: I haven't slept, I'm starving, everything with my company is two steps forward, 6 steps back...and I have no time for myself or for my sex life.

And it's all my fault, because I'm such a massive fuck up and I can't keep anything under control for, like, five seconds without breaking something or losing something or failing to manage time properly.

I haven't slept proper in days because of my lack of foresight.  And a two second fuck up at work means that now I haven't eaten for over 18 hours.

I'm so angry with myself.

This is how the spiral into suicidal thinking starts, for me.

""You're a fuckup.  You're a loser.  You can't manage your life.  You deserve to be punished.""

I don't even want to eat anymore.  Or sleep.  I don't feel like I even deserve it.  I just want to curl up into a little ball and for everything else to go...somewhere else, where I can't fuck it up.

The urge to self-harm is becoming very loud in my brain.

""I'm a bad boy that deserves to be punished"".  That's what I can't get out of my head right now.

And all of that is to say nothing of my family, or my friends, or my 6 birds that also aren't getting attention.

Or my art.

 I feel like I'm more inclined to think my guts/instincts are on to something because 2 months ago I was sure I was going to get expelled and then I ended up getting expelled (mind you, I didnt study and had no motivation to study but after speaking to an advisor who told me I probably wouldn't get academically dismissed and would be given a second chance only to then end up getting kicked out kind of shocked me). And less than a month ago before getting expelled I had a coworker who got raped/murdered in a parking garage which gave me an existential crisis. 

I have clinical depression, anxiety and iron deficiency anameia which could explain why I feel like this but I can't shake this feeling off of my head. What if it is a sign from god/universe that it's my time to go? I even watched tarot pick a card videos on youtube and all of them said that this month something is coming to an end and even in some of the readings the reader straight out said that someone is going to pass away etc.

Is it possible for people to have strong gut feelings before they die? Are we meant to know when we're going to die? Should I trust tarot readers? I know everyone is scared of death but I literally can't sleep or do anything, I'm scared to get out of my home I've completely lost hope. I just want to survive march.",05Mar2020,1

I'm working two jobs (3-5 depending on how you count delivery apps) on top of school full time.Im always exhausted.  I have to live with my family who suck to be around. My mom constantly says I dont do anything or add value to the house and completely blows off anything I actually do for her or the house. It's never good enough and it's always ""you need to be doing more"" while belittling me for my age, place in life,maturity ect, and then threatening to kick me out whenever I argue back to the point where she's actually forced me out of the house on multiple occasions(still hasn't figured out I have several keys hidden around the place for that reason). And then expect me to stay at the house and be their landlord should they decide to go move to California (presumably with no pay) .I'm under a lot of pressure to finish this semester strong, and praying I get accepted into the colleges I'm applying to. All that while already trying to deal with the insecurity of never being good enough for anyone. I barely have time to do anything that makes me feel good like relax and play video games, or go to the gym. Only solace I have right now is that a local bar has a gaming night

78,"Hi everyone,

So I \[24M\] have been single and virgin for 24 years. I had a long history of poor social skills but I started worrying a lot when I turned 20. I did approach girls of groups I was involved in but it always aborted before even a date could be obtained. Only Tinder gave me the possibility to have a few dates, but they all were inconclusive. I had lost any hope until something strange happened recently.

To sum it up, I started going to events where more women were present and I noticed some unusual interest from different women. I gained hope again that women could possibly be interested in me, even in terms of looks, and during a bar event recently I started chatting with a girl \[22F\]. We seemed to have a very good chemistry. I did not ever believe a girl could stick to me and keep chatting and being interested in me. I took the opportunity : I added her on a messaging app and suggested we drink a beer together, to which she agreed.

So tomorrow I have my first ""natural"" date (meaning outside dating apps) ever. This may sound odd but which advice would you have to a 24 yo male virgin who has been desynchronized from the dating world to the point of joining incel forums and who never had any history of success on dating and sex ?

Also, from my few Tinder dates, I remember not managing to sexualize or start making girls make romantic. Indeed my experience with regards to romantic relationships is completely empty, and it is hard to sexualize when you also have had zero sexual achievement, let alone experience. How do you persuade/convince a girl to be romantically and/or sexually interested in you in such circumstances ?

Thank you very much. This question may sound very odd but I am simply asking for the basics of dating. Really. This is to tell you how far away from romantic success I have been. I do not know if this is my looks, my frame, my personality, my interests, my ""alphaness"" or not, some possible autism, anxiety or mental illness, if I always more lagged behind with regards to dating, or all of these combined. How to get out of my dark cave in such circumstances ?

**tl;dr :** first date outside dating apps for 24 year old virgin man with no romantic experience and hopeless with regards until recently : thoughts ?",05Mar2020,1

6 months, yes 6 months have gone by since i have turned 18,but the only things thats changed is that half my browser history has become legal.I find no new adventure, no new wonder, just the same dreary drudge of human existance.  Still no girlfreind, havent checked that box since age 9, still forget to flush every now and then and lose my stationary every second day but hey mean i get a voters ID, now i can *chose* who can take my money which is all fair and lovely. 
Plus I can drive ! Not that i know how to, but i still have the ""im 18 bitch ,i can drive "" tag.

 Or maybe the dullness, its because im still a student, preoccupied with student things in a student world. Or maybe its exam time. Yes im sure thats it, exam time. That moment where you're aurrounded by all the books you should've read before hand, that moment when you say "" I will be super dooper productive"" and start day dreaming of hitting it big abd marrying Kate Winslet with the only bit of productive behaviour being that half arsed Doodle whiich you feel is rsther decent, but you're freinds(mind you, as productive as you are, yet scorring much higher than you are) say ""dunno jim, looks kinda like a dick"" to which you daftly reply ""but me mum likes it"" only to realise the minefield you have just stepped into.

And then sometimes i close my eyes only to be met by images of Nerst's Equation, Or Meyers Formula or The Carbylamine test, not that i know these things, its just that these names come as a persistant mental reminder that i need to do these soon. Ofcourse i click, remind me later. Come on , the darn government,  isn't efficient, what do you expect me to be !

Im gonna go now abd practice some stuff, by which i mean stare blackly at the wall thinking of cute shorthaired women which chests flatter that a pancake only to realise too late that they're probably lesbian.

She moved away because she failed out of college due to her hedonistic lifestyle of a benzo addiction and dating a campus dealer. She's been through a lot of trauma and she doesn't want to deal with it, so she doesn't. I feel like a have a genuine connection with her but she's so far away, both physically and mentally I really don't know how to deal with it. We talked about our future and how we'd want to make it work but we both need solid foundations before any that can happen(we both 19 with really messy lives rn). In the meantime she's going from tinder boy to tinder boy fucked up beyond belief and telling me all about it. I keep saying I don't know how I should feel about it all but I definitely know how I currently feel and it's just pain at this point.

I saw a neurologist like I said I was going to in my post yesterday - https://old.reddit.com/r/self/comments/fdhtcm/i_26_f_have_an_emergency_appointment_with_a/

I saw a neurologist and she said my previous MRI from 2018 looks normal with no structural abnormalities and said my orthostatic tinnitus and orthostatic headache are caused by migraines. I looked up 'orthostatic migraine' on Google and could not find anything. She prescribed me duloxetine which is an anti depressant and said this will cure me and I'm very skeptical since they said that about the 5 other medications I'm currently on that don't do shit. 

I was discharged.

Will be hopefully seeing my GP again next week since she wants to wean me off some of the drugs I'm already on.

She said a spinal tap to see if my spinal fluid pressure is low is 'unnecessary' and my orthostatic tinnitus and headaches can't be caused by low spinal fluid pressure and she said an upright MRI is also unnecessary and so is an MRI with contrast.

95,"I don't really know where else to post this, or who to say it to, but I'm alive.

 I've been debating ending my own life for months, and I'd finally decided on the when, where, and how. I got off work, drove home, collected my rifle, and left a parcel with several notes for my parents to distribute to my other loved ones afterward. I said goodbye to my cats, which was emotional considering my oldest boy has been with me forever. I'm 23, and he's 19. I love that cat with everything I am. I drove to a lake about twenty minutes from home to ensure that no one I knew would stumble on the mess. I planned on writing one last journal entry, smoking a bowl, and having the grand finale right there in my old truck. It's the only thing that's felt like a constant in my life besides my parents and brother, and in my manic state, I guess it just felt weirdly poetic.

I sat and wrote in my journal for a long time. I tearfully filled up four pages, and placed the journal safely back in my bag. I wrote about everything that's happened over the last several years, how I've struggled with my mental health, how my fianc√© leaving me destroyed me emotionally, how I could barely feel emotion anymore, and didn't know how I could ever feel okay again. I wrote about having to move home because of money, and how I felt like a failure for dropping out of college to work and still winding up back home. I finished the rambling by apologizing - saying how sorry I was to everyone for disappointing them, and how much I loved them, and that I was so, so sorry. I felt like I couldn't handle existing anymore, and I had to have relief.

I slid my old ""Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge"" CD into my radio, packed a bowl, and started smoking. I wanted to go out to my favorite album of all time. The album's not very long, less than an hour, and I figured I'd give it a listen through while I got good and stoned, then I'd finish up. My rifle sat in the floorboard, taunting me, but I was in no rush. There was a weird peace about it. My life was going to end soon, on my terms, and that was okay. That meant that there would be peace soon. I would be at peace soon.

Then my phone rang.

My friend, we'll call her E, was calling me. I should go ahead and mention that I've had a crush on E for close to a year now. I know she doesn't feel the same, and that friendship is as far as our relationship goes, but that's okay. She's one of my best friends, and has been for a long time. I just happen to kind of be in love with her too. I digress.

I picked up and the conversation went sort of (I'm going off of memory) like this:

Me: Hello?

E: Hey, how're you doing today?? (She's usually pretty cheery)

Me: Ah, I'm okay. How about you?

E: I'm okay I guess. I had a really long day. 

Me: Oh, I'm sorry. You should get some rest. Anyway, what's up?

E: Well... I was just going to see if you wanted to come over. I had a long day, and I wanna see you!

Me: Err, eh, maybe. I've kinda got some stuff going on. Can I call you back later?

E: Ughhhhh. Okay, well R (my brother) and N (one of my other best friends) are probably gonna come by later, and everybody would be really disappointed if you didn't.

Me: Okay, well, I'll try my best to get by then.

E: Okay.... I hope everything's okay...

Me: Uh, yeah... It is. I'll see you later, okay?

E: Okay... Please be careful. I love you.

*I was super taken back by that. She's literally only ever said she loves me one other time.*

Me: I uh.. I love you too. I will.


And, with that, I hung up the phone and broke the *fuck* down. Ending my life would be so selfish. I may not love life, but there are people who love me. It would crush my parents, brother, E, and so many other people if I'd gone through with it that night. This was just a week or so ago, and while I'm still pretty unstable and mentally unwell, I've changed my mind. I don't want to kill myself. I don't want to put that kind of pain on my loved ones. I cant do that to them. So, as bad as I want to die, and as miserable as I am, here we are. I'm still alive, saved by a phone call from an unknowing friend. I'd have absolutely gone through with it were it not for her. I can't tell anyone in my day to day life, so I guess I decided to post it here. I needed to get it off my chest. If you made it this far, thanks for reading my rant.",05Mar2020,1
96,"Two days ago I was visiting my family for the first time in a year. I had been traveling for some time and was just generally busy but I know that subconsciously I just avoided seeing them. I have had a difficult past with them but I believe this is only one-sided and they never actually knew that how they treated me in as a child has left a mark that I have difficulty dealing with. I think I might just be oversensitive here but my close friends actually tell me that what I went through is not normal and I tend to downplay it. The issue with me is that I am very apologetic and I always think I am wrong and constantly feel guilty about the smallest things. Sorry for the long intro, here I go:

When I met them it was initially a nice experience. They had cooked and apart from some remarks about my diet it was a really nice dinner. Just to clarify; when I say remarks about my diet it‚Äôs usually about how I eat too much and it‚Äôs bad for the environment and my body, my family is generally quite skinny and they take great pride in not being wasteful and taking care of the environment. I feel like they judge me a bit about my lifestyle. After dinner we sat together and somehow we started talking about the state of the world. When I think back about it, I do feel like I always get trapped into these conversations with them and it was clear again how different my view of the world is compared to them. I am in no way right leaning but I am definitely not anti environment or extreme right wing when it comes to politics. Yet the whole discussion got out of hand with them basically telling me how bad my lifestyle is and how I am leaning too far right (politics). As an example, they believe that I should have a car that is not so polluting (they take public transport). However, I think it‚Äôs a bit over the top to be so judging about me driving a car (I drive a Chevrolet Tahoe) I think that people can drive cars if they like to even if they are big ‚Äúdirty‚Äù cars. This is just one example but the moment I say this they compare me to a bigot and I would probably also vote for Trump etc. (what has that to do with anything??). Next, they poke me a little and just generally start talking about vegetarianism and they ask me if I could be a vegetarian. I tell them I could but I don‚Äôt like it and I don‚Äôt feel healthy if I only eat veggies, I told them I have respect for people that can do this but it‚Äôs not for me. There I went wrong again... Basically, I can‚Äôt be myself around them. I feel like I am being constantly baited only to be proven wrong. After a few of these baits I basically lost my cool and I flipped and told them to stop baiting me and that I really don‚Äôt understand why everything I am doing in my life is so hard for them to understand, I am not evil and they don‚Äôt need to make me feel like that. My sister (one year younger) kinda flipped back at me and basically told me I am an idiot for polluting and she generally considered me racist because I am not emphatic enough towards people in trouble. I walked out after that, I told them they are bullshitting me and I was visibly angry...

The last 10 years I have been working hard on myself to have less ego and making a better life for myself. I hate the grind but I don‚Äôt see how I have another choice (they make fun of me for being a corporate slave). I try to make it as pleasant as I can and I make OK money. I donate to charity (in part because I feel guilty about my luck in life tbh). I really try to reflect on my behavior constantly and see where I go wrong and just generally be a better human and also to let go of some sad experiences I had in the past. I am in no way close to where I want to be, but I try. So after I walked away from my family two days ago, this morning I visited again to apologize for my behavior because I should not have been so angry (I honestly feel that I was wrong), they were happy that I did that and told me not to worry about it and that they know I am a good person and that I can improve to be better. So it should be all good and I should be happy, right?

Well, I am home now but I just feel so sad, it‚Äôs like I am relapsing in a depression that I snapped out of about a year ago... I don‚Äôt want to go there again but I just feel alone and no matter how well I do in life they will never really like me as long as I am myself. I just wanted to write this down and share it because it‚Äôs cathartic. Thank you for reading.",05Mar2020,1

It's just looking at trap camera pictures and identifying the animals that you see, but it's a nice change of pace from what I'm usually staring at all day.  There all sorts of other studies to help out with if you're not interested in animals.  It's basically a way for different studies to get help sorting through huge amounts of data.  Technically I'm wasting time, but I also feel a little bit useful, too.  

I don't work for zooniverse or for any institution that's posted a study, I just really like the website and want to move some traffic over there.",05Mar2020,1

113,"Literally my boss gives me a HUGE task at like 10am but then lunch is at 11 so no right? Said task had a deadline of today which takes a huge time. It‚Äôs pretty much the equivalent of untangling headphones from 5 broken ones but on a computer. 

Then he calls 13 mofos over here so I‚Äôm stuck there trying to help them etc 

Then he‚Äôs like edit this document and make it x y and z",05Mar2020,1
114,"I thought I was doing the right thing. I researched it and every article said it might work. It did. Too well. And then I had to destroy my mistake and the guilt is eating me up. I put him in an environment that I thought was ok. He was smothered in love. However, he didn‚Äôt get a chance to become who he could have been. He didn‚Äôt flourish. He turned mean. I didn‚Äôt know why. I had to protect my family so I destroyed him. I feel Like it was all my fault. No. It IS all my fault. I‚Äôm so sorry.",05Mar2020,1
115,My mom gave it to me. I walk to and from  work and I happened to notice it was gone when I got close to my home. I was playing with it on the walk today so must‚Äôve dropped it then. I went back halfway and looked for it but couldn‚Äôt find it anywhere. It‚Äôs really windy today and there is a sewer grate on my route. I am really sad and feel like an idiot,05Mar2020,1
116,"So it‚Äôs exactly 00:00 when I am writing this and I have been feeling sad. I can‚Äôt write anyone so I decided to clear my heart on here. 
I started to find my true self in 2017 when I realized I am not the person who I used to be. My high school years had so much influence on me that I lost myself. 

I had no talent in anything and I felt like I was useless, that I was just following the system. I used to play football when I was younger but I quit when I went to high school (I really don‚Äôt know why), but after a lot of judgements, people looking down on me and not treating me well (I wasn‚Äôt the most good-looking person as well),  I stopped caring about anything. I had this hunger and fire in me to prove everyone wrong and to be myself. I found my passion for football again and decided I wanted to become a professional footballer and when this all happened I started to isolate myself from everyone, I went out to train on nights whether it was raining or it was cold, I was out there training. To be someone, to leave a mark on this world before I die. I finished high school at 16 years old and now I have dropped out of college for almost 2 years. 
Back in the day I was 15, I am 18 now and I can tell you I made so much progress. I literally went from impossible to possible. 
I started chasing my dreams and I will never  regret that decision, dropping out of school was a big decision but without sacrifice there is no victory. I have a very strict training schedule now where I almost train everyday, 5 times a week gym, 3 times a week swimming and 6 times a week football training. 

I have a very important talent day coming up in april where I hope my dreams will come to reality, I hope that all the hard work will pay off with this big opportunity. 

Sometimes I feel down because I can tell you that the path to success is a lonely one, you have to be willing to sacrifice anything to achieve your goals. The choices I made were difficult but it all brought me where I am today and I know that one day I will be happy that I took this path even though it was full of bumps and bruises. I might not have anyone around me anymore but I am staying strong, I have come a long way and I won‚Äôt give up.

It‚Äôs never too late to chase your dreams or to do what you like, I didn‚Äôt like to end up working in an office, so I started doing what I love. Do what you want, follow your passion. And remember rock bottoms will teach you lessons, mountain tops never will. The wolf on the hill is not as hungry as the wolf climbing the hill.  

It‚Äôs a short life, make the most of it before you regret it. 

I‚Äôm out, thanks for reading üíó",05Mar2020,1
117," I‚Äôve always found myself alone for the most part. I grew up moving a lot so I never really had lifelong friends until I graduated school and went on my own. My friends are like me, they keep to themselves and have a very small circle. Recently I moved to a new place and have been trying to get more socially involved but it seems everyone is jaded or only have time for jobs and their s/o‚Äôs. Or maybe I‚Äôm not someone who these particular people want to hang out with which is also fine by me. Why waste time right? I figured I would try Reddit for making conversation since I‚Äôm pretty deprived of it at the moment. Im not a needy person but I have been chompin at the bit for something that is real. I just can‚Äôt seem to find it anywhere. Maybe the words behind the keyboard are easier to connect with than looks, biases and all the things we are categorized as in this world. If you relate to this, drop a comment and tell me the things you use as an outlet to loneliness and monotonous surface value interactions.",05Mar2020,1
118, most people who meet me for the first time (usually in HS) will call me a fag (usually as a joke but sometimes it sounds more serious). I'm a straight teen but don't know why they do. I'm a pretty passive person also. Any suggestions to avoid this?,05Mar2020,1
119,"I'm a fan of the psychology of behavior and social psychology. It says that we can change depending on our situation and I can see in my life how true that is. I think I am very easily manipulated by my environment for whatever reason. This once I went after work to buy a car because mine broke down on me. I walked in to the dealership a different person than I had ever been. When I walked out with my new truck I was a bit curious but didn't quite understand well at that time anything about social psychology. I walked in with a perception of who I wanted to be in that situation spurred by who knows what. I for some reason perceived myself as this rough, country, dumb, confident, take no shit kind of guy.  Did this attitude come from my idea of what a shopper of cars was supposed to be. Did it come from the way I was dressed right after work at the construction job I worked. Was it a combination of many thing? Yes. It was a combination of many things. We are beings in situations. I am a part of my environment changing it while it is simultaneously changing me. But, something of a true unchanging me seems to also exist. I think that there is a core me that goes mostly unchanged. I don't know this for certain but it is helping me somehow to believe that. I would hate to think there is no true me but the me that exists in whatever situation I'm in. Anybody else know about this stuff?",05Mar2020,1
