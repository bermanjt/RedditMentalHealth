0,"My life is a mess. My parents call me their worst child, i'm not good looking, i'm socially awkward, i have no motivation for schoolwork despite me being naturally intelligent so it is just wasted, no motivation for anything actually except gaming. Even my friends don't like me, or if they do they always have a closer friend, i have no best friend, no person i can come to in times of need. I literally have nothing to live for yet i don't want to kill myself as i want to live, i almost just want to run away to a different country and start over fresh. I know some of these can be fixed and i should just stop feeling bad, but i just can't. I am just done with life. I wish i could just sleep for about 5 years and everyone can forget about me then.

why do i even want to live, i can't even find these reasons myself. And to be honest i don't see doing better in life in years if ever. Just wanna get some help or if not, then at least people who share these feelings with me.",30Nov2020,1
2,"Is it a bad thing that whenever I’m not working I just stay home and watch tv, play video games, or sleep? I don’t ever feel the need to leave my house or go socialize. 

I do, however, work in customer service so my job is me constantly socializing with people (whether it’s a customer or a coworker) about five days a week. 

I’m always exhausted when I come home because I’m introverted (so I’m giving all my energy away socializing) and I’m on my feet for my entire shift. So I don’t want to do anything anyways except lie in my bed and sleep. 

Is that me being lazy? Is that me being depressed? Is it just because I’m an introvert? Im not upset...I’m just apathetic? I guess? I don’t really care about much or find anything worthwhile to do. 

A normal day off for me is just laying around doing nothing, taking care of my dogs, cleaning the kitchen, and making my meals. I used to play video games everyday but I haven’t done that in months. 

I don’t find anything wrong with this but all my other family members always complain about not being able to go anywhere due to COVID or being bored staying at home. My cousins are always going out daily and posting things on social media. My brother usually goes out once a week to socialize with his friends (regardless of covid) and my sister goes out a couple times a month (before covid). 

I guess I kinda feel weird that I don’t have the urge to be social or active compared to everyone around me.",30Nov2020,1
3,"So the last few months have been hell. I've had SO MANY (10+) boils in my genital area, been on 5 antibiotics (started with a UTI, then for the genital folliculitis) and I'm currently 1 week post-op when one of the fuckers decided to turn into a perianal abscess which had to be surgically removed. The whole experience leading up to the surgery has been traumatic to say the least and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. As per NHS hospital protocol, I was swabbed for MRSA on admission. However I didn't receive a result whilt I was there so I assumed I was negative. 2 days post discharge I receive a letter in the post saying I am MRSA positive - SCREAMING!!!!!!?????!!!!! WHAT THE FUCK!!!!!

I had my suspicions bc of these recurrent boils but everyone I mentioned it to brushed it off. Now I know that if I was asymptomatic then MRSA wouldn't be too much of an issue. However I am still getting infected hair follicles all over my legs and I CANNOT have another one turn into an abscess. I'm going to contact my doctor to find out if I can get treatment for MRSA, however I also live with my boyfriend. He's had no issues whatsoever but we've obviously had close contact with sleeping in the same bed etc. So I can only assume he's positive too? If so, would he need to be treated too? I don't know what to do because if I get treatment and he doesn't then I'll probably just get reinfected again and the same issues will start again? ADVICE PLEASE",30Nov2020,1

8,"One of my main core beliefs on life is that when people make mistakes they can learn from them and get a second chance and learn from it. What I hate though is when they do it again. It's like the saying fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. I seem to always give people the benefit of the doubt. But I am tired of seeming like the only person around my inner circle of life who when fucks up tries to improve and grow from the mistake. 

Since covid hit I took it as a time to sell wallow and pity and hate everything. But after a few months of sitting around being a lard ass my birthday hits and I get my camaro. I can finally leave the house and go be free and cruise around. My car is one of the only few things that make me happy. Since I have got the car I lost 30+ lbs. Become a genuinely nicer person. Less cynical. Improved confidence. But the people around me are still the same shit for the most part. I tried to improve myself and I know I have a long way to go still but I've done so much when nobody around me ever tries to improve themselves. One they either dont see/refuse to recognize the problem. Two they genuinely just suck and enjoy it.

My elderly father is a great example of refuse to recognize any problems. It has always been do as I say not as I do. I just have such a distain for him he is just so horrible at some points in how he emotionally acts putting me down or just getting angry out of no where. 

My ""friend"" who is somewhat a narcissist enjoys to watch things burn. I had another post today with his involvement. More or less he likes to see me fail. Sets me up to fail, with his advice. Crushes my confidence with a single sentence. He feeds off of my suffering and is honestly half right with the stuff he says.

I just hate how my past is how people see me. I used to be such a major asshole. I have improved so much since the beginning of hs it being my senior year. But I just do not seem to fit in anywhere. Im somewhat fine with it but it just sucks that everyone just things of me as that mean fat guy.

What's a life hack that seems really bad but is actually very good?

My reply:  

Acquiring a physical health problem when you're already disabled for mental health reasons. It legitimizes to people that you really are totally disabled from work and may need special assistance to do the normal everyday things people can do by themselves. When the disability millstone is permanently around your neck, becoming physically ill legitimizes your disability in other people's eyes the way a mental health diagnosis simply doesn't.

(As of 2018 I have kidney failure, and as of this year I need regular hemodialysis. For the previous 14 years I had only a mental health diagnosis. During that time I tried to find a place to live and kept having landlords reject me because of the mental health diagnosis, until I lied to a landord that I had a physical illness. She was herself diagnosed with a physical disability but had the average Nazi bigotry toward mental health diagnoses. Melanie Smith of Scarborough, Canada, here's looking at you.)",30Nov2020,1
16,"The old approach was: ""Let a thousand guilty go free rather than have one innocent wrongfully convicted.""  That approach has clearly failed.  It hasn't even avoided having the innocent wrongfully convicted, but far worse, it has caused wrongfulness to flourish and human evil to be treated like a badge of honour.  It's time for the opposite approach: ""Let a thousand innocent suffer that one guilty may be justly punished.""  If that one guilty gets away with it, the thousand who were innocent will turn guilty right along with him.

The narrative of Sodom and Gomorrah illustrates what I'm saying here.  In those two cities the truly wicked were maybe 15% of the population.  Another 80% were passive bystanders who tolerated wickedness in others, and a brave 5% opposed wickedness but failed to deal with it.  All 100% were equally punished because there would have been no way to punish the wicked without punishing all, even the good hearts whose failure let wickedness flourish.  So Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed entire.  We have to start giving thought to destroying entire the dens of wrongfulness in our human world.

My metaphor of cancer treatment for dens of wrongfulness comes from chemotherapy and radiation poisoning healthy tissue in order to ensure that cancer will not return to it.  Doctors are highly familiar with this extreme-seeming approach and can attest to its great rate of success.  It's time we started using that approach everywhere it's warranted.  And if millions of passive observers and valiant fighters in our cause must perish in the process, that can't be helped.  There is no other approach left to us to try.",30Nov2020,1

I manually bike everywhere, I'm a minimalist, and I am reading everyday, I listen/watch to a lot of content (like Jordan Peterson), and I know I want a relationship. I work at a gas station.

I'm having grave difficulty finding any projects or hobbies that drive me. I've tried instruments, writing, archery, cooking, swimming, hiking, sports, drawing, gardening. Nothing is gripping in the slightest. Schooling isn't a goal as I learn online and read (I can't try DND until Covid is over).

I'm open and creative, but lacking a good follow through on anything as engages me. Learning and cycling aren't enough. I need to do something, but I'm having a hell of a time finding anything to pursue.

25,"I am 23 years old. My entire life I never had any friends to hang out with outside of school or work. I never had anyone from school to hang out with after school or on the weekends. I did interact with people in school, but not outside of school. I was just a school friend.

This has carried with me from my childhood all the way to my adulthood. When I was in college, I would meet people in a given semester in my classes, but after the class ended the relationship ended. I no longer had classes with those people and because of that we lost contact.

At work, I interact with my coworkers but I don't see them or talk to them outside of work. I'm pretty sure once I get another job I probably won't keep in contact with them.

This pattern has been occurring my entire life with all of my relationships. I meet people in school or work, I only interact with them in that setting not outside of it, and once I move on from that setting or vice versa I never speak to them again.

I want to strengthen my relationships. I want to make and keep friends. I meet people I like and click with, but then I end up losing contact with them.

31,"At least once a month I get into these long episodes of depresion and self-awareness of how alone I am. I can feel so lonely I'm almost in pain. There's a constant pulling ache in my chest that nothing fills. I feel like I'm drowning. My mind is never at rest when I realize my loneliness. 

I struggle to make friends and talk to people because of my social anxiety and speech impediment. I can barely speak sometimes because I can't get words out. Most of the time I get talked over or ignored. So at work and anywhere else I've learned to be silent and stay out of people's way.

For the past two years I've struggled with masturbation and fantasizing about situations I will never be in. Things so normal yet out of reach like being hugged or caressed. I imagine what it must feel like to be able to feel another person's warmth. How safe it might feel to sleep on someone's chest. I make up all kinds of scenes in my head of being loved and wanted. 

I'm surprised at how sexual I am. As socially awkward and strange as I am, I feel like my sexuality is one of the only things that make me normal, somehow. It reminds me of my ever so present need to feel loved and cherished. But it's off-limits until I'm married, which I doubt will ever happen. Yet like the apple that tempted Eve, I'm drawn to it. 

I'm a Christian and feel incredibly guilty and ashamed for my fantasies. But not all of my fantasies are sexual. Some are really sweet. I like to imagine I have a boyfriend who picks me up and takes me to get ice-cream and then the lake to sit at the dock and snuggle. Or I'll pretend he brushes my hair and holds me until I fall asleep.

I have social anxiety but I am glad it's not as bad as it could be, when it counts I can brave through it and talk to people and socialize, but I just never belong anywhere.

The last time I remember having friends was 4 years ago, after that it's just been people I've been on good terms with like classmates and I've had opportunities to be good friends with people after that but I just never do, i never text them or make plans and all that which leads to those opportunities going away.

and most of the time I am quite comfortable with the life I have chosen for myself but then there are some days when I feel jealous of people who have close friendships and all that. 

I stopped making any efforts to have any friendships or relationships, I am 19 and i don't have any Facebook or snapchat or insta or all that, i mean i do have accounts on everything but i don't use anything because when I do i see people having a better time than me and it bums me out.

34,"Inventing titles is much more fun than settling comfortably down into an uncomfortable chair and writing a post. Nevertheless, to abandon the latter in favor of the former is to abandon all hope of retaining my humanity. And, as Reddit is so keen to remind us, we must remember the human.

I still remember the first time. It was a balmy summer day, nothing at all on my mind except the infinite layers of silence of which our world consists. Despite the quiet, there were the faintest echoes of sound which had their origin in the death of a previous silence. Bouncing around inside my head like BBs in a tin can. They were familiar sounds, yet unrecognizable. We all know this feeling: there is a knowing, but this knowing is enveloped in a cloud of obscurity. In the words of the ponderous apostle, we see in a glass dimly. To give a somewhat more sinister turn to the metaphor, we hear whispers from beyond the dark treeline. 

While strolling along the edges of this treeline, the numinous gasps cloaked in that shadow absconded by time suddenly coalesced into a resounding voice, or something analogous to a voice anyhow. A voice is a human sound, and these, shall we call them shades of tone, were decidedly not human. Not anti-human, mind you, but certainly a-human. Homology sans homo. Nevertheless, the chorus of these tones reverberated into a string of notes, and the notes in turn were cloaked in dark raiment which approximated meaning to my heat-addled mind. The meaning took the form of a question which I had never asked, a question which responded to an unspoken rule that had been marred or misplaced by some careless scribe. In terms of a dialogue, it went something like this:

""Remember the human""

""Which (witch?) human?""

It's difficult to believe that such a short piece of nonsense could have stirred up so much controversy, but nevertheless here we are.

So, how to decipher this dialogue?

As with all language, there is of course a certain insoluble ambiguity which must be ignored. Let's start by determining to ignore that ambiguity so we can move on to ignoring the rest. Now in the first place, we must consider the first part of the dialogue, initiated by Reddit itself. However, before we can get to that we must first deal with another unstated problem which will be resolved according to its unstated nature. Thus the problem by its very nonexistence solves itself. 

The second problem is based on a fact, which is based on an observation. Now, everyone knows that an observation consists of perception + realization. However, some of the critics from the Antarctic school have argued cogently that this formula is based on an artificial construction of reality which assumes its own trustworthiness. As such they posit that observation is an unbreakable monad which is both perception and realization in the same essence. Unfortunately this idea has not caught on, in part due to the tragic but humorous coincidence which cut short the life of this school of thought's progenitor. Heinrich Wirmann was the possessor of a noble mind, and his efforts to found the Antarctica Center for Sapiential Ignominy gained him the admiration of his peers in Europe and the Americas. Unfortunately, while engaged in a heated discussion with a colleague about whether Don Quixote was ""just doing it ironically"", Dr. Wirmann, never fully aware of his expressive gesticulation, knocked over a stack of books which started a chain reaction which culminated in a replica windmill on an uppermost shelf falling and, eventually, tragically, lodging itself firmly in his own skull. Ending his life. Thus a complete explanation of Wirmann's theory of observation was never completed and his ideas were cremated along with the rest of his unspoken thoughts and the remnants of bones scattered across the frozen desert. Nevertheless, some of his colleagues have attempted to reconstruct his theories based on some obscure scratchings found above the leftmost urinal at Observation Point C, which his friends fondly recall was one of his frequent haunts.

Regardless, these academic disputes have little to do with the content of the observation. At the time of the revelation I had not so much as heard of Reddit, nor ever considered the possibility of the rule which forms the opening salvo of our dialogue. The observation, therefore, is ""uncanny,"" although leading Youngian analists who were contacted did mumble something or other about a ""connective unconscious"" which might shed some light on how this rule which I would have no access to otherwise could have manifested in my mind and subsequently responded to by the ravenous void. 

Focusing on the letters which the revelation itself is built out of, there is not much new here, although the lack of punctuation was disturbing to some researchers. By way of an overview, a careful analysis reveals several consonants intermittently separated by vowels or spaces. Researchers are split regarding the number of words which make up this first part of the dialogue. Jenkins et al (2019) in their statistical meta-analysis showed that just over half of the researchers in the extant literature believed there are three words: ""remember,"" ""the,"" and ""human."" On the other hand, a slightly large portion of scholars found themselves in the opposing camp, asserting that there were in fact two words in this revelation, and that the subject (revelatee) is to be blamed for the subsequent confusion; the two words being ""rememberth"" and ""e-human"", where ""rememberth"" is of course a jumbled misunderstanding of the word ""remembered."" The implications of this blunder, if demonstrated to be veridical, are chilling. The most surprising result of Jenkins' study is that neither school seemed to be familiar, or even aware, of the research conducted by those who held the opposite view. Jenkins et al in their comprehensive study only found one scholar who deviated from either of the two opinions on this subject. The meta-analysis cites Scott Howard's unpublished article ""Much Ado About Nothing: Reflections on the Nightmare of (Un-)Knowing"" where he remarked bluntly that he had ""no idea what the hell \[you\] people are talking about."" Touche.

The second half of the dialogue is equally perplexing, and the fact that the question remains unanswered even in over 15 years of studious contemplation has led Richie (2018) to remark cynically: ""As painful as it may be to speak such sentiments out loud, I think deep down we all realize that our attempts to solve this problem have been a huge waste of time."" Cynicism always seems fashionable at the time, but Richie's statement seems unwarranted. Even if the question itself in the final analysis is revealed to be entirely nonsensical and devoid of content, the process through which we seek to understand it leads to the finding of truths about ourselves and about our world.",30Nov2020,1

Bernini started sculpting as a young child and was recognized for his talent at [8 years old](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gian_Lorenzo_Bernini). We've learned a lot about child development and psychology since then - It is healthy and positive for a person to have a well-rounded education from 5-20 or so and then figure themselves out. 

Sure, Bernini was an amazing sculptor at 23, but at that point he had been sculpting for 15+ years. Comparing yourself to someone who lived that kind of life is not only nonsense, but leads only to feelings of frustration and self-doubt. Most people will never be the next Bernini, but most people have the potential (with the right training and practice) to become a master of a skill. If you are one year in or even haven't started at what you want to do, it is very easy to compare yourself to experts and feel shitty. 

Even the more satirical ""When my parents were 25 they were having kids, me at 25"" memes are similarly defeating. Congratulations, your parents or grandparents decided they wanted to have kids at (what is now considered) a relatively early age. Ask anyone who wasn't born into wealth, and they will tell you how hard it was to afford diapers and baby food, and how challenging it was for them to raise their kids. If you're NOT ready for that struggle at the age you are now, that is 100% okay. 

Considering the increasingly high rates of ""diseases of despair,"" such as depression and addiction, I just want you to know and understand: take care of yourself and your mind first. The average age of a redditor is 23 years old, it is not healthy to put pressure on yourself to be perfect right now. If a family and children is in your future, it is very likely you will be far better prepared at 30 or 35 than you are now.

hi fellow reddit users. i'm almost 2 years clean. honestly it's been a real struggle for me lately. last month i had the worst anxiety attack i've had in the past 2 years (the last really bad one was may 2018). today i had another one, not as bad but i felt sick to my stomach. lately i've been feeling sick, i haven't been eating or at least not as much as i should be. maybe 1 meal a day, at most. i have to force myself to eat but it makes me feel sick doing so. i've been doing really good and i wanna keep doing well, but it's getting really hard. i feel like a lot of things are my fault (my friends sometimes blame me for the pettiest things and when i try to explain that i can't control it, they say im immature and make me feel invalid) and i don't know what to do in order to fix it. i've made some really good friends but i don't know what to do with the ones that make me feel like shit. i want to get a job and move out but the jobs i'm technically certified for are jobs that need experience i don't have. i just don't know what to do anymore. my depression is taking over me.

is there any advice or even just kind words that might help?",30Nov2020,1
51,"The stromboli I had for dinner was mediocre, which surprised me because that pizza place is almost never mediocre. I've also noticed that I can't eat as much as I used to before - I barely finished half of it before I was full.

The rest of the night? Uneventful so far - played some games and lurked in a couple of Discord server voice channels just for shiggles and of course entertainment. Can't go for my walk due to rain - it hasn't started yet but I'd rather not get caught out in it. It wouldn't be as much of a problem in warmer weather, but now it's just not ideal, heh heh.

Until next time.",30Nov2020,1
52,"My apartment was broken into about 4 nights ago when I wasn’t here. Just some coins were stolen. I live on the first floor of a studio apartment, the complex is pretty open. I’ve always been scared to sleep alone and I often will get scared and have to fall asleep with the things on. 

But now, I don’t know how I’ll ever sleep normally here again. I’m so scared every night when I get in bed. Every little noise sets me on edge and sometimes I just lay here and cry because I’m so scared. I hate that someone was able to take away my entire sense of security and safety in my own apartment for a few bucks. I wish there was a way to go back.",30Nov2020,1
53,"I am just 18 years old, but I have made so many positive strides in my life this past week. I started out on sunday by leaving school to come home for thanksgiving. Nothing too eventful happened between the time I got home and all of monday. Tuesday night changed my entire perspective on life. I was sitting in the smoking section with one of my friends, had a cig in my right hand after taking 2 grams of mushrooms and thought to myself ""what the fuck is wrong with me."" My friends and I were all tripping balls that night and I was the only one who experienced that. After I was done tripping, I realized multiple things about myself. For starters, I realized that I need to quit nicotine, and I'm going on 4 days without any vapes or cigarettes. I also realized I need to stop drinking on the weekdays and only will drink on friday and saturday nights from now on. The final and most important thing I realized was that I needed to learn to let go. Today I worked up the courage to block someone who I only associate with pain and sadness on everything. As soon as I did that I felt a huge weight lifted off my shoulders. I'm so happy I learned all this about myself and how I can make myself better. I haven't felt this great about anything for a while. I'm really thankful for the shitty trip I had that night cause I would still be doing shit to destroy myself if I never did it.",30Nov2020,1

56,"I used to be a slightly overweight fortnite nerd. I used to spend 10 hours a day practicing for fortnite tournaments and just eating unhealthy junk to keep me awake.  People started commenting on how i was gaining weight and getting uglier.   


Mot people would cry about it, but i realised that i was the problem. It was my fault that i decided to eat shit and not exercise. Heres how i fixed it:  


About 10 months ago i weighed 82 kg. I started eating healthy and after half a year i was down to 70 kg. I was now just a bit better than the average kid, but that wasn't enough for me. I therefore started going to the gym 4 months ago.  I am natural, and i've gained back those 12 kilograms i lost, but in muscle. I have a full 6 pack, which girls love obviously. Ever since i got this amazing body, girls have wanted me left and right. Lost virginity like a month ago.   


Trust me, girls looove muscles. Litereally the last nude i got was yesterday, and i didn't have to show anything other than my upper body. If you just exercise extreamly hard. Your entire life will change. More testosterone, higher sex drive. More people will be attracted to you, and even your face will change.

57,"Since I'm locked in my house because of the situation we are in, I've started to work on myself. I've always been an anxious, shy and introverted person, and I started wondering what kind of person do I want to be? 

But then, inevitably, I though about the usual ""be yourself"" thing everyone tells me ever since you know when, so I asked myself a question: ""Where does the real me begin?""

I've always wanted to be the extoverted person who can talk to anyone and loves going out, I think everyone wanted that at some point. But at the same time I feel like that wouldn't be the real me. I like being by myself, I'm usually relaxed and calm, and I'm...fine with that, I guess?

But at the same time I wish I could be more, you know? I'd love to talk more, hang out at least once a month, overcome my very, very silly fears.

I know I can be both, but I think it would be draining to me, because, as I said, I'm introverted, I need to recharge.

58,"I'm disgusted with how I've become. Sad, lonely, anxious, and a shell of my former self.

I'm disgusted with how much I procrastinate (I'm doing it right now!), and how little I seem to care about now. Every day it feels like I'm burnt out, so I don't even know why I keep going.

I'm disgusted with how little sense of direction I have with my life. *Carpe diem*, they always say. The only thing I'm seizing right now is a fistful of student loans. I'm always such a coward. I don't take any risks at all, I stay in my lane. I'm going to end up with many regrets in 40 years now, I can see it. I keep on delaying my happiness, thinking that if I just complete my degree, I'll be happy. I know it's all bullshit. I don't have an end goal in mind. If I died tomorrow, I wouldn't die a happy person.

I'm disgusted with my social life. COVID has made me coop up into one room for weeks and weeks on end. And entering first year uni has been the most isolating thing. All my High school friends are doing their own thing now. Cool. I wake up and stare at a medium screen for 10 hours and then go to sleep. If I am fortunate, I get to scroll through the small screen, or maybe look at the big screen. They say that life has no meaning without meaningful relationships. That seems true. The most interaction I get is getting validated by Reddit karma.

I'm disgusted with how pessimistic I am. My life feels like a long, dark tunnel with no end in sight. It's supposed to get better, but that hasn't been the case for a good while now.

But most of all, I'm disgusted that I'm not going to do anything at all to change any of this. Just needed a little place to rant, sorry.",30Nov2020,1
59,"It would be so easy. I could probably go to some dude's house tonight if I wanted. I know how guys are.

The problem is, that's not really what I would want. I know I would feel disgusted with myself afterwards. It wouldn't lead to anything meaningful, which is what I really want. It would also pretty much kill any chance I have of ever ending up with a woman. Of course, I'm not having much success with them now. Maybe that's why I'm even considering this in the first place. At least it would be something.

Another complication would be that it would ruin my relationship with a lot of my family if they ever knew I had done something with a guy. I've got multiple family members who I know would stop talking to me if they even knew I was attracted to men. I consider my relationship with my family more important than my carnal desires.

This shit sucks. I wish talking to women was easier. I wish confidence and social competency weren't big deals as a dude in the dating world. Then, to top it off, I can't even indulge in my sexuality because it would just make things worse. It makes you feel this combination of frustration, loneliness, and shame.",30Nov2020,1

68,"Ok heres a description of the weordest dream i can remember

So for some reason me and ginny weasley use a spell to enter what i now think was a promotional colouring book from a supermarket(?) and at first things are normal and nothing bad is happening, we are in a gymnasium and things slowly get more creepy and we find out that the book has some murderous characters and we need to survive(?) We use spells and shit to kill some of the things, all look like they're from one of those kids ride's props, imagine those dr seuss rides where you just pass through some scenario that looks like a cartoon, its like that. We go through some of them.

One of them that i remember is one where you're a candy(??) Being passed on the register things get progressively creepy as the cashier loses her eyes(??) and the end credits is three of the employes saying goodbye to the client while one of them had bandages covering her eyes and they sing this weird song about it.

Another ""level"" that i remember is one of those from children's websites where you gotta put specific topping on something as its passing through, but you haver to float surviving a giant cat,(since the perspective is that you're a candie going throigh the register, again) trying to snatch you

Other stuff i cant remember happens and in the end of this whole shit the mascot of the supermarket shows up and the one of the employes shoots it as its behind us, we get out off the book and get to the train from hogwarts to back home. 

Theres a post credit(???) Scene where the train passes through a street with a hurse with a guy with a hole in his eye and he gets up in a sitting position as we are passing through


So my understanding of the plot of my dream is that theres this cursed supermarket that is bringing harm to its employes, a cursed mascot is there or something, and the employes had enough at the end and tried to get rid of what was causing(???) All of it


I swear to god i didnt use drugs, i literally just woke up and wrote this. This was the end of my dream but was the weirdest so i decided to post here",30Nov2020,1

Who knows maybe someday we will effectively conquer natural death and have lifespans measured in centuries.

Adult life just seems to be a conveyor belt of anxiety about money and fear of losing everything you do have - and my life is better than most. I have a good job and can't imagine how people raise kids on the median income in the US. We have averaged about two hospital visits per year (various things &amp; child birth). I can pay the bills but despite our income we have consistently had about $3-10k of medical debt for the past 5 years (its zero interest so you take the payment plan even if you have the $ in the bank).

I keep thinking, is this is as good as it gets? It probably is, and it still kindof sucks. I love my son and I keep thinking, ""what did I do bringing him into this situation?""

I don't like living by someone else's standards. 

I left a couple of dishes in the sink last night, and you know what? The earth didn't fucking end. I put them in the dishwasher this morning and nothing exploded. Imagine that.

Little shit like that really pisses some people off, because they feel like I'm ""leaving it for them to clean up"".

Yeah, because I'm over here scheming ""oh, this plate and fork in the sink will really piss them off"".

I don't like feeling constantly pressured to keep everything 100% clean all the time just because someone else requires that standard of living.

I'm not ""leaving it for you"", you're just a neat freak that needs to chill the fuck out.

Now I'm living on my own again, I'm doing 100% of the house work, and I get to do it on my terms. 

From my perspective, and maybe I'm just really unlucky in my partners, but it just feels like from my experience that this is just how people are.

TLDR: I'd rather live by myself and do all the house work on my terms than live by someone else's standards of living and feel constantly pressured to perform to their standards or else be nagged when I forget one plate ""you left that for me to clean up?!""",30Nov2020,1
86,"I use this ""If, then"" mindset quite often and it puts momentum to where I want to go and what I want to do. This can be a food for thought to some who struggles with taking action.

I discovered this when I was having this self-help stage in my life and I didn't find an easy explanation to this at the time. I only discovered this after reading tons of self help books and watching tons in youtube as well.

I created a simple blueprint for me to follow whenever I want something. It is the ""If, then"" mindset

So a great example of this is with a simple sentence:

- I want to start working out, but I don't have the time.
- I want to make art but I am too exhausted.
- I want a camera but I have no money

Here is how to change that with the ""if, then"" rule:

-If I want to start working out, then I have to find a suitable schedule to do it.

-If I want to make art, then I have to figure out how to avoid exhausting myself.

-If I want to buy a camera, then I have to start budgeting to save from my daily allowance.

&gt;The formula is:
&gt;If I want to (goal), then I have to (simple solution you can start right away then gradually progress)

It is a matter of finding the right question, to find the best answer. It can serve as a pathway or a guide to your goal rather than a full solution. A good practice is after asking this, you can start searching for the things you need to do to reach your goals:


&gt;The solution is I need to find suitable schedule for workout, then start to try working out in morning.
if it wont fit then try lunch time tomorrow... Not again? Try night time... Not again?! Try weekends... (And so on)


This is a simple trick that I use to control my mind's belief of what is possible and what is not. It helps to give your mind a habit of thinking for solutions rather than thinking of excuses. It doesn't give you the solution at the first few times but the more you do it, the better answers you will get. 

This formula can be useful to many things, The only thing to be cautious about this rule is to be careful with the questions you ask. It is important to choose wisely, and also to keep on asking and searching for the best answer. 

I hope you guys got something from this, It is hard to master at first if you are used to excuses but you will get there :)",30Nov2020,1

88,"Hi all, I’m a 17 year old African American guy (this become relevant in like, a few sentences) who is very happy and thankful and grateful for all I have. My family definitely on the lower end of the class spectrum. 

Every time I’m browsing the internet and seeing these other people in their larger houses and born into more fortunate situations I sense a feeling of hatred within myself and I don’t like it at all. I am normally not that type of person at all and don’t know where this is coming from. 

Another thing besides finances is white women specifically. I’m pretty sure this has come from being in the BPT echo chamber too long and now every time I see a white woman one of my first thoughts will be “she has life so much easier than me” and just other rude thoughts.

Could this be from me not liking the situation I’m in (at the point where I am with my family, I’m going to college and will never step foot in this house again) and it manifesting??

91,"So for a short summary, I basically feel like whenever I see something and like it, I immediately get scared and quickly try to forget about it, because if I like it, it’s bad and ugly, or lame.It could be food, clothes, books, accessories, anything.I’m not “allowed” to like them, buy them, say their name out loud to the cashier, oh god, even thinking about that terrifies me.

I’m scared that someone I know would be there and see me buy it, or say it.I’m scared they’ll associate it with me, even though the things I like are nothing weird or dangerous.

I absolutely hate when someone tries to take a picture of me, because I look terrible on camera.And not just on phone cameras.I look hideous on professional ones too, completely different from the mirror, (which I like).I feel like I’m not worthy and “whole” enough to be in pictures, and when my mom tries to take one of me I get really scared and hide my face.

I see other people, and my friends buying things, with seemingly no problem, ordering food, admitting to liking something, sharing the music they listen to with others, and overall just knowing how to be a normal person (and I know that most people have no idea and just fake it, but the things is, I can’t even do that because I’m so scared of everything), and I just look at them, and be so jealous that they do all these things so easily (even if they only fake it).

I can’t do any of those things.I get so scared whenever I have to go into a store, I try not to look at anything for too long because I’m scared people will think I like something, even tho I know nobody cares.I’m also scared of meeting someone I know.

And now comes the reason...my older sister.I’m sure that she’s mostly the reason I’m like this.
She was toxic my whole life, and still is.I liked something while growing up?Bad.Ugly.Lame.She liked something?It’s the best.The only one whose opinion was valid in our house was her.She was always this smart, loud, outspoken child and I thought she was God or some shit.She is only 1 and a half years older than me, but I still followed her all the time.I always agreed to her opinions, never tried to defy her, seeked her approval all the time, always tried to please her.I was terrified of her.

If you didn’t agree with her while we were kids, she yelled.And it wasn’t just a childish fit.She sounded like an adult, at least in my eyes.An all knowing adult, whose opinion mattered more than our parents’.And whenever she yelled, I felt like I was paralyzed in fear.

Of couse, when she yelled, my parents yelled at her too, and then everyone was yelling, except me.

She always tried to control my life, and after a few things that I liked, and she didn’t approve of them, my child brain was like “oh wait, I get it now, I can only like things that she likes too, otherwise they’re bad!”.

(By the way, she was also nice to me a lot of times, so like, she acted like a controlling mother towards me)

It went on for years, and when I was like 12, she was at her worst stage.She was 14, always angry, always starting fights with me and my parents.At these times, she called me stupid a lot and genuinely thought I was dumb.One time, I ordered a video game online and when my dad asked which site I ordered it from, and if it was safe (it was), my sister remarked, “it was probably a reallly bad site because she is SO stupid!”And I still remember how bad it made me feel, that she, the person I looked up to and seeked her approval, said something like this.It might not seem like a big deal to others, but it was to me.I’m super sensitive and pretty much everything slightly insulting hurts me, and stays with me for years.

She is still controlling, but doesn’t insult me anyomore, in fact she always tells me how cute and beautiful I am, and that I’m allowed to have things I like, but I don’t believer her.Just because she says this now, doesn’t erase the past.A year ago, her, our mom and I went shopping, I said I liked a shoe, and she was like that’s atrocious.I had a really bad feeling in my chest after that all day, I almost cried.

Last summer I was listening to music in my room with earphones (like always, because listening to it without them is my worst nightmare) and she suddenly came into my room so I got scared and hid my phone.She noticed this and said, “what are you hiding?You know what, I never got to hear what music you like.Can you show me one?”I said no, I don’t want to.She kept begging me to show her just one song.I kept saying no.She started saying things like if I don’t show her, that means I don’t love her and don’t wanna share things with her.I told her it wasn’t the case, I’m just scared to show people what I listen to (especially her).

She was like, “now’s the time you become strong!SHOW ME ONE!If you don’t, I’ll tell mom about your bad grades.”

So basically, I was stuck between exposing my music taste to my sister, or having another huge family fight about my horrible grades.I’d like to add, standing up for myself wasn’t an option bc my sister never takes it seriously, it just doesn’t work like that with her.

So, both options were absolutely terrible for me and I started to feel overwhelmed, which lead to sobbing.She started to yell at me to stop crying, because I look like I have to choose between my mom and dad’s life.So come on, show me that music or I’ll tell mom your grades.You have 10 seconds.I kept crying, but slowly started to type in the song that I felt like was the safest option.
She said she really liked it, but I still felt terrible, and I still can’t show songs I like to other people, so her little plan to make me stronger didn’t work, she just put me through something really stressful.Again I say, this seems like nothing to others, but it felt really bad.

So yeah, this is basically it...it became really long so thanks if anyone reads it.",30Nov2020,1

95,"Every time we witness an injustice and do not act, we train our character to be passive in its presence and thereby eventually lose all ability to defend ourselves and those we love. In a modern economy it is impossible to seal oneself off from injustice.

If we have brains or courage, then we are blessed and called on not to frit these qualities away, standing agape at the ideas of others, winning pissing contests, improving the efficiencies of the neocorporate state, or immersing ourselves in obscuranta, but rather to prove the vigor of our talents against the strongest opponents of love we can find.

If we can only live once, then let it be a daring adventure that draws on all our powers. Let it be with similar types whos hearts and heads we may be proud of. Let our grandchildren delight to find the start of our stories in their ears but the endings all around in their wandering eyes.

The whole universe or the structure that perceives it is a worthy opponent, but try as I may I can not escape the sound of suffering. Perhaps as an old man I will take great comfort in pottering around in a lab and gently talking to students in the summer evening and will accept suffering with insouciance. But not now; men in their prime, if they have convictions are tasked to act on them.

96,"Ok so this is in the discovery phase right now but I have a startup idea and it seems almost too good to be true, like why has nobody ever thought of it? Moralizing not allowed, but let me know if it sounds good when it comes to making money.

Basically we sell a covid-free experience. We partner with influencers and post that there’s gonna be a really cool 3 week long party in a mansion with a pool and they’re paying for room, food, the whole experience. We are also going to say it’s exclusive so you can only join if you’re hot and have a certain number of followers etc. reality show meets vacation I guess.

For safety well partner with a covid testing place but secretly mark up like 3x and roll it into the “experience” package.

Then, a week before the party is set to begin (it’s all prepaid) tell them someone in the group has broken their Covid quarantine (to be clear, we are making this up) and we can only afford to give them a partial refund because we placed non-refundable deposits on the venue. What they don’t know is that we actually didn’t put deposits down on anything because there was never going to be a party.

Now of course the question is how do we scale this? The answer is to then offer those people bigger refunds if they promise to post a few non-descript photos from “the party” and encourage their followers to go to the next party. Anyone involved will sign an NDA from the get go so it’s pretty airtight. Debit and ACH only. 

From a business perspective, how effective is this idea?",30Nov2020,1
99,"It must have been early 2019 maybe 2018 but my schools drama club did this thing called festival where a bunch of schools would come to one place and put on shows. Judges would decide who moved on to the next round and so forth. It was really nice, we had lunch and dinner together and before the winners were announced we’d have a dance and whatnot. Our school won the first round and went on to states I think, doesn’t matter too much.

The next leg of this tournament was going to take 2 days and it was super far away so all 15 or so of us had to stay the night in a small hotel. We had 3 rooms, 1 for the adults and 2 for the students. I had 2 options, stay with a group of like 8 sorta druggie people, or stay with the girls. I was friends with most of them and they invited me so I stayed with the girls. I slept on the floor with couch cushions as my bed. It was a fun night though we did face masks and stuff, great time.

When the next day came we went through the day and it came to the dance. A friend of mine who I liked at the time and who was very shy randomly took my hand and pulled me onto the dance floor and we danced all god damn night.

Then finally it was time to see who won. We ended up winning and I won an award for tech stuff. Then when we were packing up, the girl from earlier came up to me and hugged me without a word. I still regret not hugging back but I was very surprised in the moment.

That prolly made very little sense but I wanted to write it down somewhere. Have a great day!",30Nov2020,1

117,"Some time ago I was taking a trip for work, and I decided to enjoy my lunch break at a large local park. I love being outside, because I love nature. 

Now, I am used to jackdaws coming closer when I have lunch, though they always keep their social distance. Cool guys. They want my food, but they know that they also are food if they are not careful, so they stay away and politely ask.

Ravens are different. And I did not know, because I never met a raven. 

Until that day. 

I was enjoying my sandwich, and this raven came up to me. Walking. Not flying. Not hopping. Walking. That was the first warning I ignored. He knew he was superior to me in both abilities and intellect, and he was confident enough to not flaunt his superiority. 

The second warning was imminent. The caw. 

He stood there in front of me. Not keeping his six feet social distancing at all. He made sure to caw from five feet away. He made it a point that he was not scared of me. I was inferior, and I did not know it. At the time I had yet to realize that this was not just a big jackdaw, and I would soon find out that this creature was just as demonic as my cats. 

I ignored both warnings that my food was his. That was my mistake. It leaped and landed gracefully next to me on the bench. Which is cool, I like animals, and animals like me. Some like me for attention, some like me as food, and others like me to stay very far away (looking at you, Billy, you could have just asked instead of resorting to a bite in my arm).

Ravens are different. To him I was not a friend, not a foe, and not a food. I was the plate that held his food, and with one quick strike that would make a pro boxer jealous, he jabbed his beak towards my hands and flew off. I just screamed. If you ever read of some kind of soundwave that almost knocked the ISS out of orbit, you will know that my vocal cords were the culprits.

I calmed, took a few deep breaths and realized...

All was fine until the sadist in me became alive again, I had strong urges to play mind games with her. Sometimes act normal and sometimes act like I hated her. She asked me why I was acting off every now and then but my response would always be ""I'm acting off?"". I noticed that it started to effect her more as time went on, things such as trying to be nicer to me, occasionally she'd be really depressed amongst other things. I loved it. I got off to the idea that I was causing pain to this girl which liked me and that I liked back. I wanted more, I loved the idea of hating her for no reason and causing her pain. Surprisingly, she never stopped talking to me. She still liked me so much, even more than before. One day she asked me why I hated her. I acted like I didn't hate her, but I didn't exactly try make her feel that she has value.

You give a group of people a simple option between two things, let's say a movie to watch or a restaurant to eat at, and ask them to vote.

They think they are being accommodating and easy to work with but in reality they're making things more difficult, not easier. If everybody says ""I'm good with either!"" then there is no result to the ""election"" and the person trying to organize things just gets annoyed and ends up having to make the decision themselves. 

So when someone who is generous enough to be organizing something for your group asks you to vote on two options, just make a fucking decision, even if you don't care, just say something. Chances are the person doing the organizing doesn't really care either they just need a fucking answer from everyone so the decision can be made quickly and democratically.

I (26M) lost my job, had to leave the country I’ve lived for the past 8 years and move back to my home country and broke up with my GF of 2 years which honestly was traumatizing the way it went down. My life has turned upside down with sleepless nights of anxiety and depression. 

Unfortunately, my mom is having it worse. She has Stage 3 cervix cancer, she had a radical hysterectomy and now would need chemo and radiation but the overall prognosis is good as most of the metastasized lymph nodes have been removed. Initially it was considered early stage but during the surgery they noticed spread to the lymph nodes. What’s worse is that the day before her surgery her own mom (my grandma) passed away. After surgery she learned the cancer is more serious with chemo and radiation after (initial diagnosis was that no further treatment would be required)

Add to that my dad just went through 2 lithotripsy procedures as well.

She’s recovered from her surgery and will start chemo soon and After her 12 day stay in the hospital I’ve spent a lot of time with her and I’m glad I’m back home to be with her. Unfortunately I’m not handling my own life shit well at all. I can’t sleep I’m anxious and then in the day when I’m supposed to prepare for Grad school apps I’m too exhausted. 

I know my mother needs my support and I really want to be there for her. But I just don’t know how. I don’t have the strength, in fact I want to lean on her with all that I’m dealing with the breakup (it’s hella messy and fucked up)

I have some expensive stuff in my room that if broken would deeply upset me (instruments, computer, etc). So I slammed my door shut and thought to myself that I might as well take my anger out on that since it's something I can fairly easily replace. So I used both of my hands and threw them at the top of the door the hardest I could. Made a hole that literally went through the door.

I've never been more aware of the anger and hatred I have towards myself ever in my life before. And it's not like I can just be mad at 2020 for the shitty stuff it's thrown at me because every fuck-up is always my fault and I can never do anything right.

The other day I couldn't get a thing to work in these programs I was using on my computer. It got to me so much that I literally ripped out the USB port on my digital piano which was something I used almost everyday and was something I enjoyed.

135,"Normally dreams jump around and don’t follow any coherent structure. This was strange as this time my dream showed a coherent chronological plot of a Taiwanese TV show called “Ancient Stone”. When I woke up this show doesn’t exist anywhere. 
For the first 40 minutes it talked of how people from 4 different backgrounds and lifestyles meet up as friends and reminisce the hard life they had growing up being bullied and assaulted by the neighbourhoods and wealthy people around them. So majority of story is flashback. Throughout the dream they were also trying to keep something away from those people like laying down their life to protect it perhaps and ancient stone? 
The dream is strange in the sense that it felt like “depression-punk”. It was constantly nighttime and there wasn’t a lot of people around. It was a small coastal Taiwanese town in which everyone knew it each other and most non-rich people were United against the wealthy residents of the town. The captain of a boat was an old man who brought it with his life savings and allowed the four boys to spend time on it and learn about the sea. 
Each episode was grim, gritty and dark but “cool” as in borderline badass. The four boys would do anything to fight the injustice they endured in their lifetime. There was a total of 15 episodes of this show and I managed to watched up to 5 episodes of this imaginary tale. 
At this point as a struggling writer I might have some content I feel confident in. I saw the scene, the characters, the movements and emotions portrayed throughout this drama. It was beautiful like this story wanted to be written. 
So as a budding screenwriter I might adapt this in some way after brushing up on the little details.

136,"I'm 24, and I feel like I never will. I hate apartments so much. I still haven't rented one because I fear them, the amount of strangers around and that the landlord has the key scare me (I grew up in a family of narcissists who got off on being controlling and authoritarian, everything you'd find in an abusive relationship) I haven't even gone to college because I'm afraid of being in debt for the rest of my life.

The statistic that even middle class people of my generation will likely never owning a home is on my 'reasons to kms' list.",30Nov2020,1
137,"The last several weeks I've been working 60+ hours (the last two weeks being 70+). The extra money has been nice. But I've been neglecting a lot of housework. Really not sure how I've been having people over with the place looking like this.

I might be using work as a means to not being alone all the time. I've lost a lot this year and work has been the only thing keeping me going. I have a lot going on.right now but I have no desire to reach out to anyone. I'm slowly starting to accept I'm okay with social isolation. I'm nothing special and I have nothing to offer people.

138,"I think it’s damaging to propagate the idea that you should be ashamed for not being happy and wanting out in an otherwise happy relationship.

 For example, if they’re a good person, have a job, are loving, and seemingly tick all of the right boxes-you’re shamed for wanting something else. It seems like unless they’re abusive, an addict, a dead bedroom, or an all around horrible person you get no support. Telling someone they should appreciate what they have makes them internalize that they’ll never have better or they’re a fool for giving up a “good one”-when there are other people out there that will also treat you well and that you’ll ultimately be satisfied with. 

If you’re in a relationship, feeling loved and considered and helped when needed should be a given. Common decency should be a given, it shouldn’t make someone a unicorn. 

I realize every relationship has ups and downs and it is possible to work through feelings of doubt and make it out happier, but sometimes everything is great and seems right, but it’s still not right for you.",30Nov2020,1
