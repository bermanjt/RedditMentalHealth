0,"What the fuck do you do when you left high school for an entire year and at the beginning of that year when you first left people invited you to hang out but you always refused to, and after the year you decide you’re ready to hang out with people again but now nobody wants to hang out with you, and they’ve stopped inviting you.",06Aug2020,1
1,"We had been dating for almost two years, but never had sex because she is Muslim and wanted us both to save ourselves for marriage. About a week before our two years anniversary she broke up with me because I wasn't ""the one"".

I was really struggling from the breakup because I love her, so I took my time griefing and had no interest in seeing anyone else. Apparently she felt differently. She started talking to this group of guys, got the birth control pill prescribed, got them and herself tested, shaved her pussy for them upon their request (something she wouldn't do for me) and then had basically an orgy with them that lasted a whole weekend. Parts of it apparently got filmed by one of them.

Now she contacted me out of nowhere and admitted everything. She said she regrets it deeply and should have never broken up with me in the first place. She wants to get back with me and stay with me.

I'm not sure what to do.",06Aug2020,1
2,"I’m a young guy and went to my job adviser of one month she had chose me forward for a job interview. and she asked me do I need interview clothes ( polite/bubbly tone of voice) i said ‘no thanks iv got all that’ and her response was ""oh, have you got all that? (Bubbly Tone of voice as I said) and then she said ‘ ok well do you know how to conduct yourself on an interview"" while looking at me pleasantly with furrows eyebrows , (see I’m very shy and quiet) I said ‘yes’ she went on to say (she used her hands as gestures in motion to what she was saying) ""ok, well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes....make sure you get a shave. make sure you cut your nails. make sure you do you're hair up all nice and that"" (in a voice between a mix of bubbly and assertive) then she paused a bit looking at her computer and then said ""and make sure you put some aftershave on as well, for the girls make sure it's men's"" then she burst out laughing. I just smiled with it. She said it nicely judging by a laugh at the end but idk. i wasn't near clean shaven at the time of the appointment tbh) but always was previous appointments. she sent me an email the next day about it saying about what I need to take with me to the interview and at the bottom it had underlined ‘please dress smartly’ and ‘good luck’

4,"Male) aged 30) 6ft tall) 160-163lbs) I’m naturally an ectomorph (tall and slim) (but now I have skinny fat vibes) 

6 months ago my face got larger looking mainly around the cheeks and middle of face) and made me look skinnier as it was then out of proportion to my skinny fat  body (I have a severe pot belly too) but it went larger too. as I gained weight from 11.1 stone to 11.10 stone. 

Recently I went down to 11.3 again and jogged  but hardly any difference definitely but looks larger too. as I want and I still have the pot belly and larger sized  head and my body seems larger overall too. . It’s difficult to get below 11.3 stone even with fasting tbh so that’s the threshold. 

◾️Black pants I wore a few months ago for work seem tighter and my legs look more longitudinal in them around the bottom half of legs. 

See Iv been jogging most nights in my garden and fasting mostly too and it’s made me drop on the scale but can’t see a difference) I try eating between 6-8pm and that’s it.  I was a few lbs more in 2018 and look thinner and thinner faced and clothes fitted better. 


◾️I’m down to 11.2 now  and my face looks larger than ever and I was a lot thinner faced  when I was last that weight in 2018 so I don’t get why /:

5,"Lately I've been highly romanticizing the idea of turning off the tv and putting away my phone and computer in lieu of becoming a monk for a day and meditating for hours on end.

I can't even properly meditate on my own for more than 10 minutes without using the Headspace app. 

I just have it in my head that somehow by looking inward (the place in which I spend waaay too much time already) and being ~zen~ I'll be able to work through everything I perceive to be wrong with my life and myself.

I don't even picture myself meditating on anything in particular, but rather just keeping a blank mind all day; logically I don't see how that would help me either. Surely I would need to meditate on gratitude or work through issues or something.

Maybe as I already lose myself daily in tv, social media and video games, and am just 45 days off of constantly losing myself in weed, I'm just trying to disguise more avoidance and dissociation with something I can convince myself is a mentally healthy practice.",06Aug2020,1
6,"I have a very confusing nature. At one end i criticise people when they post about their life, what they were doing, what happened today. I feel they are just attention seekers.

On the other hand i feel very alone and i want that attention to people.
I have constant thoughts as to ""why am i like this?"". I basically have no friends,it is not that i am afraid to talk or share my thoughts. It is just I don't know where and whom to talk. Who will listen to me

7,"I have known him since kindergarten and even back then, he would always ask me to give him my stuff and if I didn’t he would threaten to stop being friends with me. I stopped being friends with him from 3rd to 5th grade. Once middle school came, he became friends with me again. My other friends and him always came to me for rides because my parents were the only ones who would drive us places.

Once high school came and everyone got their license, he pretty much never asked me to do anything or talked to me. Then after high school, all of his friends went away for college so he started inviting me places again. Then when they come back for the summer, I receive no invites at all. It’s literally like clockwork, as soon as the semester ends, he doesn’t invite me anywhere until college starts back up again.

I told him that if he’s really my friend then would he would invite me to his house or parties when he has them, but he just calls me “crazy” or delusional” even though I have proof of it.

A few weeks ago was his birthday and he had a huge party at a Lake House and invited everyone he knew except me. Also, this week he and bunch of his other friends went on vacation to the beach which he knew I wanted to go. In fact, he told me I was welcomed to come, but when I said yes, he never responded. And a couple of weeks ago he told me they weren’t going to the beach because nobody could go.

I just feel like my life is missing huge chunks like traveling internationally, not knowing where my next adventure will take me in life, etc. I used to have a much more adventurous spirit until I went to college and then I went into full adult mode and now I feel like I missed out on those opportunities to live freely.

9,"I’ve been so happy lately. I’ve made many changes in my life the past few months. I just quit my job which I hated and now have a job that is the same pay and I love it. I have found a few new hobbies like golf and running. I’m not the greatest golfer but I’m glad I started playing, it’s very fun. I have so many new PS4 games to play in my free time that will keep me occupied for awhile. I have enough money put off to the side now for the ps5 when it comes out. My girlfriend of 1 year and 3 months and I have found new hobbies together like bonfires, watching sunsets, and golf as well. I just wanted to say that if you put your mind to it and make things happen, you will like the outcome.

10,"Okay so I'm 24 and I have worked on costumer service before but it was a... well, easy job. I could leave every 2 hours to grab a coffee, it was a calm job when no costumers were in the store, I could be on the computer doing whatever most of the times as long as I stopped when a costumer came in, stuff like that. The only downpart was that it was in a secluded area with no windows, that kind of sucked and made the whole thing much more tiring.

Anyway, now I've finally finished my course and I'm on an internship for 7.5-8 hours per day. No breaks, no computer, I actually have to sit for 8 hours and actually have something to show for it. And I'm adapting amazingly well, I'm loving it.

I was a bit worried. In college, when I stopped working in order to go to class, I got used to read books or study personal stuff most of my free time, and I wouldn't really be that productive and I would always end up spending 3-4 hours per day on random youtube videos. Then my classmates who were already enrolled in internships kept telling me how they arrived home at 6pm completely exhausted and not feeling like doing anything else. I was scared the same would happen to me.

Not really. I think I'm being pretty productive at my internship. Being surroundered by older people (everyone there is at least 35+, married, with children) kind of sucks and I'm not the most extroverted guy naturally, especially when I feel I can't really connect over anything. So communicating with the other workers has been... well it hasn't been anything lol I barely talk to them other than ask for help, say that I'm done, and wishing them a good morning/afternoon. Which is unfortunate because I think if I got along better with them I had a chance of actually getting a job there once the internship ends, but the way it's been going they won't accept me into the team, and I wouldn't feel comfortable either.

And yet I'm still full of energy when I get home. Whereas before I would have the whole day to myself, get distracted constantly, and not do anything productive for more than 2 hour tops (if I was lucky), maybe, spread out throughout the day, now I get home at 6pm, still full of energy to dedicate to my hobbies. It's been 3 weeks and I'm able to get home, study (when I say ""study"" I mean studying video editing and programming which are areas that attract me even though I'm graduating in law), go grab a coffee, get home, study a bit more. I'm sleeping 5-6 hours per day and studying my hobbies at least 2-3 hours now, which isn't much but... you know... you do what you can. Then I can make it to 4+ hours on the weekend. My concentration ability has also improved. Before I thought reading 30 pages of a technical book in a row was boring so I would stop every 10 pages, do somethin else, read another 10 pages. Now I'm capable of forcing myself to keep reading and taking notes while still absorbing information. It depends though, if I'm getting really bored with it then I will still do frequent pauses.

I have no clue how having 8 hours taken away from my me (this time without having the freedom to miss classes or do random breaks or being distracted) got me so much more productive. The only problem I'm having is getting to work on time. It starts at 9am and 2pm, I can't get there before 9:15am and 2:15pm. The earlier I wake up, the more stuff happens, I have no idea how this works. I've just settled for staying 5-15 minutes overtime at the end of the morning and afternoon to somewhat make up for it.",06Aug2020,1

Savings portfolio booming, future looking bright.  Then Covid hit.  One by one it all went bad.  Savings vanished, couldn’t find new job, had to move in with parents because no income, find job and am miserable in it, girlfriend breaks up with me, resign job to go work on self care and health and do cross country trip, total car in accident getting flowers to brighten my day after several weeks of hard depression, parents want me gone, have no friends in city my parents are in and haven’t been able to get a hold of friends from my previous city since I left.

I was cheated on in all my past relationships. Every time I like guys, they may show initial interest but always end up choosing someone else. It’s destroyed my self esteem over the years. I have so much anger and resentment. I hate how guys always prefer other women to me. I hate how other women always get treated better than I do. I’m sick of always being someone they want to hook up with, but not someone they take seriously. I’m sick of always seeing someone I like find a gf after meeting em, and end up caring for her more than me.

17,"This is my first post! (22f) I mainly just wanted to write and blab, maybe make a fool of myself. I find myself in a hard situation I somehow always manage to create. I've been struggling with depression and (severe) anxiety for about as long as I can remember now - whether thats past trauma or a chemical imbalance i'm not quit sure. I have been in and out of therapy, currently out due to not having any insurance. 

I quit my job last week. Almost every job I manage to get I end up leaving at some point. I showed up, and I had a panic attack in the parking lot, got in the car and left. I couldn't bring myself to speak with my supervisor as they had humiliated me in front of my coworkers before and I wasn't prepared for it to happen yet again. Every time I begin to make progress with something, another part of me somehow manages to sabotage it. I was doing good - I hadn't been late, hadn't called in, was managing my anxiety pretty well and was even starting to be more social. 

I often try to pinpoint exactly what causes me to make these decisions, trying to figure out what I can do to make myself a functioning part of society. Every time I really think about it, I get far too confused and my brain just seems to roll everything up into one giant ball. I've gotten to the point where I no longer have any social media beyond this account I just made, have no job, dropped out of college, no friends and spend most of my time worrying. 

With no support system, a toxic environment and a brain that works against me I find it hard to pick myself up. The only thing that has even kept me alive at this point is the possibility of accomplishing my dreams - becoming a success in the field I hope to be in one day. How do I get therapy/meds without insurance? How do I get back into college? How do I make friends? How do I keep a job with severe anxiety? Where do I start first?",06Aug2020,1
18,"TL,DR Costume party, I dressed as a pimp and him (my roommate) as a hooker. He looked like a real girl. At the party, he sat on my lap, his head on my chest, hugging me. I caressed his butts under the skirt and he didn't react. Nothing more than this. My most beautiful memory, even more than actual sex. The only time I was attracted to a male, also.

I'm a straight man, married with children. Living in a small, conservative town, almost everyone is White (me and my wife too)and looks down on minorities and gays (mostly rude jokes among locals, nothing serious). I don't think this way, but sometimes pretending to because it helps to be part of the group. I know, it's completely wrong, however it wouldn't be a good idea to fight them and remaining alone. My post isn't about this, however.

Even now my best memory is about a costume party during college, I was an international student in the US for 6 months, far away from home (I'm European) and judgements. To make it clear, no crazy life but I'd a couple experiences (completely normal there but somewhat controversial here) I told only to my closest friends (a short relationship with a black girl and a night doing cocaine and MDMA). But I'd another experience I've always kept hidden from anyone, especially what I felt and still feel when remembering that. Only told a friend about a fake, similar experience (not my male roommate but an european girl I just met there), not finding the courage to tell him the truth.

My roommate was also an international student and not very good at speaking English, like me. He was from Taiwan. Good relationship, he was a fun guy. Both straight, never been sexual tension between us.

Except when we're at a costume party, gone there together. I dressed as a pimp and him as a hooker. I swear he looked like a real girl, a very attractive girl in a revealing outfit (at least to me, but even to many other guys, judging by their stares and ""approaches""). We danced together for a short time, I realized I was attracted to him but pretended I wasn't, only joked about it. A drunk guy began to harass him so we decided to leave the dance floor and we went to sit in a chair.

We already had few drinks. I made him sit on my lap, caressing his legs and hips ""but only because we must play our roles"" (an excuse). After few minutes he put his head on my chest and hugged me, I boldly tried to put a hand on his butts under the skirt, he didn't react. With my other hand I played with his long, beautiful hair (only a wig, though). We remained like this for 20 minutes or so, then he asked to return to our place, I reluctantly agreed. Nothing more happened after that, I secretly hoped to do something more but I wasn't brave enough to ask or try anything.

Even now, the short time a guy sat on my lap is the best memory I have about this kind of things, even better than actual sex experiences.",06Aug2020,1
20,"...and I'm not sure if I like it. I lost my job recently, so I've had a lot of free time and time to think. I spend a lot of time in my head/thoughts nowadays. It's made me appreciative of the finite nature of life, but also has given me an existential crisis thinking of the same thing. 

My losing my job, and my job coming to even slower halt, has made me less obsessive over the person I'm pining after, but has also removed a lot of the romance and light-hearted, lovey feelings because the rush isn't there anymore, and this lockdown has brought of depressive/abrupt feelings to surface. It's a sad realisation. I've come to the conclusion that everyone is the same, but different in their own ways, and that no one is perfect. I wish I thought he were perfect still, even for just a little while. 
 
I was moving away from my hard-stance atheism, just before I lost my job, which was also exacerbated by his belief in god. He believes in god, and he's a good person, so god must be real. Now, since I've lost my livelihood, I'm online a lot more. I'm applying to jobs more, on reddit more, reading the news a lot more. No longer do I go out as much as I did before- I don't see the need for breaks, nor do I think I deserve them, or they're a waste of time, in a sense, until I ""get a job"" and am sorted.

So there are more screens. I read more sad stories; the explosion in Beirut, kids getting cancer. And my hard-stance atheism slowly returns as does my contempt for corruption and all the tragedies in the world. 

My adoration of him slowly drifts away the more time we spend apart. The thought of him is more cemented in reality now, or is just this way because we haven't seen each other in so long? I'm forgetting what his voice sounds like. Slowly forgetting his facial features. No, I do remember his eyes- so blue, so beautiful...I could swim in them.

I'm sad, but not too much, I was used to being single for most of my life before he came along. I was quite content in life, if not sexually frustrated and repressed, and he relieved a lot of that for me. He was the first to show me, to teach me. The frustration was a bit like a huge burden or wall preventing me from emotionally moving forward in life. Or have I just reached the age of maturity, so am more calm and rational now? I don't think about sex now nearly as much as before I met him. 

I suppose with the loss of the fast-paced lifestyle we were all so used to, the pressure to adhere to many things that society pushes onto us is gone as well. Or maybe it's just the increased introspection and depressive feelings.",06Aug2020,1

24,"I’m really pissed rn, so I apologize for any/every spelling error, grammatical error, or formatting errors made in this post

Why do girls keep using me? It’s a legitimate good question I have that I know will never be answered. 

For a little context, I happen to be what a lot of people would describe as attractive, and for this reason, female attention with me is a little weird.

I recently got cheated on (found out a week ago) , but I decided not to put much mind to it. what happened, happened, and I just need to keep my head up and just pay it no mind.

I made the dumb decision with my other female friend that I would agree to being “friends with benefits”, if you know what that means. 
She was the one who brought up the idea, and I actually wasn’t sure that I wanted to go through with it, but i was hurting still so I went with it. 

Today she was sending me stuff (if yk, yk) without me asking or mentioning anything and I told her that I’d be home in a bit and for her to wait a little. 
Fast forward an hour later, I told her I’m ready and she proceeds to block me and say rhat she doesn’t want to be responsible for someone when thier horny

Let’s back up a bit

The exact words she came to me with, just days ago was 

“I don’t see me liking you in any other way then sexually, and it’s kinda bothering Me”

So I said, “hahah, it’s all good, if you wanna just stop talking we can, I don’t wanna bore you or waste time” 
But then she said she wants to do this and that , blah blah blah

So now we’re at today

I’m pissed the fuck off because I can’t figure out what I did wrong today

Sorry for the rant

So I get home,",06Aug2020,1
25,"Correction: As I am writing this, yesterday was in fact my birthday.

Everything happened as usual, getting the ""Happy Birthday"" text messages over all the social media apps I use. Going out with my family to get a birthday cake and a gift for myself. Just standard birthday things. Usually, this would be one of the happiest days of the year. But, this year was totally different. I mean I wasn't a completely broken man, but I just felt a lot of sadness and disappointment in myself for where I am.

Always as a kid, I was/am the big dreamer kind. I had big plans to change the future, to be a somebody (Side Note: The mindset ""If you haven't made your mark, that means you're a nobody."" is a very toxic one). I thought by now at age 19 (almost 20!). I would've done something. Anything worthwhile. I mean maybe not flying over to a different country to build schools for sick children but at least at the start of something big. 

I know it sounds childish. Not everybody gets to be ""somebody"", to do make such a big impact that the whole world would echo.

I'm just disappointed in what I have done up till now. 

Even if I recall my \*somewhat\* 20 years of life as fun things I did as a kid and the mistakes that made me who I am today. From my first memory that I can recall to this very moment where I try to make words appear in front of a screen. Nothing in those 20 years has made a huge impact on the dream area of my life.

What scares me, even more, is, taking my current country average age for a male's death is 81 years. That means I have 62 more years left to live, and that's if I'm lucky! I don't want to be questioning what I want to do with my life for 3x longer than I have. 

Maybe I'm just having a lot of death-related anxiety? I'm not really sure, cause on paper 62 sounds like A LOT of years. But, I mean does it really? If these 20 went by that fast, who's to say that the others go by just as fast or even faster?

Hopefully, somebody can relate to this, just know...you're not alone. 

TLDR: I can sum it up as, ""I don't want to die without being great.""",06Aug2020,1

27,"Hi. Idk if this is the group to post in but, I recently signed a lease on a room in a house which I will be moving into at the end of August. It’s a beautiful place in a safe area, but the downside is that you aren’t able to pick your own roommates.

at the time, this was ideal since I am moving into a new city and don’t know anyone. However, I have recently found out that both of my roommates are men. I am 5’0” girl and relatively pretty. I was sexually assaulted a few years ago so now I constantly have a fear of having it happen to me again in general, let alone living with two random men. I feel so incredibly stupid for not even thinking of this possibility when I signed the lease, but it’s too late to reconsider now. I don’t know what I should do. I guess I’m just looking for advice on what I could do to protect myself or maybe just overall thoughts?

29,"I'm not sure where to post this, but I would like advice or to hear people who have been through a similar situations and honestly to just get this off my chest. I guess I'll also put a trigger warning if your sensitive to suicide and sexual assault and abuse. 

Back in the summer of 2018, I was home from college and was living with my parents. My parents more specifically my mom and I have always had a bad relationship, she was always verbally abusive growing up and that summer the verbal abuse was really bad. I have anxiety and during that summer I also switched anxiety meds in hopes I would be less spacey. I became depressed that summer; I think it was a perfect storm of sorts from the combination of being told I was an absolute burden to others and my new anxiety med.

My depression became really bad, I started self harming and everyday I felt like I would be better off dead, the thoughts of killing myself were constant. I just saw myself as worthless, a failure, and a burden to others. These thoughts caused me to isolate from my friends. I just completely stopped communicating with them and just stayed at home because I felt like if I hung out with them I would be bothering them and I also felt like why would they want to hang out with me. 

I eventually reached out to my family for support, which they did offer. I eventually switched anxiety meds in November, and that helped. I was no longer sad and depressed, but at the same time I didn't feel anything, I felt numb in a way. 

A side effect of the anxiety med is weight gain, which I was excited for because I've always been underweight. I was maybe 90 pounds and 5'4"" and I put on 20 pounds in roughly 2 months. My mom after I gained the weight started to call me fat and said I need liposuction in certain areas and even to this today (I'm still at 110 pounds) she says these things. 

Anyways during the spring semester of 2019, I'm slowly talking and rereaching out to friends and trying to make new friends. I still felt numb for a while, it was a challenge to push myself socially and to try to feel normal again. 

Half way through the spring semester I was sexually assaulted and then raped by a stranger and I kid you not a week before it happened I thought to myself I was finally feel like me again. I was resent into a deep depression after that and some PTSD from the event. 

This all happened my sophomore year of college and now I'm gonna be a senior. I'm functioning and normal for the most part, but I'm now quite pessimistic and I'm not sure how to change my outlook and become more optimistic. Before my sophomore year I used to be optimistic and kind of naive to a fault where I felt like everyone was good and nothing bad happens, and now I'm the polar opposite. 

I'm typing this now because I feel and my parents feel that my negative outlook on life isn't healthy. I'm going to be a senior and I'm thinking about job prospects, research opportunities, and I honestly feel like there's no way I'm going to be successful, in my brain, I think realistically the bad outcome is going to happen to me because why wouldn't it. I just can't fathom actually something working out for me and it just feels too unrealistic. 

I guess another layer to this I feel like I don't have a lot of confidence anymore, I always feel very inept compared to others. I think my sophomore year, especially that spring semester, my GPA really took a hit which also contributes to me feeling like I'm not going to be successful. I also think socially after my sophomore year, nothing was the same and I was never able to get things back to how things were with my old friend group. I've made new friends, but I can't help feeling sad and that I ruined and missed out on some friendships. 

Sorry that was long, I just wanted to make sure I had good context and background. I would love to hear from former pessimists how you were able to change your mindset and became more optimistic.",06Aug2020,1

32,"I(22M) feel like some people might say I'm bullshitting here and I wouldn't blame you but I have never felt the physical withdrawals of any type of drug. The only things that have ever affected me physically are cigarettes and caffeine. Of course I'm not proud of it but I've done heroin, meth, ecstasy, shrooms, cocaine, crack, weed, Adderall, and many different kinds of pills, also those computer duster cans if you want to count that. I've done all these drugs, except for shrooms, for months or a year at most and today marks one year since I've been on meth although I will take 2 week long breaks so I don't become too addicted. I've seen people that have been doing a drug as long as I have experience pain, stomach issues, anxiety, the urge to do more, and other terrible feelings. I, however, have never experienced these issues.

Although I do experience mental withdrawals, I'll crave more drugs but it's only thoughts for me, unlike my friends where they can't sit still, their hand shake or they're fingers are always moving and tapping. After I've come down off a drug, I'll have thoughts of wanting more but if I ignore it for a couple of hours and find something to do, I no longer think of it and I can continue my days sober. When I quit heroin, I didn't have to struggle or detox, I just decided to stop and I haven't been bothered by it since the day I quit, it seemed way too easy compared to what I've heard and seen when people try to quit.

I've searched the internet but I only find articles about alcohol, I haven't met anyone else that doesn't have withdrawals, and I can't think of any reason why I don't feel withdrawals. Obviously I think it's a good thing and I'm not complaining, but I just want to know why?

34,"Hello everyone. This is a throw away account.

Im posting here just to let it out. I dont have many friends I can talk to except my parents or my girlfriend.

A little background:

So I started working at this company 2 years ago as a software developer.We are a team of 3 people. More than a year ago we got told to extend our software we use here. It was a pretty big project to begin with. We had to touch the core of the software any many other things at the same time.

Because we dont have any professional supervisor we had noone to coordinate the project. The communication in this company is generally bad.We got no real list which features were needed or which people we could ask.So it was all on us.

Since it is a selfmade software we had to analyse this programm first. Trust me, it is a mess.

So we ""finished"" the project with still many requests open. At this time corona started so we had to move the release some month further. So now we are in June. Everyone wants this project to start - except me. I told every one that I had a bad feeling. There are still some processes open which needs to be discussed first. Many new processes resulted in this project. But noone felt responsible for this.

We also had a ""testphase"". We had a testsystem everyone could access. But oh well noone felt responsible.

So yea, lets go. Get this shit show started..

And guess what, the last month was a nightmare. So many things went wrong. Many things which cost this company money. Working every day 10 hours+ with the pressure of the whole company on our shoulders..

I did have 2 weeks vacations but it did not feel like relaxing. Since this project started I have always work in my mind. What if I come to work tomorrow and the next big problem got revealed? I sometimes have some kind of panic attacks. Crying, feeling down, fast heart beating, waking up at night if I could even sleep.

Just thinking about this place, the people makes me sick.

The relationship to my girlfriend suffers from this too.she is stressed because of some exams.We had also some relationship problems in the past. This mess wont help there.She also has some problems at work being some kind of suggestion or complaint box for her coworkers. Having to listen to their shit all day. And after work theres my shit..

I just want to stay home. Cancel my job or go to the doctor. But can I deal with this? Leaving my coworkers by them selves? On the other hand they were the people wo wanted this project to be started finally.",06Aug2020,1
36,"I was on a nostalgia train and seeing the stuff I used to watch on Youtube 13 to 10 years ago. It is incredible how much our aesthetics change with years. I was fortunate that my teenage self used to like videos and save into playlists, which I stopped doing a few years ago. But today I was able to rewatch, or at least reminisce about the old videos that made me happy or interested me a long time ago.

The songs are the hardest. They hit you like a meteor and you can't even see it. The emotions returning and you get kind of happy to have a piece of sound bring you back to an earlier life, and also kind of sad because you are not anymore on it. Nostalgia is a profound feeling, which can get you no matter your age.

But there is an important thing I've learned: There is a lot of videos saved from my old playlists which are private or even deleted forever. I am not able to know what videos those are now. Not that it does matter much, they are just memories, but still. Something that you had and you cannot even think about it.

I also saw some videos that my friends from High School uploaded on their youtube channels and everyone just forgot about it. I am glad I was able to save the videos where I am on it, as now I have a better sense of digital preservation.

And there are so much more that I kind of lost. Conversations with my friends from MSN. I think I have some backup on a few cds at my dad's house, but I don't think they work... nor that I will be able to play it. I hope so. Imagine being able to cringe about your kid self remember talking to people you don't even think anymore? I met so many people online, and there were also so many people from middle school and high school... I wonder who I was and who they were.

I unfortunately don't take many pictures. But I think I need to make a system to save everything it is important to me right now, even if not in the future. Keep a register of who I am over the years. Fuck, this might be the only thing I might have in decades from now.

Honestly, I don’t know if that ever existed as a thought for anyone other than a white U.S. middle schooler. Especially now (and many times before), it seems the furthest thing from existing here.

I have a better relationship with my mom but I love them both dearly and appreciate literally everything single thing they’ve done for me.

Then she stopped and asked me for change? I was definitely not expecting her to ask me for change so I just awkwardly smiled and said nothing and continued on. I heard her swear at me, call me a bitch or something, as I was walking. 

Yeah, no clue what was up with that. I guess she asked because I had a Walgreens bag? She wasn’t sitting in the sidewalk asking for change, she was actively walking so I didn’t expect her to ask for money. As I kept walking after she swore at me I just thought “eh. fair enough.”

I'm a massive sap by nature and do not like getting into arguements or even strong debates with my romantic partners for fear they will leave me (despite never being left). A part of me wants an un wavering assurance that he'll love me through thick and thin, all of my flaws and my quick to judge mouth (which I'm working on). 
But we had a miss understanding on a comment I made and he blew up, in my opinion way more than the comment deserved, but it was less his reaction and more his tone that was harsh and has left me feeling very upset, not listened too and without a chance to explain (I tried but he seemed in interested).

Moments like this just make me feel as though that unconditional love doesn't exist beyond your family and at some point it'll be gone with nobody else around to make you feel that way again.

I have heard to following types of reasoning,  which will get progressively more ridiculous:  


&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Coronavirus ist real, but it's not nearly as bad as people make it out to be. It's similar to influenza.

No. Corona is worse than influenza. It's more [infectious and has a higher mortality rate](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-similarities-and-differences-covid-19-and-influenza?gclid=CjwKCAjw1K75BRAEEiwAd41h1Gy_AcHb8NuA4PMcK2F-umefQdMB9ZuuJTG4lQhyL8wMZsAJapcd0RoCGxMQAvD_BwE). Arguably, it's not *much* worse than Influenza, but it still is worse overall. And we as a society should protect those who are most vulerable if we can. Why let yet another additional disease run free instead of containing it? Just because we already have to deal with diseases like Influenza doesn't mean we should just ignore any new viruses.

  


&gt;Coronavirus is make up / planned by politicians so they can make money through stock market manipulation &amp; investing into mask selling companies.

This one is easy to refute. First off, this would require **all** countries to be in on it. Otherwise the majority of experts from some countries would make it public that it's all a hoax. Firstly, this makes no economic sense at all because you wouldn't have to just pay every politician but also nearly every worker and expert in the medical field. Secondly, some countries urged people at the beginning to not buy masks. Government officials can make money much easier by simply being corrupt.

  


&gt;Coronavirus caused by Bill Gates so we can all get vaccinated and computer chiped.

Again, this would require all countries to be in on it. If just one country refuses to make vaccines mandatory then we already now that the plan is either not real or it failed. Also, why would one of the most powerful men on earth need to ""chip"" everybody in order to control them? Do you think Bill Gates can't influence your life by simply paying politicans and other government workers? If Bill Gates wanted to, he could get you assasinated and there wouldn't even be a trace that you ever existed.

63,"A little backstory: I have autism spectrum disorder. For most of my youth, I also suffered from Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). I, however, never told anyone and thus never received any therapy or treatment. In high school, I did the bare minimum to pass and receive a diploma. Right after high school I started attending a community college because I knew that was what my parents wanted because they knew that I had the potential to earn a Bachelor's degree. I rarely ever attended class for years, and by the time it was time for me to graduate with an associate's degree, I had to admit to my parents that I in fact am not graduating. I failed almost every class, with the exception of some nice professors who for some reason gave me a D (and in one case a B). They didn't know I suffered from MDD, and at age 15 I had convinced myself that there was no reason to do well in school because I will have committed suicide by the time that I would start to notice the consequences of doing poorly.

That was 7 years ago. Fastforward to 2018, I felt like I'd gotten my life a little more on track. I felt more comfortable with myself, I was working a job at a convenience store, I had finally decided what I wanted to do for a living (physics), I felt good about myself. I planned to attend the same community college I had before. My GPA was 0.7 with 49 credits already taken. I had dug myself such a deep hole that the college only let me take up to 8 credits at a time.

Fastforward again to 2020, I have raised my GPA to a 1.9 through much hard work. However, I've amassed $5000 in debt, which doesn't seem like a lot but it is when you consider me being unemployed at the moment. Luckily, due to COVID-19, there is loan forbearance at the moment on most student loans. Unluckily, per my SAP agreement at my college, I am under the required GPA (2.1) to receive any more student aid. There is no way that I can think of to pay for my classes.

I've applied to two online physics programs at two universities with the hopes that a SAP agreement won't be a shackle, however their minimum GPA requirements are still above my cumulative GPA. I'm currently waiting on any news on whether or not I've been accepted.

TL;DR - I screwed up in high school and college because I thought I would have killed myself by the time that it mattered, but I didn't kill myself and now I have to deal with the consequences but I seem to have hit a massive wall in my attempts to remedy my situation.

If there is anything anyone could help me with or suggest I do about  this, please... I am desperate.",06Aug2020,1

One point I nodded in agreement at something she said in a moody way and she said ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ in an annoyed way. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. 

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley/giggly way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it too",06Aug2020,1

78,"So I’m embarrassed and ashamed to admit that I might have a problem with drinking. 

Over the past several months, I typically would have 2-3 drinks a night and justify it by saying I’m not getting drunk so it’s not too big of a deal. 

But I’ve noticed that I’ve been making more frequent trips to the liquor store and justifying have a couple of beers every night just for the sake of it. 

For numerous reasons, I want to get healthier though (mentally and physically). I know that starts with diet and alcohol.  I do have to say I’m somewhat proud of myself, even though 1 week doesn’t seem like much. I haven’t had any urges, I’ve cut down on junk food, and I’m sleeping better. 

Next week, I’d like to start getting into an exercise routine!

Eventually, I’d like to get to a point where I can have a couple of beers over the weekend since I do like craft beer. But I’m sure it’s for the best to abstain for a while to ensure it doesn’t creep its way back into weekdays.",06Aug2020,1
86,"I feel empty. I feel so drained, and tired. Part of me feels guilty about the whole issue, necause she did tell me that she didn't want to hurt me and that she was going through some bad moments. But I was honestly tired at that point, because I felt like she would put a load on me and then blame me of something, then ignore me for days. I was honestly tired of that pattern and, I don't know, I felt like there was no solution at that point. If we got back together we would just repeat the same patterns. 

It's actually really soul crushing, because aside from that she was really a good friend and a fun person to be around, but I realized that this just wasn't the best thing for us. I wasn't helping her and she wasn't helping me either. 

Another part of me felt so angry, I was so mad at her because of her attitude towards me. I tried my best to express myself without irony and remembering that she has feelings too. And finally, the last part feels relieved, like I took a load off my shoulders, I feel guilty for saying that but, it is what it is.",06Aug2020,1

6 months ago my face got larger looking mainly around the cheeks and middle of face) and made me look skinnier as it was then out of proportion to my skinny fat  body (I have a severe pot belly too) but it went larger too. as I gained weight from 11.1 stone to 11.10 stone. 

Recently I went down to 11.3 again and jogged  but hardly any difference definitely but looks larger too. as I want and I still have the pot belly and larger sized  head and my body seems larger overall too. . It’s difficult to get below 11.3 stone even with fasting tbh so that’s the threshold.

92,"Recently I’ve come to an epiphany where I’ve realized that I’ve gotten older. You’re always aging, but I had a bittersweet moment where I realized I’m not the same kid I was last year.

Maybe it’s different for me, I have mild PTSD and recently I’ve been grieving a loss of my childhood. My best friend was diagnosed with cancer this year (she’s okay now!), I was very mentally unstable, and only recently have I started to find peace in my life. I’m enjoying the sound of the rain and looking at the stars more. Recently I have felt like I can finally breathe.

I’m seventeen and I know that there will be many points in my life where I have this realization. But I looked in the mirror this morning and I’ve noticed that I look older. A bit hardened and it seems like I can stand up a bit taller. I don’t know where I’m going in life but I’ve now found comfort in leaving room for the unknown.

93,"I don't mind if no one reads this, I don't mind if she sees this, I need a non biased place to vent. I don't have many friends, and zero friends that understand this. 
Seemed like strangers might be the best and most honest people to talk at. So apologies if this turns out to be an essay. 

Context, 

me and my now ex had been together for several years.
She loved me more than anyone has before and I felt lucky to have that.
Don't get me wrong I was far from a perfect boyfriend. I hit the self destruct button a few times, we broke up and I went back on hands and knees and she always took me back. She's an amazing woman, strong and loving. I have nothing but good words to say about her. For a long time I really thought I'd found the one. 

Things were comfortable. Then lockdown happened, and we ended up living together in a rented bedroom, I rent a room in a friend's house. Space is limited and there's no real escape from each other. It's true test i guess being couped up day after day with no space from each other. But until this point we had never lived together. Just going with the flow and saving for a house together.
I got made redundant from work due to covid-19 , so started a new job. And that's where everything kinda went sideways for me.

This woman, I had known from my previous job, we never really talked, said hi and went about our day.
And then she started at the new place i work at. 

But this time she blew me away. Instant connection, the like of which I'd never experienced. We got on, we laughed, we talked about everything. She always looked me in the eyes when talking to me, and eye contact is hard for me to maintain, but felt like she looked into me when we talked.

She was married (found out later that she wasn't but was in a relationship of sorts) 
I had a long term girlfriend.
Everything should've been safe, I thought it was. 

Then in a really fucked up moment, we kissed... Time slowed down, all reason went out the window, it was a kiss in its most basic form. It was electric, like most first kisses. 
Over in a few seconds but left a lasting WTF JUST HAPPENED. 
We basically talk a lot still, she knows what she wants.... Me... And a but part of me wants her. I'm 100% sure I've fallen for her. But it wouldn't be fair to anyone at the moment to chase things up. If that ever happens at all. 

Now I live with a messed up head, mental health issues ill openly admit it. I'm not ashamed of it, but I'm ashamed of what I do in times of not having a clear head. I didn't realise at the time that I was drowning in myself and throwing away a lot. 

I spent a few weeks, coming home to my ex, saying I love, kissing her, falling asleep in each others arms... It was usually the perfect end to any day, good or bad. I'm a simple man of simple pleasures. 
But this time round I was losing sleep, I couldn't bare to cuddle up to her. There was too much going through my head. 

Is this what I want. 
Do I love her the same anymore. 
Is she aware of my distance at the moment. 
What do I want. 
Who do I want. 
Why. 
How. 
What's going to happen. 

A lot of the usual questions. A lot of the usual lack of sleep. 
Now.... I do love my ex, she's been/was my best friend for a long time. She's been the only constant in my life that I could trust unequivocally with no price to pay. I regret to say I never used that to the best of either of our advantages, I bottle things up, I struggle to openly talk about how I feel, what I want for myself, what I wanted for us. 
But I don't love her the same anymore, I possibly hadn't for a while. Its hard to tell or pinpoint when you fall out of love, or to put it better, stop being IN love. But I would still move heaven and earth for that woman. She deserves nothing less. 

So on a Saturday, lunch time-ish, I ended it. 
I'd spent all morning gazing into space, not able to look at her even fucking once, I couldn't look at her. I didn't see if she was worried about me, I didn't see anything. 
I went for a smoke, she went to make tea for us. And then she crouched down behind me and wrapped her arms around me.... Asked me what was wrong. 
I broke.
 I knew I had to make that call. I've hurt her in the past, previously mentioned, I am far from perfect. 
We went upstairs and I told her the truth of it... I had met someone else.... 

How?.... That has never been a more painful question to answer. 
I didn't mention this kiss, although going back through it in my head I was sure I had. Stressful moments, important details get left out. 
For the first time that day, I looked at her and saw someone's entire fucking world get ripped out from under their feet. I'll never forget it. 

Spent a day or 2 answering her questions as best as I could. But I'm heartbroken that she's heartbroken. It's of my own hand it's this way. I'm just being honest. 

I rejoined Facebook to connect with old friends. A few days after, which didn't go down well to be honest. Seems self serving.... I've been vaguely posting things that are going on in my head. 
I know she sees. 
She's pissed at me. I expected it. I wasn't ready for it. 
A few girls from work have added me on FB already, none of them are THE girl, I won't allow that, not now. 
My ex knows I'm struggling with my own mistakes. I don't expect any sympathy, this was my choice to make. I shall own it. But carrying on and pretending nothing had happened would only cause issues further down the line. 
I know it came without any real warning or anything. And it kills me. 

The other woman, she's been very very understanding of this situation, she's supportive and is there when I need to vent, but it's still biased. I can't fault her for that. She wants me in her life.

I'm just struggling to process my thoughts and actions at the moment, I guess that's normal? 
I don't regret them, the right thing to do is never easy, especially when you care. 

I guess this is an open love letter to love given up. 

A heartbroken piece of work venting out to the world. 

Either way, sorry to have written an absolute essay, but I needed a medium to jot my thoughts down and get everything off my chest. 

Feel free to say anything if you must.",06Aug2020,1
94,"So basically, I kinda see myself has having two major potential motivators:

1. ""I'll show them."" If I'm angry, bitter, and wanting to show up people I feel wronged me in the past, I go into my hard-edged thing. This is where achievements like money, fame, climbing the ladder, having an attractive girlfriend to show off, etc. matter the most. Why? Because I want to shove it all in their faces. This is problematic, because it makes me not the best person, and closes me off in ways I know I will regret (and already do).

2. I'm lonely. If I find peace with the stuff above, I look around and find the rat race very empty, and that there's no one in my life. Seems like something better in one way, but in this mindset, I'm less 'tough'. That drive to go to the gym and pump out reps, or the like, is gone. Instead, I tend to get stuck on wishing I was in certain places. I see some group of people over social media, and deeply wish I could be a part of their group, and start thinking about goals literally with the primary purpose of getting there. This is unstable as well, because over time I might get hooked on one idea, and then another later on, so it's not consistent, it's just based on the emotion of needing to be a part of those things that are striking me at that point.

...and those seem like my two choices. Both suck. The first at least keeps me from feeling as sad, but when I step out of it it's like ""what am I thinking!?"" The second is miserable, gives me less general drive to achieve, and doesn't have a practical, realistic, and consistent goal attached to it. In the first mindset, I could maybe find happiness in a job purely for the sake of raw achievement and climbing the ladder and making more money, but that goes entirely away in the second, and those jobs seem like hell. In the second mindset all I seem to want to do is find a place where I can be with peers and do creative fun stuff with them, but you have to be pretty lucky and spend a long time developing a way to find income doing that, and I don't have that kind of time.

So, dunno what to do with that.",06Aug2020,1
95,"Deep down, It is just a past experience that happened yesterday and after all ,these things treated me well by making me realize how i can get rid of something which is not mine and not virtually valuable to my life anymore.

96,"Just stumbled upon this sub. I don’t post often but I’m feeling introspective so I thought it might be beneficial to write these things down. And why not share my thoughts with the world while I’m at it? We are in a quarantine but I can still talk to people on the internet, which is pretty fucking amazing, really.

I have a few questions/musings I’d like to ask/muse on. Most of what I’d like to discuss is of an emotional nature and somewhat philosophical. If that’s not your cup of tea then swipe left. Or right. I don’t fucking know, I’ve never had a Tinder account. That shit is scary.

The main subject here is love. I mean who doesn’t want to talk about love? It’s such an interesting topic because it’s subjective and indefinite. Despite the fact that experiencing this emotion, or conglomerate of emotions that we decided to sum up with one word, the commonality of it all is that most of us, at one point or another, have felt it. For the sake of clarification, I’m talking about romantic love. I’m not placing romantic love above other types of love, it’s just what I’m choosing to touch on at this juncture.

First of all, how do you know you love someone? There is often a distinction made between being in love with someone and loving someone. I think these  can coexist as well as exist independently. But how do you know you’re *truly* experiencing either of them or both?  Do you just *know*? Does one last longer than the other? Emotions are generally very little understood from a scientific standpoint. So knowing that whatever you’re feeling is *real* is simply deciding that it’s real for you. Or not. 

How many of us have felt something that seemed so real that we were certain it was love? Weeks, months, or even years later, we may arrive at a different conclusion. Does that mean that the emotion you felt was misconstrued? Perhaps you decided that it was infatuation. Or maybe just a really bad crush. Whatever the case, it’s impossible to be sure.

It’s interesting how we all quantify love differently. You might measure it by the intensity, perhaps by the qualities in a person with which you find yourself enamored, maybe through the test of time or simply by how they treat you or vice versa. Time is one that stands out to me but I don’t know that it holds any more significance than any of the other ways we try and weigh the validity of what we’re feeling.

Personally, I think I’ve been in my love twice in my life. For reference, I am 34 years old. Not sure why that matters but there it is. I suppose if I were 16 then people would be rolling their eyes. So it does matter. I found myself talking out loud this morning and it’s also what inspired this post. I told myself that I have never been in love like this.

And that’s just the thing isn’t it? Each person we love is it’s own unique experience. There are a million factors that shape it. I *have* been in love before. I’ve also had people tell me it wasn’t love. It was a messy situation. He wasn’t a nice guy. But I loved that guy. Maybe he didn’t love me back, maybe it wasn’t a healthy relationship, but I loved him. I’ve also heard the argument that love isn’t valid unless it runs both ways. I don’t agree.

What made me say that though? If I believe that I was in love before, why is what I’m currently experiencing more significant? Is it because I’m simply over the old one and this is what is inhabiting my heart space right now? He is not my boyfriend and we haven’t been intimate, at least not physically. Yet there is so much sexual chemistry that it’s almost palpable. We do have, in my opinion at least, a very deep connection that I have *never* felt before. It feels significant. But I also felt that way about the other guy when I was falling for him. I think this is just different, in a good way. 

We have conversations and I get lost in them. I get lost in the back and forth exchange, in his creative insights, his humor, his eyes and his beautifully unique way of looking at the world. I find myself truly happy when I’m talking to him. We talk about art, philosophy, sometimes politics, the people around us that we both know (not always in a gossipy way, but yeah, that too). Frankly the subject matter doesn’t matter. Every exchange I have with this person, I am lost and found at the same time. I am not thinking of anything else in the world but the conversation at hand. I believe I love him. I could be wrong. I guess I’ll never know.

Thoughts? All are welcome. Peace and love.",06Aug2020,1

99,"Today is my cake day and upon reflecting the kind people and communities of Reddit have helped me to: 

Keep myself sane and not feel alone during an abusive relationship- and to end it

Understand the toxic messages I ingrained in my life which lead me to accept mistreatment and toxicity from others 

Prevent myself from falling into decade long patterns of limerence and become aware of my addiction and know how to treat it

Heal from decades of pain and trauma and to find empowerment 

Celebrate the parts of myself I’ve kept hidden because they weren’t accepted in my personal life

Build community with people who understand me for the very first time 

I’ve had lots of help with mental health through my life and I’ve dedicated myself to personal growth long before this year. But therapists usually don’t know about certain groups of people who don’t seek help and so their insight is very limited. They don’t know much about covert narcissism, or limerence. I would have been in the dark for years.

What a gift. Reddit has changed my life, literally. I would be half as self aware if it weren’t for all of you people. So from the bottom of my heart thank you.",06Aug2020,1

101,"As I sat around last night trying to think about what to say about the passing of my brother Aaron, I was so wracked with anxiety knowing that nothing I could ever write would be able to do such a beautiful and complicated person justice. There’s nothing that I could say that could make sense of a tragedy that will be deeply felt for a lifetime to come. 

Anyone who knew Aaron knew of the struggles that would eventually go on to take his life. I think that whenever there’s a tragedy that’s so real and so profound, human instinct has us questioning every interaction and replaying every conversation, trying to find the one thing we could have done differently. But in truth, all that we can do is provide love, whatever form that love takes. And love was something that Aaron felt. He took pride in his family, and I wish that he could have understood more deeply the pride we took in him. 

For years, people viewed his addiction as his defining characteristic when he was just so much more than that.  On the surface, he had problems that were highly visible and incredibly heartbreaking. But underneath, Aaron was like an iceberg. He had a never ending depth and when it surfaced, you had no doubt of the loving and compassionate brother, son, friend, and family member that he actually was. 

Those who knew him will tell you what a genuine, kind, witty, and extremely gentle soul he was. Unless you crossed him which is something that I learned very well growing up. He was a man of simple pleasures, taking enjoyment out of phone calls with family, a fresh piece of paper, or even a single cigarette- things that most of us take for granted. While I could sit and argue for hours about what food I wanted to eat- to Aaron it didn’t matter. He was just happy and thankful to have a meal. He loved fantasy books and the escapism that music and poetry would bring. Art helped to take him out of his own head and bring him into a narrative where he could leave behind the ailments of this world and live whatever life he wanted to- free of disease or the shackles of his own addiction.

He had a lifelong dream of traveling to see the world, something that he was never able to do. But now, we make that wish come true because each and every one of us, in some way, are going to always carry him with us. He gave us a million little moments in life, and it’s still not enough. When sitting here trying to think of my favorite memories with my brother, spontaneous moments always come flooding back. The things that you brush off or don’t regard as important in the moment wind up becoming some of the most precious things you’ll ever have. They’re the things that are the most real. 

My brother’s life ended in a moment of darkness, which is ironic for someone who was capable of such light. I searched for hours trying to find the exact words to express the immense loss that I feel, not just for what we had, but for all that was still yet to come and there is nothing more honest that I can say other than I simply love him, and I miss him. He  very rarely lost hope, even in his darkest hours. He always hoped to start over, and he pushed himself to heal much more than would be possible many of us. From hospital conversations to Christmas morning cigarettes, he was always optimistic. Always looking forward to a better future. His story has touched hearts, and though he’s not here to continue writing it, I will always try my best to continue writing it for him. Thank you.",06Aug2020,1
102,"I’ve always been very insecure about the fact that vaginas “smell”. It made me not want to be eaten out because I was afraid my sexual partner would make a bad face, or would be turned off by the smell/taste (even though it’s a sign of healthiness, and I don’t smell especially strong). I visited my boyfriend a while ago and he ate me out. Keep in mind this is a man who has told me before that he doesn’t like when vaginas smell funny.

He loves how I smell. He said he actually really enjoyed eating me out and he’d like to do it again. I honestly thought he was joking at first. Nope. He likes it. He enjoys the way I taste and giving me that pleasure. I am so fucking happy right now!!!!",06Aug2020,1

105,"I am interested in working on myself and trying to feel good in the longterm. I released a video today about what is shadow work and how you can use it to work on yourself. I talk about the importance of this work and why I think that it can sometimes be more helpful than trying to force yourself to think positively (although that is also good and there needs to be balance). I think that supression of negative things starts in childhood (unexpectedly :D) and so on it continues into adult life and causing problems for people, cause they start to use defence mechanisms to deal with their shadow. And in shadow there can be supressed things, which can be both positive and negative, including your potential and purpose in life. 

I am not sure if I can post this post in here, cause in fact this is self promotion, but I love talking about things which I do and what I am working on, so I would love to chat about this, if you have any experience in working on your shadow and if it helped you? 

Have a nice now you all.

110,"I (26F) remember quite a while ago, I was waiting for my train to come. As I was standing on the platform with still quite a while to wait, an older man on the opposite platform caught my eye. These two platforms were level with the tracks and as such, you could walk between platforms directly over the walkway built within a part of the tracks. 

This man, the only thing he did, was look at me and hook and wag his finger in the “come here” motion. It was so rude. He didn’t smile. Didn’t say hi. Didn’t say “excuse me, could I ask you a question?” Just summoned me over with his entitled-ass finger.

Now, I’m someone who is TERRIFIED of anyone who asserts even a crumb of authority over me. I buckle at the weakest “hey!” from anyone, and it’s really negatively impacted my self-esteem over the years. For some reason, I have a REALLY hard time doing what so many others seem to have no issue with - saying “fuck that” and walking away. 

So I literally went out of my way to cross the tracks, go right up to the man so that his princess ass didn’t have to travel a single step, and ended up giving him train info that he needed. Literally MONTHS later, I still look on this experience with shame and self-loathing. It makes me feel so weak and meek, while on the inside, I like to feel like a badass roaring lion who doesn’t take shit. 

So this morning, I was at the same train stop. An older man did something very similar - they were on my side of the tracks this time, and as I was the only other one there, this man caught my gaze and did the fucking finger thing at me!!!! What the fuck is with that?!?!?!?

So I gave him a passive look, kept my gaze rolling over our whole surrounding, and paid him absolutely no mind. I saw him crane his neck a little to get back into my view, and while my heart was pounding so loud that I couldn’t even hear anything else, I *stood my ground* and pretended not to notice. Respecting myself would mean that if a stranger wants something from me, I’m not going to serve them on a silver platter. They can come up to me and use their big boy words. 

IT FUCKING WORKED!!!!!!! He finally conceded, and walked up to me and asked something about the train schedule. I told him what he needed to know, and then he walked his ass back to the spot he was waiting in before. 

I’m just so fucking proud of myself. Now *that’s* self-respect, and tbh I’m cheesing ear to ear just thinking about it now a few hours later!!",06Aug2020,1

113,"I have myalgic encephalomyelitis (essentially extreme chronic fatigue) and a constant, daily headache that I’ve had since September of 2013. Every day is dominated by debilitating fatigue, headaches (sometimes migraines), lack of focus, brain fog, lack of motivation and mild depression at times. Every aspect of my life has been affected by this. Relationships, social situations, personal goals, my education etc etc. 

At times I will feel as though I’m being lazy even though I’m really tired and don’t want to do anything. When I use my headache or energy level as a reason not to do something I feel as though I’m letting someone down. I can see the change in their face. It happens constantly. Cancelled plans and incomplete tasks are extremely common. It doesn’t help that I have lots of social anxiety as well so when I do disappoint someone it really weighs on me. Plus not wanting to really put much effort into social situations doesn’t help, obviously 

What I’ve been feeling lately is that I really am lazy and I’m leaning into my disability too hard. I’m using it as a crutch for some self destructive behavior. I try very hard to do something, or at least I think I’m trying, and then when it gets too hard I’ll stop or give up. It’s way too common. I just don’t know if it’s my body telling me to rest or part of my personality that knows that I have an out if I don’t want to do something so I don’t try as hard. I feel like I might be enabling myself to feel this way. Idk. It’s very confusing at times and I’m really wrestling with this. 

Sorry my pain meds are kicking in and I’m just rambling now. But if anyone has any insight I’d appreciate it. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.",06Aug2020,1

Hello , I’m a 16 year old teenage male and my girlfriend of one year has gone crazy and I need advice on how to deal with it.


Me and my current girlfriend dated for one year and nothing was wrong , we had great chemistry and almost never fought , but around June of this year her brother died in a car crash , this deveasted her and me , he was like a brother to me.


Ever since then my girlfriend has slowly been going down a dark path , she tells me she’s constantly fighting with her parents and that is worrying to me , one day when we were hanging out she told me she would knife down any girl who makes a move on me , i took it as a joke then but now it’s becoming closer to reality 

If I take even a minute to not respond she will blow up my phone , she wants to hang out every day now.

When I went over her house to get something I left there I accidentally peeped into a room with a large shotgun , I never spoke about it but now I’m scared shitless , her health is breaking down and she’s losing an unhealthy amount of weight 

I have to do something but I don’t know what , what should I do? Is my life in any danger? 

Along with her drastic change in actions and words , she’s been asking for sex a lot more and acting a lot more lovey dovey than before , What does this mean?

She’s also having extreme mood swings with me , switching between loving girlfriend and violent girlfriend continuously, what should I do?? And what do the mood swings mean?",06Aug2020,1

119,"There have always been assholes on the internet, but I feel like people have been being noticeably shittier to each other in the past few years. Facebook in particular— every single day I see people being unnecessarily rude and combative over stuff that really shouldn’t be sparking so much conflict. I like being on Facebook so I can connect with friends and people with similar interests, but I’m getting tired of seeing people devolve into middle school bullies over the slightest disagreements. 

I don’t think it’s always been *this* bad. For example, I’m a long time Animal Crossing player and was in some trading groups for the old DS game a few years ago before New Horizons was out. They were always positive places where we just helped each other out and chatted about the game together. Now, in the new groups for the new game, people run around calling each other dumb c*nts for having a different opinion on something in the game. And this kind of thing happens in eeeeevery kind of community, all the time. Whether it’s a group about cats, video games, makeup, whatever— people can’t seem to go a single day without arguing and resorting to name-calling over something stupid. And as someone who tries really hard to be polite to everyone unless I’ve got a good reason not to, and to remember that behind every social media profile is a real person with real feelings, seeing this happen all the time makes me sad. 

This post probably makes me seem like the ultimate Millennial Snowflake™, but I’m just really tired of seeing people jump at every opportunity to belittle or insult someone they don’t even know over something that doesn’t even matter. Does anyone else feel this way?",06Aug2020,1

Me and my boyfriend moved away for college and have a two bedroom apartment where I have one bedroom as my study room/ guest bedroom since i have a pullout couch. I like living by myself with my boyfriend we get along perfectly, i like to keep things very clean and organized and I feel like i have a lot more privacy and spontaneity. I like my boyfriend's brother, and I like their mom as well so I feel selfish when considering I don't want him to move in. But he has stayed with us for a couple of weeks in the past and i just get stressed because he isn't the cleanest person, and i feel already i have a lot of responsibilities and not enough time so the thought of me having to nag and always be cleaning up stresses me out plus is going to make me the bad annoying person and i don't want to be that. I know that it is for his best interest to move in because he will have just finished his GED and could get a part time job here to help pay for his part of the bills. He has always been babied at home, never had a job, responsibilities or anything. So although it would be good for him to grow up, i feel a lot of responsibility will be put on me. When he js here my boyfriend and him just play a lot of videogames or go play basketball and stuff so i am scared it will be like that all the time and i will get no alone time to hang out and do stuff with my boyfriend. Also I would have to move everything out of my study room to make it his room and then i am left with no sanctuary where i can get away from everything to concentrate on my studies, i am pre med and my classes require a lot of dedication. Overall i am excited to enjoy my new Two bedroom apartment withb just my pets and my boyfriend, but now if his brother moves in i feel i will be so stressed and it wont feel like my hpuse anymore. Plus is not even a guarantee he will get a job and pay for his part of the rent and utilities. I guess i feel like i am gonna have to be a mom and i simplu dont want to and dont have time.

133,"I've been down on myself a lot lately. This stems from my sexual frustration and falling way short of my potential.

Sexually frustrated because I'm spending hours out of my day swiping and DM'ing constantly. It doesn't feel so much like I'm trying to find love as it is chasing leads. People don't take into account the effort that men have to put into messaging. I can't just say ""hey"" and expect anything. I have to deconstruct profiles and construct texts that lead to engaging conversation. With many, this turns into long, promising correspondences with lots of flirtation and interest in meeting up. But then it inevitably dies down. Keep in mind, it's enough with one person, but when you're doing this with multiple people, it's like a full time job.

While I've had success, it's such a low return on investment. Even when there is one, there's no guarantee that I'll get to have that experience with them again. Earlier this year I was battling erectile dysfunction. I was with an incredibly attractive girl, and as I was in the bed, I thought, ""why is this happening? I've been looking forward to this so much."" I felt empty. Then I slept with a couple of girls I wasn't attracted to after that. 

Then I reconnected with someone who I had a one night stand with a couple of years ago. Met up a few weeks ago for a couple of good rounds. Then we met again last week, and it had to be some of the best sex of my life. Everything was going perfectly - three rounds in an hour's time. But the issue is, she has a boyfriend. I know she's not available, but going through long periods without hearing from her makes me feel like I'm going through a breakup all over again. She reaches out occasionally and we'll talk for hours. I will feel better again. Then I'll see where I sent a message to her and I'll be marked as ""read"" with zero response. I feel dead inside again until the cycle repeats.

Society has a way of minimizing the emotional beating men take from getting rejected over and over again. And as a guy, I can't say ""I have a sex addiction"" without it sounding like bragging, but, to be honest, sex is the only thing I look forward to. 

Whenever I go a week without, or when I don't have a steady FWB, I feel dead on the inside. And that unearths every insecurity I have. I have to clear Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat message histories because it crushes me to see reminders of being rejected. The worst was yesterday when I messaged an older woman I used to work with. I had a crush on her. She responded, but then dismissed me by saying ""have a good rest of your day."" Even though it was a polite rejection, it still cut deeper for some reason. I blocked her.

Then I messaged a girl I slept with a few times last year, who works at the coffee place I go to every day. Yesterday, sent her a message mentioning that I saw that she was single again. No reply. I didn't send any messages after that, because I stop as soon as I get the hint. This morning when I got my coffee, she acted very cold and distant towards me. Didn't even make eye contact. It's really depressing to see someone who once acted so friendly towards you become disgusted by you. She was really great in bed and it stung to read old texts where she wanted me to come over for sex.

And now I hate myself. I hate that I'm lazy, and that I'm a college graduate working retail because I am too much of a bum to submit applications. I live at home at the age of 27, and people treat me like a loser for it. I skipped my family Thanksgiving out of social anxiety. I'm condescended to constantly. I have a communications degree, with minors in chemistry and psychology from a private university (with a 3.5 GPA). My professors have told me that I'm bright. I go to the gym. Yet I still don't like my body, I feel stupid, I hate that I am the way I am, I'm on the brink of berating the next customer who treats me like I'm a dumbass. I feel constant jealousy too. I am a loser.",06Aug2020,1
134,"Hello Reddit! I am fairly new here, and I dont fully understand all the threads and sub threads and what to post where... This seems like a fairly ""open"" thread so Im just going to use it as sort of a journal, and if any one wants to share some advice, words of encouragement, or if you just want to skip this over thats okay too. 

I graduated college in May 2018. Already had a job before I graduated, was back together with my boyfriend (we had been broken up for about 5 months- my call), was moving into a house with a couple of my best friends and life was pretty pretty good. 

June 2018. My dad calls me after work, which was kind of out of the norm. My mom was always the ""fun"" parent, definitely was closer with her my whole life. He called to tell me that that morning, before work he found out my mom was cheating on him.

Going to back up here. In 2015 my sister and I had a feeling something sketchy was going on. My mom was holding her phone closer, constantly texting someone named ""Jeanine"". My sister and I NEVER heard her talk about this person. Definitely was not a relative, she had no friends with that name, no coworkers with that name, nothing.  We got ahold of her phone one day, and looked at the actual number. We memorized it and quickly ran to our room to google search it. We found that it was my youngest brothers hockey coach's number. Weird. About a week later, I was outside with my mom, and asked for her phone to play some music. I quickly went to the messages and saw ""I f\*cking love you"" and ""I f\*cking love you too"". At this point I called my sister, and we both knew we had to confront my mom. So we did. And it went horribly. Instead of owning up to anything, she threatened to kick us out, to stop paying for our phones, insurance, food, everything. Though she reacted that way, my sister and I figured and hoped that she would get her act together. (At this time, we did not tell our Dad as we felt it was her responsibility, and again, we just hoped she'd get her act together)

Back to June 2018. I didn't really know what to say to my Dad. He was asking for advice, but I had none for him, and he had none for me. He went to divorce lawyers but unfortunately, in the state we live in, just because my mom cheated on him did not mean that he wouldn't have to pay. The only way that he would not have to give her money, is if she on her own, moved out. So instead of moving out, my mom continues to live at my house,  sleeps in the guest bedroom, comes and goes as she pleases, STILL hangs out with this man, and is essentially a stranger to all of us. Ive gone to therapy. Ive written her letters explaining exactly how I feel, asking her why, asking for some sort of explanation and have received nothing. What hurts the most is the lack of empathy for her. Not just towards my Dad, but to her children. It is so embarrassing having a parent that cheats. Its disgusting, confusing, horrible, awful, and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I feel lost. No one knows what to say, no one has any answers, except for my mom. I feel like she's going through a mid-life crisis and that's why all of this is happening, but again, I have no real answers. Ive truly tried everything, and though its been 2 years, and I tell everyone that I'm over it, I know that I'm not. I have dreams, at least 3 times a week that Im able to confront my mom and get some answers out of her, and then I wake up and Im left with nothing. She clearly does not understand how her actions have affected her children. 

Sorry for the long post, again even if no one ever reads this, I'm glad to have gotten it out. Thanks",06Aug2020,1

139,"Hello my name is Sofia I'm 16 years old and I'm from Russia and I have 2 years to survive before my end.

A while ago I made one post in subreddit about immigration, but everything I got is a lot of downvotes and mainly got ignored. Like I got ignored by everything my whole life.

First of all, I gonna say why I have a time limit, there a lot of reasons for that. I don't sure what I should begin, but in short my current status:

* I have big problems with my family. Begining with no right to at least have a hair cut ending with dad that can get drunk, go back home and destroy everything, and beat my mom. Every day when both parents are home there are endless scandals and constant words about divorce.
* My mother always telling me about her problems since I was a little child. And keep talking like I was born to help her and at the same time, she can say why did I give birth to you. I sometimes respond with ""I didn't ask you to give birth to me""
* Even my little brother hates me, make fun of me, call me a girl, that I look like a girl (don't sure how I should react, because I'm transgender), can punch me... I mean will punch me.
* Also, I eating instant noodles and the cheapest food, because we don't earn very much, a few times we don't even have enough money to pay for rent.
* I crying for almost every day. And it's doesn't even matter when my parents saw it, like if it was ok to always cry.
* I have problems at my school. Not only school bullies have hated me, but also some teachers. Bullies can beat me with a big crowd and even if I going lye down they gonna kick me.
* I can't be myself. I can't have my own opinion, every opinion is done by my mother, I can't say It's bad, but sometimes I don't want to be a robot that does whatever they say with no rights to say ""I want"" or simply say ""no""
* I have no friends because they weren't my actual friends. I always used to be their doll with they can play. They betrayed me, they make fun of me.
* I have nightmares, my past is haunting me. It's made even one scar on my hand.
* If I don't escape this country I will be doomed. When I will be 18 there will be forced conscription that has a problem with ""Dedovshchina"". People like I don't survive there, in the Russian army, it's not for weak people.
* I tried to suicide, but I never go too far.
* No one even cares about me, most of the people that I know hate me, no one can help me, even I...
* I scared of everything, I can't even write to people online, I just scared of them.
* A lot of transphobes make fun of me almost every day.
* Every day I keep thinking about self-harm. And sometimes I do this.
* Every time I want to do something to help myself there is something that trying to stop me and if I try to avoid that everything will be even worse than before.
* I lost belief in humanity. I don't even sure if it even exists.
* My dysphoria is killing me, but with depression, it feels so bad. I can't look at the mirror.
* My country took last rights from trans people so I can't live here anymore
* I'm useless I can't do anything. I can't draw, I can't even complete even an easy target. I'm so stupid...
* I'm broken and I have no sense to live on. Should I continue?......

So this is a small portion of everything that happened to me. I going to tell you some stories and going to open some of these themes that I listed above. I'll begin with my parents. 

When I was 10 years old or less my dad always lost all money in casino on a slot machine. He worked as a guard in the same casino where he lost all money. Once he almost gave away our apartment like that.

Now we running out of money because of coronavirus. He was working at the hotel as a guard. The hotel went bankrupt and we didn't receive payment for 3 months. And he was working not legal there so we were totally dead.

Basically, we trying to survive (4 people) on around $544/month but as I said he loves to lose money so it's looking more like $408/month for 4 people but mainly even less. We need to use them to pay for two apartments that look like very bad, having two bad looking apartments in a bad city doesn't mean we rich. And also we need to pay for an extra apartment where we all live. Sometimes we are being sued for not paying at the right time.

Also, there was a stupid situation so we almost got homeless. My dad's father had our apartment, and so he cheated on my grandmother, who was not even close to me, I never saw her until I was 14 years old and eventually, a child was born, later my dad's father died and their family claimed inheritance, including our apartment, they were also rich and this angered me the most, like why they need our apartment in with we live, but also my mom telling about these problems to me. I was around 10.

The baby is one year old. His Parents: WE NEEAD AN APARTAMENT FOR HIM Because HE iS a bik Boi

We don't even have wallpapers before. Just empty walls actually that place still don't have wallpapers everywhere. Mainly, this was because my dad is lazy he doesn't do anything, he was doing only: Farting on the couch, playing video games on smartphone, annoys everyone, etc. Every hard work was done by my mother and with some of our help (kids)

My dad. He doesn't give a fuck about us. And he always will. He living only for himself and only for himself.

The due first month of quarantine in Russia I was eating only one time per day.

When we had no money, father was god knows where, we can't even live in our house at this moment we lived in grandma house and grandma can't even give money or support us somehow, so mainly we were hungry, 

So I hate my dad, but not my mom, she just trying to save us from our dad.

My mom trying to control my life, watching my every step, it continues to my 14 years old, then and for today she just annoys me with asking what I was doing today or who do I write to, etc.

Also, my mom sometimes trying to make suicide, and it's so hard to stop her, she just going to our medkit and start eating every drug. It's terrible.

My mom and my brother love to make fun of me. Trying to annoy me and made me cry. Telling jokes about me, and if I don't act like I don't care, they gonna make fun of me even more.

My mother almost every time very sick. She just sneezed and broken spine or something, she felt so bad, so she crying of pain I asked her for calling to a hospital, but she declines. Every time she looks like she gonna die right now she doesn't want to call for help to the hospital.

Yesterday (6th August) my mom almost set the whole house on fire, by putting a wooden circle on a gas stove and then a big bowl of bad soup, and then after a while, it ignited, and a great column of fire rose and a lot of smoke came out.

My dad drunk at least one time per week. He often loses his items such a phone because he literally can sleep under the fence of some house. He destroyed a lot of things in our house. The fridge still has traces of his punches. Rarely, but he can punch me. He doesn't love me at all, he loves only his second son.

Endless scandals. I don't even know what to say about it. I can't protect anyone anymore when dad is angry.

And things that always with me. Whatever someone does something bad, they told me that it was I. In a time of school it makes me wanna die because the whole class told the teacher that I PUNCH myself, poor bullies, how dare me!

While I was in my classroom due to math lessons, there was break time and I sat in my class since I don't have friends and reasons to go out. And then my classmate ran in class with words that I stole sled of some little kid, then class appears and say that's it's true and we saw you, then the school principal and homeroom teacher appeared and they saying that they got me and me in big trouble but God was on my side in this day and teacher start to debate with them how I can steal something while I'm in school sitting in this classroom! Thankfully she able to approve that they wrong. Actually, this is the first time and last time that someone saved me from hell. But all school already thinks that I stole a sled of little kid.

Also, they love to stalk me to my home and scream that I'm ""gay"" and ""pussy"" and other words. When I go downstairs they very often trip me up and then I fall very badly. They also love to hide my clothes so I stay in school for many hours to find my cloth.

I was in school bullies start to say that I miserable, doesn't deserve a feature and many things, but when I can't take it anymore and say something in their side they start to kick me with a crowd, I was laying down, and 4 people just keep kicking me, whole class watch this everyone was happy they said punch harder, kick harder! I think it just like forever.

But at some point it's ended, I can't feel anything, I don't even stand up, I just cried. Then the teacher walks in class and saw me. I think she was thinking ""oh no he\* is crying again!"". Then she said stand up and said go with me, I thought she will finally help me, but I was so wrong. She went with me to high school (I never was in there at this moment), to the headmaster of this school. I sat in her cabinet and she starts to scream at me that everyone got tired of you and you should die we will kick you from school because of your behaviors. I just crying and can't even listen to all the things that she said, I thought I just disappointed my mom. After 1 hour and more of scream at me she said stand up, we gotta go, I asked what do you mean? but don't get a response back. We walked outside with a fire exit door, there was a black tuned car and it has a lot of people inside. At this time I thought I'll die and I start to say sorry for everyone, but mainly for my mother. I thought we gonna ride in the forest because I never saw these places before, the whole road I just praying. No one is speaking. Finally, I saw my house, and parked at the entrance to the entrance (It looks like English doesn't have this word), she said to go out but gives me some document. I slowly walked upstairs, every step I felt worse and worse, and finally, when I was on the 5th floor I ring to door, my mom opened the door I gave her this document and when she asked me ""What happened?"" I started to cry again and fall on my bed. The document contains something about my expulsion from school. It was my worst day. You can say me, why you can't change school but in a place where I live before, there was only one school.

Is I'm a bad person? I'm always tried to help people and animals if I can.

I stop at least three people and my mother of suicide in real life.. don't sure if this counts...

I destroyed a lot of ""columbine"" community everywhere I can and trying to help people, change their minds. So I stop many people of suicide and killing everyone in schools.

There was a thing as 'The Groups of Death' most popular was ""Blue whale"". It was a game in real life where you do some tasks, but then it quickly flows into tasks like ""cut your wrist"" and so on. The ending of this game is to kill yourself, doesn't matter with way, but mainly it's just jumping from a rooftop. I was horrified about this, so I had an idea to create an anti-group of death called ""Pink Flamingo"". Everything was fine, I helped a lot of people, make therapy for them, give advice, and at the end of the game you should be alright and happy, there was no real end. But in one day my group was banned from Vkontakte as I remember for this reason: I created a group of death. Bravo, they even block my own page almost permanent, it was hard to restore it, it was a special ban.

I really remember that I made a lot of happy birthday congratulations on things in windows movie maker to everyone... I was 8 years old or less... I always helped grandmothers, carrying their products, or moving them across the road.

Some bullies wanted to kick poor cat to death, I don't let them do that, so they kicked me... BUT hey! I saved a cat!

When I had internet ""friends"" we had a community, I called it ""TeaTown community"", we were like a big family, I helped to everyone there, they need something I give it to them and a lot of other things, yes they kinda don't like me because I always want to help everyone and it annoys them. And in one day we built a big city with a 10+ player population and I started this community brick by brick with a new friend (everyone knew them even before I appear there) and in one day after a month of friendship he just asks me to add his friend to private since I don't know him and I was scared of security and for everyone, I said no! They start to scream on me and call me a pussy and such and I add him under this pressure and then they immediately kill me and destroyed my house and storehouse of the city I was broken they even used cheats so I can't fight with them. But it's not all, they told something to all of my friends, and everyone started to hate me and they start to don't trust me. I managed to get a little bit of their trust and I became a part of this community again. I build a church and live in there. I still helped to everyone. But in one day someone busted me, he gives access to church to those two who grief me before and then they destroyed my church, no items survived. I actually have a few footages where they were cheating and griefing. Actually, I showed it to admins. And guess what? I got permanently banned. They bought the admins. The main conflict is very stupid, to solve it I need to apologize for not letting them grief me and don't add them immediately to private. Also one of them always saying something I'm a god and you're nothing.

When I finally realized that I'm transgender, I made a coming out and every friend that I have, even my best friend start to hate me even gay one and it made me feel very bad. A was lone for a month and since I can't find new friends I tried to go back to them. They made a lot of transphobic things like burning the trans flag, mis-pronouns me and everything, but in one day they reach something above of normal, when I died I teleported in a strange place, they made a test lab that I need to pass, they gave me adventure mode, some of them was in spectator mode, my ""best friend"" was behind glass, they said hello and then look in the chest I saw a pufferfish that named ""Trans have no right"" they say eat it. I eat it, don't sure why. The next thing was a potion, that I need to drink to be female, but unfortunately, It doesn't work and I got aids, then they give me a wooden pickaxe and said to dig obsidian... 4 blocks of obsidian with a wooden pickaxe, sick bastards! Then there was another room with insane hard parkour. After a while, I passed it and I got into another room where I should choose one of three answers, in fact, some of them were not transphobic like there was a question about Kazahstan with dates. At the end of the quiz, they hide the right answer behind me, so it should make me confused, once it solved I went to the final room. I saw to ""dicks"" and my best friend said choice dick, sit and die, there was a big black one with racism on a sign that gonna destroy all my organs because it's a big and sticky white one with gonna pull out my guts and made me die. I don't remember what I chose, but it was horrible we was a friend for many years and then they do this? How sad, even my ""best friend""

Since that, I don't really have friends anymore.

All my classmates around me in school used drugs and they were very bad and none of them want to be my friend. This why I never had a friend in real life. Everyone in real life was very bad, many of them were in police stations already. Even girls were bad, they drunk too much and engaged in prostitution.

All the people I knew had a boyfriend/girlfriend/whatever at some point, but I never had, so they very shooked when they knew this fact, but I don't think I need that, I don't think I need something, maybe I just don't deserve life. In fact, I don't even sure with sexual orientation is I or do I even want to have someone.

I hate to remember the place where I lived before because of school, memories, and thing like:

I just going to home from school and then from nowhere on a large speed a big van is riding on the sidewalk not even giving any sign. I jumped out at the last moment. It still gives me nightmares. 

Or like when someone kicked me in school when I was going downstairs and then when I was going home someone walking far away and scream that I'm ""faggot"" and other words but then I saw two small dogs. Nothing special, but then huge dogs start to appear from nowhere and I start thinking about going back and find another way to go home, but when I turn my head I realized I already surrounded by huge evil dogs that barked and growled at me and then ran sharply at me. A big crowd of dogs surrounded me and chased me all over the city and I was running for my life, most of these dogs were huge, and I ran from almost 20 dogs. Honestly, I don't know why they can't catch me and where most of them gone when I was pretty close to my home, but it's doesn't matter. Yes and I cried and scream the whole road to home.

Just a typical day of my life. Mainly when I home I'll be saved. But every time I outside. Something bad is going to happen.

Also, teachers called me rude words and lower my grades. Imagine being a kid and the teacher call you a bag of shit that can't do anything.

I was in this place a week ago and I was praying to my mother to not go there, but she starts to say I never coming outside and I should ride or else I can say bye to my laptop. We stuck there for three days we just should be there for one day. We don't even have pillows or blankets. And I meet old school bullies that start to make fun of me one of them even punches me. He called me ""faggot"" again like in past. It was a nightmare. Everyone hates me there. My little brother hates me because I want to leave this nightmare as fast as I can, but he wants to be there for a longer time. I actually made a wrong thing later. 

I wanted to escape and my reason for that was If stay there even more I will kill myself because so many horrifying memories' was there. I just walked to a train station, so basically I escaped from a mom and my little brother. And a bully from school walked to me, I didn't saw him and he said ""Fuck you"" and then he punches me in a face. Well then since I have no money with me right now (and always), so I have a ""perfect"" Idea to walk to my city on foot (48KM to the final station and also a long way to the city), but I just walked just one station is about 4km from there and I got already tired, but also at this moment I realize that I don't have keys for the apartment and also I need to go another 10+ stations + another more things I don't think of, so I went back.

The second reason I do so is that my mom and my brother start to make jokes about me and I just can't stand it.

I returned to a nightmare place and we got stuck here. I still feel very bad.

Actually, this isn't a serious escape because in one-day whole class the whole day made fun of me by calling me with bad words, they tripped me, they spat paper at me, and do much more. And the teacher remarked not to them but ME. I wonder why??? Then everything like in a fog. It was the end of the lesson and someone made my cry, I run out of class and saw fire exit, with tears, I very fast open this door and ran out of school, they tried to stop me, they even grab my backpack, but I ran away. So next I was thinking about getting drown or just die in the forest, maybe even of starving to death, but temporarily I hide somewhere and lay down there. It was a very cold autumn. I don't even wear a jacket and I was alone, thinking about suicide and the end of me, I was laying on trash, I even thought about live like a hobo, Because I can't live like that anymore. My mom can't do anything to help me she can't do it to end. So bullies can't get punished because of that. I always was in bruises. Even more, bullies have come up with an offensive nickname for me because of which I want to change my last name. The worst part that this thing also works in English and almost in every country, because this word sounds almost the same even though it writes very differently.

My poor relatives made me feel very sad and bad, but not every one of them. Looking at an old, lonely grandfather it's so heartbreaking, it's so awful to see a poor uncle stricken with a stroke and other can laugh on the situation, it's so wrong... also recently grandfather killed a cat... he put it somewhere and close it... he doesn't even feed it... a week passed... and then he opened a place where he put cat... but it's already almost died... on next day cat just died.....

Well, I don't do anything bad. I always tried to help people. But everything I received from them it just hates and other sad things. Nothing good. Yes, I made bad stuff and I apologize for that. I apologize that I was born. Wow, it hurt so much. I upset my parents. And I will upset them even more.

Teachers say there is no way I saying the truth because I can't always be ""White and fluffy"". I mean no one even trusts me for some reason. My friends busted me.

I always, every day, for many years keep talking to my parents that I'm going to make suicide, but they say that I don't saw a real-life, I don't live enough, and what kind of troubles you can even have in this age?

My family and other people keep told that my life is not the worst and I can agree. They can say the other one lives is worse than me, you at least have food, water, and a roof overhead, people from Africa are very poor, do you think about them? Yes, often think about poor people and that they need more help than me in fact I'm living very well in their background.

When I was a child I was thinking about writing a book about my life and write it when I will grow up, but now I don't find this idea very good. In fact, it's very stupid. I always feel stupid. Everyone thinks I'm stupid, retarded, or something. And I can kinda agree with them.

And I can't help myself because something will stop me and made feel me even worse and no one can help me. Every time I want to make animation, website, or whatever my programs got crashed, light turn off for the whole house, I lost internet connection, I got lost files or even worse corrupted because it most painful and any possible way to stop me from working that you can imagine.

I know odd people that sometimes can come from nowhere and write something odd. Something about eggs, something about fursuits while why do I in the world even want to know the cost of this? I don't hear you for months and you come back and say interesting how much fursuit is a cost or even ""docking"", various sort of things. There were only people that I talked with for like 5 months. I feel so terrible. For some things, I feel like I was raped and I don't even kidding.

First of all, I gonna say why I have a time limit, there a lot of reasons for that. I don't sure about what I should begin, but the current status that I'm suffering from Bullies, of my Family, of my Government, and what is going on in my country.

I tried to find transgender friends in Russia, but then I realized that it's an almost impossible challenge since most of them not just dressing and do other staff. Even when I saw an infinite number of almost always gross people I find the right thing, but even there I find bad people. One of them was younger than me he was 15 years old and then after a long conversation he said that he gives jobs to his boyfriend and do such things and send me some images, I try to change his mind, but he doesn't want to listen to me, he just enjoy that. And other transgenders I found were good people, but they weren't sure if they were transgender, but it still better than nothing. They never called me a friend in fact when I asked, they answer that we, not friends. And it broke my heart... I realized that I never had friends.

I scared to start to speak with anyone. When I don't speak everything usually better. So I can't say even a single word. 

Almost every night I have a nightmare about someone is trying to catch me and I trying to escape. It could be everything and mainly I ran in deserted places even if there should be a lot of people in them. The alternative ending is the screamer version so I can't even run for a while before screamer, I instantly got caught. Also there another type of dream where I walking on familiar but very changed places, most scary that before it had many people, but since every dream there less and fewer people, and everything got weirder and weirder, so everything change, even more, some building is destroying random big holes that always in random place start appear, world start to less looking to real and more have strange odd colors. I walking alone in an odd and scary world and getting die every time. The third type of dream is when I can't help someone, someone died and everything, recently I have only this type of dream.

I need to notice that I'm MtF transgender. I notice it that late because I still scared. I want to escape from this endless nightmare, start a new life from a blank page, and finally be myself. But looking at others' lives gives me a thing. I can't complain about this. A lot of people living even worse than me. 

I never talk to a psychotherapist because I was always scared to know to door or just make an appointment. But it has almost no sense, I'll just break my life forever by visiting a psychotherapist because there's almost no way to apply for a job because no one gonna takes a person who visited a psychotherapist. And most of them transphobes, so they gonna hurt me. The other one can't help me since the government looking for rights from transgenders.

I stuck in a circle of self-harm and writing a suicide note. I don't even strong enough to write this post, it was a nightmare for me. And I need to escape this country as fast as I can, because I can't take it any longer, people like me gonna die there.

I say almost nothing about I got bullied on the internet every day or how my government is worst in the world, I tired and you should know that I don't fully talk even about parents, friendship themes.

I feel like a bug without limbs that can't move and do something. Everyone else can draw, programming, make music, and basically anything else. I can't do anything everything that I made is just awful. My poems, lyrics for songs, my site...

I hate the way I look. I can't look in the mirror. I think I'm fat, I hate my voice, I hate how tall I am, I hate my haircut, I hate that I can't control my life, My face and whole body, The way I talk, The way I write. I want to have HRT and control my life so much.

I can't stand for myself and no one can. I can't help myself and no one can.

Everything I can do is repeatedly dying every day. And trying to not kill me. I didn't do anything to deserve all of this. I didn't do anything wrong. 

I forgot to notice that my mom is a transphobe. She said that these people should be in a mental hospital, or better on an island where no one can see them, or even better burn them all!...

I need your help I ask you to find a way to help me! I can't live here anymore, I need to get out.

This is terrible...

Please, help me survive...",06Aug2020,1
141,"From the beginning, this year has been terrible for me. I was so dumb back then that I made mistakes knowingly and took some real bad decisions. And just when I finally understood how it all works, 2020 it gave me a brutal punch right on the face. Yes, I broke my right femur in a road traffic accident in Feb. Prior to which I had just joined my new job on 31st Jan after being unemployed for like 2 months straight. I was having debt then which now has grown bigger. I had zero money when the accident happened so my family they asked money from our relatives and they paid for the Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF) surgery which got me a titanium rod in my right femur. I remember that right after the 5 hours surgery I cheered and told the doctors that, I am gonna bring sweets for them and all the staff members (who were so generous and helpful) once I get back on my feet! 

What really inspired me after that was nothing but the titanium rod inside! 🤩 Yes, I was feeling like I'm the Wolverine who just got titanium inside him and nothing can stop me now!! So after straight 6 weeks rest I got up and trained so hard, pushed my limits, did physio all by my own in my dad's old treadmill which even got broke due to constant training, I made my right leg strong with all the ligaments and muscles nicely aligned to kick a football hard just like before. ⚽️ Yes, I play football Ima Messi fan and take long, powerful shots! 

Nevertheless, I am still giving job interviews, no luck yet. I have like odd $900 debt on my head which gives me real bad thoughts sometimes like suicidal yeah. 🤯 But I have this strong feeling that I will make it. And I'm gonna make it one day!",06Aug2020,1

I 24(F) tend to constantly put myself down in front of all my friends, colleagues and my boyfriend 26(M). I tend to think of it as a coping mechanism- if I already tell them I think of myself poorly then they’ll not form that opinion on their own, or think it themselves. I’ll always crack self deprecating jokes (which seems like something most people do, but I take it to a whole new level). 
This has caused tensions in my relationship. My boyfriend now truly believes that I’m inferior to him and not worthy of him. He has started to exert dominance over me and acts like he’s stuck in this relationship and can leave anytime. We have been together for 2 years. While I had noticed this before I always passed it off as a playful joke, but after my friends raised alarms I decided to take this to reddit. I suffer from low self esteem problems. He knows about this and we’ve had several discussions about this too. Yet he hurts my feelings by making mean comments which are disguised as jokes. (About my intelligence, job, salary, looks and personality) I have put myself down on every aspect he brings up as a joke. 
I feel responsible somehow as I have drilled it into his head that I’m not worthy of him and that I’m not good at anything. I just need to know if I’m in the wrong here so that I can make a decision on whether or not to continue with this relationship. 
I would love some advice on this. Also some tips to improve self esteem would be great!",06Aug2020,1

Okay so I’ve had depression, anxiety and god knows what else.. for about 4 years now. The problem is every-time I have a depressive episode( which is every other week) I can’t bring my self to eat whilst feeling low, I have to wait till I start to feel happy again. The thought of food going near my mouth makes me feel nauseous, I have actually lost weight in the past because of this and recently became happy with my body as I’ve gained it back. 

Anyway... after a recent depressive episode I have not been able to eat since and the sight of food makes me tear up, I don’t want to eat! It’s like my body gets hungry but my mind doesn’t? I can literally go the whole day with out eating anything and it’s gotten to the point where I don’t even feel hungry anymore. I know this is going to lead to another depressive episode as this is going to cause me to lose weight again.

Is this an eating disorder or not ?",06Aug2020,1
145,"My now ex bf recently went on vacation with a few others. I didnt want to go but I trusted him to be able to go with other unfamiliar females. He ended up calling me to break up. 
Come to find out the first day he was flirting with her and slept in the same bed. He only f*cked her after we broke up. It was the same day still. 

To me this is cheating. He made up his mind to get with someone els while we where still together. He even spent a few days with her at my house continuing to sleep with and flirt till she left. (She was staying at our house for a week)

146,"Let me start by saying that I am not a grammar Nazi and make mistakes all the time, however there is one specific thing that my boss does that drives me crazy. I'm a personal assistant and often times I type things like emails for her because she's old and technologically challenged. She always has me capitalize words that she deems important even if it's not grammatically correct and I CAN'T S STAND IT. For example if she wants to tell someone to call her in the morning and wanted to emphasized ""morning"", she would write ""Call me in the Morning"". Morning should not be capitalized. If you want to emphasize then use bold, italics, or underline. It's not a proper noun or anything so it shouldn't be capitalized. And she does this ALL THE TIME. It's like every other sentence or at least 5-8 times per email. She's pretty old though and also my boss so I don't want to be disrespectful by correcting her, but also it's a little unprofessional in my opinion.

151,"Man, it seems like it's become real easy for me to dislike or even hate a large percentage of people in this country in recent years. I used to think that we should always try to treat people with some basic level of dignity, even if a person is on the wrong side of thinking things.

However, with all the events that have happened this year so far, it has greatly lessened my patience on humanizing other people. Especially all the attacks by anti-maskers on workers or police on protesters. In the past it's been extremely frustrating to see all the damage people are inflicting on the world through their actions no matter how big or small, regular folks or politicians. Surely I'm not the only person that doesn't want things to go bad? 

But apparently other people seem so inclined in taking the country on a self-destructive path, one that is next to impossible to escape from. This inability to do anything myself or people's lack of willingness to change things for the better almost makes me okay seeing things go bad. If people really want this ship to burn, then fine, let things burn. You'll drown last with no one left to blame but yourself, if you are even mentally capable of that self-assessment. 

Overall I'm grateful that I can work from home and that things are going well still for me, but it gets tiring seeing with this constant harmful cycle day after day.",06Aug2020,1

The pressure in my chest immediately vanished! It was easy for me to keep that heart rate now. Idk what finally allowed me to do it but boy am I happy about it!

159,"Hey Reddit, in the last year or so I've tried really hard to make friends, both nearby for real life meetups and redditors further afield. It's gone great and I've now got a few people I hang out with at home, in parks, in the pub etc to have long deep and meaningful conversations. I count these people as true friends, rather than passing acquaintances, and I do feel lucky at knowing them. Of course some people online do ghost, but I now have a core group of a few friends who'll be there for me and I know won't just drop out. We're solid.

The problem is that it feels like it's always me starting a conversation. Note that I don't annoy people by saying boring repetitive things like ""hey how are you?"" every morning or anything like that, but I'll ask what they're up to, whether that thing they were talking about doing went ok, or tell them something fun I've done. You know: normal friendly banter. I like letting people know I'm thinking of them, right? It just feels like I seldom get any of that in return. Nobody ever spontaneously asks how I am, or tells me something funny out of the blue: only as part of an ongoing texting conversation chain.

I know everyone has busy lives; they're likely texting, phoning and meeting other people just as I am; lots of people are trying to step away from their phones a bit more lately; people sometimes have grumpy unsociable weeks etc etc. I get that. Also, I give people space and time, and never pester them or be needy. However sometimes I wish that people would make more of an effort for me. Again, I'm comfortable enough with my true friends not to be upset if I don't hear from them for a week or so. That's how you know it's a real friend: you can go months or years sometimes between talking with old friends and that's absolutely fine. I'd just like for them to pop up out of the blue sometimes to say hey, rather than it being me all the time. I hope that makes sense. Any advice would be much appreciated!",06Aug2020,1

Oh wait, I know why. It’s because they didn’t think I was depressed. They thought I was sad. They thought I was gonna be fine in a couple of days. They didn’t realize that behind the scenes I feel physical pain in my chest and head because of the emotional distress that I feel. They didn’t know how I have to fight the urge to self harm every day. They didn’t know how my family didn’t care about me so I had to struggle against suicidal thoughts completely alone for nearly two years. They didn’t know the guilt I feel for not being a complete person - for not being able to be at my best for everyone else. They didn’t understand how much I genuinely hate myself. 

And then they realized I wasn’t getting better. Despite the meds and the therapy, I was slipping back into where I was before. I was trying so hard. But my mind is too broken. I didn’t get better. And then they realized I was too much work. They realized I was bad for them. They realized that they could just make other friends who were better than me. As I neglected myself to try and be a good friend to others, they moved on. They didn’t need or want me. I was just the disposable, mentally ill “friend”. 

That’s why all my friends stopped caring.",06Aug2020,1
