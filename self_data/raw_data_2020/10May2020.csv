0,"Every single year on Mother’s Day my dad guilt trips us and makes it out as if we’re ungrateful for everything my mom does for us. My mom is amazing, don’t get me wrong, but my dad essentially expects us to be her servants for the day and if we’re anything less he gets passive aggressive at best, straight up shaming us at worst. My mom has made it clear that she really doesn’t care that much but nonetheless she can do something as simple as getting herself a snack out of the pantry and my dad will turn to us and be like “why didn’t you get that snack for her”. I remember one particular year when I was in high school and we were getting ready to go to church on Mother’s Day and I asked where we were going to eat afterwards (because I was a *teenager* and already thinking about lunch) and somehow he took it as a selfish remark and was scolding me being like “it’s not about you” and the rest of the day was just hell because of that stupid interaction. Last year, I actually got my mom a gift, not because I felt pressured by my bad, but because I actually wanted to and I had the money. I got her a bunch of bath and body works stuff in a new scent she had been eyeing and spent almost $50 and my dad still guilt tripped me all day. This year, as much as I want to get her something, I can’t because with covid-19 I’ve been furloughed from my job, the unemployment office in my state has been dragging ass so I’m still impatiently waiting on my unemployment checks, and since I’m a dependent adult I don’t get the stimulus check. Basically I don’t have a drop of income, but I know my dad will likely twist it to seem like I just didn’t care to do anything for her. My dad actually started on the passive aggressive comments yesterday. I’m really dreading tomorrow, and I’m contemplating just not even coming out of my room for the whole day because right now in particular I’ve just been in a perpetual state of moodiness (caused by either my shitty quarantine diet or this new generic brand of my birth control they put me on) and one of those comments is bound to push me over the edge and I don’t need that to happen. It actually already happened today which is why I’m even making this post. I just don’t feel like guilt tripping is the way to make your kid appreciate their mom, and it’s especially problematic to continue doing that when your kid is an adult. I really just needed to say this, and I said it here because if I confronted my dad about it, he would of course twist it to seem like I’m just ungrateful.",10May2020,1
1,So basically my school gives me a fair amount of school work at the moment but the issue is that some of the teachers  are not sending any at all and any attempt at trying to communicate with them and hopefully work something out ends in a rude response and being called irresponsible for not taking care of it before the whole covid stuff.I don’t really mind doing extra work but at this point I’m being stressed out about not getting any work at all and about my grades being disappointing.Anyways I’d really appreciate if someone shared any tips on how to relieve stress because no thing is working so far.,10May2020,1

9,"Rise and Fall........... Rise again?

I’d like to tell you a story. 

The year is 1998 and a young man who grew up in a situation where week days you live in a fatherless , drug infested home where my mother had one man after another which some chose to not only beat her but beat me as well. The weekends I was blessed to spend time with my Grandparents, culture and love were abound and then Sunday night back to the grind. Grandpa dies when I’m 12 and grandma did not have it in her to continue having me around at the level they did as a team. I love them both and thank them for showing me another side of life. 


“The Rise”
Fast forward, I’m in and out of juvenile hall and county jail till I end up in state Prison. December 7th 1998 I’m free and now 24 years old and my older sister takes me in and I start to piece my life together, work starts at $6.75 an hour. Very labor intensive, I worked hard , I watched the best do there jobs, I did what I was told and yet I stood up for myself. Funny note, my sister got me the job through her then boyfriend, now husband and father to her 3 beautiful children. I mentioned them because I remember one day they told me I would never go anywhere with this particular company , funny part is is that I rose up quicker than he, within 8 years I’m a store manager, Manager of The Year, multiple store records and making over $200K a year. From $6.75 an hour to $200K a year. I was the man, we now had the house, the cars, the friends , the money. 


“The Fall” 
I was great at my job. Me and my wife loved people and people loved us. We were quickly and consistently finding ourselves hanging with the “Higher Ups” and it turned ugly fast. Ugly situations I was put in. My boss, my bosses wife we were the closest to, trusted and loved them. One day they tell us that Divorce is coming and we were heart broken. Then my bosses boss who I’m also friends with comes to me , why fucking me? And tells me he is having an affair with my bosses wife? WTF? Now me and my wife are in the middle of something I don’t need, the stress was rough. I immediately told my boss who let me know he knew. So now that he knows me and my wife knows we now consistently are here for him to vent, while I work, he comes and vents, “Meet me for a beer” to vent, call my wife almost every fucking day and add that to her plate and VENT. We did not deserve or ask for this on top of the high stress job I performed. Ok, that most would say was bad enough, but it gets worse. My boss has a guy under him that’s also my boss, we hung out with them as well,  Casinos in different states, drinking , drinking, drinking. Me and my wife were so there for them and we thought they were there for us. It is now shared with us that him and his wife had a threesome with our bosses wife on a Vegas trip we went together on. WTF? Why , more stress, these people gave 0 fucks about the mess they put me in, this affected me so much at work and no one gave a shit. When my personal and professional life starts to suffer it’s all my fault. I was having a hard time being held accountable from people I lost respect for. I had a mental breakdown, my marriage was on the rocks because me and my wife were both being affected by this. No one cares. I quit! A 19 year loyal , manager of the year, well respected and looked up to part of our company. Quit, no one calls me, no one tries, I’m replaced faster then you can say “ what the fuck “. I became extremely depressed, I did not have a father around, I looked up to these guys as father and big brother figures. I blew my savings over the last 3 years chasing happiness, but here I sit. This continues to weigh on me, I’m struggling to let this go. Here  I am still dealing with THEIR actions while they all still have their positions, living their best lives. 
I DID NOT ASK FOR THIS!

I started my own small business and it’s opportunity looks to be amazing.  I need to move past “The Fall” but I can’t seem to. Where do I go from here?

Me: Double click it.

18,"I’ve had forms of panic attacks a few times due to being high from weed and one claustrophobia-induced panic attack, but this was the first time I’ve just been going through so many that my mind just gave out. 

My day went like this:
No sleep, did some the day before
Left my apartment at 6am to go to work
Did my shift, all went pretty smoothly.
Got home. 
Had a falling out with a guy i hooked up with and hung out on different occasions. Some things were said to me that were disgusting and made me feel terrible about myself
Took a nap, got woken up 30 mins later by a phone call and didn’t go back to sleep. I woke up my heart feeling heavy
Been texting a guy I like a lot for a long time about plans to meet up soon. We’re probs just gonna be friends though so it’s no relationship oriented, but our convo weighed on my mind a lot today
Took a shower
Made dinner and took an antibiotic I have to take
Took another, longer nap. Went to sleep feeling almost sick and woke up to my heart feeling heavy

BOOM
Panic attack. I called the guy I like and he talked to me for 45 mins. He’s a psych major and I feel calm with him in general. He walked me thru it and I couldn’t have asked for a someone better to help me.

It finally settled down, and I’ve been relaxing ever since. 

To people who deal with this more often, I’m so sorry. This shit fucking sucks. My heart still feels exhausted from it. I feel like I was gonna have to go to the hospital for them to save my life before I died. I struggled with breathing and I was shaking and I eventually started crying. I progressively felt my heart getting more and more heavy and pounding more. I was terrified and called the guy I like. He help me so much with grounding myself and distracting myself.

At first they broke up with me because of issues such as they said they never drove me and i never saw a future with them at first I thought they were wrong and denied everything and that we belonged together and I really ment it but then they said we shouldn’t be together. During the week of not talking i took some time to look at myself and realized i hadn’t been loving myself and i was in fact going nowhere and i felt i had been so focused on trying to find the one person  for me I never gave myself the time to properly grow up and try to find a career. I decided i need to move and find a new job and start fresh which i am (starting next week) and apparently this whole “breakup” was for me to see their worth and decided i want them back. I told my them my plans and they were understanding at first but as weeks go by they tell me they miss me and i ran away from the relationship.

30,"1º You will die no matter what and the Universe eventually too so every action, feeling and thought will vanish into nothingness and even the memory of it too. This is actually a very positive point because it means you're totally free.

2º Life is about cycles of happiness-depression. So, eventually your current happiness/depression will be compensated with the opposite, like a rollercoaster with different stories/context but all with the same essence. This means it all ends up being neutral but let's consider that, if you die, you're preventing all future suffering from happening and we all know what old age is all about: sickness and pain till death.

3º Exploration. We actually don't know what's in the other side. It's probably the same thing there was before we were born: nothing; but maybe its not and it may be interesting to risk that possibility, especially if your current situation is not interesting or very painful. 

4º Ego-death. The voice inside your mind mya be pure torture and suicide would end that. I know what is to trip on psychedelics and how those chemicals allow your inner voice to dissolve into everything, getting a god-like perspective in the sense of ""becoming everything""/""eliminating all boundaries between your notion of self and the rest of the universe. There's the theory that near death experiences release DMT so you may get a nice trip just before everything ends.

I would also like to send my sincerest condolences to anyone who has experienced the death of a close friend or relative due to covid-19. With that said, personally it has caused me to be the happiest I’ve ever been in a very long time. For the past 6+ years I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression and during this past school year my depression  reached an all-time-high. I was at the point of contemplating suicide almost daily and feeling any type of “happy” was extremely rare, however, my immense fear of death was always what stopped me. Once quarantine hit and schools started to close, I also got laid off. I  had all the time in the world to study and finished with a near perfect semester (mostly As and a few A+s) and once exams were done I was able to officially devote all of my time to self care. I began listening to my body and it’s needs, it was a slow process but I got into yoga and that’s what helped me the most. I am able to free my mind with breathing exercises and after following a few YouTube yoga lessons I’ve found a passion for the art and always feel so much love for myself afterwards.

I am a software engineer born and raised in North Carolina. I get a good salary here, but I don't enjoy my life. I spent six months last year living in France, and I fell in love with being in the old world. I found it very easy to make friends and enjoy little things in life. However, here, I don't feel this way. What has held me back has been that I have been extremely close to my family, and they are all concentrated here. However, I have lately grown distant, so I've had no one in my life really. I remember how happy I was abroad, and I realize I was less lonely thousands of miles away than I am here.

Here is a father to my half-brother. A father my brother never had, who loved my brother as his own.

Here is a protector who made me feel safe, who let me feel no fear, even with our local gangsters threatening us and creeps coming by the house all the time in my childhood.

Yesterday I received a message that a big Japanese clothing company likes my pictures and my chose of clothing. They sell streatwear and I actually liked it.

I don't trust this. No one sends such messages on instagram. I know that I don't have an email there or something but doing it all over Instagram does not seem legit to me.

Anyways, they want me to model for them and them being basically my sponsors. I would love the idea and it got to my head pretty hard since yesterday.

I mean the company has a lot of followers and they don't seem bought since they also comment. I still don't belive that they would make something like that over ig.

I wrote them anything they need from me: name, camera model, my favorite chose of clothes. They also send me a message with everything I would receive from this. Till now they did not want any private info or any credit card numbers.

This is the first time in years I feel like I actually matter to the world. I know I have a wife and kids but I never thought that I would be a potential model or something. Even if that's not legit, I felt humbled.",10May2020,1

The only solution is to wipe it off my face before anyone sees.",10May2020,1
60,"Hi r/self. First post here, but I think it’s an interesting one.

So I was helping my dad out gardening yesterday and cutting the lawn. It was a sunny day and so I didn’t have much except some shorts and a T-shirt on. I like listening to music while mowing the lawn, so I had my phone tucked in my shirt with Bluetooth headphones connected to it.

When I was finishing up, my dad asked me to drive the lawnmower to a gate beside our house so his brother can use it. I said sure and drove it up. Once I drove it up to the gate, I got off and couldn’t find my phone. I looked around the ground and realized i had put it in my pocket before driving the lawnmower to the gate, and my shorts pockets are kinda shit.

It fell out while I was driving it. So I went back down the way I drove, and looked on the ground. I couldn’t see it. I made it back to where my dad was at. He was burning some rotten wood, and I saw him messing around with his pike. He picked out my phone and managed to take the case off.

If I wasn’t an idiot enough already for dropping the phone in while driving past the fire, I went to pick it up and burnt my thumb. Luckily I realized quite rapidly that plastic which has just been in the fire is very hot, so I only burnt my thumb and not too badly.

The phone was on the ground, but not burning. It was hot to the touch. I waited around, talking to my dad and we both agreed it was fucked. I had kind of already accepted that, and was upset only because I had some nice pictures on there that I hadn’t uploaded anywhere else. Eventually it cooled down, and I pressed the home button and by some miracle it went to the home screen. The screen was a bit charred but upon inspection it was only a bit of plastic from the case and I managed to wipe it off. The case left some more marks on the phone, where the battery port and headphone jack go.

I brought it in and cleaned it up, and there’s only a bit of damage to the physical phone at the bottom where some of the actual phone burned, but it’s barely noticeable. By some miracle, it charges and nothing so far seems damaged. In fact I’m using it to write this story right now. The only minor issue I had encountered was the speakers not working, until I figured out that for some reason it considered that there were headphones plugged in, even if there weren’t.

I cleaned the headphone jack, and fiddled around with the settings which eventually fixed it. The case was burnt to a crisp after it happened, but I think that’s what absorbed a majority of the damage. Plus my dad being there to notice there was something burning in there that didn’t look like rotting wood :p

Overall I think I used up all my luck for the year.",10May2020,1
61,"I have been in love with the sport for 2 years now, but I only play it over the summer and in PE when I get the chance. 

Over the summer the place is usually crowded with like 20 30 people always wanting to play, split into teams. Well, I have a decent jump, but no one wants to set me up for a spike ever, I assume because I often miss the spike and the ball is too weak. 

Yesterday, the usual spiker wasn't ready for it and I reacted quickly, jumped for it and made an awesome spike straight to the ground. Sorry if it feels like a brag, but this was my first spike and it made others start setting me up for them more often, it looked awesome and it was unexpected! I'm so happy.",10May2020,1

67,"My stepdad passed away 3 days ago. 

My biological parents got divorced around 6 years ago, and that was the last time I've seen my real father. He used to mentally and physically abuse me and my mom, you could easily see that I hate him. 

Later on, my mom got married to my step-dad. When I hugged him, I've got an unique feeling and couldn't hold back my tears. He was so warm and kind to me and even though we had ups and downs, he was the perfect father/role model that I was looking for since I was 5 years old. 

He died at the hospital because of a heart attack that started at our house (his heart had stopped at our place), doctors say that it was massive and if he could survive he wouldn't be able to use his body functions.

I burried him. To see him in a burial robe was the worst. I couldn't understand how a person with such a big mind and heart would fit into that coffin.

His family wanted to burry him in another city but when we get back home with my mom, there will be nothing but memories of him. We'll move out, probably.

The day before his death, we were having some tiffs so I wasn't really talking to him and I wasn't leaving my room at all. The day he died, his footsteps made me wake up when he got in my room to borrow a blanket to have a nap. That was the first and last time I've seen him in that day. 
It hurts so much that I couldn't tell him that how much I love him. It hurts. I wish I could hug him one last time. It sucks that I don't have a father and my best friend anymore. 
I'm only fifteen and I'll turn sixteen in May 25th. I used to dream that he'd see my highschool and university prom, that he'd see my marriage and my kids.
I also wanted to do everything that my real father couldn't do with me.
Nobody's hug can make me feel like his anymore.
I miss him so much.

There's one more thing I want to say.

Please say 'I love you' to the people that you care about and love, hug them tightly and do it before its too late.

74,"So I like this guy. “Like” may be an understatement, but to seem a little cool, I’m gonna leave it at that. 

This guy is son of a really close family friend family. Our family and theirs have been tight before I was even conceived. I always was around him but I hadn’t ever developed feelings. They’re family consists of 4 guys and I was pretty close to the eldest one, he was super chill. But suddenly we just stopped talking. However, this is another completely different story. I’m not on bad terms with any of the brothers. I say hello and bye when I see them and vice versa. 

The guy I have developed feelings for is the youngest one, he’s smart, athletic and overall just attractive. But he’s the one I talk to the least. Just occasional hellos and byes. 

Mind you, our families are arabs but we live in the west. So semi arranged marriages are very common. And I want an “arranged marriage” with him...

He’s mom is like QUEEN BEE. She gets the final say. 

BUT THIS IS THE PROBLEM
THE PROBLEM IN THIS WHOLE THING

I stopped going to their families house. I just didn’t like the atmosphere lately and I’ve just stopped. This is very offensive to his mom and my mom gets really angry because she considers this as being disrespectful. I was really close to his mom, like really close. To the point where she would buy me outfits and I would borrow some of her clothes because her fashions bomb. I honestly love that woman but sometimes I get a little tired. Since I’ve stopped really interacting, it’s become awkward and I think she maybe offended. 

If this continues, and I want to get married to him, I’m scared she’ll object and stop the whole thing. 

I don’t know what to do. Should I start talking to his mom again and suck up to her or should I continue not being around her anymore.??",10May2020,1

There are some rants and unfortunately even incel-ish submissions as well but yeah mostly love letter. I know it doesn’t really correlate with me whatsoever but it just makes me feel kinda down. Like, it just makes it more real that society, especially in my environment as university students, really care about looks.

78,"So we had been friends for a while, I really enjoyed hanging out with him, but he never texted me first or asked me to hangout, he would cancel on me to hang out with other people, we talked about it, I said that he needed to text me first, ask me to spend time with him, and not cancel on me to be with other people unless it’s a really big deal (because that shit hurts), and if he didn’t, I would kick him out of my life for good. He agreed to it, he did text me here and there, which was nice, but was always too busy to come over. So once this pandemic hit we just texted, I organised to call on some days, but he would always cancel or delay, saying he would call me later in the week, but never did. He’s stopped texting me as much, convos are shorter, until he hasn’t even read my texts, he has never answered my calls, he said he was taking a break from social media (which he hasn’t been online on Instagram for a while) but a goddamn phone call, A PHONE CALL, was all I wanted, to talk to him, see what he’s been up to, we haven’t spoken in two weeks, and before that the conversations were very short as he just stopped responding.

97,"This is gonna be long, please bear with me...

My (24f) crush (20m) is telling me that his depression is “making him shut off emotionally...” 

We met on Reddit about a month or so ago and he immediately started conversations with me, enjoyed talking to me, would take the initiative most of the time, and listened to me when I told him about how the last guy I liked treated me like shit. 

Obviously we are long distance, he lives in Canada and I’m in the US... He has family not too far from me and he said himself that he wanted to try and meet me “sometime soon” after c0r0nav!rus blows over. He said he loved me, it just slipped out, he even seemed a little embarrassed but it was sweet and genuine. We flirted hardcore and clearly liked each other, it became sexual but only after he made me feel loved, he told me I was cute and beautiful all the time, wanted to talk to me all the time, and I fell for him. He’s not even my “type” but his personality (to this point) was so great and he’s hilarious and genuine. He has the cutest laugh and smile. He makes me feel “seen” and he’s usually very emotionally intelligent. His family situation is a bit rough. He struggles with his mom who he said is verbally abusive, he lives with her. He said he’d rather live in the US with his dad but he can’t cross the border rn. 

He also said that not too long ago he broke up with his ex GF who he also met online and they were long distance. He called her a b!tch, which I thought was a red flag but I listened to him and he said she was manipulative and disrespectful. I understand that this affected him a lot which I respect...

He used to make me feel so wanted, beautiful, just happy, carefree, enjoy laughing and flirting with him, he even asked if I wanted to lose our virginities to each other (yes I know, so shocking that we’re both virgins by choice, mind you, in our 20’s... 🙄) 

I didn’t want to put a label on it or anything... but he said he loved me first... and it just made sense to me to ask after a week of that if I was his GF... he answered in a roundabout way that he wanted to wait and see what happened with the border situation, etc. I agreed and since I also recently broke up with a toxic boyfriend, I told him that it was ok. But that we can’t deny that we like each other either. 

We used to video call on Skype all the time, like multiple times a week. It’s not like he has a job or anything... he is a gamer, lol... usually I don’t even like gamers, but the bottom line is that he’s at home with just him and his mom, he has the whole basement to himself, and he has time to talk to me if he wanted. I’m sure of it. 

He has severe depression and anxiety. He drinks a lot, which I absolutely hate but I don’t want to judge him too harshly for that. He was clingy, sweet, loving, funny, happy, sensitive to how I was feeling... one time he almost made me cum with just his words while we were really getting into it... After a few times he started being selfish and would stop after he came, like not even continuing to try and get me off. I get that he’s immature and younger than me but it made me so upset. I have never been more sexually frustrated with anyone, and it seems absurd to me. I could find any guy on the internet to flirt with me and tell me I’m cute, I told him this but I want him, I like him, I love him... when I just couldn’t take it anymore I told him how I felt like he was essentially giving me the female equivalent of blue balls he didn’t really have a response. He said he loved me but that he’s not always in the mood. Which I fucking understand but it makes me so frustrated and I feel thrown for a loop... he knows how I’ve been treated like disposable shit by guys before him and he has reassured me several times that he won’t do that to me, that he’s just depressed... I miss the emotional closeness.. that’s what I need to feel sexual attraction to anyone, now that he’s “unlocked that” so so speak, I feel so angry and hurt and almost like he used me and manipulated me. Every time I tell him why I’m insecure about this because of how other guys have treated me, he get upset and says “nooo I’m not like that! Stop comparing me to them, I’m not a shitty guy...” But why do I feel shitty then!?

We haven’t video called and had a real conversation for a week and a half going on two weeks now. Friday night we did call but it was because he “felt like it” and I was doing homework, but I called him anyway. It was boring and not the same. 

He doesn’t call me beautiful, call me babe, etc anymore. He did that before I even told him I liked him. Now that he knows how I feel it seems like he doesn’t give a shit. 

He claims that he “needs time alone” when he’s feeling depressed. He claims that he’s always been like this. I asked him why he wasn’t like that two weeks ago when he wanted to essentially treat me like a girlfriend. He said he “doesn’t know” and won’t answer any of my questions clearly. He only can tell me that he “doesn’t want a relationship right now” and that he “needs alone time.” He won’t call me unless he “feels like it.” He will still message me and we can talk about boring insipid topics devoid of any emotion, but that’s it. 

He’s a night owl and he used to talk to me during the day and at a reasonable time of night. Now he expects me to stay up into the wee hours to message him on Skype or snap. I haven’t been sleeping well the past week because it makes me feel so shitty and I’m tired of waiting for the crumbs of his attention and affection when I’m here for him all the time, would listen to him whenever, and he knows I love him. 

I have all empathy for him that he’s depressed, I’ve been suicidal and depressed before myself... I don’t expect to call every day... I told him this. 

Last week he said he promised we’d call on a certain night. I was happy all that day because I was anticipating calling him. Later that night I asked when we’d call and he said he didn’t feel like it. I got so angry and just told him everything. He clammed up and said he “couldn’t handle it.” I told him not to make promises he couldn’t keep. He got angry, he didn’t reassure me, he said I was overreacting, etc. This kind of thing has happened about 3-4 times now. Each time he makes it about himself and how he “can’t handle it,” needs time alone, and how me telling him how I feel is just pushing him away more. 

I am trying so hard to let him take the lead. He will still message me first but it feels like the absolute bare minimum of effort. He said he “is beyond done with everything” and that he is isolating himself from everyone, and not just me.  I told him that I take his word for it that it’s his depression. But I’m not going to keep waiting around and torturing myself, begging for his attention and affection when he doesn’t want to give it or doesn’t feel it. It feels so unfair, like he’s a completely different person, his personality did a 180...

This sounds very teenagerish the more I write... I just needed to get this out and get some perspective. I completely understand how depression makes people feel like pure shit, I’ve been through it myself but I just don’t understand why he wouldn’t want to talk to me... It’s been like every day now. It makes me so infuriated and I feel selfish but I don’t want to beg for his attention. I don’t have emotional energy to waste. Maybe it’s just a waste of time, energy, and emotions at this point but I just feel like he completely fucking led me on and that he knew what he was doing, and shouldn’t have done it if he knew this might happen. This is why I feel like it’s an excuse. I don’t want to just be platonic friends with him. I feel like I’m going crazy.

TL;DR: the guy that says he loves me also says that his depression is making him emotionally unavailable, and that while he loves me, he doesn’t want a relationship. He won’t reassure me or be sweet to me like he once was. I don’t know if I should believe him that it’s his depression, it seems like an excuse to me.",10May2020,1

Today I have no creativity, today I have no energy, today I have no appetite, today I have no motivation, today I don’t want to process or talk through my feelings. Today is the day every symptom I’ve ever had collides together for the first time in my life. Today I don’t want to go outside and clear my head. Today I’m sitting in a dry bathtub just writing my thoughts before they turn violent. Today, I don’t want to die, I just want a break, because I’ve been fighting since day one.

Hello everyone! This is my first time posting something on this site: I always imagined that my first question would be exciting or interesting, something worth reading. Instead, it's my last attempt to understand why I am the way I am, why is my whole existence so shallow.

I'll turn eighteen in July, and by some unwritten rule I should be enjoying life, being free and careless, finding myself at the peak of the existential nirvana. Oh, those teenage years, they should be the best time of my life! And yet,the fatigue is irremediable:it has sucked everything in me and it never gets satisfied of me, it will feel it's fullness only when the earth will swallow me in a silent vortex, in the tranquility that perhaps I deserve. I don't really have someone that cares for me nor that would be upset about me disappearing. There are many things that I'm bitter about, that leave me with that 'what if' possibilities open. Sadly, I'll never know. This is the path that led me to write this post, to decide whether I should keep going or not.

Humans as a race crave interaction and were not made to be lonely. They're complex: emotions are necessary to build bonds and long-lasting relationships. According to Freud, however, the origin of social feelings is to be found in the feeling of jealousy that has as its object the mother and that opposes the brothers between them. When each one realizes that he cannot prevail over the others, he fights for at least equality of all and domination of one. Freud therefore believes that social justice means giving up a lot so that others too can give it up. This demand for equality,forms the root of social consciousness and a sense of duty. See? We all have different points of view when it comes to nearly anything. Now close your eyes. What do you see? I see the mountains. Covered by a thick layer of snow. The snow shines in the sun. The frost pinches my cheeks, and I'm happy. Let's organize the snowball fight. Some create snowmen, others instead, sip hot chocolate and laugh when we are hit by a snowball. This is what I want. I think we all want it. And what do you see? In fact, give me a moment. Just enough time to finish, okay? Then I'll make you talk.

Take another breath. Take as much fresh air into your lungs as possible. As if it was your last breath.

I am surrounded by a sense of peace and tranquility. Silence. And what do you feel? Silence, bliss, fear? It's difficult to tell, but I can perceive your confusion through the screen. Now restart the tape: the truth is that I don't feel anything. What I have described is just an idealized image that comes to mind in front of the word 'happiness', although I myself am not able to live it. I live a monotonous reality that flows before my eyes, without me being able to grasp it. Actually, I don't even live. I only exist. I imitate what I see to fit into what surrounds me because I do not have the strength or the ability to experience true feelings; I am not interested in creating solid relationships, healthy friendships and this throws me into a depressing spiral of loneliness. I don't particularly mind the latter, reading takes up most of my time, otherwise I sleep. It's as if I'm in a limbo, in the middle of nothing that stimulates me. I just simply don't care. This boring interlude of NOTHINGNESS is sometimes interrupted by my incredible narcissism and self-worship. Other times, however, this almost divine vision that I created of myself is non-existent. I try to be interested in something, to find myself a hobby, but every single thing occupies my concentration for a week at most. Why do others really live? Why can't I really live too? Why does my mind swing so much?

I have so little time available. I am not interested in living for other long years in this way. My psyche burns, my eyeballs are also burning: I would tear them away with my bare hands if I could. I don't care if this rotten monologue will be buried by other posts. Au revoir, mes amis! La nuit est longue.",10May2020,2

120,"TL:DR Male in early 30s unloading my shit for catharsis and hopefully some direction. Suggestions for a not quite a recluse with no social ties or interpersonal history welcomed.

No social relationships. Nor familial bar an intermittent one with my father - due to my typically being elsewhere more than any friction.

Split with my partner of 5 years in November. Entirely cut off. She was effectively my social life, her social circle, her friends. Turns out she got engaged to someone pretty much immediately after which struck like a sandbag.

We lived together in a van for most of that time. On her decision to end it we stayed together a few weeks as I rushed to buy another van enjoying the relative isolation and cheapness of living / responsibility. I've found out since that it is entirely rust underneath. Wasted 5 grand there for 4 months of living. 20 grand somehow disappeared in the last few months of our relationship, I'm not entirely sure where, so I'm now on a shoestring budget I can't expand via working as CV19. Returned to a town full of memories of my ex to care for my father in the current climate as he's infected. Van MOT expires in two weeks. Not sure why that hasn't been extended, irrespective of it obviously not being safe to drive. Unable to find another car or van as can't travel. I want to stay in a van and convert it myself as I like the project concept, ominous as it may be - I'd planned to visit my father for a couple of weeks and do the conversion in early April. That went to hell as I can't inspect anything or get the materials from stores /delivered.

Pretty obvious I'm autistic in some form - although tested and denied as I'm apparently too good with my social interactions. The process was ridiculous however - misspelled signs and missing pins in the waiting room, correspondence inverted and badly written with incorrect data. Flat affect certainly rings true - I feel things very deeply but don't show them. I don't get angry or process any negative emotions. Not even the death of my mother a few years ago, just some residual guilt there which I don't actually feel bad for.

I operate best in small social circles, especially having one person to be a focus as a partner. I'm definitely more of a support role. I've no ambition or desires of my own. I used to want to write, but needing silence to focus I'd type at night, which my ex had me stop. I can't pick it up again as I hear every sound around me my father and the neighbours make - another aspect of favouring vanlife - which disrupts me as I have a compulsion to narrate and speak - in my mind - everything said and heard around me.

I waste most of my time now reading, playing games, and making terrible attempts to find a new partner. I used to drive to isolated spots and listen to podcasts, opening up the van to look at country fields as I wrote or drank. 

No one speaks to me. I have no one to speak to. Before my ex, I'd planned to disappear after my father died. Traveling somewhere until I run out of money and life in search of a purpose or place to be.

I've a low oxygenation in my blood which disqualifies me from the medical tests I've applied for to try and at least be of use with my disregard for myself. I've looked for jobs which may be psychologically challenging for other more normative personalities. Anything where my preference of being alone and lack of concern for my well-being could be channeled to an actual use, but have yet to find anything with a role available.

I'm not overly suicidal, or depressed, I'm just realistic in my assessment of things and awareness of my own foibles and inclinations. 

Any suggestions for studies or roles that would benefit from my situation - able to travel anywhere, current world not withstanding - and no commitment outside of a job I'm currently unable to perform would be welcomed.

I'm UK based, roughly around Northampton, although the upcoming homeless situation means I can be anywhere as it's simple enough to rent a room, again in a normal world.

 Again, this isn't a suicide note. I'm just looking for external perspectives and suggestions on ways to engage myself. Despite haemorrhaging funds at the end of the relationship I have enough saved again to buy a second hand car or van, or finance a new one, assuming my lack of any credit history isn't an issue. I'm sure I could stay with my father indefinitely as well, although my tentative sanity is unlikely to stay with me if I do.",10May2020,1
122,"First, I’m gonna start by saying this is a throwaway account, as I’m not ready to tell my boyfriend these words yet. Not to mention I don’t have anyone I can talk to about this. 
I am in the process of recovering from an eating disorder. This illness has not only taken a toll on my mental stability, but my boyfriend and I’s sex life. I often find that I can’t bare to be touched, looked at, or motioned to in any type of sexual manner. I hate my body a lot, and I can no longer look in the mirror without wanting to relapse again. Knowing this, my boyfriend often does all of those things, and sometimes it makes me very emotional but, it’s also something i need to do, to become more comfortable in my body. I know intimacy isn’t forbidden in our relationship, and I love holding him, it’s just when his hand wanders that I get insecure. It’s not his fault, that part is my head. Today though, something was off. I wanted to try sex again, and usually when I offer myself to my boyfriend he’s always quick to act, but he refused. That left my confidence down, but i understand not wanting to have sex, because those are my thoughts 24/7, but that’s not usual for him. I was just spiraling in thoughts though when i realized that he was acting on my offer to which caused me to then spiral further. Next thing I know I had to stop everything because I just couldn’t stop crying. I felt so awful and ashamed. My boyfriend was so nice about it and was trying to help but I didn’t even know what was going on myself. Since that happened I can’t pull myself to look at him or even talk about the situation. I still don’t know the situation, I just started crying. I just hope this feeling goes away soon though.

Sorry for any errors in my grammar.",10May2020,0
124,"I keep playing myself

I am currently seeing a therapist for this issue because it affected my mental health pretty terribly...I just want other opinions. 

I am (19F) I always get into this situation where I have a “thing” with someone and they act like they really like me at first and then they are no longer interested and in worse case scenarios, get into a serious relationship with someone else. In between that I always try really hard to keep them interested. I have never been in a proper relationship. 

Throughout 2019 I played myself terribly and it’s affected me to this day. I met someone on tinder. He was amazing at first and showed so much interest. He became my first kiss and we went on 2 dates. He told me a few weeks after the second date (after acting dry and ghosting me for a bit) that he “wasn’t ready for a relationship”.

And this is the part where “playing myself” comes in...

He started to reach out a few weeks later. I kept ignoring but gave in at that point. We kept talking for a whole month straight, best friends on Snapchat and all. He even gave me false hope he wanted to see me again as I was trying to get my drivers license at the time and kept suggesting that I should “pick him up” when I get them (he has his license btw). I ended up ghosting him because he was acting dry and leaving me on delivered whilst being active on social media. I failed that test and reached out to him a month later to make myself feel better. 

Then he started to get pissed off at me because I was posting and reposting break up quotes on Facebook and he knew they were to do with him. He asked me “why I cared about him so much” and from that time on I didn’t want to talk to him anymore, I thought it was the end...

Until August when we bumped into each other at a club and I kissed him. I ended up telling him I was a virgin and he knew I was waiting for a relationship to lose it. I wish I never told him that. He told me he wanted to “see me again” over and over again. He then ghosted me and super liked my best friend on tinder and tried to ask her out. She told him he wasn’t nice to me and he told her I was “twisting sh*t”. 

I spent pretty much the entire year being invested in this person who now I realise didn’t care for me. If we weren’t talking I was constantly just hoping he would come back. This is another thing I tend to do. 

Before he got a girlfriend he followed me on Instagram again (actually I requested him then unrequested him...but he must of saw the request). Then in December I found out about his new relationship from a mutual friend who announced that he “passed his life on with the boys”. I was shocked...I thought “he wasn’t ready for a relationship”. He got into the relationship with this girl 3 weeks after dating her...the same amount of time we dated before he told me he wasn’t ready. 

He also blocked me on everything. I requested his girlfriend (which I shouldn’t have) and he messaged me and told me “in the nicest way possible, please stop requesting my girlfriend”. 

I felt hurt...I was stalking them on Instagram and Facebook (which I don’t do anymore thanks to therapy) and seeing her become really close with all his family and friends (his sister was complimenting her ig pics like they’ve been friends forever) and going on these amazing dates with him, seeing him make it Facebook/Instagram official and changed his profile picture of him looking and smiling at her. This is exactly what I wanted and he knew that. 

I had a massive mental breakdown a few months ago and ended up calling him and telling him that he hurt me. He “apologised” and referred to me as the “girl from tinder”. He also lied that he told me “straight up he didn’t want to see me again” when that wasn’t the case. I felt like a massive loser at this point. I realised I played myself. I kept leading something on that wasn’t actually there. I was confused. Was it my fault, was it his fault? Why couldn’t I see that he was just hurting me and that we weren’t a match? 

Overall, I because ultra obsessed with him, thinking he was “too perfect” for me and I was “never going to be good enough”. Even though at first he was the one that thought I was “too good” for him. Also for some reason his 20th bday and graduation for his tradesman apprenticeship is coming up and it hurts me to think that he’s spending that with someone else. 

Now I have a hard time trusting guys over this stupid thing (along with the other “things”). I feel like I’m going to be alone forever and it hurts seeing all my friends get into relationships while I just keep getting rejected for someone else. 

What’s your opinion on this situation. How can I stop “playing myself” as I often do this without realising but yet also have the ability to trust others.

130,"This will be kinda long. So when I was 16 I developed a crush on a boy who I caught staring at me in class. I had never had a boy stare at me like that before and it was really sweet. Our relationship consisted of staring and doing little things to get the others attention because he was painfully shy and socially awkward. It caused him physical discomfort being near me let alone talk to me but he did the typical shy guy behavior. Staring, trying to indirectly make me laugh, pouting when I didn't look at him and getting jealous if I talked to any other guy single or not. Also during this time I was going through a severe depression I was suicidal. He literally lifted my heart when I saw him or heard his laugh ect... all of my sadness and pain would disappear for just a second. I loved him so much he prevented me from attempting suicide without ever saying a word to me. Nothing ever happened just a lot of frustrating back and forth. Graduating was what ended our relationship. I tried reaching out several times that didn't work he reacted like he would when we were physically together. I gave up telling myself I deserved better and he couldn't like me that much if he can't talk to me. That this is the depression and need for attention that keeps me tethered to him. It's been four years though... my depression is managed, the best friends I wanted and have gotten male attention else where but never resulted in dating. I still think about him though I could even go weeks without thinking about him but randomly he'll show up in my dreams too much for my liking. I thought if I confessed to him over social media I would be okay once it was out completely... I didn't let him reply either way though I blocked him and privated my account because I didn't want to know the confession was for me... I don't know what to do or how to move past this he's in my dreams still and I miss him sometimes. I don't know if this means anything or this is just normal stuff. Any advice or input would be apprciated.

131,"I have struggled with an eating disorder for 10 years, starting when I was 25. It’s only in the last 2 years that I really have openly admitted I have a problem, because the changes in my body prompted other people to make comments about me. Sometimes these were good: “you look awesome! What’s your secret?” Sometimes these were bad: “you need to eat a cheeseburger. You’re getting TOO skinny.” I don’t think anyone ever MEANT to hurt my feelings, and I’m not saying this to complain; I’m just providing context about why I started openly discussing my ED.

I have found that I get support everywhere I turn. Many people don’t understand that anorexia is a lot like heroin addiction: you don’t start off thinking you’re going to be huddled in the fetal position, hiding in your bedroom closet, crying uncontrollably because you “failed” at dieting. You don’t start off realizing that it will poison all of your relationships, and how it absolutely will hurt those you love, as they helplessly watch you try and starve yourself to death (or openly lie to them about whether you’ve eaten). My road to recovery began the minute I started sharing my struggle, honestly, with anyone who asked. It’s been through a lot of ups and downs since then. 

One of the things I have decided to try and do to be more healthy overall is to try and strength train. A huge goal of mine when I started was to be able to do JUST ONE unassisted pull up or chin up.

I trained FOR MONTHS at a time starting a couple of years ago, but I never got to where I could do a chin-up... at least, I thought. I have also stopped and started working out because these past two years, I’ve also been doing a lot of self-reflection, and my recovery process has often been three steps forward and two and a half steps back. I have relapsed multiple times, some WAY worse than before. But I’m determined to have “rock bottom” behind me.

I live in part of the US where the lockdown has been pretty significant. I have a secure job and steady income, thank goodness; but I’m seeing many friends and family struggle. I’ve felt very, very isolated, especially because I haven’t seen any of my family members and most of my friends for months now, with no end in sight. So, it’s hard. I’m luckier than most, but it’s hard to keep from managing my stress with the terrible coping mechanism of not eating. I have failed, often, but usually for just a day or so.

I’ve tried to stay somewhat active so that my body doesn’t atrophy terribly, and so that I can try and keep my mood elevated. It’s been hard, especially because I have the chicken/egg problem of insomnia as well, but one way that has worked has been to do as much physical activity around the house as possible. I’m trying to spend as much time as I can just... not sitting. I think it helps, at least a little. 

So today I was doing laundry. My boyfriend had just finished using our doorframe pull-up bar, which I use to hang clothes while they dry (we don’t have a backyard). I was transferring the wet clothes to the pull up bar, when i joked about (and then hilariously failed at) doing a one-armed pull up. 

Then I had the sudden urge to ask, “so what’s the easiest kind of pull-up, anyways?” My boyfriend told me, “a chin up: palms facing you, shoulder width apart.” I tried it, and other than kind of giving myself a “jump” at the beginning to start my elbows at about a 150° angle instead of fully straight, I did it. I yelled at my boyfriend to come and see; he believed me, but I didn’t.

Then I did it again, and I realized: the whole time I was training a while back, I was much stronger than I am now. That means I could have done this all along. And that I’m probably much stronger than I give myself credit for; all I have to do is just give myself a little “jump” to get going sometimes.",10May2020,1
