2,"I’m a young guy and  went to my job  adviser of one month she had chose me forward for a job interview.  and she asked me do I need interview clothes ( polite/bubbly  tone of voice) i said ‘no thanks iv got all that’ and her response was ""oh, have you got all that? (Bubbly Tone of voice as I said) and then she said ‘ ok well do you know how to conduct yourself on an interview"" while looking at me pleasantly with furrows eyebrows  , (see I’m very shy and  quiet) I said ‘yes’ she went on to say (she used her hands as gestures in motion to what she was saying)  ""ok, well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes....make sure you get a shave. make sure you cut your nails. make sure you do you're hair up all nice and that"" (in a voice between a mix of bubbly and assertive) then she paused a bit looking at her computer and then said ""and make sure you put some aftershave on as well, for the girls make sure it's men's"" then she burst out laughing. I just smiled with it. She said it nicely judging by a laugh at the end but idk. i wasn't near clean shaven at the time of the appointment tbh) but always was previous appointments. she sent me an email the next day about it saying about what I need to take with me to the interview and at the bottom it had underlined ‘please dress smartly’ and ‘good luck’ 

Edit- the next interview she chose me for I had the next week she never said anything like this at all again and she filled out the application form for me for it and I didn’t ask",17Jun2020,1

I built this particular one on The Ricky Gervais Show featuring Steve Merchant and Karl Pilkington - all the transcripts I could find ;)

I built this one to flirt with you regardless of the time of day, or such stresses common folk have like headaches or being toooo tired...

9,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody/mad about it so idk what to as then it was probably annoying too. One point I nodded in agreement at something she said in a moody way and she said ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ in an annoyed way. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it too",17Jun2020,1

16,"This is about the girl next door, literally. 

She's been in my life since the 5th grade. I first noticed her in fourth grade but didn't think anything of it, then 5th grade it turns out she's my neighbor. So this is about 2003-05ish, elementary school. We did not like each other from 5th to 6th grade, she was way more vocal about it. Then 7th grade came around and I was getting to like her, get along I mean, mostly because she was becoming nicer to me. 6th to 8th grade I was picked on a lot so having her as a ""friend"" helped me put a hold on my problems.

Then 8th grade came up and I've got a crush on her. At the time my parents never let me go out on my own or hang out with friends or allow me to invite people over so I just kept my feelings to myself because I knew I couldn't really do anything about it. 

8th grade is over and so is middle school so that means everyone is picking their choice of high schools and away we go.

I got over my crush on the girl next door because what was the point? We were already pretty different and come on, this is me we're talking about. Nobody wants to be in a relationship with me.

I went a full year without seeing the girl next door and honestly, she was shelved in the back of my mind. I did however run into her in sophmore year (we both had to take the same city bus) we said hi and that was that.

Then junior year I kept seeing her over an over.  And we talked, more and more. And I have a crush on her all over again. The stupidest thing I did for junior and senior year was work out what time to leave my house just to catch the same time bus as her.

Did I tell her how I felt? Nope, why would I do that? Let's be real, she's a bright light and I'm some dull color in the background.

High School is over and it's time to work on our careers. I don't see the girl next door for about 5 years.

We've run into each other a couple of times and if I talk to her for more than 5 mins i'll have a pointless crush on her all over again. 

Then there's a pandemic and I lose my father to it. It was kind of sudden I guess and the hospital he passed away at happened to have a lot of the same people we go to church with so I guess he wasn't actually alone. The funeral was the next week after he passed and myself and the rest of the family is coping and slowly moving on. 

So what's this have to do with the girl next door?

I saw her a couple of times in passing and normally I'd be more than willing to go and talk to her. I just don't want to now. 

I have this thought that if i talk to her I might break down. I didn't cry when I got the phone call when my father passed and I didn't cry when I saw his body in the casket. I just have this feeling she's the one that  would bring it out.

My dad always seemed to like her and so does my mom and she doesn't like anybody.

I feel like I need her number and I don't know why. I've seen her walking around the neighborhood when I'm getting home from work and I just wait for her to leave so I don't have to talk to her.

She's been on and off in my mind for pretty much forever. A part of me wants to just talk to her but another part of me doesn't want to just use her as some kind of emotional support.

All i want is her phone number and then...i don't know.",17Jun2020,1

25,"We were in a relationship for 3 years before parting ways at the end of high school. Although our relationship had good moments, it was very much a toxic relationship. However, we refused to break up because of how comfortable we were with each other, and also because we actually ""loved"" each other, though now it seems that that word held so little value. 

In hindsight, I realize I was the more toxic half of our relationship. I gaslighted a lot, I hurt my partner with words in ways I never thought I would ever do. Looking back at those memories, I would always see myself as a monster. 

After every altercation, one of us would always apologize to the other and we would be happy again until the next altercation comes. This seemed to be a pattern in our relationship. It was literally a rollercoaster of highs and lows. The reasons we fought varied, but, since we were pretty immature, it would usually about how I did not give my partner enough of my time or some other small thing like that. 

I think the fact that we fought a lot is partly due to the way our school community valued excellence. We weren't really the best students in our batch, so we would constantly be pushed to exert more effort just so we could keep up with others. Combine that with the dates we forced to squeeze in here and there, it was doubly exhausting and stressful.

Anyways, the fights continued for two years until something happened. I started chatting with one of my classmates and hid it from my partner. Long story short, it eventually escalated into cheating (it did not go beyond the chatting, but you could still be super flirty in chat). However, this did not end our relationship, it simply became the lowest of lows in our rollercoaster together. I seriously reflected on my actions and questioned my values then. I actually wanted to break up because I knew my partner deserved more than me. In fact, I felt like I did not deserve to be in a relationship anymore. But my partner did not feel the same. My partner believed I could change, and was willing to rebuild our relationship. I honestly had mixed emotions about that. I was happy that my partner loved me that much which made me want to stay in the relationship as well, but at the same time I wanted to push my partner away because I still felt undeserving of love and I was also afraid I could never equally reciprocate the love that that person gives me. 

I would constantly express to my partner how they would be happier with someone better than me. To be honest, if my partner got in a relationship with someone else then and there, and I would see them smile, I would happy. but that did not happen. Instead, the roller coaster continued until final low, even lower than the lowest of low was reached. I cheated. Again. With the same person. And this time it was proper cheating. We went on dates, and even kissed a little. I honestly felt so guilty afterwards. I could never understand why I had the nerve to hurt my partner, who loved me so unconditionally, for a second time. I told my partner myself about those crimes I committed. It devastated them. But we still didn't break up. At least technically not. We still talked to each other and we still hung out a lot, but at this point it doesn't feel right to call them my partner even though we remained intimate. The rollercoaster went on, but those lowest parts became taboo that were never to be mentioned. Sometimes, my partner would just cry when we were together when she remembers those low points in our relationship. I honestly feel like I gave them trauma or something.

The rollercoaster went on and on, this time more gently, until quarantine came and we had no way to hang out anymore. We remained in contact with each other through chat, but we slowly took longer and longer to reply until we stopped chatting altogether. In these conversations, I found out that they grew feelings for a friend of mine, so they were probably chatting frequently. I honestly want to talk to them, but it seems like we ran out of things to talk. 

Just yesterday, I reached out to them. They told me I had good friends, especially the person they have feelings for because, apparently, my friend said that ""they did not want to be in a relationship because they value the friendship that we have together"" or something like that. 

I was happy that my friend felt that way for me, but I did not want to be a hindrance to their possible happiness together so I expressed that to my ex-partner. Yet deep inside it feels so painful and lonely that my ex has someone else while I havent fully moved on. I cant stop thinking about my ex. I cant stop hating myself for not changing for the better. To me, the rollercoaster just dove down and Im praying that it will come back up. But Im sure the rollercoaster for my ex has already stopped. 

Since then, I've been in a rollercoaster of emotions. I want it all to end. I want to go back and undo all my mistakes. I want to disappear. I want to show I can really change. I want to cry forever. I want to see them happy together. I want my ex to be happy together with me. There are times when I am able to escape this crazy train of thought and think rationally for a second. I would think of how college could be a fresh start for me and how I can really grow as person then. I've recently deactivated all my social media in the hopes of forcing my mind something else to think about. I still can't believe how much of a shit person I was, and, probably, am, but I feel motivated to become a person I can love—I dont want to be the villain anymore. The end.

32,"Sorry for writing so much I want to get this off my chest. 

First some context: yesterday 3 old friends of mine from high school made plans to go to the beach soon. I haven’t seen them in a long time and really want to go but I haven’t been to the beach since I was about 7 years old. I am now 20. Ever since middle school I have been extremely self conscious of myself and my body/weight. I’ve always been a little bit heavier than the other girls in my grade. 

My mom used to feed me a lot when I was little because when she was young, she grew up really poor and could barely afford to eat once a day. I think she feared that I would be malnourished. Well I was a chubby little baby and never lost the “baby fat” that my mom said will eventually disappear. It doesn’t help that in China that their ideal beauty standards consist of being stick skinny and having porcelain white skin. Every summer when I go back go China with my parents to visit our relatives I stood out like a sore thumb (all chubby and tan because I liked playing in the sun) and all my aunts would point out my stomach rolls or big arms and thighs and also “american butt” (basically meaning its big I guess ?). 

I’ve tried working out at the gym ever since I started college but never followed through with it mostly because I was too self conscious to even go to the gym and see all the buff football players and girls that are toned and fit. I honestly hate myself for feeling this way because I know I’m overthinking things. My college friends always say I’m fine and just “thick” but I don’t see it like that at all. I haven’t worn a dress in years, if I wear anything short sleeved it must cover at least half if not all of my upper arms, and I only recently began wearing shorts out in public. All my life I hated having pictures taken of me because I didn’t want to see myself and the double chin, or round body. I’m sick of feeling this way about myself and I genuinely want to be fine with the way I am built. I want to wear anything I want in public without caring what others think. I want to be able to take pictures with my friends and not hate all of them. I want to be happy and comfortable, and put myself out into the dating scene finally. But I can’t. I just can’t, and I’m scared I’ll never be able to love myself and be like this for the rest of my life. I’ve missed out on so many opportunities because of this fear and I don’t want to continue it. I really want to be more comfortable with my weight which I know isn’t even too bad but its so hard to look at myself in the mirror and not feel ashamed and defeated because I don’t have thin arms or narrow shoulders or a noticeable waist or long legs. 

I don’t know. Maybe I’ll try working out again sometime soon. Maybe I won’t give up this time. Sorry for the lengthy post and probably making 100000 grammatical errors throughout.",17Jun2020,1

I (18F) see a therapist weekly, a psychiatrist every other week, and am on SSRIs (antidepressants to aid in serotonin receptors) to treat both anxiety and depression (20mg of Escitalopram; been on antidepressants for 7 months). I have a great, high paying job for someone my age. I’m financially independent and stable. I excel in university. Even though I’m getting treatment for my mental health issues and even though, on paper, I have a good life, I feel like I’ll never overcome my depression and anxiety. 

For a while, I thought my depression was subsiding as it had in the past. I’ve spent the last 4-5 months not feeling depressed regularly which is a long time for me. But it comes and goes in waves and I’m afraid that it’s coming back around now. 

I’ve felt this way for as long as I can remember. Even when I was much younger. What if I’ll feel this way forever? What if some of us just aren’t meant to be free of depression? What if I don’t want to keep on going like this?

2. I’ve been working out more and working on my overall fitness now. I felt I had no reason to in high school after I quit basketball junior year so I stopped but I’ve gotten back into it and have been pushing myself.

3. I feel like I have good hygiene. I take care of myself everyday trying to maintain my best personal hygiene.

4. I think I’m thoughtful. I really value other people’s thoughts, feelings and opinions. I truly care about people even if they are just strangers, but especially the people closest to me. I’m a good, attentive ear when someone is talking to me or needs to get something off their chest.

5. I like experimenting and trying new things. With how I grew up I didn’t always get to have the same experiences as other people. I’m always down to try something new no matter what it is most of the time. I like to have fun or at least try to. I want to be someone who people want to hang out with again. I just don’t get many opportunities due to some of my weaknesses I’ll share.

Weaknesses:

1. No self confidence or self esteem. I’ve been fighting some bad thoughts in my head at times. I hate being so lonely and isolated all the time. I’ve struggled finding a purpose for a while but I’ve started to take up some hobbies and now I’ve been starting to care a bit more for myself. I’m working now and plan on going to college in the fall which is cool.

2. It kind of goes with the 1st one but I can be kind of shy or stand offish I guess you could say. This doesn’t bode well at all for me and I know it but I can’t help it. I WANT to be other people’s friend but I get too nervous. I just assume they would rather not be bothered by my presence. It also kind of ties into my self confidence as well because I just don’t believe in myself and that I’d be able to just go up and make a potential friend. I do better when someone approaches me because then I know it was on their terms. Like I said though I know I probably don’t always look the most approachable because I probably look odd and nervous.

3. I take a while to open up to others. I don’t share too much personal stuff right away. I’m able to hold a conversation but I probably don’t make a real connection most of the time or leave them thinking about me later. I struggle to just let myself be a little vulnerable with people. It’s like a defense thing for me because I’ve been burned by stuff like that in the past. I’m someone who will talk your ear off and try to have fun and a good time if I’m comfortable enough around you if it makes sense. It’s just getting to that point. It’s almost like another layer of ice that needs to be broken. This probably leads to people having different perceptions of me. Most kids in my school probably thought I was a weird quiet kid but if you asked the 4-6 people I was pretty close with they’d say something completely different. My mom would always be confused about what my teachers would say at conferences. They’d tell her I was quiet, a hard worker, and really introverted. She thought they were crazy lol.

4. I’m not very handy when it comes to certain things. I’ve never had my dad in my life. I didn’t always get the same “manly” experiences as other kids. The closest thing I had was my step dad until I was almost 14 but then they divorced and I haven’t had a consistent father figure since so I just don’t know how to do a lot of handyman things. I like to think I’m a problem solver though and can take my time to work through problems. This kind of ties into why I like to try new things and learn especially from my friends who have more of these skills. I’ve built things with my friends, I learned to fish and got my firearm safety license thing, just to name a few things.

5. The root of my problems such as my self confidence, self esteem, introversion, shyness. My appearance. I’ve just had to deal with it. I’m ugly. I’ve been told I’m ugly. I’m tall and pretty thin. I have red hair. My nose is a bit weird. I have a lazy eye so I wear glasses. My voice is pretty soft/quiet. I never speak with much confidence in anything. This also affects my confidence. I have been working to add some muscle.

I just want to say thank you so much in advance for ANYONE who took the time to read my whole post. I also really appreciate and thank anyone who gives me any advice, help or tips!",17Jun2020,1

I decided that drinking may be a good distraction so I tried that and for a while it was good but I don’t stay drunk for long.  Now my boyfriend keeps trying to initiate like sexual stuff and I just really don’t want anything sexual.  While I was drunk he kinda fingered me even though I didn’t want that either.  He keeps saying things like yes you do and oh shut up you do like it and I really wish I did but I don’t.  Like I’m so fucking sorry that I don’t i want to &amp; I feel so bad for trying to tell him no every time.  I’m literally crying while he’s trying to stick his dick in my ass right now.  What the fuck is wrong with me.  Its not that I don’t enjoy it, i guess it’s mostly because I fucking disgust myself and I have personal issues with feeling embarrassed during and after.  I cant even make him cum, he has to do it himself.  He just wants to have a good time and I always always always ruin it.  I’m ruining it right now and I can’t even make myself stop.

43,"This is a person I absolutely adore, and I check her account almost every day, just to see what tweets she's liked and stuff. However, tonight when I went to view her account, a blank page came up saying, ""This account doesn't exist."" It's like all those years she spent tweeting, replying to people, posting photos is GONE!!! I have no fucking clue what happened, no idea why she would delete her account, seeing as she's on there quite frequently and seems to enjoy staying in touch with people. Ugh, I know it probably sounds stupid to you, but I swear I'm not going to be able to sleep tonight wondering if this is a sign she's decided to leave social media. Thank GOD her Instagram is still up and running (as that's the platform I interact with her the most on), but part of me is worried she might delete that without explanation too.

I'm just so worried about her. I'm worried something might have happened to her account, like maybe she was hacked, and she had to delete it. How sad to lose everything! But I'm also worried about the other possibility, that she deleted it because she's decided to abandon her fans. I'm definitely trying to calm myself down and not jump to conclusions here, as I realize there could be a ton of explanations for this, like maybe she's just decided to make a new account for some reason, but my mind can't stop envisioning the worst case scenarios. If she disappears from social media I will honestly be devastated, because it's the only way I've been able to contact her! I would almost consider her like a social media friend at this point, and it would break my heart if I didn't have a way to talk to her anymore.",17Jun2020,1

49,"I'm just trying to hold out hope that things can get better, that I can find a way to have a normal life, but more and more it just feels completely unattainable to me. Just like the last post I made, this post is going to be very long, but I **really** need someone to read it. Please take some time, and if you have any advice or support to give, please chime in. I'll take whatever I can get.

I'm 24M, and as I've mentioned before I'm on the autism spectrum, although I have it pretty mildly. I'm definitely very socially inclined and extroverted, and I have put a lot of effort into building and improving on my social skills.

Despite this, I still am incredibly lonely and have tried just about every opportunity available to me to meet new people with no results (I have a list of posts about this below). I do know what I like and what I'm looking for when trying to make new friends, but when I am able to find people who meet these criteria, they never seem to want me around. I've tried branching out and trying to bond with people in situations that aren't necessarily where I'd normally look, but still haven't been able to make any real friendships. The few friends who I do have (mostly from childhood) are only in touch with me rarely, and are drifting even farther away all the time.

I've asked for advice over and over, and the more that the typical solutions offered to most people don't work, I'm increasingly getting the feeling that I just need to learn to accept living life mostly on my own, and other people have advised the same - basically, if I can't have a good social life then I should just focus on other parts of life. But the thing is, the other parts of my life are total shit as well.

In addition to being on the autism spectrum, I have a severe and treatment-resistant anxiety disorder. I've been to 11 different therapists since I was 6 years old, been on more types and combinations of medication than I can count, and had plenty of things removed from my diet. Nothing has made much difference. I get overwhelmed very easily and when I do I just completely shut down to the point where it takes me hours, sometimes days, to recover. Once I hit a certain stress level I just cannot take any more no matter how important something is, how tight the deadlines are, whatever. I've been this way for as long as I can remember.

I've been through three college programs now (halfway done my last semester) and I have struggled and scraped and ground my way through them for the past five years. I've put myself through extreme stress, more shutdowns and anxiety attacks than I can count, fought against odds that felt completely hopeless, and at my latest program, basically had to flat out beat my school into giving me supports and accommodations for my disabilities. Throughout all of this I have felt like my capacity to keep doing it is diminishing. It's getting harder for me to learn things, I need breaks from class more frequently, I'm struggling more and more with memorizing the information, and I honestly feel like I'm hitting my lifetime capacity for education and just can't take any more.

It's even affecting other areas of my life. I have to put so much time, energy, effort, stress, and *suffering* into school that I have absolutely nothing left in me at the end of the day. I haven't had time for any of the things I like to do, I haven't had the energy to keep up my normal workout routine (I've gained 18 pounds since September), I haven't had the time or the energy to go out or do anything.

And after all that, when I finally feel like the end might be in sight? I learned today that additional training programs are required for pretty much all of the jobs that I'm interested in, so my current program which has caused me by far the most stress out of the three that I've been through will probably not even get me a fucking job. And I don't know if I'll be able to handle any more after this.

Speaking of work, I've only ever had two jobs. The first one wasn't much more than a co-op program, and it was five years ago, just after I graduated high school. I worked at a fast food place that specifically provided work for disabilities and only had 5 hours of work a week because of the number of people they had to employ. Even still, it was a very fast-paced and stressful environment and it took a lot out of me.

My second job was last summer, working in PR at another company that specifically employed people with disabilities. It was more work, about 20 hours a week, but the stress and tight deadlines took so much out of me that I feel like this was just about my capacity for work. I really don't think I can handle working more than 20 hours a week because this job absolutely pushed me to the very last ounce of energy that I had. I would come home from work, eat dinner, and then probably sleep for 10-11 hours every night. There was so much stuff to keep track of, the deadlines were so strict...I was on the extreme edge of being able to handle it at all.

I almost certainly won't be able to handle full-time work. It seems like 20 hours a week is pretty close to my limit. I might be able to push it to 25, but beyond that I think it would just be too much stress for me to be able to handle. The problem is the vast majority of workplaces would not be willing to accommodate disabilities like the ones I have. Yes, there are some places in the field where I want to work that have rotating shifts, but they tend to pay minimum wage or just barely above minimum wage. In either case, they don't tend to pay living wage. I am on disability benefits, but they don't pay anywhere near living wage either, and even with a part-time, minimum wage job it would be extremely iffy and I'd always be at considerable risk of not being able to pay for even the most affordable housing. There is supported living housing in my area for people with disabilities, but I don't qualify for it because I'm ""not disabled enough"".

In a nutshell, my chances of moving out of my parent's house at any point in the foreseeable future is effectively zero, and there's a definite possibility that I might never be able to at all. My parents are actually working towards buying a condo and leaving it in my name so that I would have somewhere to stay when they die.

I ***really*** don't want to be, but thanks to my anxiety, disabilities, and the fact that all of the jobs that I'm even remotely interested in are very low-paying, I will probably always be living with my parents as a useless basement dweller.

This brings me back to the social side of things. Not being able to handle full-time work and staying in these low-income situations will raise red flags. If, by some miracle, I manage to get hired in a place that I would like to work that is willing to accommodate my disabilities, it will still seem extremely odd that I work part-time when everyone else is working full-time. My disability will make me come across as lazy to other people, and even if I land a job at a workplace with rotating shifts, the stress and anxiety that I will inevitably have to deal with will definitely make me seem weird, creepy, immature, or childish to my coworkers. As I've said in previous posts, there aren't really any volunteer opportunities or hobby groups in my area, I've tried online sites like Meetup with no luck, I've tried just going to places that I enjoy going to, continuously work on my social skills, and I still haven't been able to meet anyone.

My dating life is nonexistent, and admittedly eventually meeting someone to fall in love with and have a good relationship with is pretty important to me. I've been on a grand total of one date in my life so far, and even that was just me being catfished. I've had no luck with dating apps, and since my social life is extremely limited, there's no chance that I'll meet anyone through any of my friends.

Recently, however, I've also come to realize that I'm probably not mature or developmentally stable enough to be cut out for dating or relationships, either. The extent of my limitations with my ability to work, the panic attacks and shutdowns that I go through, and the fact that I am stuck living with my parents, would all raise major red flags, and rightfully so. Since I'm not capable of supporting myself or being independent, dating is probably something I should just give up on.

I am not a functional adult, and so I should not date. It's as simple as that. Besides, my anxiety disorder would most likely make me very clingy, and I don't want to inflict that on anyone.

To be honest, part of (**not the only reason by any means, but one reason**) why trying to get a girlfriend has been so important to me up until recently is because I haven't received or been able to give any emotional or physical affection to anyone for so long. My family is pretty cold. My parents used to be super open towards me. When I was a kid, my we would hug each other all the time, always tell each other that we loved each other, and so on. Then, when I was in high school, they just...kind of drifted away from all of that. When I was a teenager I would try to hug my parents (and other members of the family) and they would say things like ""aren't you getting a little old for that?"" or ""hugging is for little kids"". Nowadays if either of my parents shows any affection at all, it's an occasion.

I know how stupid and pathetic it is, but I'm really starved for affection from other people. I know I sound like a little girl at this point. It's stupid, it's sad, it's pitiful and pathetic, I know, I know, I know. I just needed to get that off my chest as well.

So, to sum up, here are my life prospects right now:

**Social life** \- Very few friends, rarely see or talk to them, can't make new friends no matter what I try.

**Dating life** \- Nonexistent. I am not capable of dating, relationships etc. because I have very little chance of moving out of my parent's house or financially supporting myself, and my anxiety disorder would probably make me very clingy in a relationship, and I don't want to inflict myself on anyone else.

**Family life -** While my parents are not abusive or anything, they are not very open emotionally. We never do anything fun as a family, we don't hug each other or show much affection towards each other, and my parents can honestly be pretty cold to me a lot of the time. I'm honestly pretty starved for affection from other people at this point.

**Work prospects** \- Extremely limited because my severe anxiety disorder and autism spectrum disorder mean that I can barely handle part-time work.

**Housing/Independence -** Effectively impossible, since I have next to no chance of being able to afford any sort of housing and don't qualify for supported living, so will most likely always live with my parents/other relatives after my parents die.

TL;DR: **Every single aspect of my life is awful.** I have fought with every last bit of strength that I have to improve my situation and tried just about every possible solution that either I or others could think of, and nothing has worked. I feel like I have nothing to live for and nothing will ever get better. **I am NOT suicidal,** but right now I'm pretty much completely out of hope and just close to accepting that my life will always be terrible.",17Jun2020,1

A lot of stuff happened, some things that could have been avoided, some don't.





What I honestly miss the most is that I haven't experienced relationships yet and I think I should focus more on socializing and learning new things.

ya que era de noche y estaba en el sofa viendo peliculas solo cargaba puesto un pantalon simple y un sueter simple sin calzado alguno.

luego del suseso me dijo que me fuera de su casa( en la ciudad) hasta la casa de mi madre que se encontraba a 25km de distancia yo no sabia que hacer asi que trate de entrar al apartamento pero me seguia golpeando cuando lo intentaba trate por lo menos de tomar mi calzado pero ni eso me dejo recuerdo haber caminado unos 8 km aproximandamente por la noche pidiendo dinero de aquellos que vi por la calle, ya que solo habia podido recaudar 85 centavos y el pasaje costaba 50 para ir a la terminal y 75 para irme a casa decidi caminar hasta la terminaly pedir el bus.

al llegar a casa con los pies adoloridos jure jamas volver a verlo igual yo no le importaba a el, el seguia llegando a la casa como si nada de vez en cuando para ver a su preciosa hija pero a mi no me diriguia la palabra incluso llego a meterse a mi cuarto a empujarme e incitarme a pelear.

luego de su muerte mi vida no hizo mas que empeorar ya que solo llego gente a casa pidiendo dinero y la gente en la cual confiamos nos traiciono solo por miseros dolares ya tontamente me gaste el dinero de mi herencia que no era mucho ya que solo nos dieron alrededor de 17mil dolares lo demas se lo robaron mi abuela paterna y esas personas. mi madre nunca quiso verificarlo con la ley a pesar que se lo dije, ella seguia creyendo en las palabras y consejos de otros debido a que me e puesto a aprender en mis trabajos e logrado conocimiento de computacion e ingles y algo de programacion pero cada vez que gano dinero mi madre me grita y me hace un drama para que me lo gaste en lo que ella quiere ya que no le alcanza el dinero( ovio se lo gasta en diesmos, ofrendas, ayudando hermanas, comprando mercancia de avon, herbalife o incluso negocios PIRAMIDALES) sin retorno de ganancia cuando no le quieren comprar me pide que se lo compre a ella para que ella lo use o como muchas veces se queda en una esquina tomando polvo. me reclama por cualquier cencillo que yo le pida prestado pero ella me sigue pidiendo plata para la gasolina, pagar deudas de su carro, deudas que le tiene con sus compañeros de trabajo o de la casa y vaya que pide dinero pero cuando le pido que me lo devuelva siempre me dice que no recientemente me dice que vaya a la corregiduria a poner un reclamo si en caso esta abierto JAJAJAJA en cuarentena y sin ningun dato escrito en pagares o contratos nada escrito en papel que chiste.

estoy comprando la comida 1 vez al mes un super completo mientras que ella compra lo faltante y cuando me ve tomando me grita que me ire al infierno, que soy una decepcion y en otras me dice que porque tengo dinero para alcohol y cigarrillos y no tengo para ayudarla (CON SUS PUTAS CUENTAS) que debe noc a quien 

ella sin conocer a las amistades que hago lo primero que hace es llorar y esperar que yo llege para gritarle al primero que vea que se large que es una mala influencia y que no lo quiere ver en mi casa ( amistades del trabajo o nuevas amistades las cuales no llevo mucho de conocer). e tratado de irme de la casa 2 veces pero ella siempre me llama o escribe que esta mal o que algo paso una vez se tiro en un centro comercial y mi hermana se fue solo quede yo pasando pena solo para que me dijera que era para ver que haciamos REALLY cada vez que le cuento mi sueños sobre ser millonario o incluso viajar por el mundo ella se molesta y me dice en pocas palabras ( ahi va de nuevo, porque no te conformas ) aveces me averguenza salir de la caza por la pena y solo me entran ganaz de fumar y eso que solo cuento una pequeña casi minima parte de mi vida.

debido a mis malas acciones perdi mi carro y estoy endeudado hasta la zapatilla con mas de 20 mil en deudas pero no importa que haga no logro salir lo unico que oigo es DIOS ES BUENO jajajajaja por donde si dios es tan bueno porque me trata de esa forma acaso fui hittler en mi vida pasada o algo mas.

aun considero ceriamente el suicidarme

ojala los cuentos o novelas que leo sobre pactos con el diablo, dios o alguna entidad por dinero fueran reales  

asi me alejaria de todo eso cambiar mi numero, pagar mis deudas e irme a vivir al campo en soledad  lejos de esta vida.a pesar de que me gustan las mujeres creo que estoy llegando a odiarlas a todas.

69,"I don’t know why I feel this way. I have a supportive family, great SO, and overall my life is moving in a promising direction. I have people who love me. No major problems, in fact I’ve probably got it better than most. 

So I feel really selfish/ungrateful when I feel tired of existing. I’m not suicidal, or at risk of hurting myself, mostly because I know that would hurt the people I care about. I just wish I hadn’t been born in the first place. There’s so much pain and suffering in the world, I don’t want to be a part of it. I have a lot of empathy, and seeing the stuff that happens, how cruel/ugly we can be to each other, it just rips me apart. Maybe I’m hypersensitive. But why’s everything gotta be so hard? Why’s everything gotta be so complicated? What’s even the point of anything? I just feel trapped. 

My passions/hobbies help, but they only get me so far and the excitement of doing them only lasts so long. When the more mundane parts of life inevitably take over (work, routine, etc) I’m quickly back to feeling like it’s all pointless. At the end of the day, the world is still a difficult, unfair, painful place. Yes, there’s a lot of beauty to it. *but what’s the point?* 

Sorry if this comes across as a mopey pity party. Just need to get it off my chest. My SO gets very concerned when I express these thoughts to him, and I don’t want to bring him down this morning.",17Jun2020,1

72,"Hi ppl of reddit,
Like i said in the title im interested in someone i know for about three days (she's the sister of a friend), i get her number thanks to her brother and we talked a little about each other and yesterday i had the courage to ask her out for a coffee in three days.
Im not confident in general and its like the first time i do this and i would like to know if she might misunderstand my intention (even if i think its a obvious for our age), can a woman say yes even if they're not interested ? Like just for hang out for killing the times (ty corona)",17Jun2020,1
74,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody/mad about it so idk what to as then it was probably annoying too. One point I nodded in agreement at something she said in a moody way and she said ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ in an annoyed way. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it too",17Jun2020,1

I had an anxiety attack this morning, but i was able to calm myself down, and now am happily reading a good book. It just feels good when I can get in control of my mental state.",17Jun2020,2
82," To put it bluntly, I don't see the point anymore. I'll give some background. When I was young (18) wanted to be different and stupidly got a neck and hand tattoo I still live with today. Obviously I have changed since then and grown out of that phase as I had a tendancy to be impulsive and on a whim. I wanted to turn my life around, I went to a top 40 college, got good grades and finished with a degree in accounting and finance to which I was immensely proud of myself for a brief moment in time. I've been to probably 20-25 interviews since I left college and all of them rejected me. The only job I could find was a credit control clerk that paid barely enough to get by on, in fact it was so low that unemployment benefits were only about £200-300 less than what I was earning. I am running out of time and my life is going by quickly. Next month I will be 27, I have seen every one of my peers outpace me and have gone onto rich lucrative careers whilst I sit here contemplating death for the 4th time in a single day. I'm not here for pity I only wanted to kind of vent my frustrations and at least have something left of me after I am gone that showed I tried.",17Jun2020,2
83,"The devastation it has caused our family is staggering.  My father is heartbroken, he is 60 and he loves that little girl with all his heart. He and I often joke that she is his “real” daughter. 



I can’t stop thinking about it. I keep crying off and on. My mind is a constant replay of all the things that should have been different when she was taken. The anger I feel in the pit of my stomach feels like glass. 


We had a tip that led nowhere. She couldn’t remember the license plate. She is microchipped and we are offering rewards for her return and for anyone with info.

And for some time now, those love handles have been getting stretch marks. I've been a bit insecure about it, but haven't really cared until now when it's summer and I'll go swimming. My dad pointed them out today and said that they were pretty big, whilst I thought that they were pretty average.

Is there any way to treat them? They are still reddish/purplish and have been for some time.",17Jun2020,1
87,"I am going into my third year of college, and I am having doubts about my major. I am majoring in Biology and on a genetics and biotechnology track because I have always enjoyed learning about science. I am now taking my first genetics class, and we have had this mini quizzes and I haven't been doing well on them, and the worksheets are really challenging for me. My classes that I took for first and second year were just basic bio and chem classes. I had to have a tutor for both because I struggled in them and usually do really bad on the exams but at the end of the year I usually would get B's or C's in the class. When I would have to study for the exams I would usually push off studying for chem, and study bio because it is something I found more interesting. I have had doubts about my major in the past, but my parents say I should just stick with this because it is a good major to graduate with. I am also working in a genetics lab on campus, I enjoy what I do, but sometimes I feel that I am not smart enough for the kind of work I do. It scares me that I am just wasting my time, and did not think clearly of the major that I chose. I feel that it is too late to change my major, and if I did I would not know what to choose. I have always had to work really hard in all my classes, and I still do bad on the exams even if the topic interests me. It just makes me feel that I am not cut out for this major.",17Jun2020,2
88,"Everyone is accepting of LGBTQ relationships which I understand, that’s amazing! 

But when people see a 60 year old man with a 20 year old woman, they make comments. 

Or people that love inanimate objects? It’s not the norm of course, but why bash someone if they truly want to be in a relationship with a pole? 

Incest relationships. While I agree that they should not procreate because that’s just a bad idea and horrible for the child. If family loves each other that much then why should other people care? It’s their lives and they’re not hurting anyone, so don’t bash them for wanting to marry their sibling or parent. 

There are probably more but these are the ones I’ve been thinking about. If we can accept a guy dating another guy and vice versa, why can’t we accept if a 60 yr old grandpa wants to love their 18 yr old daughter? Or even a pole??",17Jun2020,0
89,"I've been an atheist for over a decade at this point, but it rarely ever comes up in conversations with family and I'm always treated with common decency/respect for the most part. My grandmother has always had mental issues according to my dad and his siblings, but they've been worse over the last year or so thanks to severe dementia as well as a steady diet of painkillers and televangelists. In the last few months she's taken it upon herself to try to save souls, particularly me and my brother. It isn't out of hostility, but out of a legitimate fear on her part. Her most recent attempt was to somehow get a hold of me and my brother's numbers and call to apologise for her actions, and in the same breath try to save our souls yet again. I finally just had to block her number because if it wasn't religious stuff, she'd be calling me at all hours of the day and night to try to take her to made up doctor's appointments or something. I feel bad for those of you out there that have been in similar situations that have had to do the same, but sometimes we have to do it for our own sanity.",17Jun2020,1

93,"I am 17M and I haven't had any girlfriends for the time being. I am not very social as my peers and I get somewhat nervous around girls. I am curious to know if its alright,as a teenager, to not have a relationship with a girl. Is my situation rare among teenagers? Will there be any repercussions in the future (for example, not much dating experience or flirting).For me its ok but I still get that 'peer pressure' feeling.",17Jun2020,1
94,"This year has been unique in that probably not since the World Wars has nearly every person in the world been put into such a difficult situation. Massive wildfires, the continued erosion of democracy worldwide, pandemic, civil unrest and hostility between countries. However there is usually a positive to every negative. And in this case, it's revealed the true colors of the world.

People will look back on these times and observe how everyone responded to the events of this year. Did your government protect you and try it's best to keep the populace safe? Or did it throw the most vulnerable people under the bus to restart the economy?

Your community; we all got to see how our fellows dealt with the pandemic. Some banded together and supported their community and others hoarded and protested safety measures. I can see many celebrities and companies not being remembered fondly for their actions during this event.

The protests against police brutality. You don't have to buy into the politics of the movement to say black lives matter. As people we need to support others who are vulnerable in society. Police brutality can affect any skin color but let's face it; around the world certain people will be judged more harshly than others. Again, referring to those with power and privilege, how did they react to all this? 

I hope the year passes without more zaniness. But if it does, let's just take care of ourselves.",17Jun2020,1

All the while I really needed to poop, from the start of of the upset.

I literally took a shit and I have energy again and I'm ready to work and get through the hardships, and even took back my cancellation and told them I'm joining.

96,"I started my procedure 4 years ago at 16, now I am 2 months away from it being complete. I am happy to have straight teeth now, but...

In the course of my treatment I had 2 have 2 teeth removed and have an implant in the roof of my mouth. Both of these things were preceded by extreme panic attacks (I also battle depression &amp; anxiety) and followed by pain for days. I didn't get any pain meds prescribed in either case, I wonder if this was normal?

In any case, my ortho responded to this only with an ""Oh that wasn't so bad now was it?"" immediately afterwards. I also had extreme pain after every adjustment for months so that I wpuld be getting panic attacks and wanting to throw up or cut myself after every adjustment.

Originally the orthodontist said the treatment would take 2 1/2 years (this was a deciding factor in my deciding to get braces at all), but as time wore on he just kept saying it would be ""just a little longer"".

After 4 years I finally worked up the nerve to say enough is enough, a different ortho is now finishing up my treatment (my original ortho wanted to go on for another 6 months). But honestly if I could go back in time I would tell my 16 year old self that all the pain and panic attacks and outright trauma were absolutely. Not. F-ing. Worth it.

Thanks for listening to my rant. I guess I could use some guidance...",17Jun2020,1

i've been preparing for my exams and i had to put aside some things i enjoy doing (like, there was no time for gym, parties, art etc.). i was telling myself ""when the exams will be over i'm gonna do this and this and this"". today i had my last exam, i finished high school and now... i just don't know what to do. it's not that i don't have next goal to achieve, because i want to go to a college, but like... idk guys, i can't switch back to chilling and doing nothing. idk probably i'm just damaged lol

99,"This is a story I sometimes had heard growing up, and today I started to tell my boss it. halfway through the story, I was like did this really happen? it sounds too crazy to be true. so I texted my dad for more info and this is what he said.

""It was late, she was in the back seat. It was cold, two lane highway. She was sitting next to the door. Sort of hanging on the door handle. I was about eight sitting in the middle. Almost instantly, the door flew open flinging her out into the darkness. I yelled in surprise, and pandemonium ensued. The car stopped very quickly, we all got out and looked down the road. She was nowhere to be seen. My mother ran in front of the car waving her arms frantically, afraid she might be run over by on coming traffic. I ran back looking for, the ditch on the side she fell out was maybe six to eight feet deep. Filled with long dry weed stocks. Finally there she was, not moving or even crying. When we got her back in the car much of her hair had been torn off. She started to cry and we took her to the doctors. Banged up but okay.

and 

I haven’t thought about it for years.

and

Yes, we thought she might be dead.""

Last time I cut was in winter and it's only grown 3 inches. No matter how hard I try it just doesn't want to lay down. It's almost like an afro but more straight. I have a small head and my face looks ugly. I know for a fact that I'd look much better with long, straight, healthy hair. It even hurts my scalp when I touch my hair, so weird. I can't even run my fingers throw my hair. If I use a wide tooth comb, It pulls some of my hairs. I hate basic hairstyles. I thought maybe it would get better when I grow it out but theres no difference. Now I considering cutting it and wearing a hat because I look ugly.",17Jun2020,2

I have always had very, very long hair. Down to my butt. For years. I have never had shorter hair in my adult life.

So, I'm standing in my restroom, looking into the mirror. And upset. I grab the scissors and chop all my hair off. It is at the top of my shoulders. OMG, what have I done to myself. I hate it. It looks awful and is all uneven, too. I don't know what possessed me to do this, I just did it. I'm trying to comfort myself and I keep telling myself it's just hair and will grow back. I guess I just need comfort because I don't recognize the woman looking back at me in the mirror.",17Jun2020,1

No more Obey Me gay shits, no more other Chinese shit mobile games, just some quality contents.",17Jun2020,1
107," I started a YouTube channel just as a tool itself to battle any internal struggles I’ve had during the pandemic. I don’t care about money. I started volunteering during the pandemic and now I started a YouTube channel on mental health advice. A friend tells me it looks fake because it’s just not a “me” thing to do. 


I don’t care about that opinion, in fact I’m happy with my 22 views on my first video thank you very much. But I don’t always feel like I took that advice in the first place as I perhaps struggled with it throughout my life but I have the intensional to change for the better of course.",17Jun2020,1
108,"The only thing I didn't like about it was the cheap plot line. The movie felt like another typical over sensationalized movie created for money. I've tried my best to not judge it based on part 1 and 2 and tried to look at it through a more contemporary lense and what movies are today but, still didn't like it. Everything else, the characters, cinematography, and the comedy was a solid 10/10 but the story line was very disappointing to me. While id love to see a part 4, at the same time I'm kinda hoping it doesn't happen. I think this franchise has ran its course and should be left to age like fine wine.",17Jun2020,1
109,"Yesterday, without even putting much thought into it, I just permanently deleted my Twitter, Snapchat, and Instagram. Facebook still has some use when it comes to Groups, but I'll eventually just use Reddit, YouTube, Quora, etc. for any help with projects that I'm working on.

I honestly just had no reason to use those apps. It's just a constant distraction full of mindless scrolling accompanied with superficial people who I don't even interact with on a regular basis. It's not like I was addicted to it either. For the longest, I knew it was a waste of time and was going to delete them, and finally, I just.....did it.

110,"Does anyone else ever feel like there’s a big hole in their life and something is missing? These feelings come in waves in my life, and when they hit, they can be quite overwhelming. (For some back story, I’m a 27 y.o. married mother of one with a decent job and a loving family.) I don’t know if it’s lack of adventure, friendship or spontaneity, but I feel like I’m standing still while the world is turning so fast. I’ve always questioned how to measure one’s own success and happiness with the feeling that there is always something to prove. But it seems the older I get, the more prominent these thoughts become and I feel like I’m wasting so many moments I won’t get back. I just don’t know how to feel fulfilled while balancing success, a family, and my own personal values and wants that I have in life. I don’t know if I’m seeking advice or rather just the camaraderie in knowing I am not the only one. I often feel like many of the folks in my life aren’t particularly keen on listening to me babble about my unhappiness, so I thank you ahead of time for lending an ear.",17Jun2020,1

I'm working on starting a tech blog where I aim to create content focused on programming / product management / career in tech etc. My current domain name options are:

* mukulraina \[.\] com
* techwithmukul \[.\] com
* mukul \[.\] io

Pros and Cons of each IMO:

* mukulraina \[.\] com
   * My full name is long and not intuitive
   * I have most of the social media handles (e.g. twitter/insta but not FB)
* techwithmukul \[.\] com
   * Gives an idea in the domain name itself what the website is about
   * easier to read than mukulraina \[.\] com
* mukul \[.\] io
   * short and simple
   * .io domain / seo issues

Which one should I go with?

Thanks a ton!

112,"I tried so hard to put on a happy face everywhere, because from what I see, the happiest people are the most popular, has the most friends, and has the most relationships.

It was pretty tiring, I’d force myself to smile when I didn’t want to, I’d force myself to make jokes when I didn’t want to, and I’d force myself to talk when I really didn’t want to. All because I was scared of being alone, of being left behind.

But recently my best friend fucked the girl I loved behind my back constantly, just to get over his ex. It only just made me wonder, “what am I doing all of this for?”

Truth is, I always won’t have that many friends, I’m just not sociable. I’ll almost always be single, turns out I’m Asexual. Why should I try so hard to be something I’m not? Part of me feels like I’m just depressed, but I’m not, I feel better like this. 

I’ll always have at least one friend, maybe one day I’ll fall in love with someone, but I don’t see the point of putting on a fake smile anymore. It’s not that I’m unhappy, I just find it more comfortable to be sarcastic and reserved. 

I don’t care what anyone thinks anymore, because so many people around me in my life proved they don’t care about me. What’s the point in trying to care when everytime I open to someone they betray me? 

I’ll just work on myself, work hard on my dreams to prove myself and the people that treated me like shit wrong.

6 months ago my face got fat and round af  as I gained weight from 11.3 stone to 11.10 stone. Recently I went down to 11.4 again and jogged  and it made a little difference definitely but not as small as I want . It’s difficult to get below 11.4 stone event with fasting tbh. 

See Iv been jogging most nights in my garden and fasting as I said Iv lost around 5lbs give or take and I’d say only face is about 5% slimmer. I want it smaller like it was before last December. Last year in 2019 April it was larger then than it is now and I lost it in a few weeks of fasting no problem at all. This time Iv been at the jogging and fasting for 3 weeks and very little difference. I fast until 9:30pm then eat is that better?

The thing is I now have this feeling of hate and dread about how I’ve let myself go so far. 3 years out of high school and I’ve gained over 70 lbs.

119,"YouTube. Good ol' monopoly YouTube. YouTube that rolled out double pre-roll ads in November 2018. YouTube that, just four years ago, played a single ad every few videos. And today? Let's count the fucking ads:
* An ad at the top of your recommended video feed.
* An ad every FOUR items in the recommended video feed.
* In search results, the first result is an ad.
* In search results, some results will be ads.
* In search results, the For You and Related blocks that appear in your results include advertiser videos.
* After clicking on every video, a fucking POP-UP ad AND 1 or 2 unskippable or mandatory 5-second-delay-to-skip ads.
* Under the video title/description, there's an ad.
* After moving the comments section to a collapsed area before the related videos, the last video at the bottom of the related videos (where everyone goes to look for the comments) is sometimes replaced with an ad.
* Every THREE minutes of playtime, there's at least one ad, but often two ads.
* There are one or two unskippable ads that auto-play at the end of every video.

I'm not paying $20 a month for YouTube Red when I'm going to have to be advertised to by the content creators because YouTube has cut their share of advertising revenue by something like 70% since 2015.

It's bad enough we're all stupid enough to pay $300 a month for Comcast or Verizon and have 2 minutes of advertisements for every 5 minutes of television. Or that we now have $20 digital *rentals*.

This shit is a joke. We need to throw this out already. It's a dated platform, dated approach, fully corporate and unresponsive. It does nothing to limit exposure to radical nonsense from alt-right nutjobs and liberal goombas.

Yes, it's sad I am *this* frustrated about it. But for crying out loud, this POS company has systematically prevented emerging competitors. They've lagged on efficiency, cut the revenue share with the people who actually make them money, and created an ivory tower for them and record labels and movie studios. They're just terrible people running a terrible platform at this point.",17Jun2020,5

Anyway, back to the topic.

I just realized he has a camera in my room. My room was the one place that I felt even a little bit safe from him, and of course he had to ruin it.

We hear all this talk, and read all this stuff, about boundaries in relationships and how we need to protect ourselves from toxic people. Please understand that ""toxic people"" aren't ONLY outside your family and bloodline. Sometimes, they ARE your family and bloodline. 

Sometimes, they overstep the boundary lines you've laid out so you have to build those lines up again a little higher to make them more noticeable. Other times, you have to build them up super tall and add razor wire to keep the toxic people away from the most vulnerable areas of your self.

They're making me into this , a fucking bumm and I don't want to be like them! I want to move far away from my friends and parents and brother and sister.  When I dropped out of school my mom actual withdrew me. She didn't even tell me I needed school or anything would be hard. My dad or brother and sister never said a word.
