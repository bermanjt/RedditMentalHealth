I see you've come to talk to me again 
Because an inflammation silently creeping
Left it's seeds while I was sleeping
And the uric acid crystals that it planted in my joints 
Still remain 
Along with sounds of silence (because farting hurts with hemorrhoids)",21Oct2020,1

2,all right so when I was 16 I got my first job as a software engineer I know it sounds crazy you have to be older to work as a software engineer  but I live in a different country it's call iraq  so when I was 14 years old I heard that one guy wanted me to work with him cuz I have the English language  so I begged my for my father to let me work with this person  and he finally let me for almost 3 years  so that person is of a kind of a person who has anger issues   so I was working with him for almost a week   but when he showed me his true side I just thought about how much he's a piece of shit  he was  because he's half Kurds which means he is half a dumbass cocksucker  and racist asshole cuz I'm half Persian and half Russian  he got me fired a while I was teaching him some courses and he start to have some anger issues for no reason  like he's jumping under his chair   he told me to enough from this and then when I was trying to teach him again he just slam the laptop and then he told me to get up and then I sit down  into a chair  when the other co-workers his attitude change  and he gave him a sign to him to tell me  to get up again  because I sat down on the computer again  then he's trying to tell me that I have extra co-workers and he's trying to lie about it and then he admit that I got fired  so I wrote a full message on Facebook and tell him that he doesn't belong  to be a software engineer  and then he called my father and apologized and my father didn't accept his apology and he doesn't want his shit job with me  anyway when I was teaching him he was spending his time cheating on his wife talking to other girls on WhatsApp and I pretend that I don't speak Arabic I heard about his story in college and  he said when he got out of college he never understood a single word or even paying attention and that's why he's fucking stupid at his job   because he doesn't even speak English he can't even handle things   by himself  because he got some stupid co-workers can't even figure out how to fix a mouse computer when I show up out of nowhere and I did fix it  well I'm thinking about killing this piece of shit  with his family  or maybe one day I will kill him he will never going to succeed in life because he never paid any attention,21Oct2020,1

4,"So uh, new to reddit, obvs. Basically this is anonymous, so I feel I can speak freely and I don’t have anybody around I can do that with. 

So I’m 23m, not social at all, and definitely was proud of myself for scoring a beautiful woman who wanted to marry me at 16, by 18, (we both came from homes we needed to rise above, and we did) at the end of school we had already started our life, on to bills and getting married (bc it’s what my small brain thought I was supposed to do with a girl when she wanted you too), college and finally a baby comes after less than a year (a dream for me, but bc she knew I wanted to get our lives started she didn’t tell me for a week bc she thought I was going to leave her, well.. hard no). Life goes on. We have miracle #1, we struggle, we make it. Ya ya, bla bla. 


Well...this is the tough part. I haven’t had the opportunity to say it, and I’ve flat out said I wouldn’t live to see it but...acceptance. 

So we’ve been married 6 years now, and she’s been with her boyfriend for a little over a year...and tomorrow they get to welcome miracle #2 into the world. I’m truly happy for them. 

It’s pathetic, it’s petty, and it’s %1000 selfish but...it’s really hard. 

Sorry if this is choppy in sense-making, I’m not trying to share a whole book and it’s difficult to portray how important my sense of family is without sounding increasingly pathetic, however it was my sole goal and reason for building and earning from the time I was a child to way after I should have realized it was lost. And it did me good when I had a family to come home too. But tonight I’m not doing good with just sticking to myself, I needed to share it. And tomorrow’s the day. 


Anyways, Sorry for the depressing vibes, I release  you back to the Light that is reddit.",21Oct2020,1
5,"Today is my cake day! 4 years of Reddit and I just want to thank everybody that contributes in any way to make Reddit everything that it is. This is the place where I can ask anything and get real answers, get assistance when all has failed, be cheered by pictures, memes and stories, find strength and wisdom from people who share without a second thought. It's where I find kindness, generosity, and real honesty. It's an adventure, a sanctuary, a place of wonder and magic, and also of fortitude, awareness, and even sadness. 

Who knows how many lives have been changed and even saved, how many hearts have been opened, how many tears have been cried, or how much comfort or joy it has brought? It's too much to acknowledge everything it is to everybody. 

These past 4 years have been so difficult, I lost my mom, became severely disabled, and spent every penny of my savings to survive. But I am grateful and humbled by the people of Reddit for all they have given me, from food on my table to a kind word. I asked God to help me, and He blessed me with this circle of strength and comfort called Reddit. I learn something every single day, and I love every one of you.

Reddit has opened the world to me from my bedroom, I've learned of new cultures and ways of life. Come to understand and respect others in better ways, their ideologies and beliefs. It has changed me for the better.

So thank you, every one of you, for making this work for everyone! You are each a part of my world and I love each one of you. You all have given me a joyful heart and that is a wonderful gift. I make it my mission to give back as much as I can, but it will never equal what I have gained. Best cake day ever!",21Oct2020,1
6,"My leasing office called and told me that they had submitted my name along with a report to the police department because a resident threatened one of the trash valet workers because he was parked in front of her car . The resident was supposed to be me but it turns out that it was a case of mistaken identity because the leasing office lady later calls me back and says that they had the wrong person but they’ve already sent all of my information , along with a police report . The worker also took a picture of my car and sent it in to the leasing ladies and said that it was me but once again later said that it wasn’t my car. Can I sue them or no??

9,"Not the redit karma but the one irl you get by doing good things for the universe and people.

My step sister avoided an accident not to long ago, but messed up her truck in the process. Insurance only paid half and she will have to pay the rest.

They sent me a lot of hateful messages because my dad couldn’t afford to pay the rest himself, and I told him there was no way he could eat the cost of repairs for a vehicle he can’t and does not use. Especially when the owner is said vehicle is more then capable of covering the repair herself.

Earlier today a guy ran a stop light and ran his car into the side of my truck!

He was okay enough to come yell and threaten me for what seemed like a hour before the cops and ambulance came. I had a panic attack before speaking to the cops and giving my side of things.

I was good to go home as my truck had another big dent in it and the door could not be open from the damage done. The other guys car was not drivable and got pulled into a flat bed to be taken away.

Had my dad deal with the guy’s insurance while I tried to clam down. So now I am getting my truck fixed at not cost to me according to my dad.

Is this from a built up of good karma? Or maybe a guardian angel?",21Oct2020,1

11,"I didn't really want to post this in relationship advice because frankly it's not ""juicy"" or drama fuelled. It's just my life and I would like genuine advice.

I've been feeling very lonely recently. I have an amazing partner who loves and nurtures me but I still feel lonely and misunderstood. I come from a broken family, so I know that it has to do with that. I've also been hurt by a friend but I don't really know if my feelings are valid and I feel stupid if I say them out loud to another friend. Basically I became good friends with Elise who lives with my partner Ben. I've known Elise for 3 years and for the first 2 years we were quite close. I'd come over and hang out with her and we would have fun, albeit it would be a bit awkward sometimes one on one but I never minded too much. She's a lot of fun and I really enjoyed spending time with her and listening to her. Elise has BPD and I talked to her through those times where she wanted to self harm, when she went to mental health hospital ect. Elise reciprocated friendship for the first part and I was happy with our friendship. As time went on I could tell she was getting ""bored"" of me. Elise is in her mid 20's but behaves very much like a 17 year old, which I had for years tried to look past because I wanted to be patient with her mental illness. But as time went on that behaviour started to affect me. To the point I would snap at her. It's so complicated and hard to explain her personality and behaviour. For example if she has a drama going on in her life (friend or boy stuff) she wants the whole room to listen. So I would give advice but she would just reply with push backs and reasons why not to choose the logical option. This started to frustrate me on a personal level. I worked really hard to break free of my bad choices and toxic mindset and to hear her work the opposite way really just got to me. I would start to ask her why are you choosing the option that isn't healthy for you and she didn't like that I didn't play into her games. I also started to realise she barely knew anything about me. This realisation actually really hurt me. It made me feel lonely. For a while I considered her to be one of my closest friends, but the smoke screen started to dissipate and I started to see her flaws more clearly. I also feel really guilty speaking about her like this, because I'm not perfect either and I have my problems. I have trouble with some friends and I often get really angry and upset at them in my head and start to snap at them. Basically our friendship has disintegrated and of course we are still friends and I see her very often but I keep my space and put up my boundaries as I cant listen to her drama/stories anymore. I cant help but feel hurt but also feel stupid for feeling hurt. I also dont want to paint her as an AWFUL person because I know typing it all out makes her sound evil but she's not, it's more balanced than that I just think it comes down to being selfish really. I guess I feel a bit used and forgotten. I've been burnt a few times by friends in the last 4 years so I realise im extra sensitive. When I see her with other friends having fun I do feel jealousy and thats a crap emption i'd like to curb, and Im aware these friends play into her games/listen to her drama therefore she gives them more attention but i still cant kick that feeling of feeling forgotten. Its weird I know whats happening logically but i still feel quite emotional about it.

Basically I just want to learn to let go and move on. I don't want to be good friends because I think I've outgrown her but I want to move past the hurt. If anyone got this far. What do you think?",21Oct2020,1
12,"So I’m a 25 yo female and I’ve been smoking weed since high school about 17 yo. When I was about 19 to 21 I was smoking heavily, like everyday almost all day. Smoking a lot of flower and a lot of wax. Well I got pregnant when I was 21 and quit obviously throughout the pregnancy and started smoking again when she baby was about 3 months old. I had 2 more babies after that and repeated the same cycle. Well recently I found out that smoking weed regularly from a young age can lead to schizophrenia. Well my dad has schizophrenia.... and my chances double because of that... this freaked me the f out so bad that I quit cold turkey. I have 3 brothers and we all smoke heavily. Them more than me. So I let them know and talked to them but I don’t think they’re going to quit like me, which i don’t expect them too because it can be hard. Well smoking weed for so many years I miss it.. It’s a crazy life here at home with 3 kids under the age of 5 and at night when they’re all sleeping I like to relax and smoke. But only during the night. I have a question that maybe someone can shed some light on. I don’t want to quit smoking entirely only at night and maybe not everyday. But I’m terrified of developing schizophrenia. I don’t show any signs at all , is there a high chance I can develop it even if I don’t smoke everyday maybe only weekends? Is that still too much?

My parents and I are ~fine~ but have had a few explosive fights lately. I’m growing further from my friends even though I know it’s me being a hermit. I know the way I’m acting isn’t helping the way I’m feeling but idkkkk how to get out of it.

16,"My parents got divorced when I was young and my Mom has definitely struggled a lot more than my Dad. She eventually found my Stepdad and they were married for 10 years, had two kids who are my half siblings that I adore and love to death. One is a 14 year old girl and the other is a 6 year old boy. 

I always felt bad for them because I live with my Dad who is much better off financially then my Mom, so they live a more poverty level lifestyle than me. It has always been my goal to end up helping them out.

Well he recently cheated on my Mom with someone at her own workplace, who was her manager. This in turn, created a very shitty work environment for my Mom who had to quit. Then, my Stepdad left the house to go live with her and sees his kids like once a month now. It is so fucking pathetic.

He doesn't even pay child support anymore and my Mom asked him if he could buy my little 6 year old brother some new shoes because he has holes in his other ones. He said he can't afford it... shoes for 6 year olds are like 60 DOLLARS MAX!!! 

My Mom hasn't had the best habits her whole life with drinking and mental illness. I resented her for a long time when I was young but understand more now that I am older. She loves her children and busts her ass 10 hours a day delivering food just to make ends meet. 

Well guess what. I am 22 years old and although I am a broke college student with pretty low money too, I ordered him the freshest pair of Nikes that he loves with my own money. He will know he can go to his big brother far away if he even needs anything. 

Someone has to be the man of that house. Eventually I will buy them everything I can.

17,"Writing the entire story here, well, is impossible. So many details and events to understand, so I'll sum it up.

The person I've been courting for a year and a half told me, after all this time, that they don't see themselves dating me and just want to fool around. Just, out of the blue in our conversation on the phone.

When he said that, I felt pain in my chest - actual, physical pain - and it shocked me. I said, ""oh sure, yeah, that's how I see it too"". What else could I say? I had to continue what we had planned, and I had to hide my crying the whole time. I still hurt, and everything seems muted and gray.

After the first few months that we knew each other, I thought that there was something there. They moved on to things after that time period that I wasn't ready for, but I went along because I hoped that it was a step into the right direction. It wasn't, because it helped no one but them. I was selfish to believe that we could become something else. I was stupid because I wasted a year and a half on someone who never felt that way at all. 

I wish I could get the courage to just tell them how I feel and then forget everything, but I know that I won't be able to. I'm stuck here, with them, forced to be reminded of the mistakes I made. And I think my heart is aching because everything I felt, and hoped, suddenly vanished. I can't trust anyone with me anymore; this is a complete romantic reset.

I never want a fwb again. And I don't want to like someone for a long, long time.",21Oct2020,1

19,"I only had one friend when this semester started because all of my other friends couldn’t come back to campus due to covid. A few friends were stuck in other countries like China.

A lot of other friends decided they wanted to do the semester online, so they stayed in the states where their family lives. 
  
My one friend and I were pretty close and we did a lot of activities together, but I still felt kind of lonely because I didn’t have more close friends in my life. I had a few other friends (maybe like four) who were on campus, but we mostly just texted and rarely hung out. 
  
And this week, I made two new friends and we’re becoming very close! We started going to the gym together every other day, and then getting dinner after. We hang out a lot too. We had a movie night the other day and had a sleepover at my place. Now we’re making plans for Saturday.

20,"It may never seem like it's a big deal when you're turning 20. But sometimes, and especially now, for some people, it is. 20 is young still, but it's jarring realizing that your teens are over. That there's still so much life stretched before you and you don't know what to do with it. That you haven't found purpose. That 20 is a lifetime for someone who hasn't seen more. And 20 is a lifetime for those who can't see themselves with more.

It's jarring to realize that your life has been stagnant for a while now. No growth, no change in oneself. That the ups and downs behind you blend into grey and all that stretches ahead of you is grey. 

It's jarring to see the wishes that other people send you. It's warming to see the wishes that other people send you. You've made an impact in their life beyond what you realized. It hits you. When will that ""light that you give everyone"" finally come to your life? When will you feel the impact from others on you? 

Why must the grey wash the warmth out?

To be asked ""all this just from turning 20?"" Sometimes it's the change of a number on a screen, a change from a 1 and a 9, to a 2 and a 0, to realize what you've been feeling all this time. To materialize everything.

It's a small switch, a trigger. I always say ""it's the small things."" The small things that bring joy, happiness, a smile to ones face. It's the small things that bring sadness, hurt and despair. It's the small things that worm their way into your head and eat you up from the inside. I guess, it's the small things that make the big things hit harder.

It's weird to think that these are supposed to be the best years of your life. They haven't been. These are the years when one to grows into themselves. When will it happen? Will it ever happen?

When will the time come where I no longer watch time pass by, watch life pass by, from a corner. From my corner. Watching my own life from a distance. For time takes no prisoners. Time waits for no one. Life moves on whether you are living, or are just alive. But why must it move so fast? 

I guess time will heal. I've made it this far, I can make it further. Maybe time will tell. Whisper the sweet nothings that keep you going.

However, if you've made it this far, darling reader, thank you for taking the time for what is one lapping wave in a tsunami of thoughts and feelings. Thank you for being some of the warmth in the greyness. 

It seems that through this all, as I turn 20,  the thought of the self comes to mind, with one question coming up every so often: 

When will I be seen for who I am
And not what I was made?

But the irony of this all. All the thoughts of the unknown. Maybe that's what life brings you. A chance to appreciate the small things as you figure things out. To understand. To make your own way.

As I write this, I look up, it's helped getting everything down, it's not so bleak. This shouldn't sound so bleak. But I still want to share. Life is shared, time is shared. And so, just maybe, it's not all grey.

For deep in the chasms of the mind; amidst the torrential downpour of thoughts, there's that warmth. And that warmth has an echo. And that echo is whispering ""soon."" 

And so life continues. It'll all pass. 

Soon.",21Oct2020,1

30,"I want to cast a wide net on advice about this so I'm posting this here too.

Disclaimer: it's going to be a bit long for proper context. 

About a year ago, I met a guy in class and we hit it off very well. We went out to lunch/dinner almost every week for the rest of the semester (October 2019-Decemeber 2019). Before I met him, I didn't truly understand what having ""chemistry"" meant.

But there's a catch to this sweet story from a year ago.

Back then, I had just gotten into an exclusive break with my ex. We fought over a core issue in our relationship, and he wanted to take a break while I get the proper mental health help he wanted me to get. When I say exclusive, this was because he gave me conditions like how I can't date other guys, but we must sit one seat apart in classes, etc. The very next week was when I started going out with this guy. So in a nutshell, I wasn't even properly broken up when I started this. 

How this started initially was because he was helping me out with music theory, and I gave him lunch boxes from my workplace as a thank you. He was then super insistent on taking me out to lunch as a thank you for those lunch boxes (I kept saying ""oh it's okay it's okay"" and mildly rejecting it because again I didn't want to start anything while I was on break, but I gave in). After that is history. 

Now there's another catch to this; we didn't know each others ages until maybe the second or third time we went out. I thought he was around my age, he thought I was older. Back then, I was 19F and he was 27M. But we kept going out anyway despite this, up until I sent a text where all my guy friends still look at me in disbelief for sending:

""Hey, just wanted to let you know I actually low key had a crush on you for a bit, but I decided to focus on myself and potentially getting back together with the guy I'm on break with. Thanks again for the lunch!""

Basically, around this time he seemed to get a little distant and I got scared he found out about my feelings. So I cut it off before he can. Turns out not only did he not realize that I had feelings at all, he also allegedly wasn't intending to start a relationship but rather was hoping to be good friends. I was satisfied, since guys sometimes get extremely awkward once they realize girls have something for them, and I was really grateful that he was okay with being good friends with me.

By this point the dinners and lunches kept going, partially because he would keep paying for them and I would always tell him that I'd pay for the next meal. I still owe him dinner from back when everything wasn't shut down before COVID. Since we were friends as he said, I wanted it to be equal so that it didn't seem like I was exploiting him for free meals (not that cheap either-- sometimes the tab went up to $40+).

In addition, towards the end we had aggressively friendzoned each other. What I mean by this is that we would both verbally confirm that we weren't interested in one another as romantic partners and would refer to one another as though we were siblings. But I liked it that way too, it was nice having a good friend. 

Right around winter break, I got together with someone in the same department. He congratulated me, since he had been listening to my qualms about being single for months by that point. However when the semester started, everything just became progressively ""off.""

Because we're in the same small department, we had pretty much all the classes plus a few ensemble groups together. Admittingly, his actions didn't bother me too much at first because I was smitten by the new guy back then, but I noticed that he had became progressively and noticeably colder than before. It was nothing like what we had just two months prior. It was even more awkward especially because we would be in the same chamber music group, and he would be abnormally silent or distant towards just me. I was hurt, also confused because I thought we had agreed to be friends and suddenly what I thought we had was gone.

After this, I completely dropped him. I didn't want to force a friendship on someone who didn't seem to want it.

Few weeks into the semester, I ended up breaking up with the new guy, which was accompanied by massive drama but that's another story. Right after, we went into COVID shutdown so I had no actual contact with the 27 year old guy for months.

I thought my saga with him has ended. However...

Right around three weeks ago, he texted me out of the blue (given the context) about how I was doing. I'm assuming that this came from one of my statements that I made in a group project whatsapp where I mentioned ""sorry y'all, I had something unexpected that came up, I'll do my part tonight."" I remember that day was absolutely surreal, because we were having an actual continuous conversation for the first time in now close to 6 months. He was engaging, asking questions about my life and classes etc. That day ended, and because it ended with my text I thought it was just a fluke and left it at that.

Next day, I get another text about schoolwork. Because again we're in a small music department, we're pretty much in the same classes. I answer, and that's that.

Next day, another text. And for a few days now he's been texting me pretty much daily with occasional long convos. Last Sunday we were pretty much texting the entire day while I was at work.

Basically, it's a mixture of simple homework questions and a longer convo depending on which day it is.

There's slightly more context that can be added where I think it's relavant. Back when we were still kind of engaged last winter, my best friend in college has actually approached him about how he thinks of me etc. What I heard from him was that there were two major reasons why he didn't want to do anything with me:

1. Age and 2. He thought that he was the ""rebound,"" since we stated talking not even a week after we got into break. 

My question to whoever was kind enough to read this far, is that what is the logic here? I am thoroughly confused mainly because I thought he had explicitly stated he wasn't looking at me as a potential partner (he said this verbatim in a text message a year ago). Does he simply want to reconnect with me as friends again? If so why did he cut off contact with me for months? Because I get a notification from him pretty much everyday now, it's getting to my head. Combined with the nostalgia I have during this season because of the sweet memories associated with it.

31,"Im a Brit living in Germany. Covid has prevented me from seeing my family in over a year now. In that time my grandmother died of covid complications and her existing medical conditions, my grandad died of lymphoma and now it looks like the wife of my now deceased grandad; is now in the process of dying. 

I wasn't bale to say goodbye to my other grandparents. I couldn't attend their funerals because of covid and travel restrictions. Also in the last year I've missed so many important events and occasion with my family because the UK hasn't been taking covid seriously and Germany has been restricting travel. Our daughters 1st birthday, our first wedding anniversary and my brother's 30th birthday, just a few of the things we've not had a chance to share.

We originally planned to spend Christmas with them, but Brexit and covid threaten to keep us in the UK if we did that. So we plan to go in November to see my family and hopefully give me a chance to see my grandmother. 
But it looks like, again, the UK covid situation may prevent us from going. 
My family live in a ""tier 2"" covid alert region currently and if we go and stay with my mother, we'll be classed as a ""support bubble"" and so we can still go. However, it's looking increasingly more likely that more and more regions will be going ""tier 3"" within a few weeks. So we don't know if we should still go.

It's driving me insane that I haven't seen my family in so long. It's even cause numerous arguments between my husband and I. Plus my sister is starting to blame me for not visiting and not being there for the funerals etc. So if we don't go to the UK and if I don't see my grandmother before she dies, I don't think I'll psychologically cope with it anymore.

49,"I really want to get this off my chest, I'm not necessarily looking for advice but I can't tell anybody that I know about this right now.

We're both in our early-mid thirties (I am a man, she is a woman), and been dating for less than a year. It's been a ride - we fell in love fast, and discussed that we'd like it to go further and have kids one day - and COVID has definitely sped things up. We live together now. But as time has gone on, we've gotten to know each other better in various ways and there are some aspects of her personality, behaviour and viewpoints that make me uncomfortable and have given me doubts about the suitability of our relationship.

Whenever I've tried to talk to her about our differing views on a couple of specific issues, she gets emotional, angry and sometimes a bit spiteful - this is not at all how I deal with disagreements. I prefer to stand back, look at it from the outside and try to leave emotion out of it until all the cards are on the table so that everybody listens to each other. When we argue, she often interrupts me, puts words in my mouth or assumes the worst from what I'm saying. She has acknowledged that she has acted very hurtfully in one of our arguments, and apologised for this. I'm also no saint though - a couple of our arguments came out of situations where I'd been inconsiderate.

Mostly though, we have a great relationship. Apart from the couple of instances I mentioned, we've supported each other really well, and we have had a lot of fun. She's incredibly sweet most of the time and is always doing things to make me happy. I try to do the same for her. I enjoy her company and she enjoys mine, and I think, if we can leave behind the few disagreements that we have, we can have a really successful relationship.

As I said in the title - she might be pregnant. She's about 3 days late on her period. We usually use protection, but we do from time to time get a little sloppy, so it wouldn't be inconceivable (pardon the pun) that she'd gotten pregnant. I've told her that whatever happens I'll stick by her, and that made her feel better. I don't think she'd want to get an abortion, and I don't think I would either. It's probably nothing, it's probably just one of those odd periods where it's a little late, but I am still a little nervous and. I don't feel ready to take on a responsibility like that, but when I go through it all 'on paper' (figuratively speaking) I am in a relatively OK position to raise a child, and I really think I'd be a great parent. And, to be honest, I think she would be too.

I guess I just kind of hoped that this would happen on purpose, rather than by accident, and that maybe I had a chance to decide whether I really, really wanted this or not. This isn't how I imagined this going. But on the other hand, maybe I'm being picky... maybe I need to accept that we're not going to be the perfect couple all of the time, but we can still make a really good go at it.

Thanks for reading, if you did. I'm sure I left some things out, but mainly I feel good for being able to tell this to anybody, and to put my thoughts into words.",21Oct2020,1
50,"Friday night I got sick, it started with a pain in the right side of my stomach and nausea. Saturday night it turned it worse pain and vomiting, Sunday and Monday it got so bad I immediately vomited up any liquid I drank, I had constant hot flashes and chills, and I couldn’t stay awake for more than a few hours at a time. The worst sickness I’ve ever felt. I thought surely it just a stomach bug I’ll just stay in the next few weeks so I don’t get anybody sick and let my body deal with it.



This morning I woke up uncontrollably vomiting. The girls in the other duplex unit is an ER nurse, and heard me violently puking all morning and texted me telling me I sounded pretty bad and that I should probably go to the ER. I have some sort of stubbornness against going to the doctors even though I have insurance, but I decided now was probably the time I have literally never felt this sick in my life.



Well after 7 hours in the ER and one cat scan later in turns out one of my kidneys was infected. It most likely got infected because I let my body heal on its own when I got a UTI. So all of this could’ve been avoided if I would’ve just treated a fucking UTI. And all of this could’ve at least been made a lot better if I decided that puking every fluid that’s hit my stomach was a pretty good sign to call it and just see the doctor.



I’m just always afraid that I’m overreacting, and there’s nothing that’s seriously wrong with me, and the doctors will think I am a silly time wasting hypochondriac.

53,"The first SARS-COV-2 infection in my state was on March 3, 2020. Ever since I and my friends have been adamant about staying distant and wearing masks. But I absolutely hate every agonizing minute of it. I've told this story a million times, but lemme explain a little bit about myself: I am 29 and was raised in an emotionally neglectful household. My parents never spent time with me as they were always at work and were distant and cold when they were around. My older sister was always out partying, and I was too ""dull"" to make friends as a kid. This, along with having skipped several grades and having Asperger's Syndrome, made it very difficult to socialize as a kid.

I feel like I didn't get a childhood - no sleepovers or playdates, and I actually wasn't hugged until I was 17. So, in 2010, I graduated college with degrees in microeconomics, personal finance, and accounting, got a job at a local accounting firm, and in March 2011, purchased my own home. The following month, I chose to recreate my lost childhood by spending my free time eating childish foods like pop tarts, chicken nuggets, apple juice, and cotton candy, watching cartoons like Adventure Time, and later We Bare Bears and Steven Universe, jumping in bouncy houses and on hopper balls, and cuddling stuffies.

Between 2011 and 2013, I made a collection of friends who engage in these activities with me. One was raised in an ultra-orthodox Shia Muslim house and never got to spend time doing childish things because they were deemed ""sinful,"" one is a transgender woman who spent her childhood suppressing who they were, and the other is just a normal woman who wants to stop adulting every now and again. We are 29, 28, 28, and 26 respectively.

We haven't hugged in 7 months. We haven't snuggled watching cartoons in 7 months. We haven't shopped together at a mall impulsively buying any clothes we want in 7 months. I just wanna cuddle, hug, kiss, and give them raspberries again. I miss affection. We're already planning on what we'll do when this is all over (which Fauci is saying should be September 2021 or so.) We're thinking we'll get together after work on a Friday afternoon, have a bunch of hopper ball races and spend hours jumping in my bouncy house, have dinner at this nice Japanese restaurant near my house, come home, bake some brownies, and binge-watch every episode of Steven Universe, along with several seasons of We Bare Bears and Adventure Time together while stuffing our faces with chocolate brownies.

However, I feel like I start discussions that I don't wanna have and write comments and opinions about things I'm actually not that certain about.

Kinda like Trump posts stuff on Twitter when he's mad, I post stuff on Reddit. A lot of stuff I said was racist and angry, hateful and cruel. And I honestly can't take everything back I said, because there are certain things I actually do feel really angry about.



The point is that I tend to make an unfinished opinion out of thoughts, like you only had a few pages but try to stretch it to the length of a book.



I think in all honesty and respect for myself, that I should just calm down in some situations and keep it to myself.



Yes, this is anonymous, but chances are someone finds out who I am in RL or sees my reddit account and might find one of those posts (I usually delete them but it still feels bad to give space to that negativity in the first place).

I think I've reached a milestone! I've been filming and posting videos of myself talking about various issues for more than a month now. And it's not as bad as I thought it would be!
I am proud of myself.

That's all. You can watch my videos, too, if you want.

Peace!",21Oct2020,1

Since joining med school many of my friends and colleagues have been claiming I have 'photographic' memory.

Just for a bit of background, I am now a third-year medical student and I came from a normal comprehensive school. I barely do any revision to keep up with university at all (only attended a few lectures this year and managed to get the top percentile after reading some books). I have an amazing eye for detail as I often find myself correcting my teachers and professors - sometimes they disagree with me but I always come up with research/proof for my claims and indeed they change their mind.

I try and want to stay as humble as I can - I don't want to be sound cocky at all - but so many people in med school always ask me how do I know so much and most of my professors/consultants have been surprised by my level of knowledge. For this reason, sometimes I feel as if I'm different in some way.

I would never consider my memory as perfect though and I definitely wouldn't use the word 'photographic'. My long-term semantic memory is excellent (recall of facts, figures, concepts) however my episodic (what happened last night for example) and procedural are merely average.

It's interesting though as research in hyperthymesia often shows a correlation between it and an obsessive-compulsive pattern of thought and I definitely do find myself thinking about medicine all day - although I never actually have to do any work to remember the stuff. So far I've gone through med school without actually making any notes and I'm now in my third year starting clinical placements.

So ask away! I am curious as to what questions you guys will have for me :)",21Oct2020,1

97,"a few years ago my grandfather died and grandma was left to deal with finances for the first time in her life. mentally she was always sharp but in the months after his death she was so vulnerable. during this time some phone scammers managed to get her locked into a contract so she had to pay an extra $500/mo for electricity. i was royally pissed to say the least. worst of all, i couldn't do anything about it. eventually she was able to get out of the contract but not before she paid them thousands of dollars.

-

as revenge, when someone tries to scam me i waste as much of their time as possible. i figure if i can slow them down for just 10-20 min it might be saving some other poor old lady from being taken advantage of. when i first started it wasn't easy. i could only keep them on the line for a few min before i broke down and started swearing at them. then i learned to keep my cool but they have ways of figuring out who is legit so i could only keep them on the line for 5 min before they would hang up. it sort of became a game where i would slowly figure out what they wanted to hear. with each call i get a little better. today i managed to keep them for 30+ min before they got frustrated and hung up.

if everyone did this it would slow them down a lot. many old ladies would be saved.",21Oct2020,1

108,"I am currently entering the 5th year of my first job out of college and I hate it. I think this company has way too many managers, and everyone outside of management doesn’t make very much money, so in turn nobody does a particularly good job at anything. This just leads to every day being total chaos and stress/rushing around. I am the IT department, and I rarely have a phone call with users who aren’t straight up rude to me. Worse of all I am still a junior in job title and salary, but my seniors all got laid off a few years ago, so I get none of the benefits of being a junior. Is the grass greener on the other side?

I was not sure where to post and always find this community to be a beneficial and helpful resource. 
I am completing a project and am required to interview a community elder of a different ethnic background than myself. I am multiracial - my mothers side was dominantly white and my fathers Native American. 
The interview itself is largely informal, outside that I do have some questions planned and will be documenting your response. It will be more of a conversation and exploration of your background.

SO if you are an ethnicity other than my own, are an older adult (50+), have a free hour prior to next Wednesday, and are willing to talk at length about your life experience, etc. Please send me a PM and we can set up a way to communicate. (:

Thank you!",21Oct2020,1

I've been here two months and I've gotten really close with this girl, and if i were to stay I'd imagine we'd get pretty serious. We've talked about extremely personal things with one another as well as admitted our feelings and all that is great, but I hate University, and everything else here.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to lose her at all but we live in different countries and long distance would never work. We'd never see eachother again. Fuck, i'm just conflicted.

I will submit the form but i do not know how to break it to her. I've lied and said that I'm going home for a few weeks as there is a lockdown here but I'll be back, but how do i tell her that I will never come back and we'll most likely never see one another again (as lockdowns, distance, etc).

116,"Two years ago, I was dumped by a man I'd dated for 5 years and built a life with. Though I didn't want to admit it then, the relationship was horrendous and my partner was both physically and verbally abusive.  

For the past two years, he has periodically re-entered my life.  Each time, I was convinced that he would be better. Each time ended in abuse.  Truth be told, I let him back in time and time again, and even though his returning destroyed any progress I had made with self-esteem or depression, I allowed him to come back. 

Well today, I ended all of that. A few weeks ago, after he had popped up randomly looking for physical affection, I blocked his numbers and promised myself out loud that if he made contact in any other way, I would not respond. 

Well kids, today I fulfilled that promise.  He wrote me from a random number, giving me  the same lines that normally worked, tempting me with the same bait.  This time, though, I deleted the messages.

I know many of you won't see this as an accomplishment. Hell, even I know this seems small.  Please believe me when I say that the temptation of bringing him back into my life was like the lure of cigarettes or drugs, but just like those addictions, I know that giving myself permission to reconnect will just end in physical pain and a broken spirit.

I am going to keep making progress on valuing my own mental health. I am going to be courageous and try to be strong. I will hold myself accountable and keep promised I make to myself.

125,"Throwback to three months ago, my life was a mess. I didn't have a job, my parents took money that I saved up, I failed my one year course so no further education other than high school, the course was paid by my toxic parents--$1060 debt, I didn't have a drivers license, no therapy for all the trauma, no friends due to isolation, gained so much weight and insecurities slowly started piling in.

 My mental health was spiralling down so fast to the point where I started again with cutting and bad addictions---I was a year free, and the guilt that consumed me afterwards for failing was suffocating, but I couldn't stop. My brother would constantly ask me what I was doing with my life. I had absolutely nothing done. Every time he asked me I fell into such rage which would suddenly switch off and in return just numbness. I couldn't decide what to do. I felt like I was going insane. Everyone else seemed to have their life sorted out, so why was it so hard for me to do the same? 

Back to the present, today I had my first interview from a shop that I gave my CV ages ago. I didn't expect them to call, and it took me by surprise. I looked up online for common questions, wrote them down and prepared for the interview like my life depended on it,(well it did lol). No less than two hours after the interview, I get a phone call saying that they would love me on their team, do I accept?

I said heck yes, unable to believe that I was taking my first step towards the life that I wanted. This week, I applied for college, asking if it was still possible to apply, vacant places etc. They said that I still could. I applied for a course I was passionate about and was able to get a grant to sustain me without the help of my parents. I also made a different bank account in my name, added a savings account that my parents don't know about.

To all of you out there that feel like it won't get better, I promise you that it does, this was all in the space of two weeks. Two weeks that changed my life altogether. I still haven't reached all my goals, but I'm slowly getting there. I can't wait to for this new experience. Your life will start to go in the direction you want as long as you put the effort in. Get up no matter how hard it is and keep going forward only to look back when you can't believe how far you have come.  You'll get there.  I wish you all the best.",21Oct2020,1

128,"When I was a child I was so genuinely lonely. I'd sit on the playground by myself, never talk to anyone in my classes or outside of school. I had no friends. Time went on and I began to make more and more friends, but I still felt alone like I didn't fit in. I had multiple friend groups to sit with at lunch, and I often chose to sit alone. In my senior year I'd literally sit with a group and just play on my DS the whole time. 

I spent a lot of time playing games with people, hanging out taking drugs with people. Interacting with so many people online and offline for large amounts of time, but I don't feel a deep connection to these people. I genuinely used to think I could just be friends with everyone, and would always try to reach out and be friends with everyone, but I always felt unappreciated. Right now I'd say my best friends are the people I interact with on discord everyday. I feel so disconnected from all of my irls. I have no desire to interact with them. If we hang out irl there is literally nothing to do, and I don't really have that much in common with them compared to my online friends, but I've known them for a long time and they say they have my back. Yet whenever i'm downbad and text/call/or ask to hang out they're never around. They always flake on me, which makes me feel so worthless. These people say they ride for me but when the time comes that's never true. I have a friend of 14 years, and we're planning on getting a place together, and I get along with him and trust him to pay bills and shit so that's not a big deal, but he neglects me and takes me for granted. He only has one other friend besides me, and all he cares about is his gf. It takes him an entire day to respond to a text, and I can talk to him if I can get a hold of him with a phone call, but he never picks up the phone either, so like I'm his ""best friend"" but he's not mine because my needs go unmet. Like I'm so emotionally needy and crave a lot of attention and my irls simply cannot offer that, so I consider them my true friends less and less. I trust them because I've known them for a long time, but I don't really feel a connection to them like I do my online friends who I interact with on a daily basis.

I feel like I expect too much out of friendship. This year I made an online friend, and she was the closest I'd ever been to someone. We would text everyday for 5 months, and give each other so much mutual validation and support. I could tell her literally anything, and for the first time in life I didn't feel alone. We would tell each other we loved each other, but I felt insecure. She would take a long time to text back a lot of the time, and had a lot of other people in her dms, and would just answer her msgs starting from the top of her inbox. My feelings of not mattering to her, and wanting more attention ruined our friendship. I spent the past 6 months missing her and feeling so much regret. Recently we reconnected and things are ok between us, but it's not very meaningful. She'll text me back like once every 24 hours, but idk.

I just feel like the level of care and attention I desire is limited to relationships, and I've just been incapable of getting into one. I feel so insecure and it ruins my friendships, I desire so much attention and people are just incapable of giving that to me. My online friends currently are really talented, cool, and funny. They openly tell me they love me which my irls never did, but it's just sad to me how temporary everything is. People are just constantly gonna rotate in and out of my life.",21Oct2020,1

130,"And I voted for Jo Jorgensen. Don't tell me it is a vote for Trump. Don't tell me I'm wasting my vote. I could say the same if you live in a red state but vote blue anyway. You can't expect change while dissuading it. If Trump wins, it is on the democrats for running a lackluster candidate. Not on me for voting what aligns most with me. I would have voted for Bernie.  

So why did I not vote for Biden? It probably comes down to disillusionment and resentment with the way things are run. This image of Joe as honest, compassionate, the hope from despair just feels dishonest. I'm tired of the old white men playing politics, saying whatever to secure your demographic, and then throwing you scraps when in power. I don't want to contribute to partisanship and a flawed system. Many others feel the same cynicism. 

I get it. Trump is dangerously incompetent. And things are complicated. I am probably being unfair to Joe (but it's really not about him). I don't believe he's corrupt, but I do think he's a political opportunist. So is Trump--but  I don't think he's racist. That's all just cancerous politics. Come Nov. 3, Biden will almost certainly win.

134," 

The fetishization of this as ""girlpower"", or as some kind of way of punishing, humiliating, violating and/or hurting the guy AS a male, or the the joy which the kind of girl who does this draws from this makes it sexual violence and humiliation, in addition to severe physical violence.

Outside of self defense, what I listed above are the EXACT reasons girls/women do this, not ""because it just happens to be what hurts the most, and his gender has nothing to do with it"". BULL. SHIT. Girls and women do this to punish and violate males AS males, and the lack of inhibition to do this is due to a lack of regard specifically for males.

Shows and movies portray this as normal, funny or no big deal between children and especially a brother and a sister, they portray it as deserved when a guy somehow insults a girl, hurts her feelings or cheats, and even movies for little children like Ice Age or the Smurfs have scenes like these, where the underlying dynamic is all about specifically showing a girl humiliate, dominate and extremely hurt a boy AS a male by exploiting and violating his male weak spot and male genitals, and it's portrayed as funny and no big deal.  
This trope has been played so incredibly often in shows and movies that the act has established itself as a ""girl-thing"", as a part of the female identity (even if it's mostly lived out vicariously) - violating and humiliating, triumphing over a male as a male by exploiting and attacking his male weak spot and genitals.

Even when there's an accidental nutshot, many girls laugh in a different way about it than guys, and even when it's completely inappropriate due to the seriousness of the particular case.  
It's not a sympathetic ""holy shit, I know how that feels, we're in the same boat"" - laughter.  
It's utterly lacking in sympathy, and comes from the satisfaction of an ill will, and resentment specifically towards males.

Girls/women who did this for any other reason than legitimate self defense should be deeply, deeply ashamed of themselves because they are pieces of shit.  
It's not a cute or funny little story.  
It's not something they did because ""they did not understand"" - they absolutely did, that's why they did it.  
What else would make them do it, except for a more general disregard for males as a whole?

Girls who kick guys in the balls hard for other reasons than legitimate self defense are not one bit better than guys who beat girls into that kind of agony and grope them. Same goes for young girls and boys.

They deserve a hard punch in the face every bit as much as guys like that, and I mean that 100% - girls who do that should be punched in the face.

And if such an attack makes a guy's testicle/s burst and have to be removed, or takes his ability to father children from him, it should be considered to be on one level with rape.",21Oct2020,1
