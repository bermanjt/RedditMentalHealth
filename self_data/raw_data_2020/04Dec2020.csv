0,"Matching with someone *really* cute on Bumble made me confront the fact that I don't know how to have and keep conversation. I can ask general and generic questions for a little while, but it doesn't take long for me to run out of ideas. Then the conversation just kind of dries out. I do this irl, too, only faster; once I run out of those smalll-talk questions, I never have any idea of what to say next. Does anyone have any advice on how to maintain conversations, irl or over messages?",04Dec2020,1
1,"I’m a 14 year old boy and I love to sing and play guitar. I always wanted to become a singer. I decided to get off my bed and actually work towards my goal. So I recently started a YouTube channel to help expose myself to the world. YouTube has been quite successful and I’m very happy with myself. A couple days ago, my parents found a record label audition for 2021 debut artist. I immediately signed up. I don’t know why but I felt like this is the path I should take.

11,"This happened around seven or eight years ago. I have only ever told family and close personal friends. But after hearing what he said about declaring martial law to hold a new election, you know what? Fuck that guy.

I served 20 years in the US Army. For 14 years of that time I served in US Embassies, attached to the Defense Intelligence Agency. It isn't as cool as it might sound. I mostly handled the budget for the military attaches and coordinated clearances for US military aircraft and ships passing through the host country's territory and supervised enlisted personnel assigned to the embassy (other than the Marine Security Guards). But Flynn was the Director of the DIA at the time, so he was my boss's boss's boss. One week he decides to visit my country of assignment, which I won't specify for obvious reasons, and I was the control officer for the visit. I drove Flynn around and made sure he had everything he needed. He has a personality very similar to Trump's, though, admittedly, he is much smarter than Trump. Not that that is saying much.

Anyway, anytime that a high ranking US official visits a country (other than places like Iraq or Afghanistan), they are required to pay a visit to the US Ambassador assigned to that country. So I, of course, arranged the required meeting between Flynn and the Ambassador. Well, during a day of driving Flynn around the capital city, and introducing him to various people, and eating lunch with him and discussing office operations, I reminded him of his appointment with the Ambassador. To which he replied, ""Hey, I hear Superman: Man of Steel is still showing here."" ""Uh, yes, Sir."" I replied. At this time Man of Steel had stopped showing in theaters in the US but was still showing in our host country. Flynn told me that he wanted to see it and didn't have time to both see the movie AND meet with the Ambassador before his private military aircraft departed country. He then instructed me to ""make up an excuse"" to get out of the meeting with the ambassador so he could go to the mall and watch the freaking Superman movie. 

LTG Flynn ordered me to lie to a US Ambassador so he could watch Superman: Man of Steel. Yeah. Did I do it? \*sigh\* Yes, I did. As much as I respected the Ambassador, the Ambassador wasn't actually in my chain of command and Flynn was. Well, kind of. Command authority in agencies like the DIA is complicated, but Flynn certainly had more control over my career than the Ambassador did as the Ambassador was State Department. It is one of a handful of things I did during my career that I felt shitty about.

But I came to understand that Flynn had a horrible work ethic, even if there were aspects of his job that he was good at. So when I heard that Trump had appointed Flynn to be his NSA my first thought was, ""This won't end well."" And as we all know now, I guessed right.

Anyway, I am retired from the Army now and Flynn is a disgrace to his country and Trump is heading out the door so I decided to go ahead and post this. Not that it matters for anything or to anyone, but I just felt like venting.

P.S. Fuck you, Mike.",04Dec2020,1

13,"*HUGE TRIGGER WARNING FOR PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING* 

You know what, life, you win. You fucking win. You always do. I've fucking snapped. 

My life was total ass shit for the first 18-20 years. As to why my life was ass shit that's WAY too long of a story, but it involves childhood sexual abuse, severe depression also in childhood, eating disorders, physical and emotional abuse by family members, and one weird as hell yet still somehow funny cult. But, I was able to finally move out and begin my life as a free adult. I graduated college, found a partner, and am excelling in my career.

And then this year happened. I thought I had gotten off easy. I still have a job. I haven't lost anyone to covid. I am mostly recovered from my eating disorder and my new meds finally put my crippling anxiety into remission. Hell, I even got covid and was completely fine and was able to work from home. But then today happened. 

I found out without a shadow of a doubt that the man I once considered to be like a father to me groomed several minors. No allegations of abuse or assault have been made, only allegations of misconduct, but in my eyes there's no fucking difference. Although I was never victimized in any way by this person, my support goes to the victims 110%. They were my peers and classmates, and I'm sorry I couldn't protect them.

I feel betrayed. I hate myself for not seeing it. This man was a family friend and widely loved in my community. They played a huge role in my life throughout my teen and college years. Literally, I would not be the person I am today had I never met them. I loved his wife and young son as well. They always supported me and my mental health. They were a huge force and reason behind my recovery, so much that the thought of hurting them deterred me from suicide. But today I blocked his number and will literally never speak to him again. I will erase his memory from my brain and one day spit on his grave if I can't. 

Now I'm numbed out. Since this is combined with all of the other bullshit my life has dredged up, my brain is sending alarm signals that my body can no longer respond. I'm not reacting the way I should and I know this will manifest in the emergence or re-emergence of one of my many unhealthy coping mechanisms, all of which I will probably be aware of but will be powerless to stop. I can't wait. As to the man I once considered an adoptive father, fuck you.",04Dec2020,1

Ok you know when you’re in a relationship and you know for a fact things will eventually turn sour (like they always do) it doesn’t matter if you’re dating, get into the dating for years stage, engaged, married, have kids. Etc. It will ALWAYS turn sour at some point and either you or the other person will be hurt.

I have those amazing memories and while they’re happening I’m the back of my mind I’m dreading so much keeping in touch with the person because it’ll happen, just a matter of when.

21,"The title is edgy ik but it’s true. My mental health is going downhill fast as fuck. And I don’t know what to do.

Since February this year I’ve started to feel more and more meaningless but in the last couple of weeks it’s become a lot worse. 

In the beginning, when I only felt a bit off, I laughed at the thought of me being depressed or hurting myself, but 2 weeks ago I cut for the first time. I’ve cut a couple of times since then and I’m disappointed in myself. I never ever thought I’d be at this point. 

I’m only 16 and still in school, something that is also extremely mentally stressful. I’ve started to skip classes, failing tests and lying to teachers. Keep in mind, only a year ago I was a straight A and B student, and now I get happy if I barely pass. 

My whole life is a fucking mess and I don’t know what to do. I’m afraid that I’ll start thinking of much worse things than just cutting. I started talking to a therapist in September, yet still my mental health has dropped and become worse. 

Everyone says that it’s gonna be ok and that it is temporary. To keep fighting and to stay strong. How the fuck am I supposed to do that? I’m already running on spare fuel and there is not a lot left. This is really the last bit of energy I’m using right now and I don’t know what will happen when I run out.

I have panic anxiety on top of this, and I feel like I’m losing my mind and going insane. I feel like I’ll get a heart attack soon or faint or whatever. I feel like my mind is tied up in knots that I can’t untie and my thoughts are a blur. I feel like I’m going to lose it. I feel like I’ll explode or something. 

At the same time I’m doubting myself. What if I’m not even depressed? What if I’ve been faking it this whole time and I have just gotten into the role? What if I’m a fucking psychopath gaslighting everyone?

24,"2,5 years ago, ocd was telling me to return home in order to get paper napkins. I did not wnat to do it. I tried to make a bad deal with Christian God like a promise bout not returning home to get napkins. I canceled the deal but I am not sure if it was canceled. What if the deal was accepted by other Gods in case Christian God is not real?

Today, I wanted to visit my grandma who lives in an apartment, a floor below. Many times when I visit my grandma, I worry about the napkin promise because sometimes, my grandma has some napkins in the house. I am mostly, worried because I leave my house to go to grandma's and the whole procedure reminds to ocd the danger of the napkin promise. So, many times I get anxious and I try not to think/see paper napkins when I enter the house. Today, I wanted to be free and normal and not worry about this anymore because I will never get napkins.

So, I started going downstairs to go to my grandma's apartment. My mind had some intrusive thoughts about the fake danger of the napkins. I just, started going downstairs in a fast normal way. While going downstairs, my ocd warned me about the napkin promise and I suppose, it started telling me to go slower and stay alert to avoid even looking the paper napkins. I ignored the thoughts and kept going downstairs with the same speed. The grandma's door was open. I pushed the door and while entering or as soon as I entered, I noticed a piece of paper on the table. I think, I randomly, made a small step forward. I freaked a little. Luckily, the piece of paper was not paper napkin.

I am a little worried and confused, because I cant remember why I made some steps towarrds it. Probably, while entering or as soon as I entered, I randomly, noticed it and because of my rush, I think, I randomly, made a step forward because I wanted to go more near the couch area which is near the table, without having any intention to go too near or touch it. But is what really, happened?

What if by trying to ignore my intrusive thoughts and act normal and due to rush, I ended up, for 1 second, with the intention to see that paper napkin, without realising it? what if by making that step I had the intention of going near that paper thing without realising it? what if for 1 second, my subconscious got confused and I ended up trying to touch the paper while imagining it that it is a paper napkin?",04Dec2020,1
25,"TL;DR It's sexist, uncomfortable for the women, and incredibly twisted. 

When I first started to feel sexual attraction...like at about age 11-12? I thought it was fucking awesome that ladies would wear such short/revealing clothes in comparison to men's. Like how short their shorts were. Skirts and dresses above the knee. Cleavage. Tight jeans. 

However, as I got older (I'm 19 now), and got more involved with politics, and found out that I myself may be gender-fluid or possibly a trans woman, I began to realize how unfair/disgusting this is. 

At first, everyone kind of wore relatively tight and revealing clothes. However, for practicality/functional purposes, men's clothes eventually became longer and baggier...while women's stayed the same, as still is to this day. 

In recent years, men's clothes have become slightly shorter and less baggy, as admittedly making them **TOO** long and baggy was an extreme, but still nowhere near as short or tight as women's.

Like when you walk into a store, the ""super ultra short shorts"" for men, 5 inch inseam, is still longest than the longest female option, which is only around 3-4 inch inseam, if even.

*Before I start, a quick message to the mods to please feel free to contact me to make any edits. Since this is your platform and you have your own rules, I don't want to cause any disruptions. I will also cross-post this to multiple subreddits because I honestly don't know which subreddit is the most appropriate to ask for help depending on my ambiguous problem.*

Hello wonderful people of Reddit ! I would really be glad if you guys understand this is my first post here and complete noob to how it works so I wanna say sorry for anything I have done wrong and would appreciate where I have gone wrong and how to correct it. Alright moving on, This is my last measure of desperation. I am gonna skip the sad backstory and focus on what my problem is. I will come off as whiny, excuse giving a shit for brains asshole so please bear with me.

TLDR: I can't achieve anything I do and the intense pressure of life is killing me from the inside. Your help is really appreciated and even if you don't want to, I guess this will be an interesting read because I am not really that articulate or interesting so you get the idea. I realize I can't do certain stuff on my own so here I am basically.

I am an 18-year-old pathetic, cowardly, desperate, weakest guy ever to exist. Seriously It is no exaggeration. I never had a single win in my life and the reason I am still alive is based on pure luck only.

Let's go deeper. This all started during Quarantine. In June, I wanted to change my life for the best so I began reading lots of subreddit posts and creating projects for myself setting deadlines and stuff to reach my goals. I even signed up for a gym ( which is trust me as an introvert is almost the end of the world situation), learned cooking on my own, and found resources to learn the subjects I love. I guess I had a perfect day or two but things kinda got out of hand.

I started my "" life-changing "" journey, started going to the gym, and did cardio rarely but almost focused on the gym for 8 months and had shit changes because I can't stick to a routine and if I even get a little late, it would become a zoo and I always feel like they will be judging me and I'll be too overthinking that my form would be wrong. Every time I had a bad day, I would reset everything from a fresh start going to sleep pressuring myself "" I will change for good "". It is about to be the end of the year and I really want to at least achieve my short-term goals before college opens up yet here I am crumbling under this pressure because I can't focus on one thing as each of my goals are kinda interconnected in terms of purpose. This doesn't mean I am learning everything seriously giving my 100%. I just do a little bit of everything trusting the concept of compound interest so I can get over my insecurity of knowing only surface-level knowledge. Basically, I am even ready to give up taking holidays on Sundays and work then because I need to do things people can't so I can get what they want ( cheesy as hell I know ). I may have reduced weight and have little to none muscle mass but I can say I have a body fat percentage of over 20% and feel really disgusting I have gained so much fat literally giving me body dysmorphia. Even If I cook my own food, I am notoriously a picky eater and don't have the time or money to buy ingredients for my meal plan. The only thing about is I never gave up on my dreams and tried to start over and over for 8 months straight.

To know my motive, we gotta go into my past. When I was 14, I started to get some interest in philosophy which really opened my eyes. As life went on, I began to see the darker side of things. To my helicopter parents who never let me join sports or take any risk essentially ripping me off from life's experiences, I am an investment to them. They want me only to pay off their debts and "" repay "" the money they poured into my ""future"". What future do you ask? It includes my school fees, college fees, etc etc. Also, I would like to mention I was never meant to be born in this world.

I know the last part is personal but hear me out, My entire family is borderline crazy. They are fucked up and insane as hell. That is all I can say. I can be more detailed but I don't think it is appropriate here for now. I was a fat overweight kid so I couldn't stand up for myself. This abusive family works psychologically to tear me apart. They would often guilt trip me to study because "" they spend so much money on my studies "" and never allowed me to go to sports or try anything new. And when I learned my mother had a miscarriage before me, it all hit me. When they were joking about how they can't afford more than 2 kids, I asked myself "" if he/she was born before, I would have never existed right now ""

Thus ladies and gentlemen were my first existential crisis. I am a weird kid at first ok? I was very short-tempered and used to pick a fight with my brother's friends showing how "" powerful "" I am ( foreshadowing ) then as days went by, I kept learning how evil people are. People I considered friends betrayed me and picked on me treating me like trash, My parents never let me learn anything new because "" why learn other than studies "". I was an introvert, had no real friends all alone dealing with all this. Till my 10th grade, it was hell. I wished I died every time I slept. I lost all meaning in everything and was just a giant body of abyss wandering aimlessly. No one cared for me, No one really loved me, I was lonely for the first time even though I was alone all this time.

When I was addicted to this solitude, I became friends with a girl, long story short she was my first friend and because of a stupid prank I did she left me which now I found out is she is a double-faced backstabber. We were almost best friends, she even told We were close. But I don't know what happened on her side of the story which brings me to my next point.

I am a good person and I hate it. I am selfless, gullible, and too loyal to my own good. I overthink a lot, am indecisive, almost no common sense, devoid of any intelligence, and most particularly, a coward. I like to imagine I have infinite repressed anger and willpower. But I have no willpower at all, am obsessive about the wrong things to the point I became a workaholic, and no resolve. I can't hold any vengeance and am really forgiving so that pisses me off since I really want to get back to people in the most harmless yet devastating way possible.

After I broke up with her, I began to dive into a spiral of self-hate and nihilism. I couldn't sleep at all. I would just stare at the clock at 2 in the morning with my lifeless eyes thinking about how death is better than what is going through my life. Then I stopped caring and it became the best moment of my life. I started taking risks, being carefree, and binging shows all day. I would study and have fun, life seemed nice until my final year of high school. I even rekindled my lost love for gaming and had a blast on my summer days and even got selected for a summer camp to Japan with 70% which felt like a dream to me realizing I am truly happy in my entire.

Until the beginning of my senior year. My parents made it clear they will not leave me alone anywhere outside my state. They will not even allow to at least try to apply to colleges in other states or Canada (which I worked so hard for ) playing the same "" we can't afford "" card even though I know they just don't want to and want to use that money for themselves. I don't blame them but still, their intentions are not pure at all. They even went as far as convincing me to get a student loan in my name which I would have agreed with if I was an idiot. I know how people suffer due to student loans and I already made up my mind so I dodged a bullet there. When I leave college, I will cut off all contact with them. Never turning back, leaving the entire family behind and stand on my own. I mentally detached myself from my family. I just live every day not knowing what is like to have a mother's love, to be guided by their father, and have a reliant brother or something. I wanted my own family so I can know what it is like to be own, like to be wanted and loved unconditionally. So to become that in this generation, obviously, I had to be talented and skilled to be well off as I am starting from scratch and I dream big, which brings me to my 3rd point.

I don't know exactly where I got this, But I am mad for power ( Remember the foreshadowing ). I would do anything pathetic and cowardly and just generally immorally disgusting things for power. It satisfies this huge insecurity of being weak and powerless. I was left helpless all alone multiple times in my life so knowing I have more power than anyone be it in form of strength or intelligence, relieved me of that stress ( foreshadowing for the last time I promise ). I wanted to never be weak again and be strong enough to survive on my own and rely on myself. As I was one of the unlucky few who had no inborn talents and circumstances royally fucked my life because I didn't have anyone to guide me. I have this itch to put powerful people down like if people talk about someone being a genius in any field be it sports or chess, I wanted them to know they should be scared of me since I don't have those yet I can go toe to toe with them. This rush made me feel like a god. Granted I dream a lot like this, I just live for the experience. My actual goal is to have fun and live the thrill even if these ideals are fucked up. I have questioned reality many times and wonder if I am in a delusion all the time and even considered going to a therapist or a psychiatrist but since I am gonna cut them off, they won't even consider giving me money without having a proper reason ( except food, almost everything you imagine is not allowed ). I even made a bet with them if I studied hard and got over 400 marks out of 500, the least they can buy me is a Chromebook. Guess what? I got 426 ( first time in my life I am seeing marks above 400 ), it might be pure luck but you can be sure I put in the work like crazy. Then when the innocent 8th grade me asked about it, they laughed at my face. I snapped and moving on to the last and final point.

I cannot rest easy knowing someone is better than me in everything and I am a pathetic loser. I want to live life to the fullest and even if I say I am ready to do anything deep inside I know I don't have what it takes to achieve my goals. But I am not gonna go down without a fight even if fate wants me to die as a loser. I would like to add I am extremely paranoid ( have nightmares or live the day in stress thinking my closed ones would die because of my actions or by evil men and I won't have the guts or skill to have my revenge // can't be away from my laptop or mobile fearing my family will sneak around my phone because there is literally no privacy and they are obsessed with what is going on in my life ), OCD I guess ( I have so many compulsive thoughts I will die if everything is not arranged or is dirty ) and no identity of self ( I have to look at my pics, my voice and even previous chats to remember who I am and what personality am shit even though I don't care about this but if I am not careful enough, I will lose all emotions and just be filled with nothingness ) I think this may or may not be useful but I thought if there were genuine psychiatrists or therapists they could guide me? I don't know, please ignore this if you think I am just thinking.

Which brings me to you guys, I want to get over my childhood demons and establish my identity as a whole and complete person. I can't really feel emotions and relationships are almost alien to me because I always think I don't deserve anything in this life until I am worthy enough. I have seen guys who can study hard, work on their personal projects, are active in sports, and still hangout. Initially, I envied them furiously but now they are my hope because if they can do it, then my goals are not impossible.

To wrap it up, I want to build great habits that improve my quality of life like listening to podcasts, learning audiobooks, etc etc, be ahead of people and learn from people's experience doing things they wished they did and for the first time in my life feel successful.

I really want to cut all the fat I accumulated, learn skills like finance and writing, start playing a musical instrument, learn java so I can get a high paid internship, or even do freelance no matter what it takes so my dream of being selected for an exchange program backed by my own money doesn't die. I have online classes now so it is damn hard to do everything at once including my other unwanted stuff like making lists of movies and such since I have stopped watching them all as my college begins. This unwanted stuff also includes getting a driver's license, and other government documents you have to apply for once you are 18.

Basically, I want to do the things I can't. I wanna work on being financially and emotionally independent from my parents, be the best, or even one of the few strongest in many fields like a jack of all trades. I don't need complete mastery, just the entire foundation, and extra skills that make it worthwhile to learn and experiment on. I still believe I don't deserve you guys help and I will fail you all even if believed in me because that is what I do I guess.

If you have made it this far, you have just known my life in almost 3000 words which I believe is absurd af. So I kindly ask you to read this when you are bored or something because I know you guys want to have fun and not listen to a pathetic loser like myself and validating yourself because you are doing better if you are just a sadist. Even if it is the latter, I don't care. Please, I don't want life to go like this anymore. Help in any way you can, it might not look like much. But trust me, it means the world to me.

I want to say thank you from my bottom of my heart even if you just read this. Even if there is a 0.5% chance, there are people like me who want help but can't go anywhere this can at least be a beacon of help. If you want more info to help, I will be glad to share if the mods allow it and if I think is appropriate enough so I don't start a witchhunt by accident.",04Dec2020,1
28,"This most recent “dating” experience just has me floored. So I met someone on match just four days ago, that first day, she messaged me like 30 times in the day, so we decided (she asked if we could do this instead of giving numbers or email) we swap Snapchat names. After that, in two days, she had sent me four selfies, telling me whiles doing this or that, she wanted me to message her. I felt like we had a vibe going! So our last convo was yesterday afternoon, I asked how her day was going and she replied that it had got better. So going back to one our convos we had before, I decide to send a pic of the mountains in my area and just saying how cool it looked and followed with “hey if you got the energy/if you’re for it, let’s chat tonight!” I did that because I wanted to hear her voice and kind of build something and not get stuck in being only texting early, that doesn’t seem to lead to much in my experience. After I did that, she blocked me on match and Snapchat. I can’t see what I did wrong! It kills me knowing i don’t feel like I got a fair shake. I’ve had a rough streak lately, and not getting a lot of “looks”. This last go around has hurt my pride and having a tough time picking myself up after this one, I’m more venting than anything else, but if you read this, I’d love some support.",04Dec2020,1
29,"The aggressive compulsory conformity and lack of individuality in American culture is so soul sucking and dehumanising and I honestly feel like I’m the only person who actively rebels against it at all times.

People here have no concept of individuality. No matter how long someone gets to know you, they will only see you through the lens of stereotypes of your arbitrary attributes, such as your sexuality, skin colour, political standing, and so much more. Your personality is confined within the limits of these attributes, and rebel against it and you get ostracised. You get in order and conform or you get cut at the throat and be cast away as maladjusted. You never get to be a person here; you are only allowed to be a caricature of the stereotypes. The lack of depth of individuality Americans showcase in their culture is so thorough that it’s almost like depth.  

How I look isn’t indicative of anything of my mannerisms or personality

My sexuality isn’t indicative of anything of my mannerisms or personality

Where I live isn’t indicative of anything of my mannerisms or personality

But yet every American I meet, these, and some others as well, are the foundation of personality. Anything outside of this is ignored and you will constantly be compared to your arbitrary stereotypes until you fulfill them. They’ll let you know how important they regard it at some point. And I’m very tired of downplaying how much I hate this mentality and how much I despise anyone who thinks like this.",04Dec2020,1

*Before I start, a quick message to the mods to please feel free to contact me to make any edits. Since this is your platform and you have your own rules, I don't want to cause any disruptions. I will also cross-post this to multiple subreddits because I honestly don't know which subreddit is the most appropriate to ask for help depending on my ambiguous problem.*

Hello wonderful people of Reddit ! I would really be glad if you guys understand this is my first post here and complete noob to how it works so I wanna say sorry for anything I have done wrong and would appreciate where I have gone wrong and how to correct it. Alright moving on, This is my last measure of desperation. I am gonna skip the sad backstory and focus on what my problem is. I will come off as whiny, excuse giving a shit for brains asshole so please bear with me.

TLDR: I can't achieve anything I do and the intense pressure of life is killing me from the inside. Your help is really appreciated and even if you don't want to, I guess this will be an interesting read because I am not really that articulate or interesting so you get the idea. I realize I can't do certain stuff on my own so here I am basically.

I am an 18-year-old pathetic, cowardly, desperate, weakest guy ever to exist. Seriously It is no exaggeration. I never had a single win in my life and the reason I am still alive is based on pure luck only.

Let's go deeper. This all started during Quarantine. In June, I wanted to change my life for the best so I began reading lots of subreddit posts and creating projects for myself setting deadlines and stuff to reach my goals. I even signed up for a gym ( which is trust me as an introvert is almost the end of the world situation), learned cooking on my own, and found resources to learn the subjects I love. I guess I had a perfect day or two but things kinda got out of hand.

I started my "" life-changing "" journey, started going to the gym, and did cardio rarely but almost focused on the gym for 8 months and had shit changes because I can't stick to a routine and if I even get a little late, it would become a zoo and I always feel like they will be judging me and I'll be too overthinking that my form would be wrong. Every time I had a bad day, I would reset everything from a fresh start going to sleep pressuring myself "" I will change for good "". It is about to be the end of the year and I really want to at least achieve my short-term goals before college opens up yet here I am crumbling under this pressure because I can't focus on one thing as each of my goals are kinda interconnected in terms of purpose. This doesn't mean I am learning everything seriously giving my 100%. I just do a little bit of everything trusting the concept of compound interest so I can get over my insecurity of knowing only surface-level knowledge. Basically, I am even ready to give up taking holidays on Sundays and work then because I need to do things people can't so I can get what they want ( cheesy as hell I know ). I may have reduced weight and have little to none muscle mass but I can say I have a body fat percentage of over 20% and feel really disgusting I have gained so much fat literally giving me body dysmorphia. Even If I cook my own food, I am notoriously a picky eater and don't have the time or money to buy ingredients for my meal plan. The only thing about is I never gave up on my dreams and tried to start over and over for 8 months straight.

To know my motive, we gotta go into my past. When I was 14, I started to get some interest in philosophy which really opened my eyes. As life went on, I began to see the darker side of things. To my helicopter parents who never let me join sports or take any risk essentially ripping me off from life's experiences, I am an investment to them. They want me only to pay off their debts and "" repay "" the money they poured into my ""future"". What future do you ask? It includes my school fees, college fees, etc etc. Also, I would like to mention I was never meant to be born in this world.

I know the last part is personal but hear me out, My entire family is borderline crazy. They are fucked up and insane as hell. That is all I can say. I can be more detailed but I don't think it is appropriate here for now. I was a fat overweight kid so I couldn't stand up for myself. This abusive family works psychologically to tear me apart. They would often guilt trip me to study because "" they spend so much money on my studies "" and never allowed me to go to sports or try anything new. And when I learned my mother had a miscarriage before me, it all hit me. When they were joking about how they can't afford more than 2 kids, I asked myself "" if he/she was born before, I would have never existed right now ""

Thus ladies and gentlemen were my first existential crisis. I am a weird kid at first ok? I was very short-tempered and used to pick a fight with my brother's friends showing how "" powerful "" I am ( foreshadowing ) then as days went by, I kept learning how evil people are. People I considered friends betrayed me and picked on me treating me like trash, My parents never let me learn anything new because "" why learn other than studies "". I was an introvert, had no real friends all alone dealing with all this. Till my 10th grade, it was hell. I wished I died every time I slept. I lost all meaning in everything and was just a giant body of abyss wandering aimlessly. No one cared for me, No one really loved me, I was lonely for the first time even though I was alone all this time.

When I was addicted to this solitude, I became friends with a girl, long story short she was my first friend and because of a stupid prank I did she left me which now I found out is she is a double-faced backstabber. We were almost best friends, she even told We were close. But I don't know what happened on her side of the story which brings me to my next point.

I am a good person and I hate it. I am selfless, gullible, and too loyal to my own good. I overthink a lot, am indecisive, almost no common sense, devoid of any intelligence, and most particularly, a coward. I like to imagine I have infinite repressed anger and willpower. But I have no willpower at all, am obsessive about the wrong things to the point I became a workaholic, and no resolve. I can't hold any vengeance and am really forgiving so that pisses me off since I really want to get back to people in the most harmless yet devastating way possible.

After I broke up with her, I began to dive into a spiral of self-hate and nihilism. I couldn't sleep at all. I would just stare at the clock at 2 in the morning with my lifeless eyes thinking about how death is better than what is going through my life. Then I stopped caring and it became the best moment of my life. I started taking risks, being carefree, and binging shows all day. I would study and have fun, life seemed nice until my final year of high school. I even rekindled my lost love for gaming and had a blast on my summer days and even got selected for a summer camp to Japan with 70% which felt like a dream to me realizing I am truly happy in my entire.

Until the beginning of my senior year. My parents made it clear they will not leave me alone anywhere outside my state. They will not even allow to at least try to apply to colleges in other states or Canada (which I worked so hard for ) playing the same "" we can't afford "" card even though I know they just don't want to and want to use that money for themselves. I don't blame them but still, their intentions are not pure at all. They even went as far as convincing me to get a student loan in my name which I would have agreed with if I was an idiot. I know how people suffer due to student loans and I already made up my mind so I dodged a bullet there. When I leave college, I will cut off all contact with them. Never turning back, leaving the entire family behind and stand on my own. I mentally detached myself from my family. I just live every day not knowing what is like to have a mother's love, to be guided by their father, and have a reliant brother or something. I wanted my own family so I can know what it is like to be own, like to be wanted and loved unconditionally. So to become that in this generation, obviously, I had to be talented and skilled to be well off as I am starting from scratch and I dream big, which brings me to my 3rd point.

I don't know exactly where I got this, But I am mad for power ( Remember the foreshadowing ). I would do anything pathetic and cowardly and just generally immorally disgusting things for power. It satisfies this huge insecurity of being weak and powerless. I was left helpless all alone multiple times in my life so knowing I have more power than anyone be it in form of strength or intelligence, relieved me of that stress ( foreshadowing for the last time I promise ). I wanted to never be weak again and be strong enough to survive on my own and rely on myself. As I was one of the unlucky few who had no inborn talents and circumstances royally fucked my life because I didn't have anyone to guide me. I have this itch to put powerful people down like if people talk about someone being a genius in any field be it sports or chess, I wanted them to know they should be scared of me since I don't have those yet I can go toe to toe with them.

Please reply about the cuisines , environment , hobbies and other things - any things about everyone or anyone. 
For example , I ( 17 ) live in Kerala ( state ) in India. Kerala is more of a countryside to anyone outside. Yet it improves and many cities and town are rising. 
My daily life includes ( during covid pandemic ) waking up at 8:00AM-9:00AM ( it depends ) and brushing my teeth after attending the online class on television. 
Then breakfast , which usually includes dishes made out of rice or wheat. 
Then online class from school. 
Then using mobile phone for YouTube , gaming , etc. 
Noon approaches and we eat somewhere at 12:00AM-2:00PM. 
Then again phone. 
Inside 3:00PM-3:45PM , neighbouring children and myself starts to play on a small clearing in a short forest of rubber trees. ( Kerala has many *small* rubber plantations ) 
It is completely different from the game played in foreign countries , right? They play in huge grounds and all in my knowledge. 
( Also , there is this ' game ' in foreign countries where parents watch the children play , right. Well I don't think there is such a thing in Kerala ) 
The playing ends in about 5:45PM and the sky would probably be dark enough. 
Then bath , light lamp ( hindu tradition ) and phone ( again ). 
Then dinner about 9:00PM ( depends , again. ) 
Then sleep after phone. 

There is no "" Snowing "" here ( oh I wish I was in foreign countries - you might have figured it from my other posts , right ). No "" Official "" girlfriends for any kids in Kerala I think ( you know , parents know , go out , have...things... ) just secret. 

It might get boring if I drone on any more... So i stop here hoping you would post a reply.

39,"I’ve always wanted to experience hallucinating. I’ve made it to 3 days maybe two times before but I’ve stayed awake for 48 hours at least once a week since mid-2019. 

I’ve experienced three instances of auditory hallucinations in 2020. Two instances were induced by marijuana and the other by adderall. I also have experienced one case of mild visual hallucination. But it was in the dark and all I could see were tree branches. 

But tonight? I walked downstairs to get juice and flinched because I saw a shadow float past. I looked up in shock to find that the whole room had floating “aura”-like shadowy figures. Some of them started to resemble human figures so NATURALLY, I called a friend. I didn’t know if they were hallucinations or if they were “ghosts” but he shot that idea down &amp; told me I was crazy. He’s right. It was me. I’m a bit shook up at this point. But overall, not too bad. I just need to get to bed now.

This is when I saw my first undeniable figure. I’m back in my room now. Shadow figures still faintly about but at this point it’s like background clutter. I’m still on the phone as I sit atop my bed and look up to check on my blinds and that’s when I saw it. The blinds were pulled up to let in air, which was my own doing. But in the reflection, there were two faces staring back at me. Mine and one of my casual acquaintances who’d been spending more time with my group of friends. I spun around and nothing, but I can see the shadow outline of his bald head against my wall. I looked back and forth from the window to the wall (lol lil jon) until I was SURE I was in fact seeing what my eyes were TELLING me I was seeing. Oh, I was sure alright. So sure that I jumped up and whispering “omg omg omg”. 

Mind you, my friend is still on the phone. He said “you good?” I’m like HOLD ON. I’m not ready to tell someone I might be seeing some SHIT. But the reflection is still there. He’s smiling down at his hands and looking at his rings. What he was doing wasn’t creepy or especially haunting but I just couldn’t believe my own two eyes. 

Eventually I realized the circle on my tapestry must have made my brain visualize his head but I KNOW what I saw.

46,"I (mid-twenties, male) hope that this post will be somewhat understandable and coherent, because I do not care a lot for that right now. I just want to speak from my heart and we'll see what follows. Sit back and take your time because it will be long. Or if you prefer a light read, move on to the another post. I don't use words scarcely, unfortunately. Tl;dr at the bottom.

Out of fear that somebody will uncover my identity, I will use a throw-away account. 

I am fed up with life and have been for as long as i can remember. Throughout my life I felt incredibly dissatisfied with myself. I am born and raised in Western Europe in a middle-class family (I suppose we are a middle-class famliy). From that point of view I suppose there are a lot of things that I have that I want and things I don't want that I don't have. There is a lot to feel grateful for. The thing is, I never felt grateful, despite wanting to express that gratefulness, as I have been often told that being grateful yields happiness. Mostly, I have focused on that which I have which I do not want and the things I want, but do not have. I do *express* gratefulness, but I find it very difficult to *truly and sincerly experience* it.

Moving on, I've always had little confidence. It has grown since my childhood, but even now it is meager. I try to challenge myself and grow out of it. I often fail. Sometimes I succeed. But never I really manage to appreciate it. I always had friends. Not a lot, but I was not alone. Still, I have felt quite alone throughout my life. I often missed some connection with my peers. I still miss understanding.  That feeling has grown over time. Mostly I played videogames in my spare time as a child, which acted as a refuge from life I suppose. On the bright side, it built a strong foundation for me to learn English and helped me get to this level of ability, allowing me to spill out my life story to some strangers on the internet.

I never really knew what I wanted in life. It just felt like an empty canvas to fill in for yourself. Except that, to a certain degree, I've always felt like I have to fill it in a certain way. There are rules. There are obligations. Boundaries, judgements, laws and limitations. Combined with the fact that I have never found the things in live that drive me, fulfill me and stimulate me to flourish, life has always felt like survival to me. I feel like I don't *live* my life, but like I am *obliged to* *endure* *this everlasting struggle*, called my life.

Referring back to that I never knew what I wanted to do, explore or specifically achieve in life, choosing my path was rather challenging, although I suppose life and its choices challenge everybody. I always attempted to be a grade A student. Why exactly I am not sure. For sure not because I wanted to. I dreaded school, study and all of its obligations. Little to none of the subjects and assignments were able to motivate me, so it was quite dreadful. I just felt obligated. Like I had to, because if I did not I would not 'succeed' in life. Whatever that means. This would apply to not only all of my studies, but also to jobs and many aspects of daily life. I don't want to sound cocky but often I've been told that I'm not the runt of the litter when it comes to my intellegence. At the same time, it's probably that among many things that enabled this perfectionism as part of obsessive-compulsive behaviour. I will come back to that later.

Consequently, picking a follow-up study was very difficult. I was naïve in many ways. For sure in the way that I had no idea of what I wanted. At the moment I supposed I could grow into physics, biology and chemistry. So I picked a study involving diverse laboratory work. I didn't really like it and after a year I decided to go to university and study medical science.  I must admit, molecular biology intrigued me in a way, but as soon that I found out that I absolutely despised research and practically all jobs that would relate to it, I felt lost again. After my Bachelor degree I didn't know what to do. I made two attempts to study the corresponding Master program, but I could not do it. I despised it. I talked to people, visited open days, fairs and such, talked with career councillors but nothing really helped. I was left clueless.

Eventually I chose to study related to food. I must admit, I could have made worse choices despite not liking it overall. It was still a science program, but focused on the industry. Many alumni did not become scientists and actually did other stuff than just research. They actually worked in companies. Companies like Pfizer are also companies, of course, but by that I mean companies which do not mainly focus on research and such. I can't say that that is what I want, but I do know for sure that I want to stray away from research. During this study, I wanted to challenge myself. Well, I wasn't really convinced that I *wanted* it I suppose, but, again, for some reason I just *went along with the urge to do so*.

During my Bachelor's already I learned to despise many study and student associations. Their intentions and attitudes felt so superficial. Mostly the student associations. I know not all associations are the same, let alone the people that make up these associations, but my views are shaped by my personal experience. Please take that into account while you read my opinion on matters here. Surprisingly, I felt a strong urge to become part of the board of the study association of the food innovation program. Despite fearing the challenge I experienced a strong urge to contribute to the solidarity among students at that program. The program was unique in that students were also not treated like numbers by staff. On a rare occasion staff even joined drinks and parties. I made many friends for life in that program. Again, I feel that I *should* be grateful for that. But somehow I don't really *feel* grateful. Sometimes I actually think I do, but at the same time I just feel like my mind just wants to block it. I don't know how to explain it.

I never was a real athlete or into sports at all, but I suppose I eventually developed a fascination for some natural sceneries. At the same time, my leg just wouldn't recover from a previous injury. So that motivated me to work on that and start exercising and to get in shape for two week hiking trip in the Dolomites. A few months into jogging I overburdened my legs. It has been approximately 20 months since the injury and both my legs still hurt. Luckily not as bad as before. Still I feel enough bilateral pain in my upper legs, lower legs, achilles tendon, plantar fascia and to a lesser degree in other places as well. Enough pain to prevent me from doing much exercise or physical work. Unfortunately nobody knows what it exactly is and how I can heal. 10 months of physiotherapy with different approaches, podotherapy, alternative healing practices and multiple doctors do not know what to do with my legs and accompanied pains. They only agree on that I 'most likely' overburned my legs by jogging to far. **No shit Sherlock**. It has made me miss out on a lot of things. Both in a practical and recreational sense.

For this food study, I started an internship abroad. Again, for some reason my mind wanted to me to challenge myself. So I applied for internships a country that would appeal to me, is on the other side of the world and foreign to me and speaks a foreign language as well. Like my studies, I was not a fan of the (research) internship project. Again it was a matter of not knowing what the fuck I need to do with my life. Because I didn't know what to do with my life I figured I'd just go and explore that country and the world afterwards. Just do some shitty jobs now and then to come by and blow it all on international exploration. I trusted that in the end, my financial situation would be OK and that I would be able to buy a home or at least rent a place. At least I suppose that's a more sensible way of indulging than spending it all on sex, drugs and alcohol. Anyways, I would never see myself doing that anyways.

Unfortunately for me, the reason to explore that country was to *live it*. You don't go into nature and wander like a vagabond when you experience chronic pain in your damn legs. I only suffered this injury to my legs after started arranging this internship. Bummer. Still I went abroad because who knows what'll happen.

Guess what. Soon after I arrived with this pain in my legs, the pain only got worse. It got so bad that I wasn't even able to walk 200 meters without severe pain in my legs. Currently, the pain isn't that bad, but still worse enough to prevent me from doing anything reasonably physical. Although it is not constant, I experience it frequently wheter I move or not. I literally wake up with it and go to bed with it at the end of the day. It is one of the things in my head that drives me crazy.

After some getting used to being abroad and leaving the pain in my legs aside, I kind of like being there. Their culture was the opposite of my mindset: working to live, instead of living to work. In an attempt to replace the obsessive and compulsive nature of my mind I hoped to soak up some of this attitude. It did not work, unfortunately. Still, it was still challenging being there. Despite being in a  small city, there barely was anything going on and for the majority of time students were not in town because it was summer at that time. I felt lonely. And regardless of how much I wanted to hang out with my housemates, they kept more to themselves. And that's fine. Although I never really had peace with that because I craved social interaction and meeting up was difficult enough as it was in that city. Let a lone the bilateral leg injury. I liked them nevertheless and don't blame them for making their own choices because it is not up to me to oblige people to behave how I want to please me.

Finally, I met some people. Unfortunately, that was at the dawn of the rona (a.k.a. COVID-19) epidemic.  Out of fear that I would become not just stuck, but also broke abroad I decided to fly back home to my family. Another fear that motivated me was the risk of loved ones dying and me not being able to say good bye to them. So I spent a fortune on a hard-to-get plane ticket back home.  While airports closed down and the EU lobbied to keep certain airports (during a limited time) open for transit flights I experienced an emotional rollercoaster. Contemplating what to do and fearing the consequences of picking the most undeserible option. Luckily, the rollercoaster ended not where it had started but dropped me of back home. Back home I felt safe. This was somewhat ironic, considering the rona situation was dealth with very adequete in the country I left. Back home that was not really the case

Aside from the influence of rona on my graduation project (the internship abroad), I wasn't really bothered by it. Yet. After some struggles I was lucky enough to alter my project, finish it from home and graduate. Still, I felt miserable. My fucked up legs and the fucked up rona epidemic fucked my plans. I realize that it's not the end of the world. I am safe with my family, have a roof above my head and all my loved ones are still alive. Yet, I continue to feel like shit. I can *cognitively reflect* on the situation and acknowledge that it is not such a huge problem, but I simply *do not feel* like that. 

I graduated a few months ago and currently I have been applying for jobs for over five months without success. I know that the rona epidemic creates awfull circumstances to apply for jobs. Nevertheless, I still feel like my qualities are inadequate. More specifically, the requirements for the business-oriented side of jobs as discussed before seem to mismatch with my qualities. Every time I would apply for a job that seems acceptable to me, I get dismissed sooner or later. Recruiters have replied with a plethora of reasons. Reasons that stand out mostly relate to me not having any prior job experience, having an irrelevant working level (as they often require a more applied, theoretically lower level of thinking instead of a scientist's mindset, although my last program was rather applied), not matching as a person or they fail to see that I *want* this. They do not see my *motivation*. Nevertheless, I do understand them. It is more for them than it is for me to decide how fit I am to do a certain job. If I am not as enthousiastic as someone else, I get it. But how am I supposed to show that I *want* that job? In my life I have never sensed a goal in life, something that I really want, something that I want to do because it makes me feel better, not because I feel obliged to do. Something *compulsive*. I do not perceive a higher goal of saving humany, making earth greener or just developing the best products for a certain consumer segment. In the end it's all just about fucking money. That's all there is to it, for me at least. I have financial needs. I have bills to pay. I don't know about others, but I can't and don't want to suck on someone else's tit for a life time. Whether that is the government or my parents. I need a job to sustain myself and I will do it well for the sake of job security.

As mentioned a few times already, I felt lonely. Never had I been in a romantic relationship with anybody. I wasn't that much of a casanova either, although I must admit that some one-night stands and such. I craved the loving hand of a woman in my life. Judging by what I've been told, I'm not ugly. Less often people would actually say I'm rather good looking, although I've always find it difficult to accept and acknowledge such compliments as actual qualities of mine. Nevertheless, since a few months I have found my first romantic partner and at first I was so happy. I was so, incredibly happy and constantly floating on a pink cloud. But I was naïve to romance in a relationship and after the honeymoon phase I didn't know how to deal with it. I don't know how to deal with differences in needs and differences in the way we communicate. Again I craved control. Does it need to feel perfect, let alone good at a given moment? When should I be taken more seriously? When should I take my partner more seriously?  When do I stand my ground and when do I give in? Is it just (with all respect towards women) women in general that my needs and ways of communication mismatch sometimes? Do I love her? Did I just fall in love with potential? What is love? When should I accept what I have? At first I obsessed about not having a partner and the need for a loving female hand. Now I have replaced that obsession with an obsession about the quality of our relationship. I hate my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

So far some main elements that shape the timeline of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

You have probably noticed that I mentioned words like or relating to 'obsession', 'control' and 'compulsivity' frequently. For those that might have guessed already, I have been diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and obsessive compulsive personality disorder (OCPD), as well as chronic depression. And no, for those that do not know, it is not the same as autism. They diagnosed me about 5 years ago. Such a diagnosis also makes sense in hindsight. Since my childhood I've not felt well, safe to say like shit. When I couldn't control things, things about which I, apparently, was obsessive about I felt even worse. Why this was and still is the case I do not know. Experts do not know. They probably think that it has to do with the overprotective way I was raised, as well as some familial predisposition for mental disease. Apparently strong compulsivity in behaviour was not uncommon in my family. I do not want to claim that I am my diagnosis, but it does say something about my personality. For me it does mean that I do experience some difficulties in specific situations or daily life. It does not say that there is no other way for me to deal with them than I do currently, but it can be extremely difficult for me to cope with the anxiety that I feel.

Rewinding back to my childhood. Recall that I said I liked to play videogames. This may sound ridiculous, and I agree. Still, I can't help that I felt the way I felt in that situation. Speaking of first-world problems. Long story short, there was a moment that I (apparently) was devastated when I lost some save progress to some games. I am not talking about a single moment or a week of sadness for my lost efforts. No I am talking about developing fears for playing a game console and feeling incredibly anxious when I walked by it. Let a lone when someone played the console. At one point my parents said 'enough is enough' and let my brother and his friends play the console. I was terrified. I felt like I was being tortured. I've probably never felt that anxious up until that point in my life and kept crying and yelling that I wanted to die to my parents. Following this situation I received therapy. As a child I couldn't comprehend what was really going on yet. I never realised that it was due to compulsive behaviour and part of a behavioural pattern that needed to change. Suprisingly, I never felt like my parents really remembered the outcome of the therapy or recalled that there was a need for something to be done. At least, I cannot remember it and my mom did not until I spoke to her about this a few weeks ago. I have never understood this. Don't get me wrong, I love my parents. But if your child experiences this stuff something must be changed. Then again, maybe they did remember and did act accordingly. Maybe it is just that I failed to recall that they did. Just like I barely recall any of that therapy, what it was for and what the outcome was until I read the files again. I don't know.

This behaviour also partially explains my obsession with my perfomance in education and perfectionism in general. Although in a different, perhaps more moderate way, it still manifests itself today. Even during my Bachelor when my father died of cancer. He only died five weeks after diagnosis to a rare form of cancer. He was the totem pole of our family and kept us together. I have always loved him and admired his ingenuity and ambition. I feel like he was the opposite of what I was in that sense. To this day I still think: ""Why not me? He still had so much plans and ambitions. He enjoyed life. For as long as I recalled I felt miserable and would be more than happy to end mine if that would spare his."" Unfortunately that is not how cancer works. How life, or the universe works for that matter. I am getting a little sidetracked here. What I want to say is, that even when he was suffering during his trials, I was so obsessed with my studies. I feared that I would spent to much time being with him and not perform well enough at the university. I did visit him, but not as long or as often as I could and should have done. Speaking about priorities... fucking hell. I am such a selfish fuck. A fucking asshole who couldn't put some extra time aside to spend with his his struggling (in hindsight dying) father. We did not know that he would die, but beyond a certain point doctors proclaimed that recovery would be highly unlikely. Eventually, he died. His last breath leaving his lungs was the most terrible thing I have ever experienced. I would not have wanted to miss that moment of course, but it is the most dreadful moment of my life. I miss him, and I always wil. But my obsessive-compulsive behaviour did not stop there. You do not only lose a loved one, but you also have to arrange a lot of stuff. Not only a funeral, but administration and other things that have to be dealth with. It was only a few days after his cremation and I was back at university. Driven by my obsessions, leaving most of the tasks with my brother who was still studying at the time as well. To put it shortly, my experienced mental difficulties as well. Although it was and always has been hard for them to understand my behaviour, especially at that time, my brother and my mom have forgiven me. One of the few things I can truthfully say that I *feel* grateful for. I still cannot say I have forgiven myself, though. It was only after my father's death that I had received my diagnosis, so it was hard for me, let alone for people around me to understand my behaviour. I say this not to justify, but to explain my behaviour. 

The thing that finally lead to my diagnosis was another obsessive-compulsive behavioural pattern rising up. Somehow I developed a fear of contamination. I was not afraid to become ill, but just horrified by the experience making physical contact with some stuff/substances. Mainly of biological origin, such as most biological excretions (e.g. saliva, urine). Of all the dysfunctional behaviour I have shown up to the present, this was the most extreme. It isolated me from my studies, work, associations and my social life. I got up in the morning and started my washing ritual until somewhere in the afternoon, sometimes as late as 4 pm. After that I would just fall asleep on my 'safe and clean' spot on the couch while still somehow making sure that I would not come into contact with anything that I would not want to touch. I would postpone visits to the bathroom for as long as I could because going to the bathroom meant another long washing ritual for me.  I drank less, I ate less. All to reduce visits to the bathroom. I would scream at the dog for sitting on my shoe, fearing that traces of fecal matter would 'contaminate' it. In the shower I scrubbed my nails until they bled and beyond. They *must* be clean and there is no other way. I did anything to prevent to get into touch with anything that I considered dirty. These examples give you a picture of the situation. I felt like a slave of my own thoughts, defending my compulsivity with 'reason'.

I've had intensive therapy and medication. Medication not only to treat me, but to calm me down and *allow* treatment. I've spent time in psychiatric hospitals or whatever you want to call them. Before that, before space for this treatment was not available yet, I've been put into a ward for people that pose a danger to themselves. I was put there because my family couldn't put up with me at home, understandibly. I left again after a few days because, even though it was a hospital ward, it was very dirty. Even for my standards today, and I have made a lot of progression in that field. It has taken a few years of treatment, but now I wouldn't be bothered as much as I would before. It is not gone, but for sure better than it was. The thing is, there is always danger lurking in the dark when it comes to obsessive-compulsive behaviour. That is what I have been told by therapists and what I have experienced so far. I still am a slave of my own thoughts, but have learned to rebel against the regime. Even if it is only a bit.

In whatever form or shape I suffer from this disfunction behavioural pattern, I feel like I will never get rid of it. If I am not obsessing about one thing, than something else will take its place. Is it not what people think of me in one way, than I will obsess about the enduring pain in my legs, about not finding a job that I don't even like, about not knowing what I want, about studying, about anything else. Always will there be something to fill its place. Always will it feel like a war going on inside my head, like an enduring storm that deprives me of my sleep. I am not saying that doing things, whether it is anything in general to keep my mind occupied, meditation, shitty trivial and superficial self-help books and blogs or receiving therapy, regular or alternative, does not help. Some things have helped, some more than another. Some things with chronic effects some things only in a short-term fashion. But it simply is not a solution. Just like I initially mostly coped with my fears by acting compulsively in an attempt to neutralise that fear, these therapies and such feel very similar. They all feel like coping mechanisms. Coping mechanisms to provent the need for other coping mechanisms. But the psychological cancer and its predisposition to grow and spread to more aspects of life is still in my mind. And I not only fear that I will never lose or adequately learn to deal with this predisposition, I truly believe it. Judging by what specialists and more experienced I have little reason to believe it will leave my head.

I don't want this endless fight in my head. I want to be at peace, not inflate everyday problems like they are catastrophic. I want to be able to adequately deal with or perhaps not even care about such problems like most people. But I do not see such an outcome within my reach. There is a lot to live for, but from my perspective it is simply not worth it. People argue towards me that it is, but for me nobody can argue against it. Not against such a subjective matter. I have contemplated suicide over, and over and over again. If I relieve myself as an experiencing entitiy of the capability to experience suffering I will never have to worry or suffer again. I will also lose many things to enjoy in life, but I do not see that as a problem. Debilitating my capacity to experience anything also makes it impossible for me to miss anything that I would otherwise enjoy. Of course people around me would suffer. I don't even want to think about how my mother would suffer most out of all my loved ones. But again, if I die, I cannot suffer from her sadness. Regardless of how selfish it may sound, that is what I believe is true. I do not believe in the spirit or afterlife. I see our consciousness simply as a result of the functioning of our nervous system. Nobody exactly knows how it is created or whether or not a soul or whatever might be involved, but I think we are no more, no less than mere flesh and blood. If I die, it just ends. I don't think I will see an afterlife in whatever shape or form. My body will be dissoluted into its building blocks by nature. Into molecules, atoms. Just mass and energy serving as recyclable building blocks for the wooden table I am sitting at or anything else for that matter. Just like we people turn food into shit, shit becomes plants, plants are harvested and prepared into food, and again we eat it.

Again, I get a little bit sidetracked. I think it is obvious that my perspective of life is rather nihilistic. I don't really see a goal or purpose in life. No more or less than what you want to make of it. I have never felt like making it into anything. From my perspective, people essentially don't have to do anything in life. The only thing we have to do in the end is die. With the current status of science and its ability it is the of the only pivotal things in a lifetime that is virtually inevitable if you ask me. Ironically, I have always felt obligated to do many of the things that I have done in life. For the far majority of my lifetime I have just wanted to end it. I have never made real attempts. Hesitantly I have pushed a blade on my wrists, headed towards the train tracks, researched ways to end my own life with medication, seeking access to a gun, orienting myself in the process of suicide clinics or explored other ways to do it. Regardless of how close or how far I have been driven to the point of relieving myself of my own misery, I never succeeded to do so. Somehow my urge to live or a fear of failed attempts and ensuing extreme discomfort always prevailed over my wish for self-inflicted salvation. Another struggle to add. Another something to add to my self-pity list. I hate myself. I regret the day that I was born. I will never have children because I don't want to risk seeing anything related to my toxic compulsivity in them. I despise my incapability to just deal with life like most people. I see so many things that i reflect upon and think that I should be grateful for, but I simply do not feel it. There are so many people that experience things that are so much worse, that do not have luxuries and priviliges that I feel. I feel ashamed of myself. I never have loved myself and I do not see that happening, ever. People have the best intentions when they say that things will get better. But I simply can't hear it anymore. I can't listen to the same old things people tell me to do to make myself feel better. It has never worked so far. What reason do I ultimately have to keep investing in myself? People never really have understood me, and I do not expect that someone fully will eventually. People will miss me once I am gone, I am sure. Whether it would be only 1 person or many. They will always drag such a loss with them, but they will get over it. Just like I got over the loss of my father.

I do not want to live, not like this, but I do not want to die either. I want to get rid of this cancer in my mind. But I see no end at the end of the tunnel. Let me just die somewhere in the dark of this tunnel.

Whether people advise for or against my suicide for whatever reason, please don't tell me to call a suicide hotline or whatever. Even if i would feel like doing so I probably would not. During some of the previous crisises I talked to someone else, but nobody can offer me what I seek. It is pointless to me. I am not here to say that I will kill myself and that this will be my final message. Even if I would say so, I probably would not kill myself. Just like I have never been able to do so, regardless of how determined or close I was. to actually doing it. Somehow my urge to live has always prevailed over my reasoning in favour of suicide. You don't have to worry about me hurting myself physically.

Nobody here needs to agree or disagree with me, but do as you please. For me this is not about being right or wrong about how I view life. Although I would appreciate people hearing me out, I am not here to go into an in-depth discussion. I mostly spent my afternoon writing this to vent. I sense a lack of connection and understanding. I feel the need to be heard without causing to much drama among my loved ones in my social circle. I probably won't follow this post continuously, but try to respond later.

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr: I have felt bitter and like shit throughout my life, whether I have justified reasons to do so or not. I am fed up with myself and have tried to change, but without adequate results. I am tired of trying. I am weak, bitter and filled with self-pity. No I will not kill myself, because I can't. I will not call a suicide hotline. I am mostly here to vent and feel the need to be heard.**",04Dec2020,1

50,"My brain is just too fucked up for me to ever be happy in life. Severe depression which is also extremely treatment resistant (more like completely non-responsive). Since I was 6 years old, I've been to over a dozen therapists, psychiatrists, social workers, and other people for support. I've been on more medications and combinations of medication than I can count, made a ton of dietary changes, routine changes, mindfulness courses, and other alternative treatments. None of it has made even the slightest bit of difference and it seems like my brain is just not wired to be happy. Currently I'm going to two different therapists. I see one every week and the other every two weeks. They can help, briefly, while I'm in their office or on the phone with them, but I always plunge right back into extreme depression after I leave.

I basically have no friends left, I can't work because my area's basically in full lockdown, a lot of the stuff I like to do is off limits, the stuff that I can do from home doesn't bring me any joy anymore, I live with really unsupportive and cold parents, I probably won't be able to move out and get my own place for at least 10 years if ever at all, I fucked things up with an amazing woman who wanted to date me about 3 years ago and still can't get over it, I can't drive because of a visual disability, I feel like a prisoner in my own house, I'm so crushingly lonely it's hard to get out of bed, and a lot of nights I go to bed just hoping I don't wake up in the morning.

I'm NOT suicidal, not because I have even the faintest shred of desire to live but just because I'm too much of a pussy. I feel like maybe starting heroin or something. Hopefully I'll accidentally overdose and die.",04Dec2020,1
51,"Hello everyone!

I started my sophomore year of college a few months ago. At first, everything was going great, I was paying attention and enjoying my classes, without any major problems (except for some concentration problems).

However, this past month has been really overwhelming for me. I'm not doing very well mentally AND physically (my dominant hand has been in a lot of pain due to writing a lot of notes and being on my computer for long periods of time) and...I have fallen behind. I have skipped a lot of classes because I genuinely struggle with sleep (I don't sleep a lot and I don't even sleep very well), resulting in me not even having the strength to open my eyes when I wake up. 

The most difficult class for me this semester has been psychology. It is interesting, it is new, but it is difficult. At first, everything was going okay, but after this past month, I can't grasp a single concept, I am behind on notes and I even struggle with paying attention to class.

I think I can handle my other classes because they're more assignment based (I do better with assignments than actual studying) but I cannot handle psychology. 

I want to email my professor to ask for advice on how I can somehow catch up with all of the material that I have missed, but I don't know how I should approach her. She's a lovely person, always makes sure to ask us how we are and discuss life with us before our class, but I am so shy, and I don't even know what to say.

Any advice on how to approach her?",04Dec2020,1
52,"My brothers and I were adopted together from Russia in 2001 and we were always clumped together since then- seen as the siblings in school and whatnot. And seen as a trio almost

That’s chill and all but we are now in our early 20’s and we are our own people. With my two brothers I feel like it would make more sense for them to be seen together more since they are twins and actually related to eachother, but again they are their own people and have their own lives.

Why can’t my mom get that IM my own person too?? 

Why am I seen as disabled too? Yes I may have some issues due to adoption and abuse but Jesus Christ I’m not disabled. Why does she see me this way? I know I’ve been making progress! I’m able to keep a job rn, sure money situation is kind of eh but I’m able to be independent for the most part- but like many 22 year olds - assistance and pushes in the right direction is all I need and guidance. And that’s for like anyone- that doesn’t mean I’m fucking disabled. 

Regardless- even if I were disabled I would be able to be independent and there is nothing wrong with being disabled or having a disability- I mean my brothers have epilepsy and Aspergers and they honestly are doing great on their own- but the issue I have with being associated with being disabled is I’m not actually disabled. 

First it was about my eyesight, got that checked and with corrected glasses I can even drive- which was a surprise because I was told all my life I’m legally blind so.

So nope not there. So what would make my mom think I’m disabled? 

Granted tho- due to abuse I have had outbursts of rage and issues however I’m trying to get that under control and I do not open to my mom about this that much because why would I? I don’t trust her with that info

57,"I like survival stuff but i'm actively suicidal. Nothing makes sense about me. I just keep on knowledge dumping my fatigued mind with survival techniques and binge-watch survival documentaries. Although i just cleared some of my stuff because i was certain i'm about to do it an hour ago but then i got distracted with the survival handbook i found on my desk. Now I wish i have the money to go camping and experience the adrenaline putting myself in a situation that could potentially kill me. Or being able to buy decent survival gears, climb mountains, see stunning nature views or do outdoorsy stuff. I wish i'm older and i'm not socially anxious, dirt poor who is stuck in a dangerous, ugly, uninteresting country with emotionally neglectful parents who are too damaged themselves to give a fuck about me.

60,"Pretty much I too my bio lab final online like all of my tests (through canvas) so far. However, this was my first test online that I had to have zoom open so I fit both zoom and my test page on my monitor. Canvas the service that the school was using to take the test monitors if I leave the tab, and I would occasionally leave the tab to check my zoom to make sure my camera is still one  (my laptop is broken so my camera would just randomly turn off and I have to click on it to turn on IDK why) and I'm worried that my professor is going to think I left the tab to go google the answer on the internet.

62,"I was dysphoric ever since I was 13. I never knew who I am or who I even want to be. I tried different labels but I still couldn't decide, I didn't know what felt right. I've been thinking about this a lot lately, since my dysphoria skyrocketed recently, and I think I might be non-binary. A few days ago I almost cried when I had to choose my gender in an app. I was dreaming that I had a beard. I flinch whenever someone calls me a woman and I immediately become sad. I was daydreaming about being intersex and at that moment I felt so relieved because that would mean that my feelings are somehow justified, that I have a reason to feel non-binary and I'm not just trying to feel special. But that's ridiculous because I don't have to be intersex to be non-binary, I don't have to justify my feelings and my dysphoria. This kind of opened my eyes. If I felt so relieved at the idea of being non-binary then why am I so reluctant to admit it? I'm still very confused, I still haven't figured myself out, but I'm now feeling much more comfortable with the idea of being non-binary.

64,"Just to clarify, I'm not actively suicidal right this instant so there is no need to worry about that. I'm just here to vent, it's Friday and work is slow so here we go.

My therapist has a funny term for my mentality, she calls it ""chronic suicidality."" I looked into it and apparently it's quite common among folks with Borderline Personality Disorder. Well, we went through the DSM-5 lately, and I don't think I fall into that category. If anything, I fall closer into the Antisocial category, but since I stopped drinking, I've stopped a lot of bad habits, and I have better impulse control.

Anyway, along with my chronic suicidality comes the never-ending thought of ""what would happen to the people in my life if I were to die right now?""

I know my family would never be the same. Parents left to bury their child, little brother left alone. But I guess that would depend on how I'd die. If it were suicide: despair, career abandonment, and it might drive each of them away from each other, harboring resentment for each other.

Were it a heart attack, or an accident: I don't know. Definitely sadness. But maybe hope. Maybe it would bring them together.

I wonder what my friends would think. ""Damn dude, for what?"" or maybe ""That piece of shit actually did it, what a scumbag.""

They'd be right to say the latter if I were to have done it. Because destroying my family isn't worth skipping to the end. That's really the only reason I haven't done it. And what's crazy is that things are going pretty good. I'm sober, I got off cigarettes, I'm finally getting dick pills for my fucking limp dick, and I'm buying a fucking house.

I have it good. Really good. I have a loving family and friends. I can keep my depression under control as long as I stay medicated. It's all about will power. Today's been a pretty good day, actually. Hadn't thought about killing myself all day until maybe half an hour before writing this. Guess I'm just not keeping myself busy enough. I'm visiting my folks after work today. I'm glad they're still here and I still have them. I'm gonna miss the shit out of them when they're gone. I need to stop writing now before I spiral further. Gonna go piss and get back to some busy-work,

Thanks for reading, have a great weekend.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I've been passively suicidal for a long time, which often leads me to wonder what would become as a result of my death, but it does keep me from actually killing myself. I have a good life and I'm doing better medicated than not. Most importantly, I know that this is all about willpower. It's up to me to feel better.",04Dec2020,1

67,"I have long known the Buddhist principle that *attachment* leads to suffering and its opposite *detachment* brings escape from suffering. Not escape from pain, or from discomfort, or any such sensual experience ... escape from suffering. Pain is something that happens to you. Suffering is a way to respond to it.

But today I read this alternate expression by the Buddha of the same thing, when I was linked [here](https://suttacentral.net/mn1/en/sujato#mn1:172-194.26): ""relishing is the root of suffering."" If you *relish* something, or you anticipate relishing something, it will lead to suffering. No exceptions.

This points out the harshness of the world. We are built to crave. We are built to relish. We are built to attach ourselves to things. And all these things we are built to do will **inevitably** lead to suffering.

Powerful stuff.",04Dec2020,1
68,"Bruh. This 1882 book was just in a drawer with some plastic canvas stuff, random pages torn out of magazines, odds and ends. (I think it's a Bible, but doesn't seem like a traditional one). There's a name inside that I don't recognize, it was presented to her December 25th, 1883. Maybe it's just because I'm a nerd for anything antique/vintage/historic but this is just insane to me. 138 years old. Just to think of the things that have happened while this book has been in existence.

I looked at our family tree thing online and couldn't find her though. So I have no idea who the person was, maybe a family friend. Still so cool.",04Dec2020,10
70,"in the past few months i’ve been happier than i’ve been in a while. after a really hard breakup, i was finally getting back on my feet. i made a lot of new friends, rekindled relationships with old ones, and even started seeing someone new. 

then the guy i was seeing slept with my best friend and i walked in on it. i’ve already posted a more in depth story about that. 

i’ve been thinking about this so much for so long and i’ve tried being normal with them but i don’t think i can anymore. we are all a part of the same friend group, so i know if i drop them both i’ll likely have to drop everyone. i’ve gone through this before when i let go of a very toxic person which also meant letting go of that friend group. i had seemingly no one for a long time and it was really hard. 

i’m scared to go through that again. needless to say i’ve been aching over this for a while and have been very depressed lately. i don’t know what to do. i don’t know if i can forgive them or if i’m better off being sad for a while.",04Dec2020,1

The preppy private school I went to was filled with rich kids who’s first cars were Mustangs and BMWs and all sorts of amazing cars and I was shamed and mocked for my crappy beat up Toyota. 

Today I got to go and pick up my dream car and it feels amazing! Everyone’s been telling me it’s a bad idea to buy a brand new car and admittedly buying a sports car in the middle of a pandemic is risky but it makes me feel proud.

72,"I've recently been getting out of an abusive relationship and somewhere along the lines I have managed to make a huge bunch of friends online who have taught me that I am worthy, how I deserve to be treating, what it means when someone actually cares about you and how to just talk endlessly about random stuff all night. Ive been so happy that ive been crying happy tears multiple times a day for the past several days, and im the happiest and most confident i think i have ever been, everyone is so nice to each other and its such a positive group of people. I can finally be myself after being stuck in that situation from age 16-19  
My only issue currently however, is that I am now too happy to sleep? Ive slept 7 hours in 2 days and spent over 24 hours almost non stop on call with people popping in and out throught that time. My closest two friends of the group and I made a pact to all go to sleep early tonight and sort out our sleeping patterns and stuff and they have kept their side of the pact as far as i am aware but currently I am somehow too high on life to sleep. I have tried listening to sad music to bring me down but all it did was make me cry happy tears at the fact i didnt relate to it anymore. I dont really know what else to do to get to sleep.

2. When I met her I just felt she seemed like a hippie, dressed like one, etc. So I said that.

77,"Nobody will probably find and read this post anyway so here I go. 

I have been mentally struggling this past year. I felt like I could not do things the right way. Yes, I may have been one of the lucky ones who is surrounded by very supportive friends but it made me feel even more pressured to do things the right way as seeing that my friends are getting their shit together. But, looking back, I've learned that struggling is actually a form of a lesson. I am human anyway. I fuck up. I can feel emotions. And it is okay to cry. It is human to not feel okay. 

My emotions were all over the place. There was a mix of happiness, sadness, anxiousness, excitement, fear and hopelessness in my mind. The pandemic and being locked down in one small room alone DID NOT HELP AT ALL. However, someone who I am now close with and is part of my small circle of close friends that I consider family, helped me through it. I pushed him away a few times but he never really left. What have I done or deserve to even have a friend like him? 

Now, as I'm still waking up, at 6:25 in the morning, I am choosing to become better. This is my day one. Becoming better mentally, emotionally and hopefully physically too (I am too lazy to workout so it's a workout to get myself to workout LOL). Improving myself and working on my toxic traits are two of my very many priorities in life right now. I want to become a better person FOR ME. To think positively and dig myself out of the hole I created because of my depression and anxiety. To approach my own life and make my own decisions in a different and better perspective. To making BETTER choices. To love myself again.

Because at the end of the day, you got your own back. I am going to love myself more and I cannot wait until I see and feel the change that I will make out of self love.",04Dec2020,6
