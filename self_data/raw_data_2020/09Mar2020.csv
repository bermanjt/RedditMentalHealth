The head of the kidshome always tells me how one day i will become the head of a Kidshome, alot of my familymembers do that too. Eventhough its realy encouraging, it also puts alot of stress onto my shoulders, i mean i didnt even finish my education yet and alrdy so many people expect from me to be a boss someday. I mean that is a goal of mine, but its different when i stick this goal for myself than other people expecting me to get there. Not sure how to Deal with it. I feel like i should just do my thing and not listen to these people, also i think they dont know under how much pressure they put me.
Might not sound like a big deal to alot of people, but just had to get that out somewhere.",09Mar2020,1

(seemed very arrogant with her reply and loud too) (could have been an ewwww) she said it acting all ‘la Di da’ ( snobbish) 

She stinks really bad too so the audacity from her to act like that especially that ppl in there rio her behind her back for it yet she stands there very up herself.


 Her bf is in prison whilst she’s in community service for the same crime idk what it is and he does call Her often in the shop but she also checks out other dudes sometimes and fancied another guy in the shop (who called her all sorts to me because of her hygiene) but has poor hygiene BO and looks like a hard drug user. ’m A guy.",09Mar2020,1

I just smiled with it. She said it nicely judging by a laugh at the end but idk. i wasn't near clean shaven at the time of the appointment tbh) but always was previous appointments. she sent me an email the next day about it saying about what I need to take with me to the interview and at the bottom it had underlined ‘please dress smartly’ and ‘good luck’

10,"I’ve been at uni a year now and I have began to feel so alone, all my friends are hours away and I don’t see them often. The friends I’ve made here at uni are nice and I like them but they’re not the same, despite being surrounded by people all the time like course mates and flat mates I still feel so alone. I want to have someone here with me to talk to about our problems. I want a hug. 

When my course mates ask me to go out, I say no (I have been out with them before tho), I feel bad because I feel like they think I don’t like them, the reason I don’t go out is because I don’t like drinking or clubbing. So whilst they’re out doing something I don’t enjoy, I’m in my room alone left to myself. It’s so hard to speak to anyone about this because I am quite talkative and love to make people happy, and the way I act is totally different to how I’m feeling.

I have never put anything I've created out before, I've been too afraid. My family doesn't support what I do in any regard and I struggle deeply with my mental health, especially anxiety.

My name is Sara and this is my passion: I do off the top freestyles- meaning that I listen to music I've never heard before and make up lyrics and a melody on the spot. This is an off the top I did to Chance The Rapper's song We Go High, pitched a key higher. I listened to it twice and made half of the verses and then listened a third time and freestyled as I recorded. I view this as an homage to Chance and I would really appreciate it if you listened. If not, I hope you are very kind to yourself and others today. :)

19,"So I graduated high school back in 2016. I moved to Queensland at the start of 2012 from New South Wales. Anyway, when I started school, I quickly made some friends and whatnot. 

Fast forward to about 2014, “sack whacking” was a thing, and for the life of me I hated being sack whacked, it hurt and more times than not it’d make me physically sick. So, lets call the autistic kid Ryan. I didn’t know that Ryan was on the spectrum because I had never spoke to him before. Ryan came up to me and hit me pretty hard in the nuts with a the back of his hand, I was pretty rightfully pissed off about it I reckon, so I’ve started to throw a few punches at Ryan. It probably wasn’t the best way I could have reacted, but it’s done now. From this, I got a two week suspension, while he got nothing (my parents were pretty upset about this one).

Ever since this incident, Ryan has made up stories about me bullying him, one in particular is a story about me “bashing” him before I even lived in this state, another one is a story about me “rolling” him at night time. I almost got in a bit of strife for this. 

At the end of high school I knew that I was on Ryans Hitlist, but never thought much of it, but one of my close friends has now got a job working in a pizza shop with Ryan and I’ve found out that Ryan still carries on about me and actually carries his Hitlist in his wallet, I’m number 3 on it. 

TLDR; Had a fight with someone about 6 years ago and I’m still on his “hitlist”.",09Mar2020,1

23,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/

28,"*Tried to post in r/letsnotmeet but they wouldn’t approve it or tell me why, so putting here.*


I’m a woman and bought myself a sex doll for Valentine’s Day. It’s actually stunningly realistic, especially considering what I paid for it. 

One night I enjoyed a rendezvous with my sex doll and fell asleep with him still in bed next to me. I figured I’d get him put away in the morning, no big deal. 

Fast forward to about 3:00am, I’m asleep and wake up to the sound of glass breaking. I’m petrified, but before I can make a move to get my phone charging across the room, I hear heavy footsteps approaching the door, so just freeze pretending to be asleep. 

It was mostly a fear response but there was also a voice in the back of my head saying if I didn’t alert the intruder to my presence or engage with him hopefully he’d just take the TV or go through the medicine cabinet or whatever he came looking for and dip out. 

But then I heard heavy footsteps bypass my living room with a nice, big, easy to detach from the wall, flat screen TV. Then right past my bathroom, where one would naturally check for prescription drugs if that’s what they were after. Then right by my study with my laptop charging in plain sight and my desktop as well. 

The guy comes bursting through my door, I hear it smash open, and I freeze, hoping if I pretend to be asleep he’ll carry out the safe out of my closet, or realize the most valuable stuff is in the other rooms, and leave. This had all happened in the space of two minutes so I hadn’t had time to form any coherent plan. 

I hear him getting closer and I’m thinking “you have to fight back before he gets too close.” But then thinking “What if he has a weapon?” And “What if you’re mishearing?” 

As he got within five feet of my bed, I hear him stop and go running out of the house. 

I call the police as soon as I’m sure he’s gone, and I’m still in shock. I realize they’ll be coming over and want to go through my bedroom as a crime scene so quickly get some clothes on and put my sex doll in the closet. 

The police come and take my statements and within a few days were able to track the guy down. It wasn’t anyone I knew or had affiliation with (it would later turn out we had two degrees of separation, but I didn’t realize it at the time, and it didn’t turn out to be very relevant.) 

They questioned him and he told them he’d come to rob me. When asked why me he said he’d been casing housing in the neighborhood for the last couple days and mine seemed easiest because it was a single story with a sliding glass door and a woman who lived alone. 

But since nothing was taken, he went straight to my bedroom, and he hadn’t parked anywhere near my place (like you’d need to if you were trying to load up a TV, stereo, and get away with other heavy stolen goods), the police were doubting this story and kept asking me to think through all my interactions with him and if there’s anything I’m leaving out because the story doesn’t make sense. 

Obviously they considered for a second that he was there to kidnap me or enact some sort of violence, but I put up no fight and was still pretended to be asleep when he bolted from the house. The police, and I, were all confused. 

The police question him again and then call me angrily asking me to come in and go over my statement. I do. I say it’s all accurate. They look at each other in disbelief and ask if I’m sure there aren’t any details I’m leaving out, that they’re on my side, that they won’t be mad if I just tell them anything I might be leaving out. I assure them it’s everything I remember. 

Finally, they lay it all down, that when directly confronted with “why didn’t you steal anything if you were there to rob the place” the assailant told them “I was going for the jewelry drawer and to check for designer clothes because they’re the most valuable and easiest to walk out with and get rid of, but when I got in her room her boyfriend was sleeping over, so I left. I didn’t want to risk waking him up, I wasn’t looking for a confrontation.”

The cops ask why I didn’t tell them my boyfriend was over and why he didn’t stay after the incident and that he needed to come in immediately to give a statement. I had no idea what the guy was talking about at first and started to say “he’s lying, I’ve been single since—“ then I realized. 

I sheepishly explained, and the cops and I had a good laugh over it. But I think my sex doll might’ve saved my life, or at the very least, saved me a horrific trauma, that night. I’ve officially gotten my money’s worth.

40,"I broke up with my ex this past November. He always had a very low sex drive, and never really shared the same enthusiasm I had for most things in that area. I always felt like I was begging to be wanted. He’d make jokes about me being a freak, and I really did feel like a monster sometimes. I cared about him and loved him, but I remember having such an intense desire for him, even in the most innocuous situations, and I felt like I was a pervert when he never felt the same about me. I often wondered how long it would take for him to ask for sex if I just stopped initiating.

At one point he started gaining some weight, which is when I realized that heavier guys were the sexiest thing ever to me. He was insecure about his body, but I thought he was just the most handsome thing I’d ever seen. I loved to just look at him naked, not even do anything, just look at him and admire how sexy he was. I figured my intense attraction to him would help his self esteem. I fucking adored his tummy. But I wonder now if that was just an excuse I told myself. I’d ask for pictures of him, of his body, and the heavier he looked the more I loved it. If I told him he looked good a certain day, he’d ask if it was because he looked fat, or if he actually looked good. He associated my enthusiasm with his own feelings of ugliness. I should never have acted the way I did. I was so obsessed. I feel sick.

I still see him and talk to him. We always had friendly banter, but now most things I say give meaner and meaner responses. I told him that I’d appreciate him going a little lighter on the banter, as it just felt more and more real instead of funny. We went for a car ride and he told me that he didn’t know why, but my presence just irritated him these days. That he cared about me, but he just had this feeling of annoyance whenever I was near. He said how he knew that I always wanted him and his body, but it was always the parts he least liked about himself. He’d felt objectified. I didn’t know what to say, but I deeply apologized. He was right, I probably did go too far.

I feel awful. I genuinely believed he was the most wonderful, handsome man and the whole time I was hurting him. I really was perverted. Always begging for shit, always drooling at the mouth. I’d look at him and just want to fuck him, nearly every single moment. He’d just be going about his day and I’d find some way to get horny from it. I was always wanting. Even now, I look at him and there’s still some of that desire there. He probably feels that every time I stare at him I’m thinking about him in that way. That’s probably why he feels so irritated in my presence, it’s like all the “I love you’s” have gone and all that’s left is my awful gaze, and everything it entails. I feel awful. I never meant to hurt anyone, but I did. I don’t know why I keep hurting people. I’m an awful pervert. I sexualize the people around me. I’d grasp at every chance I got to touch his body. Why am I like this? Why do I want this so bad? Even shame doesn’t stop me from feeling this way. I don’t know what to do. I’m already losing so many people I care about. I don’t want to lose him too. I care about him so much. Why is it always the ones I care about the most that I end up hurting?

It all just stings. I mentioned to him the other day that climbing into bed at night is what I look forward to the most these days, and that I dread waking up in the morning. I said I needed a long, long nap. He said that just sounded like dying.",09Mar2020,1
43,"Hey y'all. So a few days ago I finished watching Avatar: The Last Airbender for the first time. I absolutely loved the show and all its little underlying messages and values. Today, I was just messing around at work, working on writing left-handed(it's a hobby, I'm RH'ed), and I just wrote out the names of all the main characters; Aang, Katara, Sokka, etc.. When I did this, I felt a pang in my chest. It was like I was remembering friends I once had but lost. 

All my life(21M) I've always been into fantasy books and movies, especially when I was younger before college. But I gotta say, I've never felt like this before. It's like I truly felt these characters were my friends and upon completion of the series it was like saying goodbye to them, and wrapping up a chapter in my own life.

49,"I put this mask on. A mask of confidence. That I have everything under control. That I'm comfortable with myself. That I don't give a shit. I act like I don't want any deeper connections with people. And it's somehow working. I get all the attention I ever wanted. My friends see me. Girls see me. I'm not invincible. And I get it more and more. And it feels great! I feel invincible! And people see that! So I get even more attention, I act like I care even less and they keep giving more and more. I feel like a rock star. 

But then the day is over. I get back to my place. And I take off the mask. ""What a great day"" I tell myself. But then I start thinking. Thinking about my past. Thinking about who I really am. I take my clothes off. And I watch myself in the mirror. And I tell myself ""You're still not good enough. Your friends, they're better. They're more confident. They don't need the mask. They're who they are. You're an imposter"". So I start feeling like shit. Staring at the ceiling. Thinking about who I really am. And I start seeing who that is. How weak, fake and pathetic that person is. How much of a weak piece of shit he is. I feel terrible.

 I put the mask back on. But this time, it has a tear. And I try to hide it. It's not really noticeable to others, but to me, it's as obvious as the nose on a face. And suddenly I'm not invincible. I'm not a rockstar. I can't shrug off every little comment made by others. And I really can't shrug off the comments I make myself. I can't say anymore ""You're awesome. Fuck whatever this shit is."" So I give in. More and more. And suddenly the mask is just plastic. Plastic choking me. I can't breath. But nobody can see it but me. To everyone else, they just finally see the real me.

52,"[Here's a picture of what I saw](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/553850991959736323/686423021279379496/20200308_214536.jpg) when I opened my door to frantic knocking. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think everyone imagines what it would be like to open the door and just see a big fire way too close for comfort, or on the horizon. The red in the sky, and the smoke, what you see on the news but not in real life. This isn't a huge inferno that causes cities to evacuate, just our home at the top of the hill.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite it not being a cataclysmic hellfire, it still induced all of the feelings of survival. The distance liquid brain and too-clear vision, the lack of any bodily pain and quick jumping thoughts. I opened the door for my pets (they are indoor outdoor so they wont get lost) and grabbed my 7 year old for safety as the wind went from nothing to sudden gusts (mountain living) and the fire soared above our head and reached toward fenceline so fast. \[We didn't think the home would REALLY be in danger so there wasn't such a need to grab personal possessions and pack the animals into the vehicle, we also live super rural so they had lots and lots of open room to go to on their own.\]

&amp;#x200B;

She kept saying ""Mama I'm scared."" and apologizing for not doing things because she was pretty frozen. I told her that is a perfectly normal reaction, we aren't going to be hurt, the fire department is here, we're just going to park down the road 'just in case'. ""Can I bring my blanky??"" God forbid she lost her favorite blanket, ha. ""Yes of course."" She hugged it and I packed her in the van- the one time I didn't buckle us in, and crept down the road between people arriving to the scene. And then tucked myself off the road down a ways to sit in the dark and call people.

&amp;#x200B;

I got a call that the fire was contained and went back to see the fire now in neat narrow strips. Our fire department isn't big, just a few volunteers that are willing to grab vehicles and go with what they got, but one of the few men who showed up saw me and came over to reassure me that the humidity was jumping and it might rain, they would watch it all night. Before he talked to me I kept hearing him say loudly to others, ""We wouldn't let it reach that house!"" 

&amp;#x200B;

I told him I had a 7 year old girl, and she was scared, and thanked him profusely, for everything. I curled into bed with my daughter for a few hours until she fell asleep again, and all that is left now (hours later) is a little single burning spot in the distance. I can't thank the Marion County AR first respondents enough. They are amazing people and quite possibly saved our home, and got there just as the fire started to go from a manageable grass fire to 'okay this is a huge problem.'",09Mar2020,1

To get slim I don’t care to be ripped I just want to be slim and toned. I motivate myself to do a workout but stops after a day or if I’m lucky 2. I have literally no willpower at all if some food is put out I will convince myself to eat it instead of trying to not. I need to cut out food and again I can for a couple days but very quickly go back to old habits. Secondly, work. I don’t want to work I am in a good job that I don’t mind it’s just I procrastinate work all the time I literally just don’t want to do anything. Then I end up having to rush things because I have left it so long. This is a big problem because I’m bound to get into trouble eventually so need to sort it out. Lastly loosely fits in with work. I have ambition to go and do things in my career I am trying to up-skill myself and learn new things so I can start a business or get a new job in another area. I have the free time to do it but just never can bring myself to do it. I have a holiday coming up so thought I would give myself time to lose weight and had 200 days I now have 50 days left and haven’t done a single thing.

65,"I met her when I was 14 in a goddamn psychiatric ward. And before anyone says it, yeah, you shouldn't be making connections in a place where the other people are as mentally I'll as you are. But we did.

We were both in there for suicidal tendencies, and when she walked in that day-room my attention was immediately focused on her. It wasnt any kind of romantic feeling, it was more like I immediately knew she was important in my life. Almost how you can tell the difference between a quest giver and a normal NPC in a video game. She just stood out.

And she was important. We kept contact after we got out, and since she lived less than 10 minutes away, we became really close. And then after 8-10 months, we would have a big fight and stop talking. And then one of us would come back to the other. Then a year would pass, and we'd have another big fight, we'd stop talking, and then come back after a few months. And on, and on, and on...

She was there for me in my most critical moments. She saved my life when I was trying to end it multiple times. And unlike anybody else in my life, when she left, she always ended up coming back.

Recently, she came back after a long hiatus, and its honestly been the healthiest our relationship has ever been. It's hard to elaborate on without more backstory, but things were going really well. Like, actually heading towards a completely healthy friendship. But I fucked up.

I've known for a while that I would have to move out of my house at some point in the near future. One of my close friends and i had been talking about rooming together for quite a while, long before the previously mentioned girl had come back into my life. After some time of her being back in my life, however, I mentioned the fact that I would need to be finding a new place soon. Since she needed a place too, she suggested we find a place together.

And then I lied.

I guess it wasnt a *lie*, but I agreed. I didnt tell her I already had plans to room with someone else. She sounded so goddamn excited over the idea of us living together that I didnt have the heart to ruin her excitement. She sounded so hopeful that she would get to leave the toxic household she lives in now.

I went along with it, offhandedly, for months. When the topic came up, I changed the subject as quickly as possible. I kept trying to think of a way to tell her, but the longer I waited the harder it got to actually say it. Tonight I told her.

It felt like a ""now or never"" scenario. I had to rip the bandaid off before it got worse, and the tone of her voice when I told her was absolutely heartbreaking. I probably ruined her vacation in an entirely different state. She's probably on the phone with one of her other friends crying right now. 

I fucked up. I hurt someone I love. I have betrayed the most important person in my life, and I dont think I've ever felt worse about myself as a person before.",09Mar2020,1

1. follow the leader
2. develop your own
3. assume the opposite opinion

the first category of thought clings to what one has been taught and assumes that they are safe just believing what other people in authoritative positions say. this is usually a safe position that requires little effort compared to the other two categories. if you fall into this mode of thought you likely do not understand what you communicate and will say somethings that you later regret. people that think this way can be described as tools, n.p.c, sheep, lemmings, and partisans.

the second category of thought is the exploration of ideas. you will be frequently mistaken or incorrect but you are also likely to develop new ideas and find new ways to teach difficult subjects. when you know something, you know it well enough to defend it and debate it and you require little if any appeal to authority. this kind of thought is expensive in time and effort but also pays off big time when you stumble across some amazing truths. people in this mode of thought are usually older and spring from the first group after years of experience and shame.

the third category of thought is the most expensive in time and effort. when this mode of thought reveals the truth, the truth is usually dismissed out of hand by those who are in the other modes of thought (usually for good reason). the people who get caught in this mode of thought are the most likely to be susceptible to confirmation bias; they have a hard time separating correlation from causation. because of the nature of this kind of thought, it is usual to find that the people in this mode of thought also have mental disorders and a hard time carrying a conversation about anything but secret societies and imagined conspiracies.

now a few months on I'm doing better to a degree. I dont want to hurt myself anymore, but the rest is pretty much the same. I still feel worthless, It still hurts the same and I still miss her every day.

Not the whole thing. I would always be just a step away from her. How is that fair. 

but the other side of this is I'm starting to feel pretty lonely. I feel like there is nothing I can do about it. I can't stomach another relationship.

I saw this ad, and seeing as I haven't had a trim in about a year, figured, why not. I don't really care too much about my hair, so if they mess it up, it's no stress, I get a trim out of it and I get to help someone out.

It was seriously the worst experience I ever had in my life. She started prepping my hair, and starting going on and on about her personal life, about how she can't find a 'good man' and how (my city) is filled with ""fuck boys"" and ""dutty n\*ggas."" I don't mind conversation, but she started also talking about how she knows men want instagram models and how she wants to get liposuction so she can rope in a rich dude.

Then she started going through my hair, and she asked me what I did for a living/school. Told her I was still in school for X, and she started talking about her previous jobs. She told me she used to be a stripper in X city, and then came to (my city) and tried to get into stripping again but some dude who owned one of the local strip clubs here called her too fat, and then she warned me that if I knew any girls who wanted to work at that same strip club, I should tell them not to since ""(owner) is the type to ask you for 'favors' if you want work"" . Will do... thanks...

Again, like I mentioned, I don't really take care of my hair. That's when she noticed I had dandruff. I get it, I have dandruff. Every salon I've been to in the past noticed it, it's just the respectful thing to do that you don't mention it. I know I have it, you see that I have it, if you're uncomfortable with small flakes, put on gloves or refuse me service, by all means, but this woman started talking very loud about how I had dandruff. She mentioned it at least 15 times and even once to a nearby student. She kept repeating that I should be more hygienic and should shower more. Thanks for that. For anyone wondering, the instructor actually came by because she tried telling the instructor, and I don't know if the instructor was trying to save my face or was being serious, but she said that it was because my scalp was dry, and that I should try to use a certain oil instead of more product. I try not to wash every day because it's not good for my type of hair.

I come from a slightly below middle class family.

I was good enough academically so I managed to get into a prestigious school and most of my friends came from very well off families. I somehow managed to make a great group of friends even with my brash personality. 

I wasn't brash to be arrogant btw, I figured might as well disguise self doubt with over confidence because trust me it hurt, watching my friends have the coolest shit and go on vacations while having to buy things on sale only and such.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway so I managed to form a core group of friends and we make sure we have a sleepover once a year where we game heavily.

&amp;#x200B;

Now:

Anyway to now, I'm 22 y/o. All my friends are studying abroad and came here because they had a break. As per tradition, we met up and had a great time. Time to head back home.

We were putting on shoes when my friend, where we had stayed at, gave me a flat stick type of thing.

I didnt even know what it was called. Apparently its called a shoe horn and you use it to help your feet go into shoe easier. I struggled with it bc hell, I didnt even know they existed. They looked away for a moment and for some reason, it really stung.

&amp;#x200B;

I reached home and that moment, for some reason made me cry for the first time in a long while.

I just want to thank my friends who never judged me. They are one of the greatest friends you could ask for.

But this small thing really broke the camel's back today and made me angry and bitter.

Angry and bitter for not being abjectly poor but just enough to hang with your rich friends properly and yet, without being able to relate.

103,"I see some movies based on the 90’s or 80’s and it just makes me feel like I’m wasting my life away, I’m reaching my mid 20’s and there’s so much I wish I could have done but I decided to spend my time online instead. Part of me feels like it’s because of my anxiety since I decide to just run from my fears by staying online instead of facing it. 

When I see how people used to go to places physically a lot more and use libraries more (like when they had to research something or learn a new skill), and I know this is a silly since you can just do a lot from your home now but maybe I just feel like I’m addicted to the internet, maybe I would benefit from getting out of my addiction. 

I’m imagining just how much I could get done, and then when I want to do something for fun I either go to a show or movie theater (instead of only staying home and watching netflix). Just doing things more in person, reading books I can touch, buying art supplies by going to the art supplies store, talking to people mainly in person rather than through screens.

106,"Tbh I don't really know where else to post so I figured I would give this sub a shot. Basically I don't know if I am experiencing disassociation, depersonalization, derealization or something else. Since before year university, Ive been dealing with this (so around 5 years). Haven't gotten help but more recently have been looking into it and becoming contempt with the fact that I need to talk to someone. Before I went to university, I had an episode where I was high that made me freak out. Since then, everything hasn't felt the same. I looked at my parents and outlook on life differently. I think because of anxiety it has evolved to something else. I quit smoking weed almost instantly after this. I specifically have become hyper aware that life is in first person and that freaks me out a lot of the time. An example would be yesterday when I was driving, I looked onto a large city skyline and became aware of how open everything was and that I was experiencing it all in first person. I relate to somethings in disassociation but the thing is I'm a social person most of the time, and I always have been so I don't disassociate with people, more so reality, if that is even what it is. I don't know if this constitutes me as crazy or ""getting out of touch with reality"" but its just gotten to the point where I genuinely feel depressed that I don't have the same outlook on life anymore. Where I live, proper mental health outlets aren't a big thing and I want to see if anyone has ever experienced what I'm feeling?",09Mar2020,1
107,"when i was a kid in elementary school i was a shy, nice and warm girl.
in middle school i was bullied for some years. those same years i was diagnosed with mild depression at 13 by a psychotherapist. 
i went through stressful events like the bullying, loss of loved ones, moving 8 times in 17 years etc. 
what i have noticed early on in life was that death left me unbothered. i could never understand why other people would grief so much over something that couldn't be changed. i understand the concept but not the feeling itself. 

i entered my 2nd year in highschool (at 17) at a new school and everything was different. over the holidays i had a ""glow-up"". everyone wanted to sit and talk with me, i had a lot of friends. i had my first boyfriend then. he emotionally and partly physically abused me. it was a terrible experience for me. i broke up with him. my so-called friends still liked him and didn't believe me. 
because of this and other factors i came to the conclusion that i actually didn't like these people. at first i wanted to be friends with as many people i could, for the fact that i haven't had friends before. but i pushed most of the new friends away. 
the whole experience with my ex-boyfriend left me traumatized. after some months of me noticing my lack in active involvement of my surroundings, crying myself to sleep every night, not being able to get up in the morning, i was diagnosed with adjustment disorder and depression by two different psychotherapists. 
i was suicidal and almost got hospitalized. 

a few weeks after my diagnosis everything changed suddenly. that whole experience left me numb. i stopped feeling empathy for others. 
i was suddenly a rational person (apparently i am ISTJ) and would only talk to people when i would gain something out of it (for example temporary happiness or a favor) and i started manipulating people for my own gain. i think of myself as superior to 95% of the people that i meet. 
basically i became the opposite of what i was a few years ago. 
but to my friends, i am still a warm person and i love (platonic) them. on the other hand it wouldn't affect me much if they would leave me. 
i sometimes think about how i would torture my bullies from middle school for the emotional trauma they made me go through that made me loose myself. i know exactly in what joint to stick a screwdriver or what organ i could stab to make them die as painful and slow as possible. but i would never do that so don't worry. 
i always wondered what exactly was the trigger for my sudden change in behavior. 
for any of you suspecting that i have sociopathic or psychopathic tendencies please tell me about it. 
i just want to hear the opinion of other people.",09Mar2020,1

After dropping off Aries, Dude told me that he would’ve gone to the fair but didn’t have anyone to go with so i instantly felt bad bc he also said he had gotten off work 2 hours ago. I told Dude that i would go to the carnival with him but now that i’ve asked my parents if i could go they have questioned me as to why should my boyfriend be ok with me going to the fair with Dude. Looking at it through his perspective, it does seem suspicious and if he were to do that with one of his girl friends i honestly would feel the same way.  My boyfriend is not the insecure kind that prevents me from seeing anybody &amp; and that’s one of the reasons why i love him and for his gentleman like nature.

111,"Today marks two months since when my ten year girlfriend left me.

At the beginning I felt like garbage and pretty much useless. She left me because apparently she didn't love me anymore, because I wasn't there for her during an hard time with university and because she felt like we did the very same things over and over while she wanted us to do different things.

I don't wanna even vent about the fact that she didn't love me anymore, it happens sometimes.

What hurted me the most was when she told me I wasn't supportive enough. I'm a kind guy, I want only the better for the people I care about and you can trust me, she was (unluckily still is) the first priority so hearing that I let her so down that she left me was hard. 

I felt like I had done everything I could but I couldn't get over the idea that I could have done something more. 

Some days after she broke up with me (the day she left me she wasn't able to let out more than just some words at time, was crying a lot, so I wasn't able to understand well the reasons since I didn't want to put her in a worse situation by pressuring her to give me the answers I wanted) she was ready to talk and finally she started to explain herself.

Long story short the reason she started to think about leaving me was that she wanted to do different things but when I asked her why she never told me before, even when I had asked her during the summer, she said I should have understand her.

I would've loved to bring her in nice places but I was on low money (I work but low paying job since I also attend univeristy) and her mother was/is very protective to the point she couldn't sleep at my house. 

The last straw for her was that I wasn't supportive to her. In particular when one day she told me her professor just double the work her group had to do for the next week and asked me if we could see eachother only on Saturday evening (we usually saw eachother twice a week) and I told her I wasn't free that day. Only when we finally met to speak she told me that she had a panic attack that day and that I let her down in such an hard time and all that for going out with my friends.

When she told me that I was shocked. How could I've let her down so much? When did that happened? Am I for real so unsensitive? I felt like shit.

Days later I was still in struggle trying to understand. Finally I found the messages in our chat... nothing about a panic attack or something like that. Just her stressed, an evening spent togheter doing her favourite hobby, at her home after the gym (she even thanked me a lot for that) and the pic of the chocolate I had bought for her. 

I couldn't understand, maybe was in a call? Maybe an audio? So I asked her and again I should understood her by what she was writing and how she was behaving...

I suddenly realised that I felt like shit for 3 weeks only to discover I was not 100% the dumb trash I thought. 

From then, she left me in a very hard time for me, I tried my best to feel better. Sometimes it works but in days like today I feel like I miss her so much but I cannot forgive her for destroying me and crushing my heart. I didn't know you could hate and love someone so hard at the same time.

130,"I like talking about bad date stories. I don't know why, maybe it's just because I enjoy drama, and I'm bored and think this stuff is pretty entertaining. 

So, today I was listening to Man in the Box by Alice in Chains and that made me think of my ""ex girlfriend."" I call her my ex girlfriend because I don't even know if you could call it a relationship. We dated off and on for like 6 months, and overall it was toxic and fucked from the start, but it's funny looking back. 

I was young (er) and WAY more desperate and so I found this girl on OkCupid. She messaged me first actually. This girl was a few years older than me which was different for me, but she was really hot and I was hyped as fuck. 

We texted for like 2 weeks before going out, and we decided to meet up at this sports bar/pool hall...that she fucking worked at and that was an hour away from me, because she lived an hour away from me. I don't know why I was using dating apps at a time when I didn't even have a car yet, but I was, so in order to meet this girl I talked my friend into driving me and had to pay him gas money. I could've just used Uber, but for some reason I paid a friend to take me.

I show up there, and it turns out she is WORKING that night, so she tells me to just sit down and wait til she gets off work or go play pool or something. I'm like, okay, whatever, and sit there on my phone because some dudes are already playing pool.

She finally gets done and comes and sits down with me, but she seemed like she was drunk already. It turns out that night is karaoke night, and she's gonna do karaoke, and I agreed to do it too, even tho fuck karaoke. I just wanted to be cool, lol.

Well as we're talking, she just kept randomly getting up and talking to people, not introducing me or including me or telling me who they were, so I felt incredibly fucking awkward and out of place. I was like an emo skater kid at the time, and this was very much a ""Good ol boy""/townie type of place in this shitty ass country town in the sticks. I was out of my element. I was NOT about sports bars. 

Then she gets up and just grabs my hand, and takes me into a backroom where some other employees are having a meeting. It was weird because it was indoors, but there were no chairs and just rocks on the floor. I sat down on the rocks and then they all sat in a circle and started bitching about the managers or something, I guess one girl there was an assistant manager, and they're also smoking a joint back there and they at least gave me a couple hits.

 That helped me, but still, what the fuck? I was so annoyed that it was basically just convenient for her and it was her workplace and all this shit was happening that I didn't know what was going on. And I felt kind of bored, and wanted to leave, because obviously it wasn't like a real date, but I was stranded and my friend had dropped me off not too long ago. So I waited it out. 

Finally that ""meeting"" was over and then she said it was finally time for karaoke. She got up there and sang an 80s song, got pretty into it and she actually did a great job. I was sitting at a table by myself, and when it was over she brought a couple friends over, who were laughing at me and giggling/pointing. I asked what was up, and they were like, ""Nothing, you just look miserable right now hahaha and she thought you were bored of her.""

Wtf? Well that was fucking embarrassing, I felt super bad even though I wasn't having that great of a time. I apologized like a nerd and they asked if I was gonna do karaoke, I almost changed my mind but decided to do it last minute and I ended up singing Man in the Box by Alice in Chains. I did a pretty good job, but that was the last time I ever did karaoke. 

After that, the bar is getting quieter finally, and I'm happy about that because it was loud as fuck in there. We were sitting at a table again, talking about bullshit, but she's on her phone while talking to me the whole time and I'm annoyed. We eventually started playing pool, she was pretty bad but that part was actually enjoyable.

Some other friend joins us, and she and this friend are gonna go buy weed and smoke, and they invite me along. I agreed. This other girl was gonna drive us. I awkwardly sat in the back seat by myself while this other girl drove to pick us up the weed, and it was retarded because this was a hick town, so they were all paranoid about getting busted by the cops and for some reason she says we can't smoke at either of their houses.

We get it and we end up going to a random storage unit to smoke, but two cars are sitting there beaming their brights at us. We wait like 15 minutes and decided okay, fuck it, whatever, we're just gonna roll up. We got high and the two girls are up front talking amongst themselves and not really talking to me and I'm bored and annoyed again, so I'm like okay thanks for smoking me out but I need to go. 

The other bitch started saying she wouldn't drive me back to the bar?? I was like okay, fine, whatever, strand me at this storage unit then. My ""ex gf"" was like come on just drive us back to the fucking bar please, and she finally took us back to the bar. My ""ex"" said goodbye to me and acted like we had such a great time, and then texted me for the rest of the night, while I just waited at the bar for my friend to come get me for an hour because my ex left with the other bitch.

And yeah. Overall, it was one of my worst fucking dates ever, actually probably the worst, kind of a disaster, yet I still ended up having this off and on fling with her. Because I didn't learn my lesson :)",09Mar2020,1

I’m the type of person to put people first and sometimes that’s a good thing but it can also be a negative. I’m learning to find that balance. Sometimes my kindness and how deeply I care for people gets taken advantage of, especially in family, friends and relationships. The people who truly love you will understand and will be there for you and the ones who don’t aren’t the type of people you want in your life anyways. They won’t take advantage of your love and respect and in return they will give you theirs. 

Sometimes anxiety gets the best of me. I will no longer live my life in fear. I know I’m an awesome person and I shouldn’t tell myself otherwise. 

We are our own worst critic and when we think we don’t deserve something we are only sabotaging ourselves. 

It’s okay to be open, vulnerable, and honest. Once you’ve accepted that you’ll be able to love without fear of judgment or betrayal.

139,"We met in art class when we were 16 (now in our 30’s) but it wasn’t until our early 20’s we found we were “kindred” souls. It took years to realize it, but I’m pretty certain he is a narcissist with a dash of paranoid delusion. To avoid a long story, I’ll provide a bulleted list;


* took advantage of the fact I have a car and once I started saying no to rides, he lectured me on altruism (???)

* bragged about intimate connections he has with important people in government all. the. time. 

* threw an absolute bitch-fit when I started hanging out with his friends on my own because, they were *his* friends (this led to several years of no-contact because fuck that noise)

* plagiarized art. He took photos of high-quality graffiti throughout the city, reproduced it onto canvas, and sold it as his own. Fuck, I think he even displayed it in a gallery in the same city. 

* way into esoteric studies such as symbolism and parapsychology-nothing wrong with this, but when I tried to understand him better on this level by asking to borrow one of his books, he acted insulted and made me feel worthless for asking. 

* always says we should hang out and he misses me, yet when I ask when he’s free I’m hit with a patronizing “I work nights, hunnie” implying he’s too busy/tired all the time. 

* most recently he tried to get me to join a class with our old art teacher with him. I almost did before I realized the cost of the class, and the fact he was trying to get me to drop whatever I was doing as I only had a few hours notice. 


I’ve spoken my mind about this bullshit a little bit since he tried to re-connect, and I honestly don’t think any of it sunk in. He’s sent a couple pictures from our past as if I’ll forget everything and be friends again. I thought he got the hint from my silence for a couple weeks, until I got a text linking me to his go fund me for a book he wants to publish as a “PROFESSIONAL ARTIST WITH MANY AWARDS IN EXCELLENCE.” BITCH YOU PLAGIERIZED ART FOR POCKET CASH AND NEVER MADE A LIVING OFF IT DESPITE HAVING ACTUAL SKILL AND TALENT. He’s worked in retail and has never made a career with his talent. But he thinks I’m going to shell out cash for his art book project??? Get the fuck out of my face with that shit.",09Mar2020,1
140,"He was a gay slut. At the end of every service he'd take me to the basement where we kept our produce. He would pull his trousers down and stare me in the eyes. ""MY ARSE ISN'T GOING TO FUCK ITSELF IS IT BIG BOY?!?!"" I would just always reply with ""No Gordon."" I would then pull out my courgette and olive oil and begin penetrating his donut hole. After he came he'd scream at me ""CLEAN THE FUCKING STATION YOU STUPID IDIOT!"" ""Yes Gordon"" I would say as I cleaned his bum bum. He'd walk out of the restaurant and enter a car driven by Marco Pierre White. One time I heard Marco say to Gordon ""I doubt it's as sore as when I used to humiliate you in front of the boys at Harvey's"" I saw Gordon cry after he said that.",09Mar2020,1

For the past 10 years of my life I have been apart of the online service industry (SEO, SMM, Web Design, and Software development)

My mother was diagnosed with lung cancer 9 months ago and passed away last month. Being an only child it was my responsibility to take care of here during the 8 months she was battling cancer.

Of course I went through the denial stage, the anger stage and every stage in between.

So many doctors misdiagnosed her and told her she had acid reflux by the time they found out it was lung cancer it was too late.

While I was taking her to the hospital and doctor visits I got to speak to many doctors. During this time I thought to myself why not take my skills in web design, and marketing and turn it into something helpful for everyone.

I started doing research in 23 and me, ancestry, and every other dna company. I found that with the right software you can create a platform where people can find out way more about themselves from the same at home DNA test.

Things like: **Alzheimer's disease, Ulcerative colitis, Heart diseases, Stroke, Chronic Kidney Disease, Vitiligo (Skin Cancer), Breast Cancer (Braca 1, Braca 2) and the list goes on.**

**So I decided to begin coding. I created a software that takes your raw data from ancestry, 23 and me, and a bunch of other DNA providers and analyzes it, and gives you a full report of over 700 health related answers.**

I've also been in touch with a network of labs that will provide DNA testing kits, and clients raw data for my genealogists and software to analyze.

I guess my question is do you think people would be interested in learning more about their body? Things that they're predisposed to and how to prevent them from coming about?

Thanks for reading and looking forward to your responses.",09Mar2020,1

My grandma paid me $120 over the course of 2 weeks and I spent it all on juul pods, yes not a good financial decision I know. My grandpa found them in my room while I was gone at school today and took them, it was around 7-8 packs so they don’t just disappear I for sure didn’t misplace them. My grandpa has a bad memory and was probably going to say something but forgot. Now it’s up to me so how should I go about this",09Mar2020,1

Got the best mark in a mid-term exam without even studying...

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Understood some concepts faster than others with a higher IQ.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Declared incapable of going on my own to get a sick leave (I can order things online which is of the same complexity).

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One day I said something in the class, there was a discussion about drugs if I remember correctly with the psychologist of the school - I replied with something and a girl said 'they say he is retarded but in reality he is smarter than all of us'. / p.s. not that I really believe it but I did say something 'good'.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There was an assignment and I wrote something 'good' and the teacher was asking me all the time ''Did your father help you about that?'. I said to him the truth.... 'No'. He replied about that about three times ...'are you lying to me?'....

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also there was another MR guy who said something in the class - about a question... Another girl told that to a teacher-about it- and she said all in the class was surprised about that and left speechless...

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

They also said if I went on my own into some places I would get lost - in reality I never got lost.

It’s fine to compare them, especially when it comes to symptoms. But PLEASE STOP trying to claim they are variations of the same virus. They are not even *cousins*.

A hangnail and a gunshot wound both bleed. That doesn’t make a gunshot wound “just a different type” of hangnail. 

Additionally, yes, there were however many thousands of flu deaths this year and there have “only” been 22 coronavirus deaths (or whatever it is now). Do people really not understand how ratios work, at all? Is it really that difficult a concept?",09Mar2020,1

I just got one of my first midterms back for statics (one of the toughest courses in the university aka weed out), and I noticed a drastic error in the grading of my exam. During the exam I was on the last problem and there were 10 minutes left. If anyone knows anything about static’s, the exams are tough and the questions take a lot of time. there were two parts to the problem: the first part i finished and managed to get majority partial credit, the second however, I left blank due to running out of time. On my exam the TA graded the problem as 15.5/32. Fortunately for me, on the front of the exam where they tally up all the points earned on each question, the last problem was marked as 32/32 points. This brought my exam grade up 20% in comparison to if this error didn’t occur. My dilemma is, do I bring this up to my professor in hopes to have positive leniency in the future, or do I not say anything at all. 

TL;DR I got an exam back for a really tough class and I noticed a grading issue giving me a score 20% higher than what I shouldve gotten. Do i bring it up to my professor in hopes of positive leniency, or do I not say anything about it.",09Mar2020,1
