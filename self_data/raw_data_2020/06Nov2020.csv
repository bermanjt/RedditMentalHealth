0,"It's good to state that I'm an European citizen and I have no hands-on experience but miss me with that ""you're not from here. You don't know. It doesn't work like that."" shit.

America is first and foremost divided into two political parties that have opposing ideologies and better yet. They're both extremists. The Republicans see the democrats as communists while other way around the democrats see the Republicans as capitalists or conservatives. To add to this two parties can be enough for some country to fit all the views of the citizens but a country as big as good ol' America need more parties as I can bet that no one is truly right or left, they just don't have a choice.

You're also divided in every other possible way. The smartest and the dumbest people come from America and so does the richest and the poorest (though India and China might win that fight). But talking about the wealth, well, America is the only country in the whole world that is, at the same time, a first and third world country.

Americans are divided by their political ideologies, beliefs (don't forget all the cults), wealth and it's also divided into states that are miles apart in culture if looked at closely.

Thus I believe that the Divided States of America is the correct name for the country until they really revamp the political and governmental system. It's old and doesn't work on America's scale.

What I find most ironic about this is that America is supposed to be the beacon of hope and a guiding light for all the democracies in the world while almost any democratic country does democracy better than America. How about the DSA finally started to act like they breach other countries should?

And I'm saying this knowing full well that America could be in a civil war in a couple of days. I guess it just further proves my point.

I'm all up for polite discussion on the subject and I would like to know your opinions on the matter, American or not.",06Nov2020,0
2,"I’m a light skinned Mexican  so I guess I was sadly privileged in some way (and i say sadly because no one should experience privilege based on their skin tone) so I had never had anyone be racist towards me, my boyfriend is a white American. 

I was on FaceTime with my boyfriend while he was at work when I heard a coworker ask him about me and to see pictures of me (we are long distance cause I live in Mexico) and he literally said “she’s so beautiful, she’s gorgeous, nobody thought” which made me go like wtf, it got worse when my boyfriend showed him a picture of us and he said “she’s got the Mexican height”, he also made comments about how he was surprised I was Mexican because of my skin color, he knew I was FaceTiming him and I could hear him but I stayed quiet cause I didn’t want to start a fight. 

When he left my boyfriend was super embarrassed and said that his coworker is sadly a Trump supporter and an incredibly racist person who thinks Mexicans only go to the US to steal their jobs. 

I know what he said wasn’t nearly as offensive as other people had to endure but my heart broke in that moment because if that hurt me I can’t imagine how worse things can hurt others, I’ve sadly always been scared of racism when I travel to other countries because of my country’s reputation and it hurts.",06Nov2020,2
3,"But one day, it won't hurt anymore. I won't reach for my phone to tell you everything, I won't look forward to spending time with you, I won't want to spend all of my free moments with you and painfully slow I'll move on.

7,"Where a megalomaniac fascist leader - rather than committing suicide, goes on to learn how to paint and create pieces of art that we can all look back on thousands of years from now and say; “that guy wasn’t such a piece of shit after all”

Of course it works better if the works of art are actually that: inspiring media that people look at and feeling juices start to flow and they see - maybe many, many years later what the artist intended to show. 

I’m not going to search for anyone’s drawings after I click submit - I just wanted to put it out there.

9,"For the first time in my life, I voted in a U.S. presidential election. Now, I'm having second-thoughts about my choice, and as I watch the results come trickling in from the few states that are still counting, I can't help but feel disappointed regardless of the outcome.

I voted for the candidate that I feel represents my values the best. I voted for the candidate whom I believe will be the best leader for our nation and will do the most good for our citizens. The other candidate seems to me to be incompetent, disrespectful, and dishonest. I disagree with his policies and believe that they serve the interests of a narrow group of people to whom I can't relate, and I think that his policies will be damaging to the nation in both the short-term and the long-term.

At the same time, I feel as though I am not as informed as I should be. I do look into issues when I have time and try to understand them the best that I can, but I often have feelings of doubt when the other side makes a good argument backed up with data that I don't feel qualified to dispute.

These feelings are exacerbated by the fact that no one I know sees the world the way I do. My family, friends, and coworkers all lean toward the other side or are rabid supporters of the other candidate. The county I live in, in fact, voted for the candidate that I don't support at a rate of 75%. It feels as though I have no support, which leaves me often questioning my worldview. On the other hand, I don't want to just surround myself with people who completely agree with me. I just wish we could all talk about the issues in a respectful way and try to do what's best for each other.

I know this is a difficult time for everyone, and I'm sure many of us are asking the same questions. I guess, in the end, I want to know: How are you navigating through all of this, and how can you feel confident that the candidate you support is the right one without dismissing others who disagree with you?",06Nov2020,1

11,"TW: Mention of people with mental health issues 

Okay so I (20)f tested positive for Covid on 8th September after my dad (55)M did, Both my parents are doctors so he probably got it through the hospital. After that things just got worse, My parents are separated so. I went to my mom's to isolate and after 3-4 days my dad got admitted into a hospital. Following days both my grandparents(who lived with my dad) also tested positive and were admitted. My brother (24)M who lives with my dad was then alone at home and he has been diagnosed with depression, suicidal thoughts, severe anxiety  and OCD since a few years, so everyone was worried for him too but he managed himself. My mother who was also diagnosed with schizophrenia and depression many years ago took care of me during my isolation period. Then my brother suffered loss of taste and smell and started having panic attacks so my mom managed to get him at her place to look after him which was a task in itself because we couldn't touch him or be close to him. After a few days my dad got shifted to ICU and so did my grandfather. Then I myself recovered from Covid but got infected with another severe infection and was unable to eat and my mom had to literally give me meds through an insulin. After a week of me being sick and missing out on almost a month of college my dad and my grandmother got discharged from the hospital and went to his sister's place. My brother and I came back to my dad's place cos my brother wasn't comfortable staying at my moms. then after 2 weeks my brother and I went to visit our dad and our grandmother to my aunt's house and they told us that our grandfather passed away 20 days ago and they couldn't tell us because we were alone at home and they were worried. They also told me that while my father was in the ICU he was also at risk for a while about which I wasn't told and the doctors and everyone else was scared for him too and even now he has to take medications and has post covid damage. While i'm also stressing about college cos i missed 80 hours of lectures, I don't know but I envy all of my friends including my boyfriend. My best friend and my boyfriend were really supportive throughout this time but my boyfriend is pretty affluent and his family+ family friends used to have these amazing dinners and fun nights for the major part of the quarantine and then he went out for Uni and even now is able to hang out with his friends and everything. While other people too that I personally am really close to have been going out and enjoying while I've just been at home from the start and nothing has happened to those guys, I don't want anything to happen to them but whenever my boyf. tells me he's going out to meet his friends although where he is things are much safer it pisses me off and I become a little rude towards him. It's not his fault but even now after recovering I haven't met a single soul and my home isn't a very happy place, It's not violent but it's just sad. So I just get mad and teary whenever I see everyone getting to do whatever they can while I'm in a house with college stress and family stress and just  never ending misery. And just feel like a loser.",06Nov2020,1

14,"So for a few years now I’ve had a pain under my left breast and it seems to get worse whenever I have indigestion.

Back when I was at university I went to the doctor because I was in the middle of exams and I was eating a lot of fast food and the pain got to the point that I couldn’t stand or sit without this pain being really bad, the only way to make it stop was to lay down completely (no pillows or anything or it still hurts, my body had to be completely flat) and the doctor prescribed me some indigestion pills to take during the month and it helped me during that time and I wasn’t having the pain anymore but then after a while it came back again. I don’t think that the issue is just that indigestion causes me this random pain but rather there’s something else that is wrong with me and it gets worse when I have an indigestion.

15,"I’m 14 years old black girl and my entire school follows the Left ideology (mainly by posting in their stories to spread awareness)

Never minded about politics, I prefer having my feed filled with jokes over the Trump and Biden debate. I didn’t mind about people voting for Trump if they think that he could rule the country better than his cowards and didn’t understand why people were triggered every time a celebrity voted for him even in our democratic system. 

As you read I’m not the majority of what people think on politics. I believe I should just have shut the fuck up, follow the masses and disliking trumpies/conservatives although I don’t give a shit about what they think about politics and too tired to all make them change their mind.

23,"So for about 9 yrs I've had a-fib, but the when it started I would have episodes maybe like once a month and fast forward to now its almost everyday. Sometimes it messes up 1 or 2 heart beats and goes away other times it last 8-10 minutes and i had a Cather ablation done, but they were not able to find anything so the doctor tells me i have 2 options , medicines or another procedure, that one being Pulmonary Vein Isolation Ablation and he was pretty confident it would work. But I don't wanna go through another procedure and not have it work. Also he said this procedure comes with much higher risks like a fistula or stenosis. Are they serious and life threatening? What is the percentage that it would happen? I don't really know and i just turned 18 so medicines with those side effects just seem unreasonable to take.

24,"When I was a little boy I used to play on my GameBoy Advance an awful lot, it was amazing and I'd spend it playing all manor of Pokemon games. The reason I played it so much was not only because it was awesome and I loved it, but it was also because my parents were going through a divorce at the time. My father used to hit my mother a lot, I remember coming home one time and saw a kitchen knife imbedded into our front door with a note on it. He also used to pin me down onto the floor and spit on me. I also had a next door neighbor, at the time he was in his late teens and I was around 10 or something or maybe less, he invited me over as we were friends, because I was friends with his younger brother, he took me up to his shed to get the lawn mower out of it and he sexually assaulted me, it was only years later I realised he tried to rape me. Eventually it got too much for my mother and we left my father. She didn't and doesn't know what my neighbor did. We ended up going with my little brother into a woman's refuge and spent a long time there until we got a lovely place in the countryside, all the while with me playing my GameBoy Advance. One day at school I walked out onto the field and didn't realise I had done that. So, my mother took me to the hospital where they stuck wires with sticky things on the end onto my head and sat me infront of a screen that emitted a strobe light, it did not effect me. It turns out though I had Petimal Epilepsy, so I took tablets and a liquid form of medication, it was fucking awful tasting. My mother told me that my grandmother's brother had Epilepsy as well, he drowned in the bath whilst having a seizure, but thankfully mine eventually disappeared. 

(skipping later into my life, around the 20 year old stage)

Because of an extremely stressful in my life I had developed anorexia, I’m 6ft 2 or 188cm and I had stopped eating for roughly 3 months or so, to the point where I had a BMI of 18 and my hair began falling out. It took sometime but I eventually beat my eating disorder and remain 11 stone until this day. Which I’m very proud of as not many people can do that. But because of the stress it put on my body and brain, my Epilepsy had returned but it was different this time. I now had full on seizures. So my mother took me to the doctors once more and it turns out I had Grandmal and Petimal forms of Epilepsy, once again I had to go on medication, Lamotrogene, I’m still on it till this day. After many years of trying to figure out what causes my seizures we determined it was from high amounts of caffeine and aspartame, any form of alcoholic drink and stress. However, it’s only when I wake up it can happen. Anything that causes a high amount of activity in my brain when I wake up can basically cause it to overload, leading me to have a seizure. I take 400mg of medication every day, 200mg every 12 hours. I’ve been t-total for many years now, I never drink energy drinks but even if I have a single caffeinated drink and go to sleep before the effects have worn off I have to set my alarm to take an extra 100mg in the night so when I wake up there’s less chance of a seizure happening, because even if I take my 200mg when I wake up, it can still happen.

(skipping on 7 years to this day)

I’ve skipped those years because if I were to write everything that happened this post would be thousands and thousands of words long. I’m now 27 years old, in that time I have multiple seizures. The worst one being falling back onto a concrete kitchen floor at my best friends house, waking up in the back of an amulance. My friend told me that I stopped breathing, the paramedics revived me and I began having another seizure, but  whilst the paramedics had to hold me down in the back of the ambulance he put a windpipe down my throat to help me breathe and I apparently threw up blood all over him. I was dead briefly and there have been other times where I’ve stopped breathing but that’s been the worse. I’m 27 years old, I've only had one job and that was KFC, and right now I get help from the government money wise as I'm technically disabled, I don't spend it on myself, I give it to my mum and spend it on my son as I find it extremely embarrassing so buying myself anything with it would be even more embrassing and seem wrong. But for the last 4 years I haven't had a job, even though I have qualifications from IBM, Amazon and Google respectively, but I do have some interviews lined up. With everything Epilepsy and many other things happening in my life I have not had a chance to get a job or at least found the courage, as I’m too scared to live by myself as a few times whilst having a seizure I’ve opened the front door, and have walked into the middle of the road, but with my mum being there nothing happened. Additionally being a dad and having a son worries me, because every time he stays here I worry I’m going to seizure infront of him, so living alone with him scares the hell out of me. No matter how careful I am, I have a seizure at least once a year like clockwork, which stops me from being able to drive, and living in a village with terrible bus services make things harder. 

People know of Epilepsy but I wanted to elaborate what is like living with it, as some people may not realise how difficult it is. I've probably missed some things but it gives you a good idea of things.

REDDIT NEEDS A BETTER ""SPAM DETECTOR"". 

I don't care about karma. I am here for the discussions. Sometimes it's helping someone out, sometimes it's having an open and honest dialog on a controversial issue. But in all cases, I believe that it's the community's job to decide on visible content through voting - not for admins and mods to decide behind the scenes and in secret.

That's what drew me to reddit a decade ago and why I've spent so much money to help support this platform.

What makes this ""spam"" censorship so bad is that it's covert. You aren't notified that your comment has been hidden, or given a reason why. You'll never know that you're secretly suppressed unless you suspect something like I did, and log out of your account and see if your comment is still visible. Absolutely nefarious.

So, what was this comment that pushed me over the edge into making this post? Surely something inflammatory about the election or something, right? Nope.

I replied to a top-level comment on the ""pics"" subreddit that someone else gave gold, where the person made a joke about submissions needing to have a ""sappy title"" to get attention. I made a comment with three subreddits and a brief description of each: one subreddit lampooning this phenomenon, one subreddit for actually visually interesting photos, and one subreddit that would actually be appropriate for the submission. Not even links outside of reddit.

When I realized that it was ""caught in the spam filter"", I made a new comment containing just one of the subreddits and description. It too was silently spam filtered.

This has happened to me DOZENS OF TIMES over the past year or so, and with increasing frequency.

30,"As an 18 year old, I didn’t really know how to draw boundaries with friends (didn’t have many since I’m also anti social). Became friends with a guy for during that time and it wasn’t a pleasant experience. He had complexes and he would repeatedly put me down to make himself feel better I guess, he would make comments about other people’s bodies and because I was horribly insecure at the time myself it made me uncomfortable for both myself and others. 

We stopped interacting and I just forgot about it but we ended up on a project together and he was a nightmare to work with because he wouldn’t do his part on him. When I got on his case he made an excessively rude statement which I simply reported to the instructor (who did nothing).

A close friend of mine was a good friend of his throughout. He knew about my issues with the guy but would use the rude statement as a joke. More recently I told him to stop it because it was annoying AF. He has since made the joke a couple of times again and apologised but the last time he asked why this statement specifically annoyed me, I went off. 

Close friend defended the guy saying he had some issues and wasn’t a bad person and that he was okay to everyone else even though he accepts that he was horrible to me and proceeded to repeat that the guy was only horrible to me and was okay with others.

I don’t honestly know how to feel about this statement. I feel hurt because whether or not my friend intended it, his statements make me feel like shit. I can’t help but get the idea that for him his horrible behaviour is excusable because it only happened to one person.

I feel hurt and also I am now questioning what it was that made him bad to me only if he was okay with others. The only thing I remember is that I had difficulty enforcing boundaries and shutting people down when they got too rude. I honestly don’t know how to feel.",06Nov2020,1
31,"What do I say, alright this isn't too much of a story but I thought I'd share it because it's pretty funny.

I took a shit in someone's back garden, and it wasn't intentional. I go to College and I'm able to leave/enter when I want as long as I go to lessons. I didn't have any more lessons for the day so decided to walk around the village the College is in. I ended up going to a Park and met a friend, and stayed their after he left for an hour or so. 

There was this one big swing which is meant to hold like 3-4 people like a pancake shape, I end up sitting on it on my Phone listening to music. The swing reaches the highest point of the swing like where I would be facing the ground and I ended up slipping and basically belly flopped into the ground, winded myself and busted my lip. 

I recovered and went on a walk again. As soon as I start walking I feel a poo is brewing, and it brews fast. Maybe it was the fall on my Stomach which caused it but I really needed a poo. But I was covered in Dirt and couldn't get it off, and I wasn't going back to School covered in dirt, and people asking me why I had it on me. So I decided I would shit in the wilderness, I walked out of the village into the outskirts where I thought it was just fields and empty roads.

I followed this road which led straight out the village for about 10 minutes, I got really out of the village. At this point I'm about to blow, I can't hold it.

There were only fields around, and obviously I can't just shit in the middle of a field; I could see with both fields on either sides of the road there was an area of trees and bushes and stuff. Perfect to privately take a shit.

I walk into the bush area, and there is just this perfect spot. A tree stump which is surrounded by bushes except for the front which is like an entrance to it. A natural toilet. So, I do it. Easier than I thought, I thought I would fuck it up somehow but nah, very easy.

I had to crawl through a small gap through the bushes to get into it, so I thought I would go out the other way and back onto the road. As I was walking down the other way, there was an Apple tree, an abandoned greenhouse and shed, I didn't clock at first but thought nothing of it.

Then I saw a house to the right of me, like a bungalow and there was a line of trees blocking me from getting to the road.

I realized, the bushy area in the middle of a field was someones back garden. I shit in someones back garden. As soon as I realized there was just immediate shame. I feel it just writing this.

Man, if the person who's garden that was is reading this. I'm sorry, I was gonna shit myself otherwise.",06Nov2020,1

This is deeply disturbing to me and I promise I’m not proud of it at all but I for some reason I feel like I NEED to prove to myself and to believe that I have suffered a lot. I know this is a major victim mentality and that’s part of what I feel so deeply ashamed about. Self pity is the worst. I genuinely want to get out of it.

At the same time, shocking myself into reality and self-awareness, as I try to do often, by practicing gratitude and putting things into perspective elicits hugely painful and intense feelings of rage (and self-rage) and shame.

It’s about accepting myself as the cause of most of my problems. In theory I truly believe that and think it’s a wonderful thing to believe and act on, because it means you have control over your life.

When I read online or in books about people taking control of their life they seem to do it so gracefully. As though they have this epiphany which liberated them, but they do not talk about the crushing guilt and shame and anger towards the self that naturally accompanies that self-awareness.

It can’t be religion, as roughly half or more of you are atheists. 

It can’t be “traditional family values,” you had premarital sex, had sex under your religious parents’ roof. “Conservative” girls are all going to college with a career in mind, have debit cards, take out loans, have no desire to be a housewife, and aren’t virgins. In other words they’re liberals even by 80s standards. 

It can’t be “law and order,” I saw you fuckers illegally smoke weed, vape, and drink. Some of you even shoplifted from target. 

It can’t be opposition to gay people existing, because none of you would dare claim that homosexuality is a choice in 2020. Rather you say Trump has done more for the LGBT community than any other president before him. 

It can’t be taxes, 5 of your households combined doesn’t even make the $400,000 needed to be further taxed by Biden. 

It can’t be guns, none of you even own guns, nor do your parents. Your single dad can’t even own a gun because he’s a felon, Caleb.

41,"She was about one year old, maybe a few months less than, she was very small. The smallest kitten and then cat I've ever seen. She didn't flinch or run away from people, which made her so sweet and also disadvantaged. She had two cysts on her back, and she was an outdoor cat only. Because of our landlords not allowing us to have pets. My husband assured me that they would pop on their own and they would heal. Cats are resilient, as we've both seen before, but she got infected. I could tell she was in a lot of pain, and he kept saying he would schedule an appointment for her, but he kept forgetting. Meanwhile, she smells, is in pain with puss, and then she started getting maggots. It was awful. So one day I gave up.

I wanted to keep her before. I really cared about her and even broke the rules for her sometimes. I gave her a special name. However, I could not stand to see her in pain anymore. We couldn't do a walk in because he works until the vet literally stops accepting them for the day. So I made the quick and easy decision to turn her into animal control. The woman who collected her assured us that the small cat would be treated for her wounds and taken care of, and given to the humane society afterward.

I was so relieved and I'm happy for her. Some cats can handle living outside and are smart. Some just aren't. That was my small cat that I couldn't truly adopt. She was born under my house, and I had fed her and cared for her for a long time.

I won't miss her, or regret giving her away, because I feel like I did the right thing. I couldn't dedicate the resources to take care of her, and I had waited too long to properly assess her problems. I didn't want her to suffer anymore than she had to.

So I'm 39, and planning on receiving a vasectomy on the 16th of this month. The doctor already reviewed the procedure with me, but it wasn't until after that I had a million questions. I know they make an incision and clip then stitch it closed, then I have to wear a cup for I dunno how long and I'm just afraid of just simply sneezing and it pops open and I bleed out and die. I have two kids, 1 and 3, and they love to jump on me. I don't know if I'll be able to care for them for that week? Month? How long will I be uncapacitated? What if I need to make a bowel movement? If I push too hard will the stitches rip and I'll die? I don't ""process"" daily, only once every few days, and I normally have to push. I also get horny a lot, have the sex drive of a rabbit in heat, will getting an erection the first few days hurt? What kind of underwear should I be wearing? Should I ask for a full week off of work? Two weeks? I'm a graphic designer and spend most of my time at my desk. My wife told me I don't have to do it if I don't want to -- I only wanted to get the operation so she wouldn't be so afraid of doing it because we no longer want kids.

46,"A few months ago friend 1 called me a hypocrite bc i was going to the gym during the time the covid cases were super low and it was allowed with the proper procedures(which i obeyed), i got super mad specially bc another friend joined in to call me a hypocrite and none of out other friends went to defend me, even tho one of them told me in private that she agreed with me. 

So anyway back to the present, friend 2 told us that she went out with her fling last week and she believes thats how she got covid, and was talking about how she was going to go to another date with other guy next week when shes better, and i noticed how friend 1 was agreeing and stayed quiet during the conversation. So its hypocrite when I do it but when its someone else its ok? She never even apologized for being a bitch, i ignored it and let go. Its bullshit, and no one calls her out or defends me when stuff happens, im always the punching bag. Not even gonna comment how whenever i share something i liked they, except for friend 2 and another one, pretty much ignore what i say.

51,"Okay this'll be a long one, I've been meaning to post this for a while but never had the time to do so up until now, I just want to vent off and hear some thoughts, nothing too exciting. It's 1am, and I just got back from my friends'. Sorry for any spelling and structural mistakes, english isn't my native language, and I've been awake for a tad too long than I should.

You can call me Blur, so, I'm 21 years old. I'm currently a 2nd year student at the University, studying english literature. My life has always been a rollercoaster and I believe that is what life is. Except that I'm tired and I kind of want to just let go of everything.

Let's start with Uni, I hate university with every living cell in my body, I wasn't able to study what I love, architecture, due to a 0.1 mark miss (I got 214.9 at the BAC exam, architecture needs 215) so that hit hard, what hit harder was the fact I attended for a whole month before knowing that I actually missed the mark goal and I didn't get it. So I went to the next thing I can, which is Trading and Economics, something I actually like I attended an another month there. But my parents being the typical asian parents, wanted me to be an engineer. So they forced me to study Mechanical Forces Engineering, a faculty which I just can't love. I even joked about as if I'm to ever study it. Anyway, I forcefully studied it for the rest of the year, and failed. No surprise there. My parents saw this and lost hope in me, so I was allowed to go to whatever I want. I went with something I love the most after architecture, which is english literature. At first it was hectic but I managed to scrap by and actually got myself pretty high marks. I finished the first year of it and I have no subjects that I failed in, and I got 80-90 on all my subjects (out of 100) except for two, which I got 74 and 78 respectively. Things were going well, my parents seemed to accept this seeing my marks and they actually seem happy and proud of me.

Now during this time I decided to better myself, I was clinically depressed (and have been all my life), had self harmed, and was suicidal with an extremely twisted inner personality that I show to no one. I went to a therapist, got myself on medics, and to further enhance their effect I read hundreds of books about self discipline, self restoration, and self improvement. I also went to the gym and I tried to explore things that I find uncomfortable so I can be better.

At first it was hard and I nearly killed myself, but things got better and I managed to escape the depression hole I was in. I was good at uni, good at socializing, had better coping mechanisms, and generally I seemed to be doing well and nice.

Enter the second year of uni, this year. Thanks to some old work I did for UNHCR I managed to lay myself a job at a general educational institute, an art teacher (and potentially an English teacher as well). I'm an artist so this is good for me. I also started private tutoring, so in additional to my job at game and character design, I was doing pretty well. 

And here where things are just.. a mess. I feel like I bit more than I can chew, private tutoring, art teaching, general work, university, girlfriend and relationship building, and keeping up with a regular weekly DnD sessions with my friends. 
If I'm honest, they're pretty normal, and I can definitely handle all of them neatly into my schedule. But mentally I've not been well. I feel like I want to cry for no reason, but no tears come out. And I long for the days of depression, where I curl in a corner and forget about time. It could be because I'm just weak, or just because I'm entering into adulthood and I should take responsibility from now on. Which is true, but I feel weak, and dreary. And I have to hide this from people because I'm tired of speaking to them of my problems because I get the same answers and reactions. My therapist is a good man, but I don't feel any different entering his flat than leaving it.

I have to keep up with so many things all so suddenly I'm feeling drained out. But I have to continue on because looking around me, people and friends have an even more packed up schedule and work than me, yet they don't have any problems with it, I even asked and they say they are absolutely fine.

And it gets to me, that I'm really just a weak person who's incapable of responsibility and work. I have so many good job opportunities and life opportunities yet I want to snuggle back into my self destructive hole. And complaining is something I hate, quite ironic of me to say this while typing this wall of text, but if I complain ""oh I'm so tired my schedule is packed up with all these good job opportunities and good like stuff"" it would seem that I'm a shitty person who likes to show off. As if I'm not grateful for all of these but I am! It's just, I'm overwhelmed. 

I can't eat -- but I force myself to because I need to gain weight for the gym. I can't sleep -- but I need to otherwise I won't be able to function properly. 


Sigh..
I don't know.. I sometimes wish if I can give all these good things that I have to someone else because I'm an ungrateful person, I have all these things, it's true, I worked hard, I worked very very very *very* hard to get all the things that I got. Except that everytime I get something, I feel emptier and emptier. I wanted love? I worked my ass off and got that. A woman whom I'm sure would jump off the ledge if I tell her to. I wanted good work? I worked and did interviews and searched everywhere and got that. I wanted good marks? Sleepless nights and I got the best that I could.

Yet why is it that I feel empty?? I feel alone, I feel depressed, I feel weak, the more I know, the more I gain, the less I have. Right now I'm just numb to everything new, nothing excites me anymore. Absolutely nothing, and I tried pretty much everything that I wanted to try. Instead of happiness, instead of joy, instead of hope and gratefulness. I feel alone, isolated, depressed, sad, numb, and want to cry. 

I feel like I'm choking, I could to throw up at a moment notice. I feel heavy and tired.

And that makes me even more depressed, I was in a bad situation, sure, there's an excuse to my depressions and mental health. But some years later and after loads of hard work, I have the life that I wanted! Or thought I did, now I don't know. To be honest I don't think there's anything I want anymore..

Suicidal thoughts are back, I want to self harm, I want to just cancel everything and let the whole thing simmer to a black ash and finally be in my comfortable depressed zone where. Sure I will be feeling shit.. but I'd take depression than this.. this is numb, this is cold, this is alone, even more alone than before.

I don't know what to do, what to say anymore.. I just want to be happy, I don't care for money or anything, I want to feel happy, just once!! Is that something hard to get this much?? Or all the other people on earth are just pretending happiness and I'm just realizing that now? Am I really this wimp? I guess so.. 

Sigh.. sorry for the post, I'm just. I have no one to talk to-- no, I have so many people to talk to.. but no one who would understand, they'd take it personally and say I'm spouting nonsense.. maybe they're right. Maybe there's something physically wrong with my brain. I don't know

I'm sorry.. I just want to not exist anymore",06Nov2020,1
52,"I asked my friend if she planned to vote a few days ago and she didn't give me a straight answer at first. She kind of just froze up until she finally started blubbering excuses without ever actually saying the words or even the orange man's name. Through the while conversation she never said it out right.

Her biggest reason was that her SO works for a fracking company (we're from Pennsylvania), and they were afraid he would lose his job if Biden won. And even though I assured her that Biden isn't going to ban fracking in PA and he's said this over and over, she said she didn't believe him. I was flabbergasted and I asked her why she could believe Donald Trump, who lies on camera and then lies about lying on camera, literally every day, but not Joe Biden. She gave no real reason except that's just how she feels.

So, I started explaining about climate change science and the elemental cycle and she cuts me off and says she knows all this because her SO has a frigging **master's degree** in *environmental science!* I had to hold back a scoff. I told her that if that was true (she's literally never said this before) then they ahd nothing to worry about and he would literally never have trouble finding work. She dismissed this with the claim that he only works for environmentally safe fracking companies because they do care about the environment.

I'm also black and she assured me over and over again that not all republicans are racists. (Wtf?!)

But still, the fracking shit really pissed me off. If this a man has a whole masters degree, then why would job security be above stopping climate change on their list of priorities. They have five kids for God's SAKE. That, and when she said that it's totally fine to vote for Trump because she knows a few doctors, *one of whom is Indian*!

55,"My father is a narcissist, a drunk and a pedophile. He abused me for 8 years, and only got 2 years in prison. He was let out in September 2014. I received the equivalent of $7,000 as compensation. I have tried to re-open the case to try to get him a more appropriate punishment, but it's impossible because he has already served his sentence. So I will never get justice for what I experienced. 
  
My mother is also a narcissist. She has only ever cared for herself. Whenever I had a problem, or struggled with something, she felt sorry for herself for having a son with problems. She never expressed empathy or love towards me. Everytime she said ""I love you"" I could tell she was lying. She must have told herself that same lie enough times to start believing it herself. She was never married to my father. He always lived 7 hours away from where I grew up. My mother left him before I was born, but I had to visit him on holiday several times every year. 
   
Since August 30th 2015, 2 months before my 16th birthday, I've lived in foster care. My foster parents don't abuse me, but I was put here at least 12 years too late for it to have an impact on my upbringing. I will never know what it's like to have a loving mother and father. And it's far too late to do anything about it. All I can do is live my life for myself, until I get tired of it. We all die sooner or later, so it doesn't really matter. At least I have that to look forward to. At least I know everything will end, one way or another.  
  
I don't want children of my own. I have wasted enough of my life stuck in a broken home. I refuse to risk getting stuck in another one. I'm better off on my own. Besides, I never cared for romantic or sexual relationships. I'm better off living alone. At least I have a few friends whom I see a couple of times per month. But they can't make up for all the love and care I never had as a child. They can't make up for all the things a proper father should have taught me. They can't make my constant loneliness go away. It only goes away for a bit when I'm drunk. But I can't stay drunk forever. Too expensive. I only drink around my friends. 
   
All I ever wanted as a kid was to have a real mom and dad. Two parents who loved me. A father who would have taught me valuable life skills such as self discipline, how to handle failure, how to deal with being bad at new things in the beginning, believing in myself. My father never taught me any of that. All he ever did was violate my body, and tell me how stupid I am for not getting something right the first time. 
   
I'll never know what it's like to have a proper mom and dad. And there's nothing I can do to change that. It's a lifetime too late. I guess I wasn't worthy of love. But it's alright. I've lived 21 years without love, and I'm still breathing. So that must mean that I'm weak if I want love. Since I never got it in the first place, I'm supposed to just live without it.
