19,"I just wanted to share that I use to be in an abusive relationship with my son’s father. Due to that, and even more events from the past, I’ve had an extremely hard time communicating with people and I’d just turn to shutting down and putting up my walls with people. 

I recently started seeing this guy, and he’s amazing and wonderful, treats me and my son extremely well and has been nothing but kind and understanding with me. He’s been extremely busy with work so it’s been hard to see each other (I’m also in nursing school full time), so I started getting a lot of anxiety about him losing interest in me. I also started obsessing over his social media to see what he was doing and making myself even more paranoid. 

I eventually texted him and respectfully voiced my concerns and I was so scared that they would make him upset and that he would think I was being dramatic for no reason, but he responded back kindly to me and was understanding and supportive. It was really hard for me to say anything, so I’m extremely proud that I did that. It made all my anxieties go away and gave me a chance to tackle problems I have in myself due to insecurity. It also makes me feel a little bit closer to him because he understood some things I have problems with and I could hear what he was having problems with and we could find ways to solve these issues. I haven’t been in something this healthy and I’ve made it a point to not sabotage myself when this is something that’s very good. 

Just wanted to share!",10Dec2020,1

29,Hey I am needing some advice/help! I have an unemployment hearing soon and I am unsure of what I need to do on my end. My previous place of employment denyed my unemployment request. Even during the pandemic. I am a Kentucky resident. And because of the pandemic I have struggled to find stable employment. My other job that I had at the same time as the one that denied me has yet to open back up. The place that denied me is a group home and I was fired because I did not perform a hold correctly even though it was my first time having to utilize the a hold of any kind. I asked for retraining so I could do better at the job but they decided to just let me go. And my other job was an afterschool program that hasnt reopened since March. I don't know what to do. I might lose my home soon if I don't get some money. I need all the advice I can get before my appeal hearing. Thanks in Advanced.,10Dec2020,1
32,"I'd much rather stay here at my job and get some overtime. My boss never gave me a straight answer when I asked him if I could. I guess I'll be going home then.

Home sucks. I have nothing to look forward to when I go home. It's a waste of time. It's easily the worst part of my day. I really just wish I could spend every waking minute making money in some form or another. 

I sometimes contemplate just living out of my car. What exactly am I missing by doing so? Showering? Doing Laundry? Easily done at a gym and a laundromat. I'd save so much money. I would also have access to some spots I know for a fact I would not be messed with if I parked and slept there. I really don't see how I can go wrong here at this point.",10Dec2020,1
34,"Yesterday, when I went out for the 2nd time by myself (no choice) to buy some materials I need for my school, I saw these group of friends sipping their milk tea. I thought it's time to challenge my social anxiety and get one too. So, I did. I went there without having any idea how to order 'cause I usually let/ask someone to order for me since I'd be too overwhelmed and they don't mind it anyway. 

I practiced what I'd get, the size, and the sinkers etc. I thought that's all I need to know and they'd be making my drink already. BUT BUT BUT NO, they had to dropped a bomb on me. They asked, ""Your sugar level, Ma'am?"" 

WHAT THE HECK DID THAT MEAN? I didn't have any idea  so I started panicking and searched the deepest part of my brain for a response that I ended up overthinking it too much. That's right, TOO MUCH. I thought they're being extra careful since we're in pandemic and if you have high sugar levels, they wouldn't serve you. (PLS DON'T ASK WHY 🤧) 

When I believed I got it, I cleared my throat, feigned confidence and said, ""I'm not sure, but I think it's normal. Yea, I'm normal."" 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 GIRL ALL I KNOW I'M NEVER GOING BACK THERE AGAIN",10Dec2020,1

37,"It’s been almost an entire year since I saw you in person. A whole 365 days. And ever since then I have not been okay. I think about you every single day, most of the time it’s in the morning doing my makeup, or in the car driving.

You would think that blocking out memories, blocking your number, deleting some of the pictures would help, but nothing has helped. In a room full of friends, I’m still upset. I feel alone. I feel like I have no one to talk to. I go through monthly phases of being somewhat okay and pushing through the pain, but then the next couple months it comes back twice as hard. 

All I want to do is see you. All I want to do is cry in your arms. All I want to do is hug you and kiss you. I want to cuddle you and call you bubby again, I want to make dinners with you again, I want to text you and tell you how much you mean to me. I want to go on late night food runs with you, I want to argue with you, I want to know how much you love, or at least, loved, me again. You were my person, you are my person, you will always be my person. 

I heard that everyone falls in love 3 times in their lifetime, and I was hoping that was true. But every time I think about it I can’t believe it. I am never going to find another you, and I don’t want to. All I want is you. It makes no sense to me how even after an entire year of not seeing you or talking to you I still feel the same. And I think that’s how I know you’re my one.

But then another part of me, probably the sensible part, reminds me that I don’t even know you anymore. I know who you were a year ago, I know who I fell in love with, I know of the idea of you in my head, but a whole year can change a person. I haven’t heard your voice in a year, I haven’t seen you in a year, I haven’t talked to you in a year. And yet I still love you.",10Dec2020,1

47,"I have zero confidence in myself. I'm in my 20s and feel utterly incompetent. In university they kept saying we were studying to become ""leaders"" in our field. I can't even go grocery shopping without getting a bit overwhelmed by all the choices and the people around me.

People usually go to university so that they can get a better paying job. It's a huge investment and privilege to be able to attend. Then there's me, who went to university simple because I was told to do so and was completely clueless about my future goals. I had nothing to go on other than fear of failure and ended up squandering my entire experience. I still have no idea what I can or even want to do. When I think of what job I'd be a decent fit for, I think of minimum wage work. Like maybe I could be an ok cashier or delivery driver. I kind of enjoyed my part-time job at a bar, but the thought of an office job fills me with dread. Sure I took lessons in software programming, but how could I ever become a programmer, like really, me? Someone who is slow and easily confused / overwhelmed by the simplest of things? What use could I possibly be to anyone...Why would anyone PAY me, when there are thousands of other graduates with better grades, projects, internships...as well as people from less developed countries who probably studied far harder than me AND are willing to work for less.

I've already written out a will leaving my things to my sister.

53,"Pretty much my entire life I wouldn’t ever be in the moment, I’d always be in my head stressing over one thing or another. I couldn’t socialize since I’d find it hard to focus on a conversation. My thoughts would be cloudy 100% of the time, I’d always be anxious and never able to sit still because it would just make it worse on me. This made school too difficult so I used games to escape.

But the other day it just changed, and I don’t know why. I felt free from the chains of anxiety, I could think properly, I didn’t stress over talking or texting. I felt like I could say things without being judged, and not caring either way. It’s as if my personality did a 180

Compliments my friends would give me would actually go through, instead of me being insecure and thinking it’s bullshit. I could look at people normally without feeling like they are judging my appearance. I could sit down and do things I enjoy without procrastinating.

I can’t really explain how hard it’s been with my anxiety. I isolated myself, dropped out of high school, and sat indoors for 9 years. I never felt normal, or that I would ever make it this far. It was so difficult getting a job because I’m horrible at first impressions, interviews, and I had zero social skills outside of talking online.

I wish the best for others suffering from this chronic anxiety for longer than I have. I hope this isn’t a deterrent but more of a reason to keep going. PUT YOURSELF OUT THERE.",10Dec2020,1
54,"Like many others, this semester has been a rough one on my mentality..  I(22) started off strong but slowly as the weeks went on, my depression started to grab me into a chokehold. School started being second to just trying to take care of myself and not spiral too far into my depression. My city has been getting too dangerous since the pandemic started so I never could just go out for a walk like I wanted to unless I had a friend or family member with me, which was rare to convince them into it. Finding some reprieve in playing games or drawing became a chore because I was already sitting at my desk a few hours a day just for school alone. I designed my room to be my comfort space, to be able to wind down from daily stresses. My room lost that appeal over the months and it feels like hell to sit in my room for so long, but going out into the rest of the house isn't always possible as it's too active for me to be able to just relax with one member of the household or because everyone is already asleep. I work the graveyard shift full time. I used to just work about 35 hours a week but over the past couple of months, I've been having to work more hours and now I'm almost constantly working about 38-46 hours a week due to one of my coworkers being quarantined. I would just not cover them except we get busy as hell at night due to being one of the few 24 hours shops that have been opened since the summer and an extra hand is always a relief to have for us. 

I have no relief from everything going on in my life like I used to. Working full-time, going to school full time, still trying to find at least 10 minutes a day to still see my family, and still trying to get a decent amount of sleep? I just haven't been juggling it all as well as I used to. I dropped a class I needed right before thanksgiving because I had fallen too far behind on the material to still save my grade. I just submitted my last final in a rush only to check it after submitting it to see that something corrupted while saving the files. I've emailed a fixed version of my final to my professor. I doubt he'll accept it though. I don't know how I barely passed my other two classes..

I haven't signed up for classes next semester and I honestly don't want to. I want to just take a break. Just one semester off.. I could use the time to finally get myself back in order again. I know I would because I already want to, I just didn't have the time to do everything I needed to. I also don't know if I even can due to being on financial aid and living home rent free on the condition I'm still in school. 

I'm just at a loss. I want to cry. I just want to sleep and wake up to having the answers I need. I've asked the right questions I needed to but I've never been given the answers I need. They've always been just ""maybe"" or ""we don't know for sure.""",10Dec2020,1

58,"This is going to be very hard to explain. Sorry if anything I say doesn't make sense to you, it barely makes any sense to me. This is my first Reddit post as well, I came here to see if anyone knew about me. No one I've tried to talk to has, they've all just called me a liar.

&amp;#x200B;

Well here we go, I'll just go all in, if you have anything that needs more explanation o

I don't believe I have much control over my head. What I mean by that is I don't have much control over my own thoughts, and when I think about things it has to go through a checking process to see if my brain actually wants to think about that. It feels like me and my brain aren't one in the same. I used to say it was like someone else controlling my head but I don't know if that's really the case, it could be that but it's nothing I've ever heard of. 

Here's how I came to that conclusion; 

\-When friends end up leaving or we have a falling out or just don't talk anymore I find it hard to miss them or want to go back to them again, even if I really liked talking to them, when they leave it's like they never existed in the first place. I want to be able to miss my friends and cry over them when they leave but I can't even if I wanted too.

\-I find it extremely hard to cry or to care. Crying is something that I don't do very often, probably less than once a year. Even major events like my mom hugging me and crying doesn't have much affect on me. Caring is something ""I'm not allowed to do"" as I like to say. I can't care for even the most important people or things in my life. I want to be able to care and cry and to have things matter to me.

\-nothing I ever do brings me joy at all. Nothing I do is actually fun to me, video games, drawing, walking, playing with my dogs, going out anywhere. None of it brings me any joy, I don't know why.

That's all I have to say as a start, if you have any questions I'll answer to the best of my ability.",10Dec2020,1
62,"Hello.

I’m a female in my young teens. As the title goes I have extreme fetishes. I’m pretty hyper sexual, but that doesn’t bother me. What bothers me is that my sexual preferences/needs are so bizarrely different from that of my friends... I find it hard to talk about sexual stuff with my friends because I don’t want people to see me as creepy, or disgusting. 

I also don’t believe my sexual preferences/needs are normal for my age and was wondering if I should see a doctor/professional about this?

For starters, beastiality and shotacon have been the only things I’ve been able to get off to the past couple months. I don’t have an attraction to animals or young boys in real life- that being said I’m afraid that in my adult years I probably will...

A couple other things that sexually stimulate me are blood, urination, public sex, etc.

I wish I could explore my sexuality normally like all my friends. Get off to straight vanilla porn or whatever.",10Dec2020,1
67,"Recently, I've felt that my brain has changed.

When I mean by that is that I feel like my brain has developed a little more. I don't think it happened suddenly, it's just that I've realized that very suddenly.

I'm no longer a kid, I'm an adult, and it's time for me to take on all the responsibilities that I'm not even aware of yet.

The early days of waking up, having my mother pick out the clothes I wear, and going to elementary school and being taught easier concepts are over. The days of going to my nana's house and making arts and crafts, glueing together popsicle sticks to make a terrible looking house, and playing video games all day are also mostly over.

I may miss the past simplicity of life, but there's nothing I can do but feel nostalgic for those times. I must move on.

These past seven years of my life have been lonely. Obtaining friendships was almost impossible, especially in real life. When I went into homeschool, it got even worse. Almost all of my real life friendships faded away, and my whole family was involved in two car accidents that I wasn't aware of.

I felt suicidal, I didn't understand anything even though I knew most of what was going on. My life crumbled in only the span of half a year, and that was when my dark period in life started.

At this point though, I feel better. I embraced the loneliness. I never self-harmed, and I never ever attempted suicide. It was a lonely couple years, but I've found a few online friends.

I won't mention my friends' names, but they've helped me look forward to every living day. I don't want to leave here anymore, I want to spend my time on this earth doing what me and my friends love.

This pandemic may have sucked, and it will continue to suck especially for my country, but the few online friends and communities I'm in keep me motivated to keep living.

I'm glad I stayed strong, and I hope I live a long and amazing life. I hope whoever's reading this also has one too! Life is short, so enjoy it to the fullest as long as you can.",10Dec2020,1

74,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/

87,"I don’t know what I should be doing. 
Feeling low as if I am drowning in the thick of reality, as I hear downstairs chattering of family.

My chest feels numb, though I know, the rainy cold weather doesn’t help. I struggle with my mental health to which I am trying my best to not bring up, as I become dependent on that to explain my behaviour.

The guy I am dating works four days long hours shift and doesn’t like labelling me and him as a relationship. He says it brings him pressure, anxiety and fear. 
I don’t mind, I think... it just makes me sad how his earlier relationships affected him a lot.
But I care about him. I try to be a good partner.

I feel claustrophobic in this world, it scares me... everything about it seems so scary. Just, I sometimes have energy to face the day and reality in general... other times like today, I just want to hide for hours non stop. I want closeness from my boyfriend but I know he wants his space and I want to respect his rules.

Life scares me for how continuous and flowing it is. I don’t know how to face it... since as a kid I realised how the world has so much pain in it. I wonder where I can actually be someone.

Everyone in this world is so focused on individualism, so, I hope I am not disturbing you for asking for some advice on how to face life, a new day everyday... 

I am trying to find something to do to keep me busy... other than listening to music and aimlessly calling opportunities I see ads of... my days are passing by like that. 
Yesterday was my birthday, what I realised was how much I am actually ageing... I remember myself younger wondering when I will grow up, now I just wonder what’s the point.

Nothing bad happened in my life... yet, I struggle, however I have only minimal effects of the mental health disorders I am diagnosed with... or so my mother says. I believe she is right. 
I am very ungrateful and don’t realise how much people are struggling and went through so much... and look they are doing something with their life. A job, education, hobbies, socialise, family... dreams and aspirations.

I have just insecure dreams, I don’t know what I want long-term... the fear of the world keeps me inside. 
If I were to share my 3 personal goals of now... I would say: I want to document myself, I want to see how I will change; I want to dress up more like I used to do when I was child, I would love to just express myself; lastly, I want to express that confidence as a child to speak to people no matter who they were... I don’t know how to do it though...

I want to get a job to show I can do something... but... I feel so up and down that I am not sure if I will be able to keep a job... I want to earn money though... this thought keeps me distracted and stops me from working on my personal goals...

I wish I could let go... of this fear, this invisible cloud above my head, this shadow following me and putting intrusive thoughts in my head... I just want to live... but I don’t know what that means for me personally...

I search for answers in astrology and personality tests... how to describe myself like everyone else does.

From 2012 Until 2016 I worked in a bar it was great and had good mates and  a gf. but now I look really  bad. my hairline has receded more (thick hair tho) my face looks puffy skin looks very dull and Iv now got what I think may be rosacea on my nose which is incurable. (juts a red nose and puffy middle of the face) and nothings worked to fix it. 


I can’t even play ps4 of a night like I used to because I’m too down about it. The light on the screen to my face makes me feel it more. My libido doesn’t help matters too. 

I havnt left the house hardly since 2016 tbh. I felt totally fine then.  Just every night 9pm to the shop over the road and even then I wear a hood up and a snood. And have to avoid the shop and go to another one 1km further if there’s a gang of girls/guys outside.  I was fine up until I hit 29 then this.

I smoke weed some days and drink most night too I have too admit. 

And I drink a fresh 75cl cold bottle of water every morning in fresh air  and sometimes cranberry juice or aloe Vera.

108,"I keep imagining that a lot of people who owned a lot of stock will be able to send their kids to better schools, have better retirements, etc while a lot of my coworkers will likely go through some hard times.

I can end up better off - if I find another job that is as good or better then its a win. But I also know a lot of people at the company will be worse off for it.

We have about 10 months. It is not for sure we will all lose our jobs, but I expect our area (we are a HQ function) to be hit hard. 

The way it works in the US for most people is if you have about 6 months of unemployment, you are screwed. I'm sure we'd get a small severance, and maybe they'd continue healthcare for a few months. But after a few months, you are on your savings. 

There are other ways you can lose in assets without really losing a paycheck. If we had to move for another job, we'd probably lose most or all the equity in our house as well. I know a guy that moved and in the process lost $40,000 in equity in his home due to market changes (he sold at a low because thats when he lost his job).

In America, if you go unemployed for any length of time they will \*graciously\* allow you to borrow from you own 401k. They will even allow you to defer your mortgage payments (but of course, add the missed payments onto principle with interest!).

I am 100% ok with a few people making a lot of money on this sale. What pisses me off is how those same people lobby to cut the safety net and pass on more costs to everyone else via paying lower taxes. 

I could not imagine losing my job with 3 kids and a family to support. I couldn't imagine doing it in a downturn and you just watch your assets disappear and your house eventually get taken.

I’m responsible so it was never a question of responsibility and I love animals, didn’t understand why I couldn’t have one, like everyone else.

So I got a hamster during lockdown, she’s sweet, lives in my room, let her roam free sometimes.

Said to my dad I’m gonna get a hamster for Xmas, he wasn’t happy, at all. My idea was I “get one” so I don’t have to hide it anymore, clever right. Yes, shut up.

Anyway, he’s just offered getting 2 guineapigs for in the garden cos he doesn’t want a creature in the house. Now I think about it I’d probably be happier with my hamster. I like her an like that she’s inside.

It’s a paradox cos I wouldn’t of got the opportunity to have guinneapigs if I hadn’t been saying I’m getting a hamster.

I’ll turn down the guinneapigs and remain with getting a hamster, even keep it a secret for a while longer, I still enjoy her.

I wouldn’t want more small creatures right now while I’m happy with my hamster.

Now comes my turn. I was lucky enough to be smart and programming was my passion from a young age. I didn't mean to brag but luckily, I was very good at it, and started earning really well even before I went to college. I kept working hard and eventually got an internship and later a full-time job in Europe. At that point, my income was like €50K/year, which is ridiculously high for my developing country standard. I kept working harder and smarter and just last week started a new role with a pay of $104,000 USD/year. Now I am officially rich by European standards too :)

132,"


I was born and raised a Jehovah’s Witness. Until I was 18 I considered myself as “part of the religion”. I say this to give some context and provide understanding to what I’m going to talk about. Being raised a Jehovah Witness means you don’t get much education about sex and your own budding sexuality. All you’re really told is that sex is only for married couples and that you should avoid it and anything of sexual nature at all costs until you’re married. And that, even after you’re married you shouldn’t watch sexual movies or watch pornography or listen to sexual music. The only kind of sexual behavior you’re “allowed” to engage in is sex with your spouse of the opposite sex. So as a young kid, going through puberty, with almost no education or information on sexuality it lead me to do some things that I regret. 

Mainly sexting and sending pictures of myself to people on the internet. (when I refer to “it” from here on, I am talking about sexting/sending nude pictures of myself to other people on the internet, just so it’s clear) It started when I was around 13, I don’t know how or why I started doing it. I just did. I would only send pictures to people who asked for them. I think that was part of the appeal. “Wanting to be wanted” so to speak. But that meant I sent a lot of pictures to a lot of the wrong kind of people. People who wouldn’t hesitate to ask for pictures from a kid like me. It wasn’t always people who were older than me. Sometimes it was to other kids my age. Kids who I assumed were doing the exact same thing I was. The main app I used was Kik, I’m sure a lot of people are familiar with it. It was absolutely filled with kids doing the stuff I was. And even more of the worst kind of people who were there to watch. 

Every time I did it, I felt absolutely terrible about myself. So terrible in fact that I would often think about and attempt to kill myself. All at such a young age. Despite all that, I would still do it, time and time again. For a long time when I was young, I thought the reason I did it was because I was a “dirty person” a “sinner”. I thought god hated, that he was disgusted by me. I remember often times after I would do it, I would pray to god on my knees while balling my eyes out, begging him to forgive me. As a Jehovah Witness I was taught that suicide and suicidal thoughts are wrong. Because to kill yourself would be giving up the gift of life that god gave you. So both those things on my young mind was a lot for me. Now Jehovah Witnesses don’t believe in the classic “all the good people go to heaven and all the bad people go to hell”. In short, Jehovah Witnesses believe that soon there will be an “Armageddon” where all the evil on earth will be destroyed and the good ones will be sparred to turn the earth into a paradise where they will live forever. So I would stress that I wouldn’t make it into paradise, and I would be left to die in armageddon because of the things I had done. 

I continued to do it until I was 18. (I’m 19 now, turning 20 in march) But I didn’t do it nearly as frequently as when I was young. Around 16-17 I only did it every once and awhile. As I got older I got smarter about how I did it, and who I did it with. I never did it with anyone who wasn’t closely around my age. And as I transitioned into adulthood I made sure to never ever do anything like with anyone underage. I also never sent anything to anyone who didn’t ask for it. I think a big part of it was me just wanting to be wanted. I wanted them to want to see me. Most of the time, I was never very excited to receive pictures. I would even seek out relationships where I was the only one sending pictures. I think I just wanted someone to want to see my body. I wanted them to think I was “hot” or “handsome” or “pretty”. 

Till this day, i’m still not exactly sure why I did it so much. Why would I put myself through something that constantly and consistently caused me pain? I’m not entirely sure. There’s a few things I think might have attributed to it. Probably my less than comfortable religious upbringing, maybe the fact that as a kid I was sexually assaulted, not by an adult but by another kid my age. Maybe it was my parents and how they raised me, maybe they didn’t give me enough attention, which caused me to seek sexual attention from other people. Or hell, maybe i’m just a nympho and I was just a horny teenager. But I think what I went through and what I put myself through alludes to something more than just mere horniness. It wasn’t until I was around 17-18 where I realized that doing it was a form of self harm for me. I came to the realization that when I was mentally well or happy I wouldn’t have any want to do it. But when I was depressed or not feeling good about myself, that’s when I wanted to do it the most. I did it both times after the two break ups i’ve gone through. Usually doing it would follow with actual physical self harm. 

But nowadays I never plan on doing it again. Now I just live with regret and fear of it. I wish I could go back to my to talk to my younger self, and tell them not to do it, and tell them that they don’t need it, that they are loved and that they don’t need attention from someone who only sees them as a body or a means to pleasure. I wish I could tell them that one day they’ll meet someone, someone who loves them very much, and that they’ll experience a pure and loving form of sex. One where you don’t wanna kill yourself afterwards. But unfortunately I can’t tell them that. I just have to live with it. Nowadays I have more fear than regret. I often fear of those pictures of me surfacing somehow. I fear of them following me for my entire life. Maybe that’s irrational or maybe that’s a totally plausible possibility. I’m not sure. Now this might sound far fetched, but my biggest dream and motivation in life is music. I want to become a successful music artist, have it be my career, have it be my life. What I fear most is that maybe one day i’ll make it, i’ll become successful and I’ll get what i’ve been working for for so long. Then all these pictures and things I did when I was younger will come out and everyone will be able to see my biggest regret in life. Now maybe that’s irrational and silly, since that’s assuming I even will be successful. But I truly think about it everyday.

138,"Hi, passerby. Will you tell me your story? I know we’ve had different lives, hurt different people, run different races, lusted over different jewels. It occurs to me that the courses of our lives will never converge. I have never been who you are now, and I never will become who you once were, or who you will come to be. And while I have become who I am at this moment through good choices and bad mistakes, I cannot possibly have the insight that you have acquired in your quarter of our world. But my eyes are wide, I’m jealous and greedy and curious and I want to see what you see, because I want to use your experiences to my own, selfish benefit.

You are however old you have become: maybe you’re a teenager wrestling with existential questions, an old woman gone back to university, a Middle-Aged businessperson seeking redemption, honour and wealth, an influencer chasing fame and validation, a human who managed to dress themselves for a walk outside today for the first time in years. You have seen and experienced life in a unique way that I have not, and cannot, and yet yearn to espy for my own internal profit. Will you take my call, just for a moment? I wonder if we might both learn something.

May I introduce myself, briefly? I want you to know where I’m coming from. My mother died when I was 19, six years ago, when I was studying at university. She had been sick for two years and in the end she was ready. I did poorly that semester, of course, but I don’t beat myself up about it. I used the insurance money left over to take a mortgage and buy a small apartment in our city, which I rent out to pay the loan. In 2017, I finished my degree, late, but I was still proud. I doubled in Philosophy and History. I liked studying the Middle East, especially the Arab-Israeli conflict.

I didn’t go straight into a “proper” job, whatever that means, when I graduated. I worked in retail and saved. And then I travelled. I went to India and Sri Lanka, to Russia, Mongolia and China, around Europe. 

When I came home, I took a job at a bank for six months. But by then my field of vision had gotten too big, and the bank’s was too small. I left again, and went to finally see Israel and Palestine for myself. I walked into Jordan and Egypt, I flew to Turkey and hitchhiked through Georgia and Armenia.

After all this travelling, I thought I should come home and get a “proper” job. But instead, I detoured to spend a summer working in a hostel in the South Island of New Zealand. For fun. I was lucky enough to be in New Zealand when the pandemic started and the borders closed, and here I am now, a year later - 25-years-old, working in retail again, part-time, and enjoying my life in safety and beauty.

But, as you’ll have guessed, it feels like I’m on the precipice of making bad decisions. This is where your wisdom comes in.

I want to become somebody my mother would have been proud of. I don’t want to squander the unparalleled opportunity I have been given, growing up in a country with free healthcare, no such thing as private student loans, a government with masterful control over the virus, and the circumstance of owning an apartment (though, of course, I would give the latter back in a heartbeat if my mother could be returned to me). And yet it seems all too easy to brew a delicious, sweet tea  - and burn your tongue on the first sip.

Despite my degree and travel experiences, I am skill-less. I didn’t study carpentry, engineering, science, technology, medicine, law, plumbing. I studied things I cared about, and then dismissed gainful employment to seek personal gratification in travel and easy options. I learned more in the Middle East than I ever did at university, and yet this seems meaningless in our world. 

I am happy, safe, comfortable, relaxed. I have a positive affect, a good mood. I love my life. But this isn’t the same thing as being satisfied. I want to do and be more. I suppose, in a way, ultimately a comfortable amount of money will be a part of it. But more importantly, I want to contribute in some useful way. I want to be useful. I want to make my mother proud. Even if that can only ever be in my own head.

So at 25 I haven’t “made myself”, gotten marketable skills and started “building my empire”, as the YouTube gurus would have me berate myself about. 8 years after finishing high school and three years after graduating from university, I’m not really anybody, according to the internet. But I feel like I am somebody to myself, or at the very least a potential somebody. So what happens next?

The questions that I beg of you are contained within the stories I hope you’ll share with me. Your stories of success and failure, what you discovered was important and what didn’t really matter, in the end. Who are you, and where are you going? Does satisfaction ever arrive, or is it an endless treadmill? Does that mean we shouldn’t strive at all? Do you think I’ve failed? And by extension, what about yourself?

How do we not fuck it all up?
