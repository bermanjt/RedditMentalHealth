So I’ve been seeing this girl, and I would have sex with her 7 days a week. But because of this whole virus situation, I can’t have any sex. It’s literally ruining my life right now and I’m literally shaking because of it. I’m just like u/flyingp1zza haha right guys?!?",19Mar2020,2

3,"Like many of you fine internet strangers here, I am slowly going insane on day 3 of quarantine and so had to get this off my chest.

Early in the year I started dating a very sweet and gorgeous guy. After a couple of months of really fun dates and sleepovers he ends it because there wasn't a deeper connection. Kind of sad but he's ultimately right, you want to find someone you see yourself marrying and we didn't really have that.

Well what do you know, as soon as I can start trying to meet a new someone, the iron fucking curtain comes down. No social areas open, no bars or common activities or anything remotely resembling public gatherings. Dating apps are a bizarre purgatory where you chat to people and get along with them and then... promise to link up once things aren't so dire, which who knows when that is. And I'm alone in this apartment cycling between my laptop, my books, my video games, and it's just so sad because I am SO isolated and lonely, and facetiming with friends and family only does so much. 

The social-isolation-together posts hurt so much to see too, because I'm stuck thinking about this ""relationship"" that wasn't even all that, but that would have still made this prison-cell torture a million times better by far. I would give an uncomfortable amount to have his company right now. I sincerely don't know how I'll manage 10 more days of this.

7,"I got back on my twitter a few days ago and I saw a few tweets I wouldn't have wanted to see back then. But it actually worked out now because what I saw really plummeted my opinion on a thing I used to hold dear. It was incredibly pathetic. It was clear there were a lot of lies told and proved what I had already known. The personal ""problem"" was really just my presence... because apparently someone else would be just fine in the place I once held, not a problem at all. I can now happily move on and go on with things I held off for so long because I didn't want to ruin what was. It's clear now that I shouldn't have held new things off but I can fix the new things now and this is gonna be happy af. ",19Mar2020,1
9,"Honestly, my wife and I  don't really hang out with people, we have friends but we are homebodies who shun most social settings and much prefer the company of each other, the internet, and TV.

11,"I mean I've been aware that I'm single. I broke up with a long term boyfriend just over a year ago. We were together 5 years. I started dating someone shortly after. We dated several months. I've been single since the end of July last year. I've had a couple flings and even a few second and third dates. But my heart wasn't in it. And honestly, I'm not sure if it would be right now. So until now, my singleness came with a fun side to it.  But being stuck at home, and not drinking, (a huge change for me btw) I wish I had a partner, or a roommate, or just another human being I was close with for cuddles and being my true self to share my worries and my joy, a board game, and my dinner with. I don't really care about the sex stuff. After the last boyfriend it's like my heart was in my nether regions and both were ripped out and neither have completely healed. It's the intimacy that I miss. I come home, sober, and feel trapped in my house, trapped in my head and I have this sadness that I can't really tell if I'm lonely, or if I'm bored, or if it's just my general depression. But what I know is I'm alone and that sucks.",19Mar2020,2

15,"They do this because they sense their own social, educational, professional, financial and INTELLECTUAL inadequacies... and they are too fucking lazy, ignorant and non-motivated to do what YOU did to improve yourself, so they hate on YOU because unfortunately... this is all they fucking KNOW. This is why it is important to understand why those you leave behind will hate on you, clown you, criticize or ostracize you, and it's up to YOU to be intelligent, wise and strong enough to know it's not YOU they are upset with. It's just their own social and/or racial programming, lack of self-confidence, mis-education that results in what I will characterize as ""misplaced anger"" when introduced to the person they would *like* to be but feel they can't... and this is not your fault.

Yes it is possible to help SOME people by sharing advice and encouraging them to finish high school; go to night school; take online courses; go to college, trade school or join the military. You can tell them to leave the drugs and street hustling alone. You can advise them to improve their grammar, appearance and try to talk to them about their mentality and outlook on life. You can try to find tactful and non-offensive ways to help them understand that there is life beyond the inner city or some trailer park, but some people are going to be offended no matter what you say or how you say it. You can talk until you're blue in the damn face to try and show them the way and inspire them higher but here's the sad truth with some people: They see the inner city, ghetto or trailer park environment as home'; where they belong... and where YOU belong as well. It's a crag-in-the-barrel and if you're Black, then it's also a ""Willie Lynch"" thing.

Some people are simply victims of families, peer groups and environments that have convinced them that they are PRODUCTS of those environments... and to act, speak or aspire to be otherwise is a form of race betrayal or denial or one's family and roots... and this is both tragic and a damn shame! There is nothing you can do about people like this except love them or lose them because they will never change unless they find there inner light. This is the light within that let's a person know that it's not a matter of who's better than who.... it's a matter of realizing that we are ALL better than the low-income environments from which many of us came, and all we have to do is allow ourselves and each other to BE better. There is so much power in this mode of thinking, and the day people tap into this is the day they will stop being envious; hating on one another and simply coexist with the common goal of succeeding in life.

23,"This is just a place for me to sort out my feelings.

I just realized that my three closest friendships are barely friendships at all. They are all incredibly one-sided and I have to put in so much time and effort to try to talk to them. And to some extent I get it. They are busy people. But I am so sick of always being the one to reach out and talk. Sometimes I will send a message and not get a reply for days. When I do they never seem to care that I texted them and they just ignored me. And they never ever reach out to me. In fact, I am sure that as soon as I drop out of their life they will notice absolutely no difference. I guess the only good thing to come out of this is that I will now have so much more time and energy to devote to other things.

 I am still not over the girl that I asked out who rejected me. We never even went out. I knew her for 4 months. It's been 2 months since she rejected me. It's absolutely pathetic. Even now, when she hugs me I feel absolutely right. Just happy. Of course right after I feel garbage. And she doesn't even care. Like she doesn't even remember all the times she does flirty things or touches me. She just flits through my life making me hurt and she doesn't even care enough to remember.

And I don't trust my roommate who I am rooming with next year. After I asked said girl out, he met me and spent 2.5 hours absolutely blasting me for asking her out (he's her best friend, but still) because apparently, my timing was trash (it was, but very much not an excuse to blow me back especially when he was the one encouraging me to ask her out). Topping it off I am coming to terms with the fact that I enjoy putting on makeup and may even want to crossdress (if only in the confines and safety of my room) but I don't trust him with that info and I am incredibly worried about what will happen if ends up finding my makeup or any wig/dress I get.

25,"We are kind of freaking out. The CDC just confirmed that this virus is airborne and all the hospitals in my city don't even have the right supplies to protect their staff. They are sweeping things under the rug and making people sign an 'in service' saying that they acknowledge a regular mask is okay to use instead of an n-95 mask and that it's okay to put corona virus patients in a regular room instead of a negative pressure room. They are then going to put the nurses (including my wife) in these conditions. They have hardly even questioned the staff about recent trips/travels and have not really seemed to take it too seriously. 

Im genuinely worried for my wife because her immune system isn't really that great. Common illnesses hit her pretty hard and I think I'm just starting to worry about if she gets something like this.

30,"I went to a lodge and one 60+ year old man who had been a member for over 30 years made a sexist joke at the expense of women, implying they're unable to understand cars beyond the surface level, he clearly said this to feel me out and see where I stand in regards to women and it was revealed his childish nature when I didn't laugh. One of the first things he told me is that without a faith in a supreme being, you basically can't have good morals. What he said demolished this foolish argument. The women at the lodge weren't allowed into the secret meeting, even though they'd been members of the organization since before I was even born; they were working on order of the eastern star so basically they were sitting around doing nothing. I understand it's a fraternal organization, but this all seems like such a waste of time to me and it just doesn't sit right with me the way they treat women; this isn't the future. There's nothing to learn from any of the people here, it's a lot of old men with outdated views and they don't respect you based off of your merits alone if you don't believe in a supreme being. For some reason, they'd like you more if you were a mormon or a scientologist than if you're a really good person with a secular view of reality. 

The people at the lodge were very cordial, too cordial you could argue, some of them were police officers, RN's, and most are ex-military. There's a materialistic side to them which I like. However, I just don't think that they're good people on a deep level. The motto is to make good men better, but what I saw there was men who know they're wasting their time. At this point they HAVE to continue being members because to do otherwise would be awkward. The whole thing just seems so unnecessary.

43,"Already have this posted on r/offmychest  :)

Ever since we (my brothers, sister, &amp; parents) moved to North America from the Middle East in 2016, we left a large chunk of family back there.

During this more home-bound time, I've been thinking about my family.

My aunt &amp; uncle &amp; cousin are visiting and I have never seen my cousin until now. He's 3. I have only seen photos of him as a teeny baby &amp; nothing else. I love him so much, I wonder what it's like to be a mother or a caretaker for children. There's nothing more in this world of material possessions that matters to me like family &amp; being a mother. I can't imagine the pain &amp; hurt one could go through without family.

Anyways, we were just watching a home video and it was of us (the whole family) at a gathering almost 9 years back. That was a long time ago &amp; before we moved to NA. I was about to tear up. I remember the joyousness that they brought. I miss them so much. I wish I got to see them or visit them. I know my brother saw some of them when he went &amp; visited my grandfather &amp; grandmother.

Sometimes I wish that we were still back there with them, seeing them often, being together. It sucks going half a decade without seeing the people you grew up with, the people who were there for you at your best and worst, your support, who are your *family*. It also sucks that the place &amp; position we were in was just the worst for everyone's health, mentally &amp; physically so the move brought much relief.

Please don't think I'm ungrateful, in fact, I'm so grateful to be where I am today. We sacrificed so much to be happier, safer, more stable, &amp; closer as immediate family. I am very privileged to have all these opportunities ahead of me. I am eternally grateful for it.

As I'm growing older, I'm realising that while yeah, you can spend what seems like your entire life with friends &amp; be super close to them, there's nothing better than or closer than family. Looking back, I wish I could say my best friends are the same now as they were then, that they are who I aspire to be, but, I want to be like the people in my family; loving, caring, generous, and kind.

44,"Hi, I had a dicy accident a couple years ago and it has brought up some ptsd after hearing some stories from coworkers the other day.

My radial artery was partially cut, my wrist was cut to the bone by a window from the 50's. Surgeon said he never has seen a cut so deep.

Originally I was stitched up on the outside skin, but not my artery until 2 days later.

I have a couple questions, that frankly, are really hard to answer. I guess I am trying to ease my mind as best as I can.

Firstly, do you think my situation could have potentially led to an amputated thumb (it was a light shade of blue the next morning) if the cut fully severed the artery? Or would the nurse have realized it was fully cut due to the extra bleading and sent me to the better hospital further out from the farm town we were in?

Secondly, how hard is it to fully cut an artery? Did I just get extremely lucky that it was only partially cut?

Looking back this situation was much scarier than I thought due to the fact it happened on christmas eve and we were in a middle of nowhere farm town. The closest hospital to us with trauma surgeons is 45 minutes away.

Some insight into my mental state right now: I worry that I could of died if my artery was fully cut, my father insists he would of tied off a tourniquet for me due to the obviousness of the amount of blood that would of come out. And that the nurse would of gotten an ambulance and prepped the other hospital for my arrival. My parents insist that the medical workers would have been capable of doing the right thing, but the fact I was stitched up in the first place without anyone knowing about my partially cut artery makes me worried and think that they might not have been able to know what to do.

If anyone read this all, what do you think of my situation? Was it pretty dire, or just a bad accident that I got through and not a potentially limb/life threatening event?

I began to wonder if my ears are playing tricks on me again to I take a nice long and hard blink again to clear my thoughts.

I press my eyes firmly shut and open them once again to realize it is just the sticky sound of my water line goo being pulled sport by the opening of my eyes.

49,"He passed away (64) in his home either due to a stroke or a heart attack and wasn’t found until a few days later when the neighbors called the cops to check on him. First off I feel ashamed that it took a few days to even find him (even though he lives alone) and am frustrated I didn’t call him more often. I have been so focused on getting into medical school and being an out of state college student I’ve been more distant these past few years. I’m 21 and my birthday just passed on March 6th. (Unfortunately I didn’t go home to celebrate for spring break and stayed at the university to study for the mcat) I was frustrated that my dad didn’t call me on my birthday and decided to call him towards the end of the day. He forgot and thought it was the day after. Ever since his brain infection (about 10 years ago) and temporal aphasia he had been mentally declining ever since. It got to the point where he didn’t understand most of our conversations and it was difficult to talk about anything because he couldn’t process most of it. Most of our conversations (~5min) that we had revolved around the weather and briefly about other topics. I feel guilty that I got angry with him for not being able to understand what I wanted to tell him or what he was trying to say even though it wasn’t his fault. It hurt me to see how smart he once was considering he got a PHD and ended up mentally declining so much.

My parents divorced when I was young (11) and as the years passed I visited him less and less. We had a rocky relationship for awhile and the divorce and it’s complications kept me distant from him. Pretty much my entire teenage years and part of college I would on occasion call my dad or visit him. (I was also frustrated that most of the time I would have to call him and he wouldn’t really call me. I also feel guilty that there were times where I would ignore some of his calls because I was mad at him for some of the unreasonable decisions he made- part of which I attribute to his mental decline). 
 
Recently, (past few years in college) whenever I would visit or call him or FaceTime him I could tell how happy he got to see me. Since I realized I couldn’t develop a stronger relationship with my father most of the time these conversations felt like autopilot (I feel guilty for this too because I got to a point where I gave up since our conversations couldn’t get deeper). I still made the intention to call him for a few minutes and whenever I came home for break to visit him-even if it was for just an hour, but am frustrated I didn’t do it more often. I did try to stay for as long as I could and make time for him but found myself busy with all my academics throughout this time- making me wish I sent more time aside for him considering I barely got to see him unless it was during breaks. 

The last few months of his life were dark and he told me how depressed he got and wanted to just die. Hearing him talk like this devastated me. I tried to give him ways to stay busy and not do nothing all day like do yoga (and send beginner YouTube yoga videos) or volunteer, or go for a walk - but he either didn’t understand or just gave up. As his son I feel embarrassed I couldn’t change his life around. He was also in a financial struggle and couldn’t hold a job anymore and was eventually going to lose his house and would have to sell it. I loved him and wanted to help but felt so powerless. He told me he wanted to pay off and give my brother and I his house and just die. 

Looking back I now realize how sick he got and I think he knew he was dying and maybe was trying to tell me- but I just didn’t want to accept it and wasn’t sure if it was the truth because of his mental state.

2 days after my birthday ( a few days before he died) I decided to call him again. I’m not sure why I randomly thought of him but I’m glad I did. We FaceTime’d and had a brief conversation (about the weather and a few other things) he was really happy. My mom also talked to him, my brother, and his sister talked to him over those past few days as well. My mom told me how much happier he seemed since the last time she saw him (a week prior and many years before that). I’m glad I was able to talk to him and make him smile. I’ll never forget how happy he was to see me whenever I called or visited. My mom tells me how this was our final way of saying goodbye to him (considering he hadn’t talked to any of them for months or years and suddenly did those last few days).

Sorry about the long story just trying to process my feelings. A brief summary would be: my father died unexpectedly and I never got to say my final goodbye, I’m not sure how to cope with this time of loss and grief and would appreciate any advice or experience. In addition, I feel frustrated that I couldn’t develop a closer relationship because of the divorce and his mental decline over the years. He gave up a lot for me and emigrated to the USA just for a family life and left behind his university- and am mad that I didn’t realize how much he sacrificed until now. I’m mad of what could have been. I also feel guilty for not calling him more often and being so preoccupied in my studies.

He sent me a text after my birthday: “I love you my son This is what remains in me! Love you Alex.” 

I just hope he knows how much I loved him too. I have trouble sleeping and keep crying and don’t know what to do.",19Mar2020,1

51,"Just to start these two are perilouswolf and honeywhaale on Instagram in case anyone would like to spread the word. They are both furry artists who are taking advantage of young children.

Tried urging three victims to tell someone who can do something or report it to an anonymous tip service but they were too nervous.

These two furries are finding kids, people of color and dming them calling them several racial slurs and threatening them. They are also doing children who follow them and asking for nudes, sending nudes, sexually roleplaying with children, adding children into sexual role play groups, sending porn (including furry porn and zoophilia), claiming they rape animals, telling kids they want to rape them, triggering rape victims on purpose, and much much more. 

Their (innocent and easily manipulated) child fan base is continuing to give them money and supporting them. I am very concerned about these children, I don’t have the screenshots of all of what they said due to the victims leaving social media. Please please share this is you can, I literally made his throwaway to vent about this because I’m so fucking pissed.",19Mar2020,1
53,"For the past few years, my friends are always too busy. Too busy to even call me. I don’t get it! I just don’t understand... :(

I don’t make friends easy because I’m picky about who I hang out with. I’ll be anyone’s friend, whether they need one or not. I’ll talk to anyone, goof around with anyone, I smile at everyone and try to make people happy because I just don’t like when people are sad. I just don’t make good friends easy. People never invite me to things.

I think I’m too innocent. I’m a Senior in Highschool, but I don’t drink or do any drugs. I am chill with other people doing it, especially weed is cool with me. I don’t like people drinking around me though because my dad is a drunk and I just can’t handle drunk people. The thing is, pretty much all my friends are innocent too. Only about half aren’t. I have friends, they just don’t seem to really want to hang out with me.

I just don’t get it. I just want to make people happy, that’s my one goal in life. I’ll sit for hours listening to your problems, and hug you when you need it, I will give you advice if you ask for it, and I’ll do that for strangers if they need it too. If I see something someone I know might like, I’ll get it for them. (If it’s cheap I’ll get it for someone I don’t know too well, but more expensive I’ll buy it for a friend obviously) I don’t pander to people though. I am who I am and I’m not ashamed of it. I dress vintage, and I am extremely obsessed with the 60’s/70’s and everything vintage. It just makes me really happy. It makes me happy to dress up every day. (It never looks like a costume, it’s realistic or real vintage.) I can’t imagine that’s the reason why. 

I don’t shoot down anyone else’s interests, I encourage people in anything they love. I am a huge advocate for following your dreams, no matter how foolish people think they are.

I am really young at heart and I am very energetic, but I’ll chill out if they seem overwhelmed. I never push my problems on anyone. I don’t come with baggage that you have to help me carry. I don’t hold grudges, it’s impossible for me, I can’t help but forgive people. (I’m not kidding, I’ve tried to hold a grudge on my dad after a particularly bad night, but I had to say good morning to him because I felt bad not saying it, even though he was a jerk the night before.) No one knows any of my real big problems. I’m not perfect, and they know that. I talk about problems, but not any that would give them a need to feel like they need to help me carry it.

I know people like me, but it’s just that I don’t know why my friends are always too busy for me, then post videos of them with their friends online. One of my friends, I asked her to be honest, if she was embarrassed by me or something, and she genuinely didn’t realize that she was neglecting hanging out with me ever. She is genuinely busy. She isn’t the problem. But I don’t know. It’s just, I do my best to make my friends lives happier and easier, not even just my friends, I just like making people happy. Im not a pushover, or give people whatever they want, it’s not like that. I don’t know how to explain it. 

I’m not saying I’m great, not even a bit. I’m pretty untalented, not very pretty, a bit too innocent maybe, and maybe a bit too happy. I’m just doing my best, and what feels right in my heart, but I’m still not good enough for people. 

TLDR: All I want in life is to make people happy. I’m not a pushover, but I’m still doing my best. I’m not talented, or pretty, maybe I’m a bit too innocent or maybe I’m too happy. I just don’t see why any of those are reasons that everyone is always too busy for me. I just want someone to call me, or invite me out, without me asking them. Even when I do ask them, they are usually too busy to even call me. Then I see posts of them hanging with friends. Am I really that embarrassing? I get along with virtually anyone...",19Mar2020,1

We have been together for awhile and he has NEVER acted like this before or wanted me to not text him at ALL. He missed our anniversary because he was “too busy” probably playing video games with them or something. He freaked out at me tonight all because I asked him why he was staying longer, because I’m kind of worried he doesn’t want me as much anymore but he doesn’t understand how the situation freaks me out. I tried talking to him about it tonight and it’s like 12 am for him and he said he’s busy right now talking to friends (aka the girls). He doesn’t say good morning or goodnight or I love you or anything for the past week which is also something he has NEVER done before. When he would be busy he would say that and say I love you or something like that but instead I get “stop worrying” and “leave me alone I want to enjoy myself” in context that makes me feel like he isn’t happy with me anymore or I’m just a responsibility not a relationship... someone please help..

57,"  

She recommended a list of movies for me to watch. I always looked forward to our conversations, no matter how brief they may be. I loved her intelligence and the way she spoke about the world. Her words transcended the universe that makes you want to dive into the deep with her. She had that effect on me, just like how her presence made me say YES to everything. I watched her movies, listened to her songs, gave her words a place to stay as if they’re familiar visitors. 

One might think I spend so much time with a person I was drawn to but time wasn’t kind to me. We sometimes talked once in a week or even once in a month. In fact, we talked more before wherein we had conversations that made me stay up all night and check my phone once in a while just to read her message again. It made me crave for more words, words that I only wished to gain but cannot have. Thanks to my fearful nature, I also anticipated for the worst. 

In the middle of the wonderful whirlwind I shared with her, I had a few tearful nights. Question marks lined up in my head like soldiers endlessly marching. Please believe when I say that our set-up looks the usual but I felt lost at times, felt like hanging by a thread for a connection that I still think wasn’t there. I was in her life but if you’d look at it through the structure of a house, I was only allowed in the balcony and I respect that, even if I wished to even just enter the living room, see the things that make her awake in the middle of the night or hold her when sadness envelops her.

If you’d ask me in terms of my feelings, I never thought of it and maybe never will. I’m one of the “lucky ones” who’s a part of all things complicated, tangled, and cumbersome. 

I wrote her letters I’d probably never send…but those were meant as farewell letters. I slowly removed the songs she told me to listen to in my playlist, I shifted my genre in movies to those far away from hers, I stopped sending messages, I stopped the normal things I do so I can slowly transition into a life that doesn’t have any of her marks. But I still find myself listening to a song that makes me think of her…I still remember her in places we used to go to.. I find her in one my lipstick shades, in a particular scent I smell, and in daily activities to do not even remind me of her. 

I needed these words to come out of my struggling self after almost four years. She might never know but that’s okay. It’s gonna be okay real soon.",19Mar2020,1

60,"We met off Tinder and have been exclusively seeing each other for the past 3 weeks. I realize it’s been such a short time but feels long because we have already spent 8 full days together. 

When I met him the first time, I thought it would just be a one night stand. However, we had such amazing chemistry and the next day, he asked when he could see me again. We established we were only seeing each other and that we were both open to a potential relationship if it led there. We continued to meet up. Every time we hung out, before the end of the date, he would always plan in advance the next time we would see each other, whether it was a few days or a week later. I’ve initiated once; every other time, he has initiated. 

Our days together are comprised of more than just sex, cuddling, Netflix and eating. By the second week, he had invited me to his hockey game and I met his brothers, and I also met his friends on another day. And for the first time, this past weekend, I spent the whole weekend with him (per his request). I slept over at his place for 2 evenings, and we spent all day Sunday with his brothers playing airsoft, eating dinner, hanging out, etc. His brothers and friends were all super fun, nice and welcoming to me, playing around, making jokes and all. I felt very accepted, almost like one of the bros. In front of them, the guy I’m seeing was also very physically affectionate towards me (holding waist, holding hands, kisses, playful sexual touches, etc.) even in public . 

By the end of the weekend, when it was time for me to go home, I noticed he didn’t initiate the next time we would see each other again, which he always does. I brushed it off and figured since we just spent the entire weekend together, I could chill. The weekend was great btw, and I made sure to be considerate staying over (I helped him clean, did dishes, didn’t make a mess, etc) 

We did text a bit afterwards and he basically said we will meet again soon, and he said it felt “weird” being alone (after we spent the weekend together). He still hasn’t given me a definitive date and time when we would hang out again... which is unusual! 

TLDR: I’ve been exclusively seeing a guy for the past 3 weeks . He has already introduced me to his brothers and friends. Every time we hang out, before the end of the date, he ALWAYS plans the next time we’re gonna see each other. After spending an entire weekend with him for the first time, he didn’t initiate to see me again yet... should I be concerned here, or am I overthinking?",19Mar2020,1

Sixth-grade music class in Littletown, Massachusetts in 1966 was a weekly affair. On Tuesdays the music teacher, Miss Letitia Olmaide, would visit the five sixth-grade classrooms of the third through sixth-grade student population. The school was named after the hill it was built on. The assemblage inside the square, one story red-brick, flat-roofed building named the Bearslap Elementary school was one hundred per cent white. Teachers, administrators, students, lunch staff, everyone. This was true for all three schools in town, and would not change for a couple more years, when the Metco busing program brought African-American students to Littletown High School was introduced.
The building's plain, square design formed the courtyard. It was bound by four corridors and classrooms built of yellow glazed ceramic brick walls topped by painted cinderblocks. A high-gloss floor finish laid down on the rust-flecked tan tiles reflected the recessed lights in the acoustic ceilings. The grassy courtyard could be seen through the one-by-three-foot tilt-out windows along the corridors and in the classrooms, The courtyard had only one use. Growing and mowing four-inch-tall Kentucky bluegrass. The playgrounds and school were sheltered on the north and west sides by a thick stand of maple, elm, and oak, all tucked into a hollow on the south side of a small drumlin. The drumlin formed on the west side of town, courtesy of the last glacier to vacation on Cape Porpoise, Cape Ann, and Cape Cod, about fourteen thousand years ago. 
Bearslap Hill, local legend held, had once seen an epic battle between two enormous black bears. The hill itself is steep, much of it at a forty-percent grade. Both bears in the fight were heathy, about eight feet tall. Obeying the Territorial Imperative and fighting for primacy, neither bear noticed, as they bit and clawed and roared at each other during the battle, that they had fought their way to the crest of a quarter-mile-long grassy slope. The steep incline was dotted with patches of low scrub as well as mature Oak and Pine trees, Both bears at the same time had reared up on their back legs, cursing bear-curses at each other, Then, the slightly bigger bear, with his right paw uphill, reared back, swiveled his entire upper body back and around and, POW!, gave his ursine adversary a ferocious paw to the side of the head.  The other bear's head snapped to the right as he instantly went limp. But the momentum from the head-slap twisted him face-first, onto the grassy grade, where his big, black bear belly bounced once on the steep slope, and then, because of the incline and knocked-out bear's rather rubbery demeanor at the time, his bottom came up and over his head. Then all of him started rolling downhill. The bear quickly picked up momentum, his still-unconscious form now sort of ""gallumphing"" on down the incline, tumbling and flipping end-over-end like fuzzy black water sausage.
 As Rolling Bear began to regain consciousness, he realized something was wrong. The large, rotten Bass he had eaten on the riverbank for breakfast hadn't settled right. The defeated, and currently gravity-challenged eight-hundred pound bear was about to learn, as breakfast rapidly came back up the way it entered, that things can always get worse. The bear's throat and mouth were now, unfortunately for him, doing forty-five RPM down the side of a drumlin.
The belabored bruin was regaining consciousness as he was rolling and tumbling, all four legs akimbo, mouth and nose spewing liquified fresh-water Bass in big arcs overhead as he continued rapidly downhill, black-bear-bottom over crow's nest, narrowly missing a half-dozen collisions with the trunks of tall oak and pine. Rolling Bear travelled like that about a hundred yards down the hill, until finally his backside fetched up against a tall, middle-aged white pine trunk. This collision sent a ""shiver"" up the living pine that dislodged several dozen pine cones from their perches, dangling below heavy clusters of pine needles on branches fifty to one hundred feet up. Two to three seconds later, the barrage of pine cones landed, bouncing off of and around the hapless bear, with the pine sap making some of them stick to his fur. But pine cones can't hurt a bear. Not even a knocked-out, rolled-down-the-hill-spew-a-bass-and-hit-a-tree bear.
Local legend here falls silent. But the name, and the story it tells, is forever enshrined by the foot and a half tall bronze of two erect bears, one slapping the other on the side of the head. It stands, in its unique ursine glory, atop the red brick pedestal rising above its round-faced concrete plinth. The mini-monument is situated just to the right of  the flat-roofed portico which leads to the four heavy, tri-windowed turquioise front doors of Bearslap Elementary school in Littletown, Massachusetts, USA.
Miss Olmeade drove her nineteen-sixty, two-door, two-tone Rambler American past the slapping-bear bronze every  morning at seven forty-five sharp, continuing into the ""Reserved For Visiting Teachers"" spot nearest the front entrance. The round-edged little car had single headlights, a mesh grille, a white roof, bronze-brown-colored body and a fiberglass spare tire carrier that stood upright on the extended rear bumper. It looked like a tiny, two-door limousine. 
She would get out, all five feet, two inches of her in her flats  and walk toward the entrance in the early-Spring sunshine, sand thrown down weeks ago on the ice now crunching under the heels of her sensible dark-brown shoes. The music teacher walked past the slapping bear bronze, pulling open the heavy turquoise door with the three square panes of wire-mesh glass, She slowed her stride inside the building, turning slightly to her left to  check the state of her graying brown hair in her reflection in the glass display case in the lobby. It was fire safety week inside the display case. Miss Olmeade wore no make up, no lipstick. Satisfied that she looked sufficiently severe in her brown shawl, white collarless shirt and calf-length tan skirt, she turned right and walked down the main hallway toward the third-grade classrooms.  On Tuesdays, the older kids got to sing as we read the lyrics from a music textbook printed sometime in the early nineteen-fifties, the height of Jim Crow in the Southern United States.

 Miss Olmeade would hand-pick four volunteers from each sixth-grade class during the day to roll her unlockable upright piano from its rather awkward home, in the gym, back to the classroom. After running around the edge of the basketball floor, the kids would peel back the four layers of large pastel-blue, pale sea-green, and bone-white and gray  packing blankets which protected it from damaged by errant volley- and basketballs. The instrument could no longer be stored  in the large area behind the double doors of the Janitor's closet. No one in the building wanted to hear ""Chopsticks"" played wrong six or eight times a day ever again, 
Every week in gym class, I saw the packing-blanket piano, But  I was never selected to retrieve it for music class. I didn't know why. Maybe they could tell I was one of the kids who would want to see how fast we could get 'er going down the nice, level hallways. 
Two other kids were entrusted with the key to the supply closet. The students were always sent in pairs. I  suspected it was to keep us from, singly, unsupervised like that, taking over the school and declaring permanent recess.
The supply closet was where the music book cart lived, along with spare tables, chairs, desks, and racks of books, Some of the books were outdated, just judging by the wear on the spines. Some of the social studies textbooks spoke of the forty-eight states of America.

The sheet-metal construction rolling cart had been ordered in prison gray. It had a top tray and a lower tray, about thirty inches long by twenty inches wide. The music books stood up in rows on the cart, which was less than three feet tall. The chosen two would bulldog the top-heavy cart down the hallways to the classroom. The selected kids would hand out the books to the seated students.They would give the books that were in good shape to their friends, and the beat-up copies to the kids they didn't like. These music books reproduced, in miniature, the actual sheet music for each song. This was done so it could be used in flutophone class, where the third-grade players could read music. Not like here in the sixth grade, where we just sang along to Miss Olmeade's piano playing. If the government had sent classrooms of flutophoning third-graders to the front lines in France and Belgium in 1916, the war would have been over in days. German troops would have surrendered in tears, begging for mercy, as their memory of the music of Wagner, Bach and Ludwig Van Beethoven would be crushed by the squealing of plastic-tinged notes. Their sanity would have fled after mere hours of the noodling, whistling, hooting, squeaking, and piping that comes, without mercy, from these ""instruments"".
I couldn't read music yet, But I could read the lyrics in the elementary-level music book. And here, my eyes found a word they hadn't read before in Stephen Foster's maudlin American Slavery-Era song, ""The Old Folks At Home"", The way Mr.Assibbie had the desks in the room spaced in their rows left only one place for the piano in the classroom. And that put the piano player facing the wall, not the class.
Miss. Olmeade instructed us to turn to page thirty-seven in our music books, then turned back to the piano. She led the singing while she worked her way mechanically through the uneven melody of the thoroughly boring song.  As I was listening to it, I felt it must  be from some strange foreign land. If this was supposed to be an American Classic, you could keep it. But she kept banging along, and came at last to the confounding lyric: ""Oh, darkies how my heart is yearning, far from the old folks at home..."".As the tune brought the word ""darkies"" up to be sung, Miss. Olmaide twisted her upper body around in an attempt to get the class' attention, looking like like a trained seal without a beach ball. Still pounding on the keyboard, she raised her voice to sing at us  the words ""Oh, brothers"" over  the words "" Oh, darkies"". And then the song mercifully ended.
 I could feel my face scrunching up as two questions occurred to me simlultaneously. One, why did Ms. Olmeade get weird and  loud over that word?  And two, what the heck  are ""darkies""? I had absolutely no idea.
At twelve years of age in sixth grade, I knew I was no dummy. I had been raised to be color-blind. I had never been given any reason to feel I was in any way, better than anyone else. Smarter, maybe, But that doesn't mean automatically better. I could see good in everyone, and I could see both sides of arguments. Bob had always indicated what he valued by his choices His friends, His choice of words, his chosen profession. He valued integrity. He valued personal honor. He valued reason. He valued honesty and intelligence. He valued courage in all its forms. He valued good company. He valued an active sense of humor. At no point in my youth was it ever even insinuated by my brilliant father that one color or language or backstory was superior in and of itself.
 On the coffee table at home were copies of ""Ebony"" magazine with people like Jim Brown and Thurgood Marshall on the cover. Bob subscribed because he wanted his son to be accustomed to seeing black faces. Especially since we lived in this town that was white as Hell. Oh, you don't think Hell is white? Imagine a world where EVERYTHING is white. Elephants. Houses, Washes. Water. Caps. Horses. Lies. Lightning. Noise. Knights. Walls. Papers. Plains. Whales. Shoes. Collars. Lines. Socks.Outs. Hats. 
So here I sat in music class, completely baffled because I've never heard the word ""darkies"" before. In slavery-era music, or otherwise. There may have been artwork on the pages of our music textbook. Maybe some faux- ""Currier and Ives""- style representations of ""darkies"". If there were, they were meaningless to me, and I don't remember them. I had heard, vaguely, of the American Slavery Era, but did not yet know it started pretty much as soon as the white man landed in America. And I most assuredly did not know what was meant by ""darkies"". My response to this denial-by-naming at the time would have been the same as it is now. ""Well then, if they're the ""darkies"" why aren't people that look like me called ""lighties""?"" It's equally dumb-sounding, so why not?
By the time Dr. King's made his""I have a Dream"" speech from the nation's Capitol, I had already learned, in matters both great and small, the content of  a person's character was what really mattered. 
In that music class, I puzzled out for myself that the singer in ""The Old Folks At Home"" was singing to...someone, but I couldn't define who or what ""darkies"" were. My mind ranged for possible answers to this peculiar question. I tried homophones. ""Hmm, Doggies?"" No.  ""Oh, Donkeys?"" No. ""Oh, Dockies?"" Perhaps. But I hadn't actually visited Flushing, Long Island, yet, so, no. 
I just couldn't figure out what the heck, or who  the heck Foster had his protagonist singing to.
But I did manage to intuit, by virtue of watching Miss Olmeade nearly break herself in half to sing a different word over  that word, that questions about  the word were not encouraged. For the moment, I was blocked from finding out what ""darkies"" really meant. And being a  twelve-year-old boy, I would probably forget the matter upon standing up.",19Mar2020,1

(Southern culture dictates that it’s less physical labor which is frustrating, but at least I got them in the tech department) they’re tough folks both being cancer survivors, my grandpa dealing with early stages of dementia, and has had Diabetes for the past 10 years now. I also have health problems so this a good setup for us to help one another. 
Cue Corona.
My grandparents and my mother and her husband do not take it seriously at all. And in the beginning stages I was sort of in the same camp. (The toilet paper thing was a pain.) however, the more I’ve heard and read, the more it seems wise to to be cautious. We’re all in that fabulous bracket that Corona does the most damage to. So extra diligence on hand washing and sanitizer, getting some extra foodstuffs and essentials, skipping super crowded places, you know the drill.
But then things started shutting down and the order against gatherings of 10 or more. Okay, time to be more serious about not going out and being near sick people. Lol, nope!
My oldest brother (32) no longer has work and all his college is online so in his infinite wisdom, has decided he wants to come here to visit. Dumbass had the flu last week! 
Oh, but if he’s coming over here then this is the perfect opportunity for my mom, her husband, and two youngest kids (14 and 12) to come as well! 
I mean, we’re under 10 people, sure! But my cousin babysits their sister (10) who’s for sure gonna want to be here if my sisters are (and their mother has to work and doesn’t leave the kiddo with anyone else)
And nobody but me and my cousin sees a problem. (Well my married sister (25) does, but she and her hubs are self isolating) 
If I bring this up then I’m a buzzkill asshole Chicken Little, buying into mass hysteria. I mean they’re not social distancing at all, and they’re all fine! (Our neighbors who are in similar boats of age and health issues popped by to visit, and my grandparents were just pleased as punch)
I get that this isn’t easy for most anyone right now. Being alone sucks, being stuck in your own home/yard is hard. Not living your normal day to day is rough. But I feel like this is irresponsible. And while I don’t expect much from my mother ever (she’d also encourage this just to spite me because my Bisexual Pagan ass) I did expect more from my brother Who I would normally consider as someone with his head on his shoulders.",19Mar2020,1

74,"It started with her stocking up on way too much stuff, and she'll probably never use most of it. For example, she has a small older dog but bought three large bags of dog food. 

Then, when they started encouraging people to stay home, she kept going everywhere. Church, library, group meetings, regular doctor's appointments, etc. 

Finally, today, she said she needed me to drive her to the hospital for slight shortness of breath and cold hands. She had just walked to a store (to ask them about buying vegetable seeds for her to grow ""in case things get bad""), and she already has a know issue that causes shortness of breath. She was still able to talk without sounding out of breath or anything. She said she would be going to the one clinic that _everyone with respirator problems are being sent to_ right now. So she was going to go expose herself to anyone who has symptoms of coronavirus and take up space in a healthcare system that's already overworked, for something that even she admitted wasn't urgent. 

Under normal circumstances it would have been fine to go in for that. But considering what's going on, and the fact that she's in an at-risk group, I decided to try to convince her to wait a few weeks. Luckily she agreed with my logic and she started feeling better. But it's so frustrating to watch her just do the exact opposite of everything we're supposed to be doing.",19Mar2020,1
75,"I know this is anecdotal, but it's also interesting to me. I'm 24, and so far my experience has been:

My friends canceled DnD.

My younger brother and sister both decided not to hang out with me or their friends while school is out.

Just about every car I see driving around or every person that seems to be walking around without purpose is somebody over 50.

Older folks (50-60s range) lined up pretty much shoulder to shoulder at the drug store  while myself and one other younger person spaced wayyy out behind them. 


Like I said, anecdotal and not necessarily indicative of an overall trend, it's just weird to me when they're the ones more endangered by it. Every time I see a post or hear somebody talking about having to convince the younger generations that this is a big deal I just laugh to myself a bit.",19Mar2020,1
76,"Has anyone else found themselves falling in this hole of feeling useless and lame?

I've been laid off for 2 weeks, probably even a month. I'm a student living in my boyfriend's apartment. I have no way to pay rent now or collect money to transfer to a new college. My paycheck will be around 50$ this month. Thankfully, his aunt owns this entire house we live in, but I still feel bad. 

I'm starting to feel this Corona bullshit will impact us more than we think. Mentally, economically... Especially afterwards. My country depends on tourism and now the summer season will be in ruins and everything will be postponed.

It's hard not to feel depressed. My boyfriend is the only thing keeping me afloat from becoming a depressed mess. Not to mention, I'm supposed to study for exams which will determine if I can transfer to a new college. I can't bring myself to study in this state.

78,"I work in an office 8-5ish 4.5 days a week. Love my job and the people there but I'm quite socially anxious and err on the side of not being completely socially engaged. I love it when the opportunity to go for an after work pint - childcare permitting - but don't want to get involved much more than that. Want to emphasise that I do love and care for these people, I'm lucky to work where I do. It's going to suck working from home.

Outside of work I live with my wife and 3 year-old in a pretty small flat in a city. We have a tiny group of friends who are mostly other parents met through child related things. These guys are great but we see them maybe once or twice a week. Besides when we very rarely get a childminder so we can go out for dinner, or when I go to the store, that is the extent of my real world social interaction.

I don't interact much with social media. It makes me anxious, but I do read and occasionally post to Reddit and very very occasionally Twitter. I do however listen to a lot of podcasts that tend to have a more free flowing vibe. Now that I think about it, it fills a bit of a social need but not in an ""I follow them on Instagram/twitter"" kind of way.

Because of the pandemic, a lot of the hosts of the podcasts are starting to (rightfully so) self-isolate or make great efforts to socially distance themselves. Naturally this takes up a bunch of their conversations to the point where one show are doing call-ins everyday on twitch and several others are having ""check-in"" shows. It sucks that they are having to adjust like this and I totally love these episodes. It's fascinating hearing what is going on around the world right now too.

It is making me want to interact more in constructive ways. I've enthusiastically joined a WhatsApp group one of our stairwell neighbours started to help organise help for if/when things get worse and it's been great to finally know who any of these people are; though only through an app so far. There are something like 15 other flats in this building and I've only known the names of our 1 immediate neighbour. I don't want to speculate on what's going to happen but I do hope I can adjust into being more socially open through this though it's a little paradoxical.

81,"I don't advocate codependency either. Far from it.

But a strong, single lady can die of thirst, of hunger, of illness, from injuries, if she's too hot or too cold. People need people. And I need more people than most people. Maybe that's just being a hoe bag, but a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.

I actually go by the 'emotional wheel' approach to dating. Just like a vocal range, everybody has a feelings range: some people can hit the mood, others are feeling-deaf. So rather than be limited to one person’s emotional capabilities I have a pick'n'mix of people, including: 

Mr. Good Time – a hedonist with a good dealer.

Mr. Shit-hit-the-fan – a nihilist with no shred of hope for better days for the human race in general, and for himself in particular, but a great listener nonetheless.  

When I’m feeling low in energy I tend to seek out Ms. Blue and wade in the muddy rivers of life with her. However, I only see Ms. Blue when her life is full of other projects – ra-ra activist projects – because otherwise, if she’s feeling high energy, I myself become the project (learned that the hard way).

Then there’s my high arousal guy, Mr. Pre-incarceration. I generally see him after 23:00. I chose this nickname for him because I’m pretty sure he'll soon be behind bars - it makes sense, the majority of people in prison are/were high energy and obsessed with the next big thing. Each night with Mr. Pre-incarceration pushes my boundaries, and maybe I just hope he goes to jail before I end up in A&amp;E with some random object stuck up my arse and/or knife fight wounds.  

And then there are a lot of guest appearances (or one-time appearances):

Miss My-parents-are-loaded-&amp;-all-I-do-is-watch-the-Simpsons,  
 Mr. Professional poker player,  
 Mr. DMT-too-much,  
 Dr. Know nothing,  
 Mr. I-talk-about-guitar-more-than-play-it,  
 Ms. White-Saviour complex,  
 Mr. Paranoid investigative reporter,

84,"It has been proven for decades that white blood cells (which do not have types like A, B, or O - that's specifically erythrocytes - white blood cells have groups as well, but they're present in everyone) fight infections such as COVID-19.

The sample size was small, there is evidence the figures have been exaggerated, and all reputable science has dismissed the idea that red blood cells fight infection. Your blood type has nothing to do with how you respond to a virus - that's the white blood cell's job. You are no more likely to die from COVID-19 whether you're type O, AB, or A as all your ''blood type'' is is proteins on the surface of your red blood cells. The only basis this has on anything is blood transfusions, not infections (which again, are handled by the white blood cells - the red blood cell's job is to transport oxygen.)

It's disinformation such as this that is causing more harm than good, and I wish the Daily Mail in particular would stop milking the anxiety. It's akin to saying that people with dry skin are more likely to succumb to asthma because the skin breathes, when it's been proven long ago that our lungs breathe, not our skin.


I'll add some ***flaws I found in the original study;***

1. Was not peer reviewed

2. Was not genuinely followed up on

3. We don't know anything about the infected population. There could be thousands out there that are infected but with such mild symptoms they never present to authorities and are never tested. We have no way to account and so any data set is incomplete and it is dishonest to draw any conclusions based off a partial data set

4. The most important one, the observation wasn't even really statistically significant. It didnt take into account regional variances (some blood types are more common in different regions, especially in the Mediterranean region) or, of course, the utterly incomplete data set

5. There is a plethora of science spanning decades that show that red blood cells are useless in fighting infection - red cells don't even have the organelles or biochemistry to destroy pathogens, and even if they did, blood type just refers to proteins and sugars found on the red cell's surface; it does not affect the function of the red cells themselves.",19Mar2020,1
85,"I'm definitely the type of person to avoid things that may result in my feelings getting hurt. 

I keep saying that I don't want to like anyone (romantically)  bc I'm in high school and it rarely ever lasts, and is almost never real/meaningful. I used to be the kind of girl who never ever wanted to be in a serious relationship, and only wanted small flings and such. But now I've realized that that's not true, I do want a relationship, but  with someone who truly understands me, and respects my outlook on life, etc. What I mean by this is like someone who cares about the things that truly matter. I need someone to understand that I have accepted the fact that I will die one day, and I don't want to live my life the way society says I should, I don't need a university degree (although I actually want one), I don't need to get a boring secure job, I don't need to get married and have kids, I just want to do whatever I want to do ya know?

I'm not sure if I'll ever find anyone who fits that category, but it is what it is. I've recently come to terms with the fact that I may be developing feelings for a boy. But I can't accept it. I know for a fact that he's kinda an asshole, and all we do is fight, but is it because he likes me? We have amazing chemistry and I feel as if he and I have the potential make each other's lives more enjoyable. The thing is I don't know if I actually like him or if I just want him because he's different from all the guys I know. He doesn't completely see things the way I do but he does more than others, and that's completely ok because I understand that people have different philosophies and shit, but I'm not sure if he's looking for the same things I am.  I don't want to tell any of my friends this because I know for a fact that they do not have the same outlook/ideology as me.

But really, human culture is hard to understand.

I will go with my first question please.

Why cannot I fist bump humans of African American. I met a nurse once with the humans who look after me. She was nice and pretty and cool. We were leaving and she started commencing the shaking of hands but, I do not like to be touched. I have seen fist bumps and figured they were quick and there would be much less touching which I preferred. So I went for it. Besides that, I'm not someone worst a hand shack, please pretend I'm just in the background.

This is the wrong answer though?

The nurse got a little angry and said she was too old for that while my main looker after laughed so hard in the elevator she almost peed.

I don't know why that wasn't good? I'm confused on what I did wrong.

My looker afters said to just never go with a fist bump for anyone but especially African Americans but....why? I'll obviously not do it again but I wish to understand this.

I’m 20 now, and I just want something slow honestly. I’m thinking of just going to college, but the only thing I can think of to go for is just upgrading. Sure I have passions and hobbies... gosh, I have a lot. But it’s the jack of all trades-master of none effect. I think growing up I always wanted to do everything, and because of that, I’m no longer happy with the idea of doing just one or only a few things. (Especially if I might not enjoy them)

So not only was it kind of hard then, now it’s like “oh great I’m heavily advised to never leave my house, not like much has changed anyway”

I don’t really have friends or “networking connections” so that blows. It’s weird times. I know I know the typical response “you’re actually really young”.

Text Below:

The mystical experiences that connect us to our environment have been cloistered into religious institutions. The priest swings incense, and the Buddhists use their traditional Ohm vocal melody.

These images are familiar and remind us that sacred spaces are practically proprietary and for only the selected divine.

Well, no longer. A new digital method offers anyone free access to finding liminal space. At a time when everyone is urged to seclude themselves from Coronavirus, I went exploring - albeit alone. I tried Randonauting, it moved me on a deep level, and this is a report of my first try.

When facing the unknown, ask the unknown

Randonauting [is a growing Internet subculture](https://www.reddit.com/r/randonauts/) that is summoning people to explore their environments in new, more mindful ways, and pick up trash at the same time. There's a [great beginner's guide](https://medium.com/@TheAndromedus/a-beginners-guide-to-randonauting-1dd505c3c5a9), which I am not going to repeat.

Here's the brief:

Sparked by a blend of scientific reasoning and spirituality, the simple idea behind Randonauting is to venture outside of the predictable places we visit every day. [The Fantom-bot](https://bot.randonauts.com/), a Telegram chat channel, finds a position within a radius of your location based on quantum randomness. It invites you to travel to places outside of your usual spots. [Thousands of people are doing it](https://medium.com/@TheAndromedus/the-incredible-synchronicity-of-a-randonaut-adventure-215731c00fa3), and having insightful experiences are contagious.

I recently settled in Westport Ireland to be equidistant from friends and family and ground myself in a new community. So, I booted up the Telegram app and messaged the bot to receive a random location within walking distance (\~1000 meters) and awaited its response while marinating in my intention: ""home."" They now have a proper application, so it is easier than ever.

The point was just off the narrow country road about a 30-minute walk. It dropped only within the property of a gated house. No, I didn't investigate the premises without consent. In fact, I didn't have to.

As I approached the red pin on my phone, a white work van for a local wood-flooring company barreled through the gate and caught me off guard. Aware, or paranoid, that I looked a bit suspicious, I kept walking but noticed a number sequence on their license plate: 222. Numerologists will know the more [specific spiritual significance](https://www.sunsigns.org/angel-number-222-meaning/) of such a number, but, for me, it reminded me to take note of my surroundings and find the beauty of that moment.

The repeating numbers were synchronicity that spread a smile upon my face, but it got weirder. Surrounding the house were identically shaped ornamental trees - topiaries. I counted them quickly along the perimeter as I waved nervously to the man exiting the truck.

I counted 27 - my age.

Sure, an oddly specific number of decorative trees, but they didn't burst into flames at my arrival. So, maybe not divine...but possibly.

The Fantom-Bot directed me to a spot just inside the fence and through a narrow gap in the stone wall that is quite familiar to Irish properties. Usually, these gaps are large enough for a human to enter and shelter sacred spaces from roaming livestock.

A narrow dirt path led to a tree stump with a small mail slot attached to it. Big enough to fit a large envelope but not a bulky package. This mailbox about ankle height above the ground made my belly buckle with laughter as I walked away from the house. It wasn't the primary letterbox of the home. So the questions remained:

What the hell is a mailbox doing attached to a tree stump at the random point found spit out by my phone?

Better still, why am I not knee-deep in a bog or making odd eye-contact with the sheep or cows in a random, meaningless field?

Not the case. Instead, mysteriously, a random geo-locater placed me next to a mailbox attached to a tree trunk in a country of sacred stone circles and fairies.

Odd, to say the least.

Sadly I didn't take any pictures because I didn't want to invade the privacy of the homeowner.

Finding beauty in the ordinary

As other Randonauters report, this new method of divination leads to more questions than answers. But that's life. My simple afternoon walk turned into an adventure, and I found something unexplainably special that felt heart-centered and meaningful.

Walking back from the anomaly point, I felt a renewed sense of inspiration and awe at my collective surroundings. The two crows sitting in a tree, making eyes at me, struck me as friendly and meaningful to an extent. Why not? Before I entertained the Randonaut ""delusion,"" if that's what a skeptic calls it, those birds were just ornamental and insignificant. Now, they brought me pleasure and peace by grounding me into the path for just a few moments of observation. Crows, in fact, are archaic signs of [Odin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huginn_and_Muninn) and the [Celtic Morrigan](https://mythology.net/others/gods/the-morrigan/).

Skepticism is warranted but empty

Cynics and buzzkills may call this behavior strange or simply validates confirmation bias. Wandering around in unknown neighborhoods paying attention to signs, trash, and numbers is what crazy people do.

I'll remind you that - in the grand human narrative in which we are all actors - millions of people assembled around invisible creatures and flicked on their phones to capture them.

That episode of culturally enriching behavior was called Pokémon Go. Millions of people laughed went on adventures with their children, and some died exploring locations populated by a faceless multinational corporation.

All we have is our own experience

Across the globe, people are connected by a common struggle, health, and isolation. The future is uncertain, but, rather than sink into despair or escapism, we can find hope by connecting to each other and ourselves. The relationship we have with ourselves and our internal dialogues can make us stronger, braver, and help guide the weak and vulnerable. Our own mind can be our most avid ally or an internal enemy. Solitude can be stressful, but now is the time to cultivate new habits and broaden perspectives to bring reflection and new growth as old paradigms fade.

Reframing our mindset will come from a variety of avenues, and most come naturally. My experience with Randonauting took me outside for an overdue walk and much-needed hopeful contemplation.

Randonauting and the Fantom-bot is a vehicle into the strange and mysterious - to create some novelty in one's existence. Give it a chance. It may be a 21st Century form of divination. At the very least, it's a way to explore the mundane with childlike wonder.

As soon as the music started playing I completely zoned out for over an hour forgot about all the Coronavirus stuff which is giving me horrible anixety, forgot about my problems with my bf, forgot about everything that's happened over the past 12 months (havent had an easy year got ill which nearly killed me and numerous other things) and just remembered happy times. 

It was nice while it lasted then I stopped listening and just came back to reality I guess. It's the happiest I've been for over 12 months",19Mar2020,1
113,"Hello, there. Why so sad?

I am bringing on my light. 

We're going to have a little fun. It is true, I am high potential, but yet I believe we're all made from the same stardust. We are all \*sacred\*. It has long been decided, that we would be here, together.

You are no fun at all. 

If only you would follow me, then we would have the greatest time. 

I'm in a psychiatric ward, and I asked them if I think too much of myself, but they said no, that I had no such disease, and even they said that I thought too little of myself. So I am adjusting to the information.  

Let's say that I am better than average. Then it seems, I would have more karma than average. Yet I keep being downvoted, even the best of me, the best of the best. 

And they say I lack confidence! What do you want, exactly?

Let's be practical...

I love everyone. I believe in everyone. We are all equal, and having equal fun. 

I want everyone to use the quarantine to change the world. We are all on the internet, having a good chat. People are not anymore stunted, crazed by the work effort. It is a time for the world to change forever.

The disease is slow, it is a joke. It is so sloooow, to be home, and with nothing to do! We should be planning a great return. Forget your investments, they're bust. We're going back to the beginning. We're going to issue a new currency, then stop backing the old one. This makes everyone broke, equally broke. 

This is fun! This is beloved socialism, as far as I'm told.

We can say that the government also controls the houses, that people should stop speculating on the godgiven right to be housed, without paying for it. Society creates a human, but it does \*not\* enslave the human, it can only create \*ethically\*. So that means, no string attached. We contribute out of our own volition. This is \*ethics\*. Society provides, then it reaps the rewards of collaboration, if only it deserves it. We can't allow a world which enslaves its constituents.

Then instead of creating 100 kinds of shampoos and paying shampoo-marketers, people would only invest efforts to progress on shampoos reasonably. We could have invented a great shampoo 100 years ago, and it'd be 95% as good as what's available now, for 1% of the man-effort. That would make society an order of magnitude more productive! Less bullshit, and more signal-to-noise ratio. It is like clearing up the fog.

Believe! Before of the end of the quarantine, we will have switched the nature of society.

You can downvote me, it doesn't matter. I know where to strike. I am tailored to succeed.

Anyway these few views are not worth more of my time.

I was just having fun.",19Mar2020,1
114,"Hello all, thanks for commenting in advance.

I am born into a family of musicians, and I many of my family members have been or are major music influencers. I'm young, not even finished highschool, and I absolutely hate school. I want to take the route of dropping out of highschool and focusing on music but my parents will stop speaking to me if I even mention not going to collage. The only way around this is to become successful as a producer during this time. Ny family mostly are classical musicians, while I produce hip hop beats. 

I know I have the resources, and while I have built a following for myself I'm just not making the money to the point where I can get to that point of being up there. I take hours a day emailing small artists for us to work, praying that one of them will respond, but it's just not enough.

122,"Sorry if this is long or doesn’t belong here, I just need to get this out. 

My partner has always had a fairly weak immune system due to things that have happened in his past. Just days before all of this covid stuff started happening in our province he became ill, and steadily got worse. After two weeks of being off work and seeing urgent care multiple times he was told he has pneumonia- they didn’t seem to think he had covid but he was advised to stay home until he was fully better. I’ve been trying to get us both on leave so I can take care of him, as he also has a condition that causes him to fall asleep frequently, but with his congestion and the fluid in his lungs, he often coughs up phlegm while he’s asleep and it poses a choking hazard. I wanted to be home to watch over him and help him rest because of how weak he’s been feeling, but I’m feeling fairly normal for the most part, aside from my regular congestion from allergies. Also wanted to make sure that me being in contact with others at work then coming home to him wasn’t going to put him at risk. 
I definitely think he deserves the leave, he’s obviously quite ill and it’s best for him to isolate himself, but I’m having troubles with accepting that it was the right thing to do and not just me subconsciously not wanting to work or something. I’m scared I’m inconveniencing people at my work by needing my shifts covered and I don’t want to annoy anyone or have them think I’m just being selfish by also getting leave for myself. 
Any insight from an outside point of view would help me a lot, even if it’s agreeing that I’m being selfish. Thanks all.",19Mar2020,1
123,"It was a long distance relationship. I loved her so muxh, I didn't mind her looks or anything. I tell you I'd have accepted her if she was an actual whale or one of those girls who are very, very ugly without make-up. Even if that was the case I'd have accepted her and loved her, no matter what. Last september she asked me out the first day we talked, we had so much fun talking and doing stuff together, we skyped and played minecraft and did all sorts of things. Used snap every day, I loved her so much. We were gonna have a kid, if it was a boy his name would be Harald, if a girl her name would be Violet. We bought rings for eachother to give as placeholder rings.

Oh and I'm 18 and she's 16

She accepted everything about me. She was an angel I was super happy to have in my life, she made my heart full. A Japanese girl. Of course there was always gonna be some sort of inner conflict, she wanted to live in Norway and i wanted to live in Japan. I'm Swedish, by the way. I didn't go out with her because she was Japanese though, I honestly couldn't care less where she was from. And I was fully ready to give up anything to be with her. 

And I really don't know what else to write. Up until yesterday, we talked very happily. Yestersay was our 200 days anniversary. I thought it was gonna continue forever, to some extent I still do, but no..  this feels so surreal. Even she couldn't believe it. What should I do now? I know I should aim for going to Japan, but how could I possibly cope breaking up with the most amazing girl in existence... and she even said I was the best when she broke up with me, this is hitting hard on her too...

125,"...in which I never knew could escalate. I mean, I do get anxious but it’s mostly something I can handle and shrug ogg. But ever since I started working, everytime I wake up the first thing I think of are things like “what if I missed on a deadline?, what if my boss rejects my output? what if my co-worker blames me on something I’ve finished days ago but is delayed due to my other teammate?” yknow what I mean.. there’s this ONE co-worker I really don’t like, and everytime I feel like he’s gonna talk to me to check on my progress, I get super SUPER anxious. Like in my mind the words that run through are just *“ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod don’t come near me*” and when he does I let out a huge sigh before I even respond to him. I don’t even look at him when we speak, that’s how he’s affected me.. Something that ticks me off the most? he doesn’t say thank you during or after a project, that’s my biggest pet peeve. He’s just plain rude I can’t bear to see him every day. So far he’s the only one I can’t stand and he can be too frank that his words are abusive. He would say ""*try to finish that today or I'll punch you in the face*"". Once I was on my way home and he called to ask about our project and said the same thing. Also, everytime I'm placed in a project with him, I don't feel good, confident, happy, excited, as much as I do with my other teammates. At times, a project is delayed because of another co-worker yet he would pin it on me.. I try not to let him affect me ever since I read this post about not letting other people control you or your emotions, but he can be too straightforward. He’s older than me and I’m quite new to the workplace so I try to limit my actions and I uphold the famous saying “kill them with kindness”.

I do feel like I’m a weak person with a weak mindset. The only thing that boosted my self esteem a bit was when my girl co-worker told our other co-worker that I appear to be strong or fierce (for lack of a better term) when people are joking around and I don't give in. I admit the workplace I'm in isn’t very healthy. They pick and joke around each other (sometimes in a very blunt way), curse one another even though our boss is around, have discreet sexual comments, etc. I guess that’s how they ""bond""? and I guess that’s the reason why this co-worker I dislike very much is too comfortable to offend me or because I'm younger and new and he knows I can't fight back yet.

That's it, I just wanted to share because I've been denying that my anxiety hasn't been bothering me for the past few months. Working from home is actually helping a little bit because his presence is not anywhere near me and I can work peacefully. Although when he texts me 'bout work, that's when I shout ""STOP"" at my computer just in case he hears it and leaves me alone.

I think I caught it by my own... bacteria. In my mouth. 

I do these saline rinses due to my extraction tooth a lot, but at that day before i got sick, my saliva felt so thick. So I swallowed my saliva that contained the salt from my saline rinse which I am certain that my saliva contained a lot of bacteria, thus, swallowing my saliva which got stuck in my throat that contained bacterial salt liquid- made me sick.

Because that liquid that was stuck in my throat that contained bacteria and salt and with thick saliva, leaving my throat irritated by the salt and bacteria. I began sneezing a lot afterwards and then my nose gradually leaked a lot as well. So i tried to drink water a lot, the thing was still stuck in my throat. I took a cold medicine for it.

During this time that we are all social distancing and working from home, everything that is happening in the world can make it tough to focus. I just kept finding it hard to even start the work that I was supposed to and ultimately ended up procrastinating for far too long.

So I tried using the classic Pomodoro Technique. Some of you may know this, but its principles of using quick bursts of output and regular intervals were exactly what I needed given the environment that many of us are working in.

My simple process was

* Choose a task
* Set the Pomodoro to 25 minutes
* Work on the task until the Pomodoro rings
* When the timer rings, take a short break (5 mins)
* After 4 “Pomodoros”, take a longer break (15-30)

This was so so helpful to me and I think that this indefinite time being spent at home can actually be put to good use now.

154,"A couple of clarifications- the hospital I work at is a superspecialised hospital dealing with mental health, we're not really a centre that is dealing with cases of coronavirus, however the hospital opposite ours is. Also, as one of the leading hospitals in our field in tje country, we get a LOT of cases from all over the country, even a fair few from abroad. My city has one of the highest counts of diagnosed cases of coronavirus in my country at present. 

My pre-existing condition is Type 1 Diabetes. Over the last few months, I have had fairly below average (by my standards, poor) control. Although my risk of contracting the coronavirus isn't higher than others, my risk of developing serious complications due to it is. 

I work as a trainee (student) psychologist. We've shut down all our non emergent appointments, so I effectively have to go to work only twice a week, which is on OPD days. Those are also the days where there is maximum exposure to crowds. Now, we're taking some precautions, but the risk, of course, is still there. 
My parents are worried sick and pleading with me to apply for leave on medical grounds. I get why they're concerned, but I just find it very unprofessional. To clarify, me not attending OPD will not significantly add to anyone else's burden, it'll probably run just the same without me. But I view it as wrong for me to do. 
I've spent all my life trying to be better so people notice me before my illness and that I don't seem weak in any way. Asking for leave now will just make me feel like I'm failing myself. I know my supervisors will easily grant it, possibly even encourage it. But I don't know what to do. I'm wondering if I should just tell them I took leave but go anyway.

I told him no strictly again and avoided him ever since.

167,"Needless to say, isolation has been extra-hard. We were together for 6 years, starting in high school, and we've been semi-long-distance for 5 years since college/grad school. She seemed off the last few weeks, finally said that she didn't know why but she didn't feel the same spark that she always had, and she was desperate to find it again. She felt like she needed to figure out what was wrong with her before she could continue with me. I drove halfway across the country twice just to be there for her in the last few weeks. On Monday, she told me that me being there still wasn't making her feel the things she hoped she'd feel, so I drove away in tears with the understanding that it was over. She texted me the next day and told me she fully believed the pain she was feeling wasn't that of a breakup, but of realizing she was making a mistake by letting me slip away. She said she needs time to find herself and doesn't know how much time, and she told me that she knows how selfish it is to ask me to wait for her. She genuinely is incredibly emotionally mature, and very intelligent. She's in a medical doctoral program and I've always known her to be very self-aware and empathetic. Most of all, she's normal. I've seen crazy... she's just... normal. I thought I would marry her one day. She said she'll get therapy and start thinking about herself this week, while on a trip that we planned together with her brother and friends. Meanwhile, I'm back home from grad school with my family. She knows she's putting me through hell, but I still intend to wait for her. We both talked briefly throughout the week-- we know that we love each other and we logically want each other to be our romantic partners in life. She just doesn't know why she can't feel that way right this second. 

The hardest part is not having someone to share my day with before bed. I just desperately want to tell her how I'm feeling, ask her about her day, etc. I've been writing in google doc as if I were talking to her, including my nightly goodnight text to her.

Right now I'm in a point where I want to raise my overall grade percentage but during the study session I find myself very distracted by my inner monologue; it could be anything me remembering certain events or talking to myself about things I want or self loathing about bad circumstances.

Seeing him in action, and watching him show me the places he shops at on the way to Costco and listening to why he chose those places is really delightful.

While he's moving about and talking I suddenly become aware of the grey hairs on his chin, and something in me is deeply humbled. Our relationship has never been one of observable affection. But god, do I appreciate him. I've recently become a beer enthusiast and I love how he asks me ""so how does that beer taste?"" Or ""Try it out, this one is on me"" despite not liking beer at all.

* My parents are split and my Dad feels more like a mentor than a Father.
* Dad is obsessed with my brother and I becoming air traffic controllers because it pays well
   * In a way, he believes money will make us happy (does it though?)
* I'm trying to climb my way up in Government because I feel like I'm making a difference, albeit small and slowly.

183,"I was a bad teenager. The type that teachers took bets on whether prison or McDonald’s was in my future. I made my mother’s life hell, between all the probation officers, courts, and stints in juvenile detention. 

One of my only memories of high school was when we were in math class, we were doing some extremely long equations that required you to write out your work or you were likely to get lost in your own head. I was sitting in my desk like usual, doing nothing. The teacher called on me after the allotted time and asked if I knew the answer. Like a deer in headlights I stared at it for about 30 seconds, slowly working it out in my head. I called out my answer, the people who were actually writing out their work confirmed I was right, and I’ll never forget what that teacher said. 

“What a waste.”

I dropped out a couple months later and got my GED at 17. I was working at McDonald’s when that same teacher came in and I rang up his order. I’m sure at least one teacher really won it big that day. A little while later I was walking down the street to work when I went past the recruiting office. I must have walked past it hundreds of times at that point, but something drew me in. I was at Fort Benning a few weeks later, and I never saw my mom as proud as she was as when I was in my dress greens, standing tall and looking good.

A short while later I was in Ramadi. Scared, angry, weak, strong, hungry, thirsty, tired, that man made hell was no place for anyone to be let alone a teenage boy barely on the cusp of manhood.

But like all things it came to an end, I came home and all was right with the world. I was just coming off a weekend of debauchery with my boys when I got the word from the Red Cross. Mother and stepfather killed in car crash, baby siblings in state custody. My anger problem and disrespect for authority had mellowed out considerably by this point, but when my company commander said, “Listen we need the numbers for NTC, be a team player and stick around for a couple months, than we’ll let you go home and sort this out. Your siblings aren’t going anywhere.” I had to be restrained from attacking him and was arrested by the MP’s. I thank god every day that my battalion Sergeant Major heard about the situation and put an end to the lunacy, and threatened violence on anyone who had a problem with my emergency leave.

I went home thinking I only had to get my siblings out long enough for a family member to come collect them, and help prepare my mother and stepfathers  funeral. When I got there the situation became more clear. Both grandfathers were dead, neither grandmother could take on the kids by themselves, the only aunt already could barely afford her four kids, and my older brother was a newlywed who had just graduated college, he couldn’t support them either. That just left me. I moved the kids and the grandmothers to where I was stationed, and since then I did the best I could. 

I was a heavy drinker before this, but since than I’ve never touched another drop. I quit smoking too. I never had a father and I would be damned if I was a bad role model. I learned to braid hair, do tea parties, all the names of Disney princesses. I taught my brother how to box, what type of cologne to wear, how to shave, how to flirt with girls. That first time in Iraq might have seemed like the hardest thing I would do at the time, but I never realized how much harder it would be when there are people who absolutely *need* you to come home. If by the cruel hands of fate I had come home in a box the first time around...... no one would have really missed me. Sure my mother would have told my siblings all about the older brother who died in a foreign land, but they would have never really known me enough to really be affected by it. 

I became a father at the age of 20 to a five year old girl and a three year old boy. That five year old girl is now a junior at a big 10 university, and that three year old boy is finishing out his senior year online due to Coronavirus. The last time I cried was right before I picked them up from the foster home. After that I needed to be strong. An infallible source of strength that they could always draw from. But today. Today I got in my car, parked in the parking lot of a McDonald’s just like the one I used to work at. And I cried. I cried so hard no sound came out, so hard that I thought I might suffocate.

187,"If I see one more post from a  rich celebrity who has to take time off a tour or a middle class American complaining about working from home under quarantine, I’ll fucking off myself. You are SO entitled.

I work at a local pizza chain and we are still forced to work through this pandemic. None of us will receive any paid leave or sick days if we close and we will likely get fired or essentially shunned if we call out. We get paid very little so hardly any of us have savings. Also, no health insurance or benefits.

I have to make food and accept cash and orders from customers who seemingly are making an effort to make skin contact with me, lean over the counter, cough on me, and still try to dine in even though the law no longer allows it and there are signs in our shop telling them not to. 

We are also currently delivering to people who have COVID-19 who somehow forget to mention it when ordering, but miraculously manage to remember, if they do mention it, once our driver with their food has arrived.

We got an email this week from corporate essentially telling us that we as employees are their family and we come first but to pretty much just keep working (harder) and sanitize stuff with the “sanitizer stations” they lied about providing. Again, no sick leave, nothing...but we’re family and we come first :)

Also they’re providing huge coupons to customers in attempt to bring more people in which is exactly the opposite of what they should be doing right now.
Additionally our store owner and boss keeps making corona jokes and telling us it’s not serious and not to trust what they’re saying on the news. 

ALSO a group of my coworkers just got back from hanging out in NYC the past few days, you know, the epicenter of coronavirus in the US right now.. and I have to work closely with them. One of which is a girl who believes corona is just a cold, and I don’t trust she’s washing her hands regularly.

Honestly I would stop showing up, but I’ve worked there for 2.5 years and I’m afraid to have such a huge gap on my resume, and oh also I won’t get paid. I’d put in my 2 weeks, but a lot can be contracted in that time frame. On top of all this, my boss (the owner) has told me and the store manager that he will provide only us jobs at the supermarket he partially manages if the pizza store closes. And, well, since everyone else in the food industry is jobless right now and will be scrambling to find work, I’m afraid to lose that opportunity.

On top of all this, I have underlying health conditions and a family history of many diseases and would be considered of high risk for infection. I.should.not.be.working. Sorry, NONE OF US SHOULD BE WORKING.

I’m already feeling unwell after just half of my work week. I’m coughing and have a headache, but if I don’t come to work, I’m fucked. I’m afraid I’m going to get worse and that I’ll be passing it on to every customer who walks in as well as my coworkers.

The worst part is that the owner was likely planning on closing the store for good anyway. What’s the point in staying open through this?

All I’m hearing on the news is that only essential business should be open right now. Pizza and chicken wings are not essential. 

So yeah, if you’ve gotten this far, congratulations for being able to withstand my sick angry rant. 

I have two pieces of advice for you:

Do not complain about working from home or being on leave. You have it so good right now. You are privileged as fuck, now enjoy it.

Secondly, STOP ORDERING FROM RESTAURANTS. BUSINESS WILL BE SHITTY NO MATTER WHAT RIGHT NOW . YOU ARE ONLY ENCOURAGING OWNERS TO STAY OPEN LONGER AND YOU ARE PUTTING THE ACTUAL WORKERS AT RISK OF LITERAL POTENTIAL DEATH.",19Mar2020,2

194,"In this moment, with my current emotional state and current life situation, there must be an optimal idea that could be put in my head to do me the most good. Right? Like out of all the things I could hear right now, say from a friend or a piece of content, there must be one thing that will put me in the mindset that is likely to do me the most good. Right? One lesson that maybe would cause me to act or feel in a way that is most positive for me compared to all others.",19Mar2020,1
195,"I've been frugal and an obsessive saver most of my life. Putting as much as I could into my life's savings. I once3 worked 7 days a week for 7 months straight one year to make overtime money to put into savings. ANother year I worked 5 months straight. Another year 3 months straight. 

Then, after twenty years of working for a company, I got laid off so they could save money. Took sporatic jobs, worked 7 days a week for 3 months at one. Got laid off 2 days before Christmas. Living off my life's savings now.",19Mar2020,2
196,I tried out for volleyball. I didn’t make it. I cried that whole Saturday. A few days past I’m feeling fine only when I don’t think about it. When I think about it I cry immediately. It’s been about TWO MONTHS and I can’t get over it. I made a lot of new friends. It feels like we’re all split up and it doesn’t feel the same anymore. My only friend that really cares and loves me is moving away. I act like I’m fine with it and don’t care. But it’s really eating me up. She has so many things that I don’t. Even if she did do something worse then me it doesn’t matter I still hate myself. All I’ve wanted is to be better then her but no matter what I do I can never be better. She has a B right now and I would’ve killed for this last year but I still feel jealous. She has friends that actually care about her. My best friend even likes her more than me. And me and her are separating. She doesn’t really want to be around me. She’s just happy with her. I’m never gonna be good enough. And I’ve been doing running for a long time and I’m still not good enough for the track team. Every time I run I get these terrible cramps and usually I can run through them but I couldn’t this time so I only ran two laps and my dad called me a “natural runner” and with volleyball when we were practicing he didn’t say if I got on the team he said when I got on the team but I didn’t even get on the team. And now when I have to tell him I can’t try out for the track team he’s going to be so disappointed. I did this academic team thing and I did TERRIBLE I practiced so much and said that that was the one thing I could do. But I didn’t even answer a question. I feel so pathetic and I can’t talk to anyone because they’re all moving away from me and everyone hates me and I can’t do anything about it. I know this didn’t make any sense but I really don’t care I just want fucking attention like the selfish bitch I am.,19Mar2020,1
197,K so I don’t know where else to post this but does any one else’s BO smell like weed? I’ve never smoked a day in my life but my BO sometimes smells like kush. What’s going on?,19Mar2020,1
