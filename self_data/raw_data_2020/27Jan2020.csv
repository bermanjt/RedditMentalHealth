Last night, at about 2am, I had an ovarian cyst that burst. The pain was awful and lasted hours. He jumped out of bed to get me a hot water bottle, and lay with me in the dark naked, just stroking my back. 

He kisses my tears, my ankles, the back of my neck. My sticky-outy knees. My hands. Oh, god, *his hands.* They're so beautiful. Hes so beautiful. His eyes are dark blue, kind of like when you see pictures of the world from afar, with swirls of white clouds and browns. Even his name, to me, is beautiful. The full name, not the short version. I take pictures of him all the time with the film camera he bought me. I'd take them of anything. His back, his shoulders, the hairs trailing down his stomach. I'm so utterly terrified of anything happening to him. I'll probably delete this post, I just have to get the words out there while I'm feeling so emotional.

Years ago, my dad gifted my mum Brian Patten's Love Poems before he died, and I've always remembered one of the lines. It seems kind of fitting 

""For no other reason that I love him wholly, I am here; my world has shrunk to a boyish chest.""",27Jan2020,1

4,"I graduated high school in 2009.  I didn't feel emotionally ready for college and I've never enjoyed school, but I felt pressured to go to school by society, so I went.  I spent three and a half years in college, but struggled academically and socially and wasn't motivated.  

After three and a half years and only 81 credit hours, I decided to take a break from school.  I was living at home with my family and my relationships with my family were suffering, so I moved to another city in hopes of working.  However, I could only get retail jobs, so I decided to go back to school after two years of working retail.  

Three years after I returned to school, nine years after I graduated high school, I finally had my degree.  But the search for a postgrad job was a struggle.  I spent two years longing for a better job with more money so I could live by myself (I've been living with roommates since I moved out) and go see the people and things I'm a fan of in events more.  

See, I love the people and things I'm a fan of more than anything.  And I'm not kidding.  They're the first things I think about when I get up in the morning and the last things I think about before I go to bed.  Multiple times a day, I check websites related to them for news.  My bedroom is filled with merchandise related to them.  I spend all my extra money (what little there is) on merchandise and tickets to events.  I've always struggled to form close relationships, so maybe that's part of why I'm so attached.  I doubt the people I consider my best friends consider me one of their best friends.

So, yeah.  I've spent two years applying for jobs.  I recently finally got a job offer.  It pays a lot more than my current job, but still, I need to save money after basically spending every penny I earned for the past seven years.  This new job is in my hometown and I'll be living with family to save for a house for a little.

So, I got what I spent two years wanting and I feel no sense of satisfaction.  Instead, I just feel so much more stress.

First of all, houses cost more than I expected.  I was looking at house prices in the city where my new job is and they're usually around 200K-300K.  One bedroom apartments tend to start around 800 a month.  I might need to live with my family for longer than I anticipated.  And I'm worried about that.  My relationship with my family has been very up and down through the years.  When I lived with my parents for a year when I was in college, we argued constantly.  Despite the fact that I'm close to 30, my parents still seem to see me as a child and constantly ask about my whereabouts.  I'm worried that'll happen once I move back in with them.  Every time I go home and visit, they always text me when I go out.  And I know they don't like that I'm such a fangirl.  Something I'm looking forward to about moving back home is being close to my favorite sports team and I'm sure they won't like that I plan to go to a LOT of games.  Since I'll be living rent free with them, I feel like I should comply with what they want because they could just as easily tell me to find my own place and I need to save up to buy myself a house.

And while I've spent the past two years complaining about my current job, I feel sad to be leaving it, something I didn't expect.  My coworkers are really the closest thing to friends I have and I'm really going to miss them.  I don't do things with them outside of work, but I talk to them at work.  And my job, for the most part, puts up with the fact that I'm not mainstream.  They let me step off the floor when I need to and they let me take time off to go see the people and things I'm a fan of.  The new job might not like that I fidget a lot, sometimes need to get up and move around and that I'm the type of fan they'd make fun of in movies and books.

I got exactly what I wanted and now I feel just as bad as I did before.  When I was packing up my apartment, I was just crying because I felt so sad about giving up living independently and fearful about starting the new job.  And I know I should be grateful that I finally will have a job that pays better.

The truth is, I was never a career oriented person.  I don't know if it makes me lazy or stupid or whatnot, but I always just wanted to get married, have kids and be a stay at home mom.  But when I tried dating, I really didn't like it.  I've never liked going out (except to see the people and things I'm a fan of) because noise and crowds overwhelm me.  Usually when I would go out with friends, we'd do a meal because that's very structured.  Texting and talking on the phone with the people I was dating was a huge burden.  And then there was the physical stuff.  I hated when the people I dated held my hand or put their arms around me or wanted to cuddle, so I can only imagine what my reaction would have been when things like sex came up.  With family and friends, you can call and text them every so often and get together for an hour once in a while, but with people you're dating, you kind of have to talk to them every day and spend a lot of time with them.  I like my space a lot.  Even when I go out, to movies, zoos, museums, sporting events, etc, I generally go by myself so I can go at my own pace.  I often just want to be in my room and on my fan sites.  I really wanted to live by myself, but I need to save money first, and then there's taxes and mortgages to think about.

I seriously think there's something wrong with me.  I'm crying right now, was crying when I was packing up my apartment.  The money I saved for my trip to two major events for things I'm a fan of this summer has to go toward moving expenses, and I'm crushed because on bad days I would say to myself, ""you have the convention and the all star game to look forward to.""  While living with my parents, I'm sure they'll interrogate me if I ever want to go out and not like that I'm going out by myself.

But my current job isn't bringing in enough money and I don't like it.  At least I'm passable at it.  I'm not sure if I'll enjoy or be good at the new job either.

And I'm sorry for posting all this personal information on reddit.  Since I've spent two years wanting a new job and now I have one and am unhappy about different things, I don't feel like I can go to anyone I know offline.",27Jan2020,1
5,"It’s only January but I feel like my year’s already fucked. And yeah I know time is a social construct blah blah blah whatever my point still stands.

So on 15th December, my grandma passed away suddenly.  Her funeral was on January 15th. Might’ve been the worst day of my life and I miss her so much and it still doesn’t make sense to me that she’s gone. Also it was obviously really tough on my family which was so so hard and heartbreaking to see.  But I’m coping. I think? 

On NYE I drunkenly expressed my love for this girl I have a crush on. I kinda thought she liked me back because I’m STUPID and DELUSIONAL. She didn’t. We’re still friends though. Also I’ve never ever dated anyone or had anyone like me back which I get upset about every now and then. Oh well I guess.

I’m back at college and I feel like I’m falling behind on all my subjects. However I’m not particularly motivated to catch up. At all. I just need more time like a couple weeks or something to just really get my shit together but there’s no time and although my teachers are aware of the situation to do with grandma, I feel like they’re still not being very patient. 

I have a job I got it back in December it’s my first job. I got it because one of my close friends works there and she was the only reason I didn’t dread going in every weekend. But now she has to quit soon because of a situation she’s in and so now I’ve nothing to look forward to. And one of my co-workers who I work closest with literally fucking HATES me and doesn’t try to hide it. It makes me so anxious and upset and I’m trying not to cry as I write this.  I just wish he was nicer to me because I already hate going in as much as it is and I really didn’t need his negativity to make me feel even more shitty. So yeah, those are my weekends ruined too.

I just feel like there’s no aspect of my life going too well. I do want to fix my college situation but it’s so hard. I just want to start over on a blank slate.

It just sucks because before I started college I was convinced I was gonna be a new, better, mentally healthy, motivated version of myself with new friends and I thought I’d be thriving. But like everything else in life I look forward to, none of it worked out how I wanted it to and so again I’ve been disappointed.

I’m not happy and I don’t know what to do.

On the bright side, I got a new piercing recently and it makes me look nicer.",27Jan2020,1
6,"I’m using a throwaway for obvious reasons here.


     Today my friends can over to play some d&amp;d.  We played for a bit and finished our campaign.  Afterwards we head out in our longboards like we usually do and rode all the way to the downtown suffern area of where I live.  We had a good time cruising for a while and bought some monster.  At the end of town there is a small hiking trail (I believe bear mountain). Where you can hike up to a rock with a pretty view of the highway, sheraton, and sun.  My friend brought his dice and a jar I gave him to put them in, they where stored in his backpack.  He also brought his cousins small my little pony pony to put into the jar as a joke.  I then told my friend who I will call Chris, “Hey you should cum in the jar”.  He when to a hidden area and jacked off into the jar, he called us over thinking he was done but after all he wasn’t.  Compared to me, I realized his penis was massive.  I realized just how small I am and just was in shock.  Me and all my other friends where just joking about it but we were all just surprised.  Me and Chris where always close friends and I didn’t know how to feel so I tried to ignore it.  Afterwards he did cum in the jar with the mlp figure in it.  It was fucking hilarious.  We hid the jar under some rocks off the trail where nobody would find it.  We proceeded to head back down the hill.  We cruised around for a while, got some pizza, got good clips, and headed home.  On our way back we had to ride past lake Antrim nearby.  As we got near we saw police, firemen, and paramedics.  We rode by wondering what was going on when we saw a body on a stretcher being Zipped into a bag.  We stopped to look only to be confronted.  An officer saw us standing by the caution tape around the scene and told us to go when we asked about what was happening.  We rode home and by the time we got there, we saw the news posted online.  A 18 your old boy who has been missing since December 20th was pulled from lake Antrim after he died falling through ice.  The rest of the day me and all my friends where just so worn out and we couldn’t really think about it.  Now, after I took a nap, I’m shocked.  I have a small penis and my friend is huge, I’m a late bloomer or just have a micro penis, and I saw a dead body zipped into a bag.  Was quite the day, still don’t know what the think, fuck.",27Jan2020,1

12,"So it was a nice day and the snow is melting, and I went to take a little hike down to the river. Halfway there something jumped on me from behind - it was a big hefty black lab, jumping around like I was his long lost friend. I petted him and tried to settle him down, but he had so much energy it was clear he needed some exercise. No sign of anyone around, so I jogged down to the park with him and we ran around, horsed around in the snow drifts and so forth. Then I walked back to the neighborhood and I knocked on doors to find his owner. After a few minutes a guy drove by and stopped, got out and called the dog - it was his daughters, and the house was right there. 

So I had a nice day and helped a dog out, and the dog had a nice day. If I had a dog I'd walk him every day so he didn't feel too pent up and have to bust out of the yard to have a little fun.",27Jan2020,1

He’s taken to ingesting small doses of kerosene daily, which he claims to purify by using activated charcoal. I visited him over the weekend when he told me about this new habit of his and I tried a shot because I thought what the hell, I don’t care about personal health. It was oily and unpleasant and I felt nauseous up to a few hours afterward but honestly I did not feel that bad. I’m a little worried though that if he is really ingesting kerosene daily that he might be really causing damage to his body, but I have no idea if I tried to convince him to stop if he would listen to me. This is also a person who claims unironically that Jews run the economy and that gay people are a product of the shadow government trying to stop people from reproducing. Surprisingly, no he has not heard of infowars.

22,"I have had two other reddit accounts in the past, both of which are banned from tons of subreddits because of my actions. These actions were mainly due to my past mental health problems which have cleared up within the past month or two. I decided to make a new account because of reddit's unforgiving nature. It seems it all started when I was sent to a behavioral health hospital (Palo Verde in Tucson, just in case you are familiar with it) because my mental health got so bad that I had made a plan to commit suicide. My mom found out when I had tried to call the suicide prevention hotline, but I had hung up on the operator because I started to feel uncomfortable when he started to ask me personal questions.

 The operator then proceeded to trace my call and call the cops. The day after my Mom talked to me about it, and told me that she is going to get me help the next day!

 That day was the start of a new beginning. At the hospital I learned how to handle myself, how to control myself, but most importantly, that people are there for me and want to help me, as well as many more things. This gave me the power to move on from all of my old problems and start out with a clean slate.

Most of my demons are still there, but I have been trying, and for the most part succeding at keeping them crammed at the bottom of my brain.

Day after day I coax myself out from the safety of my bed by repeating the same lies. “Today will be great.” “You just have to try harder and it’ll pay off.” “Everyone is counting on you.” Then I paint my face and put on the clothes that I deliberately picked out in order to feel good about myself. I pour cup after cup of coffee hoping that the caffeine high will dull the ache in my soul. It’s like I’m running a marathon in wet cement. I feel heavy.

As I sit here writing, tears pouring down my face, I feel like such a failure. A lifetime’s worth of poor choices gathering into these tears. I remember a different time. One when I really thought that I could be anything. That’s what our parents told us. We were special and could be anything we wanted. I wrote essay after essay about what I was going to be when I grew up. Not one of those papers was titled “Unappreciated Office Slave Suffering from Acute Depression due to Job Stress.” I failed.

It’s disappointing. I always thought that if I could get a good job, and make more money, life would be happy. I’m realizing that isn’t true. I feel like a prostitute. I whore myself to a company who won’t remember my face. I’m there to serve a need and have none of my own. What kind of life is this? I go back and forth to a cubicle farm that reduces me to tears on Sunday nights. To do what? To provide me money that I can use to buy myself things in a misguided effort to ease the sadness? That doesn’t make any sense and yet that’s exactly what I do. This is what I’ve worked so hard for. It’s absolute shit.

Fear keeps me immobilized. I’m scared of what my children will think if I cannot provide the quality of life that they receive now. I’m afraid of what my partner will think if I do not contribute as much as I do now.  I’m afraid of what our lives will become if I bring in less money. I am afraid of not being able to pay bills and continue down the path of my goals. I’m afraid that if I leave it will just be another poor life decision that I’m left to face years down the road. Fear keeps me crippled but I don’t think I can go on like this. I’m left feeling ashamed and inadequate.

Maybe, life is simpler than I’m making it. Maybe, all of this is just fighting with myself. Maybe, all of my fears are unimportant. Maybe, all the things that make me unhappy are unimportant too. Either way, tonight, I’m feeling stuck and exhausted.",27Jan2020,1

28,"This program will help you undo financial bondage.

The bible shows that every person should follow processes based on practical principles performed with the right motive, purpose, and reverence for the LORD that make him/her fruitful and cause multiplication of things in life He entrusts to him/her, including finances. This allows him / her to produce wealth for Kingdom purposes (including caring for oneself and family), which is a good thing that should be welcomed by all believers. 

Surely, there are some very rich and wealthy Christians who love God as much as the poor and middle class love Him. The fact that they often live in more expensive earthly housing, cars, and such is no reason for anyone to demean their contribution to society in providing pathways to employment and greater income earning opportunities. In every generation God has had very rich men and women who loved Him and were intent on fulfilling His will in life, including entrepreneurship, employment, and relationships (Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, Josiah, well-to-do Shunammite woman, Esther, Joseph of Arimathea, Lydia, Tabitha (Dorcas), etc.). In each of their time periods there were poor people who struggled, yet the bible does not command rich people as a whole to forsake wealth building. Rather, it instructs them to be generous and create opportunities, like gleaning fields, that the poor can utilize as pathways to provide for immediate needs and learn skills that help them build future prosperity.

Those who are rich on this Earth should never lose empathy for the plight of the poor and should at all times use a great measure of their wealth to help lift them out of poverty. However, they should never feel ashamed, sinful, unrighteous, unholy, or out of God's will for having been used by God to build wealth when they do it in a way that pleases Him (according to biblical principles with guidance from the Holy Spirit). In this regard, everyone should be humble, meek, and attentive to His voice in every decision we make. In the same way, those currently poor or middle-income are also greatly loved by God and should not feel ashamed as long as they also listen to the Holy Spirit and seek to move forward in good stewardship that orders their lives and activities, including finances, in ways the bible describes as fruitful. 

Those who build great businesses employ the bulk of people around the world. They serve best by living in that spiritual calling using skills, abilities, and assets to help as many people as possible be fruitful for the benefit of the Kingdom of God, their families, and neighbors. No one pleases the LORD when they mistreat others, operate in selfishness, or make money and possessions their idols (the love of their lives). Everyone should seek His instruction and guidance, so all of life, including finance, is used to help everyone around them be fruitful, take dominion over the Earth, and multiply.

Please pray for this ministry, email me with any questions, and contact me to speak at your business or ministry conference or workshop. May the LORD bless you richly as you follow His plan!

I care a lot to the point where I feel like I go too far and overthink everything and even day dream about them way too much. Wtf is this called? How can I get this under control? It’s so unhealthy for me. I already know this. It gets me more attached to them than I should be for something that’s just starting out. I fear attachment due to the possibility of getting hurt so I draw away when I get too close yet at the same time I long to linger in these fantasies with him and feel like being with him as much as I can.

I am extremely sad to see my idol die, to hear about his family die. It makes me sad and I feel down, but I didn’t know him or his family and my brain just feels confused on how to feel because of this I think.

How do you cope or make sense of this? I’ve never felt like this of any celebrity’s death before.",27Jan2020,1
35,"As I lay down in my bed on this quiet cold night; the sound of a distant siren disrupts my peace, as it gets closer and closer the sound propels through the cold air, I feel genuine terror. I can imagine the wheels of the vehicle that carries that siren slide thru the cold pavement, I imagine it breaking thru the cold wind. For whatever reason that siren is on, it means something important is happening, someone is in pain, or someone is being chased. 

We've got sirens for bad things, we've got a tornado siren, an earthquake siren, police siren, and so on. It's easy to relate the sound in the distance to fear.

I cover myself with my blanket so I can warm myself. The sound is by now gone but the feeling remains. For some reason, even though I live in a densely populated area, the siren makes me feel loneliness, anguish, and fear.",27Jan2020,1
36,(Btw this isn’t in r/relationshipadvice bec moal judgment isn’t alowed)  im Steven (24m) my girlfriend had a guy friend who she was hanging out at a dinner party after everyone left i was at work. he tried to flirt and grab her but not violently but he knows she has a boyfriend. My girlfriend asked me if i was uncomfortable with them still being cool after he apologized and i told her yes because i don’t know this person and past actions of theirs make me not trust them. My girlfriend told me that she respects me and that the choice is up to me and i told her i wasn’t comfortable so she doesn’t talk to him anymore . Am i being possessive or a bad boyfriend? i told her that i don’t trust him but if she thinks that he wont try anything again that they can still be friends.,27Jan2020,1

The time where I didn’t we were a little tipsy. I’ve practiced putting on the condom before alone and I’m fine and able to maintain erection. Now I’m in my own head about and can’t stop thinking about it. The feeling is so fucking bad because I feel that I’ve disappointed her but I can’t control it. I don’t know if it’s cause I’m anxious about it. There’s also another element. I’m catholic and I’ve gone to mass every Sunday for as long as I can remember and I wonder if there is some subconscious going on. I don’t know. I’m at a loss. Pissed at myself.

47,"We met in college, studied the same thing and even got internship at the same place. After a LONG time we graduated, and got engaged. I remember cooking with her mother and calling her father, “dad” I remember playing video games with her little brother everything was great. The way she used to look at me and the feelings I used to feel for her, I truly thought love was real and that she and I would be together forever. Until one day I came home earlier from work because I feel sick as fuck. And i even almost the crashed the damn car that’s how fucking dizzy I was. When I finally arrive at home I see a big black SUV in our driveway, I know our neighbor has one so I got a little annoyed but I I wasn’t gonna bitch about it right now. Maybe tomorrow is what I was thinking. I open the door, I see male boots. So I thought it was an unexpected visit from her best friend from college who is lesbian I walk to the living-room and I hear noises from upstairs, first I sit and I decide not to do anything but the noises kept getting louder and then my hearth started beating like a motherfucker. What the fuck, no way? NOO WAY those thoughts are repeated. As I walk the stairs, each step got heavier, with each step I could literally feel my hearth beating faster now I felt it in my throat. I arrive to the bedroom, open the door and there she is on top of him riding the bastard. He sees me and he has his hands on her hips and continues to push, she turned back and saw me. At the moment I remember and old poker commercial of Phil ivey catching his wife cheating and he continued to have his pokerface showing no emotions. That’s exactly what I wanted to do, but that didn’t happen I fucking pucked my lungs out. I go to the bathroom and lock the door. She was banging the door, crying and shouting apologizing etc, I heard her and didn’t hear her at the same time it’s hard to explain It’s like…….Imagine someone talking to you and then you hear a very loud sine wave cutting through the conversation. I wash my face, and then I stared at the mirror, I was completely fucking bleach, I didn't even recognize myself it was like staring at a ghost. I open the door push her aside and go back to the room. I walk to the wardrobe and the bastard is STILL IN MY MOTHERFUCKING BEDROOM. With a t-shirt and boxer shorts  I completely ignore the bastard, I’m at the wardrobe, and I take her clothes out and throw them on the floor. Now she’s arguing with him, the bastard was fucking shredded man, and his bulge was bigger than mine, I never felt so small and humiliated in my fucking life. Never ever had I felt this before. It was numb rage with calculation's in my mind premeditated murder. He looks at me and says its a federal crime to fight him, I continue ignoring him. My fiance pushes him around and tells him she only fucked him out of nostalgia and that I'm better, and then he says to her (while I am IN THE MOTHERFUCKING ROOM) “When he kissed you he was kissing my dick and when he was licking your pussy he was eating my cum.” At that moment I wanted to kill them both but I continued throwing her clothes on the floor, then I went downstairs to the living room and stared at the TV (it was off) After a minute or so the bastard is on the stairs,walks to the door, puts his shoes on and leaves. There I was alone with her. She’s crying and yelling begging for forgiveness. I go to her with both of my hands on her neck, and I stare at her with my eyes wide open. I tell her how humiliated I felt, I told her how I cant stop thinking about on how many places in the house he could’ve fucked her. So I told her to clean the entire house. I want new carpet, new bed sheets etc, within one day the house felt new. I have all her clothes on the floor it was like a mountain. I tell her she needs to go to her parents house and she told me she cant because her parents are expecting us to get married. Then I punched her in the face and broke her jaw. She went to the hospital alone and stayed at a motel for 5 months. Meanwhile she was gone I kept looking at the camera recordings and thought of sending this to her parents and brother (her family is extremely religious and conservative)I didn't send it yet. In those 5 months that she was gone, I worked out six times a week for 3 months straight and then I started a steroid cycle. I am doing everything I can to not feel that feeling but it’s still there and I cant get rid off it. The money that was supposed to be used for the wedding, I used it for high class hookers and cocaine, and of course steroids I even fucked a porn star. Everything I do, no matter what I cant get rid of this disgusting feeling of humiliation and rage. Then one day I get a call from my fiance she says the wedding is 1 month away and that her parents wanna visit. And talk about our “plans”. I allowed her to return and when she came back I demanded to get my dick sucked so she did. Then I fucked her in the ass against her will, my dick was covered in blood, so I put it back in her mouth, I pull her hair, and she’s crying I felt better. I did that a for few days  until her parents came to visit. I acted like everything was fine, we both acted like a happy couple. Her mother brought the ingredients to make Lasagne and tiramisu. We cooked together again like a team, my fiance sat on the table with her father, drinking beers. While I was in the kitchen with her mother I constantly was thinking of killing her daughter. Later that day I wrote about how much of a whore is, and I send it to her parents and little brother. The next day when she woke up from sleep after I fucked her ass, I told her I send the recording to everyone she knew. She immediately went downstairs to the kitchen and slit her left wrist. I take her and drive her to the hospital. While she’s being taken care of I started to realize that I am no longer myself, I have become pure evil, I am worse than a demon. The rage and humiliation is gone, there’s nothing but regret. I left her at the hospital and never heard again from her and her family. I am really scared of what I have become, I will never have a relationship again.",27Jan2020,1

49,"I didn't know I was laying in bed alone until I heard the shower turn on. You started playing Frank Ocean's ""In My Room"" on the speaker in the bathroom. That was what really woke me. I had been obsessed with this song lately. I envisioned a night where I play it for us while we kissed. But this was better.

I rolled over and opened my eyes. The white walls of your temporary apartment were shadowed gray. I thought about how you were only in my town for a month for work.

A frame hanging on the wall with a random picture. Might be the default photo that came with it when it was purchased. The hallway to the right was lit orange from the hallway lights. 

I roll over again to face the window.  White light desperately peaking through the blinds. It might have been 9am. I thought about getting up to let sunlight in but I decided to leave

the privacy of this moment untouched. 

My naked body was tangled in the white bed sheets while I stared at the walls when I heard you open the bathroom door. 

The smell of your body wash and cologne instantly rushed the room. My chest got warm. I hugged the pillow tighter. My eyebrows relaxed. I grew a 

smirk on my face. My body instantly turned towards the direction of your scent. It was as if you had just cast a spell on me.

I stared at the hallway waiting for you to appear. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-There's something bittersweet about us. The fact that we are not boyfriend and girlfriend yet you say ""tell me I'm yours"" when we have sex. You tell

me to open up to you. You get frustrated when I'm cautious about emotions around you yet you shut me out when I cave in. 

I like the fact that you are not permanent. There's something about knowing that I only have you for a limited time when you're in my state for work. 

It makes every moment together sensuous. It's dangerous when two people with mental issues cross paths. But I see beauty in it. 

There are moments when we let our guard down and share our feelings of emptiness and cravings for human connection. We've laid in bed, fully clothed, our legs intertwined as we

look at each other as share our experiences with psychiatric medications, as if we are conversating about childhood memories.

You let me look through the gym bag you bring with you on trips. It's filled only with prescribed bottles of psychiatric medications. I sift through your bottles as if I'm looking at a baseball card collection. You hold up one by one: ""This one's for PTSD. This one's for bipolar. This one's for anxiety. This one's to sleep.""

These moments create what we are looking for: understanding and acceptance. However, it is temporary. Almost artificial. Our addiction to not let ourselves be loved by others intervenes as soon as you depart. Who are we kidding though? There's no way we could ever work. You like having your own life and I like having my own. There's an unspoken agreement that we are meant only to be a secret. We can't live our lives together side by side. We are only meant to linger in the background.-

""Oh hi!"" As you walked in. You peaked at my exposed body before picking your bag up from the ground. 

""I love that you woke me up with that song."" I said as I wrapped more sheets around my torso. I had heart eyes.  

""It's a damn good song."" You said as you made your way to the bedroom door to step out.

""Sucks that it ends so abruptly."" I said louder as you were exiting out the room. 

You stopped to turn around and looked at me as you grab the door knob, ""Yeah, like we do."" You smiled mischievously and closed the door. 

I rested my head on the pillow while i stared at the door. I laid there with those statements repeating over and over in my head 

\*""Sucks that it ends so abruptly."" ""Yeah, like we do."" I couldn't help but grin. It's so true. But I don't mind it.\*",27Jan2020,1
51,"This is my absolute last effort. I NEED to move out of my abusive, alcoholic parents' house, but the job I'm at now doesn't afford me the ability to do that. I work myself to the absolute bone for shit pay and all I get in return are commands to work even harder. I cry at work on a regular basis and so do my coworkers because the stress is so extreme, and all of this for fucking $11/hr. Fuck you Starbucks. Quit your bullshit saying you care so much about your employees. 



It's not all about work. My entire life is shit and always has been. My only dream was to graduate college but I failed *miserably,* can't go back possibly ever but certainly not in the next decade, racked up a ton of debt, ruined my credit, lost all my friends, gained 80lbs, the list goes on. My life is completely in shambles and I have nobody and nothing. And now I live with parents who don't give two shits and whose house they've neglected so much for 10+ years that I think it's a serious health hazard to even be here. Not to mention they act like 43 year old children. 



And don't tell me to see a therapist because I have been for five years and it doesn't help. Nothing does, I've tried it all. 10 meds now, therapists, groups, even hospitalization. Doesn't help when your life is just fucked up.

53,"About two or three months ago, a very close friend told me that talking to me about my problems was too painful and that I was toxic because of it. The thing is, I know she's right. I'm not trying to hurt anyone or bring them down but the more I talk about the things that make me upset, the more I spiral, and then I just get more upset. It's a self-sustaining loop until I either fall asleep or have a mental breakdown. No matter what anyone tried to do to help me, I took them down with me. I refused to float, I sank and took all who would try to help me and made them drown in my sorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

Things are looking up for me. I have no reason to be sad. But right now, for no apparent reason, I'm sad. I feel worthless and alone. And I think about how the more I talk about it and the more I try to work through it the worse everything gets. I'm the person everyone goes to to talk and vent. But I don't just need to let some things go, I somehow have an infinite source of garbage at my core. All I want is to not be alone. If I'm alone, no one gets hurt. Just me. If I talk to someone I hurt them. What do you do when you're only capable of causing pain. How do I let this pass when it always starts to feel like too much to bare. Clearly I can bare it.

I doubt many would read this anyway but here goes..

I'm 25F and bi. Only ever had 1 romantic relationship with a girl I was in love with for 6 yrs who hates my guts now because we insisted on 'being friends' when she was only bi-curious and I had been serious

I do admit I had done her wrong because I did tell my friends some of her secrets, even if I did it in hopes of having more people help her and understand her better. But she kept blaming me for our mutual friends taking my side after we broke up when she's the one who isolated herself from everyone. Plus she couldn't even apologize to my face after shutting me up out of petty reasons probably as she's afraid I might convince her to keep our friendship (which I did before) because she just wanted to cut ties apparently (which she had done multiple times)

We used to text and call and chat a Lot, but after we separated, I've been turned off from doing any of the above with enthusiasm since then.

After maybe 2 1/2 yrs, I can finally say I'm starting to moving on. And now there's a girl I like at my new job and I see her name in the suggestions list on social media but I keep thinking that it might be too weird or too soon for me to add her and I just want to avoid previous mistakes. Is it though? Or is it insecurity talking?

I also noticed that I fall easily for girls more often than guys but I always had the notion that I set a higher standard for them - only ever had a crush on 4 guys in total since elementary.

I always insist that being single is awesome, liberating, blah blah.. tho it gets pretty lonely but I still couldn't go for several guys who did like me because they weren't my type. Makes me a bit guilty considering I'm ugly and clumsy and weird",27Jan2020,1

The last 3 points at the time of creation of this post, 27/1/20 have all been basically right on the line. So i'm confident this represents the real trend.

I want to keep everything in one spot from now on, and possibly just link here instead, so here it is.

* **[Link to the prediction album](https://imgur.com/gallery/4axghh1)** *

I am using google sheets, but since I can't seem to work out how to share it anonymously, which would be nice since I could just update it in real time, i'll just keep adding screenshots to an imgur album.

This dataset is my best guess, and is just a personal tally for my own personal uses. I wanted to visualise the data myself, to try and get an intuitive understanding of the scale, and possible scale of what is being reported.

Or, in other words, I wanted to know just how worried/scared I should actually be. People were talking about buying guns and the next 20's plague we are 'due for', and the numbers were getting a little lost in translation for me.

So I made this. Even if it ends up totally wrong, I will update it as things develop with the latest and greatest, and i'll always keep that initial prediction of mine that seems so right, right now, on the graph, so any adjustments are clearly visible.

If anyone can give me any information of how to share this without my google profile information being visible, please PM me and I will do that right away.

Firstly, I am lucky to have seen and experienced many things in my life, 2 lovely adult children, travel throughout North America and Europe  with work and military service and some very exciting events. I’ve seen and experienced some very dark and exhausting things as well, marriage (19 years) to my high-school sweetheart ended after she came and it as a lesbian, estranged from my children as we didn’t put my ex-wife, a string of failed relationships and people leaving me.  Current status is living in a 1 room apartment, an on again/off again relationship with a woman that can’t or refuses to commit.  Friends have come and gone, the ones that are still in my network have their own lives and are rarely available. I’ve always been the one to support others, to accommodate their needs and feelings. 

I find no joy in the things I used to enjoy. I work, sleep, do chores and repeat. Aside from going to work or grocery shopping, I rarely leave the house. I don’t have the energy to invest in more relationships only to be let down or ignored. I barely have the energy to get through the current day.

This is only when I know I have more time to sleep, I don’t get unusually angry at my alarm lol Anyway when this happens I become wide awake and get irrationally angry for typically an hour or more. So much so I can’t go back to sleep and I become more angry because I am not able to fall back to sleep. It’s an extremely intense anger.

I try to talk myself down from the anger and I never act out violently or say mean things or anything. I am never able to successfully talk myself down from it. Which also makes me more angry. 

I try to tell myself “just go back to sleep”, “it doesn’t matter”, “this is only effecting you” (if the noise doesn’t persist), “you have to be up in a few hours this is only wasting precious sleep time” etc. I’ve tried counting sheep and forcing myself to think about something else completely. This usually results in me coming full circle and being angry again, even if I can initially get it off my mind. 


I just needed to vent this to someone even if I didn’t explain well because I have tried to look this up before but it’s all just people who are violent or say really mean things, go back to sleep and don’t remember.

Every time my mom tells me i'm a blessing to her despite a rough life, she never seems to miss the point saying that the world is against her and that nobody will *ever*  love her. She always says "" I failed at everything in my life. I'm a loser"" and tons of downer shit like that. Look, I understand you fucking hate your life. You feel like you're fucking hideous that no one wants to fucking be in love with you. You make enough money to buy shit you want but not enough to afford what you need. Whatever the fuck you want to say about yourself that's degrading, sure, say it. I love my mother so much and I'm thankful she kept me but oh my god. 


I feel like I deserve to *not exist at all.* It feels so fucking horrible. Every time she rants about life I try to comfort her as best as I can but I feel like my heart gets crushed every time she mentions how much her life is a fucking mess. What am I supposed to do? Reverse time? You know, mom, if I could, I would. So *you* wouldn't have had to go all through that shit. I love you so much and it hurts me that I'm part of the reason why your life's gone to shit. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry you had to have me. Sorry I'm not the daughter you want. Sorry I'm fucking ugly. Sorry I'm not like my cousins who are literally fucking goddesses. I am so fucking sorry. Sorry I'm a disappointment. Sorry I will never be enough for you.

73,"i don’t know why i was thinking so big picture last night, but i was. so i have a strange “relationship” with social media, specifically instagram and snapchat. when i’m on instagram i just compare myself to all the beautiful girls i see. i want their lavish and romanticized lives. so i decided to unfollow everyone that made me unhappy or feel shity. that helped for a while but i was still doing it on the explore page. i was wasting so much time! then snapchat. well i don’t have the highest self confidence. snapchat just makes it a million times worst. they have these filters that make you have more European features and  even lighten your skin. some of the filters literally make you “prettier” and slim your nose and make you have a better jaw line. that’s a huge problem in and of it self. i just hate taking pictures of myself. so a couple days ago i deleted both apps. so the only form of social media i have is reddit. last year i went social media free for about 5-6 months. it was amazing. i think i’m gonna do that again. i just don’t need social media right now. if anyone is thinking about deleting social media just do it. also i just want to clarify that i’m not blaming my issues with my appearance on social media but it doesn’t help at all.",27Jan2020,1

I'm a hopeless romantic with a taste for indie film so you already see where that's going.

78,"So, I'm a night patrol guard in a small rural Australian town. It's not easy, I have this long list of places I gotta check through 3 times a night, getting them all done is exhausting. Well, last Sunday night was particularly foggy, I mean I could barely see in front of the Ute with high beams on. 

So I'm traveling at 80kmph to a site just outside of town, the speed limit is 100 but again, the fog. So I was going down a small hill and right at the bottom, obscured by the fog to the last second. A fucking koala sitting on it's ass, staring at me with its cold dead beady eyes. 

Now, here's the thing. Security patrol guards are constantly getting in and out of vehicles, so seatbelts are an unbearable pain in the ass. We don't wear them. If this Ute flips I'll be thrown around like a rag doll and I'll be lucky to only get 2 broken legs and some snapped fingers. Well, I swerved to avoid this fucking stupid useless animal, I go off road, I swerved to get back on it, 2 wheels go off the ground, thankfully they fall back down and I'm safe. Now, I've been focussing so much on not crashing the Ute after not hitting the koala that I don't notice the semi truck coming at me. I swerved again and it misses. I pull up, pull out my work log and write in ""0320 - 20 minute break"" and proceeded to have my panic attack at the close call with death I just had.",27Jan2020,1
79,"Not sure if this is right thing to say, but it’s how I feel and if I don’t say anything I feel I may explode inside. I have two very dear friends who I’ve shared everything with and we all love each other deeply. One of my friends, say friend A, has been in depression for about 5 years due to various reasons such as breakups, family problems and general health issues (nothing too serious). Problem is, as much as a nasty and bad friend as I sound it’s been very tiring and exhausting. Friend B and me are in a pickle as we don’t know how to bring up the topic to explain how her depression has been taking an emotional toll on us as we know for sure that she’ll shut down and fall into deeper sadness. She’s already had several suicide attempts, one on the very verge of death but she survived. We have done as much as we could to be there for her, always visiting her and trying to make her feel better by taking her places and reassuring her and just being there for her. However nothing seems to prevail, and while we aren’t professionals it’s just that sometimes we feel frustrated as well. Wow I probably sound very bad right now I’m sorry. It’s just been very hard, esp since I’m going through a lot of issues in my life and to deal with her problems too has just been a lot. I honestly don’t know what to do bc she’s very important to me and I don’t want to lose her. We’re also going on a trip interstate on Wednesday which she said she didn’t want to come (bc she recently had a breakup and doesn’t want to go) but I know if she’s home alone she’s gonna have bad thoughts and I don’t want anything to happen so Me and my friend are trying to ask her to come but it’s not really working.

Is it so? Like, can you fall for a guy only cuz the way he looks at you? by looking i dont mean staring, its not any different from eye contact i make with other people, i just cant describe it.

83,"

So last week, I had a meeting at my child's school with the vice principal and a special educator.  The first one in 7 years since my child is at school and has been bullied for all that time.

I got to the school with my youngest and my husband. When they first came to introduce themselves, I shaked their hand and said thank you (my first wtf moment there)

The meeting went on for about 20 minutes (where I listened, but my eyes kept roaming elsewhere) before my husband had to leave.

When he left, I spoke with the VP and the special educator, told them that if my child gets angry or has excess anger to please let me know because we've observed that kind of behavior at home and normally our child doesn't act that way. I mentioned that I would speak to my child's doctor, just to make sure it was a hormonal imbalance. 

Right before I left, I told them that they might think that I talk alot, that I could be dizzying at times, but everything I do, I do it for my children.
They reassured me that I would not be a bother to them and of more parents took that kind of stuff seriously, we wouldn't be there.

But I still feel like an ass. I feel like I left them with the impression that I'm insecure and that's why my child gets bullied or something.",27Jan2020,1

85,"This is a long one 


So for some background, last year I used to play Minecraft like.. a lot almost everyday, every week. In a server, since I play so much, I got in a guild, became a mod and made a lot of friends. But since the start of new year, I've started to play less, a lot less. Like almost once a week and 1-2 hours per day. The thing is, we have 2 laptops, the first one, the one I usually use is just really slow like, on its own, its pretty slow. But since I play on it a lot, every single time they use it, the laptop is slow, and they complain, and always blames me. Saying that I broke the laptop because I play on it so much. But the thing is, I don't know how they don't understand that the game only makes the laptop slower when its open because, well it only uses RAM when its open. Minecraft isn't a background app so it won't make the laptop slow. 

Now since December, they told me to stop using the laptop because I keep on making it slower. So I did, but doing that.. I became inactive, thus leaving behind my friends, the only people I consider as real friends.

Just this second week of January, a volcano erupted, and since we live like near it, school is suspended for 3 weeks. So I took the opportunity to be online again, and since they don't want me to be using the crappy laptop, I used the fast one, the one that is barely used.

Since they still think that the game is the reason that the laptop is slowing down, they told me that the second laptop is ""Not for Games"". If its not for fucking games then why the hell does my sisters keep using it to play fucking games? Its like they're saying that Minecraft in particular slows down the laptop but other RAM eating games aren't? And also, that second laptop has a problem with it, if it force shut down, the keyboard will disable, so normally, I would connect my gaming keyboard. And my mom kept yelling at me telling me that ""If you connect the goddamn keyboard, the laptop keyboard will not work!! How could you not understand that?!?!"". Like dude you don't know shit, just shut up.

Now they're telling me to use the first laptop forgetting the fucking fact that they told me to not use the first laptop in the first place.

Also, when I finally use the laptop.. they will now complain saying that ""I really needed that fucking laptop but I can't do any work since OP kept playing on it!"". First of all I used the laptop, when no one is using it and also for the past few days or week, they never said anything about needing the laptop, now when their work's due is close.. they're gonna complain like I'm the reason why they didn't do shit.

Like I saw a comment from a post here that says ""Just do what you love to do"". Yeah I love to play the piano but they keep complaining how I'm so noisy, so I don't play it much. I also love playing with my friends but they fucking kept me from it and now I don't even talk to them anymore. I really miss my friends.

Now they're telling me to study since school is almost back. Oh! Sorry, its my fault for not predicting the volcano eruption and not bringing all my books in advance. Since weekends are considered as ""rest days"" students will not bring any textbooks.

Now this has been bothering me for a while now and want to be open to someone. So essentially, I would open to my crush, my best friend. But now I really don't think she's my best friend since when I'm being open to her, she just shows no interest of listening and just says random shit while I'm being open, so midway of telling my problems, when I realise that she doesn't care, I just stop. And since there's no one to be open to.. I go here at reddit.

TL:DR Family kept me from doing what I love and since I love gaming with my online friends, I haven't been able to hang out with them. They keep blaming me for making the laptops ""slow"" and I can't even be bothered to be open to who I considered as my BestFriend since she isn't interested in listening to me being open with my problems",27Jan2020,1
86,"Im 20 and I’m just sat here thinking.. I haven’t had much sleep lately, been going off 1-3 hours in the past 10 ish days. I haven’t got anything to show for all those hours of work except a bit of muscle. It doesn’t matter anyway because my face and back is riddled with ugly discoloured acne and scars. All those hours, I could have put into a skill, like music production, chess, art, anything. Let’s say including travel, it’s been 4 hours a day 6 days a week, for 4 years, that’s 5000 hours. 

I’m just sat here, alone. A gym-cel is what they call it I think. I’m going to university this September and since my birthday is early that month, I’ll be 21, 3 years older than everyone else, and all I’ll have to show for it is that I fill out shirts more than the average person. I realised girls don’t really care about muscle early into lifting but because of my acne it was the only thing I saw thar could increase my attractiveness. I was so wrong. If I’d have just learnt skills, become good at something, developed a healthy vibrant social life, I would be set. 

Fml. I’m 20 years old. I could have sworn I was 16 like a year ago. This shit really turned out as depressing as I thought. Thought things would be magically better by now if I just got a good physique and did well in school. But neither of them things made a difference. Still working minimum wage with straight A’s. Still single with a body a lot men would kill for.

87,"I'm graduating in mid February (I'm in Italy, we can graduate at different times throughout the year) and I have invited my friends (they are 7) both to the actual dissertation and to the ""party"" that will follow, which will actually be a totally non-committing and relaxed drink together, no relatives, just the 8 of us. 
This is a Masters degree, I already got my Bachelors and even then just 3 of them could make it. I have attended every single graduation party (BA, MA) of every single one of them, even those in other cities, except for two cases (once I was abroad and the other one was in Venice, which is rather far and expensive to get to, and my friend didn't expect us to go anyway). I should also add that we all live in the same city, except for one of us who lives 1 hour away. 

Well, I invited them through our whatsapp group and only one of them said she'll be there. I have no trouble believing their reasons not to attend, it's just... One of them said he's tutoring a boy and he has a lesson planned on that day. Another said she is studying. I also work and study, and I had to change my plans multiple times in order to attend their graduations. And I put off my appointments and changed my schedule because I care about my friends and wanted to be there for their special day. I don't blame any of them for declining my invitation, I don't blame them for anything. I am just sad because, evidently, I am not worth the effort for any of them, and this thought makes me feel like shit.

89,"Woke up and went to the gym this morning. On the way I noticed my stomach was feeling off, but since I was already half way there and it was early I didnt pay any attention to it.

Cut to half way through my workout, pure cramps, my stomach was growling. This was going to happen and I had to find a toilet quickly. After running around the building for a solid 5 minutes I found one. 

1. The paper was the thinnest material I've ever seen. As hot molten lava was burning through my ass, I could still see through the paper even when folded 4 times. I prayed 

2. My prayers were answered when suddenly someone pushed a new role of toilet paper under the stall. Hol up, do I say anything ""ay yeah, cheers mate, this clean it up"", I continued to remain silent, hoping the third party didn't pass out from the toxic fumes eminnating from the stall. 

3. Something touched my foot. It was a mop. Some cleaner was ramming a mop under the gap of the stall. Soaking my feet and the preformentioned roll of toilet paper. 

4. Mission completed, stealth mode active. There was no one else in the room when I exited the stall. But when I exited the room, a cleaning lady gave me the dirtiest look I have ever witnessed.

94,"In November, my first real relationship ended. This was also my first girlfriend after I came out as lesbian.

My girlfriend waa the masculine one which made me think I had to be the feminine one. Which isn't the case at all; both people can be masculine or both people can be femeinine.

After we broke up realized something: I'm not comfortable with the way I dress.

I had the occasional piece of 'masculine' clothing in my wardrobe and every time I wore that piece of clothing, I felt more comfortable.

So I got an idea. I'd been saving some money as I didn't have anything i wanted time that I wanted to buy so I just saved it.
My birthday was in December so the only thing I asked my friends and family for waa money. My birthday was also right after Christmas so again, I only asked for money.

The overall total was quite a bit.

I used it all to buy clothing I  _was_  comfortable in.

The thing I'm most happy I bought was a pair of Vans - the classic high top ones. Now I know those aren't necessarily masculine but I feel comfortable in them. 
I smile as I walk around in them, I smile as people ask where I got that awesome shirt, I smile when I someone compliments me on the men's deodorant I've started wearing and I smile when I a pretty girl notices me.

It's important to be comfortable with yourself.
It took me a while to realise that and I'm so happy I did.

95,"I am late 20/s female. I have a full time career and support myself. Due to a very abusive/dysfunctional childhood I had an attachment disorder and in adulthood it manifested as serious anxious attachment. I’ve spent years in weekly therapy and I have due to that I can live like a normal productive adult except with close relationships. I can maintain superficial friendships or acquaintances/ coworkers but anything deeper, I can’t handle it. Again, I’ve spent years in therapy and it’s done wonders to help me function as a normal member of society on the surface

. It’s hard for people to understand. I thought doing lingerie modeling for a brand would help last year with my self hatred but I still thought I was hideous and would apologize to people who had to look at me. I do suffer from deep self hatred but again therapy has helped me not deal with it in destructive ways. Please do not suggest more therapy as I’ve gone weekly to years and they are amazing. However, some damage is beyond repair IMO.  My brain does not look the same on MRIs as a neurotypical due to the chronic &amp; severe trauma at an early age/lack of bonding.

96,"So today I walked past one of those charity worker groups who try to get you to donate and all that shit. I already donate to this particular charity, so I was trying to kind of avoid getting into a conversation, but as I walked by I noticed one of the girls was like insanely cute. I had to walk back that way again a few minutes later to get my bus, so I kind of strategically tried to stay on the side that girl was on, now hoping she’d maybe stop me for a chat (sounds really pathetic and weird having typed it out like that lmfao).

Anyway she walked up to me, and before she could start her sentence I just kind of went ‘sorry, I already donate!’, but she just kind of laughed to herself and went ‘no I wasn’t gonna annoy you with that, I was just gonna say you seem really familiar’ and was asking if we’d met before. I was kind of thrown for a bit of a loop, and we spent a couple of minutes trying to brainstorm what it could have been, but no luck. I had to catch my bus so had to make kind of a quick exit, but honestly I kind of just wanted to stay and keep talking.

Maybe it’s just bias or whatever, but I feel like that was maybe a little flirty. I’m 100% sure she’s never met me (I’m quite recognisable I think) and it was just kind of an excuse for a conversation, I’m kind of kicking myself now for not having followed up more. Honestly not sure what I would have done, but it genuinely feels like I should have asked her if she wanted to grab a coffee or something sometime. Maybe that sounds stupid: we only talked for like a minute or two, but it really seemed like she had an interest in who I was outside of her job, and she was cute as fuck.

98,"Human beings are capable of having widely contrasting opinions. Having our own lived experience to rationalize the way we look at the world, we explain away the inconsistencies trying to find an identifiable box to fit ourselves into. Over time, most of us are guilty of identifying these boxes, and then developing our beliefs. Society has got us believing that these boxes are mutually exclusive, so much so that these boxes are increasingly being used to divide us. People are expected to choose sides, and are expected to die by that choice. Our society is becoming increasingly polarized, with this us vs. Them attitude permeating in the realms of politics, religion, etc. So why is this happening? Are the differences between the boxes so pronounced that we can no longer bridge the gap? Or is it a matter of discourse. I believe it to be the latter.

The death of my idol, Kobe Bryant, really brought this to the fore for me. I loved Kobe. I played basketball because of him. I had his shoes, I modelled my game after him. I tried to replicate his mentality on and off the court. His love of competition, and his drive to be the best were qualities that I wanted to adopt in my own life. I was shattered by the news of his death. At 41, Kobe had already had a legendary playing career, and was just positioning himself to have as legendary a career off the court. He won an Oscar for his short film “Dear Basketball”, which was his goodbye to the game. Although he had spent a few years away from the game, once his daughter GiGi started developing a love for the game, it once again became the focus of his life. Kobe wanted to dedicate himself to the metaphor of sport and all that one could learn from it. He was building a universe to share his stories with the youth of the world. He was an advocate for the game and one of the most revered people in the world of basketball. While he was all this, he was also more.

In 2003, Kobe Bryant settled a civil suit for sexual assault. The criminal case against him was dropped, with the details uncovered in the criminal case not being used in the civil case. I don’t want to go into the details of the case, as there is no way one can come out of this without the perception of one taking sides. What I will say is through the case Kobe reconciled with his behaviour. ""Although I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did. After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.” I am not trying to defend Kobe here. All Im trying to show is his human capacity of reconciliation. He believed his position. Heard new evidence. Took into consideration the context that surrounded the other party in the argument and made a judgment that his initial position was wrong. Does this change what he did? No. Does it make him an absolved human being? No. Does this take away from all that he gave me? Also no.

In 2003, Kobe Bryant was at the top of the food chain. He could have whatever he wanted. Discourse around consent wasn’t as developed. His actions back then are indefensible, and have become even more so in 2020. Kobe used his position of power and influence to take sexual advantage of someone. He was tried for that. He paid for that. He grew after that. He made it his purpose to be an outstanding figure in the game. Personally, I was 13 in 2003, and most of what I came to love Kobe for came after that. It wasn’t even something that crossed my mind when I heard of his passing. But it was in the process of grieving that I was told I was wrong. “Other people died too!”, “he was a rapist!”. Im sorry I wasn’t physically inconsolable for the others on the helicopter. Im sorry, I chose to remember my hero for what he meant to me and not what he meant to you. 

Kobe taught me so much about the game and about life. And he had so much more to give. But even in death, Kobe has taught me an important lesson. Human beings are capable of having widely contrasting opinions. Our opinions are shaped by our environment and out context. Most of us are only capable of looking at the world through our personal lens of rationality and we use this to justify all our actions. A human being shouldn’t be judged in accordance to their moral consistency over the course of their life. Through the course of society, our sense of morality has been tied into religion, into rationalization. But as society grows, its ideas on morality evolve. It is impossible to be morally consistent today. What we can do to measure the legacy of people is their capacity to reconcile with new information. Post 2003 Kobe stayed out of controversy, got better with every time he failed and taught me to keep moving forward. If its alright with all of you, this is how I’m going to remember him.

A year ago at this time, I was at the tail end of an extremely bad relationship, had no future, and was constantly cutting class and getting into it with my mom.  Suicide was on my mind, but I never buckled.  I wanted to keep moving just to tell my mental illness to go fuck itself when I came out on the other side.

Things are never as bad as they seem, I promise all of you.  When the world is weighing on your shoulders, look around you and find stuff that you can look forward to or that makes you smile.

Last night I was really struggling to fall asleep. I kept have problems with strange impulses of fear. Now I am afraid of the dark but am usually fine in my room. I struggle with turning off the hall lights and walking with my back turned, or walking straight into darkness. Multiple times throughout the night I took my phone flashlight and checked the room because I was just scared. Nothing to justify, just straight up fear. This goes on for a few hours from about 12-3 and around three I manage to begin to fall asleep. I recall falling asleep sometime after that point. This is where things get strange. I woke up, but I wasn’t a wake. I’m not sure if this is a type of sleep paralysis but I wasn’t stuck with my eyes open seeing demons or anything like that. I was conscious, I could tell what was going on. I felt weird. I could not move, I could not open my eyes, I felt as if I was floating. I slowly continue to gain more consciousness. And I realize, I’m vibrating. I’m floating and I am vibrating. My fear was then elevated to a level I have never been to before. The most fear I couldn’t even imagine. I wanted to scream. I tried. I could hear it in my head. I tried so hard, I could feel my vocals cords but I could not make them move, I could not open my mouth. I distinctly remember not being able to feel my back on the bed. I could tell I was floating. As I continued to attempt screaming everything went black. As if I went back to sleep. What felt like immediately after the fear woke me up. I was laying on my back, I could feel my body my eyes were open. I check the time and it’s 3:30 and some number. (3:3x) I checked to make sure I wasn’t in a sleep paralysis state I could wiggle my finger wiggle my toes. But the fear was stuck in my body, I couldn’t bring myself to make any major body movements. I could not move my arm to grab my phone for the light. I could not flip the light switch. I could not turn around to check behind me. I did not want to look in any other direction. Eventually I remembered my Apple Watch was next to me. I creep my hand out, as if I’m trying to be sneaky and not get caught to steal my watch off the bed. I take it under the blanket where I can see it and turn on the flashlight and clear the room yet again. Once I realized I was alone I turned on my table side lamp and laid there unable to fall back asleep until I heard my family wake up in the morning. Once I knew I was safe I was able to fall asleep and have had a normal day thus far. 

I’m not sure what to think of this experience I am very confused and any insight as to what happened last night would help me, and help me sleep tonight as well.",27Jan2020,1

Constantly questioning every move of mine, making wrong choices, always feeling stuck and scared to do anything on my own. I get excited at the thought of being alone now. I want to travel alone, live in my house with just my two girls and figure out life with us and figure out who I am. I can feel myself releasing toxicity from my life and finding positives. I am starting to accept my faults and work towards them, I am starting to embrace things that I have been self conscious about, I am breathing life into my children instead of my toxic mindset that I have had for my whole life. I am no longer letting people's opinions get to me or allowing them to treat my like garbage for their own ego. I don't let people's attitudes get to me or alter my moods (huge for me).

I’ll try to explain this situation as best I can without names. Keep in mind I’m a teenage girl who is very overwhelmed by these these things.

       Ok so my friend texted me earlier bc she was in a sticky situation. Her friend had cut himself and she wasn’t sure what to do. With that information I sent her a hotline number for her to give him. Now that we’ve gotten the basics, the guy has a girlfriend and she’s a complete and utter bitch. When my friend told her he was cutting himself she brushed it off and accused him of faking and even cheating on her. The person she assumes he’s cheating with,who’s a mutual friend, talks to him when she ignores him or feels like putting her friends first. He was hurt by this bc he’s always calling and texting her even when he’s spending time with his friends. In conclusion he loves her deeply and cares for her while she treats him like dog shit. She even told my friend that she’s planing on cheating on him. Which we think could cause him to snap and do the unthinkable. My friend can’t get help from her parents bc they are strict and would make her cut contact with him and I live a city over so I can’t do much. What should we do?

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\*Note: This is a raw write of my emotions and feelings on the subject, apologizes for any misspelled words, grammar mistakes, and rambling.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ever since I was a toddler, I have had strong emotions. Emotions so strong that they are overwhelming. Happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and especially guilt. I was a strange child, broke the rules, questioned reality, lied, and all of that up until the time I became self-aware, and truly conscious. I estimate around the time school began.

After that, I only ever had to make a mistake once, and I made it a point to never tell a lie to the best of my ability.

I was so quick to anger, though. Perhaps one of my most vivid memories of my first meltdowns was when I was accused of lying to my parents. No matter how hard I tried to convince them, I was crowned a liar, and at that time, that was the most frustrating thing. It caused me to go supernova, to explode, scream, cry, everything.

I pride myself in never becoming violently angry back then. I’m not a violent person, causing physical pain makes me cringe and retreat into myself.

My emotions got the best of me easily it was like my very personality would change when each emotion. Over time, I have managed to get control of my emotions; even anger, I have gotten a decent hold on compared to the past.

But its not perfect, not at all. It seems like in order to keep anger at bay, I had to compress this overwhelming emotion. I didn’t realize then that it would cause such a catastrophic error in my brain.

You see, in order to gain control of my emotions, I unintentionally developed a more logical side, 2+2=4, no excuses. Clean. Simple. Easy.

This logical side is what is my very downfall when it comes into contact with my anger.

Logic is such a powerful tool. In the wise words of Captain Kathryn Janeway:

&gt;“You can use logic to justify just about anything, that's its power and it's flaw.”

Whenever I’m doing something, something so simple in my mind… and someone does something completely against the most logical course of action- my brain gets instantly defensive.  
 It doesn’t stop and think about what they meant by it, how they perceived it, how they may have had a plan- it does not care- it reacts instantly with a fire generated by my logic, and the bomb that is my anger. Together- they create a nuclear toxic reaction inside of my mind that I cannot stop.

The issue with logic is that it hurts. It can make the smartest person on the planet look like the most uneducated person to have ever existed. Its quick, hot, and sharp.

Its small things, losing in a video game, innocent gestures, trying to get my attention while working… they all create a fire instantly.

I have only been successful in stopping my anger in its tracks maybe 25% of the time. I have been working with therapists and psychiatrists, but even after all of that, years of forcing myself to change, the only thing I cannot shake, I cannot yet erase, is this furry that treats everyone like they are the enemy of a long war.

I have hypothyroidism, and have to take multiple T3 and T4 hormones, which doesn’t help my case at all. It seems like my brain just errors when its met with the data collected from my emotions and logic, and it’s own processing gets stuck and the only thing it knows how to do is react in defense and anger.

I hate that, I hate it so much. I’m almost instantly aware of what I have done. Seconds after my outburst the brain finishes processing the data it got stuck at, and then I’m faced with unimaginable guilt. I get so worked up with myself in that moment that I get angry at myself, and then defensive again, and the loop continues for iterations until I can get control of it.

I have realized that I am not getting any closer to stopping this, to getting control over it, to fulfill my promise to do better to those I have hurt… and I only realized this after my brain pushed me past a point I have never been before, in my worst meltdowns, which are not very often, my pacifist nature has been corrupted, and my hands want to punch, and my body wants to attack. This is a new development, and scares the crap out of me to no end.

I’m sick to my stomach at how I have treated the people closest to me. The pain I have caused with my words alone enough to make me feel as though I am unworthy of their understanding, unworthy to have them in my life.

I have grown to feel guilt every second of every day, for the things I have said, and the anger I have unleashed.   
 Which is why I am so utterly dumbfounded to still display this behavior.

I don’t know how else to explain it, but to say its utterly against my will. I feel like I get locked inside my head while the anger takes over, like a beast finally getting out of captivity. And all I can do is watch.

I have been trying, I have tried harder than I have tried at anything.

I don’t know what else I could possibly do to stop it.

You can only say I’m sorry so many times.

You can only assure them you’re working hard to stop it so many times.

I’m running out of times, something I have been painfully aware of for longer than I think I want to admit.

How can I know I’m this horrible person, and be so powerless to stop it? I feel like I’m being manipulative to the people around me, when I promise I’m trying to work on this. Like I’m lying to them, because obviously I haven’t stopped it yet, so how can I promise such things? I feel like an abusive unforgivable and unworthy person. 

I’m so grateful for the people who have stood by me, but I fear they won’t stand by me much longer- and honestly, I don’t blame them. I don’t want them to…

I keep showing them how grateful I am by constantly hurting them- how is that even possible?

If anyone has any advice, or anything to add to maybe help, or just to give your opinions, I would be grateful to hear/read whatever it is. Thank you for reading!",27Jan2020,1

“The first time I saw you, my heart fell. The second time I saw you, my heart fell. The third time fourth time fifth time and every time since, my heart has fallen.

I stared at her.

You are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. Your hair, your eyes, your lips, your body that you haven't grown into, the way you walk, smile, laugh, the way your cheeks drop when you're mad or upset, the way you drag your feet when you're tired. Every single thing about you is beautiful.

I stared at her.

When I see you the World stops. It stops and all that exists for me is you and my eyes staring at you. There's nothing else. No noise, no other people, no thoughts or worries, no yesterday, no tomorrow. The World just stops and it is a beautiful place and there is only you. Just you, and my eyes staring at you.

I stared.

When you're gone, the World starts again, and I don't like it as much. I can live in it, but I don't like it. I just walk around in it and wait to see you again and wait for it to stop again. I love it when it stops. It's the best fucking thing I've ever known or ever felt, the best thing, and that, beautiful Girl, is why I stare at you.”

My dearest,

&amp;#x200B;

No story is perfect; admittedly I only remember the good parts. Where to begin? I saw you for the first time in 2003, we were in 7th grade together.  I had no idea what love, sex, or marriage was but I knew then, I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you. I fell in love with you the moment I saw you. Your laugh is still infectious. Back then we talked on the phone for hours and hours at a time. Every time we communicate even 17 years later my heart misses a beat. Your voice still changes the same way when you are uncomfortable. I wanted to lose my virginity to you but that didn't work out for either of us. We dated each other and broke up because I held girl 1  and girl 2 hand at a movie theater for some field trip. I was honestly just living in the moment and didn't think anything of it.  Then you broke up with me when you found out. I guess this whole thing is my fault. Maybe if we didn’t break up things would have been different. (wtf) You made a fake AIM account to acting like girl 1 to see if I had a feeling for her. (how do I remember this) Eventually you forgave me but still wouldn’t date again me. We still talked every day. You would have a boyfriend and I would have a girlfriend. We were each other’s secret.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We would be in relationships with other people and cheat on them and make out randomly over the years. My final night in TOWN (2006) your sister let me into your house and told me to go to talk to you. She knew how I felt about you, maybe even more then you did? We started making out and I tried to take off your pants. I never licked a vagina before but I read about it online and was going to try it on you. (I remember reading “women will fall in love with you if you do it right, even if you suck in bed kazza adult reader”) and you said you didn't want to have sex with me. I was hurt because we both did it before with other people and we always talked about doing with each other but it never worked out. Did you love them more then me?  (I don't know why I feel that I have to make you understand how I felt. Why do I need to clarify things? Don't we both already know this? I'm a broken record, Everything you already know right? I know why I’m writing this letter to you. I want you to know that no one will ever love you more then I do. (stalker as hell) I just want to be with you forever. It's all I've ever wanted. IT won't happen. Was this whole thing was me being pulled along? ( your dad left your family, was I just comforting? )

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There were other girls over the years but none of them compared to you. None of the next girls will compare to you.

&amp;#x200B;

Ghetto Translation: BOTCH you got me DUCKED  up.

&amp;#x200B;

I had to move away for disciplinary issues with my father. The 2nd time you broke up with me I got into a really bad fight with my brother. My dad was very upset with me. I think it dawned on him that he didn’t really know me and, that scared him. I tried to ponder of ways to stay. Could I run way?  I tried bargaining, begging, even volunteered to go to catholic school. Nothing was going to work on him. All that mattered was being close to you. When I moved to MIDWEST. We would still talk on AIM all the time and we even called each other for major holidays. I would stay up late on AIM to talk to you after you got home. ( 5  hour time difference , After we talked on the phone it was impossible for me to sleep.) (I've memorized your number even till today)

&amp;#x200B;

2008:You were supposed to move to MIDWEST DOWN and go to GOOD SCHOOL IN SAID MIDWEST TOWN. You even came up here and viewed schools. I thought how cool it would be to share a crappy apartment together and we could finally be together. (You would look so sexy in winter clothes. I always wanted to see you in stockings near a fireplace. ) The thought of picking out furniture was amazing. There’s no Ikea in YOUR TOWN and I’m a real slut for home décor!

&amp;#x200B;

I drove you around town and even showed you how to throw change at a toll. You were oddly really happy about that. (Good innocent memory) We had sex in my mom's car. I remember your beautiful shoulders and the way your hair smelled. Your sex face is imprinted on my mind. You let me cum inside of you and that was the happiest I've ever been in my life. Could making love with you be like that every time? That was the first time I made love to anyone. I felt so close to you I wrote ""wow"" on the foggy windows. I could tell that you didn't really enjoy it as I did. Or maybe I'm just remembering it differently now? We took a picture together probably the only one we ever took. It's lost to time now.  But it was us kissing. Driving you to your hotel I told you "" I love you full name I always will forever."" you replied with a broken voice "" I love you too."" I asked you how you felt about me. After sex vibes are usually the most honest and venerable. You said "" you're the person that will always be there for me."" I didn’t know how to tell you I wanted to marry you. I should of, maybe things would have been different.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Sometime later you told me you were not going to be moving to MIDWEST CITY. I was completely flattened, devastated and destroyed. Was I not comforting enough? Am I naïve? Can't we start a life together? I think culturally I'm just different than you.  I follow my heart, I’m driven by my heart. I try to get everything I want. If it takes 100 times to win I’ll do it. I’ve always wanted you. In my fit of anger, I told you were going to be a loser her whole life for not leaving HOMETOWN. Deep down I figured you'd meet some guy in college and marry him. I apologize for saying that. You were always super smart I just was so damaged.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry Sorry Sorry.

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks later I joined the army. (03/07/2008)We didn't talk for a while maybe 6 months or a year. You text me asked me how I was I can't remember what I said but I gave a half-ass response to like ""good and you?"" I had a  serious girlfriend at the time and she was great. I was still so heartbroken I couldn’t deal with you.

&amp;#x200B;

2010: I was getting deployed. I went to WHERE WE MET to visit HOMIE and hopefully see you. I text you and told you I was getting deployed and I wanted to have dinner. You literally told me to never talk to you again. I know we both kind of faded away from each other but didn't you worry I might die? Didn't you worry about me? Fast forward to pre-mobilization training. (The moment of my life where I realized my own mortality) One of the final check out stations was wills and life insurance payouts.  How do I want to leave with the world? I left you 50k of my life insurance. I wrote you a death letter although I lost it. Pretty much it said, "" I love you, I wanted to spend my life with you,  the night we spent together was the best memory of my life. I was a teenage boy when I met  and now I’m a young man and my feelings for you have never changed. I'm sorry that you are reading this, I didn't want this to be our last correspondence, I hope you have a happy and full life. You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be"" (Iris is my favorite love song)  


I didn't tell you about the 50k till maybe 5 years later. I again was heart  broken and couldn't deal with you.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2012-2018: Things after that were touch and go for a while. We would talk hot and heavy annually or semi-annually, exchanging nudes and me buying you underwear you modeling them for me but we always lived on 2 different sides of the earth. You would get in a serious relationship and stop talking to me. It was never the right time, never the right place.  I should have done more. I should have moved back to PLACE and gone to STATE COLLEGE. You always make me want to be the best version of myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I got married to someone. I tried to call you before I got married just to talk. You didn't pick up. It doesn't matter I got divorced 1.5 years later anyway. Even after my divorce, I kept saying the same things to you “I love you, you’re the love of my life” I’ve never felt so undervalued.  I called you once when I was on the PLACE and told you I think I was getting a divorce. I was so alone and needed a friend but you didn’t pick up again.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward the year is 2020. We had drinks and a friendly conversation last week. My Dad and stepmom are retiring and want to move back to PLACE. We hadn't seen each other for 12 years. I text you and asked if you wanted to get a friendly drink. To my absolute surprise, you said yes! We agreed to meet at some hotel. You were late in true LOCAL fashion. I was an hour early so I could scope out the place and try and get the best seats for us. I wanted everything to be perfect. I was so nervous. I didn't have the right clothes, LOCAL formal wear does not suit me well. I like ties and doc martins. I couldn’t find any cologne anywhere!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You snuck up on me. I was practicing my opening line but I forgot it when I saw your awkward smile. “heeeeyyyy” My heart sank and I was so blissful to see you. There was no where else, I wanted to be in the world than right there with you. We sat down and caught up we both acknowledged how insane this whole thing was. I saw your ring. I was happy for you. You said you dated him off and on for 5 years. I asked what that meant and you wouldn't give me details. You said if I was a week earlier if you weren't engaged then we would be in a hotel together. (I hate traveling during the holidays. Is that why didn’t we make love, because I hate flying during the holidays? ) Heartbroken but happy, Bitter DUCKING sweet. You tried to comfort me and I tried to help you with your UPCOMING marriage.  “You know being nervous is normal.” I thought to myself “this is true love, giving Name marriage advice.” I had a few more shots of tequila and the reality of the situation hit me hard. This was probably the last time you are going to see her. Tell her everything, I went into full confession mode unfiltered. I thought if I could just explain everything, explain it all then you would rethink everything? Insanity is the definition of trying to the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. You showed me your shoulders. I was taking in the little things, the way you laughed, the way you moved, the way you conversed. I told you a long time ago you’re imperfections are what make you beautiful. I tried to kiss you but you wouldn't let me. Then you did. It was magical, you have the softest lips. For a brief second, you were mine again. For a brief second, we were one. We walked around the hotel and you kept saying you had to go. I kept trying to stall you. "" please be with me, please marry me, we can explore the world together make love on every continent. I want to wake up to your face for the rest of my life, we will be so happy together""

&amp;#x200B;

If I just had another minute maybe you could fell what I felt?

&amp;#x200B;

As the night drew to an ending I felt I was being a d bag. I should have been a gentleman and respected your boundaries. I convinced you to drop me off at my hotel even though I could of walked a quarter-mile away. Every second is preciouses with you. I asked you to tell me "" I love him, he's the love of my life and I’m going to have his children."" You did and you were super annoyed I was taking up your time. It was soul-crushing but I needed to hear it. I needed to know. Now I know that this is over. "" I gave you a final kiss and said “I love you full name""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

(When I got back to my room my dad was surprised I was back so early. I told him you were engaged and everything else. He knew about you, not all the details but he knew enough. He said you should of told me. He said this is actually common that girls need closure before marriage. I agreed and decided to drink and call an army buddy of mine in Israel. We had a good conversation about life and loss. He said he never felt any connection to anything in life before he moved to Israel. He said he felt close to god. I wonder what that's like.)Was this a sign from god?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You text me the next day saying you would like to meet again in a few years. I was annoyed because I don't want to be in the friend zone and I told you that, I never want to be your friend, I could never be your friend, but how can I turn my back on our relationship? I replied yeah I guess we can compare kids photos the next time.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I flew the PLACE a day later. Summited MOUNTAIN (slight altitude sickness) and left you behind. You were going to be fine. Not only fine but you were going to flourish.  As far as I can tell you’ve never failed at anything. Our lives were just never going to work out and that was fine. Honestly, I felt like you/we just needed closure.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You text me again 1 or 2 days later saying you've been thinking about me. I said please stop saying that to me it gives me false hope. Do you understand I have feelings?  You said to call you. My heart was beating so fast I didn't know what to say. Was this ""the breakthrough?"" My apartment isn’t crappy anymore! Runaway to MYTOWN? Anywhere in the world I’ll take you.  I asked you what you meant by ""thinking about you"" and you said, ""you know just thinking about you."" I was pissed and said ""is this how you communicate with people?"" you said ""yes. "" I was so confused. My phone disconnected because I was in the jungle. I called you on google voice aka "" my batline. "" You wouldn't pick up and said ""I drank tonight I shouldn't of text you""

I replied ""DUDE WTF. BRO NEVER CONTACT ME AGAIN. YOU'RE THE CLOSEST TO HEAVE THAT I'LL EVER BE YOU'RE MY LOVE DRUG AND SMELL LIKE AN ANGEL PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE.""

&amp;#x200B;

Why I said bro and dude when addressing the love of my life I'll never know. She hasn't spoken to me since then and I just don't know what to do. I talked to a good female friend of mine. She said girls like that give all girls a bad name. Girls who string nice guys along. Move on, if she wanted you, then she would do something about it.

Someone hurt/raped you, you never told me the details, but I want to hurt them still. Are you ok? No one should ever have to go through that. I’m sorry that happened to you.

&amp;#x200B;

I always say your last name when I saw I love you. In my mind when we got married I wanted to say “ Now I love you YOUR FIRST NAME MY LAST NAME. 20 year plan how’s the foreshadowing!

you asked about my ex-wife: I didn't tell you she cheated on me because I didn't want to look weak. the debt and abortion stuff was true though

&amp;#x200B;

It's just me trying to be with you, anyway possible. I've tried every technique. I pulled out my badge, Maybe authority will work? I tried being funny, I tried being cute. Tried being silent. I tried  reminded you of Ross and Rachel, Charlie and the Waitress, Forrest Gump and Jenny.  Eventully they all got together it just took lifetimes.

There's nothing left to say. You're my love drug. You make me feel good but I get nothing in return.

Time machine please. Go back and fix everything.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want answers. Not in a confrontational way, just for clarification purposes. Who am I to you?

&amp;#x200B;

I looked into getting a transfer to  YOUR TOWN yet again.  The only reason I would come back was for you. I thought you know maybe I have a year to convince her to not marry this guy. I went into a deep dive of crunching numbers and condo hunting. I didn’t really like the amount of house I got for the money. I reached a cool middle ground. BUY A BOAT!

Turns out a 15-year boat for 80k-120k boat is better then buying a condo. (917$ for 120k boat harbor fees 300$) 1500$ a month and we can sail around the islands for fun. How cool would that be? Literally rocking the boat! I would take such great pictures of you. The sun and wind in your hair. Topless photos on the imaginary boat in a captains hat.

127,"My Experience with Kobe

It’s incredibly difficult to write this. I’m still shaking and crying, completely dumbfounded and utterly devastated that this has happened. But I want to speak my own experience with Kobe.

I use to be obese, freshman year of high school of which was my peak, capping in at around 320 pounds. I hated myself, I hated people, I hated my life, I hated everything...except basketball. I started watching years prior because of Kobe. My dad and I grew up watching nothing but the Lakers, especially when we lived in California. Moving to the east coast and back twice was difficult, because I knew it’d be tougher to see Lakers games. Eventually, we were able to see every one of them and it’s therapeutic for me. I gained my love for the Lakers, not just from my dad, but from the man wearing 24. Every time I watched him play, I imagined being exactly like him one day. I knew it was impossible because of my obesity, but I dreamt it still. One day, I was watching an interview of his and an epiphany struck me. I realised that I needed to fix my weight. His words inspired me to start doing something and now, as a senior in high school, I’ve lost 150 pounds total, and gained about 30 back in muscle. He’s the reason I did it. He’s the reason I started working out, lifting, running, eating healthy and watching what I put into my body. He inspired me to do all of this. But he also inspired so much more. 

I was also in an extremely abusive relationship that I felt trapped in. I was abused sexually, physically, mentally, and emotionally by my ex. But note that...ex. I broke the cycle of pain because of Kobe. I gained the confidence to finally break it. Kobe instilled into me a sort of motivation and passion that I never had before. His words, his ideals, his personality, all of that and then some was just...incredible to me. He inspired me to pick up a basketball and start playing. Whilst I’ll never be even a fraction of the player he was, I do everything I can to go as hard as I can, even when it hurts because that’s what Kobe taught me. 

My dream, the top of my list of things I want to do before I die, trumping everything was to be able to just have a conversation with him, no matter how long or short it would’ve been. I feel like I lost a family member yesterday. Kobe is my hero, the man who inspired me more than anyone to not let pain define me, and motivation to be the best version of myself possible. I loved him like a second father, even if he didn’t know me, and I know he had love for me and the millions of others like me that he helped inspire and ultimately change forever. I will never be who I was before I found Kobe, because that man changed me for the better. I have had, for the longest time, a shrine for him, an ode if you will, statues, shoes, jerseys, pictures, everything man. I can’t believe he’s gone.

I have a lot of love for Kobe, and I hope that Heaven is real because I know he and his daughter GiGi are there right now if it is. He was a wonderful human being, an amazing father, and the greatest player to ever touch a basketball.

I can’t do much, but I send my ultimate and deepest condolences for everyone affected, Vanessa, their 3 other girls, and the families of the others who’s lives were lost. I’m heartbroken man. I still can’t believe it’s real, but I know that Kobe would want me to wipe my tears and keep pushing to be the best me, and then some. 

Thank you for saving me, Kobe.",27Jan2020,1

135,"Today, I am going to continue my thoughts about healthcare. As I reflect on how ineffective the healthcare system is in the US (and probably in many other places), it is easy to see some simple connections. Before health insurance became a requirement (and people actually have to pay taxes on it if they are uninsured even a small portion of the year), the world of health care and their general charges were a whole different story. Since the initiation of mandatory health insurance, the out of pocket expenses has undoubtedly skyrocketed. Recently, my employer decided to change insurance providers, which has been a major change for my colleagues and everyone is looking at a family deductible of close to $7000 out of pocket before any benefits kick in (and that is for in-network services!!!!)...and that is an annual deductible! Could it possibly make having that insurance worthwhile??? While emergencies do arise, for the most part, you could put that money that you are forking out each month into a savings account for a rainy day and probably be better off. If a large number of people starting saying NO and not paying these premiums, insurance companies would have to change their policies...as would the healthcare system as a whole.
But what we really need to get down to is why these numbers are so high. If you all know anything about how a monopoly works, then it should become rather clear. Basically, the requirement to have health insurance created a monopoly for insurance providers...a captive audience, if you will. That being said, it opened doors for health care providers to put whatever price tag they wish on their services, the insurance company ""capping"" that value so as to appear to be within a reasonable range, and then coming to you with a much lower value (which remains insanely high since it is a percentage of the original charge), and present it to you as a miracle they have worked in your favor. Now if we let reality kick in a bit, the value you are supposed to pay for the services rendered is undoubtedly astronomically higher than it would have been had the insurance not be required since the limits to how much one can afford are also limited, but in this case, having insurance, you now have the privilege to pay more.
You might be able to figure out that with such high costs and bills that are out of this world, many people end up delinquent and health care facilities may never get the fees they require and thus they depend on the choice few who wish to maintain a clear conscience and pay their bills on time, even if that means forgoing aspects of their existence they have worked hard to achieve. Now, as I mentioned in my previous post, negotiation is always an option and if you are going to work toward paying these fees, a large discount should be one of your goals. Interestingly, the facilities will often offer you a rather large discount, which also means that they have a HUGE margin over what they actually charge you...and once again, they will make the exception out of the goodness of their hearts.
Just to relate the concept of this margin, I was once traveling in Turkey and if you know anything about Turkish negotiation, they will never be at a loss, regardless of how much you walk away feeling like you got the good end of the deal. The health care folks are the same.
So the big question, beyond doing your part to get the best deal for you under the current conditions, is how can we change this to make it more reasonable for all? Well, I believe it comes down to having reasonable prices for the goods that are offered. If you ever look at an itemized bill from a hospital, you will see that they charge you several dollars for a piece of gauze...a quick trip to the local pharmacy or Walmart will get you a whole box of it for a fraction of the price, so everything is inflated. This goes back to the idea that many people won't pay their bills, so those that do have to pay the difference (fair, right???). So, make the prices charged reasonable and more people are more likely to put forth an effort to pay their debts and everyone comes out ahead. Gouge people and they will find every way possible to wiggle out of it. Survival is the name of the game.",27Jan2020,1
136,"I haven't spoken to my father since July of 2018. I requested he not do something around me, he did that thing around me, and as a result I suffered; when I confronted him about it he reacted poorly. I cut off communication since he clearly had no desire to respect my boundaries, and I've been happier as a result. 

However, he's started reaching out to the people adjacent to me, trying to get information on me, and I really don't want that to continue happening. I'm trying  to psych myself up into texting him, but I have no idea what to say to him, especially since my life is objectively better without him in it. 

Still, two years past everything, the argument that led to this feels trivial. I don't believe I am in the wrong, but I regret letting things get to this point. Maturity probably means sucking things up and being direct with him about my problems with him, giving him a chance to change -- even though I know he won't take it.

But goddamn do I not want to talk to him again.",27Jan2020,1
137,"My husband and I bought our house about a year ago and moved into an area knowing it was a bit of a family area. We are probably ~3 years away from having kids of our own. 

We moved in and found out there were 4 kids on each side of us. We occasionally got annoyed with some minor stuff (finding their frisbees in our backyard, sometimes running through our front yard, occasional noise) but it was bearable and we never said anything to either neighbor. One family moved out a new family has since moved in, they only have 2 kids. Well, the noise has been an absolute nightmare since they moved in. I guess the last neighbors kids spent a lot more time inside because these kids are constantly running around the front yard and backyard screaming and making noise. We have double pane windows and we can still hear the screaming from all rooms of our house sometimes. They are about 4 and 7 years old and also have friends over very frequently. To make matters worse they put a trampoline, swing, and fort in the backyard, all three of which are right next to our fence so they are often jumping around and can see us over the fence. There have been times when we've been our backyard and the kids will climb into the fort and scream ""hi"" at us over and over. Our city has fence limitations so we cannot have a fence higher than 6 ft. If they're not in the backyard they're in the front playing basketball and dribbling in front of our windows on the sidewalk. 

It was never like this with the last neighbors or the neighbors on the other side of us, despite them having 4 kids. We are incredibly frustrated, especially as we just spent $5k on an outdoor patio for the back which we feel we cannot use most of the time because there is no peace and quiet. We also are not sure there is really anything we can say to the neighbors.. I recognize in this day and age it's hard to encourage kids to spend time outside instead of staring at a screen all day. So I can appreciate that as frustrated as we are. But is there anything we can say about the noise? Or do we just suck it up?",27Jan2020,1
