Hey guys! I am a 16 yo from Albania. This school year hasn’t been easy on my country due to devastating earthquakes and now the coronavirus lockdown. School has already become pretty deficent due to a lack of organization. Studying is pretty hard right now and i feel out of place. 

When i was young i used to live in Greece. At the age of 12 i came back home and pursued an international school, finishing with my igcses. Then i decided to flee the country and follow an international education abroad. 

I went to Germany and got enrolled in a british school there. However i got deported back 3 months later. I had started studying a levels there. When i came back i unfortunately had to chase ib as it was the only international school which i could go to right now. 

Then all the misfortunes mentioned in the first paragraph occurred. It found my country to be unprepared. I wasn’t able to study. Things got eventually stabilized but the problem is that being in albania, my school is disoriented just like the country. 

Life here is becoming more troublesome every day. I wish to retry again abroad. Should I redo year 12 as I feel like i lost a lot?",11Mar2020,1
3,"I really don’t know how to describe this but just randomly like 2 weeks ago this began. Swallowing began to feel manual and unnatural. The food would sometimes slowly slide down and I would have to move it back to the front of my mouth. I ended up having to chew my food more (and I still do.) which was exhausting. It’s gotten better when I’m left alone and not out eating, but when I am it comes back. It’s like all of the talking and noise makes it harder to swallow, like that manual feeling of swallowing. I need some help as this problem is beginning to become annoying as hell and I honestly dread every meal",11Mar2020,1

(Bubbly Tone of voice as I said) and then she said ‘ ok well do you know how to conduct yourself on an interview"" while looking at me pleasantly with furrows eyebrows  , (see I’m very shy and  quiet) I said ‘yes’ she went on to say (she used her hands as gestures in motion to what she was saying)  ""ok, well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes....make sure you get a shave. make sure you cut your nails. make sure you do you're hair up all nice and that"" (in a voice between a mix of bubbly and assertive) then she paused a bit looking at her computer and then said ""and make sure you put some aftershave on as well, for the girls make sure it's men's"" then she burst out laughing. I just smiled with it. She said it nicely judging by a laugh at the end but idk. i wasn't near clean shaven at the time of the appointment tbh) but always was previous appointments. she sent me an email the next day about it saying about what I need to take with me to the interview and at the bottom it had underlined ‘please dress smartly’ and ‘good luck’

No Facebook or snapchat,ig etc. Everytime I gain the courage to actually sign up for one of those free dating apps i always wuss out and end up never making a profile.

It's been difficult to even maintain friendships due to my anxiety and depression stemming from things that happened when I was in the military which left me with PTSD. It's gotten to the point even going out in crowds sometimes leaves me physically sick.

8,"So, I thought I would seek feedback/advice since I feel a lot different from many people. I’m in my 20’s and I still feel like I’m this grown ass 10 year old (weird way of putting it). I guess I mandatorily listen to the same music, read the same books and still have the same interests I had 12+ years ago etc. I’m not sure if I’m just nostalgic or regressing because of trauma? I get called a boomer a lot or weird because I look and sound like I just came out of 2007 lol. I also don’t have many friends as I am anti-social and feel (kind of) superior with my interests etc. **please don’t judge** :/ I’m just always sad and scared to move forward.

10,"Before you all tell me to go seek help and life is worth living and all of that... I'm not suicidal. I'm not about to jump off a bridge. But as many older people whose best years are behind them feel, at some point you have to face your mortality and the path towards the inevitable.   


I've lived a fantastic life with a lifetime of wonderful memories. Two kids with whom I'm close, both happily married and financially independent. And, as I approach the twilight in my life, seeing what's changed in the world... as I type this, I'm looking down at a courtyard full of young people, all wandering around like zombies, staring into their phones. I'm reading about our politicians on all sides of the spectrum, both here and elsewhere, and the incomprehensibly awful way they manage their affairs, and the effect that has on us.  


I'm sure the world will be ok eventually. This virus will get a vaccine, better leaders will be elected, and people will realize that what's all around them is a better interaction that their little phone.   


But I'd have to live to 120 to see that, and I won't. I guess I'm tired. And going out with the virus gets my estate divied up sooner, get my life insurance cashed in, and the benefits of all of that gets used today by people and organizations who need it more than me. And I get to end a life where the negatives of aging and the world around me are only getting more pronounced on a daily basis.",11Mar2020,1

15,"We had a short fling that lasted for 6 months. Unfortunately for me, I was in a very bad state before that and her being there was like a salvation from my suicidal thoughts. And so I found myself falling too hard and she didnt (to her Im more like a passing crush)

She insisted on staying friends which I reluctantly accepted because I cant bear too lose someone so precious to me.

Fast forward 4 years later, I found myself still getting the occational ache in my chest everytime I see her social media feeds. Eventhough I gave a long ass text telling her how I'll try to be friends sincerely and not because I used to have feelings for her, I cut her off again. I deleted her number as well so this might be the last time. Blocked her in every socmed too.

I did this not because I cant bear the pain (because tbh it no longer hurts as much as it used to) but because I felt like I have to close the door. She's like the old chapter of my story, reminding me of the miserable past I used to have (I had experience of being molested and robbed when I was a child. I was also emotionally neglected by my parents which caused me to be scared of people). 

Now Im feeling a bit guilty. It is not her fault that she didnt feel as strongly as I did. Though I cant help but feel betrayed (and grateful at the same time) by fate for putting her into my life, and taking her away. 

I finally established a dream of being an automotive engineer with an eye on working overseas. Cutting her off was not out of hatred to her but more of a personal thing. I want to chase a dream and I cant let the past to stay. I guess this is moving on? I guess it is.",11Mar2020,1

I haven't taken a bath in *years*, like, since I was a kid, I've just been showering, but it was so refreshing and really helped clear my head, definitely made my night.

How do people make friends? Like, good long friendships that you feel nothing but positive emotions about?

How do you just *talk*?

I guess I am making a few more friends lately, even though I’m usually never the one who initiates, but so much of it feels fake for some reason, even though these people feel genuine.

I’m also kind of lonely in the sense that I haven’t really crushed on someone since December, which is when that crush rejected me, and my one best friend out of two somehow landed an incredible boyfriend already. This is probably stupid since I’ll have like another 60 years in my life to date and explore, but I still feel kinda lonely.

I’ve been feeling really depressed for a few months. It’s only been getting gradually worse. I see a therapist but only every three to four weeks for like an hour at a time. I clash with my family all the time. I feel like I’m losing that best friend. I feel like I’m being cold to everyone and that I feel really confused as to what’s right and wrong in certain situations.

36,"I've talked about this with friends before and even made a few posts about it before but here we go again.

I've recently turned 20 years old and am still feeling the impact of a relationship that I've been out of for over 5 months. I met this girl in high school and started dating in my senior year. The first year of the relationship was very nice and we would spend almost everyday together. I didn't know her very well before we started dating an I really rushed into this relationship. 4 months in problems started to come up. It was more and more difficult to communicate and in hindsight, we really didn't have much in common. I should've noticed this and broke up then and there but she was beautiful and very popular and I was too worried about what other people would think and so we stayed together. i would do things that I thought would be funny or make me happy and every now and again she would respond with something along the lines of ""don't do that, that's embarrassing."" Again, instead of breaking up with her I said OK what can I do to make her happier and so I gradually started to mold myself into this person that was the perfect image of what I though she wanted. 2 YEARS INTO THE RELATIONSHIP, I was incredibly depressed and still am to this day. I finally broke up with her but I don't feel much better. I sacrificed my personality for this girl and now I didn't have the girl or the personality. Its been almost half a year since we broke up and I still feel depressed. I'm afraid of seeing old friends because I'm afraid that they won't want to hang out with me because I'm not as funny or interesting as I used to be. I'm also afraid of trying to meet new people because I feel like my social default is to just mirror the personality of the person I'm talking to. I don't have a sense of self and just want to be happy and confident again. Has anyone gone through anything similar?

I said to myself a few months ago that I need some good news soon. I haven't had any at all. How can I be happy? How can I just stop being sad and hopeless for 5 minutes? How can find something to give me hope that it'll get better. My friends tell me they've given up trying to help because I'm too miserable.

44,"I know this problem isn’t something I deal with individually, and that it is common among many that they don’t know what to do for their future. The problem is, I feel like I’m experiencing this way to early. To start this off, I’m young. I’m only 13 years old, going onto 14, but I’m not gonna act like I’m older by saying that. I’m flat out a new kid, 13 years old. I’ve wondered about my future before, but it’s always troubled me intensely. I usually refuse to talk about it when it’s brought up and it seems to me I overthink it. I haven’t really had a problem with it in a while.

what I want to do is looked down upon. I can’t even talk about it because it’s something people hear and immediately jump to conclusions about (it’s not a pornstar, trust me). Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been into acting and music. That’s the part where people turn away. It’s not for the idea of fame. It’s the idea of doing it for myself. The idea of being able to express myself. The things that I have trouble with even though I’m only 13 years old. I’ve been in theatre camps, scored lead roles, and am in theatre class. I’m also in band which I’ve been doing for 3 years as a first chair baritone/euphonium. I’ve gone to all-district and have gotten superiors in solo and ensemble performances. I truly believe I am good at it. I also enjoy playing piano and writing lyrics/poems/journal entry’s, which I’ve been keeping for nearly 140 days (I know people do this, I’m nothing special)

One of my close friends who I talk about music often was just recently admitted into a high school of the arts for creative writing. You have to try out to be accepted. I feel very close to this dude. I was super proud of him and congratulated him damn well. I know he’ll have a good time. We talk often, he’s in my theatre class, he introduced me to Tyler, The Creator, and I introduced him to Rex Orange County. We enjoy each others music taste and have continued. And now he’ll be gone to another school. Another close friend is trying for art at the same school. A few of my other friends will be trying for it in tenth grade. I just feel even more alone than how I’ve been feeling for the past 3 years. 

I’ll be going to the normal high school not achieving what I want to do while each of my friends will be together and pursuing the arts in music, visual, and writing. I want to give up. I’m stuck in this horrible place of waiting for next year. The idea of drifting farther and farther from the people I’ve grown to love. So I’ve broken down. I’m not sure what to do or where to go. Sure, I want to try out, but I feel held back. What’s even crazier is that I’m completely situated. I’m a good student, in honor classes, set up for the AICE program and in NJHS. 

My situation seems perfect. I believe I’m good at music and the proceedings of it, and I know I’m a damn good student. It feels like everything is cut out. But the future could not look dimmer. I feel like I’m about to enter real life when I’m only going into high school. College scares me so much, being by myself scares me, High school scares me. The hell else is there to be scared of.

I know this isn’t the perfect place to share this, but I just need to say something. Everybody has their story, mine just seems exceptionally long. If you did read all the way through, thank you for at least understanding. If you have any idea where else I could talk about this that would also be amazing. Thank you.",11Mar2020,1

Listened to it for the first time last night and the whole night and all of today I've had it on repeat. I listened to it probably 10 times today.


It's just my tastes but it's so rare for an album to hit me like this. I've teared up at how good the production is and how beautiful it all is and lyrics



I liked Lorde back when Pure Heroine was new but I hadn't listened to Melodrama. But I've been a big Jack Antonoff fan lately with Norman Fucking Rockwell and Lover. And I knew I used to be a Lorde fan so I listened. 



I think it's the rare alignment of really amazing art coming into your life at just the right time. I related a lot to some of the lyrics like Liability, and some of them were just so good. The whole thing captures so much of being this age in this time I think. The damn loneliness of the whole thing. 



So this has blown me away. I try to listen to as much new (to me) music as I can but it's rare for an album to hit me like that. Maybe even if you don't like or don't know this album you can relate to that about some other album / work of art",11Mar2020,1

The coffee shop closed so we then went to the pub and ended up staying there for hours too talking. It was really lovely. He said he was initially nervous to meet me but it’s been really lovely and I’m a nice person to be around. I felt like he definitely could’ve left earlier but didn’t because he enjoyed taking. 

As we went to leave he hugged me and said he had an awesome time and he’d like to do it again.

Now, this would only work after you have been infected. I dont think this could benefit in preventing it. If you take an alcoholic beverage like tequila, vodka or whikey, vaporize it and then inhale it, that should kill the corona virus right?

67,"GF asked me to post this. It is written by her. We are both 23, if its relevant. Posted elsewhere too.

I'll try keep this short and sweet. I've put myself in a really tight spot and i think i have a rough idea how it will turn out but as a last resort i'll ask for advice here.

First of all; the essential info: i first started at my job only a mere 5 weeks ago, i have had my 10 week holiday planned since June last year, an abrupt redundancy saw me unemployed from the end of December until i found work in my current role and they did ask me in my interview if i had any holidays planned. Which (i know, i know) i straight up lied about and said; no. 

The management and coworkers of this (office) job are very progressive. They have a much more laid back attitude about work than i expected, which makes this more difficult for me.

My plan going into working for this company was to have a temporary low paying job to keep the funds coming in for my SO and i, so when the time came for the holiday i could give them my two weeks and cut ties. I wasn't entirely prepared for me to actually really enjoy the job, which, has since become a reality. I also have a very good relationship with my management team and co-workers. And they all regularly hint at me working with them for an extensive amount of time (the guilt is paralyzing).

The dilemma being: i'd love for the company to keep me on after 10 weeks but i know my chances are low. My BF thinks i should give 4 weeks notice as a courtesy but i worry that i will get fired. I know its a bit ridiculous but we need the extra weekly income right up until we leave. I thought 3 weeks would be the perfect amount of time but he thinks it would be even more damning in my case to give such short notice. 

I would love some advice on how i can possibly word this to my supervisor and also a good timeframe for breaking it to them. I know i'm an asshole, but i'd appreciate any witheld judgement for some help in the matter.

I will add: My contract does not have any mention of this issue so legal repercussions are not necessarily a worry.

TIA",11Mar2020,1
69,"She works in an open plan office space. She hangs out with the Italian crew (30 people). Of that 30, 14 of them went to Italy in the past week to visit their friends/family (herself included). One of them came back with the virus, and he was going to work for a full week before he was officially diagnosed. 

The office has been shut down for a whole day for deep cleaning. However, the damage is already done. My flatmate couldn't get out of bed on Friday, because of a mysterious illness. Due to the language barrier, I'm led to believe that she had a particularly bad migraine. She is perfectly fine now. 

But I was already worried about this in the first place. My other flatmate is carrying on like normal, going to work etc. Thankfully, I'm on annual leave this week, so I have some time to think about an action plan. 

Considering that my possibly infectious flatmate is a bit messy around the house, should I self-isolate? Should I tell my workplace? Should I work from home? Should I tell my boyfriend (who stayed over on Friday night, that he should self-isolate)?

70,"They were actually some type of coveralls, poofy with wide bands of primary colors. That slick synthetic material that cheap Halloween costumes are often made from. High school in the 90s was a dark time. Not in that foreboding things-are-awful sense, but in fashion. Grunge was just that, devoid of anything truly eye-catching or overbearingly standoutish. So the day I saw her walking down the breezeway with her idiosyncratic confidence was one that has stuck in my mind for the last quarter of a century. 

I had never seen her before. Or at least I had never noticed until she wore the pants. I later found out her name was as unique as her fashion sense. A friend of a friend had a class with her and asked me if I knew the girl with the weird name. He figured her parents must be hippies. 

One day at lunch she sat at the same table as us. Our conversations crossed, but that was the only time I ever really spoke to her. She would sometimes wear the pants that could be seen from across campus, but we never had any other meaningful interactions. Except for the time I passed her in the hall between classes and she waved and said, ""Hey, how's it going?"" I waved back and returned the pleasantry. 

Yesterday my wife and I were talking about people we have known with strange names. I obviously brought up pants girl, and my wife decided to google her.

There were only 3 results. 

The first lead to a video of her. In a wheelchair. Obviously extremely disabled and barely able to speak. I have no idea what happened to her. I don't want to know. But it broke my heart. All that color and confidence is gone. Maybe taken. But she laughed. It's the only time I ever saw her laugh. It was beautiful.",11Mar2020,1
71,"I'm matriculating at a university this year, but I feel so inferior compared to my peers. I'll most likely be attending an in-state school, not that it's bad or anything. However, everyone around me is travelling overseas, out of state, heading to prestigious colleges/universities while I'm stuck here. They're getting scholarships with different organisations, while I'm just hoping for something from the places I applied to.

I used to feel I'm as competent as them, but now, after looking at all the amazing things they are doing while I'm stuck at the same level for years, I don't know what to do. I'm assuming I get another start in university, but until then, or even in university, I don't know how I can possibly catch up.

It's a horrible, horrible feeling, and I don't know how I'm supposed to come to terms with it. Should I be angry at myself for not having the same drive/motivation/ability/work ethic as them? Should I acquiesce in my situation, try to be happy wherever I am, even if I will only see this gap get larger and larger?

77,"I’ve been with my current office for one year. It’s a tight-nit, smaller group and I very quickly bonded with everyone there (mainly coworker and manager mentioned herein). My direct manager left in October and still hasn’t been replaced, making our department of three, a department of two. As a result, my co-worker and I, and another manager had to pick up all of her slack. It’s been the most stressful 6 months of my life. But in those months this manager and co-worker have done everything possible to keep morale high, which has been awesome. The three of us are also the ones that go to trade shows, golf outings, and networking events together. I see both of them more than most people, and never get sick of being around them. 

I was scouted this week for a role that would be basically a dream job for me. I hear back tomorrow. However, if I got it I’m terrified I’ll be villainized by my co-worker and manager. I’d be leaving my coworker as the only person in our department, and just before our busiest two months of the year. 

I know for most people it would be an easy call. Jump ship, take dream job if offered. It’s corporate’s problem they didn’t fill the role, not mine. I’m really struggling with if I get the job, should I take it? I have never bonded to a team like this before. In all honesty, I do not love my role. Never did. What has kept me going in is the people I work with.

81,"Syrian war, Russia's war on Ukraine and the shooting down of an airliner, ISIS, climate change, Trump, Brexit, North Korea, Bolsonaro, China, Hong Kong unrest, Iran and now the coronavirus. I wish that advanced aliens are not just somehow a fantasy and I can manage to attract them to here and work with them in setting things right by any means necessary.

In team with the aliens my game plan is to force Russia onto the table and end the Ukraine war with a UN interim administration at ORDLO (Temporarily occupied and uncontrolled territories of Ukraine) and then a truly independent referendum held there for their people to decide their own fate not to mention paying full compensation in relation of the airliner shoot-down. If Russia at that point still doesn't want to submit to this then alien superweapons like big lasers and asteroid hurlers will do the rest of the job by making a scale of the bombing of Mars as seen in Star Trek Picard or Star Wars Scarif destruction out of the incorrigible nation. After all Putin is just the embodiment of Russia as a whole; in 5 years they appeared to changed a lot but in the scale of hundreds of years nothing has actually differed. I could extend it against North Korea if I wanted to.

I adamantly feel that only with such a terrible way of intimidation in setting thing right we can return to calmer times like the 90's or 2006-2007 or perhaps even more so. You either eliminate or contain cancer cells with things like chemotherapy or else let it grow out of control and kill the host. Russians are particularly a 'war-like' race innately and treats treaties as papers so only unfathomable hard ways like that can work.

In the happy ending where Russia did as I wanted to eventually I'd like to leave Earth altogether and go with them as a 'progeny' of humanity just in case coronavirus or climate change extinguish the torch of us as a whole.

82,"As I get older I realize you can’t win, people will either talk bad about your choice or good but ultimately you just need to rely on your own decision making skills and ignore them. I have a few examples where stuff like this has happened to me personally.

A few years back I got a Mustang GT, I was happy and proud about that car. Next thing you know I get unsolicited comments from friends like “sheesh I bet that thing is pricey, I’d not want to pay for that gas guzzler”.  I also received even random comments from strangers such as “you should’ve got the Camaro!”. This kind of talk is so uncalled for. I was excited and happy and got opinions that I didn’t even ask for. Of course there were also positive ones as well.

Another example: I started working out years ago.. I was excited to finally start gaining weight because I was a skinny kid. I got to the point where I got really bulky and was happy about it, then came the comments about how I was fat or bloated looking.. so I cut weight..got abs and then came the comments about how I looked too skinny. 

There are tons of these examples, I’ve seen so many people excited for something in their life or proud of who they are and instantly shot down by other people’s thoughts and opinions. These can lead to someone’s confidence dropping or even making them question the decision they have made. If I could offer any advice to anyone it’d be to be confident in your decision and not let others sway you from something you’re happy about or want to do.

I would get twitches before only on my eyelid so I kinda figured it was normal. However, even after I stopped dating her, the twitches continued, and only got worse. It literally happens all over my body (and im not exaggerating) but the most common places are my knees, arms, hands, thighs, and feet. 

I first thought it could have been that I did not receive proper closure with the girl I was in the relationship with, so I went to talk to her. She didn't want to speak to me, and even blocked me, but I still got a form of closure; that being that she was not comfortable as of right now to be friends with me or talk to me, which was understandable. The twitches have gotten a little better from then, however it still continues.

I went to the doctor to figure out what's from, and they told me to drink water or gaterade (idk if i spelled that right). It definitely did not work lol.

If anyone has the slightest clue of what has happened to me, I would really appreciate it if you could help. Because right now, it seems like these twitches are permanent.",11Mar2020,1

Then he started sending me to see him in 1992 for the summers. He is Laotian (asian) and can barely speak English, so there was always a language barrier. I mean I can barely speak it. 

But I dont have any memorable experiences with him. In the summers when I came, he would be at work and I would hang out with my cousins. 

He used to send me gifts or buy me things when I was younger, because I wanted it. As I grew order, those things were never truly made me happy. I wanted the dad experience, you know?

I have a step dad who raised me from the early 90's and I feel more attached to him if anything. We did things, he shared emotions and I was disciplined when needed, etc.

89,"I’m 21, never had sex, and I’m not gonna lie, I do get really down about it. Most of my close circle of friends all know and tease me about it a shit ton, which I’ve kind of just grown used to, but there’s been times I’ve seen someone kind of have a little interest in me, find out I’m a virgin through their teasing, and their interest drops off. People say ‘it’s no big deal’ to be polite, but they really think it is; I’ll see those same people casually throw it around it as an insult, joke about it, etc., like its something to be completely ashamed of and that you must be some raging incel if you haven’t managed to have sex by this point.

At this point cause I’m pretty sociable and take some care of myself, people just assume unless told otherwise that I’ve lost it. Outside of my immediate social circle I’ve got a couple of friends who I’m really close with who have no idea whatsoever, and will joke about how someone’s ‘such a virgin’ or whatever and I just have to kind of laugh along. I see shit like this online every fucking day man, it really destroys me confidence. It makes me feel like shit.

Like I know I’m not the most attractive person, I get reminded of it in little ways all the time, but I try to just get on with it and not be bitter; it’s nobody’s fault they’re not attracted to me. I do all the shit you’re supposed to do; hit the gym, focus on your social life, eat good, dress well, all that shit. I get compliments on my personality and dress sense all the time, people do enjoy being around me; but I have like no self confidence, which already makes dating hard, but seeing and hearing constant reminders that you’re some degenerate fuck up for not having had sex, that you should be ashamed of it and that there must be something seriously wrong with you to not be having it, makes it so much worse. I get that the creepy women hating incel types exist, but honestly when most people act like this about virginity and make it such a massive issue in people’s minds I can see how that toxic mindset could take over in some people and turn them bitter and cold.

Fast forward to today.

I was feverish, lethargic, tired from work and just doze off with my medications on the couch. Next thing I remembered subconsciously, my fiancé picked me up, removed my clothes, disposed my brief, drawn me a bath with my favourite candles and lastly he tucked me to bed. 

I realised something that day that this is one of many countless things",11Mar2020,1
91,"I’ll (24F) try and make this brief. For the last 10-12 years, I was close to a group of people and we developed a very strange yet bonded connection. I dated 3 of them (1 was only brief and didn’t go anywhere) and fell deeply in love with 2 of them. I was in love with the 3rd as we dated for 3 years, but the other 2? We were kismet. Over the years they had their relationships with eachother too. It was all interconnected and we had bonds with each member at some point. Whether it was friendship, relationship, friends with benefits, secretive, familial - it was always intense. The relationships with these people were intense, combative, toxic, passionate, blissful - I exposed every part of myself to them. We were either fighting or stuck at the hip, ready to combat anyone that hurt the other, even if it was eachother. It’s always been a strange dynamic, and we’ve all had different kinds of relationships with eachother over a period of a decade. Since middle school.
We’ve had so many fallouts with eachother. 
We’ve had so many blissful and amazing reunions. 
But over the past year or so, I realized just how toxic this was. I always knew it was toxic after so long of doing sh*t to eachother, but after all of the horrible things we did to eachother, after being exhausted from eachother, we slowly split. 
I was dating one of them on and off - that was a toxic relationship on both sides. The other two lived together but we still saw eachother occasionally due to two of them being sisters. 
Anyway - the dynamic became more strained and confusing. I didn’t know where I stood and we were all scared to share our feelings after so many fall outs. Or we avoided them. Or we just...kept going? Even though I think we subconsciously felt it was already past expired. 
Well last year, for the first time, me and the person I had dated on and off just stopped speaking. I suppose they thought I would eventually say something and I thought they would eventually say something - and we never did. 
A month of this and I finally messaged them. 
They didn’t respond, and that - wasn’t normal. Well since when was it normal for us not to talk for a whole month?
There wasn’t a fall out. There wasn’t a goodbye. When they didn’t respond - I didn’t message them again. I was afraid.

Maybe God was granting me grace with this slow burn, because another awful fallout and I might’ve just ended it. I’d wanted to end myself many times throughout the years. They were, and still are the most addicting and kismet group of people I’ve ever encountered. I feel as though they wormed into my soul forever. When I’m with them, I feel like I’m in prison, all the while waiting for their affection and seeking their approval. It’s terrible and wonderful all at once. 

I don’t frequently look at their SM because it’s obviously painful - I’m still only friends with one of them on FB, but we don’t interact, and I believe she hasn’t unfriended me because she possibly wants to spy on me (trust me - we were like that). The times I have looked, I see posts they’ve written that implies it’s possibly about me. How much they hate this person. How toxic they are. But I’m never sure it’s about me - I get sad and upset anyway, and try to go through everything I did in the last couple years to try and “figure it out”, or I get upset because I feel betrayed and hurt because of the things they did to me over the final couple years. I fight with myself on who’s to blame more, or even solely the blame. I can’t ever come up with a conclusion.

Over half of my songs I had on my phone reminded me of them and I had to get rid of it all. Certain video games, smells, even an entire genre of something reminds me of them and I can spiral and get stuck in a self abusive mental state. I blame a lot of my severe depression, my severe anxiety, my PTSD on the years of the strange relationships we had. It fucked me up in a way I cannot possibly explain. But I can’t say I didn’t do some of the effect to them too. I’m not completely innocent, I lied and gossiped and said hurtful things when angry or stressed. 
The complexity of our dynamic is nothing like anything I’ve ever experienced. I developed so many mental and physical problems. I’m the only rouge member now. They all live together. And knowing that they hate me, for a reason I cannot figure out, is torment. 
What rumor was spread this time? What lies did they hear from the other? What was taken out of context? Are those posts even about me? 

The times we’ve fallen out, whether it was one of their faults or mine or both, they’ve always come back. 
They always have. One of the members - the one I never dated officially but was the first and last one I was in love with - she told me “No matter what happens, just know I’ll always come back. No matter how mad - I’ll come back, okay?” 

And I’m stuck in this period of - just waiting? Waiting. Waiting forever and ever. Stuck in limbo between struggling to move forward on my own for the first time or just - waiting. Hoping. Almost wishing. 

I dream about them most of the time, sometimes I cry because I feel empty inside, like I don’t exist. I found other friends - but truthfully I can’t feel much. I love my new friends, but it’s hard to relate. Hard to feel a connection with them.
I don’t know what to do, and trust me I know this all sounds insane. I sound obsessed and insane. I’ve never gone in depth or even attempted to try and write out how I truely feel about this. Even then - this doesn’t even cover all of how I feel. 

I truly, with all of my heart, feel like an absolute outsider. Like I’ve been plucked from my true reality and placed into another world I do not belong in. I do not belong in this world. I don’t feel it. Sometimes I feel okay and happy - and other times I feel like I’m pretending to be this person I am not. I wonder of they really hate me, I wonder what they think about me, I wonder a lot about so much crap that’s it’s overwhelming. 

I DO want to move forward. But history tells me I can’t. Because when I’m at my last wit, they always come back and it’s like I’m replenished. But this time? I feel like it’s really done. But that small part of me that thinks they’ll come back still replays. It’s incredibly confusing. The entire relationship, they dynamic I had with each one of them was SO confusing. 

I’ve tried therapists over the years (not over the last two years) but they tell me stuff I already know. I just feel empty. I take medication for some of the mental issues I developed, but it’s not a complete magic fix. For the record I am happy and feel okay at least over half the time. But those days when I get into a dark headspace, or when I wake up from a nightmare about something to do with them, I’m an inward wreck. I hide it as best as I can, but I can’t breath anymore. I have to talk about how I feel or it’ll be stuck in me forever. 

Am I stuck this way forever or will I eventually move forward and live a normal life? 

TL;DR I can’t seem to emotionally move on from a group of people I had strange/toxic relationships with for over a decade, and it’s mentally destroying me",11Mar2020,1
93,"To J, An Old Friend of Mine

XXXX, who are you? No really, who are you? 
Think about it. We’ve known each other for so many years. Gee, I don't even want to think about how many years that’s been already. It seems sad to me that two people can know each other for so long and know so little about one another. I know so little about you. I know you have a mom and a dad, and I think you have a dog, I remember going to the same dinky little dumb elementary school with you. Soccer when we were little and all the rest. 

I’m in a place of unknowns and uncertainty right now. I don’t know how you’ll react to this, I don’t know if you’ll get why I’m even questioning any of this. To tell you the truth, I’m terrified. I’m terrified at the fact that I don’t know how you’ll react to me telling you these things. It might even just be a selfish endeavor, because to tell you the complete and honest truth, I’m not so sure I feel strongly about your reaction. All I know in this moment is that I’m expressing myself honestly and I’m not sure if you’ll choose to listen to me or hear it. Maybe it’s one of those things that mirror life, in that I have the gift to look on the past with complete scrutiny, yet the future is curious, terrifying, and mysterious.

I don’t really know you. sometimes we get those fleeting moments in life where we realize we’re a part of something so complex, something so intricate, and something so vast it makes me overwhelmed at what there is to experience, and a melancholic feeling swells over me and I get sad at the fact that it’ll always be cold inside my body knowing that it will all be for nothing. 

Why am I telling you this. I’m not really sure. I’m just expressing myself. I don’t know if I’m speaking from the heart, or talking from the soul, from the spirit, or something else. All I know is that right now I have to express myself. You’ve made a big impression on me. That might sound silly or ridiculous, but I want you to know it’s true. 

I think back to all those times I was a little kid in elementary school, and think about the circumstances that surrounded it. My parents were a little bit younger, I was healthy, I had no obligation to my future self to be who I am now. I fear for the time when I go back home and I realize my parents have gotten visibly older. It will just be an agonizing reminder that it comes for us all and I never want to confront this reality but I know I must. I know I should. 

I want to go back in time to when I was younger, even if for just a few hours. I wish I could fully appreciate what I had. It was wasted on younger me. I wish I could go back and be a better me. I wish I could go back just so I could hug everybody tighter and tell them I love them. I wish I could go back in time so the best things in my life are not just memories that I can never touch. 

Maybe I shouldn’t even be telling you this. Maybe I’m telling you this because I’m not good with people or emotions and constantly live in my own head. I just grew up that way, I guess, and all the accidents in the universe led me to this point in this moment. Maybe it was destined this way. I’ve never had a true friend. Maybe that’s why I’m telling you this. Maybe what I need or want is somebody to hold or somebody to talk to, or somebody to fuck, or somebody to express myself to. Truth is I don’t feel strongly about any of those things, they don’t interest me. I've wanted to learn more about you, but it feels like I just told you everything about me. Please, tell me more about yourself, if you’re still here and haven’t left. 

I just really want to hug you right now.",11Mar2020,1

96,"I only had two psychotic episodes in my life. One I clearly remember that terrified me because I didn't know what was going on. I dissociated really hard and became quite paranoid. I spoke slowly and nothing made sense in my mind. I remember being at the hospital and everything was extremely foggy.

My second psychotic episode was two weeks of amnesia. I just remember all of a sudden that I lost several friends and paved the way for a break up. Apparently I was aggressive, mean and paranoid. The thing that troubles me is no one will tell me what I did or said so I can take responsibility for it.

I was rediagnosed from Bipolar II to Bipolar Schizoaffective. My dose of anti-psychotic Latuda was increased to the maximum dose and I no longer had bipolar psychosis.

Two weeks of my life changed a significant part of my life and I can't remember anything. My last memory was leaving the hospital after calling 911 for suicidal ideation.

I know this was something out of my control but I still can't come to peace with it. My psychiatrist told me not to think about it but reflect on it but it easier said than done. How can I reconcile this part of my life?",11Mar2020,1

I've not encountered this first hand or recall hearing about this scene happening in real life. But, does this happen often enough that it's a commonly occurring scene? And if so, how do they know? What chemical reactions or neurological rarity occurs to allow such consciousness of ones own life force?

98,"honestly financially i have always been fine, family wise too. mentally i am fine as well, fortunately no anxieties and depression.

but since childhood there's always someone that wants to fuck me up. i got bullied a bit, (nothing physical) as a kid, not in school btw, but it definitely made me withdrawn. even caused a bit of a social anxiety. which i had to overcome. it definitely wasn't easy. 

there's always someone not liking me. i mean i do get that not everyone's gonna like you, but there's just way too much negativity when it comes down to me. at school, at other places, everywhere. there's someone that wants to bring me down. 

honestly, judging from all of that, im fine, well im doing really good actually. i never give up. overcame my fears and anxieties, tho there's still some things i got to work on.

but man. like people always tried to make fun of me. calling me ugly, used to be called quiet and slow cuz i used to be scared to talk at certain point of my life. (thankfully around certain people only)

i have lots of anger. lots of rage. i want to strike back. i can demolish all of them. i got no fears anymore. 

i still have certain insecurities. like right now, for example, well in general too, i think of myself as someone's who's good looking. honestly, im better looking than most girls too (girls used to make fun of my looks btw), but sometimes i still don't take myself seriously because of the way i used to be treated. thinking that everything i do is corny. even tho probably no one knows that, in fact, i think others would even describe me as narcissistic.

i dont know. i feel like im missing out on shit. cuz of that. i dont take pictures, dont use social media, cuz i don't know. the same thing. i think everything is gon look corny. but im sexy asf tho. and im a social genius, can control people. literally made older women like me. pretty popular among girls my age too. IM 18 btw. Revolutionary fashion sense. creative genius as well, i create  music and shit. i also have my philosophies as well. i can beat everyone up. like lowkey. i want to be famous. i want to have jesus like cult. im gonna strike back. i want girls to lick my asshole. i want to be great.

&amp;#x200B;

isnt this gnarly? you, my child, might be reading this and probably wont even have a fucking idea how lucky you are. no one around me knows how lucky they're. i seriously can become great one day. really big, and they will have the honor to say that they even knew who i was, to even have a chance that they were looking at me.

99,"Freshly dumped and I need to tell my story.

I moved to an island about 3 years ago. I met my ex, let’s call him “matt”, while I was out one night. He was so interested in me however I didn’t find him that attractive. He chased me a little and I finally gave in. We also started working together at a bar. I loved his personality and the way he made me feel but after a few weeks in the “talking” stage I noticed a chance. Long story short, he was talking to A LOT of other girls. Slept with more women than I can count and the whole time was obsessed (his words) with his ex. Turns out him and his ex has an insanely toxic relationship. He was always chasing her and she made him feel special for a day then dumped him. After him and were friends with benefits for a while, he admitted that he did love me it was just hard for him. We started seriously dating and I was the only woman in his life. He asked me to be his girlfriend and gave me a beautiful promise ring. It didn’t feel sudden because we were so intimate and close for over a year before this happened. During our relationship, there were a lot of red flags. The way his mom treated him and I was sickening. When he got black out drunk, he would become violent. In the first couple weeks of us seriously dating, I saw him text other girls. He apologized for most of it and told me that he was so insecure it was hard to break of those toxic habits but he would try harder. We moved in together and got a dog. 75% of the time he was the most loving guy on earth. So sensitive, so caring, such a hard worker. Would do anything to make me happy. But he would end things with me constantly. He wanted to hear me beg for him so make him feel wanted. Most of the time, they were bullshit breakups. Only twice they were real, and this was one of them. Last Sunday (his birthday) I came home to find him black our drink. He started an argument with me then broke my phone. I pleaded with him to just go to bed but he insisted on driving 25 mins to his parents. I took his keys knowing he couldn’t drive. This infuriated him. He ended up getting violent yet again and truly scared me. The next day he didn’t want to talk about it. When I told him he had to he said he wouldn’t apologize and “just roll over for me”. I couldn’t believe it. I started crying and told him I’m so sick of his pride getting in the way of our relationship, it’s ruining us. When he’s embarrassed or ashamed, his ego goes into overdrive to fulfill itself. He ended up saying thank you for telling him what he needed to hear and apologized. The next few days were hard for him. He felt so low and down on himself. I tried to bring him back up and assure him he’s a good person, because he truly is I believe. Well on Sunday we got into a small argument and he dumped me again. I told him I couldn’t deal with this toxic side of him. Mind you, I have NEVER broken up with him. Yesterday he came over and packed his stuff. He was ice cold. I haven’t heard from him since. It genuinely feels like someone is sitting on my chest. I’m so sad. There is no one else on earth I wanted to marry. I have such horrible anxiety and I just want it to go away. Sorry for the long post.",11Mar2020,1
101,"I didn't have nightmares in the classical sense since around 7 or 8 years. Last time I had one I think I was 14.  
Occasionally I will have the beginning of nightmares, but they never play out. Even when I have similar ones like I had years ago, they end normally. I am always able to take control of them and manage things my ""mind"" tries to prohibit me from doing. I know I can dream lucid, but I was only able to do it a couple of times just by wanting to do it in normal dreams, but I am able to do it all the time when I notice it's a nightmare.  
They are actually the most fun dreams for me. Sometimes when I notice it, I change from the ""protagonist"" to a ""watcher"" where I can see it unfold.   
In other ones I get myself purposely in dangerous situations like jumping off high places.   
The most fun was when I committed ""suicide"" in my dream to find out if the brain truly doesn't knows what happens after death. Yes, if you fall somewhere or into something you like flinch out of your dream, but if I suppress it, I just keep dreaming like nothing happened. 

But I also had dreams where it was harder to take control, but so far I managed every dream, the last one was I think 3 months ago, and so far my worst (I don't want to go into detail what happens in it, but it was really realistic and not so fun).

I want to know, is it normal that I for one rarely have nightmares, and second can change them whenever they happen? 

I was able to change some normal dreams too, in one I finally manged teleportation, which I never managed to pull of in a dream.

I just read that other people still have nightmares when they are older and I assumed you grow out of them. Is it not the case?  


For the people wondering how I stopped having nightmares. Easy, I had my worst one when I was 14. I made the mistake to look into a mirror in my dream. Then I remembered I learned about how some psychiatrists use lucid dreaming to help people to deal with their mental problems.   
I forced myself back into the dream after I woke up and replayed the dream and changed it.   
Since then I never have ever had a nightmare end badly. Some where actually very interesting and fun, others had a cool story to watch.   
In some I was able to face some of my underlying fears.",11Mar2020,1
105,"I am already 23 but I have never had a relationship. No MU, no dating, none of those things. 

You see, I am quite goal-oriented. When I was in high school and all of my classmates were having relationships, I told myself I am too young to deal with emotional hurdles like that. When I was in college, I told myself I have to study first because things like that are just distraction. I successfully graduated and now that I am on my first job, my officemates were so surprised when they knew I have never had a boyfriend, much less have been courted. 

Looking back, I know I wasn't very social. But tbh there weren't any guys who made moves. None that I can recall. I have a lot of female friends and am mostly casual around guys because I don't know how to befriend them. Now, going back to my situation at work, my officemates (who have been married and have children) were telling me that I should have a relationship. Even my older brother says so. They said timeline wise, I might get compromised. So I did a little math.

I am 23 now, basically I only have 6 more years to have my first child birth (because it is recommended for first time moms to give birth before 30) so it means I need to be married probably a year before that. If I were to find a meaningful relationship, I'd need at least two to four years to know my partner well (some might argue that time is not a determinant for a successful relationship, I agree, but let's be honest, you need to get to know the person WELL). Plus the fact that I am to get my licensure examination a year from now (hopefully) to be a licensed architect. I'd be 24 then, plus the four years I would be in a relationship. Latest age I would be if ever I would give birth is 28 or 29 which is dangerously close to 30. Also, its not like finding a guy to be in a relationship with happens in a snap of a finger. The deadlines are all too tight and Im wondering if im the only one thinking this way? 

Also, im starting to think that the problem must be in me. My doubts are starting to creep in. Am I too weird? Am I not agreeable enough? Am I not likable? Am I not fun to be with?

I know I shouldn't be second guessing fate, but not having control over this is somehow giving me anxiety.",11Mar2020,1
106,"These last couple of months have been really shitty for me (M20). At the start of the year I lost a good female friend due to a bad mistake from my end , this made me feel really sad when I realised what exactly I lost. Last month my dad moved away for business and has left my sibling and I at home with our mother . She's been really strong in trying to provide for us and make sure we have a good household as a family. Lastly , I've been getting this feeling that most of my friends are quite rude when it comes to treating people with respect and I felt really left out in their social interactions. One of them played with a guy's feelings over Instagram and when I confronted her about it , she brushed it off.  I felt as if some of my friends felt the same way with me too

I decided that enough is enough , it's time to just act and see what happens , I'm in control of my own life afterall

I saw my female friend today and spoke to her about what had happened and how I'm sincerely sorry for what I had done . She forgave me and said she values our friendship . For the first time since Jan we had a bit of a conversation and I eventually asked if she would help with editing for a film competition I'm in , eventhough I can edit it myself I knew that she needed something for her portfolio. She said yes and  felt excited about it too .

Before I went home yesterday I bought my mother some thank you roses and chocolates , it was an overall thank you for all she's done for us seeing that my dad is gone and she is woman alone

I don't hang out with those other friends as much anymore but this has allowed me to carry on previous neglected friendships and I found out that the people who care about you and are really with you , are the ones you least expect sometimes.

So if ever you feel find yourself in similar situations , just do good and act on something that you want to do. Trust me , It will lead to your own happiness in life . Stay awesome people and love those who are there for you !

In November 2019, I started feeling a little overworked because of the many responsibilities I had taken on and I wanted to take some unpaid vacation, because a lot of my colleagues had done the same and  I didn't have any more legal holidays. Suddenly, I was told that management had decided not to allow any unpaid vacation anymore. I started working on a slower tempo because I did a lot more than the average employee.   


One day the HR manager accused me of exploiting the company by not giving it my 100% all the time and she took away my right to work from home. Everyone in my company gets to work from home one day a week. I wasn't happy that they took that away from me, but the next day I decided to just learn to live with it and do my best. That day she decided to give me another remark. She accused me of leaving my laptop on my desk after work. It's true that I left it on my desk the day before and I wasn't allowed to do so, but everyone has been doing it for months now, and I'm the only person who got a remark. The next week, the company organised an event that would take place during the working hours. I signed up for that event and again she asked to see me in her office. She told me I wasn't supposed to sign up for an event that would take place during working hours because I had recently gotten the remark to work harder.   


A few months went by where I would just do my best and kept my head down. My coworkers and my manager were very happy with me, so I asked if I could start working from home again one day in the week. She said I wasn't allowed to and that I should take even more responsibilities on me. The CEO was at that meeting and asked me if I'm ""trying to get fired?"". I told him ""no, I'm just doing my best and I have given you no reason to fire me"".  


All the conflicts at work started weighing down on my and I felt like I needed a break. I asked the manager if an exception could be made and if I was allowed to take a week of unpaid vacation because I felt really bad physically. She said I wasn't allowed to. I basically asked her for nothing and it was still too much. Recently I was sick with a fever and I stayed home for a week. I had a doctor's note so it wasn't like I was just skipping work. When I got back to work after being sick they told me I'm going to be fired.  


But here's the outrageous part: everyone who got fired in the last 2 years, got a severance package based on the amount of time they have been working for the company. The last person who got fired, got 10 weeks of salary and got to go home immediately. I'm the first person who doesn't get such a severance package. Instead, I have to work for the company 12 more weeks and today it became clear that in those weeks they are going to give me all the most difficult and shittiest jobs.   


I am so angry at this HR manager on how she abused her power to put me in this situation. Everything she did, she is legally allowed to do and that's why I feel very powerless. For 12 more weeks, they are going to squeeze everything out of me they possibly can and I can't do anything about it.  


Thanks for doing this long read.",11Mar2020,1
129,"GF asked me to post this. It is written by her. We are both 23, if its relevant.

I'll try keep this short and sweet. I've put myself in a really tight spot and i think i have a rough idea how it will turn out but as a last resort i'll ask for advice here.

First of all; the essential info: i first started at my job only a mere 5 weeks ago, i have had my 10 week holiday planned since June last year, an abrupt redundancy saw me unemployed from the end of December until i found work in my current role and they did ask me in my interview if i had any holidays planned. Which (i know, i know) i straight up lied about and said; no. 

The management and coworkers of this (office) job are very progressive. They have a much more laid back attitude about work than i expected, which makes this more difficult for me.

My plan going into working for this company was to have a temporary low paying job to keep the funds coming in for my SO and i, so when the time came for the holiday i could give them my two weeks and cut ties. I wasn't entirely prepared for me to actually really enjoy the job, which, has since become a reality. I also have a very good relationship with my management team and co-workers. And they all regularly hint at me working with them for an extensive amount of time (the guilt is paralyzing).

The dilemma being: i'd love for the company to keep me on after 10 weeks but i know my chances are low. My BF thinks i should give 4 weeks notice as a courtesy but i worry that i will get fired. I know its a bit ridiculous but we need the extra weekly income right up until we leave. I thought 3 weeks would be the perfect amount of time but he thinks it would be even more damning in my case to give such short notice. 

I would love some advice on how i can possibly word this to my supervisor and also a good timeframe for breaking it to them. I know i'm an asshole, but i'd appreciate any witheld judgement for some help in the matter.

I will add: My contract does not have any mention of this issue so legal repercussions are not necessarily a worry.

Doing nothing, and waiting for opportunities, while having no one to talk to because everyone I used to talk to is busy, and switching through the three apps I use on my phone.

Recently, my lack of self confidence has really tarnished my ability to move forward. I've been creating lore for this universe of mine, and I've decided that I want to post something about it on the Worldbuilding subreddit. If you've ever been over there, you know that some incredibly talented people are posting things daily.

Thing is, they've been at this a LOT longer than I have, and I've just began 3 years ago. Adding the fact that they will continue to get better and better at time at drawing, writing, etc... I just feel like I'm falling behind when I don't post something. I want to genuinely enjoy what I do, but I cannot find a way to get away from judging my work against someone elses.

In ways, it does help to push me to work really hard. I've wrote page after page of lore, and seeing what others have had pushed me. At the same time, however, I don't draw well right now, I don't write anything really interesting, and I don't paint well...at all.

140,"TL;DR We were arguing, and she said that i'm not her father, to which i responded that she's right and that she isn't my daughter. (Obviously didn't mean it.) I have since apologized, but maybe i should do more


So, some days ago me (adoptive father of hers since the age of 3) and my 14 year old adopted daughter were arguing, and she decided to pull the 'you're not my father' on me during the argument. I was hurt by it of course, since i do consider her my daughter. I was pretty tired and busy with work stuff that evening, so i couldn't really think straight, and for some reason i decided that i'd fire back. I told her that ""You're right. I'm not your father and you're not my daughter."" She istantly started crying and ran to her room. After that, we didn't really talk at all for two days. During those two days i was still really busy with work, so i had kind of made her my second priority. Only after getting some of that work stuff off of my shoulders did i start to realize what i'd said. I decided to make an AITA post about the whole incident. (As if i didn't already know i'd fucked up.)  Pretty much everyone agreed that i was horrible, and i can't blame them, because i was horrible.

And a day after that i apologized to her. I told her that she is my daughter regardless of blood and that i will always love her as my daughter. I said i was so sorry for saying that and that i didn't mean it. She started crying and we hugged. Later she apologized to me for saying that i'm not her father. 

Now she's mostly fine. She's talking again, smiling and pretty normal all around again. But she still seems like she's a bit touchy or scared. I think that maybe my apology wasn't enough and that i should try to do something more. A lot of people in my original AITA post told me that we should get therapy. I didn't think it would be necessary at first, but the more i think about it the more logical it seems. I said something terrible, and she got badly hurt by it. Maybe she still has doubts in her head about my love for her. I would never forgive myself if she got trauma from this incident. I don't know what i should do after apologizing. Maybe i should just spend more time with her or something like that. Therapy is also an option.",11Mar2020,1

As much as she says she loves me more than she did him, wants to marry me etc, I can’t help but fear I am still insignificant in comparison to this guy.

If we get engaged ourselves I know she’ll get a load of “hope it works this time” jokes from others. I also wonder if she ever thinks “what if.” A lot of people can get over one cheating mistake and if she had done, she’d be long married with kids by now.

She makes me feel great and appears to have no hang ups about this (she even had a couple of other relationships inbetween), but even after 2 years together I can’t help but feel that no matter how much she loves me, in terms of significance that relationship will always be a more defining one in her life.

We have been friends since 13 years and that this broke is like one year ago. She probably didn't get that till this year. I moved 9 years ago, and we had contact over our phones on WhatsApp and even over Facebook. That was fine till 2018 and that was after the summer vacation. Milly barely answered since then, her profile picture was gone several times and every time I was afraid that she maybe blocked me. Like, these are signs for being blocked. Milly wrote back before all this and after this she did that barely. She never wrote any messages first, that was always me and it was fine that she didn't write first as long as she answered when I talked to her.

After a while I couldn't do that anymore. That was like last year after her birthday. We always send gifts and I send her what I thought would be fine. Guess what, Milly didn't say if she liked it or even got it. I asked her, she didn't answer. After two weeks I asked if we would be still friends and I thought she would at least answer to this... she didn't. I then wrote I give it up and even after her finally saying something, I just couldn't.

After a couple of months the pain, of having lost her became so big and even if it was me braking this up, I was so heart broken. I drank something, so I would have the courage to talk to her and also forget about this pain. We talked, we kinda made up but nothing changed. When we talked I asked again if we're still friends. She said YES but why did she say that if she didn't mean it? I mean that would have hurt too but I would have known that this was the end. Maybe I wouldn't have this much of a problem with this.

I blocked Milly again in October and also deleted her on WhatsApp and Facebook. I told you that we know each others birthdays? Mine is in January, and she realized that she can't send me any messages just then. It's probably just so painful, because it feels like she just doesn't care. Since a while I now see her anywhere and always dream of her.

So in the end I just want to say, thank you, Milly, cause the time with you was awesome. You were so crazy and unique but that's what I loved. I don't know why this is how it seems to end but I'm just glad that you have been with me. That I at least had something like the best friend. Even if I right now, don't know how to keep a friendship or if I even want to, I'm still thankful and wouldn't give any of my memories away.

I'm not going to get in trouble as my mom and stepdad are pretty chill, however I know I will get mocked for having it in the first place. My step-dad us persistent with what he thinks are jokes that actually hurt and when I tried to go to him or my mom about it he stops for a bit, forgets, then uses that sign if weakness to go back insulting the fact that I cant handle it. My entire body is shaking, not helped by my overall lack of sleep and only 2 cups of coffee as 'food'. 

Tl;Dr: my butt plug was found by Step-dad, instantly told mom, i made a stupid lie up as was scared, rather would have them find my fleshlight.",11Mar2020,1
