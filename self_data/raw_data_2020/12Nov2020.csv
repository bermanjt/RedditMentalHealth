0,Idk if they see me for me or that’s how I portray myself. It’s nice I get that cause in person people say I’m dumb because I get nervous of talking to people and it’s people who never really truly talked to me. A lot of people still judge a book by its cover and that’s sad .,12Nov2020,1

4,"This happens often. It makes me feels...idk, like am I doing something that allows this sense of comfort and trust so quickly? I don’t mind when people open up to me, I’m glad to talk to someone who needs it. But sometimes I get really tired talking to people about their problems all the time. Is that awful and selfish? Sorry. This turned into a rant.",12Nov2020,1
5,"I'm going back to school right now (in my 30's) and noticed that a lot of student's are speaking better during presentations, in terms of clarity and pacing, relative to when I was in college, but their sense of urgency (and I think lack of physical cues) leads to sometimes awkward endings when the teacher cuts them off.

7,"I feel like stress has been a majority of my life. I'm going to one of the hardest highschools in my country, because I thought I could take it and might get a better job because of that. Because of covid we go to school every second weekend. This leads to about 4 exams a week. I was always a pretty good A student, tho last year I was close to B. When ever I get a grade, even tho I know grades don't matter and my parents won't be angry at me, if it is a bad grade, I worry, too much. I'm waiting for 3 grades and I'm worrying right now. I get a D or C, I'm stressed and sad, tho I usually hide those emotions from my fellow classmates. I feel like it is really damaging me. I feel bad even when nobody is mad at me. I know school year is nowhere near close to an end but, will I manage to be above B? Recently I got an F in french, tho it isn't written because it's counting with the other grade, and I wanna tell my Mom about, but I'm just worried. Even tho it isn't written and even tho it's fixable and I know my mom is always by me, I'm scared. I wanna know how much worse am I from someone who is straight A.

8,"I highly doubt anyone’s actually gonna see this but for the first time in months I actually feel okay and somewhat ‘glad’ that I’m alive.

9,"Well, I know I am weird, in my own, unique way. We all are a bit ""weird."" It's just that sometimes I wonder what people think of me.

My friend has a discord server with people around my age that she knows, but they communicate in one word messages, have arcane slang, and constantly mention ""roleplay."" I on the other hand talk only in complete sentences in a formal tone and have problems with generating humor. I guess it doesn't come naturally to me. Whenever people are talking and I say something, the convo dies down. When I say something when people aren't talking, the server is silent as a grave and I talk into the void.

I really want to feel I belong but I don't. I wonder if they're just an insular clique with their own culture or if it's just me that's out of place. I'm only 21!",12Nov2020,1

11,"It's been 5 years now. I have tried to forgive him. Sometimes I even feel at peace with him after thinking about the root cause for why he did so much awful shit to me. But nevertheless I still remember the time he knocked me out after I confronted him for stealing something from me. When he called me slow and retarded in front of everyone and later boasted about making me cry. When he pinned me against the wall in the school corridor as my crush exited her classroom. I always remember this shit when I am trying to sleep and it keeps me up for HOURS in rage.

The worst part is that it only hurts me because of how unjustified, malevolent and reprehensible it is. I can barely wrap my head around why he did that shit, yes I know he got bullied in his old school and so he was projecting his insecurities onto me, but that explanation just doesn't suffice, which is why my mind hasn't processed and justified the memory and still regards it as a threat RIGHT NOW, and why I get fucking enraged and fantasize about making him squeal in agony. Other shit has happened to me but I get over it because I see why they did it, but not when it comes to this motherfucker.

How many years until I get over this shit? I hate insomnia. Plus I get resentful towards my parents because they didn't prepare me for this level of malevolence, which is not healthy. What do I have to do? Time heals all but am I missing something? Do I have to confront him and ask if he's sorry?",12Nov2020,1
12,"When I was in high school a few years ago I had to do at least 2 years of ROTC, the counselor said that it was mandatory for all boys. I wasn't sure if that was legal for them to do that though, it wasn't like a juvenile hall or whatever, it was a regular, public high school. Could they do that?",12Nov2020,1
14,"A year ago, I had this girlfriend who was in love with someone else pretty much the whole time we were together, and eventually left me for her. Fast forward to today, and I’m finding it incredibly difficult to trust my current girlfriend. The one I dated a year ago was my first, and I guess the experience molded me, and now I don’t know what a normal relationship is supposed to look like",12Nov2020,1
15,"I moved to USA when I was just 18 and that’s when i started my college. It was the last year of Obama’s presidency, but i honestly don’t have any memory about the political situation at that time because I was too focused on getting used to the new life and college. I knew same-sex marriage was approved by the Supreme Court that year, but i didn’t know what the bigger meaning behind it. I wasn’t political at all, because that’s the cultural of where I was from. Discussing politics can be dangerous and parents only want their children to have a good grade at school.

Then i spent a year study sociology at a liberal university, and i began to learn the basics things of U.S. politics. In November, Trump got elected. Everyone at my class was sad, really sad. Even though there were also a lot people think it was stupid and naive to be that sad. 

Under his presidency, which hasn’t been over yet, I always have something to worry, and my worrying peaks this year. I worry about being Asian walking on the street when covid started(my friend’s friend got beaten on the street in NYC randomly and being called racist slurs at that time); i worry about wearing a mask in the public(before it was mandatory at my city);I worry about my friends who were almost forced to risk their health to take in-person classes to stay in the U.S. to continue their education...There are numerous things that I have worried about in the past 4 years as a new immigrant, as a female, as someone having an Asian face. 

Now we know Trump has lost, but i found myself hard to relax. I honestly don’t know what the U.S. is like without being led by Trump, because I have never really experienced it! I really can’t believe i can stop most of my worrying now, seriously, can I? It’s been such a long time since i don’t need to worry what Trump would do next. I know I’m supposed to relax, and probably celebrate the victory a bit, but instead, i’m just confused and don’t know what should I expect next...",12Nov2020,1
17,"Today marks 6 years since I left my abuser. Six years since I said, “enough.” In those size years, I’ve graduated college, made amazing, life-long friends, met my husband, got married, moved half way across the country, and started a new career. Six years was also the amount of time that I was subjected to his abuse, almost to the day. 

Every day something triggers a memory of the abuse, but the flashbacks are becoming less real, less frightening. I don’t feel as panicky as often. I think it helps that I don’t live in the same area as him anymore. It also helps that I’ve been less afraid to live my life on my own terms, unapologetically, and that I’m paving my own way, with people who love me and support me in all that I choose to do. 

One more year— that’s all I have left to go until I’m a ✨brand new person✨. I say that because your body replaces nearly all of its cells every seven years. I will quite literally no longer be the same person I was when I was when I was with him, and you know what? That is exciting as hell. This next year is going to be challenging for a number of reasons unrelated to him, but it will allow me to focus on myself and allow me to help me become a better version of me so when I emerge a Brand New Molly, I can emerge unrecognizable, strong, and and emboldened.",12Nov2020,1
18,"I recently sent an email to an old friend trying to reconnect. **When I didn't receive a reply, I was shocked at how vulnerable** I was left feeling. It made me consider all of the emails, messages and letters that are just existing in the universe waiting to be answered.

I thought it would be fascinating and cathartic to start collecting some. I'd like to share them on an Instagram page (@ emailsinabottle) maybe a blog. While my email is pretty mundane, I'm hoping to come across some much more profound content.  **I think it would be healing for others to post, read and even reply to the words unanswered**. Thanks for reading.

Hi \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I hope this email finds you well!  I've been thinking about you for the last few years and trying to find you online. I finally messaged your sister on Facebook and she gave me your email address!  How are you!?!  What have you been up to!?!  How is 2020 treating you!?   It seems like it was both yesterday and forever ago that we were singing ""For Good"" at graduation.   I don't keep up with many people from high school or really have any friends left from that time, but I miss you and the music department. I have dreams all the time that we are back in chorus, or voice class with Mr. Johnson.  He is a recurring character in my dreams. lol.

I ended up at the school I never wanted to go to, studied abroad in Greece and finished elsewhere with a Master's in Film Studies. Do you remember Paul M? We started dating around then and fast forward ten years and we're married with a 2.5 year old named Sylvie and a 5 month old named Theodore.  I feel a little too young to be summarizing the last twelve years in a few sentences, but here we are!  I've been home with the kids and really love it, although we might be going a little stir-crazy since covid.

Anyway, I want to hear about you!  I really hope the last decade has treated you well.  I imagine you've had lots of great adventures, and I would really love to hear about them. :) I had been meaning to email you and then this photo popped up on my FB memories this morning.  Here's a current photo too.

Hope to talk to you soon!",12Nov2020,1
19,"It finally happened. For the past few weeks I've been dealing with some health problems, both physically and mentally, some bullshit with my son's mother, on top of my on going mid-thirties identity crisis.  
  
I woke up this morning to some mail regarding my son (it wasn't the best) his birthday is only a few weeks away, and it's not looking like his mother is going to let me see him. (We're still in a court battle)  
  
I had been fasting since last night due to some blood work I had to get done this afternoon ( long story short, I drank myself to death 2 years ago, coma, physical rehab, then actual rehab)  
  
I got home after the Dr. And had a sandwich, which after fasting, hurt like fucking hell to get down ( thanks to my fucked up organs)  
 
Like a lot of people this year, I've been dealing with loneliness in a hard way.  
  
I've felt detached ever since I woke up from the coma.  
  
Anyways, I don't know what happened, but I went to the patio for a cigarette and broke down. On my knees sobbing.  
  
I want to say I feel better, but that would be I lie, I feel worse than I did before.

22,"I’m 39 and I have never been in Love before. I find myself having feelings for my girlfriend. We dated each other for 3 months before making it official and so we have been together for 5 months. Which is really fucking awesome because we also became really good friends during this whole Tango that we danced.  Like I actually care about her, I think about and do small things to show that I care. 

I was married once before for 18 months but that happed for all the wrong reasons and I was trying to save myself by getting involved with her I’m sure I cared somewhat about her but I never felt about her the way I do about this woman.

In all honesty I don’t really know what love is or what love feels like. So I have really no clue what I am feeling but I know it feels good. 

All I know is every since the day this woman has come into my life I find myself wanting to better myself. Like she gives me this strength I don’t really know how else to explain it. She makes me feel cared for and SAFE and accepted.

I thank God, the Universe, or what every you wanna believe in for bringing her into my life!",12Nov2020,1
24,"I just found out about the tik tok trend where people pretend that they are holocaust victims and I want download tik tok just to meet these people then private message the people who created those videos and have a nice conversation with them, get to know them, start off nice and friendly.

We share laughs and stories, talk to each other, and have what seems to be a great relationship. We will travel the world together, and explore the world. I will act as if I believe that they are holocaust victims, and ask to go to the concentration camp that they were imprisoned at and, since they are all inbred morons, they will all say Auschwitz. I will gather them together to go on a tour where I will bring them all to the furnaces. I will lock them in and burn them alive in there because they are moronic, half-brained, dumbass, idiotic, uneducated, stupid pieces of shit. After I light the fire will then finally they will understand why I hate them some much.

25,"I don't know what I want. I fear ""getting out there"" to discover it. Even so, nothing I've heard about really lights me up in any significant way. I mean there are things that get my attention but only in a imaginary way. I like the idea of doing these things but when I go to do them all of my curiosity and motivation vanishes. I begin to ask myself what the point is. 

It can go really far down too. I might be very interested in a book or maybe a form of praxis but then my mind says something like, ""Oh, but won't entertaining these thoughts influence you in a way that could veer you off in a useless direction?"" but of course what use am I looking for in these ways of practicing or in these books about life?

I want to know what to do next. Here I am. I have my own place now. I am working at a deli. It isn't really a career but it's steady work. The next step would be to pursue a career or a calling and that's exactly the issue. I'm 22 and I'm at that point in life where I ""should"" be grinding and developing myself. But I don't know what I want in the slightest. Everything appears to be the same exact shade and color. None of it appealing. 

These past few years I've spent a good amount of time just lashing out, venting, arguing, debating, asking, and whatnot with people online. I discuss really basic philosophical and spiritual topics with others online. It has remained basic because I lack the motivation to read and so everything I've learned has been through a dialoguing with another. I probably have all sorts of incorrect ideas stored in my head by now. I could read but for what purpose? No book can tell me how to live. Even if it could, no book can live for me.

Video games do not interest me anymore. Only the idea of them. I will listen to soundtracks and I might turn my console on but I turn it off within 10 minutes because it feels very pointless and boring. 

I desire emotional, meaningful, and immersive experiences. I desire to share them with others. I fear intimacy, though. I fear being wrong. I fear wasting my time. I feel like I'm just waiting for the right moment to happen but I honestly wouldn't know it if I saw it because I don't know what I want other than what was mentioned in the first sentence in this paragraph. It's super vague and abstract. The things I desire are the things people usually come into contact with as they pursue something else. I desire the journey - it's what matters after all - but a journey doesn't seem to happen unless a destination is in mind. Where should I aim? Idk. Does it matter? Probably. 

People tell me I need therapy. I'd rather not. I've been trying out this whole ""self discovery"" thing. Ya know, I'll have a thought that contains an opinion or judgement and I'll try tracing it back as early as I can - oftentimes to childhood and how I was raised. I was told that this helps but honestly it's just another piece of information at this point. Great, now I know how my upbringing has effected me. What now? 

I smoke weed every day. My routine is this: wake up, go to work, get home, maybe I'll listen to music and browse reddit or watch anime, smoke weed, sleep. That's my entire life for the past year. Why don't you do this or that? Idk is it what I want? Idk what I want. Should I have people tell me what I want? How does that help me to develop? How can someone else know what I want? I can't even figure it out. 

Do I even want anything? Well, yes. I feel incomplete and unsatisfied with life. I know that much. I wish I could express myself clearer. I wish I could be more whole instead of existing so  fragmented. I wish I had a hobby or a skill to develop. I wish to connect better with others. I wish to overcome my social anxieties and fear of intimacy.

Woah woah woah, aren't those the wants you've been after? No. They are super vague and abstract desires that give me no direction. I desire a goal or direction. I want to want something badly enough that it retains my interest enough that I can finally seize it.

Like, if I had been given a million dollars right now I would probably just carry on with my routine. Because idk what I want. Idk what I want. Idk what I want. Idk what I want. Idk what I want

I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT. I HAVE NO PASSION. I HAVE NOTHING PUSHING ME OTHER THAN FEAR.

Ya know, I look at people around me. They are pursuing things. They have interests. Even if it is interest in what might be useless things. I've been half-assedly seeking healing for myself for so long that I do not know any desires besides wanting to feel human.

Imagine being so caught up in your own head, trying to figure out your next step, and instead of clarity you just get more confused. Of course the answer is to get outside of my head but outside my head into what????? Into something that I want? Idk what I fucking want.

I know I don't want this life I am currently living. I desire change. Oh nice, change? Another vague af desire that will get you nowhere. I have a library of unread books that I thought would help me. I have stacks of unplayed games that I thought would be fun. I have a couple instruments that I thought would keep my interest. I have all of these little things that I thought might catch my interest and keep it but when I interact with any of it I immediately become disinterested and bored. I begin to fill up with doubt. I've spent so much money on things that I never even touch. They taunt me from the places that I store them. I got tired of it and threw a stack of books from an author I am interested in into my closet so I didn't have to look at it anymore. 

Please, teach me how to want what I should want based on my psyche! What should resonate with this brain of mine? With my personality? Because I can't tell.

There is an idea that people like me have had to sever their psyche's in the past causing fragmentation. I mean, it happens to us all to some extent or another. You get rewarded for this action and punished for this other action so you learn to reject parts of yourself and to identify with other parts. The idea would be that there is a split off and undeveloped part of myself somewhere in my psyche that I left behind in order to adapt to my setting in my childhood. That's why self discovery is so important. If only I could discover and become aware of this/these part(s) of myself maybe then I could orient myself and things will call out to me like they do to others.

Hahahaha I can not even take pleasure in jaded thoughts anymore. I used to cope with cynicism. Now it just depresses me. I used to just troll all day long and get a real kick out of it but nowadays even that is boring. Nothing holds me. Ya know how hurt people lash out at the world? That's how I was. I'd gladly continue lashing, too, if I still enjoyed it. You may find that disgusting but it's the truth. At least it gave me pleasure. At least I enjoyed myself. Oh the power highs I got from the effect I imagined I had on people. I love being in the know. I love that power that allows for manipulation. It's so good. So addictive. To pull strings. I used to do it with real people back in school. OH fuck. I can not even bring myself to do that anymore. I don't want to risk destroying what is around me. It's not worth it. I don't want to fuck myself up more psychologically by fucking with others. You are what you eat and all of that.

It's so obvious! Just do things and you'll take them into you and become them! Oh, but what things? What things? Yeah, which things? Which things do you want? Oh here we go again!! I love this cycle so fucking much. If not for fear and guilt I'd just kill myself at this point. 

The only things tying me to this world are fear and guilt. Other people get to have cool things tying them here like passion and desire. 

Well, I'm gonna go smoke weed with my roomate and watch anime. I have the bong and he is waiting. Wow, what a vent! And nothing new was said or uncovered! And nobody will read this wall of text! Oh how I love shouting to the wind. It is my favorite pass time. 

I decided to post this here because of how vague the sub is. I thought to myself for a while of where I could vent only to realize that there is no place for me to fit in and so I'd need a catch-all sub like this to shout into. I thought about going to a discord server. I thought about talking to an online friend. But nobody can help. I can't even help myself. It's a deep and personal problem. People can only save themselves from issues like mine. Or maybe I am just telling myself that as a way to cope. If I lose all of my hope then maybe I'll suffer less even if I become less human for it. 

But I'm getting sidetracked. Time to go numb and distract myself!!!!",12Nov2020,1

28,"Sorry in advance if this is a garbled mess, im on mobile, dyslexic and sleepy. I just need to get this off my chest.

I'm a dog lover, with a huge soft spot for pitbulls. Just like them people are intimated by me, due to my hight amd resting bitch face. 

Like 4 years ago, when i was 16, I went to a family reunion at my Great aunt (GA) and Great uncle's (GU) house. It was there a met that 1 year old pittie Trixie. 

Trixie was a beautiful dog with a  Cappuccino tan coat and  vivid green eyes. Not only was she gorgeous but so friendly and full of love. We quickly formed a bond. I played with her  for a while and when i heard my GA complaining about the hassle of walking her soon I quickly volunteered. By hour 2 she was stuck to me like glue, following every where. I'd like to note that during this point my GU has been in the kitchen while we were in the garage/ yard.

Unfortunately the more I interacted with Trixie and listened to GA talk about her the more I became concerned. 

-They got her at a puppy mill.
-They got her for the purpose of being a gaurd dog (something im not sure Trixie has the temperament for)
-Trixie was starved for attention
-To ""train"" Trixie they would sometimes hit her (""no too hard!""GA assured me. umm okay)
-GU has been getting frustrated with Trixie alot recently 

It was after i decided to give her all the love her wanted while i was there to make up for her unfortunate circumstances, Did my GU walk in. as soon as she saw him she tried to hid under my chair. As soon as he saw her his faces twisted into something i had never seen on him. before I could really react he had crossed the space between the door and me and Trixie picked her up and dragged/threw her into her cage a few steps away from us. 

I was in shock. A quiet ""why did you do that?"" was all i was able to say as Trixie whimpered im the back of her cage.

""I don't want it out"" he told me bluntly. His face turn back into one i recognized. GU started telling me how much of a waste of money she was, how she too friendly and stupid to understand gaurd. Trixie was stared at me from her cage. ""help me"" was what i saw in her vivd green eyes, the same that were filled with happiness a few moments before. 

I'm ashamed to say i did nonthing did no speak up about how beating a dog does not make it ""tough"" or how a dog needs love amd affection. I was always bad with confrontation and i was dealing with undiagnosed general anxiety disorder.

All i could do is listen to him rant about her, and go sit with family inside when he requested me to. z
An hour later my parents decided it was time to go and i just left with them. no goodbye for Trixie. I felt awful, i still do. Why didn't I call at least animal control? why didn't i stick up for her? Why did i gove her a glimmer of hope just to yank it away?

they live 6 hours away, and we dont really talk ro them anymore because of unrelated family drama. I haven't seen or heard about trixie since but i think about her alot.",12Nov2020,1
29," 

It always happens, every single time. Latest example -- I just sent an email reaching out to someone to work with my company and it had a couple of mistakes and the guy immediately sent back a really snarky and rude reply calling me out for it. This is like the most smallest, insignificant shit that should barely even be a blip for anyone but for some reason it stings me at the very core and I'll probably mull over this and feel like shit for weeks if not months until the next embarrassing incident comes around. And it'll torment my memories for years if not decades after. What the hell is wrong with me?",12Nov2020,1
30,"So, as usual, I was venting to my friends about how my mom called the cops on my dad and he broke down my bedroom door. This time, I was venting to a different friend group. However, this one friend who I have known for quite some time said things like ""It isn't that bad,"" ""Don't exaggerate,"" and they also said ""Don't tell us,"" even though I just wanted to get it off my chest. None of my closer friends did anything about this, they just stood there and I was about to give him a piece of my mind when I pulled the good ol' ""My mom texted me got to go"" and left. I just feel like shelling up and not venting to anyone anymore. I was just so broken when he told me to just not tell them, he implied ""We don't want to hear about your problems dude,"" by saying that.",12Nov2020,1
31,"Growing up people used to tease me about the house I lived in and for my shoes. My young and uneducated mom got mixed up in drugs and fell in love with my brother’s dad. I am the oldest and my brother is six years younger. His dad became my dad, considering that mine left my mom after she got pregnant for me. My brother’s dad taught me how to swim and how to ride a bike. He also made me watch him punch my mom in the face and also hold a knife to her during one of many of his meth binges. My mom finally decided to take my brother and I and she left him. She had $699 in welfare and she found a $500 apartment. We were dirt poor. Our house was an old shack. There were holes in the floors that allowed rats to live with us. Ironically it was built next to a very luxurious condo. I told people I lived there instead. I would pretend that I was keying in a key code and after they left I’d hop a wall to my real house. People would tease my brother and I for being so poor but looking back now I’ve learned valuable lessons. My mom didn’t have money but she had options to leave her abusive drug life and to take care of my brother and I. She did exactly that and she never looked back. She left the drugs and my brother’s dad. I look back now and see how ungrateful I was for not realizing that my mom did her best. Today we are all fine. My mom got a great job as a secretary and I went to college and I work hard. My brother is a manager for a top retail clothing store. Looking at all I have now I remember not to be ungrateful and to remember that your parents probably try their best to give you the best. Nobody is perfect.

36,"It's been a while since I've been on Reddit, just scrolling away mindlessly. Because of that, I've been on Discord more often- no significance at all.

I've turned to talking to my irl and online friends there. But every time I try to get one thing off of my chest, it always turns into a conversation about someone else. I wanted to vent about my personal issues but that's nearly impossible. Goes something along the lines of, ""I'm in physical pain."" ""Me too- I couldn't get out of bed this morning, it hurt so much."" Then another person joins, ""Oh no, are you okay? That sounds really bad."" And they continue on with a conversation... I get completely disregarded.

I'm sick of it. No, I don't try to change it back to me. In fact, if they are in need of good vibes, I send them good vibes to make them happy. I fear, if I tell them, they'll get all testy with me or reluctantly do what I ask.

It just feels like every fucking conversation I have ends with me getting thrown off to the side and ignored. I just need to talk about *something* that bothers me, but I can't, not without someone coming along and taking that moment.

How would I even go about that? ""I'm getting annoyed with how often you guys change the conversation into yourselves""??

You guys don't even have to answer that.

He is more emo wants to own a gym and I am more country and I am in school for nursing.  The more I think about it, I feel as though my plans for the future will be stifled if we stay together because none of our future plans fit together and we’ve just never really talked about it.  He wants kids, I do not; he wants to live somewhere warm, I do not; he wants to own a gym / be a personal trainer, and I do not see the monetary gain for that until you are super well respected in that community; there are many, those are just the ones I can think of right now.  The problem is, although I have no intention of breaking up with him for unnecessary reasons, I am slightly trapped in this relationship because he has told me (in a roundabout way) that if he doesn’t have me, he will commit suicide. He hasn’t used it as a threat, it’s just a passing comment and I never know how to take it. He is so fun and we have many good times together, but I just feel like there will be future arguments if we continue on like this.  I just need some outside perspective as to if I should talk to him, stick it out and see if it’s worth it, or just cut it off now because it is still so early in the relationship.

I literally had to borrow important paperwork from my coworker so I could make copies and fill it out, I was not made aware of what I needed to do to get my parking pass renewed, I was explicitly told that our new contract meant we weren't working on such and such which turned out not to be true and made me look like an asshole, I wasn't informed of my new schedule until the very fucking day I was supposed to work (did I mention I was switched to night shift from day?), and now I have been given my crew's empty timesheet on the final day of our work week.

40,"I’ve been at the same job for almost ten years now. The first seven or so years I was pretty happy there honestly. But after the new manager took over a couple years ago I’ve hated it there. She isn’t the nicest person to work for, and the quality of the work environment went down tremendously. I just dread going in and it’s effected my mental health outside of work, knowing I’d have to go in for my next shift.

The last couple months I’ve been working hard on myself and my mental health. I’ve been constantly going to the gym 4-6 days a week, eating healthy, quit drinking. I’m down almost twenty pounds. 

I’ve wanted to go back to school and finish working on becoming an RN for a while now. But I had a baby almost two years ago and have been a completely solo parent the entire time, so my time was limited. But now that he’s getting older I’m ready to go back to give him and I the life we deserve. So I registered for classes and go back in the spring. 

With all these positive changes I knew I couldn’t stay at my job anymore. So I applied somewhere else, went in for my interview, and got hired on the spot.  My last day at my current job is this Sunday. I can’t tell you how excited I am. I feel so relieved and like a huge weight has been lifted off of me. I’m literally over the moon to leave where I’m at.

43,"Not really sure this is the subreddit for this but I've been feeling for a while now that some form of expression can really help me and could also help just about anybody. Some people express themselves through art or other mediums but since I haven't really found a talent for any form of art I figured through written thought may be the best way to go about that. Since I have been debating doing this in some form for a while now I have thought about why I have this need, what I want it to accomplish, and also whether or not I should just write and keep it hidden. I guess I just wanted a place to express things I think about whether it be philosophy, the struggles that seemingly everyone goes through but not everyone talks about, or struggles that maybe people talk about but that I just want to dive a bit further into. Really I don't know where I want this to lead but I have a feeling that maybe I just feel that getting things out and knowing that someone might read it makes me feel as if I'm being heard in some small way, and that maybe I'll end up striking chords that people would like to work through together. Expression can help one work through their thoughts, it can help people start conversations they didn't know they wanted to have, and I think really why I'm doing this is so that I can feel as if I'm not alone in swimming through my thoughts. If this maybe isn't the subreddit to be posting thoughts or potential insights into my life or life in general, feel free to let me know and on top of that, if you have any thoughts about ways that expression can help someone or in some cases be necessary, feel free to start a conversation.",12Nov2020,1

Anyway, one started posting all this pro-Trump stump.  Just tonight she shared a video from a some ""Pastor Greg Locke"" in TN, titled ""I HAVE 100% CONFIDENCE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WON. GET READY FOR SOME SERIOUS TRUTH.""


She hasn't been in the US in about 4-5 years, so she's even pre-Trump.  This is like the 5th pro-trump post I've seen from her in 2 days, so I finally responded.....


&gt; Do you have any clue how absolutely fucking stupid you look spreading BS lies about the US election, when YOU LIVE IN XXXXXXXX! This doesn't affect you one bit.  You literally don't know shit about Trump/Biden and are playing it off like you're some expert. If you want to tell me about the fraud, go ahead and try, and I can shoot you down on every bullshit attempt you will make. Trump's own lawyer have lost 10 cases already. Trump lost because he acted like a piece of shit for 3.5 years.


Wait 5 minutes, and I was unfriended.  Whatever....but I wasn't going to drop it so I sent her a PM.


&gt; ...unfriend me, sure, because you can't argue a damn thing I said.  How pathetic.  Keep quoting bible verses and then I LOVE TRUMP BS, a man who married a nude model, has sexually assaulted women and paid off a porn star.  You are literally the definition of hypocrite.  


She responds....


&gt; Wow If it makes you Happy to Think im a Hypocrite, then 🤷 i can't help you. I don't plan on arguing anything. The Bible is the Truth.


I called her out on some ""non bible friendly"" activities or views of Trump and she kept responding with happy BS like this...


&gt; I have nothing personal against you, or anyone 🙏 but I will continue to stand for Spiritual Truth my friend


A couple more rounds and she finally answered my question with her reply of...


&gt; I cannot stand to see babies butchered



And there you have it.  Literally everything Trump does is OK because he's anti abortion.  Again, this is a female minority, not living in North America, and proudly rooting on Trump.  I even gave her statistics that banning abortion just causes a increase in death in women having illegal abortions but that doesn't matter, nor does any good that planned parenthood does either.

45,"It's kind of frustrating. I find it impossible to trust anyone these days. It's so hard for me to open up to women because they seem to hurt me every time. 

It all started with my mum. She was just straight up neglectful, and not cut out for the job. That's set my entire life up to be what feels like endless misery. It was backed up by my sister, who was just straight up abusive. I could essentially never relax growing up, because I'd never know when she'd get nasty and take it out on me. 

Since then, every woman in my life has been similar. I've been cheated on, abused, manipulated, or just let down when I've needed people. The worst experience was when I was at my lowest point in life and some girl used that to exploit me. Pretending to be my girlfriend when she was in a long term relationship and in similar affairs with other men. 

Female friends I've had over the years have always leaned on me for emotional support and I've always been the kind to give that without creepy expectations. But none of them are there when I need someone to talk to. 

This hasn't turned me into a misogynist, thankfully, but it's made me essentially terrified of women. It's frustrating because I still have desires for intimacy but I have a straight mental block when it comes to actually expressing it. I'm always mistrusting women in a really weird and toxic way. I don't know how to stop it. 

Anyway thanks for coming to my TED Talk.",12Nov2020,1
46,"I hate having such a toxic mindset, but its built up over a long period of time and i cant deny that. Im beginning to push away my ""close friends"" and im keeping my best friend and long-time crush in the dark because i dont want to worry her. I dont feel like i belong with them anymore, but ever since i introduced my crush to them ive quickly seen how much more attention she receives than i do. I guess thats what happens when i like someone whose personality and sociability is more in tune with my friends' than mine is. Im so fucking jealous and im being really petty, but i hate it, so much. Theyll go out of their way to be friendly and make her feel like an esteemed guest, but they wont try and converse with me. Not that i can blame them; im not very outgoing in the first place, so they have not much of a reason to try and tell me stuff too. I really hate myself for this, but im really possessive with her, so them making all the conversation with her and leaving me in the dust leaves too bad a taste in my mouth.

But god, what i hate most of all, is how much i dont wanna be like this. Our past is so weird and jarring, yet our relationship *feels* solid. But i still cant find it in me to trust her completely; ive felt used, and maybe even now i do too, but i also feel like im trying to use everyone, all because of my jealousy and my baggage. I know the way shes treated me in the past, and we made amends months ago, but its started to wither away once again, and im angry about my situation. Im selfish;  i know im trying to prioritize my own image instead of others', because i dont want to look like an asshole if i break away from them and they turn out to have genuinely liked me. Still it would be better to leave a toxic person out of your life than to keep them in. It keeps festering inside me, and my selfish distrust of everyone, especially my crush, is eating me alive.

Im so fucking sad, im a toxic coward. I dont have the gall to even tell my crush how i feel about her, let alone about all of this bullshit ive surrounded myself in. Im letting my past trauma get to me, but at this point why wouldnt i if ive been ignored like this? I guess we all share the blame, but i hate how hateful and dishonest its made me.",12Nov2020,1
47,"For context, I wanna start off by saying that my sister and I have different views on the whole ""blood is thicker than water"" thing. I don't care that someone is related to me, rather I care about how they treat me. I don't speak to my mother (because drugs) and I don't speak with my father after he cheated on his wife this year, but mostly because of how he handled the situation. I don't talk to my mother's family, because they've never cared much for me, and I don't dislike my dad's family, but I don't feel close familial ties with them anymore. My sister thinks about reconnecting with our mother, still occasionally speaks with my father, and has a good ongoing relationship with my dad's family.  

   

At the beginning of this year, she left my dad's very abruptly because of the affair situation, and was happy to come live with me and my husband. It was a budget stretch as she couldn't work yet, but it was doable, and she finished high school here. All has been well, except for covid-19 throwing a wrench into our plans. We've had to wait and wait to get all her documents and only this month will she be able to get her ID. I arranged so that she could go visit family for a month or so, and get her ID there, and then come back. Things she said had me on edge though, and I sensed that maybe she'd be moving there.  

   

  

She has a lot of dental work to get done, and as I said, this has been a financially trying year. Family offered to pay for her dental work ($3000+) on condition of her moving in with them, and very likely can provide her other things I can't, like school, a car, etc. She told me a few days ago that she was ""thinking""  about moving there, but I gather from the tone of the conversation that it's a done deal. I clammed up, said it was good she could get that stuff taken care of, and just asked that she give me a timeline so that I can prepare for moving her stuff and all.  

   

  

Since then, it just hurts so much. I'm generally very emotionally reserved but always troubled, and I don't have family to speak of, really (just my sister, and my brother who also lives far away). I have maybe 3-4 friends I never see, and my husband, and otherwise I have thrown myself into work for the better part of the past 4-5 years. I feel so fucking lonely, and I've been leaning on her emotionally for a lot of this year. She greets me when I come home and always watches things and plays games with me, and is always laughing away in her room and bringing life into my place that isn't there otherwise. She's texted me once or twice here or there, but I can't bring myself to talk to her. I don't want to punish her - I just don't know how to say anything good right now.   
  

   

I was lying in bed at night last night thinking about my parents and the lack of a family unit feels bad, honestly. I obviously love my husband, but I can't help but feel a deep lack of security in life - what if something happened to my husband, or happened between us? Who would I turn to then? The aforementioned 3-4 friends I have, I can't really bring myself to really talk to in that way. All I can muster is having fun in-person when that rarely happens, and maybe every now and then making some generalized statement about how depressed I feel, but moving past it almost as soon as it leaves my mouth. Moreover, I can't stop feeling like a failure, or like I've done all the wrong things in life to en up here. I don't know what's wrong with me, nor how to fix it.  I'm so sad, and I'm so angry.

I just wish we could have civilized discussions here and find *some* common ground instead of constantly having our attention drawn to how “evil” the other side is. Has it always been this bad? Or was there ever a point where people could see others as people and make compromises?

49,"A tiny introduction of me before the story. Age 21, male, from Malaysia, with disturbing thoughts, wanting to be a better person.

**SOCIAL REJECTION: Too long of a story, but TL;DR**

In primary school since August 11 2008, get bullied by at least potentially 300+ students (90+% of students of the age group), including former friends. Graduated without friends.

In private secondary school, got betrayed in just a few days and turned everyone in the same age group against me, leaving me with no friends again. This time came with blackmailing threats.

Got depression once I lost my naiveness at 16, because I figured people really are just that horrible. Became paranoid and misanthrope. Threaten suicide in front of the students, only to receive the response ""Nobody cares"". Multiple suicide attempts, only held back by my phobia of death. My parents noticed my depressive behavior, but blamed it on video games, when it was my only source of comfort. My mother was even willing to dump the PC itself should I misbehave. Told my bullying problems (disregarded the potential blackmailing), only to get the response that I was simply exaggerating a minor problem.

Behavior changed a lot. Full of extreme pessimism and hatred against society, even being called a demon by my mother.

**PLAN MY LIFE: Another too long of a story, but TL;DR**

I don't want my life to be like this. I planned a lot of details on how to progress life and then playing with it not too different from playing strategy games. 

Planning begun from age 17. What I wanted - people to hear my story, like and respect me, to solve problems. First step was to see a psychologist to determine potential mental disorders I had developed. Only seen him at October-December 2019. Results turned out that I had Asperger's and my behavior was just its manifestation. 

Step two was to change my identity, because I fear my old contacts will attempt to defame me. Did that with the push from my psychologist at mid-October 2019. Comes with a slight appearance change, behavioral change, and contact change. Legal name remained unchanged because the legal processes were just too much to handle. This changed a lot for better, but sadly isn't really noticeable to my family.

Currently in step three, which is do my career stuff to reach my target life. I don't want to disclose my career path for personal reasons.

I even plan on who should I interact with. This, since probably last month came with an unexpected result. My desire to be alone had been overridden, and I started feeling lonely. I couldn't interact with my family as it still turns into arguments. My sister is the exception, but she has family bias and is currently busy. I just wanted someone non-family to chat with, hoping to get a good time out of it and developing my social skills.

I guess I have to just sit here and wonder if someone is going to PM me for a personal chat... If not, so be it...",12Nov2020,1

54,"I've always been kind of obsessed with generations, historical events, years of birth, imagining where people were in this or that year, the pass of time... You could say I'm kind of a philosofical observer of time, and I mean that with absolutely no vanity or anything. It's just the best way I've found to describe it. Of course, I wouldn't consider myself an expert in any philosofical terms (I can, though, tell you the year any famous or semi-famous person was born in seconds with high precision).

Anyway, this is about my grandma. She's 88 at this point and godfucking damn I know we are somehow losing her. I live in a different city. She's somehow independent, all her four children care for her and her needs and she is very much loved.

On the flip side, her hearing is really, really bad, she has smoked her whole life and now her lungs are suffering from it (astonishingly, not as much as they should for a lifetime of smoking) and she sometimes gets confused in conversations, but I like to thing that it's due to her hearing. However, recently she called me and I gladly called her back. Phonecalls are difficult with her if she isn't prepared with her hearing aids, but this time was like... Bad. She told me she meant to call my father, and I happily told her I would tell him myself to call her, but then when my father did, it turnt out it was her son, my uncle, she wanted to call.

It felt different... Like a low point. And now I feel like I'm running out of time with her. I've actually felt that way for a number of years. She looks old and fragile and everytime I see her I think it could be the last time, and I take pictures of her thinking it will be the last. Nothing ever happens and I end up with more nice pictures of her, but man, now I feel like it's closing time. Like any day now I could get the call and get on a train. Should I bring my daughter? I don't even know where to start.

And the thing is I feel like I've been immensely lucky in terms of people dying around me. The closest deaths have been my wife's grandma and grandpa, which I didn't feel especially close to, but otherwise... Nothing. Nobody has died in years. No friends, no family, no family friends... And I feel like it's getting closer. Like the time is running out for many people, for a whole generation, my grandma's, who are just old. For my parents' generation, who aren't that old, but statistically illness should get some one day.

And I just feel like that wave is gonna crush me. Of course, I will get over it eventually, but the contrast of not having funerals or deaths of people close for years, hell, decades, it's getting me anxious. Like everything is happy in my life and death will cut through some day and just never stop.

62,"(23M) Hello, I'm making my first Reddit post of this year in the hopes that it might resonate with anyone struggling with something similar as I am. As the title suggests, this year I've been juggling the stress of the pandemic and political turmoil in the US with the stress of mental illness. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder four years ago. I've also been diagnosed with psychotic depression and social anxiety. I've been on medication for those four years and speaking to a doctor and more recently a therapist.

Covid-19 has been part of my reality for slightly longer than most Americans, because I travelled to Shanghai in late January with my family and saw the incipient effects there. From Shanghai I flew to Tokyo for a solo trip during early February. Quite possibly the most fun I've had in my life. But it was overshadowed by the growing news about the pandemic, which at the time I believe had just begun being reported outside China and declared a public health emergency. So it was also anxiety-inducing being alone overseas then. To add to the emotional turbulence, I ended up losing my virginity in Japan to someone I met there and felt a genuine connection with. That experience stuck with me, and I really cherish the memory, but it's also very bittersweet.

Since returning from Asia, shortly followed by the spread of Covid-19, I've experienced multiple more life altering experiences. I lost my job, and for a few reasons had to move out of my family's house and begin living alone.

Emotionally, two things have kept me going: music and social support. I'm fortunate enough to be able to engage in what I'm passionate about without leaving my apartment, that would be music. Making music is a reason for me to get out of bed in the morning, and it's how I channel my feelings into something positive. I believe having a hobby can go a long way in preventing you from falling into a depression.

The other source of morale for me would be my family, friends, as well as my doctor and therapist, all of whom have been a constant for me throughout this year. I'm also grateful for writers like Kay Redfield Jamison (An Unquiet Mind) and Elyn Saks (The Center Cannot Hold).

I've been through a lot of stressful situations in my life, including divorced parents, family illness and hospitalizations. But I think it's safe to say 2020 has been the most tumultuous year of my life. Which I'm sure is the case for many people. But over the years I've learned a lot about how my mind works, and gotten better at coping in healthy ways. Since March I've significantly reduced my alcohol and weed consumption and at one point was totally sober for a four week stretch. I've also sought out therapy which has been very helpful.

That's my 2020 in a nutshell. It's early morning here and all my friends are asleep, so I'm sharing it with strangers on the internet. How are you all doing?",12Nov2020,1
63,"From the start of this year, Ive been having self esteem issues, particularly with how I look. I cant help but feel like Im ugly.

Im probably going to be called an asshole for this post but whatever, most of the people around me has described me as good looking. No one knows that I have self esteem issues.
But I cannot accept the same judgement for myself. Recently Ive been thinking of buying contact lenses and Ive been looking at myself in the mirror to see what I look like without spectacles and I feel like I look even worse.

Has anyone ever gone through this? Any tips?",12Nov2020,1
64,"Back in March, my ex had broken up with me after she cheated on me while I was traveling for work. Before that, I felt like I had settled and would do whatever I could do to make the relationship work. I sacrificed myself, my friends, my family for this and it was the worst thing I could have done. After the relationship ended I couldn’t focus. I felt like I needed someone in my life to keep me happy. 

In these last 9 months, I have pushed myself out of my comfort zone chasing goals, making plans, and have tried to make myself a better me. I’ve gotten in the best physical shape I have ever been in, the youngest to be promoted ever in my current employer (23), and right now I am working on buying a house. 

I don’t need anyone to make me happy, sure I would like someone to share my life experiences with on a romantic level but I know that will come with time. I have a great job, great attitude, confident, am relatively attractive (in my opinion), take care of myself, and have goals I am working towards that aren’t dependent on anyone else. 

I have never felt more successful, more proud of who I have become and and am excited to keep making progress in the future. The last 9 months have been a rollercoaster for with almost getting stuck in a foreign country while away for work due to Covid in late february, being cheated on, finding and moving to a new apartment on my own, losing my grandmother, changing my mental and physical health, and so much more. There will be more ups, there will be more downs but all I say is bring it on because I am ready for the fight.

Anyone that has felt this way or feels this way, keep pushing, challenge yourself, be the best damn version you can be because YOU deserve it.",12Nov2020,1

73,"My wife is waiting for a test. She says that they said it's going to be two hours until they can do the test and I have no idea how much longer after that to get results.

She moved to the U.S. from Venezuela five years ago and we got together four years ago and since then, she has been through so so so much. She had to flee the country because she was in the wrong political party at the wrong time, which her dad was a leader in, and when he died, she went into hiding before escaping.

She's an expert in business management and international sales. Before her country went to hell, she was traveling to Switzerland and Africa to negotiate sales of oil equipment. She speaks four languages and has worked in eight countries. Since she got here, she's been doing menial, insultingly bad jobs working for abusive fraudulent assholes. She texted her current boss from the hospital and he let her know that she needs to come into work tomorrow.

I have a pretty good job and I make enough to mostly support us, even though I can't pay off my student loans, pay off my credit card, or save money. We have a nice apartment, and we can afford food, health insurance, and mostly pay to keep my car running.

But its so hard for her. She was so stressed out from what happened to her in Venezuela that she broke four teeth in her sleep. She puts so much stress on herself to do right by everyone and she feels terrible that she's not able to contribute to help our household and take some of the pressure off me to work nights and weekends to make sure I have a job.

We had an opportunity Before COVID to open up a psychology office with a friend of mine who wanted someone to manage her business, but the idea flopped because of COVID restrictions and because my friend turned out to be unreliable and unhelpful. It devastated her to lose that opportunity. She spent a thousand hours working on the business plan and reaching out to potential clients, just have it fall apart after all her planning. It was just so painful for her.

She's been through one heartache and disappointment after another and now she is sitting in an ER waiting to find out if she had a heart attack this morning. It's just going to end up as another collections letter in a couple of months. I don't know what to do. How do I comfort someone who lost everything and whose education, intelligence, and experience don't seem to mean anything to anyone?

More than anything, I just feel like everything is wrong. How does a person like her, as talented, caring, kind, friendly, and intelligent as she is have to go through so much when she could be doing so well for herself? The weeks coming up are going to be hard for her while she stresses out over what can be wrong and she falls into another hole of sadness, feeling like she's been left behind in the world.

 I don't drink or smoke weed or do drugs at all, I feel like what my interests are it is so far out of the norm of things I feel as if there is no connection for me at all.

Ever since being in college for likely longer than I like to say, I feel like I can't get past these barriers, and even for a job and even looking for one I feel like no one is really interested so there is another barrier there. I feel the only reason I'm still going is that I know how much it's hurt my mother and siblings if I killed myself, but I think about it some of the time as I feel like I don't have a big enough impact on them.

I got told that I looked like I wanted attention because of my hair, that I use so much makeup because I hate myself, that I probably have 'daddy issues' and cause loads of drama among other things. This couldn't be further from the truth. I consider myself to be a very kind and caring/understanding person. I wear a lot of eye makeup because I like how it looks and I have a fantastic relationship with my dad. I don't understand how people could come to them conclusions after just seeing one photo. I know it's my fault for posting there and that is literally what the sub is for but I really didn't think it would be that specific. There has been girls who have pink hair and wear a lot of makeup also post there and they get nothing but praise, undoubtedly because they are a lot more attractive than me.

I’ve been with my partner for 3.5 years now, we’re high school sweethearts, I’m 19 and she’s 20, cute right. We have a little fat cat together and we’re actually looking after her 15 year old brother too because things aren’t great at their parents home. 

We’ve been in a rough stage for about the last year and it’s over two main things; she can be very controlling and also she hates when I drink. She’s controlling in the way that she goes through my phone and when I’m out she has to know where I am, who I’m with, what I’m doing at all times. I’m quite the opposite, she can be with anyone, hangout anywhere and do whatever she likes, I don’t care if she comes home at 5am, it doesn’t bother me at all because I trust her, she just doesn’t trust me. I’ve never cheated or anything, the lack of trust has no roots, it’s just how she is. The thing that hurts the most is we fight about me partying and drinking with friends, I’m 19 and I love a good time, like any Aussie. I’m the proclaimed “sesh king” of my group because I will get on it anytime, any day aslong as I don’t have work. I’m not a violent person at all, I don’t have an angry bone in my body, it’s not like I come home and beat her, I come home and cuddle and cook us food which then I can’t eat because I’m too drunk and it’ll make me spew, that’s my routine. She just can’t stand it and in the past waking up to her crying and screaming at me, I’ve made empty promises that I’ll never do it again, I’ll quit drinking and the longest I’ve gone is 3weeks, I don’t want to give up drinking, i don’t think it’s the alcohol itself, it’s the fun I have with my friends. I just don’t know if I’m being unreasonable? Should I try and change again and not drink just to make her happy? I’d never ask her to change.

-

still missing her, i rubbed the sleep out of my eyes and went to my home office to look her up on facebook. she was older and had gained weight but she was still had plenty of beauty.  pictures say she made for a very charming bride. eventually i scrolled through her photos long enough to find some from when we were together. it was hard to believe how young she looked or how much time has passed. i'm not sure why but i saved a handful of those images to my computer. as soon as i was done i felt the paranoid concern that she would get a facebook alert about my saving some of her 2011 pics. we are on talking terms and her husband is a really cool guy... but it would be hard to explain why i was revisiting ancient history.

-

i'm not sure why but one-by-one i started to look up every woman i had been intimate with. the list was longer than i thought it would be. most of them had wedding pictures near the top of their photos and it was strangely reassuring to see that they were happy and taken care of. why do brides always look so heavenly? there was a time when seeing one of them in a wedding dress would have made me bitter. but today, even though i miss them its comforting to know that they are getting what they need out of life. they are getting a kind of love i couldn't give them. a few of them are dating seemingly good men. from what they allow facebook to see, they seem happy enough. i hope they get married with kids too, if thats what they are looking for.

-

some of them aren't doing as great. one is locked up in a monotonous marriage with a couple kids. she txts me every few years in an attempt to get the emotional intimacy her husband is incapable of. even though i might miss her the most, i can't allow myself to indulge that. another is struggling with an autoimmune disorder and some mental health issues. there is nothing i can do to help either of them, just remain in their past. its frustrating. 

-

by the end of it all i had an old photo collection important people. they will always be special to me. suddenly i realized that thinking about all those good time left me with a solid erection. it was the type of boner that can't be bought with porn. that sort of thing needs love to grow. shamefully, i had a really solid fap session. it was the best i had in a while because these happy endings actually happened once upon a time. more importantly, i know that these women would approve. it wouldn't have felt good if i knew there was a chance they didn't. still, it would have been more enjoyable if i could somehow have gotten their permission for this. how would that conversation even go? ""so many years from now when you have moved on, do you think i could still tug one out to these memories once in a while?"" its a shame that i can't share this with them now, no need to make things awkward. no need to cause tension with boyfriends and husbands.

-

so here i am in the autumn years of my dating life. i'm starting to wonder if i will ever have sex again. even if i do it wont be with woman so young and beautiful. but at least i have a collection of fond memories. i wonder if they dream about me too...",12Nov2020,1

But it feels like, instead of controlling my anger, I'm just bottling it up and one day i'll explode. And I did, a few days back, but not in front of anyone, I was just with myself and was writing in my journal and just started smashing my pen on my diary until the pen broke. 

For example, if it's a person i'm getting angry on, and I control my anger instead of arguing or fighting with him or showing my anger on him, I guess it feels like in the short term, sure it's beneficial, because there's no issues between us. But in the long term, i'll have resentment against the person, which obviously no one wants with his loved ones.

Anywas, I hope you understood what i'm trying to say. In conclusion, I don't have angry reactions anymore as much as I used to, I know it's a good thing but it feels like the anger is accumulating in my mind and might one day make it explode.

95," 2 years ago, I tried to make a rushed promise to Christian God about not returning home in order to get paper napkins. It was something that ocd was telling me to do and I tried to make the promise in order to force myself not do it. I think, I canceled the promise but what if other Gods accepted it?

 The promise was about not returning home in order to get paper napkins. I visualised the promise in order not to make any mistake and I visualised a specific apartment and a specific way back from where I was.

 Today, I was in my childhood home that I share with my brother and my father (different city, different home than the ones on the promise)
 
 My brother returned home in order to stay (no napkin in the story) I was in the bathroom and I heard him entering.

 My thoughts were something similar to this :

- My brother just, entered the house. Oh no. Maybe there is a tiny chance of him getting napkins. I must stop hearing him. I will flush the toilet to make noise. Oh, wait. Due to an other ocd reason, I must not do that. I must act like a normal person and prove to Gods that I just, heard my brother like a normal person. Lets hear my brother til he closes the door in order to prove to Gods that I am acting like a normal person.

 I worry because intrusive thoughts without my will about my brother and napkins were in my head, and then, due to ocd, I wanted to prove to Gods that I am just, hearing my brother entering the house.

 What if it looked like as if I was believing that my brother was returning to get napkins (something that he did not do) and that I wanted to hear him doing it? I never had any goal about it. I would never do that and I did not do it. They were just, 2 seperate events. 

 Maybe, there was a second, that I persuaded myself that my brother is not returning to get napkins, he just, entered home in order to stay. And in the next second (seperate event) I decided to hear my brother closing the door for an other ocd reason. No napkin in the whole story.

 My ocd is like

ocd: maybe you had in your mind that your brother returns to get paper napkins and due to an other ocd reason, you were forced to hear your brother returning to get napkins.",12Nov2020,1

108,"Every day, I get humiliated by my abusive parents and I have no place of my own or no one to help me get myself out of this toxic environment. This country is almost hell on earth. You probably can't imagine how I suffer in this situation as the problems in this country are only found next in North Korea or maybe Venezuela. EVERYTHING you can imagine is sanctioned and there's no freedom or respect to basic human rights. The society is cruel and selfish and the government is totally corrupted and evil and there's no hope in fixing it whatsoever. If you are comparing your government in terms of its ethics and morality to the Iranian government, I'm afraid to tell you that you are so wrong. Just in five days, we have the anniversary of the 2019 Internet blackout in Iran that lasted for a whole week while they kept killing thousands of people on the streets. You can't have your freedom of speech and beliefs and there's no one to seek help and refuge. I am willing to get interviewed for hours just to tell how desperate I am here in this damned country.

Last week I turned 26, but my birthday didn't stop my abusive parents to insult and humiliate me. My father keeps telling me that it was a mistake to ""make children"". I have always felt that I'm an inferior and unwanted being to them that they never asked for. They don't like and accept me for who I am, rather for my achievements. My mom is better than my dad though, and sometimes I dream if I could save her from my dad, too. She doesn't have much money to survive on her own, and she's forced to stay in this unhealthy relationship. He doesn't respect us, and he constantly puts us in the risk of getting infected with COVID-19 as he doesn't believe in it and even putting on a mask is too much for him. Every time, my mom has to ask and warn him of the dangers because he simply does not understand at all.

Being 26, I am still 100% dependent on my parents. I have no money on my own to go out and live for myself. Once I did a cumbersome online job of data entry for someone on the Internet and I could get only $100 in cryptocurrencies after a month or two, and that's the only way for me to get paid or pay from/to the outside world as everything is sanctioned, everything including PayPal, and for good reasons because this government doesn't give any values to its people but it abuses them to take benefits.

Now a little about what I do now and what I have been doing in the last couple of years. I finished high school in 2013 with top grades being a nerdy/geeky student whose teachers always liked and praised him but the corrupted and outdated admission system in Iran that only exists here and in Afghanistan has been a disaster for me ever since. It's not about testing your knowledge, it's rather based on testing how would you often memorize false and incorrect facts in the official school books and memorizing stupid things like a parrot. For example memorizing the exact adverbs or adjectives used in school books' sentences which were most of the time scientifically incorrect, rather than questioning things and really understanding them. I was more inclined towards exploration, experimenting and absorbing the knowledge and towards creativity rather than memorizing. It was more like a stupid spelling bee contest, with completely unrelated but mandatory topics like theology and Arabic among others all in a 5 hours exam which takes place only once in each year.

So after a few years of struggling with the admission system, I ended up in a terrible ""university"" to study electrical engineering although all of this country's universities are outdated and incompetent. I knew I hated that place from day 1 because it has nothing to do with science or learning at all, and it's only there to give people a piece of paper called a degree and wasting my time. It's all about cheating, paying bribes, cramming the night before the exam and getting a fairly good grade without absorbing the knowledge. It doesn't have any professional labs to experiment.

Now I'm just there to avoid getting drafted to the mandatory military service which lasts for two years of torture without even getting paid or even learning some useful and professional skills. The only way to get rid of it is to get out of the country for a travel or studying and never return.

My life is being wasted here... I can't apply to study abroad as it costs too much money for my parents and Germany as an example for affordable education doesn't easily issue visas for students because of political reasons. There's no job for me to get independent unless I work in inhumane ways without spending a dime of the income for 100 years. There's no hope left for me... and I'm writing here because I don't know what to do anymore. I desperately NEED to get out of this situation within a year at max, but everywhere I look are DEAD-ENDS... :'(",12Nov2020,1

It doesn't matter that I have untreated thyroid issues preventing me from loosing weight and actually causing me to gain weight (I'm not going to remind him I'm tired of discussing my weight). I'm tired of hearing about my weight especially since I am dieting he just doesn't seem to like seeing me eat in fact if I eat healthy he wants it or he pretends he was going to eat the celery in the fridge going bad. I know I need to loose weight (I told him before I'm on a diet).

At this point I don't want to try to loose weight anymore because I really don't want to give him the satisfaction, I don't want him to think he had anything to do with it I know it's harming me personally but I just rather not have him think he has anything to do with it even though his opinions are starting to hurt.",12Nov2020,1

I wanted to ask advice and get someone else’s take on my life so far.

A little about me:

Age: 28

Gender: male

Illnesses: BPD, ADD, Severe depression, Dyslexia

Let me start at the beginning. I was born in Los Angeles and moved to Missouri when I was four. This is when things got a little rough. When I started reading I had a lot of trouble because I was undiagnosed with dyslexia. It was my first brush with low self-esteem. I was homeschool from first grade until 8th grade. Being homeschooled is the loneliest experience. I only got to see people once a week at a homeschool meets up. Homeschooling means spending a lot of time with family specifically my mom who, from time to time, had a bad temper and pretty much gave up on my education. I never developed any organization skills or how to study for a test, how to work thru homework assignments. My brother was also prone to have severe temper tantrums which stifled my education because the focus was almost exclusively on him. I tried to make friends with some success but I suffered from painful shyness. For example if I was with a friend and they invited some of their friends to hang out with us, I wouldn’t talk and be silent.

I begged my parents to not be homeschooled anymore because I couldn’t bear being alone so much. After many fights they decided to send me to a small Christian school of 80 people. I tested a grade lower that my age, so when I was supposed to be in 9th grade I was in 8th. My first year was awful. I never spoke to anyone in my class or anyone at all. Around this time I developed severe acne that made it hard for me to look other people in the eye.

The biggest issue was that the workload was so huge that you almost had no time for anything else. Like I said before I had no academic skills. I did so poorly throughout high school mostly getting c's, d's, and f's in my classes. This was a huge problem and created a rift between me and my parents. At the time I really blamed myself for doing so poorly. I feel now that I was ill-prepared ad that is my parents fault for neglecting my education. The school was three days a week. Monday, Wednesday and Friday were in class while Tuesday and Thursday were at home. So like a hybrid of homeschooling and real school. Most days at home my mom would run my homework schedule and often berated me and insulted me for doing so poorly. She would scream in my face saying ""you're going to be a failure"" and would chastise me if I didn’t do things the way she wanted me to. I never was able to rebuild my relationship with my mom after that and she still blames me for those days. It was hard seeing my mom like that. Once she was always there for me, taught me about pain, loved me unconditionally. As soon as I went to school she completely changed and became so cynical and cruel.

My grades caused a lot of problems for me personally. I wasn’t able to get a driver’s license until I was almost 18 because my dad forbade it. I was unable to engage in extracurricular. My dad was verbally and physically abusive to me. He would tell me he was going to kill me. He would humiliate me in front of my friends. He stifled me a lot. He never took the time to think ""maybe he has problems with doing work"" instead of blaming me for being lazy. I'm not lazy. I'm a survivor.

I had many troubling experiences at this school. Most of it was people attacking my appearance and generally disrespecting me. At one point a kid with Asperger's attacked me without reason. I never knew why. It shocked me. Another point a guy with was 6'4 took me a slammed me against a wall in front of people. It really affected me at the time. The worst one was at a soccer game. A lot of people were hanging out when someone I used to know who had graduated attacked my appearance in front of everyone and called me ""fuck ugly"" in front of my brother and a lot of my friends. It was so traumatizing and humiliating. I and friends never spoke about it. I and my brother never spoke about it either. Sometimes when I'm with my brother, I still feel that awkwardness a decade later. I never really understood why it happened and it crippled my self-esteem. I remember going numb. I had to hang out with those people afterwards. There was many times where someone called me ugly including my closest friend. I never really got over it.

Going into college, I was only able to get into the same college my brother got into. Thomas More College. A liberal Arts catholic school with about 80-100 people. There were a lot of the same problems here but things got better. I made some friends including a couple of girls that I grew very close to. It really felt like things were looking up. I started dating a girl who was very pretty. My friends and I even got the change to go to Rome for the spring semester. It was a great time. However, while I was in Rome, my girlfriend was spending alone time with another guy. It made me feel insecure. After Rome I decided to come visit her at school. It was weird. I suspected something happened between them. We broke up and they started dating. I decided to look for a new school to transfer to. I picked out a few schools to major in psychology. I've always loved psychology. However my dad said he would not help me pay for it unless I went to a local school for a business degree. This was pretty devastating.

I ended up going to Truman state university. A school notorious for its huge work load. I found out pretty early that I was not going to do well there. On top of that I had a lot of trouble making friends. Other than my roommates I made no friends at all. My grades were terrible. I became severely depressed and had trouble getting out of bed. It was around this time that I found out that my ex-girlfriend and my brother had started dating. This crippled our relationship to this day. At this point I had just given up. I was so hurt by them dating. I felt like if my brother would stab me in the back, I must really not be worth anything. My whole family was supportive of their relationship. I felt like I was being betrayed by my family.

I eventually flunked out of school and lived with my parents. I got several jobs at the same time to go back to school at a small local college. I still have not finished my degree. I ended up moving out later to live with my oldest friend and got a desk job which I was let go from. Another one which I was also let go from. I finally got a customer service rep job which enabled me to move out on my own. I ended up meeting a girl let’s call her Jane who I dated for 4 months before she broke up with me. She regretted breaking up with me but I cut all ties with her. Not long after that I was fired from my customer service job for failing to give accurate information. Customer service gives me such bad social anxiety and my performance eventually collapse. I eventually worked at a solar company but was fired shortly after that for failing to handle the workload. Jane and I started hanging out a couple times but eventually lost contact because I did not text her at all. I ended up working at a bank. Jane and I reconciled again but she saw me texting what she assumed were other girls and became despondent when we were together. The last night I ever saw her we were so distant and she was on tinder talking to guys to get back at me. I went outside and smoked a cig which she hated. She asked to go home and I told her I would uber her. She was obviously offended and left and when I asked for a hug she was obviously crying. I still love that girl.

I eventually walked out of my bank job because my boss was awful and I couldn’t take working there. Jane had started dating someone else and I started dating a girl named Cat. I eventually got a sales job which raised my social anxiety. Cat was unstable. She would often have fits of crying and needed to be with me constantly which put a lot of pressure on me. I was a mess myself. One day I went a whole day without texting her and she faked a suicide attempt (I found this out later) Jane was always checking my Instagram story and sending me random texts but I never answered. I was still upset about what happened. I broke up with Cat after she trapped me in my house she was afraid I was going to leave her. Around this time I lost my sales job too. I tried several times to get back into school but failed my classes. After all this I moved in with my brother and started ubering for about 5 months and eventually got another customer service job. I ended up moving out this past August where I am now. Jane and I started talking again and eventually decided to meet up. We had so much good conversation but she would leave me on read when I sent her tik toks. A few days before we were supposed to meet up, I sent her tiktoks on Thursday and Friday to start a conversation to meet up and make plans which we had discussed earlier that week but she left me on read. I got upset and stopped talking to her. This was a month ago. I messed up. I wish she had responded so we could make plans. We talk every once in a while but I fear she has found someone else. I wish there was some way to start up our connection with her but I don’t know how. I never felt so loved by someone and I know I messed up. I sent her a message saying I'm glad we started talking again and thanked her for keeping me company during the pandemic. Before that I sent her a message saying I loved her and she started getting concerned about me. I think it might be over. I can't accept it though because I don't like anyone else.

Now, I'm currently still working a customer service job which I hate. I am not doing well. I am on my final warning before I get fired. I'm looking for a new job for about 3 weeks. Nothing has happened but got a few interviews. Still got to get back into school but I need more money. Got a second job at the sunglass hut to pay for it. My car is not registered because I have so much work to do on it to get it registered. My credit isn’t good. I go to therapy and a psychiatrist. Unfortunately there are not a lot of options for borderline personality disorder. I'm working on it. I feel like bpd has stifled me my entire life.

I want to change my life. I want to be successful. I want a good relationship. Right now I have virtually no friends. On Friday and Saturday nights I spend them alone. I want good friends. I want a steady job that works for me. I started working out and eating well but It only makes me feel better for so long. I want to have hope that my life will change.

Please, any advise would help. I'm getting desperate to change. I just cant seem to fix myself. This is something I wanted to do for a while. I just want to be happy.",12Nov2020,1

112,"I don’t hate it simply because of the way people view me. I don’t know why it makes me feel uncomfortable. I wish I could delete that part of myself. 

People always thought I was gay and now if I come out they’ll all be proved right. That a a big part of it. I’m not actually gay, I’m bi but guys all think I’m gay because I don’t dress feminine, my voice isn’t pretty and soprano and I’m a loud, rowdy person. I played rugby for nearly 10 years and can get aggressive. Not good qualities but I think especially bad when you’re a women. People expect those things from men but label women as bitchy or whatever the modern equivalent of a shrew is. They made fun of my clothes, my personality, my appearance, my speech. It wasn’t bad but it makes me hate that part that will prove them all right. 

That’s not all of it. I struggle with the sexual part of relationships. Society focuses so much on the sexual bit when judging gay people. And I think that within the community itself there’s also focus on sexual freedom and expression which is great but it’s not something I want to be the focus of a relationship. When people talk about being gay there’s often discussion (often behind their backs) about the sexual nature of the relationship - how does it work etc and I hate that that’s the first thing people talk about. 

Maybe that’s society in general moving towards a sexually liberated way of living. I just don’t feel comfortable with the assumption from potential romantic interests, from friends, that I’m just gonna go straight to shagging. I had a bad first experience so maybe that’s where it comes from idk.",12Nov2020,1
114,"We've talked about our teenage years a handful of time and each time he says he wish we knew each other back then. At first, he would jokingly say how we would be such good friends because we both troubled teens.

But the other day we went into depth about our adolescence on a more serious note. I could tell he was sincere when he said he wish we knew each other back then. This time I replied if we knew each other back when we were toxic we would hate each other today. He contests we would've helped each other through our mess.

It warms my heart every time he says that. But I had to let him know that back then I thought I was *entitled* to peoples love and attention. I didn't realize people were making an everyday choice to love/care about me and be my friend. I acted like my parents were in debt to me. I didn't appreciate anyone.

Our character is built off our past. I'm able to appreciate him in my life and I like the man who he is today.",12Nov2020,1
115,"So, I was just sitting in an arena minding my business at this ren fair the other day waiting for one of the shows to start. Every other row is blocked off and every other seat has an X on it and I sit in the proper seat. Everyone for the most part if following the rules. Then two ladies with kids with a stroller sit directly behind me which is a row that is blocked off and has an X on it even though there is a seat without an X right next to it, but they seemed intent on sitting as close to someone has possible. Then their kid drinks soda and leaves the soda cap right next to my jacket, so I politely ask them to maybe move it, and then I don’t mind it for the most part as long as they are like chill and don’t touch me or anything. But then the kid tried to touch me! In covid! And one of the ladies was elderly and I am a college kid, so I was concerned for their health more than mine. I politely again ask them to maybe at least scoot over to the bench right next to them without an X at which one of the women blows up at and starts saying the F word and says I should fkn move and says I probably “have it all over me”. In shock, I turn back around with her continuing to shout profanity and call me a libtard (?) and I just bolt right out of there (even though I should have recorded it) because I didn’t want to escalate it and risk her spitting on me or hitting me judging from how batshit she was already acting because god forbid she should move over to a bench right next to her for the health of her young kids and elderly person but idek. 

So yeah, I’m never risking sitting next to or talking to middle aged white women who sit next to me (especially with kids) ever ever again. Learned my lesson. Just leave the second they target you.",12Nov2020,1

129,"So I’ve been trying for ages and ages to meet someone I’d like to be in a relationship with and around 8 months ago I met a girl off a dating app and she was the first I felt a genuine connection with.

Roll on a month of talking etc and we entered lockdown so we was unable to meet really although it turned out she was also meeting another guy at the same time and as she ended up meeting him they progressed quicker than me and her did.

Eventually she told me that she felt a connection with me but she was also progressing things with the other guy so we should be friends.

Over the coming months we had developed a deep connection and we are literally the same person in terms of interests and we’ve always been there for each other when needed. 

Then a couple of weeks ago I decided to do some Christmas shopping before we entered another lockdown and she asked if she could come, which bear in mind this is the first time we had met must’ve gone very well because I knew she was having trouble with her boyfriend as they were polar opposites but they both mutually agreed to be friends and decided to give things a go with me.

Due to knowing each other for so long we decided to skip the whole getting to know each other stage etc and we’ve met up nearly everyday we’ve been free for the last few weeks and we both agree things are going very well and she said she wished she had picked me in the first place and We both couldn’t be happier.",12Nov2020,1

I feel so stuck not knowing what to do. My brain knows that logically we should end it but my heart wants to hold on to hope.

137,"My parents are Korean immigrants who focused completely on my path to college, rather than giving me opportunities to have fun and develop my social skills. I was a really lonely kid because the only activities I did were things my parents wanted me to do for college applications. I wasn't interesting to talk to for a long time and struggled a lot with making friends. All I was good at was school. I went to a good college and graduated and now I work a decent job, but I still feel lasting loneliness and bitterness from the experiences I missed out on as a child.

One instance that I particularly focus on is summer camp. I convinced my parents to let me go to summer camp with my best friend the summer after 7th grade. I had an amazing time, spent a month away from my parents, and made incredible friends. I even had a crush who told me he liked me and couldn't wait to spend the next summer with me. When I got home, my parents told me that I couldn't go back because it was too much time not doing anything academic. They know how much going back to camp meant to me -- I spent months trying to convince them to let me go back. I fell out of touch with my camp friends since they went for several years after me and we didn't live close enough to hang out at home. They were the closest friends I had at the time, since I didn't have any friends at school. I spent my following summers at academic camps I didn't learn anything from while social media told me that my camp friends were having a great time getting closer to each other and sometimes even falling in love. I even lost touch with my best friend because she moved away and the only chance I'd have to see her was at camp.

I know that holding onto these memories are extremely childish, but I can't help but feel that my life would have been dramatically different if I had been allowed to just be a kid. Now, I'm an adult with the knowledge that I can never have a great experience like middle school summer camp. I have virtually no friends from my childhood, while I know countless people who have lifelong friends from summer camp and fun experiences when they were young. I've mostly forgotten about this since it's been so long, but it'll sometimes pop up in my brain and I'll just feel overwhelmingly bitter again. I know that my experiences making friends would have been way more beneficial for my life than all of the academic camps I had to do. I feel nostalgic all the time for what my dream of an ideal childhood is. 

I am currently talking about this with my therapist but I'd love to hear if anyone else has advice or similar stories. Has anyone else worked through similar resentment towards their parents?",12Nov2020,1

Please make this experience stop.",12Nov2020,1
