Trying to puff up my biceps and triceps, as well as pecs. They all feel so numb and I love it. I haven’t worked out consistently in years honestly.

I'm a 27 year old guy, in a foreign country studying masters, with a huge student loan debt, long term gf in another country pursuing her masters, who struggles from a ton of anxiety and other emotional issues, parents in home country don't talk to each other in spite of living in the same house (long story short we are from third world country so divorce is very uncommon so my parents are together for my sake), but I do love them from the bottom of my heart and just want to show them the world and keep them happy. With covid it's the worst time to graduate and I'm working part time so that I don't go into more debt, even during my dissertation period. Upon that being socially awkward and not a good looking guy I guess I have zero friends in my life right now. The only wish I got was from my gf and family.
I was a kid at heart who always laughed at silly stuff and never took things in life seriously, always looked at the world positively. But now I have seen and experienced so much the past few months that I barely smile and when I do it's just feels fake af.
I just want to get over with this shitty feeling of constant pressure and loneliness.
I guess world is just a shitty place for someone like me and hope it gets better eventually.

4,"Hey everyone, 

I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I am trying to get tested for COVID because one of my coworkers tested positive. My manager recommended a place to me that has tests that give results in 15 minutes. The place seems legit enough but it seems strange to me that these tests are not available everywhere and the fact that there is not a significant amount of media coverage about this from what I've seen.

So my question is whether or not these tests can be trusted and if there are any benefits of getting the test that takes longer to receive results over this test?

Thanks",21Jul2020,1
5,"I used to write in high school. I had a blog for my school newspaper, of which I was the editor-in-chief. Most of my 70 something posts got under 5 views, most views came from refreshing my page. That was fine when I was getting a class credit to create, as I wasn't leaning on external validation as much as I was trying to get a good grade. I told myself I'd keep writing after high school, and I did for a month or two, but shouting into the void (incidentally the title of one of my posts) was too demoralizing.

I think it's that I want to be heard. I now get that fix from reddit, posting and commenting and eagerly waiting for the envelope to turn orange. I've considered every media medium I can think of: comic strips, youtube videos, podcasting, music, newsletters, etc. But then I look at the talent of the world and I feel inadequate. I genuinely cannot see a world where people would be interested in what I have to say. I almost pursued a career in higher education to fulfill my ego, but I knew that would be destructive.

Even if I were to start making content, I don't know what it would be about. I'm a jack of all trades, master of none. I have a basic knowledge and interest in philosophy, science, math, computer science, business, comedy, animals, nature, politics, and relationships. But I can't see myself writing about just one of those week in and week out, and unfortunately, successful content creators usually must carve out a niche.

I think this is a self esteem issue. I want people to think highly of me. I want people to care about my thoughts. I'm shallow and egotistical. I've been fighting off that disease for as long as I can remember. I don't know if it's healthier to pursue creation as a fulfilling habit or to give up on this dream of being praised. Maybe there is something to be said in favor of creating without an audience, but I did that for 3 years, and it's fucking depressing after a certain point. Even if I just had 1 regular reader. None of my friends read any of my posts. My parents didn't read every post. My teacher even stopped reading after a bit. I cannot come to terms with the fact in a world with an abundance of talent that I have nothing creative to offer.",21Jul2020,1

9,"I'm gonna keep this post brief - but I've got a lot to say, so I'm gonna add to it over the next few days I think.

Anyway, I have been thinking about this a lot, power and control, for myself lately.  And then I saw a comment in the 'racism' section.  Someone who had been educated at Uni who had studied 'power and control' at a degree level and felt that it was simple to understand and didn't go further into it.

I felt, lucky you, I guess for some people power and control would be simple if you study it in depth at an academic level where you'd study it from an observer point of view, but 'power and control' is something I'm learning on a day to day basis and still learning about it.

You see, for me I have a fair few very toxic people around me, first person was my step-father - who is now off the radar and has been for a long time.  (Mum got a divorced, he affected us both).  Then from relationships with ex boyfriends and the odd boss here and there.

I'm not going to write this as a 'poor me' as I'm not wanting sympathy - it's just going to be a discussion about 'power and control', a bit about why it's taking me so long to understand 'power and control', and I'm not going to go too deeply into what they did.

It makes me want to have a discussion about it - as there is so much power and control in the world - and all of us are exposed to it, in different ways, from different groups.

I'm gonna leave my post here for tonight - as I've realised I'm gonna write about it in short bursts over a period of time.  As I can't mention everything I'm gonna say - on one long post.  As I will be focusing more on the personality types of people who are more likely to be controlling over others, rather than focus on the victims.

I'll be focusing on it, using a psychological perspective, because I know about that and feel comfortable about that.  Obviously there are plenty of different perspectives, but I probably won't cover as I'm not knowledgeable about it.  So I won't be sharing much about myself, i'm just gonna talk about control in a more general sense, and focus more on gaslighting I think. But I'll save it for tomorrow, cos I've got quite a lot to say.",21Jul2020,1

11,"My brother (28) has made suicidal remarks over several years. However, now he is making these statements a lot more regularly and I am becoming increasingly worried. I don't know what to do and I need help.

Here's the thing: my family and I are tired. Like I mentioned, he has been saying these things for years. And his reasoning? Because my family wants him to start taking responsibility for his own life. He doesn't work full time, doesn't go to school, doesn't cook or clean or help around the house. He doesn't do...... anything. My parents have been paying all his bills and housing him since he entered adulthood. He claims that being given chores during childhood and having to enter a new middle school (with unfamiliar classmates) have ""rewired"" his brain and that it makes it him suicidal.

He recently had an incident outside of our home which caused neighbors to call the police. The police were unable to do much because he is an adult and my brother claimed he was fine and didn't need help. The day after my parents sat him down to talk. It wasn't very effective tbh but they tried. Anytime they asked him to start working full time or to start paying bills, he claimed doing so would cause him to kill himself. 

My sister and I have tried getting thru with no avail. I have sympathized + validated with his feelings. I live thousands of miles away; I have offered to fly him out if he needs the space. Nothing works. Part of the issue is he thinks he's had it harder than my sister and I (which truthfully is the total opposite; if you are Latinx you know girls have it MUCH tougher, and my sister and I have had to handle our own finances since exiting high school). So he thinks he has experienced ""worse"" trauma than us. 

I would like to add here that I have worked with children in foster care who have experienced trauma. My degree also focused on child health which had a heavy focus on adverse childhood experiences. I can tell you now that our childhoods, while not perfect, were not traumatic. So unless there is some unknown traumatic experience we are unaware of (which, up to this point, he has not brought up as a reason for being suicidal), he really is making a big deal out of nothing (FYI I have \*NEVER\* told him this; I have always validated his feelings because at the end of the day, we all process experiences differently). I hate to say it (because of his suicidal tendencies) but he has been spoiled, and now it's turned into this. And if you're wondering why I am mentioning this it's because it adds to the exhaustion my family and I feel - that's not to say I wish my brother had experienced real trauma, however, it becomes exhausting to sympathize with someone who has been making suicidal threats for 10 years because of having to be a responsible adult and the ""trauma"" of having chores.

My family and I are at the point that we don't know what to do. My parents are not getting any younger; they are tired. They have given him everything, including paying for a psychiatrist, psychologist, and medicine (and honestly have spoiled him) and now we're at this point....

I don't want to wake up to a phone call that my brother was found dead. But I do not know what to do. Please, I am asking for help - if there is anyone with experience in this, please, I'll take any advice you can give.

Thank you.",21Jul2020,1
12,"Only recently i got to know about this term and disorder and straightaway associated with it.

I have been daydreaming since atleast my 8th standard when I was around 13 years old, as far as I can remember. Currently i am a graduate and going to be 23 in 10 days.

The daydreaming might have been there before as well, but as far as i can remember, in 8th class i got this hugeeeeee crush on a guy in my class which really made my daydreams last for hours straight. Like I would start with talking and reacting alone in my room as if I am talking to a real person. That too sometimes for 3-4 hours straight.

The scenarios i used to imagine were quite unrealistic but not supernatural as such. Like we used to tease each other, fight with each other a lotttt but hardly there was any relevant talking between us. He never had an idea i had a crush on him. And maybe that perpetuated the daydreaming to a v high level that i almost failed my 8th standard. I wasn’t able to concentrate on anything at that time.

During next 4 yrs of school as well, the daydreaming was less intense but still somehow it was there. I wasn’t good in studies a lot so i think i did try to concentrate more on studies rather than daydreaming. I can’t remember so much accurately, but yes, my everyday schedule esp studies where whacked cause of this.

College was a shitty place for me too, so i hardly imagined a lot of things then. But as soon as it ended which was 2 yrs ago, i started imagining a  lot of stuff which could have happened in cllg with me but had the least possibility.

Cut to now, I am trying to study for my Psychology entrance exam which could happen anytime as soon as the COVID exists or maybe someone invents a good vaccine which my country can afford to buy, lol (i live in Delhi, India). And nowadays those extreme levels of daydreaming is back. And my thoughts are constantly stuck to my school days, probably the last 2 yrs of it. And the daydreams are highly imaginative. I am assuming my school life wasn’t v great either and i hardly made any friends cause of a lot of things and used anger as a defence mechanism, so maybe cause of that i am daydreaming something pleasant, like having fun with ppl around in school, having lots of friends and so on. But the daydreams are v detailed in a way that i am acting in my room as if i am having real convos with someone.

Over the yrs i have also imagined around the scenarios where i got the the chance to speak or act like i wanted to but never. Like in cases of family, there have been certain times where i wanted to confront someone for something but refrained only to daydream that later.

Plus during daydreaming I have cried, laughed, acted out the whole scene as if a stage show is going on, literally. I have done that all in my room without letting anyone else know ever. And i have recently realized my daydreams have more or less been related to those parts of my life where i couldn’t or wasn’t myself. Like maybe if i would have confessed to my crush at that time those bizarre daydreams might have never happened. Or maybe confronted to my family members at a given time. And so on.

Also I have noticed in myself getting highly influenced by movies, shows and interviews, esp of the celebs i like.
I have literally spent hours acting as if i am giving interviews. And sometimes a movie would get to me so much that i would start acting out a few scenes in my room out of nowhere.

And ofcourse, it’s making my entrance prep v difficult and has always made my concentration levels hit like it has now.

Do I have Maladaptive Daydreaming!? Should I start therapy for the same asap!???

26,"I don't know what is going on, but since the whole lockdown situation hit in spring, probably even before that, not one day has passed where I haven't felt tired as shit.

My sleep schedule is so messed up, every goddamn time I sleep at a normal time I fuck it up after a week and go back to my usual schedule of falling asleep at sunrise, waking up in the afternoon and feeling tired the entire ""day"". It's not that I'm not getting enough sleep, I'm sleeping like 10 hours on average. And this is not the kind of tired that goes away with more sleep.

Every fucking day I feel incapacitated, like I want to do things but I'm just too tired to do them, but I can never fall asleep either. The end result is that I spend hours of my day just sitting at bed, not doing anything productive, not doing anything I enjoy, just... existing.

Over the last few months I've been feeling like shit, I never get anything done, I've failed many of my university courses (which I gave my all a few years ago in order to even have the chance to attend), I'm slowly drifting away from the few friends I have, my relationship with my family is deteriorating... I rarely talk with the people in my own house about anything other than mundane shit and it's driving me crazy.

Whenever I talk to my parents about anything it feels like I'm defusing a bomb, like if I say the wrong thing they'll snap and I'll feel like a piece if shit afterwards for arguing with them. I'm too afraid to talk to them about anything that's bothering me. It's not because I'm afraid of physical violence or anything, but I just have a fear of talking to them, every time I try to express my feelings something inside of me just holds back and I can't do it.

27,"So im 19, im from Birmingham in the UK. I did pretty well in school up in till 16, I went to an all boys school (not one that you pay for but you had to pass a test to get in). I did well in my exams at 16. I was selling packs off the dark web at the time, giving them to a dealer (my age) who would sell them and then return the money plus some profit to me (he screwed me multiple times after about 30 runs). This involved buying bitcoin and the guy who I was buying it from offered me a job where I would take orders using natwest ""get cash"" at the ATMs which allowed you to put in a 6 digit code and get up to £130 from the atm, this meant I had his login and acces to some of his bitcoin. I did this for about 4 months before the guy who was selling for me (weed, MDMA and cocaine) got me into weed and I stole the bitcoin in the wallet (£2,400) for me to buy weed with (I was buying an oz every day for weeks). I then set up the guy selling bitcoin and robbed him for £5000 after sixth form (school). Which I ended up getting kicked out of for having weed on me.

I was then addicted to weed and to get money for it I would steal off my parents, this went on for months with me stealing 1000s of pounds and smoking kilos on kilos untill eventually they disowned me at 17 and left me on the streets. I had now met some serious gangsters (who stabbed people, one had been to prision for an attempted murder) and he let me stay at his house. To make money to survive he suggested I do county lines (going to a village/town in the countryside to sell crack and heroin for a gang) I did this and long story short the gang tried to do me over so I robbed them and came back to birmingham. This gangster was sick of me staying at his place so I got into a care home. Whilst I was there I robbed a food delivery truck to eat. I also got into lots of fights and ended up getting stabbed twice in the legs and beaten up many times. I ended up getting kicked out of the care home for breaking the rules three times and ended back on the streets sleeping in a car. There was a service provided by the council where I met up with my parents once a week to talk and they eventually let me stay at home again.

I continued to smoke **lots** of weed and ended up developing cannabis psychosis where I was hearing voices (I had also taken acid many times this is definatley a factor) but the voices got worse and worse and I was talking to them all day and night and my parents took me to a hospital for an assessment. They ended up sectioning me (forcing me to go to mental hospital against my will) and I ended up staying there for 3 months (I even made a [VLOG](https://youtu.be/IKMA8rRoMn8) ). Once I was released I had no friends really as the gangster ones were mostly toxic manipulative people so I cut them off and I didnt talk to anyone from school. I was depressed and alone for months untill I rekindled it with and old school friend and we ended up taking MDMA together a few times and one of the gangsters who was good became close again. My depression also went (permanatley) away after taking ketamine (its a miracle drug) and my life is good now. If you read this far I love you leave a comment!",21Jul2020,0

So, four months ago my fiance and I had a beautiful baby boy. We also have a ten year old daughter.

I have post partum depression but have been on medication for 3 months now and it seems to be helping, woo-hoo!  I still am very anxious and emotional but I'm handling things better, I even have a phone therapist that I talk to weekly about life with a new baby.

Things were going great and everything seemed as good as it can be given the state of things in the world. About a month ago I found out that my dad has a massive brain tumor and he was rushed to a bigger hospital in a different city to see a neurologist. The tumor is really affecting him, he is losing vision, gets confused and easily forgetful, plus the massive headaches. He wouldn't let them remove it for a full biopsy because he was told he would go completely blind. They instead took a small sample.

My parents came back home, the hospital is about 5 hours away, and were waiting to hear back from the cancer clinic. They got the call and drove back. I hadn't heard anything from them and it was very nerve racking knowing what he is going through and not knowing how my mother is coping.

Found out that the treatment they could do wouldn't really prolong his life much at all and he would be in the hospital and be very ill and possibly lose his ability to speak amongst other things. So he declined treatment and came home. He possibly has three to six months to live. He of course is taking time to process this news, as we all are.

My mom is trying to get homecare to come help with my dad but he is being very uncooperative and its affecting my moms health, she is not a very healthy woman. I'm so frustrated and upset because he won't let us come and see him, I am so worried that my daughter won't get to see him before he passes and she is very close with him... I guess I am worried he won't let any of us see him. One of my siblings is coming to live with them to help my mom so I am thankful for that.

The thought of this being my only career in my life never bothered me, the way I see it, eventhough I'm not crazy about it, I like being able to pay my bills, get groceries, get a nice tv and gym memberships without freakingout over how much money I have left. I always was told to not work for money but follow a passion and I've read where some people left a decent paying job for something that makes them happy but now earn alot less and that kind of thinking bewilders me. Tbh, I dont know what makes me happy but I like freedom though.


I'm not a huge risk taker either, I went camping with a few friends  last year, and I got called jokingly a bore because I didn't want to eat random barries that they found and get very drunk next to the camp fire. I don't mean this in a condescending way but I'm not big on being drunk and on any substance that could impair my mental state. I wanted to be sober, because I'm always kinda thinking what if something terrible happens, a wild animal or some crazy person, and I dont mind going to partys but being drunk or high around other drunk or high strangers just doesn't sit well with me. I can have fun within reason, but the whole fuck it lets just an adventure I just don't really care for, but Im not judging others though. I'm wondering if I'm going ghrough life too bland, or too uptight?",21Jul2020,1
51,"Some years ago, feeling lost and with nothing to lose, I started to experiment with psychedelics. LSD was particularly attractive at first because it's cheap where I live and it lasted a long time. After mjcrodosing for a while, I tried a full dose and loved it. Then I tied doubles. Then smokjng weed on top of it. And finally it happened, I had a bad trip that completely racked my brain.
I've heard of them before, and had friends who have been through them, but I wasn't ready for the feeling of losing my sanity and being so out of control. It was a living hell. At one point, I begged a friend to beat the shit out of me just so I would be unconscious, before another friend talked me down and eventually dug me out of the trip.
Every time I smoked weed afterwards I felt the deep, raking anxiety come over me. It was inescapable. As the anxiety started dying down when I smoked I thought it was the end, but then it started happening when I was drunk. I felt like I left a piece of myself ""up there"", and I couldn't get it back.
I started becoming irritable, paranoid at times. I sent two relationships to shit because of irrational paranoia, it's worth mentioning I've had several close encounters with death, either accidents or fights, but that didn't affect me near as much as this experience.
In my desperation, I tried mushrooms. Stupid idea, I know, but it was a heavenly trip, and I felt soothed to my soul. Afterwards, I tried to replicate the experience but the anxiety had returned and it became another living hell.
I went sober for a while, completely, caffeine and all, even nofap for months. It didn't help either. Eventually, I noticed my kind just ""went"" even when being completely sober and in a safe space. Then I got COVID.

I had confusion attacks for five days, feeling like I was stuck in a bad comeup. It was beyond horrible. I found all of my childhood GameCube games and finished them all, playing compulsively to try and drown out the noise. It worked for a while, things were good and I felt normal. But then, one day, I was just sitting and I felt like my consciousness slipped, like it was on a wet rock and just ""fell off"". It's gotten worse since.

I'm at my wits end. There's a family history of alzheimers too, and I noticed my short term memory becoming near nonexistent. I have trouble keeping interest in the most basic of details. I was also totally extroverted before, feeling like people gave me energy, but now even among friends I'm afraid of them. I'm afraid of people I trusted. I randomly have the uncontrollable urge to exit conversations and hide, like an animal.

Even in quarantine I found myself avoiding my roommates. Hiding in my room and waiting until they were busy to eat or go outside. I can't explain it, beyond not trusting myself to stay sane and wanting to hide my problem. I've tried going to a psychologist, but my university has a strict anti drug policy that would probably land me in jail, and I don't have the budget to afford outside help, so I eventually stopped seeking external aid.

Now, I've begun writing to try and get all my ramblings on paper, and I've found peace in it, but the attacks persist. I'm afraid I've fucked myself up permanently, and I'm terrified of what might happen if I don't do something. At the same time, I've seen my grandfather deteriorate from alzheimers at age 93, and I see the same symptoms in myself. I don't know what to do, or where to run. I try to stay busy all day, working twelve, sometimes fourteen hours a day, and this still happens. My mind just goes. I suddenly became incapable of forming new relationships because I forget the most basic things about other people and find myself saying things that would obviously seem hurtful to anyone who actually remembered past conversations, but I just can't.

I don't think I'm a potential self harm case, just self fear, but that fear just grows. I'm siting this at three AM because I have a feeling others like me are also nocturnal, and I hope someone has been through something similar.

Now, think about this, my friend is 22 and if her mom was 36, her mom would have had to give her birth when she was 14. Does that make any sense at all?

63,"**TL;DR: When friends always “forget” to Invite you, it starts to feel like their doing it on purpose**

.I am upset because I feel like I am good friends with the people I met in high school. I feel like I have spent hours making connections with all these people that I consider my good friends. When friends constantly “forget to Invite you” it begins to feel like they are doing it on purpose.  

I understand that we are all moving on in our lives with school and jobs, and I cant fault anyone for that. I am upset because I know there is limited time till everyone goes back to school. When I see that all of my friends are hanging out together in a photo and they seemingly haven’t even thought to invite me, it hurts my feelings. 

The first time, I was told “we forgot and started drinking already, but we are really sorry.” So I brush it off and it's no big deal. The second time it happens, I think okay well this sucks, but i'm not sure if its an accident anymore. So I talked to one of my friends that was with everyone. He again proceeded to tell me that it was an accident and they really didn’t mean to. He tells me that it truly was an accident and they wouldn’t purposely leave me out. 

At this point i'm not sure if some of them actually wouldn’t like me there. I feel the person I'm speaking with can't say for the whole group. Regardless, I once again brush it off. The very next day, they were all planning to hang out. I am especially upset that there was a plan to hangout the next day, and it didn’t even cross the mind of the person I was talking to. Maybe it did cross their mind, and I can accept that if it’s true.

At this point I feel some of the people I consider close friends, don’t want to hang out with me when they have time to. If this is the case, I can accept that fact. Although, I don’t think it’s fair to lead someone on, just because you feel bad to say it. I would like to know if anyone doesn’t enjoy hanging out with me. It doesn’t feel fair to waste either one of our time if one side truly does not enjoy being around the other one or if they don’t consider them a friend anymore.",21Jul2020,9
64,"I (M17) am French so apologies if I make English mistakes. And also I don't know the very exacts numbers. 

My parents weren't really in need of money during their life. My father(M68) was the director of communication in a  company, and was making about 8,000$ a month, he is now retired and gets about 4,500$ each month thanks to his former company, but he is the worst person to manage money, everytime he has money, he spends it. He has no economy on his accounts and no real estate. My mother(F56) has her own small company and a few years ago she was managing to make about 200,000$ a year for the company, she also has 4 appartments, but only 2 and a half on which she gets rents.

In 2014, my parents decided to get married, and buy a house together. The house was about 800,000$ including taxes/agencies and notary fees, my mom had about 140,000$ to pay directly, but they had to make a loan to the bank to pay the rest.

To pay back the loan they need to give to the bank, 540,000$ every month, as I was saying my dad doesn't know how to manage money and instead of paying the half of those 5,400$ he everytime pays like 30% of it even less sometimes.

With her company my mom was managing to pay the other 70% but lately her company didn't work well so they started to be late of 1 month, a little later by 2 months and because of coronavirus, she had to pause her company and we are now late of 3 months so 3 paiements of 5,400$, a few days ago, because of this delay we received a letter from the bank saying that they are denouncing the contract and that we had 60 days to pay back the full 460,000$ we owe + 35,000$ fees for repaying a loan earlier, and if we don't they are seizing the house.

So we are selling one of my mom's apartments for about 200,000$ we ""just"" need a buyer. And we have less than 2 months to make another 300,000$ 🙃

We also have, in a few days, an appointment with lawyers to be sure the bank can ask for that and also because the french government said that banks should allow the people to delay the repaiements of their loans.

So the dream would be that the bank abused of the situation and by cancelling the contract we don't owe money anymore to the bank (but that would be dreaming), another good option would be they allow us to just repay the 3 months we are late on, so it would be just 15,000$ in 2 months, or another good option the banks had to delay the repaiements so they abused of the situation and we can just delay it by 3 months now.

TD;LR : The bank is asking for 500,000$ to payback fully in one time, the loan we made",21Jul2020,3
66,"Obama was in power then.  I was flying from the UK, where I live.  And I arrived in New Mexico.  At the time I didn't know about Breaking Bad - I wasn't on Netflix, and I would have even appreciated it even more if I'd known as I loved that show.

So, it was nice because we stayed at someone's lovely home.  One of them was a native American, and the other was a white American, married.   So we were staying fairly near Santa Fe.

There house was amazing and they had a lot of land with animals such as goats.  She even asked a rodeo from Texas to teach us the lasso - which was fun but very frustrating because I was rubbish at it.  I loved the mexican food and the ridiculously massive portions.  We saw quite a lot of sites, because we were staying with people who live there, so they knew where the best sights were.  I, for the first time in my life, got altitude sickness.  What I loved was the burrito vans selling amazing burritos - which I haven't seen in the UK, as I love avocado, I really enjoyed the food.

We went into Santa Fe for the day.  And I did see a lot of indigenous people there, sat on the pavement (they might have been selling jewellery, I can't quite recall it).  But I did notice one women look at me, and did feel that she looked in a way that she was recognising I was white, I don't want to get into that too much, but there was pain there.  I really sensed that.  And it made feel I needed to be more careful and respectful.

I saw a lot of jewellery with a turquoise stone there, and I wondered why this blue stone is very popular in New Mexico, I tried to ask, but I don't think people quite got what I was asking and I never got the answer.

We stayed there for a few days and then we flew to LA - we stayed in Hollywood for one night, and I took my friend's 3 children to Universal Studios.  It was a good day, but I did feel, in Hollywood and in Universal Studios (not the staff there though or the children), but a lot of women in particular looked me up and down a lot showing a distaste of what I was wearing.  I think it was because my denim skirt was above well above the knee, but it covered me up appropriately.  And I experienced that a lot everywhere I went in LA - I thought it was just an LA thing as I didn't experience that in New Mexico.  I did mention some girls commenting that they liked my handbag, in LA.

There was something else I didn't quite understand in LA.  There was a lot of performers on Sunset Boulevard, which didn't surprise me, what I don't know about , they all had people around them, but they didn't have a negative air about them.  So I don't know if they worked officially and were getting paid, I wonder if they were there to make sure the performers kept with within the law.  I did see a very very poorly women, very near the Marilyn Monroe star.  Things like that don't shock me, I live in a city, I see homeless people, people on drugs.  It wasn't that, she was totally out of it and really needed help.  There was a man there stood by her, but I'm not totally sure why.  Again, he didn't have a negative presence about him, he seemed to be reinging her in a bit - because she starting telling us to F\*\*k off and sprawled on the Marilyn Monroe star whilst we were trying to get a photo.  But it didn't bother me, I just thought she is severely addicted to something and needs desperate help.  So perhaps again, this man, was being there for the tourists perhaps and making sure people don't get to out of line.  (Like anywhere, we have homelessness and drug problems, so not a problem for me).  But we don't have 'minders' if that's what they were.

Then we went to Santa Barbara, I felt more relaxed there - but by that point the 3 kids had got fed up with each other, and it was a constant battle to keep the peace.  We did go to  restaurant, and I was aware I was getting looked up and down then, but I didn't feel as I was getting judged as much as I did when in LA.  A woman on the street the following day, looked at me and gave me a really nice warm smile - but I think it was more to do with a conversation she might have heard with the youngest child - as she was very funny (she made one customs officer laugh).

I did get talking to a few people that lived in Santa Barbara, it was the people on my friend's workshop.  They were commenting how difficult it is to live there given that's its so expensive.

I have to mention this important part, and I forgot about this.  I was in LA first before I went to New Mexico, just to get on my next flight to Albuquerque.  As we were staying at someone's house, I forgot to write there address down and so that caused a problem whilst trying to hop onto the next flight.  The 3 kids were starting to argue by that point, because we had no address.  But we managed to sort it out - I said they 'the children's parents (they were doing some workshops at the time, and it was the Easter holidays, so I came over with their children).  usually stay at Holiday Inn wherever they go, which was the truth, so thankfully, after waiting a long, the guy at the reception desk just googled a holiday inn in Albuquerque and wrote down the address for me - which he might have got sacked for that - but he took pity.

Anyway, I saw the big guns the customs officers had, first time I had ever seen a gun, and I felt fear - and the children focused on that too - and I felt the youngest was too young to see a gun really and that disturbed me but she seemed to be okay with it.

The guns made me feel shaky and nervous around these custom officers.  And I must have appeared really suspicious because I couldn't get my words out when they were asking me questions, and so they asked me a lot of questions.  But finally they let me through.

Anyway, at some point when we arrived at LA - I can't remember if it was before or after the customs officers (perhaps before), I realised I had to have a sticker on each suitcase and it would have come to about $100 - and I was short - because as I was bringing the kids over - their parents gave me a free holiday basically, and provided all the food - so I hadn't yet transferred english money over to american at that point - and I panicked because I didn't have enough.  There was this black women working there, and she just slapped the stickers on our suitcases, I asked her what shall I do about the money, she didn't say much, but she just made it clear that it's okay and just carry on.  So I was very grateful of that for her, and never forget that.

Another thing that struck me - which I saw in Thailand, is a big picture of Obama in the airport - but how would I feel about that if I saw a big picture of Trump - very different.  We don't do that in the UK - perhaps because we've got the royal family maybe. we see the photos of our leader, Boris daily in the newspapers, that's more than enough for me.  When I see the leaders of the country on big frames like that, it feels like a collective respect - which we don't have or ever had in England for our leaders, they get heavily criticised all the time by the citizens, and the newspapers do pick faults with them.  We were very harsh with Theresa May, and she was actually a very nice person - but leadership not so good, I think it broke her down eventually and she was very emotional at the end she stepped down, which was painful to watch.  The respect lies with the royal family I feel - rather than the leader - so that's probably why.

So anyway, I found the people a lot friendlier in Santa Barbara than I did in LA - so I thought maybe LA is a bit like London, where people don't really make friends or smile at each other.  Where I am from 'up north' it's okay to chat to strangers whilst your at the bus stop, or shopping in the supermarket - and the north of England is more like that.  So for me, I'm not really accustomed to not smiling at people when you pass them by.  But I found Santa Barbara, I made some eye contact with people and shared the odd smile.  So I liked it there.  It was weird, because, I didn't realise until I got there how much some of the houses were valued at - and I thought given that people are richer, people were a bit more friendlier - perhaps they were less stressed.  (city life is stressful)

So after we went to San Francisco, and I was waiting in line to go to Alcatraz and the women behind me was pretty brutal about a denim dress I was wearing - it was a dress, cut off at the knees, and in a skater style dress, so it was tighter on my body, and slightly floaty at the bottom , with a belt round it and I was wearing espadrilles, which had a slight cork heal with a bow that went round my ankles.  Fair enough, I had that dress for years, it wasn't brand new, but i didn't feel tarty, I didn't feel overly dressed up or dressed down, out of fashion, sure.  But they just viciously criticised me from head to toe, even commenting on how pale my skin was. And they knew I could hear them.  But I have been exposed to that before in my country - just waiting in a queue at a shop, and girls behind me tearing me down, from head to toe.

So I felt like that again when we went to a Chinese restaurant, fair enough, I didn't know the type of restaurant we went to, but it was an expensive one, I was just wearing a black pencil thin skirt, just below by knees, and a jade coloured plain top with no sleeves and a leather jacket - and I feel each staff member looked me up and down with disapproval.  However, they were wearing the exactly same colour, jade tops as me as their uniform, so they might thought, why would someone, a customer come in and dress the same as us.  So I think it was to do with that - which is a bit strange, but I didn't know where we were going, none of us did, and definitely didn't know what the staff would be wearing.

I did go to one of my friend's workshop's in San Francisco and someone really nice there commented on the way I looked but by that point I was thinking 'are you being sarcastic?' because my confidence was feeling a bit fragile at that point, but I took the compliment and it helped me feel a bit better.

I had this constant awareness that people might be carrying guns, and I felt really aware of not doing stuff wrong, and that was very stressful, because I never felt I could relax there because of that issue.  I have never experienced that before in another country.  And another thing was the flags - I'm seeing a little bit more of that in our country, but thankfully not in my area.  I don't think I live any where near any nationalists - when there are football matches going on, world cup and European, there's lots of flags there.  It's not something we do in England, football yes - but not for nationalism, but it did crop up during the coming out of Europe and when had the Brexit party - but they lost every single seat in parliament  and since then, I haven't seen any flags.

Also, myself and the 3 children, we went into a shop in LA on Sunset Boulevard, and we were confused as to why there was a bunch of key-rings in the shape of a gun with diamante's on, I can't get my head around that.  and I don't think I'll ever understand why would someone want to have a key-ring like that, and couldn't understand why it was sold alongside other souvenirs, not on a top shelf hidden away from children, a toddler would have been able to see that.  Souvenirs that were appealing to children alongside these key-rings shaped like revolvers.  And the fact that there was no warning that there was images of guns when you enter into the shop.  I found that really confusing.  There wasn't anyone saying, that this shop is only suitable for adults.

Although it was an interesting experience and a very stunning, beautiful country, I can't see myself going back there  again, it was a once in a lifetime experience.   (whilst a certain person is in power anyway)

The area that I'm from, and in England it's different where ever you go.  For instance Liverpool, it's a great night out there.  I couldn't  believe how friendly people who live there.  You just walk in to any bar, and straight away, people, male or female, just start talking to you as if you already know them.  And that was walking down the streets, in restaurants, everywhere.  I didn't know that about Liverpool.  My friend came over from Italy, and she was so taken back about how friendly it was as I was (she kept everyone treats you as your best friend).  But it was great.

Where I am from, people are friendly but not to that extent.  In the city centre, people aren't as friendly, but on the outskirts people are.  The city centre is more like London.

Newcastle is another very friendly place - whenever I travel up to Newcastle or going through Newcastle on the train, you can tell when you get nearer, because everyone's talking on the train, and they all talk to each other regardless whether they know you or not.  London is a bit sterile like that - due to it's size I think, and i think a lot of people, that I have met, have struggled to live in London finding it quite a lonely place even though it's crowded.  So I assume, due to the size of LA and San Francisco - that's probably more to do with it.  Whereas Santa Barbara, people seemed to be a bit more relaxed, possibly because they had more time on their hands.

Where I live, being female, no one bothers about what you look like, and I find that in the north of England.  You can get dressed up, dressed down, not make an effort at all, make lots of effort, be very creative - and no one notices.  But it's a diverse city, so that might be why.  However, travelling through London, it's harsh, how you get looked at by other women.  I feel in London, to avoid that - you have to be very on trend with what you're wearing,  It might be because I've had to travel through areas such as Chelsea, but yeah, they don't seem to have much tolerance, if you are wearing something last season.  I don't like London - it's a 'passing through' thing for me.  I'll only go there if I absolutely have to.

So unfriendliness is an area thing I think, because England is very different in each town I feel, and I feel America is no different.  But I'm glad I went to some different places during my short 2 week stay, so I couldn't just say 'all American's are unfriendly'.  I feel, the more slower the pace an area has, the more time people have for each other.  If someone from abroad just stayed in London, they would think everyone in Britain is unfriendly, and they might think that because most tourists probably won't visit the north of England.",21Jul2020,1

Everywhere I go I make a new friend. Everywhere I work I am one of the best at customer service. I just get people's feelings and motivations and with with them like a set of tools. What kind is a person am I?

Among my childhood friends I have none that remain. The original group is still together though and while I get to play Xbox with them when we're free and I enjoy it, they seem to have no issues getting to know and getting close with new people (but not sharing their lives with me and if never want to force them. I ask about their lives from time to time and try to provide encouragement or something but then can kind of give me... avoidant(?) answers. Don't misinterpret this. I know them to be fantastic people. 

In a friend group, which person does that make me?
 

When I try to get close to people I find myself judging them and feeling bored and uninterested. The main type of connection I have between me and someone else has always been sharing sad stories to create a cathartic bond (or so it seems). Therefore, my closest friends have been outcasts, weirdos, or highly paternal (parent-like) people who don't care about being judged. 

Who am I? 


I just want everyone to be happy and get along with each other. In a crowd I'm the one being brave enough to do something eccentric, I'm also the one trying to smooth out disputes, and console someone's hurt feelings. Trying to be everyone's white knight, I suppose.

Who does that make me? Where do I belong in that crowd?

I've been holding onto my end but I no longer share stuff about myself. We talk about a lot of things, and she's the one who tells about herself.
Even when I have to vent I go to the boys. They care, they talk in a therapeutic manner. 
Everytime I drift away, she hmu with ""WHAT IS UP WITH YOU?!"" and overtime I've started caring less about the question.
I'm fine, and I'm not fine. I'm not depressed, but I don't feel that good either. I like being alone, peaceful, not talking to people, other than the boys. Now she keeps asking and somehow seems to want me to tell her what's going on with me, without ever asking herself. Makes me feel like she doesn't care, I give too much than what I get back.
It's not like idc, I just can't rn.

I just need some help here, also ways to say ""I cba to do this"" or ""I don't have the mental capacity to deal with this rn""",21Jul2020,1
73,"I find idolizing famous people (celebrities, influencers, artists etc) extremely unhealthy. Famous people are just people with money and publicity. Stop treating them like saints or perfect people that can do no harm. Famous people can be pedophiles, rapists, racist, fascist, murderers, or just bad people. They slip, they do stupid things, just like everyone does. They may cheat, lie, do drugs, just anyone else might. They are not better, more clever or more educated, just because they appear everywhere. Most of them are not good role models.

Everytime someone famous does something unethical and/or illegal, I keep hearing ""Oh, I didn't expect that from him/her/them"". Why the fuck? You don't know them. We have created, with the help of (social) media the idea of the perfect, super talented people that are great at everything. We follow them on social media, copying them, see what they eat, how they dress, leaving us with a feeling like we have a part in their lives. Let's just admire actors for their acting, singers for their singing etc. Don't be surprised when they do something bad and don't praise them for doing simple shit, like going to the supermarket or taking their kids for a walk.

Admire them for their talent and their talent only. If you wanna praise people doing great things, look around you. There are plenty of ""normal"" people, trying their best, help people and make an actual difference in the world.",21Jul2020,1529

78,"After a session with therapist today, I couldn't stop crying. Seeing my little self being so hurt over something so out of control is devastating. I thought I have got it, I have dealt with my past. But I never got to really grieve my broken 5-years-old self. The world shattered for me that day, it was nothing probably, but for me it was like death. It was me against the world. It ended my safe heaven. And I was never a glowing golden child ever again. I was floating around searching for my missing pieces. For years and years. Carrying these burdens that weren't mine.

So this is to every child and adult out there, if you have once felt helpless and distrust. If you couldn't stand up for yourself. If you ever felt incomplete. If you ever faced the world completely alone. If you carry a mountain of responsibilities and expectations. If you ever felt that you weren't enough.

It was not your fault.

It was never your fault.

\----------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

There are broken people.

Broken adults walking around 

covered in clothes and smiles, and competence.

They were once broken children.

With a broken home.

And a broken world.

Coming with a broken dream.

&amp;#x200B;

They never knew they were damaged.

They thought it was so normal

.. to be abused.

To be left behind.

To be feeling not good enough.

To face a tremendous amount of expectations and responsibilities.

To not living their full potential.

To want to run away 

Far far away...

To stop the pain.

To stop doubting.

To trust.

Oh they don’t know how to trust.

&amp;#x200B;

They don’t know what the ‘right’ look like. 

What it should feel like.

They never saw it, never experience it.

But they know all too well, what ‘wrong’ is

how to push, to drive the other person crazy

They know how to pay attentions to all little details

To overanalysing them

To overthinking them

To make account in their head

To wait for departure

They know how to ruin things..

That was all they know,

How to end

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

They can count on the pain

They choose the wrong people

Who only cause them more pain

But those pain are known and familiar

They have been there before

&amp;#x200B;

Love didn’t exist

Trust didn’t exist

Freedom didn’t exist

There are only sadness

And pain

So sad

So scary

So lost

&amp;#x200B;

I would do anything

I would be anything you want

Just love me, damn it

Just cover me like a blanket of warmth

Just stay, don’t be like them

Just give me the love

All I ever wanted

&amp;#x200B;

Starved. I starved for years and years.

For love and affections

For understanding and trust

I craved those things

And it shows…

&amp;#x200B;

This is what it meant to be broken

You don’t know if you should pick up the pieces

What you suppose to do with them anyway?

Or should you just leave them there

And let it cut you again and again

&amp;#x200B;

Who are you?

What do you do with your self?

What is your voice?

What is your unique, amazing gift to the world

Why are you here?

Do you count?

&amp;#x200B;

When it can be ok to stop hiding?

When will you be enough?",21Jul2020,1

80,"Hi all. I am new to this community, and recently graduated college in May. I have a bachelor's in a business Administration and a minor in Sport and exercise science. I have been searching for a job, and had an interview yesterday with a marketing firm for an entry level marketing assistant job. 

I am on the fence. It's a new company, and they don't offer benefits right now. So no 401k, health/dental/vision insurance, etc. However, it's in a great location, the pay isn't bad..and the people seem pleasant. 

The nature of the work is what is also making me think twice about it. They go into retailers as vendors and marketing energy companies (reliant, etc). I interned with a company where I did almost the exact same thing, so that's not new. 

It's also 6 days a week, which I did not know until this morning. I assumed it was Monday through Friday. The hours aren't long or anything, but I don't know if that kind of work is what I would want to do when I have a degree.

88,"Some days I wish the ground would open up and swallow me. I'm 26 and have done nothing with my life and I'm ashamed and I'm embarrassed. I feel like I've missed my chance at life and there's not a lot I can't actually do about it now... My mental health has gone from bad to worse and I'm pretty sure I'm on the autism spectrum, somewhere...

I will say that for two years I've been working out and watching what I eat. I've stuck with it and seen positive changes physically (I've lost 5 stone). Even during lockdown I've continued and just adapted. So it's not like I don't have any drive or discipline at all... 

I'd love nothing more than to go back to college and throw myself deeply into studying now that I'm sure of what I want to do but I don't have the money to do so because I have very little savings. Because I can't go to college to get the credentials I need, I can't get a foot or even a toe in the door doing what I ultimately want to do in life (wildlife conservation/ecology and I wouldn't mind selling prints of my photography on the side maybe). I don't know people in any of the right places so I can't wing my way through life and succeed that way like many do who are successful. I also seem to have bad luck so I will never be ""in the right place at the right time"" either. I'm willing to work hard and I want a good life and to be successful (success to me doesn't equate to earning a ton of money) in what I want to do so much it breaks my heart to know it may never happen for me regardless of how much or how hard I try. There's multiple road blocks in my way and no way around them, or maybe there is ways around them but I don't have the resources and no one to point me in the right direction, no one to give me a nudge and some much needed encouragement. The cards I've been dealt in life haven't exactly been helpful but I will continue to play them because otherwise I'd be throwing away my chances and I'm not about to just give up like that. I want to make my dad proud of me.

I was born to a wonderful, gentle and intelligent man who worked as a builder, an electrician, and a landscape photographer on the side; all of which he was incredible at. And a heartless, untalented mother who worked as a cashier until she had me at the ripe old age of 42. I saw my dad during the weekends as a child, he'd help me with my homework as much as possible and encourage me when it came to my interests and hobbies (photography, bird watching, entomology). And so would my step mum, who has loved me unconditionally since the day she met me. But all of that encouragement, all of the motivation and determination would be stripped away during the week. As soon as I put my foot through the door on Sunday evening, I would be shouted at and blamed for something despite never doing anything wrong, how could I? I'd have only been in the house 5 minutes... I remember my dad would cry taking me ""home"" in the car. I no doubt believe he would have scooped me up and taken me with him when he left my witch of a mother had he had the space and means to do so, but unfortunately he didn't and so I spent a majority of my childhood sleeping in my room, with my door barricaded to avoid my mother's outbursts. I still to this day watch tv, play video games, or listen to music with my earphones in so I don't accidentally produce noise... Yes, even during the day. 

My mother would also tell me quite often that I will never amount to anything. Berate me if I didn't know something that was beyond my years of understanding, mock me, tell me I'm weird or put me down and then pretend nothing ever happened and try to buy me with gifts. I don't think I've ever heard her tell me she's proud of me. She also told me as a child that she wished she never had me and never actually wanted me. (I honestly wish she had never had me either). I've come to learn that she's a textbook narcissist. But truth be told, she wasn't exactly wrong. In fact, I've done nothing but prove her right. It's as if she spoke my future into existence and there was little I could do to change it... And now that I'm trying to better myself, I'm realising how futile my attempts at turning my life around actually are because the belief that I'm a failure, that I will never be successful or amount to anything are so deeply ingrained in my entire being that I either give up at the first hurdle because I'm not equipped to figure out how to get around it, or self sabotage when things are looking up because I feel I don't deserve it...",21Jul2020,1

104,"Last year work had been slowing down, so I spent a lot of time at work researching algotrading and papertrading. Messing around with options, I thought I found the holy grail to earning cash through arbitrage on butterfly spreads for TSLA. These option prices often become mismatched and it seem like you could by low sell high. I didnt have options level 2 in order to make these trades on my live account. End of January I became unemployed. Since then I've applied for hundreds of jobs. I made some risky option bets when the market was crashing in February and made 25k. I cashed that out and started messing with my retirement. Lost 8k on q2 earnings.

114,"Today I woke at 7:30am to the sound of last nights rain video still playing through my phones speaker. The sound soothed me then as it did the night before, and I fell back into a deep sleep. Rain has that effect on me, makes me feel safe and comfortable. I don't know why.

I woke again around 9am, the video had ended by  this time, but it was raining outside my window for real which has been a rare occurrence in the Scotland this summer oddly. I love the rain, so I counted myself lucky and fell back asleep.  

I woke around 12:30am-ish. This time the rain had left and replacing it was the horrible sticky sunshine. I've no curtain, and my bed positions me like an ant below a magnifying glass next to my window, so I did what any socially awkward 21 year old would do. Sat up slightly in my bed, so that my back was propped against the wall and I was slightly out of the sun then proceeded to browse Reddit till around 3pm.

I fell back asleep as soon as the sun repositioned itself ever so slightly and didn't rewaken till 6pm. That's when it all sank in. I hadn't had human contact today. My days were becoming so meaningless that I could sleep them away. I checked my phone, not a single text. I've let myself become too comfortable being alone. And by now I felt even worse for feeling sorry for myself. I felt pathetic. That's part of the problem I guess... I feel pathetic discussing this issue with anyone in person.

I don't think I moved till around 11:30pm. I can't even remember if I dosed off again or not. At around 11:30pm I decided to go get myself some food. I hadn't eaten today and my legs were growing weak just laying there motionless. After I came back from the kitchen I continued to do nothing. Literally no action, movements, nothing. I haven't heard myself speak more than 3 or 4 times today. It makes you start to question your own reality when no one sees you.

I don't know what I'm asking for to be honest. I need to feel like my day was more than what just transpired. I think letting someone, even someone anonymous know whats going through my head, helps me feel like at least I can acknowledge that my current situation isn't good.

Me M23 Her F20

* Met in August 2019
* Some shit happened mid-august to end October and my mental health deteriorated even more
* Were ""exclusive"" in November
* Official in December 
* Have been happy ever since

Time goes by really quickly, it feels like just yesterday when I made a post on Reddit about the first time she said I love you. To this day I get the same feeling every time I look at her. Now having anxiety that in my case was a strange type plus being in a relationship definitely put my mental health to work. Every day at the start was like a workout, needed to know this, needed to know that, didn't like this, didn't like that etc etc etc It got exhausting and I started to hate myself for putting this poor girl in such strange scenarios. It got to a point where I was questioning why she was still with me. Simply put she loves me and wanted to help me no matter how unreasonable I was, she understood that I had a mental disability and wasn't doing anything on purpose. So slowly slowly with her help, my mental health has improved to the point I wouldn't recognize myself when we first started dating. Im so happy and lucky that my first girlfriend (technically ish)  was her, I dought that any other girl would of put up with me for this long... And i love her endlessly for this, having the feeling that someone truly loves you and you know it for sure, is an amazing feeling.

Now, lockdown... something no one could have predicted. In my case, i hated it because i wanted to see her every day like we were doing before. My anxiety was really bad during these times and was difficult to deal with. I needed her. She was my anchor. I didn't understand ""me time"". She wanted it every now and then but i understood it as a break, well my anxiety did. Since i always wanted to see her or be around her, i didn't really need or want ""me time"" so i found it very difficult to understand this concept of me-time. Now I'm at a point where we can just skype or talk every day without any problems, i dont think  ""when will i see her next, it has to be on this day at this time"". I take each day by day and whenever it happens it happens, you will see her again, relax. 

At mid relationship (4months in) the honeymoon faze started to fade, but i didn't know what this meant. I went through a stage (more like a day or two) where I couldn't understand why i didn't have that First time seeing her feeling. And this is when my GAD was on fire. 

* How is this possible? 
* How do i not like her? 
* wait do i not like her? 
* do i still like her? 
* I definitely still like her right?
* Why do i want alone time now?

If u have GAD and start feeling like this just chill bro its the honeymoon phase ending and you start to realize that you in a relationship and you just a relationship now, not a new one. You just start being seen as the two who are dating, all your friends and family are caught up and have acknowledged you both are in a relationship. 

Few other things I have learnt is that sometimes  (most times, lets not get ahead of ourselves) your anxiety is just being stupid. My best advice is to speak to more than one person. Bring your mom into it, your dad, your brothers/sisters, friends whoever. The more you speak to people the more you understand that whatever is happening is normal. If u keep it with yourself you are having a conversation and are trying to prove to yourself that your anxiety is right. Sure if everyone is saying that you have a good point then speak to your girlfriend about it and see what happens. Which brings me to my next point. If you have something to say, say it. Speak to her. The moment something bugs you, tell her and to expect her to do the same. You will save yourself a lot of arguments in future. There is nothing worst than you believing that everything is going well and one random day you do something that you have been doing for the past 2 months just fine was actually a massive pet peeve of hers.... 

The last bit of advice, and this one is going to hurt. If its not meant to be its not meant to be. If her path is to break up and go her own way, you cannot try to delay her path. What I'm saying is if she is going out alone with her friends and other guys or whatever you should not be anxious and think she is going to cheat, or flirt with someone else. If her end goal was never with you there is no point in telling her ""no you cant see this guy, no you cant go out tonight if I'm not coming"" its just delaying something that was going to happen one way or another. Both of you need to just believe in yourself that you are trustworthy. No one should be proving themselves to one and other.  Im not saying that you should just be free willy and always be naive, you should always have a line that both of you understand and agree one. 

That was my two sense. If you liked that I'm glad, if not and think i can improve on something please tell me!",21Jul2020,1
118,"I've recent experienced a lot of moments where I've felt really down with myself and with what I do.

Purposely ""lying"" to the negative part of me to convince a change to a positive, by saying things like: 

- ""I love my job"" although I could do better and something more of my thing
- ""My day has been fantastic"" even though I had down moments I just focus on the ups.

Or things like that, instead of seeing the negative part of life, I want to see the positive without neglectic the negatives.

After all a balanced life is filled with both, so Im trying to reach a place where I am happy regardless of how bad things look.

Any tips are welcome :)

Side note: I still have moments where I feel really down, but I just take a step back and breathe or go for a walk, it's not all happy walks in the meadows.",21Jul2020,1
119,"This is a long story about my shitty life and I would really appreciate if you read it till the end.


THE SINGAPORE:
After 8 years of wait and a serious warning of divorce, my mom finally convinced my dad to take her, me and my elder sister with him to settle down in Singapore. First time in a new country, we are visiting all the famous destinations till reality hits again. 3 weeks gone and there is drama, violence, swearing, ignorance between the 2 adults of the house. There were 4 months before we could go to school. I was in 4th grade, couldn't make any friends in the building. So, months passed by and we went to school for a month before the fights crossed the limit. My dad now wanted to send us back to India due to an excuse that he couldn't afford the family expenses. Then one morning a call comes saying that my dad's mom (grandma) is hospitalized and is in a serious condition. There starts the packing and everyone heads back to India. Grandma dies and dad goes back abroad, this time Malaysia. Grandpa were alone came to live with us, I had to repeat my 4th grade again,as the year got wasted.

THE MALAYSIA:
It's been 3 years now, grandpa passed away too and sister has finished her school. Mom has now become a true believer of God and black magic. Topic of the fights is now to take my sister to Malaysia for further studies.
Sis goes abroad and I cannot have friends anymore coz if I go play with my friends, they will touch me or whisper something in the ear so that me and my mom will never be able to go abroad, that is what my mom said and I was literally trapped in my home for a year without phone or internet or laptop, school was there though. After that we too shifted to Malaysia. Remember- the fights never stop, since sis has grown, she has joined my mother's side adding even more fuel to the fire.
An unstable family of 4 living in Malaysia. There is pure hate in the eyes of three. One historic day, my mom out of her mind snatches dad's laptop which he used to avoid and ignore us and smashes it bang to the floor. There was nothing that my dad loved more then his laptop and the data in it. He was a visa consultant, person who gets you a visa for study or work purposes. Funny isn't it??
A few weeks later, it is 11pm and dad hasn't returned Frome the grocery store which we owned as a side business. It's 1am now, phone is switched off three of us are worrying and a message comes.
Turns out my dad ran away to Phillipines and stole all my mom's saving and all those fights... Those were being recorded (audio) by him. The parts where my mom is swearing and hitting him were sent to all our relatives who are of really really conservative mind. Swearing on your husband is like a sin. My mom became an outcast. Blackmail was that if we go back to India forever, he would give us the money back. But we stayed... with the little 5000 ringgit, we stayed for another year. This was 2018, rent, school fees, van fees, electricity bill, water bill none of it was paid and our visas were expired before he left us.(he said he has given the visa renewal task to an agent, it was a lie) he never contacted again, flat owner cut the electricity and water supply. I was 15, managed to steal the switch that the owner took away and replaced the water meter that he also took away with a water pipe that I made with proper fitting and valves....will continue in a second post please keep reading there is more to it.",21Jul2020,1
121,"How many of us here believe in love? How many of us actually practice loving others? 

I know that I've failed to do so, many many times.

Now, I don't mean love as a fuzzy feeling you have for someone else. Or even an emotion, period. I mean love as in the action. The action of willing the best for others.

If I disagree with you, I still love you. If I am hurt by you, I still love you. If you disagree with me, I hope it's not taken as an attack. And if I hurt you, I apologize for it and I hope we can talk it out - maybe there's miscommunication on one of our ends, or maybe I simply failed in that moment to love you.

No matter what, I strive to love everyone equally. I strive to not only want the best for you, but to work for it by helping you get to be your best and most loving, most loved self.

I guarantee that once you let this idea sink in, and start to practice love in this way, your life will have some serious turnarounds.

128,"So I'll briefly explain, I was fortunate to attend an amazing retreat with a Zen Buddhist Master, Thich Nhat Hanh and his fellow monks and nuns a while ago now.  He was a peace activist in the Vietnam War, which I'm sure many US citizens know about.

There is a story which Thich Nhah Hanh experienced that I will never forget.

At some point during the conflicts in Vietnam, an Vietnamese soldier held him at gunpoint - with the gun pointing to his head ready to kill him.  Thich Nhah Hanh, due to his practice of nonviolence, continued to mediate and had the ability to have an intense amount of compassion and empathy, and forgiveness for this man who was about to shoot.  As that is Thich Nhah Hanh's core practice of his brand of Applied Buddhism.

The vietnamese soldier could not bring himself to shoot him.  Thich Nhah Hanh believes this was due to the level of 'warmth' the soldier experienced from Thich Nhah Hanh, without words, just being in his presence (and I can well imagine that, because that is how I felt when I experienced his teachings, so I feel very fortunate that I had a chance to do that in my lifetime).

I don't know what happened after that.  Thich Nhah Hanh is clever with his wisdom, and only sticks to the parts of the story to benefit us.

So that's all I have to say here.",21Jul2020,1

I miss my long lost friend named Barry Allen, and I'm actually very worried about him.. he is from Central City and works with the ccpd, his full name is Bartholomew. A long time ago i got kicked out of all of my bipolar and schizo support groups and my parents were threatening to send me away so I had to make more friends and try to improve my life... and that's where I met Barry Allen. We talked on Facebook and texted for a long time, sometimes he could visit memostly at night when he got off of work..
. and a lot of times he would have to go away for work since he was a forensic scientist with Central City... then he revealed to me that he was involved with Star Labs which was responsible for the explosion and everything and I'm pretty sure he got put away or something like that... Really I think he's lost or in danger but I can't really open up to that in public only with people that I trust. I found out that his Facebook got deleted or he might have deleted it and that is lost or hiding from something, which I also can't really tell the public about it would have to be somebody I trusted personally and maybe someone will working with Star Labs would be able to help me. I can't contact his friend Cisco Ramon either who was an engineer at Star Labs. I've never met a better friend and I am so worried about him and I miss him so much and I don't know what to do.

136,I dont want to speak to my cousin. I dont call him i dont text him nothing. When we were younger he used to bully me because I wouldn’t fight back. So he saw this as weakness and just continued it. I never did anything until later in life but ill come back to that. I remember one day specifically my sister myself and his two brothers were playing basketball at the courts it was just us there. We finished a game and i was tired so i went and sat down on the side. They tried to get me to play another game i didnt want too. So cousin in question takes the basketball at point blank range and throws it in my face and calls me a bitch . Literally my face nose n all . I was so upset still am to this day im mad rn writing this. But once again I didn’t fight back just let it happen and acted like it never happened. I have many many more situations and stories like this. I refuse to forget what he did. I slightly forgive him but i dont feel like he regrets it all. He wants a relationship with me get mad at me because i dont call him or text him? Aita for not wanting to be tight with this guy?

141," Suffering comes in so many ways, it won't just happen from our own thoughts and problems, sometimes others play a big role in agonizing us and instigating that pain which no one likes. We all live in society surrounded by hundreds of people at any given time. Plenty of them we know and many we don't.   
As human beings we love control, we love certainty and predicted outcomes, we all have tendencies to do things which have low to zero risk. But reality is we can't control 99% of things happening and future is uncertain and unpredictable. But as mentioned what is our first instinct we want to control everything, either the people or the event itself. We want things the way we want and when they don't, we feel offended, angry and disappointed. Which then becomes the reason for our suffering, so the main culprit is our love for control and certainty.   
Why this happens? Is it because things doesn't go the way we want or just because we are too afraid to let go. Let go of the desire for specific outcomes and our ego or let go of the expectations from the other persons.  Because we just simply wants to controls everything, others and our surroundings.  
 Until and unless we make letting go as the integral part of our living, our issues, worries and problems they will keep on surrounded us and make our life full of sufferings, pain and hurt.  
 How to get Instant freedom from our sufferings which are surrounding us.  
1. Behavioral Acceptance towards the attachments and how we make them: We need to reflect and evaluate on our behavior and accept first of all that we make these attachments and wants to control each and everything coming our way. Until we learn why and how we make attachments it very hard to change them. Once we get this, next step will be much easier.   
   
2. Let go: Just drop the thoughts, perceptions, judgments we are making for any given particular scenario. We cannot control 99% of things happening around us, we cannot control the behavior of our loved ones, our family, our kids or the outcome of hard work we putting toward something. No one can predict things or be absolute certain about anything. The only one thing which we can control is us and our behaviour. We need to drop the thought, idea, belief arising in our mind, just be flexible and open towards anything and everything presented to us.   
Instead of reacting towards things which goes against us, just observe it and then drop the arising thought, emotion and feeling right there and move forward with no baggage of any kind in our heart. In the beginning this will seem hard, but with time and practice we can really make it work and the stress of emotions much less. How to drop thoughts, [click here](https://www.calmmindpower.com//post/why-ignore-your-thoughts-and-feelings).   
3.Understanding towards How life works: A day will come when everything will finish and we will leave this body and earth. There was a day when we were 1 year old and there will be a day when we will be 80 years old and one day we die. The only thing which is true, is we are changing every moment and nothing stays permanent. The only thing permanent is the unconditional, the vacant space around us, as that will always be vacant. Everything else conditional will depreciate and deteriorate, but not this space. Close your eyes and try to see inside you and you will only and only see this huge vacant space or vacuum inside you. That's where, in that quiet and emptiness, the ultimate peace is, so if you want peace, stop overthinking, stop those attachments to things, beliefs and ideas, just see things as they come and be open minded and flexible to them. Don't get easily moved by things, as there only nature is just passing away. No point having this love for excessive control.    
4. Prioritizing what is more important for you: Is it suffering or peace? If you want peace, you will find a solution, else suffering is just everywhere. Our tendency is, we get attracted to suffering easier than peace. We make attachments more easier than letting go. We prefer and find comfort in attachments rather than being free from them.  If things are not bothering us, we feel something is wrong.  
Now this is a conscious choice we have to make, is it time to be free or you still like to keep on rolling in this wheel of hurt and suffering. Prioritize your decision and the way you want to live this life. Choose between freedom or bondage, control and let go. 

  
5: Meditation and knowing yourself: One can only grow when you know oneself well and aware of everything you are doing or going through. Because  awareness is the only thing which will open all these doors, which are closed by our greediness, anger and desires. There is no other way than meditation for knowing yourself and how your mind works. Sit down close your eyes, slow down things and see how your mind works and runs towards things, towards the control it wants to gain and keeps you always busy with thoughts, worries, emotions, feelings, making several attachments towards worldly affairs and keeping us away from the freedom we want. Freedom from worries, stresses and traps of sufferings. Learn how our mind wants us to suffer, by running towards one kind of attributes and running away from other.  
Instant freedom is just there, a simple choice which we needs to make between holding on to something or just drop it or let go of it. Learn about yourself and what is the actual reality of things. What kind of gains are coming from this control, if nothing is coming then maybe start this journey of  peace and calm.

142,"Fatherless men may fall into passivity in their relationship, refusing to offer their strength and leadership where their women need it most.  A man’s core role is to provide, protect, lead and cover his family.  But when he has not had a father to teach and set a tangible example for him, his entire family may suffer.


Children suffer the greatest when a father is absent.
63% of youth suicides are from fatherless homes.
90% of all homeless and runaway children are from fatherless homes.
85% of all children that exhibit behavioral disorders come from fatherless homes.
80% of rapists with displaced anger come from fatherless homes.
71% of all high school dropouts come from fatherless homes.
85% of all youths sitting in prisons grew up in a fatherless home.

While many single mothers have done a tremendous job of bringing up boys, a woman cannot give a boy something she has never possessed; authentic masculinity.


 “Fatherless boys spend up to 80% of their time with women. They don’t know how to act when they grow up. This directly affects the relationships between the sexes. Men become more helpless, like big kids.” – Sociologist Peter Karl


It takes a man, to make a man.
“Every time you raise a loving, wise, and responsible man, you have created a better world for women. Women today are having to bond with half-men, boys not fully raised into manhood, they don’t know what their responsibilities are, and don’t have a strong sense of service. Today’s father’s have an opportunity to change that.” –  Dr. Michael Gurian


Difficulties Bonding
Men who grow up without a father figure also have more problems bonding with their own children, writes Hartwell-Walker. Having never experienced a father-son bond, they are unsure of how to develop that relationship with their own children. Men who had absent fathers are more likely to be absent fathers themselves. These men were also never taught how to have healthy relationships with women and tend to have higher break-up and divorce rates than men who grow up with a father’s influence.
Emotional Distress
Boys who grow up without a father show higher stress levels to daily challenges -- traffic or dealing with a boss, for example -- writes Kathleen Doheny in her PsychCentral.com article, “Good Dad, Good Coping Skills Later",21Jul2020,1
