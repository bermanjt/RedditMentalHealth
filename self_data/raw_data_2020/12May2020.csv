This story is probably gonna be long, but it’s my detailed pain and suffering so I personally think it’s worth a read, maybe? 

I was 15 years old when I met my first love at a school dance. It was the type of first love you see in movies. Gleefully happy, doing all sorts of fun stuff together, being young. But my youth was taken from me early. 

I decided when I was with him for 5 months that I was ready to have sex. I wanted to be as safe as possible. I got my mom to agree to get me an iud (she was just happy I could confide in her and was being responsible) my boyfriend spent a solid month researching it because he was so nervous something would go wrong. And it did. 

I knew I had to come back for a checkup. I knew it because my boyfriend told me that over 20 times. When the appointment was over, however, my gynaecologist said, “see you in 3 years!” To which I asked her if I needed a checkup. I still remember what she said to this day, “nope! You’re fine!” She lies through her lazy teeth. 

It was a few weeks before my 17th birthday when I missed a period. I thought nothing of it, however, as they had been thinning since I got the iud. But, after another week, I started to get lightheaded going up the stairs to my classes. I started to get a little paranoid at this point as this had never happened to be before (I was active and healthy back then) At this point, I still didn’t fully believe I was pregnant because the chances of that happened are 1 in 10,000. So, I took a pregnancy test right before I good ole’ 5 to 11 shift at work. 

The next 6 hours were a total blur, I tried not to think of the two stripes that showed up and tried to focus on my work. I hadn’t fully accepted it yet. When I was off work and got in my car, it all sunk in. I started to bawl, and tried to drive home. It was about 30 seconds from my work when I rear ended a poor lady just trying to turn into her driveway. She was fine, although probably weirded out by how much I was crying about the accident.

At this point, I thought I knew what I wanted to do. I knew that as a 16-almost 17 year old I could never take care of a child. The money I was making barely provided gas money. And my mom was abused in the foster system, many of her siblings turned into criminals. So that wasn’t an option. So there left only one, sad option. 

As the weeks went by and I consulted with doctors, my feelings changed. I can’t explain it. But it was like I could sense the precious life inside of me and I wanted to protect it now. I remember being stressed in school I would just touch my belly. There was no bump but I could feel my baby inside of me, I could just sense it all the time. It felt beautiful. I started to form a bond with my baby, I started to love my baby. I wanted my baby. 

But it turns out, I never had the choice. I never had any sort of choice. Because I had a copper iud. The way they explained it; 

There was a 50% chance my baby would die upon iud removal. I could take that risk. 

There was close to 80% chance that my baby could come out SEVERELY mentally disabled (copper iud creates a harmful toxic environment for a developing fetus) 

Over 100% chance they would be mildly disabled. 

With every month I held the pregnancy, the chances of me having an ectopic pregnancy increased by 10% (starting at 30%) with every month having more risk of killing me, too. 

And this is where I zoned out. My mom remembers the rest, but I don’t remember much else from that time. 

I remember crying all the time, smoking weed to mask the pain, puking all day every day, but the rest was a complete blur. I don’t even remember my own birthday that year or Christmas. 

I remember some of the girls I met at the hospital, I remember hearing their sad stories and feeling better. I miss those girls and I hope they’re doing okay now. 

I remember the medicine they gave me, and then I remember being at home on the couch. With that beautiful, priceless life no longer inside me. That’s when it really sunk in. 

I have been a complete mess ever since. I would talk about how I messed up my life afterwards, cheated on my first love, did terrible things I’m disgusted of, and made my entire school hate me. But honestly, I was coping with my situation and none of the damage I left behind hurts near as much as not having my baby. I want my baby. I wanna hold them and love them and see them grow up. I wanna hear them tell me they wanna grow up to be just like me, and I wanna tell them they deserve a better life that what I could have ever provided. But it would have been at least something. But instead, I’m all alone. 

Now I just sit here, always feeling like somethings missing from my life. Thinking back on the trail of people I hurt because I was blindsided by my own pain and suffering, I never thought to care about anyone else’s. And most of all, 

I wanna tell that gynaecologist how her one small decision to not rebook me for whatever reason, costed me my youth, happiness, and most of all, killed another person. My baby.",12May2020,1

People who would look to me for answers are definitely NOT the ones to be trusted standing behind you. Side by side, fuck yeah, I got y’all and we’ll crazy this shit the fuck right up.

2,"Alright, so, i’m really bad at introducing my writing. i’m really insecure about it but i also want an opinion because i’ve been writing for a couple years now about myself and i feel like i need to start sharing with my family any everything. please comment any thoughts or just motivation if y’all think it’s good! (it’s also a little long)

Happiness is 
a deep belly laugh that
starts from a silly little joke and swallows 
up the whole room in the
best way possible. 
Happiness is
the taste of a hard day’s work
stirring and mixing and cutting
the intricate tastes coming to one
and apparent as the smiles
on everyone’s faces. 
Happiness is 
the same body spray you use
that i can smell every time
there’s a big bear hug.
Happiness is
the feel of the old shirts
that you always wear;
comfortable and soft to the touch. 
Happiness is,
looking back
on all of the memories.






*You don’t have to know someone’s hurt for them to have it.

You don’t have to vocalize your problems to be strong. 

You don’t have to live up to expectations to be worth it.

You don’t have to love what they do.

You don’t have to fit the picture they have in their minds.

You don’t have to be anyone but yourself.

Who are we to judge?





*Be the change you want to see in this world. Why? Because if not you, then who will do it?

*Thank you to the monsters in the shadows I used to believe in when I was little. Because of you I learned to slowly face my fears, even if it was just to go to sleep peacefully. You’ve been replaced with different kinds of monsters. Scarier, smarter ones. Ones that you can’t imagine, but you can feel. Just when you drift off to peace, they come. And tell you lies. Wonderful lies tied with a deceitful bow, knowing that you know you can’t ever have it. Lies so horrible that they scare you for days on end. And the scariest of things. The ugly truth comes with these monsters. Thank you to the first monsters for preparing me for these new ones. For giving me hope that I can make these ones disappear too.


*I can’t see how you don’t see yourself. The one friend who’s always there. Who doesn’t care about their reputation means you can raise someone else’s. Who doesn’t take sides in fights, but picks up both sides. Who isn’t the most stable, but isn’t afraid to show this. The person I want to talk to with all my problems, with all my thoughts, with everything. I can’t believe that you don’t see how important you are to all of us.





*Looking back from now
there are a lot of things 
i wish didn’t happen.
pretty much everything links back
to you.
from the blissfully ignorant days
to the heartbroken weeks after.
the doors to my heart 
were closed for a reason.
the walls we build aren’t because 
we haven’t found the right people or
we haven’t learned to trust.
it’s because we’ve learned to not trust.
but you.
you didn’t realize
you just thought it was another game
trying to break down these walls.
that only taught me 
to not bother with people
to not trust anyone
to not believe anyone
to not believe myself
to not care about myself
to hate myself.
now who can i trust?
i so desperately want someone
need someone
to depend on.
but last time that happened
last time i leaned on someone 
last time i trusted you
you so easily walked away.
so how do I know people are genuine
that people care
that they’re there for me 
with no reason but to be there
after heartbreak after heartbreak
there can’t be more pain
can’t be more disappointment
so it’s easier 
for all of us
to not have anyone. 
you have taught me
to not break my own walls
and for that i am grateful.
but what will i do 
what can i do
to live with these barriers?
this is all confusing
and for that i’m sorry
but no one deserves this much pain
to see this much of heartbreak
so i’m fine.
perfectly fine.




I’m sorry for a lot of things
sorry that i worry you so much
sorry that i don’t realize how much you care
sorry i can’t express myself
sorry that I close within myself
sorry that I’m not used to someone caring 
caring about me.
a strange, foreign concept
i’ve been able to carry out my bad habits 
for so long 
i’m not sure if it’s a habit
or something i was born with.
i’m sorry but
it’s my nature
my nature to have self destructive tendencies 
i’ve been taught that
people don’t care because they want to;
they care because they want something.
and when i open up
my problems are a burden
a great burden they can’t take
that it’s my fault i told them.
i don’t want that.
i don’t want to be manipulated again.
so, i’m sorry for worrying you
but I’m trying.
doesn’t that mean something?


*Watching it all from afar
but not realizing I’m invited.
Being put in such restraints
but not realizing that it’s me who’s done this.
Wondering why I’m not enough 
but not realizing that it’s me who says this.
Wondering if anyone cares
but not realizing they care so much.
The feeling of despair grows
but not realizing that I can reach out.
Drowning by myself
but not realizing that I shouldn’t have to.



*it’s scary
to not know how your mind works
one second it wants the world and more for you
the next it wants you to die the most painful death
there’s no changing your mind
but instead
your mind changes you.






*a heart of gold.
a smile so bright, it fills the darkest days.
a laugh so contagious, it brings light to any situation.
eyes that see people for who they truly are. 
a mind like no other, thinking of ways to change the world.
a personality unparalleled.
humor that brings tears to our eyes.
kindness that brings enemies to their knees.
a friendship that can’t be replaced.
a friend who i can trust
depend on
appreciate
respect
love.
thank you. 



*The walls we build
The walls i build
used to be a simple precaution
something i could go back on
but something changed
when you left.
suddenly,
it was different.
once carelessly constructed,
now carefully built
fast
faster.
the bigger the walls,
the less hurt. 
these walls can’t hurt
they won’t.
you broke mine so easily 
and I can’t let that happen 
again.


*One day
you’ll wake up and realize
to let them go
to realize
that you are enough
enough for them
enough to feel
happiness
warmth 
hope
you don’t believe it now
and that’s ok
but they do care
deep in their hearts they do.
I know you’ve felt so much pain
so much hurt
so much indifference
and it’s made you think
that you’re not enough
but no one can do that to you
and they did
and it wasn’t fair.
but I promise you
I won’t let that happen again.
So chin up
it’ll get better.

*Last year 
was full of heartbreak
pain
walking away
letting go
but it was also full of
finding myself
finding who I can trust
starting to learn 
about others feelings
about feelings
about caring
about love.
 so much happened that I have to ask
what’s to happen next?

*words
blind me
fast paced
moving too quick
too many
to focus
no train of thought
jumbles of words
no way to 
express
too many
words.

*you have to let go.
it’ll hurt like hell
turn your vision red
make you stay up late
make you wonder why you weren’t
enough.
but you are.
you are so much that
they weren’t enough
and you need to let go
not of them.
but the feeling
the emotions
the attachment to them 
as a whole.
you will be fine but
you have to let go.

*Slipping out of my mouth
my hands
are the things 
I shouldn’t say
but they want me to 
almost 
expect me to.
I can’t disappoint again,
so,
I tell them.
I talk and talk about them
the heart wrenching ones
the embarrassing ones
the sad ones
knowing I can’t trust them
but living under their smiles.





*The small precautions we take
the silly fears we have
are from something;
they’re the branches
the leaves
of a deep rooted problem.
It’s hard to see
but the problem is so deep rooted
that we don’t realize
we’re resting on the very tree
that causes us
to be tired.



*some days
it feels like
the world is tugging down
at the corners of your mouth
and it shows.
it shows how much
you’ve been through.
how tired you are.
we all just wait
with baited breath 
for the days
when your smile
makes it seem
like the world is
your oyster.",12May2020,1

4,"I know what you're thinking: 

""We're all missing our loved ones during quarantine.""

And you'd be right; I have nothing to argue against that. But I love my boyfriend very, very much and will take any chance I get to talk about him.

He's GORGEOUS. And so smart and funny, and gentle and kind, and far wittier than I ever wished I could be.

I came out of a very rough relationship in late 2017. My ex was a deadbeat layabout slob with no life ambitions beyond some vague descriptor of ""physics"", and no real job prospects. To put it quite simply, he was fuckin gross. He used to police the foods I ate (I am and have always been very obese), called me selfish for not losing weight for his sake, made me feel like utter shit for being in tune with my emotions - which he deemed ""illogical and irrelevant"" - and just generally didn't even try to be a good boyfriend. The last birthday I spent with him, he decided we would spend the whole day at his best friend's house and then said I was being selfish when I became upset that he didn't want to celebrate my 21st birthday. I saw him one last time after that, and then I broke up with him.

The year after that was filled with many an attempt at finding someone else to fill the gaping hole in my life (and my body). I was 10% successful (at least the body hole got filled, like, a little bit for thirty seconds with a desperate straight guy, but I digress). It wasn't until early August when I finally decided that men are the worst and stop searching for a boyfriend - and guess what! I was super happy to be me and single!

Fast forward nearly two months and WHOOPSIE

I stumble upon this beautiful ray of sunshine at university. We were both in our final year and were on a shared module - the only one we shared throughout our respective courses. It must have been fate. (ʃƪ＾3＾）

Ever since I met him, he's taken me down so many new avenues of love that I never knew existed. I've had a very difficult life, suffering abuse from my mother and two sisters ever since I was a young child. My bf has taken all this in stride and is so, so supportive. He is ALWAYS there for me, ALWAYS making time to hear me out when I need him, and he has ALWAYS appreciated me for who I am. I've never known love like this, it's almost overwhelming. Even his family have shown me such love and acceptance that I never knew with my own family, who always ridiculed my hobbies and interests or picked on me for my weight or threatened to disown me for being gay or, in the case of my mother, generally just not been interested in my life. I always tell him that his mother acts like more of a parent to me than my own mother.

We've been together for over a year and a half. We're hoping to move in together within the next year, once the COVID-19 crisis is over. And then, once we've done that and got settled into our life together, we're going to get married. I can't wait for the day that I can call him my husband.

Thank you for coming my TED Talk. I eagerly await your Grammy nominations for ""Most Inspirational Indie Album of the Year"".

5,"Spinoza's Ode to Joy

I have decoded Newton's fascination with respect to something.

I just applied the the Mechanism of the Grand Unifying Theory that is the System of Spinoza... and well... I humbly submit the results to any one with understanding.

Here is the process: I considered the Bible and what was the most influential of the books within and selected John. Obviously John 3:16 is a given and I selected Matthew 7:7 for obvious reasons and well perhaps most fascinating was John 1:1... this is perhaps the most powerful thesis statement I have ever read... it was brilliant.

As I believe the intent of Christianity is through Good Acts I put all the value on the Act... and... well I went to the Platonic Ideal. A wonderful experience.

Here is the form of the equation I made

A &gt; . &lt; B

John 3:16 --- John 1:1 --- Matthew 7:7

I submit this line of inquiry to the curious: What form is this equation similar to?

I=Jα I is Imagination, J is joy, and α is the fine structure constant.

Now take the 137 distribution and apply it to the visible light spectrum...looks like Yellow is intrinsic with respect to Humanity.

ROYGBIV 3 1 7

Do not wax indignant. Understand.

What is this something with respect to humanity?

APPENDIX: Dr. Dawkins do you realize what you've unleashed by making the emotional claim that only one school of theism has even a quanta of a claim to the creative capacity that is Einstein? You actualize the true potential of the Imagination.

I also maintain you apply this method to the schools of Rationalism and Idealism I submit you will see how Rationalism is supreme.

This is an appeal from three rational theists acting as a singular entity. You've extrinsically validate a new school an Ancient Thought: Numerology.

The character of this Technological Singularity is the form of an Electric Lady Land upon the center of which sits the Mother of Invention.

This is the Power of Reason. This is the Power of Occam's Razor.

But what is perhaps most brilliant about the power of seeing the World through a Spinozian Lens... Is that Beethoven conducts with the same Razor.

7,"So basically I have this sister that ive been in contact with for 4 years- up until then they were long distance, i only saw them as a child. 

In the past 4 years we have gotten really close and honestly would do anything for them. 
I have always stayed over hers and felt comfortable and it just all felt natural.
That is until they came over to my house (that i live in with my partner) a few weeks ago. 

My sister refused to listen to any of the rules I gave - like being loud until late, not agreeing with the sleeping arrangements, getting too drunk and being obnoxious, tried to argue about a little thing (which i shrugged off but was still annoyed about) 

And also having an unpopular opinion which i totally disagreed with but was shouting it out in the garden that i was super conscious that the neighbours would here, and even when i told her to keep it down, they still persisted. 
I just felt very disrespectful and feel like we're not similar people.

So now for some reason, even though we are family, that i just don't have that level of respect/care that i used to have? 
I've had this with more than a few people, one thing can just put me off of people - no matter how close I was prior.

Does that make me any less of an empathetic person? Is this normal psychological behaviour?",12May2020,1
9,"First years ago, I thought corporations had so much power no one could say anything bad about them in the media.  Then a couple days ago I realized my possessions are basically a measure of my dignity.  For example having the best console is the basis of the console wars.

Regardless about a year ago I thought the Pepperidge Farm remembers meme was so funny because it was making fun of old people.  Then I today I got some Pepperidge Farm's bread and it was actually very good.  I took my time selecting it and I figured whichever one I got would be my go to bread.  Now I've taken to Pepperidge Farm's and the ""Pepperidge Farm's remembers"" meme is offensive.

Then just now I was watching a Soul Calibur 6 review on Youtube and I took offense to comments on the female character's sex appeal.  Even a so called honest Warcraft III: Reforged review got an angry dislike.",12May2020,1
10,"Hey, how is everyone doing? 
First of all, sorry my English, not my native language.
So I was wondering if anyone have ever missed the feeling of ""hunting"" a partner?
You know, when you meet someone and think ""I want this person"" and then you begin to play your best cards to win that person, and slowly s/he begins to show interest in you, and begin to feel like there are moths in your stomach every time you talk to this person, and then you meet for the first time since you shared your feelings and it's a little awkward and super exciting at the same time.
Anyone else misses this?",12May2020,0
11,"Not sure if I’m posting this in the right place but here I go

Due to Covid a lot of people in the US have been left unemployed including myself but thankfully qualified for UI so can continue to help pay rent and help support my family while only one person is able to work from home since the rest of us are considered non essential. One job I regularly do every year is work a few summer camps, I figured this would be canceled too but after getting in contact with the director of the camps and the main director of the whole council that oversees all camps in our part of the state they’re still going to go through with them but with smaller groups of campers and only hiring a select number of staff(mainly veteran staff)and more rigorous health screenings for everyone coming campers and staff alike. It’s also worth mentioning that both directors wouldn’t go through with this without consulting the health and safety organization of our state first.

Now where I’m asking if I’m being selfish and unreasonable is that I still want to go work these camps while my family doesn’t want to risk it and don’t want me to attend this year. I mentioned the new health and safety precautions being taken, the number of people attending being greatly reduced(on a busy week we easily accommodate more than five hundred campers plus staff and chaperones though it’s rare when that happens), new sanitation procedures, and trainings made available and we just happened to be lucky enough to be in a state where free Covid testing is offered(you check to see if your state offers it through projectbaseline.com that’s how I found out), and that we would be as safe as possible. They argued that while all of that is very reassuring that they’re taking a lot of things into consideration it still doesn’t sound worth it because someone who is asymptomatic can slip through the cracks and infect people and I kind of argued that while what they’re scared of is completely valid they’re also being a bit unfair with that because it feels like they want the directors to be in control of absolutely every factor when that’s just not realistic with the resources they have available at the time, all they can do is closely monitor how things go and change things out as soon as new information becomes available.
I also had to remind them that my UI can only last for so long so if I have an opportunity to work I want to take it because they don’t want me or my siblings getting jobs as essential workers, another reason why I want to go is for the sake of my own mental health. It was discovered early on that I’m not an indoors type of person, if I can go out I’ll go out and stay out for as long as possible but with quarantine I’ve been stuck inside for the last two months and it’s really starting to get to me in the form of unbearable cabin fever to the point I moved into a tent in our backyard and go on walks in the wooded area outside our neighborhood just so I can trick my brain into thinking everything is normal and regain some level sanity but that can only do so much.
They’re telling me that I’m being selfish for willing to risk myself and them by going and wanting to be outside and I’m starting to believe that I am but at the same time aren’t I risking my personal mental health by not going? A friend even offered to let me stay with them for two weeks after the camps are over(they work them too, it’s how we met) so we can monitor our health and then get checked just to be safe and I can even continue to live outside once I’m 100% without a doubt in the clear but they still aren’t budging on the matter or willing to talk it out while I’m trying to find some kind of middle ground",12May2020,1
12,"Hi! First post on this sub, not sure where to write this, but I wanted to get this out somewhere. Welcome to read, comment and/or point out my bullshit, I wanna get better. And terribly sorry for my grammar, tis one of many things I struggle with.

This has been since I know myself haha, but yea, i feel very awkward and guilty accepting or getting anything nice for myself.   
My birthday was the other day, I felt like finally, nothing is working, they'll probably do nothing, so I can be at peace for once...Nope... Everyone coming in with something... I even asked them not to get me anything since is shitty time haha. I don't deserve it, this year was pretty shitty and I did some bad decisions... The cake and the singing and giftings, all was very awkward, center of attention is something I was okay being as kid (as normally haha) but hated during teenage years and got stuck I guess... Maybe some trauma back then caused this... many shits happened... probably....

My boyfriend also tries to buy or get me to get stuff myself. Main way he tries is by asking if I like something that I see and if I say yes he tries to buy it immediately, and it gets annoying sometimes, but I understand, he really wants me to try and get over that feel, and he really loves me and that's one of ways of showing affection.  I got some nice necklaces... barely worn them... 

Every so often he asks to get me switch. No, that's too much. If I want it, I'll get it on my own, might take me a while. 

&amp;#x200B;

I realized also that the more expensive the gift is, the more guilt and actual pain my chest comes... or my gut?  Anyways, the feel is like ""oh wow, they made a big mistake, wrong person to give this to, i can't accept this, i done nothing good to get this""

&amp;#x200B;

But, I do love giving gifts. That's funny. Specially, handmade stuff. Like bleached shirts, jewelry, greeting cards etc... I never expect in the return, except a smile! I like their surprised and happy faces!

  
Is that selfish? Does someone else feel like that and I take that away from them by me feeling like this?

&amp;#x200B;

And another question would be how to overcome this? Be happy with myself? Accept myself? Raise my self-worth?   


I don't know... All I know is what I see... This type of ""behaviour"" or mood, not sure what to call it, can drag other people down,soo... I guess, at least with gifts, I can give them back something what they were looking for in first place, a smile of a surprise, not a guilty frown and a comment ""You shouldn't have, don't waste money on me!"".

14,"For context, last year I was high honors, and I've always been ""smart"" according to school standard. In about mid-October 2019 I woke up late for school and was just not feeling great so I asked my Mom if I could skip, she said sure so I didn't go to school. Since then its been a downwards spiral. I missed over 30 days of school this year- and my sister tried to kill herself again in November. She was appointed to a psych ward for about a month and it led into Thanksgiving and to mid-December which gave the holidays a somber tone. Anyways back to the main story- I became truent and had to go to court and then was forced to become homeschooled. I have terrible memories of my public school and the whole having-to-go to-court-because-of-it thing. So now every time I have to do homeschool work I just break down. I do 0-10 minutes of school a day and even then im just fucking over it. Ive tried to run away once (and got caught) and snuck onto the roof just yesterday (and surprise surprise, got caught. I think my parents thought I was going to jump.) Ive just caused so much pain to my family in legal fees, having to go to therapy, and the thought that I could have to re-do the grade. I want to just give up and  make my family better. I don't think I want to die, but I just want to not be here anymore. Sorry if this post is redundant and confusing but I just had to say it.",12May2020,2
15,"This might sound ridiculous. I've tried to research it for so long but have never found anything related to why I act like this. As the title says, I have very animalistic behaviors and have had so my entire life. There's more minor traits such as being very territorial, biting as a more natural means of self defense than hitting or kicking, and certain things involving scent I'm too embarrassed to get into.

Then there's the more major things. When I'm really sad, I whimper/whine like a dog might. When I'm mourning something, I will howl or yowl. When I'm upset or threatened, I'll growl or hiss depending on the situation. If I'm upset in a sudden-spike-of-anger manner, I snarl. When happy or excited, I wiggle my lower body (mentioned because I believe that is a sign of happiness in various animals, as well as the closest a human has to tail wagging). When very happy, I also purr. I even roll over to expose my belly as a sign of trust and happiness.

16,"Okay so some background info, I (18F) have very supportive, great friends. I’m in a very healthy and happy relationship. I’m very active on social media which people depend on to reach out to me with and i reach out to them via social media. 

However, where I live, quarantine is very strict. I’ve been stuck at home with my family and we don’t exactly get along very well. They’ve been this way for years. Both of my parents are alcoholics who hate each other. My sister and I don’t love living in this  often toxic environment. 

The other day, my dad was so drunk and ended up going to the hospital after an awful fall. When I talk to my friends about this, I do feel better but often because they distract me or I laugh about what’s going on in my home. Then, the situation feels like nothing. But my family is falling apart. I don’t care that much, but I know I should. I feel like I need to clear my head and cut off outside distraction and just deal with what is going on so I can care. I’m so used to being let down by my parents but I’ll be off to college this Fall and I’m even reconsidering that because I’m afraid to leave my sister with my parents. 

Is it a good/ healthy idea to tell my friends and BF that I need a week or so of no contact so I can focus on myself and family? They’ll want to help me which I’m grateful for, but I have no desire and no way of putting effort into these relationships. I need to sort out my family and myself.",12May2020,2

18,"My inner critic that used to put me down, tell me that I was pathetic and worthless, stemmed from more normal (but critical) thoughts like “I’m not involved enough” and “I’m not doing good enough” that sound a lot like my moms logic. She’s all the self doubting questions in my head. I just noticed that every time I make a decision around her she launches into questions about whether that’s really the best choice or whether I’m really prepared or whatever. She’s only considering all the options but it’s unconsciously how I’ve learned to think about my decisions and why I’m so indecisive I think. She’s not abusive whatsoever dw but she used to get really upset when I wouldn’t be on top of things and it felt personal. “I’m not doing enough and it’s my own fault” I’d think. And it’s be true because it’s my fault I procrastinated. But her words sort of stuck with me and my thoughts spiraled down into self hatred. Those true enough thoughts turned into “I’m lazy and stupid” which turned into “I’m pathetic, I’m worthless, I hate myself”, etc. She never said anything terrible to me like my own thoughts but I’ve realized she’s what started them. Now I am aware when she says things that start me doubting myself and I am able to recognize that there is no need for me to beat myself up about it. Just keep going and keep up the self love and do my best. I’m more than likely doing ok anyways. Perspective.",12May2020,4

I had a broken sleep last night because I went to bed sober for the first time in over a year, which I anticipated. I took some melatonin and had a cup of tea to help relax me. I was scared about sleeping sober because I have pretty bad anxiety anyway and struggle to sleep, but it's okay. I got past the hurdle that I was most worried about. 

Today I have been craving smokes only when I'm bored, which is why I decided to write this so that I can keep track of how I am feeling. Slowing up my drinking doesn't worry me as much as stopping smoking does. 

But all well. I'm taking it hour by hour right now. As long as I'm drinking a lot less overall and not smoking, I'm happy. But no more wine. Definitely no wine. If I HAVE to consume alcohol, it's a vodka sodawater which I don't enjoy nearly as much as red wine.",12May2020,1

35,"I have severe racism OCD, but it's often hard to tell what's OCD and what's my implicit inborn biases. I have and benefit from white privilege, and nothing I have done has helped anyone else outside of my race. Every day there is some form of racism going on that I can benefit from, and even though it hurts me deeply that this happens, there is nothing I can do to change their experiences and being white is being born a racial sinner. At least, that's what I keep telling myself. 

I know I can't change the past, and I know that what many police officers do is terrible. I want to learn from other's experiences and not keep repeating history, but I live in such a deep state of shame that whenever I try to join those conversations, I fear I will be shunned, judged, and humiliated by others for being who I am because of the things white people have done and continue to do. And for the most part, they're right and I deserve it. 

But I still want to make progress and be a good person despite being who I am. Even being an ally can be considered overcompensating because white people tend to get offended for other people due to the crushing guilt we deserve to face. I want to change my mind though.

I want to not be ashamed for something out of my control (me being white), and if I'm going to do something about it, I have to stop living my life as an apology for things I don't believe and haven't done. Every single day ""n****r"" this and ""n****r"" that blast through my mind as a part of my OCD. Every day I'm afraid that having a white identity has an implicit and inborn disrespect for any and all outsiders, and every day is just another confirmation of how awful I am to other people who aren't white. I can pacify myself with ""i'M nOT a rAcISt"" all I can damn well please, but even saying that is denying who I am for what I am. 

Maybe this is a side effect of years of previously untreated OCD. My biggest fear in life is that I won't be a good person. My biggest fear in life is stepping on others, being greedy, mean, hateful, and generally unhelpful, if not useless in general. I'm probably only posting this for cheap karma or to get ass pats from other people for reassurance, but I still wanted to get this off my chest because every day is like this and I haven't been able to change how I feel about myself and my identity.",12May2020,1

 I was always considered a tomboy, I wore clothes from the boy section and preferred to play with the boys. I was lucky to have very supportive parents.

I just thought of my self as weird or different and that was it. 
It wasn’t until middle school (and essentially puberty) that I became aware that I am female. To fit in I kept quiet and wore ‘casual’ clothes. For unrelated reasons, I despised drawing attention to myself. 
I developed slowly and found myself wearing a push-up bra every day until sophomore year of high school. I just wanted to feel good about myself.

Recently our captain and co-captain graduated and at the same time the coach is going to resign because his reputation kind of got tarnished a bit (The resignation hasn’t happened yet, he personally called myself and our now ex captain and we were told to keep stuff under wraps) and go to coach elsewhere. I am the number 3 singles player at my college and the numbers 1 and 2 were the captain and co captain. I naturally want to become captain and I have been working my butt off for 2 years now, always support teammates, lead where I can, am friendly to all, and have the most experience on the team.

I could use some advice. I was thinking about texting the coach and asking him for the captainship. Or maybe getting the current team and kind of asking to kind of get their permission to get the captain role.

However, these kind of seem selfish in my eyes because bothering the coach right now seems like I only care about me and the teammate option makes me look and feel almost selfish and needy in a sense.

What should I do? Thank you in advance.

To tell all of those guys and girls out there that are chubby or a bit ''fat'' as some call it, that there's people out there looking for that. ♥  


All of this starts around 2010 (11 at the time) I met my first Boyfriend (All of the relationships are long distance, to give a clue of the situation)  
We met in Facebook, he got his eye on me for a long time, and i wasn't sure about my sexuality at that time, and, after like 6 months of him trying, i said ''I guess i'll never know until i try'' And we had a relationship, all nice, etc etc.

After a couple of weeks, he was complaining about hes weight and all that stuff, and at that time i was just ''It's not that bad, why you think that, etc''  
I always've been a skinny guy, so, i didn't undestand the ''chubby bullying'' they get all the time.  
So, at that time, he just showed me a photo of his belly with the message ''Here it is, now you can just shame me''  
Oh boy that backfired to him, i fell IN LOVE with it. I never met someone ''chubby'' at until then and i was obsessed with it, every single day i had to say something about it.

Month passed and we broke up (Because of stuff around, not gonna say much about it)  


But, that opened a door for me that i never knew i liked, and after the relationship, i always tryied to be extremely lovely to all of those guys or girls that just felt like ''This body will never get any love''  
Nah, F\*\*\* that. It might take some time, but you'll get that love. ♥

And i don't wanna sound like ''Obsessive'' about it, just want to say this from all of those that i used to give love because of their chubbiness, since it helped them. Take care of that beautiful body, the right person will show up to love you like that ♥ (That sounds so cliche, i know), but i mean it. :3  


Sorry to make such a big post, just wanted to leave this out there, always wanted to give a word about this.

79,"To give some perspective I'm 19 and in college. I'm not a middle schooler or high schooler, however it's been an issue since then. The problem is even more complicated since I had a brain tumor when I was 10 (it's 100% gone don't worry about it) so it's unknown if it's a mental problem related to the tumor or not. It's almost the end of the semester and I'm worried I'm gonna fail my english course. This would be the second time I've failed the same english course too for the same reason: lack of work done. I've had it. It's as if I have a phobia of doing homework. I had forgotten how I did homework in the past. My loving parents tried to help. I had an IEP (program that helps disabled students) in HS but it barely helped at all. It's ironic that the goal of the program was to help me become more independent but it only made it so I can only get myself to do the homework in that space. That, and it made me feel that I'm stupid. I want to use the ""r"" word since it's insensitive, but mentally I felt like I was when I was doing the program. My mom wants to do similar programs but I refuse because I know I need more help than what a program can do. I need psychiatric help. I've also noticed I have very limited motivation to do much of anything, including the things I love like music . I can't help but remember one time I forced myself to do homework in HS and I was laughing. The type of laughing you do when you're uncomfortable or anxious. I think about that a lot.

The worst part of all of this is my parents don't know I failed my courses last semester.  I've lied to them. I wasted money because I just want to sit on my ass and ignore schoolwork. I'm debating dropping out of college to find myself and get rid of the demons that plague me, but then what would my parents think? I want to be clear that I WANT to graduate from college, as someone may infer that I'm being forced to go by my parents, but they really only encouraged me.

Because it isn't about me. It is always having a ""you"" mindset. That was how I grew in all areas in my life.

I used to play football (soccer), i am currently injured for 4 years now, with an injury which can only be cured by operation, which my father is reluctant to.

I have friends, but i am the least liked person in the ""gang"".  

I am simp, and i would do anything for a female companionship.

I am too afraid to try new things and expand my horizons and use my skills(if i had any) somewhere good.

The only thing i can do is dramatize every situation, overthink and fuck everything up.

In conclusion, i feel like a complete waste, which is probably true. 

So hey, happy fucking birthday to me.",12May2020,1

I passed all my classes, did extra driving, but my permit expired last summer. it was hard for me to pass my permit but I eventually did. I don’t want to go through the whole permit thing again. someone told me that they don’t need you to have your permit. i’m not sure because I would think you need permit. if anyone knows please tell me. don’t judge me, I also been at boarding school so i’m behind.",12May2020,1
86,"This is probably a stupid place to put this and I don't want to go into a lot of detail about it but I'm pretty sure that I have some kind of severe (non-psychotic, more emotional) mental illness which is progressively getting worse over the years and ruining my life and my capacity to do anything. I've been trying for years to manage it on my own but I just can't.

My family - with whom I live, having never been able to do anything which might lead to a semblance of independence or adulthood - are useless, worthless people whose version of caring sucks and is a major part of why I am like this to begin with. I can't rely on them and I don't have any friends in person I could go to for support, and even if I did, there's a quarantine. I have no money. I have nothing. I need a real therapist - and not that 7cups bullshit either - but I don't know how to get one in such constrained circumstances. Can somebody help, somehow?",12May2020,1

88,"I'll be the first to admit, I'm not that much of a baby person myself. I rarely post on Facebook and I generally have a very cynical view of social media. That's not to say I don't appreciate the occasional picture of one's family, accomplishments, etc. That's the point of it. But why is it half the mom's on my feed (most of whom) stay at home or barely work feel the need to post everythinggggg. Why do you need to let us know your kids slept in till 830? Why do you need to show us that you made a basic, mediocre dinner or that you folded all the clothes in your house? I don't get it. Now I know this annoys me more than it should, and I could hide their posts but I just want to know WHY do you do it?!? And why do other people ""like"" and comment on their shit. Why do you encourage this behaviour?? What satisfaction do you get from live posting your boring, monotonous life? And mom's out there who are reading this ...do you get just as annoyed?",12May2020,1
89,"OK. So this all started when I made a post on r/atheism saying that I finally revealed to my parents that I’m an agnostic atheist. Then this guy tried convincing me to become a gnostic atheist by comparing believing in God to believing in Santa or unicorns. I said that’s not a good comparison, because disproving Santa and unicorns is 10000x easier than disproving the existence of a god/gods.

Fast forward, and now he keeps replying to my other comments I made, which were in completely different subreddits and had nothing to do with atheism, saying to “confirm my beliefs” and that “I’m wrong”. I can’t make him stop, and he keeps doing this. How do I make him stop?",12May2020,1

97,"I need to write this some where.

My 2 year 5 month old daughter had a very difficult start to life. She has brain injury and in utero brain damage (from a virus called CMV). 

when she was born she has early onset sepsis and was on life support with heart, lung and liver problems as well as trying to survive meningococcal sepsis. 

When she was 4 weeks old she had an MRI and they told us what had happened in her brain and it was not good. Polymicrogyria, cysts, calcifications, bi lateral ventriculomegaly (measuring severe), less white matter and a stroke to the cerebellum. CMV also causes deafness. Horrible virus that lives in the spinal circulation system wreaking havoc in the brain and central nervous system.

Now the first thing I did was reach out to other mother's who's kids had been effected by CMV and I can tell you my daughter's prognosis was awful. Their kids had similar of not less damage to the brain and they were wheel chair bound. I am still in contact with several mothers. At the time they were a help but also I compared Bodhi to their kids and I don't think it helped. 

I hated my body for not protecting her and cried daily for the first year of her life.

At first we didn't know if she was going to walk, then she lost hearing so I mentally prepared myself for cochlear implants. I've taught her sign. She did walk and then her hearing loss stopped at mild. At 14 months she was like any normal baby, then I dreaded her being developmentally delayed, being on the spectrum, what would happen to her when I die, I'm in my mid thirties who hasn't got much of a family. My part we her father is older still. 

Today I got the a report back from a development test. She is average and above average for everything except speech which is coming. 

She also recently had an MRI and her neurologist said she has a lot of repair, still large ventricles, still cysts and calcifications but the stroke has healed and she has more white matter. 

Today I let out a huge breath I hadn't realised I'd been holding for years. My baby girl is going to have a life. She can go to university, or have kids and a family of her own. 

I see her and I know she is doing well, I'm teaching her to spell, she understands numbers and letters, I love to teach her. But to know that a Doctor's do too, and maybe I'm not just being hopeful has given me relief.

Today is a good day and my daughter is a walking miracle.",12May2020,1

Its crazy how we forget about everything. Shoutout to the homo erectus for holding it down for us. Why do weaker groups of entities almost always get exploited heavily by a group at a greater advantage? If this the way of the universe? I mean, the sun has the advantage over earth for example. I feel like this is the end. I’m definitely wrong but I don’t know I just don’t care. It seems that no matter what you tell people, nobody cares. It’s just weird how we exist to just exist.

105,"I fell in love with computers very early on in my childhood. It became a passionate hobby and passtime starting writing software and games when I was 9. It wasn't too long to realize what I wanted to do for a living: build software. However, when I started passing through my career, what I loved so much as a hobby became a hatred for me in the professional world.

Programming was a way to express my creativity but at work I was barred from doing that. I ended up becoming a backend developer writing boring entreprise web servers. It was worse when they lied on my statement of work doing something completely out of my line of expertise. I started to hate it.

Writing software has become associated with boredom for me. I haven't done any personal projects in years probably from burnout working at these giant companies or small startups. I came home drained of energy and often it was from doing nothing. I'm tired.

I initially did Uber as a necessity but once I was back in my field I continued working for them. I did a very long shift on Saturday from 3:30 PM to 1:30 AM. Despite the fatigue that came from driving for so long, I never thought about the last hour of my shift. The freedom of driving and exploring the City of Ottawa and the interactions with human beings brought me so much relief from sitting in a closed room or cubicle. Despite the paltry pay and the torture on the car, I haven't stopped doing it for close to a year and a half now part-time. I got closer to home.

However, my life changed when I started my own blog and wrote a 70 page essay on why I left Islam. I realized that I loved writing so much. The feedback was good mostly complimenting my flow. I finally felt that I had a way to express my creativity and had the freedom to do what I want. This was my calling.

I want to write articles, essays, books on things I find interesting. I've written on subjects that no one else has before. Funny posts and morbid posts. The ethics of society and work. Anything running through my mind could be expressed in text both prosaic and poetic.

I dream to do it all on my own and make a living out of it. However, I feel like the probabilities are against me and I'm destined to fail. I know that I won't discover that until I try but I'm too scared to put my extremely well paying career for something that will have me on the streets begging for cents.

I'm mad at myself for not having faith. I've instead chosen to continue being in the sweatshop that is the professional world of software engineering. With a 20 page resume, I built so much experience and I don't like showing off, but I'm really good at what I do. However, I'm so constrained and sometimes I was thrown out for being ""over-creative"" and being too vocal. I tried so hard to voice my concerns and bring new ideas to the table, but it was to my demise.

I should listen to myself but I'm too scared and stubborn to.",12May2020,1

107,"I’ve (23/F) had a few problems with sleep paralysis in the past, though it’s only happened a few times. You know, I see/hear things, but can’t move. After the first time or two, the fear mostly went away. The weirdest thing I saw was a duck man playing the violin in front of me. The other times it was fairly normal things, like my ex-boyfriend, dogs moving around, etc. 

But recently, maybe within the past month, I’ve been hearing voices. It’s only when I’m on the verge of falling asleep or am first waking up in the morning. Usually at night, I can hear the talking but I can’t make out what’s being said. I have to ignore it so that I can fully fall asleep. Though there are instances like this morning where I heard a woman’s voice clearly saying, “fuck!” Which obviously made me paranoid enough to search around for anyone in the house, but there wasn’t anyone.

Once I’m fully awake, as well as throughout the day, I typically don’t hear anything. It’s just pretty scary because my sister is bipolar, and both parents who are no longer in my life suffer from mental issues. I don’t want to end up with any sort of similar diagnosis. So here I am, pouring my heart out. I guess I’m getting on the crazy train, though my sister is fairly normal at most times, just can’t really control her mood swings.

My question is, how can people be always confident of themselves ? I am not who I want to be now, and I know that is OK and I am trying to become who I want to be, my best self but I don't know, my motivation is so low. I feel alone and I don't really love myself to be honest. Sometimes I feel confident and I feel like I don't need no one, I feel like I love myself but it just goes away way too quick. I make plans to become a better person, I make plans to like work out, spend some time for myself but I don't really follow my plans. Any kind of bad memory/ bad incident or  just seeing someone way better than me, makes me sad and depressive. I feel like I am unstable. How can I love myself CONSTANTLY, not just some moments. I don't need to hear what everyone says everytime, it just doesn't work. When I feel happy and confident of myself, I feel like it is just my brain tricking me to believe it. 

I admit it, I don't love myself and I am feeling alone, and I actually don't know what to do except trying to trick my brain. I need help. I don't want to be like this, both mentally and physically. I am not who I want to be, and even though I know that is okay and I should work for becoming who I want to be, idk it just doesn't change anything. I just want this up-down constantly changing mood to go away. I want to be confident and happy of myself everytime, not just moments. Please help me.

The engine of the business was getting hundreds of new customers per year.  


Then, last year, ANGI Inc (Homeadvisor/AngiesList), along with other multi-state large competitors, bought out all the adspace - To complete, I'd have to pay over 43% of the job price. I can't raise my price, as I'm at the point where I'd lose too many customers based upon past experience.

I did not want to go because I didn't think I fit in and everyone was so tall and scary. Then, during second hour, I stepped into your classroom for the first time. You were young, kind, and obviously a little nervous to be there too. Yet, you still were happy to be there. You were kind to me and, when you chose me for the student of the quarter award during third quarter, we talked and I knew you were a special person. I went on to Spanish 3, which I never thought I would, and I had you again. I started hanging out in your classroom and talking with you more because the friends I had were not good people. Then, at the end of sophomore year, my grandma died and I found out when I was talking with you. The next year, I grew even quieter than I used to be. I dropped out of the activities that I used to love, stopped talking to friends, failed classes, and had a plan. You noticed one day when I stopped coming to school. You asked me if I was okay. I said I was tired.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, a few weeks later, I came into your classroom crying. You knew something was wrong long before that. You sat down with me and talked for hours in your classroom. You made me promise that you would see me again tomorrow and notified my parents and the school counselor and wouldn't let me leave without one of my parents. I was terrified. You saved me that night. I planned for that night to be my last night on Earth.

Now, I have graduated college with summa cum laude honors. I meet my students in the fall. I will be a Spanish teacher. I'm here because of you. Gracias.",12May2020,1
