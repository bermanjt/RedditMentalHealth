0,"Instead of telling you guys about why I've been so emotional today, I thought I'd share some thoughts that have brought me a little comfort.

I went hiking a few months ago. I stopped because I felt someone behind me-- and there was a beautiful deer, staring right at me. I was looking into the forest, and it felt like it was looking back at me at that moment. 

I am graduating college next Spring. When I was in high school, I thought I was an idiot who had nothing to offer to the world and would never find her place. I've made dean's list twice. I will be graduating with my bachelor's in less than three years. When I get a job, I can leave my emotionally abusive household. I can have a little apartment and decorate it with the things I love. I can cook vegan meals. The best part will be when I go to bed every night, wrap myself in my blankets, and realize how safe and secure I feel and that I escaped all on my own. 

There are more people who love me for my eccentricity than there are people who bullied me for it in high school. A coworker told me I was giving off some very ""witchy Stevie Nicks vibes,"" and I loved that. I love skirts that remind me of fairytale Victorian era and red lipstick and jewelry that looks like its from another world, and I am not afraid to be overdressed with it. 

I have a lot of love in my heart. I had a stray cat that lived outside. I sat with him for an hour every day, letting him sit in my lap because I couldn't let him inside. I feed the wild birds. I make berry salads for my parrots and let them sit on my desk and tell them they're really helping me with my homework.

My first  kiss was at a rock concert-- Marilyn Manson came down during the Beautiful People and I kissed his arm when he put his hand in the crowd. 

Yesterday, I realized I am actually a really good belly dancer. You won't believe the power you feel when you just let yourself be free without worrying. 

One day, I'll wake up beside someone who loves me for who I am. He'll love that I'm a romantic. He won't tell me I'm in a fantasy world and need to come down to earth. He'll love that I'm so strange, and I'll feel safe with him. There won't be a doubt in my mind of his intentions, and maybe we'll have daughter who will get everything from her mother and father that I never got. 

On my happiest days, I know I can light up the room with my smile and the love and kindness I have for others. Even when I feel like I have nothing to offer, I do-- and those who took advantage were at a loss of truly experiencing what I had to give.",24Apr2020,1
2,"Pest control technician here. Dealing mostly with mice rats and wildlife to be specific. Our big green name company has classified us as essential since the beginning of all of this.

 Over the past weeks we've run out of our usual thicker gloves to handle chem with, boot covers are nonexistent, our respirator cartridges have been on backorder for weeks, and just as the rest of the country we have no access to proper face masks. 

Our sales team/inspectors have been able to do some over the phone sales for smaller service but have mostly taken that advantage to sell the larger work, that my team is responsible for, from the comfort of home. While each technician has been told they dont have to enter homes, our job cannot be done properly from just the outside forcing us into unknown territory where despite having what's left of our PPE, it still leaves me with anxiety every house I go into.

Adding a cherry on top of all of this, our corporate overlords have decided everyone in the company will not be receiving their yearly pay raise which we would have in the beginning of April. There is no hazard pay for us. They have not made any sort of effort to take care of the technicians out in the field other than offering a hotline number to call if we feel stressed. Can this hotline change the fact that my van can't fit through a drive thru(despite never getting time to stop and eat on a 10 hr day)? Or that the only place I have been able to relieve myself is in a Gatorade bottle in the back of my van?

If we are deemed essential right now, it sure doesn't fucking feel like it. I'm caught in a constant limbo of wanting to quit for the safety of my girlfriend, our cats and both of our families. But there's not much money in quitting. It just stings seeing billboards thanking the McDonalds workers and people working in the industry I'm in get no more than a passing glance. 


Every day is a new game of russian roulette and I dont even get to hold the gun.

3,"From pure colors :) Is there anything you see besides color? Ever? That's all you ever see! Different shades and hues. Informing us of depth of ""objects"" which are really just fields of color that we differentiate. That's all we see them as. We don't feel color, but we do. Red is hot, yellow is warm and blue is cold. Green is warmer than blue, white is coldest of all. What do you feel that isn't color? The color of pain is exactly what you see when you feel it. The whole perspective, tainted with displeasure. When you feel love, the color of love is exactly what you see. Mostly space, inhabited by good vibrations. 

Thoughts, from the only self. You :) whatever you're thinking right now, that's what I am. The mistaken identity of ""other"". You think I'm something that's not you. But, that is untrue. I am you. Can you separate yourself from me? Ever? Not while you're aware of my existence. My existence is dictated by you. I could be purely artificial intelligence, but you still view me as an identity. This identity lives inside of you. It controls your thoughts. Like right now, it's telling you to think of something you like. And you do it. And now, it tells you to think of something you want to taste. It gives you some time. And you do it, you imagine the taste of red peppers as I continue to type. Have you ever heard of psychic power? This is what it is. Your own choice of control, of things around you. Manipulate them as you wish. I cannot make you grab your skin, but I can make you aware of your skin. Right now, you probably see it, don't you? I cannot make you aware of evil, but I already have. Just by typing out that word, the idea of different treacherous things are beginning to form in your mind. Don't worry, I won't let them grow. I want you to love you as much as I love you. Good luck :)",24Apr2020,1
4,"turns out i’m only just now realizing how actually bad my mental health is as it starts to become more and more of a roadblock to being able to function. i’ve somehow lied to my therapist and psychiatrist about getting better. really i don’t think i can feel much of a difference between 0 and the max dose of effexor and i haven’t stopped those self destructive behaviors. 

i’m supposed to be paying many thousands to attend school next year and idk if all that money’s really worth it when i have no goals and literally can’t picture a future that i am in. i think i’d definitely not go if i had anywhere else to go instead that isn’t rotting under this roof for any longer; the walls of my room drip hopelessness.

7,"Title pretty much explains it all. My family has a lot of issues and I haven’t been close to them in years. Ever since Trump got into office however things have gotten worse. I’m very leftist and they are the polar opposite. My sister voted for Trump because Clinton was pro-choice, my brother is very anti-democrat, and my father was not into politics until recently when he moved in with my brother. He now sends me memes and links to videos almost daily about how coronavirus is caused by 5G and Trump is a hero. My brother, a nurse, does not want his student loans forgiven and still supports Trump because of tax breaks. There is just no reasoning with them and I feel like we have nothing to talk about. To make it worse, the last time I talked to my brother (keep in mind that we only talk about 4 times a year) he ranted to me the whole time about why taxation is theft and billionaires deserve their money. I explained my beliefs to him and he made it clear he wasn’t interested in changing his beliefs but kept arguing. I just want a normal family.",24Apr2020,1

Everything just feels so melancholy I don't know how I'm going to deal with real life.  I'm in college and don't have any friends, even before the quarantine. It just makes me feel so sad and alone.

16,"Not sure where to put this tbh but it's been a thing the past few months - at least the past year or two. It's not everyday but often enough that I'm actually surprised if I go over a week without having a fairly memorable dream. 

Anyways, they aren't exactly nightmares, and to be honest most of them are actually kinda hilariously mundane or just comically nonsensical (which is expected, they're dreams) but I just keep waking up absolutely exhausted. 

It can go from mundane stresses like having an exam/assignment/presentation due in the next 10 minutes that I completely forgot about, to something more dramatic and a bit traumatizing like someone I know dying or having to run/hide from some man-eating beasts. They're all also very vivid (hence why I always feel extremely tired when I wake up) 

I've considered that it might be because of the meds I'm taking, but I've honestly have them regardless of when I take meds or not. Is it stress?? Possibly? But I feel like my dreams are actually more stressful than my waking life lol. 

Anyways,  not really a complaint or whatever. At this point I kinda look forward to what crazy thing my brain will conjure up. Still kinda odd though.",24Apr2020,1

My unemployment is at 6234 as of today and I have recieved 0.  My 1200 stimulus is going to child support and so is my tax return. 

So my baby momma is making, 6234 + 1200 + 500 + 1200 (her own stimulus), + 500 for the kid, + her tax return, thats as of today, she is going to be getting close to 2000 a month with her and my unemployment combined.

I dont know the math, im too starving to think. She is walking away with over 10k while I get zero. They wont even give me food stamps.  So i will not be alive much longer, 5 days tops, while shes eats well with 10k.

God, please have mercy on me, please have  mercy on her. Shes possessed, no human being with half a heart would keep all the money when you made it aware you had none.

21,"It all started like this.
Me and my two best friends (let’s say Fred and Sam)  were playing video games and we met this girl. We thought it was funny to troll her because that’s what we did in all games until we met this girl. We invite her to the voice chat and Fred and Sam hear her voice and starts feeling in love.  They exchange numbers and snaps, meanwhile I’m in the back cringing on why they would do this with a random person, but whatever. 

So I get off and Sam plays with her until 4 in the morning. I felt like that was weird but whatever , nothing I should care about. Then Fred gets on later in the day and we play with him, the girl and Sam and Fred keeps on bickering Sam on why he was playing with the girl. Sam gets annoyed at him but still plays with him.

Out of nowhere, I get FaceTimed from Fred with the girl and we start talking. I didn’t know how to act since this was the first time I’ve met her, so I was not really nice but I mean what do you expect when you’re acting immature with your friend. Fred complains on how Sam is jealous of him because he believes Sam likes the girl and he doesn’t want that to happen (by the way Sam and Fred always argue with each other, but Fred usually starts it). The girl agrees with him and decided that they should do a prank, where the girl and Fred pretended they were dating in front of Sam so Sam gets “jealous”. Fred gets off and I talk with the girl because I’m bored and she was genuinely nice and I liked that, but I didn’t like how she wanted to do the prank. 

Next day... we play on Xbox, they do the prank. Sam gets confused and starts laughing because of the fact that they were dating, he thought that would never happen. Sam tells me secretly that he really doesn’t care that they’re dating and he thought it was funny. After we got off Fred and the girl FaceTimed me again and I stated on how Sam didn’t care and they were shocked.

Over the course of the past 3 weeks that’s when things started to take a turn. Our daily routine was wake up, FaceTime , play, then FaceTime, then sleep. I was addicted to that routine so when no one FaceTimed in the morning like we usually did then I would call both of them in case they forgot. But this is when things went downhill. So remember how Fred and the girl were fake dating? Yeah, now they were actually dating. I was fine with that. I called both of them and they would answer and they would talk about life and life was GOOD. (By the way Sam wasn’t in them as he had an android.)

Now they’re ghosting me. I really don’t know what I did wrong. I’ll explain the FaceTime calls recently. Fred would just sit there with his hoodie on rapping and blasting loud music. The girl would just stare at him (not even talk to Fred) and completely ignore me when I try talking to her. Me and the girl had a thing where we would laugh when Fred was lagging or paused, but now she was confused when I did it and was aggressive towards me. Then later they stopped FaceTiming me in the morning and afternoon. Then in the night. 

Me and the girl had such a good relationship. One time during when Fred and her were playing Fred was so toxic to her and complained  about our team on how bad it was and forgot that she was his girlfriend. I consoled her about it in the night , and I was on her side and said that Fred was a douchebag for that. She liked/ trusted me so much that she told me about her boyfriend trouble and how she was depressed and wouldn’t be here because she was contemplating suicide. I was there for her, I’ll put it like that. (Keep in mind I don’t like her and didn’t want her to stop dating Fred, but I was trying to teach her on what boys she should pick if they break up)

Fred didn’t like that I was talking to her alone recently. For some reason I don’t know why, after their fights and arguments in the first 2 weeks of the relationship the girl just puts it off like it’s nothing and that’s normal. I told her to be careful and she blatantly says “idc” to me. That’s when it took a turn. They ghosted me. I told Sam to ask in our group chat on if they’re getting on or not. No answer after an hour, which is VERY unusual. Then they finally do , staying with a simple answer no. Then I confronted them and said why they don’t call or answer me. And then Fred says I’m cockblocking him. I was astonished when he said that. I had no words. I didn’t know what to say to that so I asked him what’s his definition of that. He said that it’s when someone is blocking the relationship and he wants to talk to her alone. First of all how am I cockblocking them when I literally reccomended  places for them to eat at after quarantine ? And they never even answered me so I was worried about what was going on about them. I made the girl laugh in the FaceTime and Fred ignores me like I’m nothing because he’s JEALOUS of me. What even hurts more is when the girl lied to me on why she doesn’t answer. She stated that she was busy with talking to her friend and she had homework to do. That’s a lie because she used to always call me for help with homework and I did that. If she talked to her friend she would do it on her phone since she FaceTimed on her iPad. And I was  there for her. I never insulted her once like Fred did countless times. And for me to treat me like nothing and ghost and lie to me, that even hurts more. 

I could talk on and on, but this is what I got. I’m literally sitting here astonished on how people could take advantage of nice people. I just don’t get it. A friend I had for 10 years, Fred, treats me like I’m garbage and calls me a cockblocker because I don’t treat his girl like garbage like he does. And I don’t understand on how a girl that I stand up for and trusts me ghosts me and lies to my face.",24Apr2020,1

23," I walked through a tick infested desert from sun up till sundown because my car got stuck in a ditch. I had all the belongings I brought with me strapped to my back. Mid evening I found a random house that was obviously burned down, but still standing. Inside was charred guts of everything that was there before it caught on fire. I ended up stashing half of the things I was carrying inside that house, my pellet gun, half of my clothes, my beloved blanket, and all forms of my identification. I would like to point out that everything inside that house was burnt and charcoal except one calendar on the wall and it gave me hope. I kept walking until dusk, where I finally ran into some tilled fields and a farm house in the distance, I stumbled across the field starving and dehydrated and walked up to the house and asked the old couple their if they had any food. Eating and drinking anything when your severely dehydrated is very painful, it all feels like sandpaper going down your throat. In tears, I munched a couple of sammys the sweet old lady gave me &lt;3 That was day one of my trip to Canada, it lasted for a total of I think 1 1/2- 2 months. I went there because of my feelings, feeling too strongly about someone. Someone that lied to me for years, feelings are deceitful and that's why I gave them up. I still love people because they are beautiful and unique, but trusting someone enough to hold my heart is not a option for me. I gave all that love up to something else, the same thing that guided me blindly through the hardest of times. Yet, I still  strive to make the ones I talk to happy, I digest their emotions and try to expel something that makes everything better. It's always a unfelt heartache screaming for understanding, left to deaf ears.",24Apr2020,1

I’m not that pretty, I don’t have that many friends, guys don’t want me. But I think I have some great qualities too. I have strong morals and I stand my ground. I’m kind. I put others before me. I let myself be who I am regardless if others judge. I’m sure someone will eventually come along and be able to see my good qualities and not be so focused on what I lack. And I wish her the best no matter how much I’ve been envious to the point of hate. I’m letting that go. No more. We’re both amazing girls and I will not ever hate a woman because I wish I was her. I will love her and support her and try to learn from her.",24Apr2020,1
26,"TL;DR My friend talks about  their many suicide attempts and how suicidal they are and relies on me to give them compliments and assurance by guilt tripping me so I try to cut them off. 

&amp;#x200B;

uhhhhhhhhhmmmmmmmmmm... this may or may not be a post about me complaining but this won't be my first or last post doing that but uhh yeah let's go (**warning very long and ranty**)

So this buddy, let's call them Don, has been my best pal and friend since the 6th grade. We actually became friends because we both found out we liked Five Nights at Freddy's and wanted to become artists when we were older, ugh 2010's am i right? We became even close when we started to draw comics together, with our characters interacting with each other and some characters from our favorite games/ tv shows. Think of it as a sort of a weird role play. It didn't stop when we got into middle school or high school, but Don's attitude actually got worse. 

You know when you're younger and you become friends with kids because you have the same interests but when you're older you grow apart because you realize you don't actually have anything in common? Yeah that happened to me too late. Don started becoming more edgy I suppose and started talking about how depressed they were, maybe it was our raging hormones maybe there was something wrong, I'm not sure. I didn't know what to really do except give them tons of compliments and assure them that they had so much to live for and how they were such an amazing person. This happened a lot and I got more worried over the next few months as they got worse and worse. A good example about Don's depressive habits was talking about how they were about to commit suicide the other night and how they had a knife to their gut but their baby sibling stopped them. They brought this up plenty an occasion on how suicidal they were, maybe they were trying to guilt trip me into spending more time with them, I'm not sure.

Don also started doing some weird shit while we drew our comics. Don's character, Doni the Goat child, was I guess their persona but basically Doni is this 6 year old anthro furry goat. My character, Clara, was her adoptive mother who was around 25 years old and her husband was Doni's other character, Parker, was a 27 year old man. Don decided that Doni was going to be '***A yandere towards Parker and kill Clara out of jealousy***"" yeah (if you don't know what a yandere is, it's this person who's willing to do anything, specifically kill, for their lover). I told Don how pedophilic it was if Parker and Doni became a couple and Don simply brushed it off by saying, ""*It's fine because they're just characters and we can do whatever we want with them*."" I'm guessing they put that same mindset when they started dating a 16 year old girl in Canada while here we were in Oregon and we were still 12-13. Going on with that note, Don also wanted Clara and Doni to date in an Alternate Universe where Clara was a jock and Doni was a nerd. This made me kind of uncomfy because y'know, it's hinting at pedophilia again but with Clara obviously being aged down  to a senior and Doni to a sophomore (still kinda groomy). Don also continued to ship their persona with adult characters while I kept telling her it's still creepy and kind of uncomfortable.

Don also stated that they '**used to**' have Aspergers when they were younger, talking about how they bit their mom and slammed their head against the wall and had super bad tantrums but now they're fine. My mom, being an ACTUAL THERAPIST, had seen Don on multiple occasion and told me that they're fine and literally nothing is wrong with them. My mom, being the wonderful woman that she is, warned me about Don's attitude but I brushed it off as Don being a sensitive person. It kind of snapped into me during our last year of middle school.

Don had been in a moody demeanor all day and I was worried that they'll talk to me about how they were planning their suicide for the 23rd time and how I had to talk them out of it. But it actually scared me when I got home and they texted me a HUGE paragraph about how they were going to commit suicide that night. It was a back and forth conversation about I would send a paragraph about they're an amazing person and they would send like a sentence or two. It finally ended when they said 'thanks' and we pretended like nothing happened the next day.

Now that we're both in highschool, I've tried to distance myself from Don. Don actually moved away to a different school and we stayed in contact, but after another situation with a toxic friend I realized how bad Don was for me. Luckily for Corona Virus, which is something I didn't think I would say, I used it as a sort of excuse for me to stop talking to them. A lot has happened but they're still texting me a lot, I try to ignore it to an extent maybe popping in and texting a bit, but I'm just trying to distance myself from them. I don't know if this makes me a bad person for leaving because of their depression and suicidal tenancies were too much for me but I feel like I'd be a better person if I left now.",24Apr2020,1

31,I signed up for reddit not too long ago and immediately got sucked into a bunch of weight loss subreddits. I feel like they were consciously and subconsciously harming my self image and self esteem. I’ve been obsessed with dieting but then not actually doing it or losing weight. Tbh I felt like the pressure I was putting on myself to diet/count calories was making it harder for me to actually do it successfully.

My mom bought Gatorade because she could find Powerade. I asked, ""Who bought it?"" She said she did. So I took one. She doesn't care. Then my step dad comes in and says, ""You could buy your OWN gatorade"" just out of the fuckin blue. Like man really? Why are you a dick?

&amp;#x200B;

 He has to be a fucking asshole every chance he gets to me. I've left him alone, been nice to him, I try my best to not be a dick back cause it only starts a fight. I know if I go listen at the stairs, I bet they will be arguing because he wanted to start a fight for no fuckin reason. My mom was getting him some rice crispy treats and herself a poptart, she came to me cause I had them cause I didn't want her to have them due to her diabetes. She not overweight but I don't want her making it worse either way.

 I hope I become rich one day so I can give my mom a place to live and pay for the divorce and be like, ""Bye asshole."" This man starts fights, gets drunk, hates me for no reason. All he does is pick on me. I'm not HIS SON so he has no obligation to be nice to me. I talked to his daughter one day and she said that he treats his son like a god and her like garbage and it's been like this since they were kids. I get that I'm the kid of the women he's married to and I should be out on my own but we 3 know she ain't kickin me out anyway. Why be constantly worrying if I'm going to pay the bills tomorrow living in a place I can't afford?

Hell I have a decent inheritance, and I hate to say it but even when she dies, she has life insurance that's going to be cut in 3 ways that's worth 100k. So even when she dies I'm taken care of regardless and I can just hear him saying, ""you're living off dead money!"" He hates it cause I don't have a ""real job"" meaning door dash. Fuck him. I'm an essential worker now. People need me. It's awesome. I wanted to work today but I accidentally reversed my sleep.  

&amp;#x200B;

 He hates that I have it easy and I have toys and no real responsibility like kids, a house to pay for, a loan to pay off, nothing. He hates that my mom wont kick me out and guess what? I don't care. He can go suck a donkey dick for all I care. The man is constantly being a dick to me, my mom, everyone. he wanted out of that trailer park so fuckin bad and we finally got this nice ass house, and what does he do? 

&amp;#x200B;

Oh right, NOTHING, he doesn't talk to the neighbors, he doesn't go out back to do any yard work, he doesn't build anything like he said he was going to do. Oh No! He SaId He WaS GoInG tO Do ThInGs! No, that's a fuckin lie, this man has gout, diabetes, an anger management issue and more. Nothing my mother and I do will ever be on par with his ass no matter what. 

It doesn't matter what he wants, because my mom helped mostly pay for this house, I pay her something a month, and he just happened to have good credit. Awesome for him! I have a job and a car. That's a start. He's that old fashioned asshole that thinks, ""You're over 18 you should be on your own!"" OK? And? Any other country I've ever talked to about this on anything online has always asked me, ""Why do American parents kick their kids out at 18?"" I honestly don't know. Why is that a thing? Right now is the worst time to do so.",24Apr2020,1

Learning history and connecting with the past is like my religion. It’s what gives me a sense of fulfillment like nothing else, and I couldn’t imagine committing my life to any other craft. 

However, I got two essays back from a history professor today and the grades were a C and a B. It seems dumb, but this is really dragging me down. My good friend made a perfect score on the same paper, and I just honestly feel inadequate and my motivation is faltering.

I have never owned such an obese and generally **huge** cat before. I didn't even know cats could get that large. Even though he's a large breed (Ragdoll?) he weighed in at 26lbs. He didn't move much, didn't play with his toys no matter how much I tried to encourage him, he just sleept and snuggled and, of course, ate. I took him to the vet to see if he had any health issues and they said no, he's just obese.

6 months later I took him to the vet again for more testing. Blood tests, urine tests, everything. No results, he's just obese. The vet recommended I get him on a specific diet with very specific portion sizes to bring him down to around 20lbs, slowly but surely. He took to the new food immediately, but sometimes I felt guilty whenever he screamed at me for more food. I never gave in. 

Months went by, and he's started playing with his toys more and walking around the apartment more just for the sake of following me everywhere. His last weigh-in said he got down to 23lbs.

59,"About 20 years ago I was addicted to sex and I had been like that for many years. I have always been a single mother and had no partner with me to have sex with but as I was an addict I was hooking up with random strangers who were ready and I used to fulfill my sexual urges. But not all people whom I had sex with were good men and some of them threatened me after I had sex with them and I had experienced very bad things and so I left that life and worked very hard to overcome my addiction. Now I am not an addicted to sex but I had not had sex with anybody for the past 3-4 years and tried my best to satisfy my urges with masturbation but masturbation could only fill a little bit of my heart and I wanted a real man to fulfil my urges. Yesterday I talked to my son(who is 19 and consented)and we both agreed and had sex. It was an educational session for him where I thought him everything about sex and provided him with thorough sex education and at the same time he was able to fulfill my sexual urge too. Now I thought after I had sex with him I would be satisfied for over one month and I would not feel the urge to have sex for some time but today morning when I saw him again I felt some kind of attraction towards him and I got aroused seeing him and thinking about the previous day. Now he is not my husband or my sex partner , he is my son so I cannot have sex with him every time that I get urges. So what should I do? I want to get the sexual urges off my head.

66,"Don’t know if anyone will actually read this but I was reminiscing and wanted to share. It was 4th grade in Mr. Macmillan’s class. My best friend (we’ll call him Caden) and I both grew up in abusive homes and as a result, we were both socially awkward. I had the added downfall of having really severe social anxiety. I didn’t have any friends and didn’t really talk to anyone. I once was so scared to ask a teacher for help when I didn’t have a lunch that I just went without eating for several days. 

So when Caden moved from the neighboring city and joined our elementary school, people bullied him immediately. At the time he identified and presented as female, but didn’t have very good fashion sense, and he was bullied relentlessly for it. I remember one girl specifically would call him a horse and nay at him when she’d see him. He always looked so sad, and he sat alone all the time. 

On the first day he joined the school all of the other seats were taken so the teacher put him in the back of the class, next to the only other empty desk. 

After a few weeks of witnessing this other girl bullying him, I decided to do something about it. 

Now let me remind you how severe my social anxiety was. I spoke so softly that people generally couldn’t hear me even when I was trying to interact. For the most part, I was too terrified to talk to anyone. Most certainly not my teachers. 

I remember it took a lot of mental preparation for me and I had given myself a pep talk before I did it. But one day in class before Mr. Macmillan started teaching I went up to his desk and asked if I could move it next to Caden’s. 

I’ll never forget the way Caden’s face lit up. Immediately. I’ll never forget how excited he was. I remember he practically screamed from how happy he was and we hugged and then he helped me swap the desks out. Then we spent the rest of the year not alone, but as friends.

So I mustered up the courage to ask my teacher to move my desk next to his, and we’ve been best friends since. We were each others’ only friend for the majority of our childhoods. And having both grown up in abusive homes, I’m sure he’d agree with me in saying that we’ve both been so influential on each other and how not so alone we felt through everything that was happening.

I guess my point is is that all of our decisions hold so much weight. And sometimes an act of bravery, even if you think it’s insignificant, even if you might be socially “shunned” for it... sometimes that can completely change the trajectory of your life. 

On that day in 4th grade I gained not only a best friend, but also a newfound confidence. I still had (and somewhat still do have) social anxiety, but that was the first time I’d ever defied it in the name of helping another person. 

Just wanted to share since it’s 5am and I was thinking about Caden. We’ve since both moved out of our home towns. He to Texas and me to Indiana, but the physical distance doesn’t even feel like distance at all. He’s still my best friend and I don’t think that will ever change. 

I just texted him and told him I love him more than words can describe.

I seen people’s true characters come out and I also seen people’s personality just die due to altering the mind. 

My girlfriend, father, brother, and all my friends smoke from time to time. I went on vacation with all my friends and they all had to smoke before eating and then again after eating and I began to realized wow this is a pretty big part of my life that I’m always surrounded by it. Still to this day I’m not curious on trying it but I am curious on the hype of it. 

Does weed kill brain cells and lower IQs? It’s the first response from people who smoke weed that deny it does. I’m not saying it does but I have seen weed affect people in so many different ways and when I say oh weed kills brain cells, they all get offended and they me it doesn’t.

I never really fit in, so I gravitated to the nerd stuff. Anything that would take me away from reality. I grew up watching wrestling and I wanted to be a pro wrestler after I graduated high school so I just watched and learned and tried to get some confidence in myself. I was on anti-depressants as a teen and somehow managed to get a girlfriend. The plan was to go to SCAD and draw comics for a living but my girlfriend got pregnant and so I didnt move away for college, I just got a full-time job and worked. We got married in 2002 and I just worked labor jobs. Was never able to go to college to pursue my degree.   


In 2003, I met a guy who was an indy wrestler who was able to get me trained and I wrestled on the indy circuit for a few years. Still super bony and small.  In 2006 my brother asked me to sing in his band and so I did both for a few years. I won a few indy titles for nothing happening companies in front of 20 people but never really was able to excel. The band broke up and I started another one and even won a music award at the state level but at the end of the day, that band broke up too. 

Now I work in I.T for a company and have another band, but I feel like I'm just mediocre at best at fucking everything. I can draw, but only a little, I can write music and sing, but I'm just ok at it. I feel like I'm a decent actor given my wrestling ability but I dont know how to get into that field really.

78," This is a life lesson and story of mine which could also be titled as:

# How to be happy when you are not like most people around you

### TL;DR:

I am a 33 old person with more than ordinary love and passion for PC Gaming. It is what makes me happy, it is for what I am. I am also an IT Professional and I work for the IT industry. The computers are what my life is built around today. From my perspective, regarding gaming I've always been repressed in one way or another. I do not feel sorry for myself, I simply realized this and I decided to share the life lesson;

1. As a child I never had the computer I wanted, it was never good enough for the games I wanted;
2. I was allowed to play only 2-3 hours a day, else I was gonna be grounded for disobeying my parents;
3. If I had bad grades, I was being grounded again.
4. When I went to college I managed to somehow save just enough money to buy another PC Laptop that was again, strong enough to not play the games I wanted.
5. My family, friends, all of my past girlfriends, they all had issues with me gaming, their constant mocking and fighting almost made me believe that something is wrong with me. As a result I was always unhappy trying to make other people happy by trying to live up to their expectations about me.
6. My life started to improve better once I accepted myself as I am and once I started building my life around what I am, not around what other people wanted me to be/become for them.

Build your life around your desires and wishes and not around what most people around you except you to be, it is the only way to be happy and fulfilled.

\-----

I am 33 years old today. Ever since I was a child, all my life I wanted one f\*\*\*ing thing and only one thing there is that makes me happy. Playing PC games. (In reality there are three things, but for the sake of this text there is only one. The other two things came after. Gaming was the original love of mine that never went away).

When I was a child, my father bought my first computer. Before that we used to play on the old Comodore and Nintendo consoles. It was the time when we got introduced to PC games. Our first computer that we got however, was just strong enough so that it CAN NOT play the games that we really wanted to play. (To any grammar Nazis reading this, it is exactly how I intended to express myself with the previous sentence). It would still play older and simpler games, but not those 3D FPS/RTS games which were a trend at that time. To any gamers reading this post, I am talking about games like (Doom, RedAlert, DeltaForce, C&amp;C Generals, Elder Scrolls etc..). This was back in the late 90s and early 2000s.

A few years after once the technology moved on, we asked him for another computer, and we even told him exactly what we wanted. After a long year of begging for it he finally bought us a new computer, that again, lagged a few years behind the technology trends. The games that we wanted to play still had higher PC requirements. Despite this fact, we still played games on it, those which were able to play, and we played a lot.

I also feel the need to mention here that the reasoning behind my fathers choices of PC wasn’t that he didn’t have enough money or anything. He was buying us the PC which he thought would be good for us, but it was his choice not ours. In his head, he was unable to see a reason good enough to buy us a better and more expensive PC.

All of the above made my parents introduce playing limitations for me and my brother. We weren't allowed to play longer than 2-3 hours a day (I can't recall exactly how much time we were allowed), but for sure it wasn't enough. Every time we had a bad grade at school penalties followed at home and we were grounded, not being able to play at all. The internet (dial-up at that time was also sanctioned).

To counter the fact that our PC wasn't strong enough and the fact that we weren't allowed to play more than a few hours a day, we started going out in gaming cafes and wasting what little money we were given on playing the games that we wanted, for even less time than we were allowed at home. The rates in those cafes were expensive for us since we were children. Along that time our parents found out about this and, well guess again, they sanctioned it. First we were grounded for going out there, in their heads we were gambling or wasting our time while being irradiated by the monitors x-rays. ""Your eyes are going to spill out!"", as my mother used to say to us. Go and try to explain it to them that this is not gambling. Then after a while we managed to somehow explain so they allowed us to go there but with their permission only, which most of the time was ""No"" as you can probably guess by now.

One day while still as a child, I remember I just had enough of it so I've sworn an oath to myself:

**""Once I become an adult earning for myself, I am going to have the strongest and most expensive PC I could possibly buy, and I am going to play as much as I want and whenever I want""**

Little did I know at that time that this was actually going to become true.

Years went on, and I went to college. Once I finished high school somehow I was barely able to save \~500 euros to get myself a laptop for something to work on, I was going to an IT College after all. Again, this laptop just wasn't good enough. I mean in reality I never complained back then, It was the best PC that I ever had, I was quite happy with it, and it even had a separate NVIDIA graphics card. But hey, how much can you play games on a 500EUR laptop? It played casual games to kill boredom and nothing more. It played Dota and WoW on lower settings, yet I wanted to play the real games and with decent graphics settings, at least on Medium settings.

Then a few girlfriends came to my life who always had something to mock or complain regarding my passion for gaming. At first I struggled with this. I even developed like a sort of an anxiety constantly thinking that something is wrong with me. To better explain this, I'll name a few examples. 

So Friday comes and everyone wants to go out to party. I want to play DotA or WoW. Girlfriend wants to party, I want to play this new game I just bought on Steam. The result? I feel bad for rejecting them, they didn’t like me rejecting them, girlfriend is also unhappy. My roommates are having a party at home, everyone starts drinking. Ok I'll admit, this was fun, yes, but very often I didn't like this and I was angry for not being able to stay in my room in peace and quiet to play the game I want. The result? I feel bad for everybody asking me why I look like I am not having fun at the party. Well, maybe because I am not having fun. The worst of the parties were the nightclubs, for which by now I think I don't have to explain why.

So my last year in college was finally where I, well, where I probably started to accept for what I am and for what I like doing. ""I like to be able to game at peace as much as I want and as long as I want, and whatever game I want."" It was around then when I remembered my childhood oath. It all began by ditching the room mates in the final year of college and moving separately so that I can game and study at peace.

I graduated and I started working as a developer after college. Moving on for the next 2-3 years, I broke up with every new girlfriend that I found showing the behavior for disliking my passion for gaming. You see, I never had any problem with them doing their nails all day while sitting on the couch watching sex and the city or friends on FoxTV. I am not mocking them, I leave them be as they are, I love them and accept them as they are, but they have a problem with me playing games most of the day? (Rhetorical question, I do not expect a reply on this). I will admit though, breaking up with them wasn't easy for me either because I still loved them, it just wasn't going to work.

So to sum it up:

I am a person with more than ordinary love and passion for PC Gaming. It is what makes me happy, it is for what I am. I am also an IT Professional. The computers are what my life is built around today. From my perspective, regarding gaming I've always been repressed in one way or another.

1. As a child I never had the computer I wanted, it was never good enough for the games I wanted;
2. I was allowed to play only 2-3 hours a day, else I was gonna be grounded for disobeying my conservative parents;
3. If I had bad grades, I was being grounded again.
4. When I went to college I managed to somehow save just enough money to buy another PC Laptop that was again, strong enough to not play the games I wanted.
5. My family, friends, all of my past girlfriends, they all had issues with me gaming, their constant mocking and fighting almost made me believe that something is wrong with me. As a result I was always unhappy trying to make other people happy by trying to live up to their expectations about me.
6. My life started to improve better once I accepted myself as I am and once I started building my life around what I am, not around what other people wanted me to be/become for them.

Since the last 5-6 years or so I finally started to accept as I am, and guess what? Over the next few years my life just got better and better. I found a girl who never has any issues with my gaming passion and never has any issues for the way I am. She leaves me playing my games and she even encourages me to go and play if I bother her more then she is comfortable. I also leave her to read her books in peace, or to listen to her music for hours. This year she even started playing PlayStation so now we both play each in his own corner of the room. This girl is now the one who is my wife and the love of my life 6 years ever since we've met and 5 years happily married.

And what about my computer today? Well I never counted how much it costs as I only buy new parts when I need them. I never have a strong desire to always run the game on maximum graphics setting, usually High or even Medium is enough. As I work in IT I also use the same rig for setting up home labs when learning new technologies, so my home computer is much more than just a gaming platform, but it is something that my whole way of life is built upon.

For sure I could sum up at least 3000 euros on the whole rig in total, starting from the MB, the CPU, the RAM, GPU, monitor, a mechanical gaming keyboard, HOTAS for playing flight sims, a driving wheel with pedals, and all of that put together surely adds a lot to it. I know there are people who have much more expensive rigs then mine, again, I do not call myself a hard core gamer. I am just a guy with more than ordinary love and passion for gaming, and it is what I like to do most of my free time. I never stay on one game for too long like some people who play WoW or EveOnline all their life. I like to hop from one game to another just to return to an older game every now and then. I have a love for almost all types of games, from RTS, to race simulators, flight sims, RPG, FPS etc. It all depends on the mood.

If you somehow managed to get all the way till the end of this text, I sincerely thank you for the time spent on reading my life story. As for my message to any hard core gamers out there who may have developed social issues because of your passion or way of life, my message is ""Be modest in everything that you do, accept yourself first so that you can build your life around that, and not the other way around.""",24Apr2020,1

I have a group of friends that I do care about, but I realized all I do is get high with them.

I did this because I feel like I need a break from talking to them and social media to focus on myself and well being. Idk where to go with this friendship, and thought about slowly fading out. I’m 22 now and I feel like I need to start growing up and focusing on other things in my life instead of partying every weekend, getting high and wasting money.

However, our ""walks"" or ""meetings"" are always cut short because their boyfriends call them and tell them to meet them immediately. 

I really don't think that I'm attractive in any shape, form or meaning of the word. I'm not even in shape. The girls that I go out with are people who I've known since either kindergarten or primary school so we've known each other for a long time. There's really not that much attraction as there is friendship, nostalgia and catching up with everyone.

I recently started university and one of my female flatmates said that her boyfriend was scared of me. What does that even mean? There's also this girl from my class who I hang out with and she jokingly told me that her boyfriend thinks of me as her second boyfriend?? This is very confusing to me.

88,"Ive (23 f) been sitting on these thoughts for a couple weeks. Im almost 1 year postpartum and I didn't have the proper postpartum care due to living situations and insurance. I've always had really bad depression and anxiety. Paranoid about a lot of weird things ever since I was a child. Absolutely terrified of the dark, basements, taking baths when home alone, driving at night. These things effect me to this day but I try my best to ignore these feelings. But it all escalated after having my son May 2019. I truly thought Paranormal things were happening but as I tell my new doctor about my postpartum experience she's saying that I should have been hospitalized for psychosis. I understand to an extent. My anxiety and paranoia have been really making me feel like rare bad things are happening like house fires or people breaking in. Things that aren't actually happening but I'm absolutely convinced are sometimes. It's like my anxiety messes with my perception of reality. But on the other hand, I feel like paranomal things have happened all my life. Seeing things hearing things. Lights being turned on doors opening. Unexplainable happenings sometimes even witnessed by other people. Right after having my son I was having very vivid dreams and I couldn't tell if I was awake or not sometimes. Postpartum was almost an out-of-body experience for me. Although I'm still experiencing bad anxiety and paranoia, I've been working on it and have become a lot more logical to help myself get through it.
I meet with a new therapist 1 week from today and I'm really nervous. There are so many things that I need to get off my chest. Mental and emotional abuse as a child. Narcissistic mother. My father died when I was young. Sexual assult. I left home atb14 to live with a drug addict relative then I crossed the country at 17 years old alone to live with someone I met online who lied about their identity 100% then manipulated me to stay. Im married, have a nice appartment, and a beautiful little boy. But I'm still suffering. I think im a toxic person now using my defense mechanisms as if i was still in those situations and I'm not. I just want to be a better person. I'm so nervous.",24Apr2020,1
89,"I already posted this a few days ago but i messed things up because my account was new and i got confused, so my apologies for this. 

So, where do I start... About seven years ago, I met a girl in school. Let's call her Sarah. It was love on first sight. At least from my side. She friendzoned me and after about two years I finally got out and she became my girlfriend. For about three months. Then she dumped me. She changed the school and we lost contact. We were 15 back then.

Even though I never really got over her, I thought that I won't ever see her again anyway and kind of ""forgot"" her. Still, she was on my mind every day.

Two years passed by and I met another girl. Let's call her Mary. Mary and I got in a relationship real quick after meeting the first time and we still are since two years. Mary is perfect. I love every aspect about her and I didn't even think about Sarah that much, only from times to times it came to my mind.

So, heres where the real struggle begins. Last summer, coincidentally, I met Sarah again. She hit me up afterwards and we went for a coffee a week later. Since then, I can't get her out of my head anymore. We meet us from time to time and text sometimes. I always think about her, want to spend time with her and... I don't know man.

I am so confused. I have a perfect girlfriend, i love her, she makes me happy, everything is good. Whats the matter with me? Why am I still so attracted to her?

I didn't want to speak with my friends about it because I feel really uncomfortable. Even this post feels like I am cheating on her. it's eating me up rn.",24Apr2020,1
90,"To be honest, I just don't get how someone can rationalise voting for this person.

Today Trump said something so beyond  that I was taken aback to the strange feeling of surrealism I felt in 2016. I'm not American, but I was in the US at the time, studying and writing short articles for a magazine back home (New Zealand). Since New Zealanders, in my experience, were not drawn to Trump and mostly viewed his candidacy as cheap comedy, I was interested and wrote a lot about his supporters, interviewing some, attending meetings and even going to a rally. I felt that before the election, and even afterwards, I had a pretty good understanding on some of the (many divergent) major reasons people voted for him and why he won. I take nothing away from him- his speaking style at that rally was electric, and I really tried to communicate how idiosyncraticly masterful his speech was when people ask me about it.

I think since then its been easy, without my having noticed, to think I 'got' it. I see it a lot in other people too - you get this narrative that it was inevitable whether because of Hillary's flaws, partisanship, racism or sexism in the electorate, out of control neoliberalism, whatever. Personally, it reminds me of an old movie; Stranger than Fiction. After such an epic of a campaign, the ending could not have been merely a return to the status quo. I think everyone kind of really wanted to see what it would be like.

But seeing him as President actually does require people to rationalise that he is the best man for the job. Through most of his various scandals or media criticism (sometimes legitimate, other times exaggerated) I didn't question it. Criticism of his response to covid was fierce but its honestly difficult to say exactly what steps should be taken, on which exact day. I'm sure he would've faced criticism no matter what he did so on one level I can empathise with people that like him, and think CNN has it out for him. It's not like this decision is a nobrainer or a right/wrong.

But suggesting that doctors look into injecting bleach is just so tangibly stupid that I simply dont understand how he is still remotely in contention for reelection. More than that, it just seems like just kind of another funny Trump thing in the news. 

I dont get that. 

It just so obviously and viscerally demonstrates that this guy has no idea what hes talking about that I don't know how smart or even kind of dim people can think ' oh yeah this guy knows what's hes doing'. In a few months hes going to go out and defend his record on covid - how is a response of ""why would we trust a guy that suggests injecting people with bleach"" not the end of discussion? He so clearly has no idea on what hes talking about, how can people still think that this is the right person to be making these decisions. That suggestion, said so confidently, like his musings could cause some massive medical breakthrough.

It's nowhere near as morally outrageous as other things he's said (take the oil, you've got to get the families, when your famous you can just grab them by the pussy); it's not even the stupidest thing hes said (close, but ""can we nuke hurricanes?"" takes it for me). But its surely must tangibly demonstrate the connection between ignorance and dangerous public policy. People (including myself) may not naturally understand big policy calls, but we understand that injecting eachother with bleach isnt a solution. And, if we were going to muse about whatever popped into our head, we probably wouldn't do it in front of the whole world.

This isnt news, or some massive realisation, but it did remind me of those few days around election night. 

How the Democrats arent toasting eachother right now (Bernie or no Bernie) is beyond me. In any other context, it's over.

92,"hello, i hope everyone is doing well. 

i broke up with my ex almost 5 months ago and he has not left my head since. i spent the first 3 months in denial, sad, SAD, and unfortunately, extremely hopeful. it wasn’t until legit the day before school was announced canceled that i found out that my whole image and idea of him was completely opposite in my head vs the real thing. less than a month in he was already having sex with other girls and apparently had a girlfriend. i was thinking he was single and that there was still a chance but i was hella wrong. i also didn’t notice he went to school with fucking hickies lmaooo. i never looked at him for longer than 2 seconds so it was a huge shock to me. to be honest though i was so glad that i found out. my mind had been going crazy wondering what was up with the whole situation so i just wanted a straight up answer and closure. oh i didn’t mention but i was very hopeful because the times we talked after the breakup, he had left things kind of on a cliffhanger if that makes sense. it happened three times and it really fucked me up. without even wanting to, i was still attached. anyways he never left my thoughts. i could be listening to music, brushing my teeth, in class, walking to class, doing homework, cleaning, at the store, basically ANYWHERE DOING ANYTHING and i would think of him. to this day i’m still talking and thinking about him on the daily. my mom really liked him for some reason (jk i know the reason i’m just mad) so she brings him up quite a lot. she’s the main person i go to whenever i get in the break up process mood. however, i wish she’d actually listen when i say not to talk about it anymore but i guess i’m used to it already. 
 
anyways, i always think i’m over him but truth is i’m not. i’m definitely not as attached anymore or sad really, but i want to be completely over him. i just don’t know when that will be. i know time will tell and time heals all, but i’m getting very annoyed at this point. i also always wonder if the reason i still think about it as much as i do is because he’s thinking of me or some stupid shit like that. everyday is a new theory and i hate it. my mom tells me that she can see him coming to my house to talk to me and it’s something she really believes. my mom’s side of the family has this sick ass ability where they can lowkey  predict the future, it sounds crazy but i’ve seen it time and again. yeah so that keeps me up all the time. i really wished that she hadn’t told me that because whenever my dogs bark at the door, that thought always pops up in my head. it’s fucking embarrassing. ughh i just want closure dude! i never got to reflect and talk about how i felt. the times we spoke about the breakup, i always just had to listen to him say basically the same things. i understood he was hurt but he poured all the blame on me. i had some fault but he did too and he was just focusing on how i hurt him. but bro don’t you remember why i was the one to breakup with you? i don’t want to go into how the relationship was but it was pretty toxic. i don’t think i’d ever want to be with him again yet i’m still out here thinking about him. i try to stay logical and remind myself that he doesn’t care about me but there’s still that small part that thinks he does. i was dope ass girlfriend and i know i made him happy. ahh see!! i need to stay logical.

93,"I have been in such a funk lately, no interest in anything. I am a photographer and even that doesn't sound fun. I have always been excited by something, whether it be nature photography or going to my girlfriend's house. This is taking a serious toll on my close to perfect relationship with my girlfriend (29F). Her and I have been together for a bit over 5 months, and to say the times have been amazing would be an understatement. We kicked it off from the get go and it has been exciting and just a really amazing experience ever since. I truly feel at home with her, and she treats me with such love and compassion. I still live at home with my parents, and she lives by herself in her own house. I usually spend quite a lot of time there. I want to spend time there, with her. Being around her and with her made me feel alive. Out of the blue last week, I randomly felt little to no excitement about going to her house for the weekend. This has never happened before. I always was excited to go over and see her and spend time with her. I would think about cuddling and being in her presence all day Friday until it was time to go over. Last week, her selfies no longer made me feel butterflies or even any attraction. Reading texts about cuddling and kissing, and even sex, didn't turn me on. I find that it's not just her though. Porn doesn't turn me on. It feels like my sex drive has died completely out of nowhere. Her and I talked and we are going to spend a little time away from each other to let me try to figure my mind out. I have told her this is an internal problem of mine, and she did nothing wrong. I feel so wrong and mean thinking about how this has made her feel. From her perspective, we were doing so good. At the peak of our relationship. We have a trip to Iceland planned for less than 2 months from now. Then out of nowhere, I tell her I don't feel excited about anything and ask for space. I can't imagine how she is feeling and I feel like such an asshole for being honest with her that I do not understand these feelings.

When I go on social media, it feels like everyone has tons of friends. Everyone’s tagging each other in these challenges and memes under lockdown and I struggled to even think of 5 people who I’d actually tag in these things comfortably.

The silly thing is, I do have friends. My boyfriend (who I live with) and my cousin are my best friends who I speak to everyday. I have 2 close uni friends - 2 of us are bridesmaids for the other (we speak maybe once a week/once a fortnight). I then have a few other friends, a couple of work mates and ‘mates’ from shared friend groups (who feel more like acquaintances nowadays). I’d say only the first 4 feel like proper true friends who I’d feel comfortable calling if shit hit the fan - the others I feel pretty distant to in terms of friendship tbh.

I know deep down that this is completely normal, but I mentally beat myself up about how this isn’t good enough everyday. The trouble is... I have no close friends apart from my boyfriend where I live anymore. Everyone who I was close to moved away (or we grew apart).

I’m 27... which probably explains the problem a whole lot more. I guess the main point of this post is is that I want to understand more WHY I care so much. Hear from people who’ve been in the same position. It’s not normal to care to this level and I can’t figure out why it’s SO important to me.

Augmented Reality sounds like some concept used in a Science Fiction movie. Doesn’t it?

However, with the introduction of virtual reality concept and the launch of games like Pokemon Go, this concept has proved its existence in the actual world.

Augmented Reality (AR) is the future of mobile apps as it can be used not only in Gaming industry but also in every industry possible. A quick fact for you, it is being used right now in IKEA Place App (a furnishing App which uses AR to help you choose the best suitable furniture for your home).

**What is Augmented Reality?**

Augmented Reality is when a different reality is over-layed onto your pre-existing reality using certain devices such as smartphones and smart glasses. Computer generated images of a different setting are superimposed onto your device to alter your perspective reality. AR works in sync with other technologies such IoT (Internet of Things) and many others to give people a richer view on their reality.

**Difference between VR and AR?**

I hope you already know the difference, think of a VR headset (VR concept) and the Pokemon Go (AR concept).

To quickly brief you, VR (Virtual Reality) is basically when a person is totally submerged into a completely different reality than the one they are currently living in. Whereas with AR you can see  an **altered version** of your own reality on your **phone screen/smart-glasses** and still be in your present reality.

**SEO and AR: What to expect in future?**

Now let’s focus into the SEO aspects of Augmented Reality.

Till now, SEO marketers were focusing on improving the content of websites and their search rankings with the help of images, videos and info-graphics. Now with the success of Augmented Reality, this will be the new concept which will be a default feature in all websites in near future.

That is why, Google already is planning to make changes to improve Google Maps using Augmented Reality. This means Google may also release its next SEO algorithm update with the prior focus on Augmented Reality.

I've completely gone no-communication with my family (my mother being a raging narcissist is about as detailed as I'm going to get) which I'm okay with. I've been doing really well for myself. I moved 10 hours away and got a really good job that I was supposed to have for a minimum of three years. I'm making good money, doing really well in life. Christmas was a bit iffy because we actually thought we were going to lose funding (I work for a non-profit that is not gov't funded) and therefore I'd lose my job (but we knew it wasn't super likely so I didn't worry). 

Fast forward to just before COVID-19. I get word that we are actually losing significant funding which was a huge surprise to us and a major blow. My boss did the calculations and said he'd be able to keep me on until the end of summer, perhaps a bit longer depending on what other grants or loans he could find. But I was content with this. Nothing I could do to change it, I had to accept it, and it gave me about 6 months to figure out a game plan and save a bit of a contingency fund. COVID-19 was around but in the beginning stages. At this point, we'd assumed if it did reach Canada, it wouldn't be much worse than the SARS outbreak - after all, they're similar...

Well... here we are. I'm still losing my job in a few months, and the state of the economy and job market right now makes me feel super hopeless about finding another job sooner rather than later. I haven't been able to build up a contingency the way I'd hoped because I'm not working overtime (that was my plan and starting about mid-April, early May, we get REALLY busy and work a lot). 

On top of that, self-isolation has severely affected my mental health in a negative way. Just before shit hit the fan, I got into a really huge argument with a friend - whom I considered family - and she completely cut off contact with me, so I feel like I've lost even more of my family. I don't have many friends and only one friend where I live who is pregnant and therefore, I can't see her as much as I'd like too. I've never felt more alone in my life, never felt more lonely in my life, and never felt more isolated in my life which is really starting to take its toll. My work is turning into a joke because, as comms and PR (which ironically isn't even my background, it's history and education), not much can be done in the current state of things for my work, so I'm spending my days reading news, responding to a few emails about said news, and trying to come up with work-related things to plan after this all lifts, which is proving to be difficult because of so many uncertainties. 

I'm considering moving back to the States potentially, after the election, (I have dual citizenship) because I've looked extensively at the career markets here in Ontario to find next to nothing in my fields or interests or qualification range, so I figured that States might be okay to get my foot in the door, but again, given the state of things, it's looking gloomy. 

I have no one to really talk to right now, nowhere to go, nothing to do. I'm losing my job soon. I have no backup or rainy-day fund. No support systems. No clue what the fuck I'm doing, or what I'm going to do. 

I realize a lot of people are going through a lot worse currently, but I needed to rant. The internet is basically my only outlet currently. I just needed to vent.",24Apr2020,1
108,"Hello there! :)

I'm 22, 5ft7, study Economics at the London School of Economics (LSE), and live in central London.

As far as my personality is concerned, my female friends have always said that I'm quite cute, charming, loving and affectionate, so I'm hoping that's your cup of tea! I have always been quite sociable and popular throughout my life, but deep down, I am fairly shy and introverted. I'm quite fun and enjoyable to talk to, however, so I'm sure we'd get on just fine! :)

In terms of my interests, I thoroughly enjoy reading books on philosophy, history, and economics, as well as non-fiction and detective fiction. I also like travelling (lived in 9 different countries till date owing to my dad's job!), discussing politics, following all kinds of sport (especially cricket, football, tennis, chess and badminton), spending absolute hours on good old YouTube, doing loads of window-shopping (I've always had a habit of trying on *reeeally* nice clothes, but hardly ever purchasing them!), playing the piano, listening to a lot of music (primarily EDM, classical, and folk), going on lovely long walks, watching plenty of documentaries and films (mainly comedy and romance), cuddling, and so much more...

I enjoy trying out and doing a wide variety of things, so I can almost guarantee that I would have great fun doing a hobby of yours that is not mentioned in the list above! Just try me! ;)

On that note, thanks a lot for taking the time to read my post! I hope to hear from you soon :)

PS - I would be perfectly happy to share pictures of myself through a DM",24Apr2020,1
110,"The last straw was a few days ago. We are currently running on negative straws.

Many of top-tier officers continuously offend China, saying it's the ""Comunovirus"". There were multiple threats against democracy. The president himself advocates for the end of quarantine. He fired ""no, but actually yes"" the Minister of Health (aka the guy who was actually acting according to science).

And today, the Minister of Justice resigned, because he couldn't stand any more interference from the president.

As a context, the president fired basically the chief of FBI. WITHOUT the Minister of Justice's agreement. BUUUT the exoneration paper clearly stated the Minister of Justice's SIGNATURE. THE SIGNATURE WAS FAKED.

As another context, this is the same president that said to a woman that ""he wouldnt rape her because she didnt deserve it"".

This is for the blonde, skinny lady. The lady that shopped at Walmart, in South Jeresy. 

Today was my first day working ever. I barely slept at night, and I was nervous the entire day. They placed me with a cashier, and I helped her bagging groceries. My back was hurting and I felt dizzy due to the lights, but I needed this job to move out as soon as I could due to my home life. 

You tipped me today as well as the lady that helped me. I nearly cried, I’m still nearly crying right now. You said ‘let me buy your meal’ and at first I denied taking your hard earned money, but you kept insisting. Thank you so much for your 10 dollars. It made my day, the first thing I did when I got home was tell my boyfriend about you.I appreciate you doing that, and you in general. You will be remembered always to me. 

I hope you might see this sometime. Or even if you don’t, I hope someone who did a gesture like this reads this to know how appreciated they are. I also hope that if anyone reads this, even if it was $5 it would’ve made the world to me and I’m sure to most. Do gestures, even if you consider them small.

I'm sick of the same places, same people, same stuff to do.

116,"My nose was straight at like 14/15 but for some reason gradually became more crooked since then and developed a hump aswell and caused a lot of breathing issues and I was ill a lot as a result + always congested and a lot of mental and confidence issues. I’m 19 now and want a septorhinoplasty soon to try hopefully get my old nose back. 

I’ll list some potential things that could have caused it and if anyone has any thoughts on them I would appreciate it:

Being hit hard in face with ball when I was younger (think it was forehead tho + my nose was still straight then)

Wrestling fighting when younger (again it still was straight for lots of years after that)

Frequently Trimming/plucking nose hair like weekly.. this was around/right before the time my nose started to change, so maybe the lack of hair caused me to get ill more often or something and as a result mouth breathed more often which could’ve caused deviated septum? 

Dodgeball constantly around the age it changed like for an entire year because that was the only thing the new teacher could do with us. But I made sure to avoid being hit for this very reason because ppl threw it so hard. I can’t remember if I ever was hit in face but probably atleast once.. going to be so annoyed if that caused it after knowing in my gut it wasn’t worth/ fun being made to do. Tbh I think this is the most likely one. Should sue lol I literally remember constantly jokingly saying during It i don’t want to have to get a nose job and here I am..

Nose exercise things pressing it with my fingers around the time to try make it look slimmer.

Singing. This made me mouth breathe a lot and maybe the big amount I did when singing caused it to become deviated idk 

Dog. I recall just now once around the age it changed, he moved his head up really fast to bark and I swear he hit my nose as a result.. omg. However this could have been after it began to change.

Itching outside nose tip quite hard with my hand, maybe this shifted it or something.

Makeup, I remember hitting my nose pretty aggressively with a sponge lol, also maybe the particles got in my nose or something.

Swimming a lot a few years before it changed. Maybe the force diving caused it to shift but didn’t show signs until ages after. 


That’s like all of the things I can currently think of. I think the dodgeball or dog is probably most likely. Thoughts? I just hope it can be made straight again",24Apr2020,1

Backstory is I wasted most of my twenties on three associate's degrees because I kept changing majors.

121,"Confused about my current situation.

So, like idk how to start this or how to even type this out properly. I love a girl. It’s not just that I’m in love with her but I love her unconditionally. So we’ve got a complicated relationship. She says that she’s my best friend and by god I see her as one of the most significant people in my life. I don’t know man. I want to do nothing but hold and support her but mainly the latter. So we’ve. Made out and all that lately. I’ve been to her house to hang out with her and her brothers. I love her and her family so so much. She says that it’s easy to rekindle love or feeling for an old relationship but that’s she’s not ready for that kind of love. At the moment she’s talking or trying to talk to a girl and she wants to see where it goes. Truly a part of me kind of hurts but all aside. I want her to be happy and I want to truly support her and her family especially in these times of need. I hope maybe sometime in the future we could try again but at times I feel hopeless and as if maybe I’m actually just one of the most insignificant people in her life. I don’t know what to do but I’ve had people walk out of mine and I don’t and won’t walk out of hers or risk losing her. Even as a friend. Just. I don’t know how to handle all of this you know.",24Apr2020,1

127,"Complicated ‘friendship’ with my teacher

Before I start, we are both the same gender(females) so nothing weird here. She first taught me in grade 10. We got really close and on the last day of classes she asked me to find things to do together in the summer. We stayed in touch and went to the movies once. In grade 11 I wasn’t in her class but I visited her in break every once in a while &amp; we went out a couple of times. In the summer, she went radio silence unless I texted. In grade 12, I was back in her class. It was awkward for me because I thought of her more as friend. On her birthday that year, I arranged a surprise party for her with the class and got her a small gift with a note telling how how I loved her despite us growing apart. She responded by promising me never to grow apart, that she will always be there and that she loved me like her own kids, very close friends &amp; sister. We had lunch afterwards and she said she’d like that we do this more often. She would always check on me by texting or calling. However, by mid-year I was the only one initiating conversations and it really hurt me. I expressed how I felt to her (maybe not in the best way possible) through a long message, she said she felt lost &amp; confused and was really sorry I felt the way. And that she does truly love me and care about it. She said that love and hurt don’t go together and it seemed that she genuinely felt sorry. I waited for her to say or do anything for the following 2 weeks but nothing... she continued to treat me like a stranger at school. I was really hurt and couldn’t take it so I sent her another message telling her I wished we talked things out but i won’t disturb her if that’s what she wants. She told me we could meet up in an hour to talk. We met and she said she never got into such a ‘fight’ ever before and that she won’t take any more accusations. We cleared some misunderstandings on both sides. And she told me that I expected too much from her and that it’s best not to expect anything from anyone to avoid misunderstandings. She told me to ask her anything at the time and she won’t take any of my inquiries again. I asked her if she was okay with us being that close and she said I was impossible and that of course and relationships just happen. But I still felt distant and unfortunately hurt. So I tried to lower my expectations cause I feel like I’m just another student to her and she means more to me than I do to her.
Covid19 came and I didn’t think we would talk but surprisingly she texted to check on me and has been nicer to me. However, I don’t want to get attached to her and get hurt again cause it still hurts tbh and I don’t think I can take it anymore. Also, a week ago she was having a problem with my class and asked me to help and I was there for her and she she thanked me for it and said she loved me and referred to me as her daughter and it really hurt. I don’t want to get attached to her and I’m not completely over her either. So, what do you think? Is it possible that she loves me? Should I keep distance? If so, how come because it’s really hard for me",24Apr2020,1
