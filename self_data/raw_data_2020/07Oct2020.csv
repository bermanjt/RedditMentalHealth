1,Today i finally started to think i'm probably moving on just for something unreal to happen which got my hopes up for nothing. Why does this keep happening to me? Please stop fucking with me all the time.,07Oct2020,1
2,"Born in a third world country. Ever since i was a kid, my parents would never let me go out alone until i hit 18 which has wrecked me in every possible way.. i have no hobbies. I always feel lonely and i've really done nothing for all those 20 years that i've lived

My family is quite poor so i never knew what it felt like to have a phone until i was 17, i never enjoyed a single day in my life without having some dark thoughts creep in on me.

I have no goals and i'm never motivated to do anything and i've thought about ending it all a lot of times but having been brought up in a religious environment, i think i still fear the ""hell"" that awaits those who commit it.

I wish my life had meaning. Not to sound narcissistic but i don't want to die as just a number on the death toll, i don't want to live my life as an insignificant person.

I hope that one day, i wake up and feel like that i've truly made it. I want to reflect about my misery with a smile and think, ""I was such a dumb kid""",07Oct2020,1

4,"Trump's tweet about him blocking any stimulus until ""after he wins the election"" is SUCH a terrible political move, even the right wing subs are having trouble putting a spin on it r/conservative ended up deleting a thread full of conservatives lamenting that Trump had just thrown the election. The stock market plunged 600 points before closing, starting the second Trump made the tweet. Earlier today a top economist had released a report saying that without stimulus the US economy would be in serious danger and deflation could be imminent. The tweet is so bad politically it has me worried it's ACTUALLY meant to tank the US economy. Hear me out. There's several possibilities to explain the tweet, with my most serious concern last:

* Trump isn't a politician and made a huge but genuine blunder in taking credit for blocking stimulus and legitimately thinks this is a good political move. He might have thought making stimulus contingent on him being elected would help his chances, but in order for that to work he had to personally take responsibility as the one who controls whether we get stimulus or not. If he said the Dems were blocking the stimulus (better for optics) he couldn't also extort Americans by promising to pass stimulus after he won.

* He's experiencing the mental effects of the dexamethasone he's reported to be on, and not thinking clearly. Instead of realizing how much it'll hurt him to block stimulus, he's thinking this will extort people to vote for him. He genuinely doesn't realize how many Americans CAN'T wait another month or two for help.

* He's shorting the stock market, or helping others to. He sells his stocks early Monday while the market is at a high, then tweets that to tank the market. Then he buys back the stocks he sold and pockets the difference while technically not losing any assets. Then he reverses his position on stimulus and the stocks shoot up in value.

And the possibility I see as most concerning:

* **Everyone is realizing Trump will lose the election, including Putin. Knowing he's unlikely to get 4 more years of fuckery out of Trump, Putin's shifted gears and now wants to destroy the US as much as possible while Trump is still in office. A top economist says the US economy will tank without stimulus SOON, and Putin sends out immediate orders that Trump is to announce he's blocking all stimulus until he wins. When he doesn't win, he'll further block the stimulus, guaranteeing the US economy and citizens are hurt as much as possible before Biden becomes president. Trump promising to be the one to block the stimulus and ordering the GOP to lockstep ensures no one holds onto hope for the dems and reps to work it out. It also further tanks Trump's ability to win. The DHS says the largest terrorist threat in the US is white supremacists, who are passionate about Trump. We know Russia has been radicalizing the right. They continue to do so and stoke the idea of a civil war and voter fraud. When Trump loses the militarized right call foul (egged on by Trump himself) and explode in violence, attacking liberals and democratic areas. The liberals fight back and the US is plunged into civil war. Between civil war, a tanking economy, and a deflated dollar the US spirals down to a place from which it'll take decades to recover. It's a simple and fairly fool proof plan which does to the US what Putin says the US did to the USSR, which is his ultimate goal.**

Am I being crazy? We're getting down to zero hour in the election, and with it pretty much proven that Trump is 400 million in debt to the Russians and Russians interfering in the election and GOP, and with it becoming increasingly likely Trump will lose, I have a hard time believing Putin wouldn't pull out all the stops to do as much damage to the US as possible. His goal in meddling isn't to control the US but to destroy it. And if the economy is demolished, currency devalued, and citizenry killing each other... the US would be as destroyed as Russia could manage.",07Oct2020,1
5,"When I was younger, I couldn't be in the same room as a cat without sneezing and suffering itchy, wattery eyes. 

I've suspected I was over it for about a year or so as I can now stand near them without issue. Right now, though, I've been playing with my friend's gorgeous Russian blue kitty. She's purred at me, made biscuits and is now sleeping on my lap. No sniffles!  I've always been a dog person, but this little fluffball is making me think having a cat would be amazing.

7,"I've always had problems focusing on classwork. In grade school, I had problems turning homework in. I am scatterbrained. I get distracted easily. I have a hard time committing attention for hours at a time. It hasn't been a problem until now.

All of my coping mechanisms are related to physically having a place to work. When I show up to class, I silence my phone and put it away. I go to the library to complete assignments. I meet up with friends for study sessions; peer pressure keeps me on track. None of this is possible with online classes.

I can't concentrate when I'm watching a zoom call on my laptop. My drawing tabs are right there, and I'm incapable of ignoring them. It is not the same as sitting down at a desk to pay attention.

I've tried setting up systems of reminders. I've tried a planner. I've tried reorganizing my desk and computer. I'm weak-willed, so it doesn't help. I feel so weak for being unable to do it. My grades have taken such a nose dive.

It feels like everyone I know has adjusted just fine. Even worse, they complete their assignments faster than before, so I can't call them up just to study.

I'm really sad. I had been proud of myself for getting it together in university. I thought I reversed my grade school habits. Bad news: I'm still the same person, and I have all the same character flaws.",07Oct2020,1

13,"First of all yes, I already have a therapist (though she’s on vacation this week).

I was in eighth grade I believe. My family got a dog even though my mom and I didn’t really want one - fine. My dad and mom were fighting a lot verbally (my dad is very much dominant and my mom very much tries to shout him down but my dad usually gets the last word - not healthy). It got to the point I couldn’t take it anymore so I said something snarky about their marriage under my breath. My dad “attacked” me physically but basically we just clasped hands and had a mini pushing battle which I thought I held my own in (this part is important). I don’t remember anything else that happened afterwards like where he went or anything, but the only other thing I remember from that experience was right after, my mom told me that he would’ve beat me/that I wouldn’t have stood a chance in a real fight. I can only assume she was saying that to warn me not to try that again? Idk. But I think that’s contributed greatly to my sense of self in every sense being stunted emotionally, sexually, competitively, and intellectually.

I’m here trying to peel off all these defensive layers but it feels like so much. I want to *feel* in my chest again - I haven’t really felt that since 10th grade (breakup related). I feel nothing in my chest but fear and anxiety. I’ve spent the last month thinking I was probably gay because I notice guys more quickly than I do women, but I think that’s me looking out for the next person to beat me up or to feel threatened or insecure by. 

As I’m writing this I’m also realizing that I saw my dad’s dick when I was like 9 and (obviously) it was a lot bigger than mine. And I think I associated this with that fight - so especially as I got older I’d get more and more insecure about every component of sex to the point where I would get to the point of making plans to fuck someone and then cancel because all I needed was the approval of knowing they *would* without having to put myself out into a situation where I could get emotionally hurt (again).

Idk I have a long way to go. I just want to be ultra attracted to girls again, I want to be attracted to activities and learning and being with people again, I want to live the life I feel I missed out on for the last 10-13 years.",07Oct2020,1
16,"I'm 30 years old and I can't stop saying ""send forth all legions"" in a deep demon voice when I'm alone in my apartment.

For context, I got it from LotR when the Witch King guy is talking to his orc commander dude before the battle of Minas Tirith. But I haven't seen that movie in years. I've also been playing a lot of rts games lately.

My compulsive behaviour is usually settled with a good bag of potato chips. I get a bad case of munchies which triggers my compulsive tendencies. So I tend to sit here hurting for a bag of chips, repetitively saying ""Send forth all legions"" in a deep demon voice, playing rts games, and while fidgeting my legs like a mad man.

If you laughed, achievement accomplished, but I'm totally serious about this. I have no chips right now which is why I'm typing this. I'm also haphazardly hoping sharing this online will temporarily end this compulsive behaviour. It also has zero impact on my daily life. No one knows about it except you and maybe my neighbours.

17,"Man, I just wanted to write this out somewhere. Fuck covid-world amirite?

At the beginning of 2020 I was feeling my absolute best. In shape. Motivated. Really feeling good about my self. Now we’re in quarter 4 and I feel the exact opposite. I’ve gained nearly 15 pounds and my self-esteem has dropped. 

I know what I need to do to feel better. Exercise, diet, etc. but I feel like I’m in some mental loop where I’m self destructing. Feel bad about myself —&gt; acknowledge what I need to do —&gt; don’t do it —&gt; feel bad about myself —&gt;

I just need to find a way to be motivated again. I would love to lose 10 pounds by Christmas. But just talking about goals and writing this feels like it gives me the endorphins I need to put me back in this self destructive loop again.

21,"so i [18F] chose to move home from my college dorm after spending a month there, because my mental health was tanking. somehow i must’ve forgotten how depressing, and simultaneously anxiety inducing it is to be around my parents. my mom is the best person i know. like as far as parenting goes, she’s done everything correctly. my dad on the other hand is a stressed out maniac. 

when i was a kid, he was really stressed and had a lot of anxiety (which got passed down to me). i don’t know if him being a lawyer made him stressed, or something else (i think he has some kind of mental illness). anyways, when i was in middle school, he started smoking medical marijuana to calm down. and it was actually great. no more guessing as to what he would explode at next. but recently, he’s been more confrontational and rude. always interrupting my mom, ranting about his paralegal, etc etc.

now, im a pretty sensitive person, but i really thought i’d have more mental fortitude by now. my dad doesn’t even get mad at me (he’ll be upset about something benign, like his computer) and i just can’t help but burst into tears. does this mean i have some sort of childhood trauma that i locked away??? what is going on?? he once got mad about having to wear masks (typical boomer behavior) and i cried all night about it. 

to be fair, i know that i cry sometimes because i feel like my mom is trapped in her marriage. i know she’s afraid of him sometimes, since you never know what he’ll be mad at. but she doesn’t want to admit to me that she is. and from what i know about her dad, he had the same behaviors as mine. my mom even says she had to “walk on eggshells” around her dad, just like i do with mine. however.. why do i cry about this so often?? i still believe that i shouldn’t feel so emotional about this. 

there’s a lot more details to this but, i just want to get the main point across. any advice is appreciated.",07Oct2020,1

25,"So let me start by being clear what I really mean. I’m proposing that we take the actual day Saturday and do a swap with Wednesday. I don’t mean just swap the names of the days. I mean we actually swap the whole essence of the days. We don’t work on Saturday (now where Wednesday used to be) and we work on Wednesday (where Saturday used to be). 

Right now we essentially have all of our eggs in one basket. Our best 2 days of the week are consecutive days. But what if we spread out the fun throughout the week? In my opinion Tuesday is the worst day of the week but if we moved Saturday to Wednesday, we basically have another Friday. You’re trading having one Saturday night for having essentially 2 Friday nights. 

I’m not suggesting this is vastly superior to our current system, but I do feel like it could help with weekly burnout. Not to mention, when you order a package you wouldn’t have to wait and extra 2 non-business days for it to arrive, it would just be 1 no matter what day you order it on.",07Oct2020,1
26,"What I have to add (keep in mind these have worked for me, you don’t have to agree):

-Be on the same team, opposed to trying to outdo each other, argue to prove who’s “right”, or play devils advocate all the time.

-Use “I” instead of the accusatory “you” when discussing something that bothers regarding their behavior. (Ex: “I feel ____ when ____.” VS “You always _____.”

-Maintain a degree of politeness and manners with your partner. I know we want to be ourselves, but when it comes to the impolite, gross, or uncivilized parts, reign it in a little. (Ex: Going to the bathroom with the door open.)

-Verbalize appreciation/thankfulness all the time! Every time he opens the door for you? Say thank you. Every time she cooks you dinner? Tell her how much you appreciate it. Praise and appreciation should be shown regardless of how many times your partner has done X act for you.

-Take responsibility for your own feelings and emotions. Your partner can and should support you, but being your therapist all the time isn’t their job. It’s unfair to make them responsible for your happiness. Learn to take responsibility for the negative emotions you feel without leaning on your partner all the time. (CBT can help with this.)

-Apologize when you’re wrong. What’s more important, your ego, or your partner? 

-Refrain from name-calling and be mindful of what you say and do to your partner. You can’t take back any cruel word or actions. They will remember them.

32,"Ever get a random friend request from some fake model?  Most just delete it.  I look at their friends list.  Find some 60 year old, average dude, and click on his account.  Look at his friends list.  He will be ""friends"" with like 500 of these sexbot accounts.  These sexbots mostly post these links that look like a video, but it's a link to who knows what sort of staddy ass site.  The image looks like a porn video, which is why these idiots will click the image.  Anyway, these sexbots will sometimes have 1,000+ friends.  Think of all that time someone has put into running such an account  If the account doesn't have a cell phone number registered to it, and someone (me) reports the account as fake, FB suspends the account until the account holder sends in photo proof of their name and DOB.  If you can't confirm that name and DOB, you never get access back to the account.  Like 5 simple clicks from me will wipe out hours and hours of work that someone has done to build the fake account.  I enjoy my ever so slight attempt at cleaning up FB.


I went down this rabbit hole tonight.  No clue why some fake model sent me a friends request, but I went to a male friend of hers, and was given 741 accounts to pick from, easily 75% fake sexbots.  Every couple minutes I'll report one as fake.  I hit F5 5 minutes later and...

For this reason I've written off any sort of chance at a relationship due to me feeling like they'd end up settling for me and regretting it later down the road. 

Me and my best friend R are really close. I've helped them through some really dark times, they've helped me with mine. We just click really well, I've never meshed well with anyone like that before, and for that reason I was convinced I should leave my anti-dating bubble and give it a shot.

My now ex is getting flirty with one of my other good friends/crushes but I was happy for them, they knew I wasn't planning on dating any time soon and they wanted to pursue them. I helped them get together, I couldn't be happier for them.

I just don't see how to get out of this rut. I want to be back with the group, I want to be happy for them. But as soon as I'm with them I just shutdown emotionally and can't really even do anything. I'm just generally happier away from the group as of right now and I hate that.

38,"Hi, hello. I have depression and anxiety, and so does my partner of six years. Life has just been hard for us this year, like everyone. We are poor as fucking hell, living 100% paycheck to paycheck. I went to school and got my bachelors degree because I didn’t want to struggle like my parents have all my life, and yet here I am. I’m honestly worse off than my parents with the degree because now I’m $50k in debt and I’m not able to do shit with it until I go back to school for another $50k.

When one of us is in the thick of it, it’s hard for the other to not slip as well because we just feel hopeless. He stops talking to me, goes to bed at 6:30 pm, won’t eat anything. I don’t have anyone to talk to so my brain just eats itself.

44," 

Without getting into too many details, I (23M) was essentially in a situationship with a girl (22F) at the beginning of Covid. we never agreed we were dating, but by all aspects of our relationship during that time, we essentially were and it could be described as a regular short relationship. 

Our first time hanging out ended in a hookup. We met up at a bar and both got drunk, though I wasn’t as drunk as she was. At some point I felt fine enough to drive and offered her my couch to sleep on. We get to the house and i bring her blankets and a pillow. She gets all flirty with me and says “I don’t want to sleep on the couch I want to sleep in your bed.” And sex happened from there. 

After that day we were essentially a couple. I was always extremely sexually attracted to her, beyond what I knew I was capable of. We had a weird period where she didn’t want to have sex with me and I didn’t understand why, because previously she’d been very open about that happening and she wouldn’t talk about it. 

Over the course of our relationship I learned of some childhood sexual trauma she had and other abusive situations she’d been in with previous boyfriends. 

But I never heard her fully. She tried telling me that she had issues saying no to sex, that she’s always gone through with it for the guy because she felt it was an obligation for her, or she was scared of what would happen if she said no. 

Still I didn’t understand that she didn’t want to have sex with me. I tried talking to her about it and it would never end with her saying that she wasn’t open to the two of us having sex. I can recall many times where she did say no, and I stopped and nothing happened. I can also remember times when it felt like she was the one initiating the act. 

But I never fully stopped trying with her, even after we “broke up” I wouldn’t do it often, maybe like once a month. The last time I made a move was a few weeks ago, and that was a horrible act from me because she did say no and I didn’t get away from her immediately, I stayed and asked for something else before coming to my senses and leaving the room to calm down. 

There have been many instances when I’ve been in the wrong about making moves on her or pressuring her to do something for my own gain, when I knew that it was something she was probably uncomfortable with. 

I feel horrible about it. When her and I have spoken about it in the past I’ve been far too defensive about things. 

I realized this and that I shouldn’t ever try anything with her again after the recent incident and told her this. 

Today I saw her after work and again this topic of conversation came up and I said something defensive to her. Something that took the blame off of myself. Try as I must, I’ve always failed to not defend my own ego in these situations because I didn’t want to admit to myself that I’m actively hurting her here. 

Today after that conversation she left me some voice messages, saying that she doesn’t feel sexually safe around me because I’ve said things along the lines of me stopping before and I never did. And how every time we’ve talked about it I get defensive and she doesn’t feel heard. She's never felt like I’ve been apologetic or comforting to her about this (though in my mind I was trying) She had to leave them as voice messages because she didn’t feel safe saying them when I had the chance to reply

She’s recently found the strength to use bold explicit language to say these things to me, and they’re things I needed to hear. 

I feel horrible. I’ve always loved this girl, I’ve always felt confused about this whole situation and still do. It’s hard for me to admit to myself that I’m a predator but in this situation I am. I’ve never though of myself as a bad person and have never had any of the girls I’ve been with say anything like this to me before. 

She says she still wants to be my friend. 

I don’t know what to say to her. I sent her a couple of short messages. Just saying that I hear her and her message is valid and that I’m sorry. 

But an “I’m sorry” could never be enough to make her feel better for the damage I’ve caused. 

What do I do? Do I write her the longest apology letter I could possibly muster up? Is there even anything I could say to her that could make this better? I wish I could take all of her pain away. I know the things I’ve done are wrong. I love her dearly as a friend. I feel so horrible, please help. Any advice or opinions are welcome.",07Oct2020,1

46,"Long story short, I'm so depressed right now and have no clue how or what to do to make my life better. 

God I don't even know where to start...but if you read this whole thing you a real one...

So for context I am a 19 year old guy currently living in my parents basement. I am going to college for a bachelors degree in Business Marketing and will hopefully graduate next Spring. Only reason I can graduate so early is because I took a shit ton of college classes in HS for dual credit. Anyways, right now I am taking classes online (thx COVID). Basically the problem is that I have no life right now. I wake up, play video games,  work on school, play more video games, maybe go work at my shitty Subway job...aaannddd that's about it. I have almost no social life, only one person I would actually say is my friend and man I'm so thankful for him but even he and I aren't that close or hang out that often. The best thing I've got going for me is the gym. I started going consistently earlier this summer and I've fallen in love with it because its the only thing keeping me going at this point.

Some of the things I enjoy include Chess, video games (mainly Rocket League), hiking and exploring (I LOVE to go off trail), and just nature in general. Getting away to nature has been my savior lately. 

 I don't want to come off as some ungrateful prick who just likes to complain. Believe me when I say I understand how privileged I am to have a good supportive family and the opportunity to go to and finish college so early. I have many good things in my life. Not trying to sound arrogant but I am blessed to have ""above average"" intelligence (I'm no genius trust me). I've recently come to the realization that I can  become good at literally anything I put my mind to which is extremely empowering. The problem is not that I don't believe my life can and will get better. The problem is that *right now* it sucks ass and I struggle to find a reason to get up everyday. I have nothing to look forward to. Everyday is the same boring thing...school, video games, work, video games, gym, video games...with lots of getting high in between ;) 

My life is so empty right now and I don't know how to fill it. I just want some friends to hang out with. Maybe a squad of bros to get drunk with and mob around the city getting into trouble...

My social anxiety has crippled me. I am naturally more introverted and tend to be pretty quiet and reserved in social situations. Despite that there have been plenty of people who have tried to get to know me over the years but for some reason I push them all away. I like being alone...Im comfortable alone...but lately I've also been getting incredibly lonely...especially after I got my heart broken by a Tinder chick I dated recently for a few months...lesson learned...

I plan to move out once I graduate. I want to move far far away from the only city I've known and start a new life...but I don't even know what to do. I'm terrified of getting stuck in the 9-5 life in a job I ""kinda"" like. I want to find my passion but its always so elusive. The only thing I can say with confidence is that I want to travel. GOD I want to travel so bad...see the whole world, live on the road with nothing but a backpack and a dream. Problem is I feel like I am so wholly unprepared for such a venture that I've decided to put that on pause for a few years...at least until I can pay off my 17k of student debt. 

Anyways I'm rambling. Long story short,  I feel like I've exhausted every resource in this stupid city and I feel so restricted living with my loving but overprotective and *extremely* Christian parents. And on top of that, my life has 0 direction and I'm feeling very lost in life. 

I know this was very long and if you for some reason took the time to read it thank you. Any and all advice would be much appreciated. 

Stay safe y'all",07Oct2020,1

The other day I found out I won’t see her in person until March and it was a punch in the gut! I was on the verge of telling her that just being friends was becoming unbearable for me and we’d have to part ways even though I’d be heartbroken.

Then I came to my senses! I thought about all the joy she’d brought me! I thought about how brave I’d been when I first approached her a year ago; how happy our first conversation had made me; how she’s been nothing but a sweetheart ever since; and how much she enriches my life.

I thought about how my best asset is my sense of humour. And I’ve decided that from now on, whenever I have the urge to say something intense or heavy to her, I’m going to replace it with something light and funny that’ll benefit us both! No-one likes too much drama.

55,"so i am from a third world country and boy oh boy our internet connection is really slower than a sloth (not kidding). but the department of education still had the audacity to push online classes so here we are now. okay, now to my rant.

we have a new teacher that came from a public school and we thought she was really nice based on our first meeting with her. she was really sweet and soft-spoken. yeah, she WAS. this tuesday, we met her for the second time and we had to present our videos. because of the sloth-like internet connection of this country, some of my classmates could not present their videos so some decided to post it publicly on youtube and we, those who have faster internet connections, would just present them so that everything would go smoothly for our two-hour class. but halfway through the class, our teacher suddenly just ranted about how disappointed she was about the fact that the others did not present their own videos! also compared us to the other lower sections (we're the pilot section) and said they were better because atleast they tried to present their own works?! LIKE WTF WE WERE TRYING TO SAVE TIME FOR YOUR STUPID EGG FRESHNESS TEST PRESENTATION AND YOU HAD THE NERVE TO TELL US THAT BULLSHIT! but calmly, i chatted and told her that some of my classmates' connection were slow and my other classmate also told her that we're still not used in this kind of class bECAUSE WE REALLY ARE NOT. but then, this teacher told us that she was also not used to it and said the we were ALL still learning and started pointing it out to my other classmate. our group chat was going crazy, like CRAZY CRAZY. we let her pass, because we did not wanna fight a teacher. BUT WHEN IT WAS ONLY 5 MINUTES BEFORE HER CLASS WOULD END AND ALMOST HALF OF US HAD STILL NOT PRESENTED OUR WORKS, SHE STARTED BABBLING AGAIN ABOUT HOW SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT SHE WOULD DO TO THOSE STUDENTS WHO HAD NOT PRESENTED THEIR VIDEOS YET! WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK! THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE MADE THAT PLAN IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT YOU PROHIBITED US FROM DOING THAT AND NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT IT WAS OUR MISTAKE THAT MOST OF US HAD NOT PRESENTED THEIR VIDEOS YET! WHAT THE ACTUAL FUUUUCK.

56," 2 years ago, I tried to make a promise to God in order to force myself not do a tiring ocd compulsion. Ocd was telling me to return home in order to get some other, clean paper napkins. I did not want to do that so, I tried to make a promise to God about not returning home in order to get paper napkins. I cant remember what words I used exactly. It could be:

Someone makes a promise about not returning home in order to get paper napkins.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember that I was trying to be specific in order not make any mistake but I canceled the promise in the last moment. is it valid or not?

&amp;#x200B;

1 year ago, I left my aparment (which is different than the one I used to live when I tried to make the napkin promise) and ocd was telling me to return to my aparment, in order to get the garbage bags that needed to be thrown in a street dustbin because I may have made a rushed promise to God or to Gods.

&amp;#x200B;

 I returned to my aparment. I think, when I entered the kitchen, I noticed some other stuff that needed to be thrown out as part of the compulsion. So, I rushly started searching and picking anything that was garbage. I think, I searched almost, my whole apartment in order to make sure that I will keep the hypothetical promise. I left with the garbage bags and threw them into a dustbin.

&amp;#x200B;

 I started worrying that perhaps, one of the extra garbage that I was picking when I was searching my house, was paper napkins. Does that break the promise? I would like to remind you that I was staying in a different apartment when I tried to make the promise.

&amp;#x200B;

I did not return to my aparment to get paper napkins. I returned to get the garbage bags. I think, when I arrived in the kitchen, I decided to pick every extra trash that there was in my house as part of the compulsion. There is a chance, maybe that one of the extra trash were paper napkins that I put them with the rest of the trash into a garbage bag. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Did I broke the promise? The canceled promise maybe was about not returning home in order to get paper napkins. I returned home in order to get the garbage bags and probably, after arriving in the ktichen, I decided to pick every extra trash into the bags. I left with the garbage bags. Does that break the promise?",07Oct2020,1

But what if my information about rabies were wrong all these years, and i will get rabies and die??

Ik this wont happen cuz most likely my friends pet wont have rabies, and if im worried, i can tell my friend to observe it for 10 days, and the pet would most likely be fine after 10 days..

63,"So my (F26) birthday is later this month. I've been wanting to see a beautiful night sky for months. I used to live in Japan and would often take trips to the middle of nowhere just to see the sky. Because of the pandemic though, I had to return to my home country (for safety, family and better-medical-care-access reasons).

I told my friends 2 months in advance the dates I wanted to go away for the trip. It's a 5-hour drive away, and I've already booked accommodation (a house). The trip is now 3 weeks away, and one-by-one, all 4 friends have cancelled for legitimate reasons. 

It's hard not to take it personally, and I really do understand their reasons, but I'm so crushed. They've also never met each other, they're friends I met at different stages of my life.

I'm used to travelling alone and find it to be quite a healing experience. But for the last few years, living alone in a foreign country, I wanted to take a trip with the people whom I loved dearest. 

I've now cancelled the booking (free cancellation until the 20th), and booked a small room with a kitchen.

I've lost so much this year (I know so many people have), and I'm really heartbroken about this. I just wished some people would rally behind me when it was my special day.

70,"This is a bit of a long and story and it goes over the course of a few years but I'll try to keep it short.

When I was 18 going on 19 I had a friend that lived across the country from me. We talked quite on the phone and online. Eventually he introduced me to one of his friends and I started talking to her. We became friends and still are. A few months later I was snapping her and I guess one of her friends was with her at the time. She was me and thought I was cute so she gave her my snap then we started talking. After awhile things got flirty and we started to share explicit pictures. The ones she sent were pretty mild but explicit nonetheless. It wasn't until later that I found out that she was only 16 and I had mixed feelings about this. She told me it was fine because 16 is the age of consent in her state (mine being 18) but I still had a bad gut feeling.

Initially I blocked her but then she added me on insta and asked me why I unadded her. I felt bad about blocking her out of nowhere so I told her than it was an accident or something and added her back. Things would continue for a bit on and off after then we mostly just talked and occasionally explicit pics but I still felt really weird about the whole situation. Over the next few months I would block her and unblock her making excuses every time.

Eventually I apologized to her for everything that I did, the blocking and the explicit pictures. She said it was ok and it wasn't a big deal. So until recently I've just had her in my snapchat friends list not really talking to her. We occasionally replied to each others story and she wished me a happy birthday not that long ago.

It didn't really come up again until recently when I got onto the thought process of the worst thing I've ever done. This series of events popped into my head and have been haunting me for about a week now. I feel like an irredeemable piece of garbage. I feel like an idiot. How could I do something like that to someone. I am awful.

I got an urge to message her and apologize again but in the end I just ended up blocking her on everything. She probably won't even notice. I've been having mad anxiety lately and haven't been well even though nobody got hurt in the end and she forgave me. I still feel overwhelming amounts of guilt.

When this happened I was not in a good place in my life. My house burnt down so I was living in a small home until they could rebuild. I had a recent heartbreak and my sister attempted suicide. Mentally in a terrible place I went to look for unhealthy relief, with the main culprit being sex, going on tinder, and wanting to feel desired and liked.

This doesn't excuse what I did though. There is no excuse. What I did was overwhelmingly wrong and gross. I feel like a monster. I wish I could go back in time and make sure this never happened.

I've talked to one of my friends (the initial friend from earlier) and he says that I'm not a bad person and I just made a mistake and it's not a big deal. It didn't make me feel much better though. I'm going to talk to my therapist about it on Friday and I'm scared of what she'll think. Maybe she won't want to see me anymore.

86,"im not sure if this may make much sense to others because while im writing im listening to my favorite rapper which more or less makes me happier, yet i just feel empty. i just really have no idea why i dont manage my down days better, i've been at home since march due to our country essentially shutting down till next year because of the virus. some days i feel sad for no real reason or just overthink until i feel sad, usually telling myself to shut up helps but sometimes i just forget to do that. not to mention the fact that when my friends are sad that shit hurts, not terribly but i feel so helpless sometimes knowing the best i can do is message or call them given that we cant go out together or do anything together, i will never say this to any of them because i think its selfish of me to mention that when they're sad i dont feel at my best, especially considering the fact that they may not want to tell me how they feel thinking it'll hurt me which is the last thing i want because i'll do anything for them. like last night i was talking to my friend that was quite sad, they fell asleep on our call while we were listening to music and i just talked to myself for maybe half an hour, talking about how i feel sometimes, knowing that my friend was asleep really made me feel comfortable talking about myself pretending they could hear what i said, it more or less helped me get out emotions and feelings which i believe i repressed, im sure of this because it was so very hard for me to express myself. honestly, now that im done i realize that maybe i just needed to type this out to feel a bit better so thanks for reddit being a thing i guess",07Oct2020,1

89,"So, a little bit of background. I'm from a very, very rich family (not from the us). I'm white and so are my parent, and my grandparents and my grand grandparents ... Etc. We have been wealthy for generations, so you can imagine I had a certain feeling of entitledment about my status. 

Growing up, I had a lot of servants around me, and you guess, most of them were black. With time, I felt that was just natural and the servant role was just right for them because they were poor. We never treated them poorly or something, but I never considered them fully humans as well .... just that they were below us.

96,"I've had two dreams today, one last knight and one just a few minutes ago (I fell asleep before dinner lol) and both have involved the same sort of thing about my recently deceased dog at points. 

Dream 1 
See a sort of cartoon, chunky cat in the distance. Cat teleports over to me (now slender and average cat looking), morphs into my dog and starts throwing up and lies down, as if dying. I nor my parents who were with me in this dream, acknowledge it's my dog. We simply call out for help with this cat. 

Then just there I dreamt a cat walked over to me and morphed into the dog but I couldn't tell if it was a cat or dog. Mom comes over and says we got a cat with the almost exact same markings as our dog. As I pet it, it's fur comes out in huge chunks to reveal it's actually a tiny, white kitten. Weird.

I know it's likely just my brain doing it's thing, but what makes it weird is that it's been precisely 14 days since he's been put to sleep. And precisely 1 week after his death, my mother found a white feather in the foot thingy (where the pedals are lol). Apparently, white feathers are sometimes a sign from the dead that they're ok, and is even more special if found in somewhere like a car.

103,"This is no question. I'm not looking for advice. Just want to share my thoughts lately maybe it resonates with someone. 

I feel like i want to let go of love and the whole idea of marriage and romantic relationships as a whole. I dont mind staying by myself all my life. 

I prefer growing into who I am meant to become and explore all of my potential and talents.
 I feel like being in a relationship with someone kind of suppresses your fullest potential. I feel like it is more attractive standing on your own than to be dependant on this ""significant other"". 

Couples cringe me out. Let alone married couples. It puts me so off. Especially seeing all these wives desperate for their husbands attention, losing their self in their motherhood. Everything is always ""my children this my children that"". Women become so annoying when they become wives and then mothers and let alone stay at home wives. It's as if they lose their sense of purpose in this life. ( I am a female by the way). It just puts me so off. 

And then Married men acting like they are single flirting when their wives don't look. Man what is the point of all of this... People are just deceiving themselves into this idea of ""love"". What is ""love""? Must I have romantic feelings for someone before I ""love"" them? Is simply caring for someone not enough to say you love them. 

And I can deeply care for multiple people. All these ""love feelings"" are a scam anyway. I can have these feelings for a complete stranger and then again not feel that way about someone who is ready to give the world to me

 -so what is really the point of all this? U can fall in and out of love with multiple and multiple people.....there is no point in investing in that specific person when u probably can feel the same for someone else. It's all a scam to me.

105,"I wanted to make a post here as I have no one to talk to you. I feel pretty depressed right now and feel bottled up. It’s easier to just type sometimes. 

I’ve been sat in my car smoking weed for about 5 hours now because I don’t want to go home and see my family. I’ve become a lot more addicted to weed recently, it’s just what I do when I feel down now. 

I just feel so stressed and unhappy. I work a 9-5 , that pays decent money, but somehow I still haven’t learn to manage my money properly and make sure I have enough to last me. Since getting this car I feel way more broke, I have to drive to and from work and the petrol drains my bank. 

I normally spend my free time trying to squeeze what social life I have left in. It’s bitter sweet because I miss my friends and don’t get to meet up much nowadays (Some have got girlfriends that they’re always with etc) but then I neglect my own shit I gotta do. My bedrooms a mess. My diet is trash . Just that whole thing of not looking after yourself properly. 

The main reason I’m unhappy is because of my love life. I had to break it off with my ex of 9 months a month ago. The reason was because I kept feeling my love for her was wavering and falling apart. Since when I broke up with her, we didn’t speak for a few days then we started basically just sleeping together again and called it “fwb”. It felt like we were together again. I didn’t know how to act, so I just acted like everything was fine while we were together. But she still has really strong feelings for me. It really hurt her. The guilt really fucks me up, it plays on my conscience and makes me feel like a bad person. Yesterday we had a conversation over text and figured we won’t see each other for a while. I don’t want to hurt her anymore so I’m definitely doing her a favour by fucking off. 

The thought that I now have no one, no special person or anyone to talk about my day with, in my life makes me feel so shit. I don’t want be to alone This makes me want to talk to other girls because I’m lonely. I did start talking to this girl for a week and a half. I don’t know if my feelings are on steroids or something but I literally felt slightly attached as it was going well. But yesterday she cut me off because of her ex causing her pain apparently.

I think i need to find happiness in myself. I don’t know how to do that though. Not sure if this is the right sub for me venting.. I can say now I feel a bit better from writing all that ^",07Oct2020,1

108,"Sorry if this is long. A lot of events happened and only a few stick out so I am sorry if this is vague.

    For reference: In my family (mostly my two older brothers and I, can’t say about other family members) it’s like we have a tradition of being held back in preschool or kindergarten. I am no longer in school as I have graduated and I want to wait for this world crisis to be over before I start college. I am a 19 year old(almost 20) female. I was also born with Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum.


   Here’s the story: ever since I can remember school was not a nice place for me. I was in speech therapy(until 7th grade) and had an IEP (individual education plan) until the second half of sophomore year. My oldest brother and I have a habit of talking fast when we get excited. Even though I had physical seizures until I was two and a half, I had seizures going on in my brain until I was around 14 years old (you could tell if I was having one if you watched my eyes) and  I would act like I was totally fine, I would be bullied and harassed at school. The other kids wouldn’t invite over to a party or their houses at all except for 4 instances (one in preschool, one in middle school, and two in high school). 

   The bullying and harassment was so bad that my mom stopped believing me when ever I told what happened that day at school each day when I got home.

   One of the events I remember was in first grade, a kid was so angry at the fact that I went to another school with his friend that he would chase me every day (until 5th grade) and one day he caught up to me and karate chopped me in the back so hard it was painful. 
 
In 5th grade I gave my teacher a picture of a rose I had drawn (drawing, coloring, and writing stories are how I deal with stress) and a few minutes later I walked by the garbage bin and noticed the picture in the garbage. I didn’t say anything and that was the last time I drew a picture for a teacher. 

  Around this point my youngest brother was born and at first I was happy having a younger brother but now not so much as he would hit me (with toys and a lot of the times in the breast area) I would tell stop like 10 times until my dad would get him to stop. I stopped sleeping at their house and that behavior has stopped and I feel the safest when there is another visitor as my younger brother and sister go after them. 

   I moved schools so that my 6th grade year was at a different school and I still got bullied. 

    I have a loud and hard sneeze that can be sometimes mistaken for a yell and the first time I did it my 6th grade teacher yelled to be quiet. I raised my hand and told that I had actually sneezed. She apologized. 

   When I entered middle school I would mostly make friends with teachers that I liked and that was because I had trust issues with other students. I had 6 lockers in middle school (3 each year). At lunch when we could go outside I would hang out with one of the teachers watching the other students. At one point this kid was swinging his arms around and punched in the breast. 

    In high school the bullying and harassment stopped. In 9th grade I was in my math class and I stood up and the kid heading towards me didn’t stop and he stepped on my left big toe. The front of nail shattered up past the white part and my teacher told me I was in the wrong when I was the victim. two other students helped me walk down to the nurses office as it too painful to walk normally. The nurse put two band aids on my big two (one going vertically to cover the front and another going horizontally to cover the rest. During this whole thing I was crying in pain and for four months I had to have my two bandaged when it was summer vacation my mom took me to a nail salon to some how fix my toe nail, but it’s still messed up and you can tell because the right side edge of the nail is usually shorter than the rest of the nail. 

  During my senior year my entire art class liked to harass me and the art teacher who I have known since 8th grade because she was my art teacher back then as well. At one point a new kid who liked to target me and the art teacher threw a pencil at her and we were told to tell who did it otherwise we would be in trouble, so I told who did it and from that point that kid like to guilt trip me and I had to get silly putty just because of the class. Another time I sat down at a table and the other students sitting at the table moved away. I don’t smell bad as I was talking showers at night every day. My teacher had multiple talks and one of them was how I was not a super senior ( I think it was spread because of my age). My art teacher absolutely liked me and I think I was one of her favorite students. I told her about my brain condition and she was shocked by it and still accepted me. 

  In my art class I would usually bring my own color pencils and only let the only nice girl and my art teacher use them. When we did the paracord unit I wasn’t graded because my art teacher had already seen my paracord projects in 8th grade and all the way through 9-11th grade. It was nice because I got to help teach the unit and the other students had to look up to me instead of looking down to me for a change. 

    When the COVID-19 hit and school was shut down I was already used to being lonely and not hanging with my friends because it was like my whole life was that way except for the four instances or people. 

There are times where I can go from being happy to being sad the next.

I began to think about what the point of life is, what consciousness is, what existence is, etc. For the past month I have been waking up in a pure terror and experience terror until the moment I go to sleep. I spend most of the day googling existential philosophy, different religions, spiritual teachers, etc. I feel so much fear and anxiety that I can barely eat. It is the only thing I think about. I cannot enjoy anything that I used to enjoy because of the constant fear and anxiety. I feel like a switch has been flipped in my brain and now I am past the point of no return. I feel as though my entire life before this has been an illusion.

I am so confused, and I am experiencing intense depersonalization/derealization constantly. I cannot partake in any activity without thinking “why is this the way it is, this is absurd” and freaking out.

118,"In case you don’t know what synesthesia is, it means that numbers and letters (but more so numbers) have very distinct colors and personalities. For example, 5 is a fucking bitch and red as hell, and one is white and super boring and would probably not keep any of your secrets, but 7, oh god I love 7.

7 is the absolute perfect number, pastel yellow and white, so sweet, caring and interesting. I’ve always been very connected to the number. Sunday night I was staying at my friends house who is on his way to becoming a tattoo artist and has all the supplies, and since I’ve been wanting a tattoo for so long I asked him to tattoo me. I didn’t know what but then it hit me! 7!!! It’s right on my wrist and my little white self harm scar goes through it like the line in the 7. 

About halfway through the stick and poke tattoo we took a break and I figured I’d look up if there was any meaning behind the number seven and BOY was there ever. 

It is known as the “angel number” and is associated with completeness, connection to the universe, and spiritual wellness. I was absolutely shocked to say the least. Finding out after years of being obsessed with the number that it is so significant was eye opening. And incorporating my self harm scar made it even crazier.

With my scars I am still complete, I am not damaged, they are a sign that I have healed along with my body. I didn’t cover it up, but I gave the scar a new purpose, the line through the 7 :)",07Oct2020,1
119,":/ I didn't ask for this lol.


Can you imagine being able to commune with the dead and those who have never died, feeling their presence hearing their words their spiritual touch.


You honestly just get used to it.


I am just a typical weirdo or to someone a little more broad or creative the connection that holds this world to the next the Speaker of the lost, dead and ever was or were and spiritual-line between the realms.


I prefer the darker realms if I am honest, sure a mansion on a beach with beautiful minds and euphoria is good but I have always been naturally attracted to the dark side of life. When I explore I don't go out to a forest I don't know or drive down road i've never been down before, I don't take my dog and just walk I enter the realms alongside this one and then from those realms I push myself into realms so far distant .. They are so far away you cannot possibly comprehend it; that's not because space is large space has nothing to do with it.


This way of talking, being and living used to be a little intimidating but when someone dies and you tell yourself you'll talk with them only to realize that you have nothing to say to them when they were alive nevermind in death. Being able to admit to yourself and being born and dying are not that big of a deal is comforting. Certain things will happen to you when you die depending on how you lived your life it's not painful.


I'm not sure what pain would feel like in another realm actually, perhaps because I am never there permanently you would only feel true pain once you return.


I don't see or hear ghosts it's not like that; I don't actually believe in ghosts I think the idea is a little silly. Shamans who believe they are attuned to the earth -- i've honestly not met enough to make a full decision on it but from what I have met has taught me that they are probably, not, shamans.

I am just a weirdo -- a drifter.
