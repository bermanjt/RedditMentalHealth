1,"Example: The parents of a murderer, the brothers and sisters of a rapist, the friends of a pedophile.

I don't think they get talked about enough.  They are victims who don't get any sort of special treatment. 

I don't know what made me think of this, but it is what it is.  I feel terribly awful for the friends and family of awfully terrible people.",26Apr2020,1
2,"I’m not coping, I’m numb. I feel guilty because I’m not crying but I just feel numb inside. There’s moments where I will cry over something like seeing a dress of hers or something.

I was supposed to see her and say my goodbyes today, my mum and dad were going to be picking me up to take me to her.
On Friday my dad called me and told me that the nurse had been and we weren’t sure if she was going to make it till Sunday, 

My partner ended up driving me half way home to my sister who then drove me the rest of the way, when I got to my sister she had told me she passed away about 5 minutes ago, I couldn’t explain the feeling it was just awful. When I got there she was just laying there cold and stiff, I sat with her for 3 hours until the funeral home took her. I’ll never forget them taking her body I the bag and wheeling it away. 

She was my best friend but I know she was in pain. I know she’s cancer free and with her mum in heaven but I’m hurting. I can’t eat, I don’t want to do anything, my partner can’t come down because he knows I need my family but I also need him to. 

Why does this happen, I feel like I’m trapped and can’t breath, I’m sorry for the long post but I just needed to get it off my chest",26Apr2020,1

8,"Coronavirus has changed my life in ways I never in my life anticipated.  Six months ago I was working a great job in my desired career path while finishing up my college education.  I was happy, with a beautiful and wonderful girlfriend, a good income, a great home in the beautiful city of New Orleans, and a great life to put it plain and simple.  I was finishing school in December and was starting job apps for my next job, since my contract was also ending in December.  By the end of February, I had submitted job applications and cover letters to over 100 various employers across the United States.  I'd spent every day doing it, and had saved enough money from my previous job to live comfortably thru May on my current lease.  Then the first wave of responses came, about 10 companies, only one of which had opted to go advance me.  Within a week, they offered me a position, but it was at their location on the other side of the country, with a salary of $28,000 a year working 12 hour shifts 7 days a week.  Wasn't feasible in any way shape or form for me, so I declined.  Fast forward start of March, about 5 more companies had responded, one making me a tentative offer right in the range I wanted and in the city I was living in.  They said they'd circle back with a hopeful start date of May 1st.  I was so happy, it was exactly what I wanted.  Then things started happening.  The virus closed down everything.

Today, my life is nothing the same.

Today, I'm an unemployed recent college graduate with no job offers.  My last one had been pulled in light of the new situation.  My savings intended to last me thru May was evicerated as I was hit with a series of serious health issues over three weeks and had to cover my deductible.  I was forced to move to an old family home that hadn't been used actively in over two and a half decades, located in the middle of nowhere along the Alabama/Georgia border.  My girlfriend had to go elsewhere.  I've spent 6 weeks here with no outside contact other than the grocery trip here and there.  I'm almost out of money, insanely thankful there is at least a roof over my head.  I steadily get a stream of emails thru the weeks of decline notices from my job applications, at this point I just want to turn off my email its depressing to see.

Today, I am alone and scared of the future, and no clue what to do next.",26Apr2020,1
9,"I love mountains but I don't live near them. Last September I went on some hikes around Mount Baker. One of our hikes brought us to Lake Anne. Great hike by the way, ate lots of blueberries along the way. It was cold and misty though so no glacier views.

But the cold and the mist gave the lake a certain appeal. When the lake appeared on the horizon it just blended into the atmosphere, it felt like we had found the cliff at the edge of the world. But as the lake drew closer its surface was unveiled.

It drew me towards it. A very seductive lake, I wanted to be the lake. It was cool and I am an endotherm so hypothermia was a concern. So first I removed all clothing below the waist so that I could have them dry afterwards. And I entered the lake.

The lake was dangerously warm. It was asking me to get in further, but I resisted because I believed the lake was actually cooler than it felt. So I asked my friend to take a picture of me in the lake. But I wanted to show this photo to my coworkers so it was important that you could not tell my state of dress. The reflections on the lake helped to mask this.

Which made me wonder, even though you could not tell, would people be offended if they knew that in this photo I was naked from the waist down? So I made sure not to tell. But then I wondered, would people be offended if they knew that under my pants and underwear in any other photo, that I have anatomy? Of course not. So why is the lake any different? It is serving the same function. Are the lake my pants, if they fulfilling the same function? Do pants have to be solid? How big can pants be? If the pants have orders of magnitude more mass and volume than I, are they still pants?",26Apr2020,1
11,"I rarely write about my life on social media. I haven’t taken to Reddit for much, but I feel like sharing what has been on my mind as of lately- especially since the rise of this pandemic.

There is so much that I’d like to talk about since the beginning of 2020.

To begin, I saw my mother again who I hadn’t been in real contact with for the last several years (I live \~9 hr away from each parent). I took on a new career path; Automotive Sales, after one year of working with T-Mobile-- and nothing but kitchen-centered jobs before then. I’d planned for more upcoming performances with my band for 2020, with so much to discover and learn during that time.

Anyway, I’ve thought about a lot of crap during the COVID-19 outbreak.

I’m writing for a number of reasons, and there are so many different views and thoughts I have on the life I have been living as of late, and of course what is going on with our planet-- from my perspective.

I had not posted on social media for so long. From what I was told by everyone, I had been doing pretty well at working my position: the sole BDC (Business Development Center) representative at a car dealership. There was training in place to become a full-on Sales Rep on the floor.. I had not even thought about something like this for my future as a career. Before I had even realized, I had found myself required to work everyday to work this department- just to make sure everything went smoothly.

Months before the announcement of COVID-19 I had decided that I needed to see my family, so I spoke with both parents and planned to meet up in Vermont during mid March.

My week-long “vacation” occurred between March 13-19 (yes, I drove up Friday the 13th) and for its entirety, the idea of the Coronavirus striking the world became a mainstream threat.

During this week, I saw my father and his girlfriend together a few weeks before their final break up (absolutely necessary!) and my mother who I had not had a constant relationship with since I left her in 2010.. She even tattooed me, for the second time. I had interesting and insightful moments with my partner- the entire experience was insane.. AND lastly, trying to contact my job to make sure things were going well with a customer, getting the right information he had requested while I was out.

I had never made a sale before since I’d never been told to do so, but I had gotten a deposit over the phone (first time!) for this specific customer. Let me tell you… communication was absolutely horrendous from my dealership to myself.

Thursday the 19th, the GM texted me to make sure I was coming in for work the next day, Friday the 20th-- and told me that I had nothing to worry about regarding the COVID-19 outbreak. He said we were working business as usual, even though I’d asked him if I could stay home to work since I felt more comfortable there. Apparently the ‘higher ups’ didn’t want people working from home, and I decided to go forth and question it.

That same day upon going home, I anonymously called the HR rep for my company and asked what we were planning to do among the outbreak with my concerns of people coming in and being able to stay safe along with how I am to make a living. They ended up getting what City and position I was working out of, explaining that we are going to be open, and that the company just cannot allow working from home.

That Saturday after being told to stay until close if I could; I was told \*RIGHT BEFORE CLOSE\* that the “higher ups” had gotten rid of the BDC department due to lack in business and a cloudy future for the company. They needed to let go of someone in the Sales department (they have 5 people now, I was technically Sales) and they chose to let go of my position due to tenure.

My employers told me if they were opening up a dealership on their own, I was coming along. That it wasn’t them, it was the company…

So listen…

This is the FIRST TIME I am getting paid as much as I am, and I am completely unemployed-- sitting around on anti-depressants thinking about what the F\*CK is going to happen with our future, and how insane the present is..

Damn, this is the first time I feel like I’ve written in a diary in basically 15 years.

I find it completely insane that I’m able to get this money by doing jack SH\*\*; and for a DECADE before sales I was working my A\*S OFF in kitchens, making the least I have \*EVER\* made in my life!

I cannot believe this is the situation we are all in for 2020...

For all of you who were given furlough or were promised to work again; I am not guaranteed a job after this, and I have absolutely no idea what I am going to do career-wise.

THIS WHOLE THING IS SUCH A DOUBLE-EDGED F-ING SWORD, BECAUSE I FINALLY FEEL AFTER THIS LONG A\*S GRIND-- THAT I AM ABLE TO REMEMBER MYSELF

Quarantining has had me thinking more openly than I had in forever; expressing parts of my creative self that I have pressed away for far too long.. Ugh.. I’d rather vlog about that crap…

AHH! In conclusion, the points of this post are that if you are feeling similar, if not the same-- You are not alone!!! If you are reading this and in a different position, I hope you allowed my words to touch you and allow your eyes to be open, if they aren’t already. To anyone who doesn’t give a sh\*\* and has a job after this is over, well f you. To anyone who doesn’t give a sh\*\* and is also f-ed, f you too, my friend.",26Apr2020,1

21,"My boyfriend is hanging out with his friend tonight at his house. I told him that might not be a good idea considering this pandemic and his friend is traveling back and forth between families. He seemed a bit insulted that I sort of implied his friend could be sick. Every time I tell him he needs to act like the risk is everywhere, he says “my friend is not sick. I know he isn’t.” But no one really knows unless they get tested, and the friend did not get tested. I probably should’ve stopped arguing when I realized he would continue saying the same phrase “friend is not sick” over and over again, but eventually my bf just said “stop treating me like a child.” Then he got mad that I was texting him and distracting him from hanging out with his friend. I gave up after he said that. Maybe he’s right? It’s ok if it’s just one friend he’s hanging out with? 


Im still frustrated as hell, partly from him but also partly a built up frustration from everything going on. Everyday I see articles that people aren’t treating this like a pandemic.

My close friends and family always tell me that they think I’m some amazing person.

My parents tell me they wish they were more like me. I just can’t get myself to believe what they’re saying, that I could be someone important or amazing in the lives of others, despite how hard I try to help others. 

I guess it just comes down to self esteem, I don’t really know. 

I’ve spent near all my time helping my friends and family in whatever ways I can, usually emotionally, through the rough times that have come.

32,"I have had several long-term relationships throughout my life. I have never been one to use specific “sexual type” terminology mostly due to my lack of knowledge, but I recently learned that the way I am is called “demi-sexual” (for those who do not know what this is, it means that I have never been interested in meaningless sex or one night stands, in other words, I am only interested in sex/intimacy when I have very strong feelings for someone). So each of my relationships have been exclusive, very romantic, and full of deep passion and love. I have never considered myself to have a “type” except for the fact that every one I have ever found myself falling for seemed to have a darkness in them, not evil, more like a depression, a negative outlook on the world, and usually had a terrible experience growing up if not a full blown traumatic upbringing that caused them to have very low self esteem as an adult. My friends started telling me that I have “broken bird syndrome” meaning that I date people that I want to “save”. I have always been a hopeless romantic and have always enjoyed helping others. My favourite thing in the world is animals and I work doing rescue and rehabilitation for dogs. My previous job was working in a rehab for men where I loved helping humans. 

The idea that I could “save” somebody through loving them and showing them that the world is a good place was so tantalizing to me and when I was a teenager I used to have fantasies about how I would meet my future husband this way. For example (this is embarrassing), I remember imagining the same thing many times while driving in the back of the car with my parents; I would picture finding a man hurt at the side of the road with no one to help him, no family or friends, and he had basically given up on life. I would find him, take him home, and nurse him back to health and we would fall in love and live happily ever after. As an adult, the realistic version of this was meeting someone who had been intensely bullied their whole life, another boyfriend I had spent most of his childhood in group homes, was abused, in a gang for a while, and had substance abuse issues. Another boyfriend was a severe alcoholic. My current boyfriend is a recovered opiate addict. 

What I want to say about having “broken bird syndrome” is that it is not at all that romantic fantasy I had in my head that I would save someone with love and then live happily ever after. I actually used to take it really personally when loving someone wasn’t enough to make them no longer depressed. At this point in my life, I understand that depression is a lot deeper and more serious than something that love can just make go away. People who are depressed need to make a strong and serious effort to beat it. They have to make this decision and cannot be forced into it. They often will require the help of a therapist, possibly anti-depressants, a lifestyle change, alter their eating habits, the introduction of routine into their daily life, self denial and a strong effort to build up their self discipline which in turn will develop their self esteem. It was juvenile for me to think that just becoming someone’s girlfriend would make them all better. It’s actually a little bit narcissistic too but mostly just naive. 

The person that I am with today is my most serious and longest relationship. I don’t ever consider leaving him and I hope he would never leave me. He is the first person that I have ever moved in with and we have a really great home and on paper, a really great life. He started a business one year ago, risking everything he had at the time and being unsure if it would be successful. He was broke when I met him and I paid for everything (something that has occurred in almost every one of my relationships). His business took off and he has become more successful and wealthy than he ever imagined he would become. Another moral of this story could be that money does not buy happiness! 

He has children from a previous relationship and because of that fact, when we decided to buy our first house and move in together, it had to be in his neck of the woods which was too far away for me to continue working at my job (dog sanctuary) so he invited me to quit my job and work from home doing any form of rescue that I’d like to. Since his business has been doing so well, he no longer has to go in more than a day or two each week. So we are essentially both at home, all the time, with no place to be and few responsibilities beyond caring for our pets and looking after our home. 

I keep myself busy walking the dogs, tapping trees and making maple syrup, visiting my parents who happen to live close by, running errands, cleaning, reading, and doing some other hobbies that I enjoy. My boyfriend spends almost all of his time watching TV. He watches so much TV that he often gets in a pretty bad, frustrated mood just from the fact that he has seen everything and can’t find anything to watch. I encourage him to come for walks with me, join me for errands, help collect sap for making maple syrup, visit my family or his family, or even just to toss a ball around outside—but he says no to all of those things and anything else that I ask him to do with me. He is almost always in a bad mood and he has a seriously low level of patience. He gets frustrated easily and then his bad mood worsens. He isn’t abusive or anything, he is a very sweet guy and I love him to death. But he can tend to snap at me and be a little mean sometimes when he’s just in a really bad mood. He has done a couple things—just a couple—that were really hurtful to me. One of them caused me to leave and go to my parents’ for five days. Both of these occurrences were resolved and both boiled down to him crying and telling me he is very depressed which was his root cause of why he did what he did.

I knew that he had depression issues when I met him, being a recently recovered opiate addict. I also saw how he looked at me and how he was falling in love with me. I was so sure that together we would be nothing but happy and that he would never have to be depressed again. But that wasn’t the case. 

The advice that I want to give is that depression is a really terrible disease. I have struggled with depression as well. As you can imagine, one of my relationships with someone who was severely damaged was abusive, mostly mentally, and his actions caused me to lose my positive, cheery personality and become very depressed myself. I spent almost an entire year in bed, isolating, and thinking terrible thoughts. No person could have made that depression go away. I ignored my parents’ and others’ advice for that whole year before finally making the choice to fight back at my depression and to work hard at getting happy and healthy again. It took a ton of hard work with many setbacks, but I didn’t give up. I had to try several different things before finding what worked for me. Today, I don’t consider myself to be completely free of depression but I still read books on improving myself, I still seek and follow advice, and I am constantly working hard to change my life for the better and to never stop striving to be a better, happier, healthier person. I had to hit my own rock bottom before I was able to truly make the choice to get better. 

I have been trying so hard to encourage my boyfriend to work at fighting off his depression but it is almost as if he doesn’t want to. I feel very lonely on his worst days when he is just incapable of laughing at my jokes, has no appetite, has outbursts shouting and swearing over the smallest things (such as a tool breaking or tripping over something—nothing to do with me but I still have to listen to it), or sleeps all day. Sometimes his negativity rubs off and I feel my own depression creeping in. But mostly, it breaks my heart to see someone I love suffering and I feel helpless and unable to make him feel all better. 

I will never give up on him, I will always keep trying to encourage him to come for a walk, to talk to someone, to eat a healthier diet, etc. But I want other people that have “broken bird syndrome” to understand how difficult it is to be in a relationship with someone who is severely depressed. Your love may make them very happy. In the beginning it may seem like you’ve “fixed” them, but depression is a disease and love simply isn’t the cure. It’s not that your love isn’t ENOUGH. It isn’t that YOU aren’t enough. It’s like trying to give someone someone Tylenol for COVID19 and then feeling hurt when it doesn’t work. If you want to commit to someone that is suffering from depression, please educate yourself on what depression really is. 

Most importantly, if you believe that you might be someone who seeks out “broken birds” or people who seem to be damaged and you think that your love can save them, please take your time getting to know them and make sure that if you enter into a relationship with them, it is because you truly care for THEM and not solely because you want someone to “fix”. 

If you have any questions about what I’ve said, please PM me. I will be happy to answer/offer advice. 

IF YOU ARE SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION: Please reach out to a friend or even to me. I could write a whole book on my experiences with depression and I have had some seriously dark, dark days. I know how it feels to have zero hope and I truly believe that the reason I am here to write this post today is because of my dog. There were days so painful hat I wanted to just end my life in order to stop the pain, but I couldn’t stand the thought of my dog being confused at why I wouldn’t wake up and then missing me forever. I know that sounds terribly selfish—many people ask “what about your parents? What about your friends?” And my response to that is that when I started to have the idea of suicide cross my mind, my parents and my friends WERE enough to shake the thought, but the more you have that thought cross your mind, the deeper the pain gets, the more lonely, the more hopeless, less and less thoughts are able to ease your mind and chase away that terrible thought. So when it came down to it, it was my dog’s droopy, jowly, drool-y face looking at me with overflowing love in his eyes that made me break down and realize that there’s no way I could ever do it—I am glad that I didn’t do it because no matter how depressed I ever become, I KNOW that it can always get better. If you feel utterly depressed and like there is just no hope of ever being happy, ask yourself if you know for a fact that you will still feel this way in a year, two years, five years, 10 years and so on. SO much can happen in just six months let alone five - 10 years. The odds are, you will not still feel the way you feel today in that amount of time. Don’t you want to see how it feels to be happy? Ecstatic? Elated? In love? All of these things ARE in your future, so don’t rob yourself of the chance to experience them because of how you feel today. 
If you want someone to talk to, I would love to talk or even just to listen. 


TL:DR - If you want to save broken birds, focus on finding and saving actual birds with feathers because no human that suffers from depression and/or similar mental illness can be saved simply by love. Being in a relationship with someone that is suffering from those things is a very difficult and exhausting experience. There may be no end to their suffering and you could be in for a life long journey full of many difficult days. If you get to know someone that is depressed, and you truly care for them, then it would be very selfless and admirable to stick it out with them and do everything you can to help which will mostly mean encouraging them to seek help. If, on the other hand, you are ONLY drawn to someone BECAUSE of their depression/dark side, it may cause more harm to them because if you don’t truly care for who they are as a person, you will likely leave when the going gets tough.",26Apr2020,1

I watched p0rn intentionally for the first time when I turned 18, I remembered it last November or so and I was bored that one night. Since I was the legal age, I figured, why don't I finally go on some NSFW subs and see what I've been missing out on. And honestly, it's one experience I'll never forget.

But after that one night (I didn't return to those subs until a month later) I've noticed I was starting to loose sexual attraction in general. Once I filled my curiosity on what a nude woman and intercourse looked like, I began to loose interest. (I don't have an addiction, I probably only visit those subs once a month, and even then I don't get aroused) I then just stopped caring entirely and forgot about it shortly after the quarantine began. I just don't have much of a sexual attraction, and when I did, it was only due to curiosity, not something I that I actually want to take part in.

In all honesty, I was never really into sex in the first place, I think I only wanted it because of peer pressure, the fear of being left out, but whenever I was exposed to it, it just felt weird, cringy, and dissatisfying, I always feel the need to avert my eyes whenever a sex scene showed up whenever my mom was watching NETFLIX or some random fan art pops up on my screen. Even today when I scroll down some NSFW p0rn subreddit, I often try to look away from the images and I would have a cringy feeling in me (in fact that was me today). I'm only on there to study the images to help influence my artwork, I'm not actually getting aroused by it.

Maybe I'm asexual or I just happen to be immune to the effects of p0rn.

So it seems like the only time I come to credit is when I feeling like outer trash. In the last 48 hours have been rough and before that as well but it was minor before then.

Ok so for the past three weeks or so I have been refusing to eat much, just what I need to survive. I would skip breakfast sometimes. I don't know why I am doing this. But I am a very skinny person. I am often compared to a twig by people who claim to be my friends

These people that claim to be my friends have also been ignoring me for the past two weeks. They would not respond to any of my messages. I don't spam them or anything. One day I would ask them how is their day going after maybe two days without a response I would try sending a meme then after no response after a further two days I would try something else.

My former best friend thinks that I am annoying and that's all I am. I don't have a personality beyond that. But I wouldn't deny I am annoying in school most of the time but that's the role that I was given by my peers. The annoying, dumb kid. I just want to be accepted so that's why I don't dispute the role. I am not the most social person.

So that's the basically the few that I think of friends I have mighty low standards in that department. I am regularly called stupid by many in classes constantly, also I am not the most healthy person. It seems i have gotten all the bad genes in the family I have serval health conditions but as a result I am always tired and pushing myself to attend all my classes. In the past year, I have only missed 10 classes at most. Consider that from 30 classes that I missed in the previous year. But sometimes it's too much for me and I fall asleep in the middle of the classes , I am normally at the back so I don't disturb the class. But a teacher has started picking on me as a result of this and he encourages the jokes that students make about it. I am not okay with this but I can't do anything, this particular teacher is a dean so I can't make any reports against him and he is generally well-liked by the rest of the class.

But school is its own problem just needed to get that one off my chest that's not my current issue, as it no school as we all are in lockdown.

Ok so my current issue, as you can surmise I am lonely and have no one to talk to, the one person that could talk to me and not see an annoying, stupid person is currently vex with me because as they put it I am to damage. I don't know what to think if that is what the only person that was okay with me thinks about me.

My family is better that I had none, I have a sister she doesn't have my interest in mind unless she can use me. I literally will do anything that I can to help her. She is more boyish in nature than me. So when she wants someone to exercise with I am there, when she wants someone to talk to I am there. But when I need someone she is never there and could care less.

My mom isn't any better, she is always on her phone or sleeping but when she isn't she is with my sister or stepdad. Lately, my sister and mom have taken to watching movies together but I can't go with them because my stepdad is there. Also when I asked my mom to do the same thing with me a while back she was to busy and didn't have time for my non-sense.

My stepdad doesn't like me at all. He hates my guts and everything that I do is a problem for him and he constantly complains about me to my mom. Who gets mad at me for being me.

Today I finally caved in and cried because it was all too much for me, well I didn't exactly cry I shredded a tear a single tear, I have become distant from my emotions and cant properly connect with them. So in all, I am feeling lonely and I have no one to talk to.

You guys are total strangers but if any of you want to hear about my best story that happened on April 2nd ( i know it a day after April fools but that when I made my dumbest decision yet ) I would be happy to tell you guys. Just need someone to talk",26Apr2020,1

42,"Feel free to ask more details but I'll probably keep this brief for now. As the title says. I (21F) broke up with my partner (22M) of just less than two years. This was for a multitude of reasons including me going overseas soon for study, us both being very passionate people and wanting to go different places with life goals and general unhappiness and several other minor issues.

While I didn't blame any of our problems on him, he placed a lot of blame on himself post breakup. I moved on quickly (potentially having 'checked out' of the relationship before it was officially over) and have since slept with other people. I'm definitely happier outside of the relationship and have learnt many things about myself since. However, its clear that he fell harder for me than reciprocated and stated (post-breakup) that he had planned to propose later this year (I would have declined, but that's not the intention).

He has since blocked me on all social media, likely to his benefit as he could see that I was moving on and us still talking, albeit occasionally, was to his detriment. I still wish to stay in contact with him but am rapidly realising that he's probably chosen the best option by cutting me out.

Anyway, so it comes down to me realising that I've not necessarily ~ messed up ~ but more been the bad person pre and post breakup. I'm guilty of hurting him and realised since that my communication skills were (and are still) shocking. I never brought up issues and rather waited for him to realise something was wrong. We talked often about his feelings but little about mine. This led (especially in the latter parts of the relationship) to him feeling as though I was just drifting away from him for no reason and leaving him behind, confused as to why I wasn't happy. Since I'd already somewhat shut the door on us continuing to date several weeks before we were officially over, he was then exposed to me moving on quickly. While I'm not persay 'sorry' for my actions - they've taught me plenty one of the main things being I'm not ready for a long term commitment at this point in my life, and definitely not before I've learned to more confidently communicate - I do regret hurting him and being the primary cause for a lot of pain. 

How do I come to terms with this? I am well aware that I've changed someone for life in a negative way and he had trust issues before me. I'm not asking for forgiveness, potentially just similar experiences or ideas to move forward?

Tl;dr: I'm the idiot in a previous relationship who caused many of our issues through lack of communication. How do I (or do I never?) come to terms with screwing someone up who I still care about (albeit more platonically).",26Apr2020,1

My dad was korean american and was an Iraq War Veteran and he would tell me stories about how fucked up it was and he really suffered both physically and mentally from it. He was a nice guy but he had a pretty bad temper.

It was in New mexico and I was in third grade and my dad and i went to walmart to get food and look at some new toys. Once we bought everything i was in the car and my dad was loading everything in the trunk and a police officer comes and starts to harass him. At first my dad was calm until the officer started to ask for ID. My dad refused because he didnt really have a reason to. Shit escalated and then the officer said something the lines of ""you see this uniform? you will obey my orders or you will be detained for obstructing an officer"" and my dad said how he wont because he didnt commit a crime. I remember that what got my dad really pissed was that the officer had his hand on his weapon and my dad just said ""what youre gonna shoot me? you've probably never even taken a life have you? I respect that youre serving to protect rights, but so did i but in a dry fucking desert"" and my dad closed the trunk to show the officer his ""Veteran"" license plate and i guess the officer backed off from there. the rest is not much to tell, just my dad telling him he shouldnt be doing shit like that.

Now, last night I received an Instagram DM from a stranger. This person sent a paragraph and needless to say I was confused, this stranger is my brother. Apparently my biological mom is now married and he is the oldest child out of three with her current husband. According to him, she had mentioned that he had an older brother, but she didn’t know where he was now. (That’s me!! Obviously.) Since then he has been sort of searching for me, they didn’t know if my first name had been changed, if I was still in the same state, etc. Over quarantine he had kicked the search up a notch, they found my name and from there found my social media. We talked and he’s 19 and I have two younger sisters who are 16 and 14. Him and I are planning to meet up for lunch when quarantine ends, we only live a 45 minutes drive from each other. While I am excited this is absolutely terrifying. I guess the end goal is to meet and possibly have a relationship with my biological mother and sisters? But that’s even scarier. Mainly meeting my biological mom, because I held a lot of anger towards her for a long time. It’s difficult to describe the kind of thing’s you think and feel when under those circumstances.

At the start of it all I drafted a list of things I could do to stay busy, things I ""never had time for"", things I wanted to dedicate myself more to but hadn't. And, as it turns out, wouldn't.

Most of the quarantine has just been me replaying old favorites among my RPG collection and binging Star Trek and other series. I'd hoped to get back into writing stories more, get a good practice schedule for piano, tear through some books, do art projects- you get the picture.

My day consists of waking up, going to work, working, coming home, and watching Youtube videos. Unless it is the weekend, in which case it consists of doing my parent's chores for a bit. Then watching youtube videos.

The recent lockdown, has not bothered me one bit. Why would it bother me, that I can't go outside, when I already never did, apart from work?

I tell you. I have never seen someone who lived a life as void of frivolities as mine. Even incels have friends, or go out sometimes. My life is the blandest one I have ever seen. And it is not for a lack of searching. I have simply never seen any depictions, or recountings, of a life similar to mine. It just seems that I am the most passive living being on the planet.

It even applies to “positive” things, like an older male coworker saying “ooooh why are you smiling like that? I bet you have a new boyfriend.” Etc. It’s creepy and unnecessary.

I tried to live on my own in my dad's second house at 21. Three floors is still a dump and always will be (accepted my bedroom) started to do all the opposite stuff of what I love. Like read books that are so dull that I am not into. Started to go crazy but I was always back and fourth from my parents. I was too young to be living on my own. Tried to get my sister to live with me as they where giving her no freedom and being tight on money. (And parents live in a 500k house with nothing to show inside). Fearing they would ruin her childhood as they did to mine But that didn't work.

Instead I did go to live and work in London but that's a whole another story.

I have lived with people before in a dump in a house share, monthly rent. I was a mess as I could never feel like I could think or read and just wanted to sleep all the time. But I felt like I was alive with all my emotions. But I kept flipping back and fourth from that house to my parents.

My mum wanted me to comeback eventually I did as I only signed up for 3 months. So I lived in my parents house again. Not really realizing how depressed and dumb I was living with my insane mum and I don't know what father was.

After that I was so delusional that I didn't think I was smart and I decide to go to college for a year while living at home. Just now I have done a year at university but I didn't like it. I was so depressed. But was glad to be away from them both. I have a trade that I can always fall back into. Going to Uni and trying it made me realise more how fucked up my world is.

I have now recently moved back in with my Dad in the second house. As he and mum now live in separate houses (won't file for divorce, live a fake life). And the Pandemic was just beginning.

I wake up always on edge from living with my dad but I can think and I read daily. Listen to music, cooked food, watch anime. I am able to suppress my emotions. I don't like living with my Dad but it is the smartest move as I hardly pay rent £120 instead of £400 housesharing.

My dad is a bully. Tried to bully me at 10 but it didn't work but it turned me emo and fragile at school. My dad still lives in a depressed world constantly talking watching football, referring or coaching. His life evolves around football. He is like he is looking into the Erised mirror still trying to be that pro football player. (I hate Harry Potter even though I am so knowledgeable on it). and there is nothing I can change about that.

I see a lot of darkness, death and delusionals in my mind. This does not help from my insane mother she is a Karen and as a teenager she was an alcoholic, had to fight with her because I didn't know what was right or wrong. Dad telling me to kick her out of the house. Every week was different from which parents side I take do I listen to my dad do I listen to my mum.
This was around time my parents was still caring for... but they where able to keep that all hush hush and fake it and the caring for... they never saw or got involved as it was a big 3 floor house and they slept and played on the top floor. Caring for... got more then I did but my mum was a good caring for... when she was sober. I never got a penny in my teenage years.

Still scares the living crap out of me being round her to this day. I hid a lot to be like other people, play video games, try and be friends with people that I don't have a connection with. I honestly feel like I have been so suppressed and brain washed from my parents in my teenage years.

It hurts me to say that. Never the less what I am saying here. Does not help that I am in safe isolation with the Pandemic going on. I feel like I have gone of topic a bit here as probably starting to lose it in lock down.

Basically I am staying at home smartly to save money. I could even buy a house maybe get a dog in the countryside in 2 years but then I don't know if I will lose it. Not sure where to go next in life.
I have around 30k now but I spent 10k stupidly over the past 2 years. If you have read all that thanks for taking the time to read it.

90,"Theres this problem I have. So, basically I love animals and we have 2 pets. they are both young cats. Tis information about my cats may be useful later. So, I am here to ask, id theres something wrong with me.  Whenever I do something dangerous or stupid (like, really stupid) I want to do it again and again and each time go further or make it more dangerous. I also noticed that sometimes, I'm completely conscious and I know what I'm doing but I still do it even if its a very bad thing. For example, (please don't kill me for this i couldn't control it even if i tried) I took this string and tied it onto some rubber snake toy, and I was playing with my cats, then, I accidentally hit one of them with it, but then I did it again on purpose, and again, and again. Sometimes even really hard. Something like that happened today too, and thats why I'm here. This is what happened today: I took a pillow and started hitting them with it, playfully. But then, i hit them harder, and they tried to hide. But I kept going. After I tried my hardest to stop, and it worked, I instantly started crying, I went to my cats and fed them, pet them, and said sorry 10+ times. I'm so sorry Coco and Oreo. But I can't control my stupid ass. My question is, what the fuck is wrong with me?",26Apr2020,1

92,"Ok, so I  have been curious why I keep dreaming about my ex boyfriend so I thought I might get some insight about this on here. First a little background on both of us. We were together for only 4 month in HS, but it was very passionate and fast. He was a sophomore and I a junior and it was a good relationship till the day that he broke up with me. We never talked about it, but I suffer from depression and other stuff I later got diagnosed with ( dont want to get too into that) anyways so sometimes I would just shut down like at the end of class ( we were both in ROTC) we all hanged out back in our ROTC classroom and I wouldn't talk to anyone and just listen to music. I guess people noticed, but I would just say it's nothing and say it's fine. Anyways so he couldn't understand or didn't want to deal with me closing off or not being completely open with him. So he broke up with me. I took it hard, but in school I acted completely different (numb) so I was good at seeming like it didn't bother me. 
 
We had a talk that same night when I dialed him up, but i still was closed off. 

Anyways so we never got to be friends againnafter, we just delt with being around each other around school. We were both officers so we had to be professional I guess you can say, and we were both in the same class and same platoon. Anyways we were both Myspace  and then Facebook and Instagram friends years later, but we never once messaged each other. I ended up deleting all social media ( besides YouTube) after years of having it cuz it was boring and lots of drama. 

So to the issue every so often I dream about my ex. It is never ever sexual in anyways. It's always like one of us wants to get back with each other. Like we reunite some way are around our group of friends or just each other. The dream goes no where and it just ends. Like even though in the dream one of us or both wants to be with each other we don't end up together or whatever, it just end like that. My thing is it's been 12 years since HS and 13 since we were together, so why am I having dreams about him when we don't have anything to do with each other nor do I think about him any other time of day at all? I'd like to think that if we were to have been together longer and well I wasn't dealing with stuff and I had given himself the second chance he was trying to get some time after we broke up ( rumor was he wanted to get back together, I never did anything to get back with him) we would have been together, but that's the past. We haven't seen or talked in years and I dont care to. I have no longer feeling for him and I am with the father of my children and have been together for 10 years this April. 

So why do I keep having dreams about this guy who I have no connection to other than been with him years ago? I have a life and he has his, but it's like my mind brings this up for some reason. I feel a little weirded out every time I wake up and realize i had a dream about him again. Has anyone else experienced this?",26Apr2020,1

96,"I was diagnosed Bipolar when I finally decided to see a psychiatrist this year, being on mood stabilizers helped me see thru traumatic episodes of last year clearly. My father is a bipolar-schizophrenic so growing up wasn’t simple either. I always have avoided his reality amidst my society of friends pretending I just have a normal life.
I go to a different city, became part of a new society, where I used to get high often which I believe had its effect on my condition to make me vulnerable &amp; prone to my own delusions.
I am in a way “emotionally hacked” when this new person shares their traumatic/made up stories which make me form a bond with them and I for once finally open up whats buried within me about my father and my past life and my relationships. I entrust them with my emotions and they start to study me.
I trust them enough to follow their leads in illicit activities involving drugs, maybe let them use my mobile/computer devices to play music, which they in turn use to access my personal data, cloud backups and who knows what else.
Next thing I know, stuff is getting stolen from my apartment and I’m getting spammed with fake account requests and messages on my social media profiles, I believe for blackmailing.
I left that town for good and cut all the wrong people, still ignoring if any new spam reaches me, been clean all 2020, meditating and exercising everyday, being mindful in the present and trying my best to not be devoured from regretful memories or consequential expectations of suffering.

Yet here I’m incorrigible :
1. Delusion of persecution - where I believe something still is out there wanting to cause me harm. Holding a strong desire to quit social media but worried my fake identity can be created to cause social damage. I have lost the ability to trust new people amongst a certain few cities or social groups.
2. Delusion of reference - where I believe my society(not my close friends) have a certain opinion of me, or a certain bias, or discussions, or some knowledge of my episodes that I do not know of. I had always ignored any rumours of me before the episode but now they can be triggering.

I’m proud with how far I’ve come in this battle with my own self along the genetic possibility of ending up absolutely crazy like my father, I’m learning to love life.

Many nights, before going home, I made love to her in the solace of my car. Her cold kisses were intoxicating. I knew my family wouldn’t be happy to know how frequently we were together now. From the moment I met her, I knew she was dangerous. She promised to take my hurt away. She did for a while. But when we embraced, I did not notice the knife she was twisting into me. I began needing her often. To be happy. To have a great time. I needed her voice crooning in my ears to fall asleep. My liver hurts. I can not sleep tonight. I’ve taken my dose of sleeping pills. I do not need her singing anymore. Her kisses are no longer sweet to me. But the sun has risen and the pills didn’t work. They say alcoholism is a silent killer.

I’m not on that mood at all I realised. Specially after joint their “WhatsApp” group they’re all so very boring and not my style of people!

104,"As I (43F) grow in maturity I think more to myself, if were to die next week, would I feel happy? The answer is a definite yes! I mean this in a really good way. I feel like I have managed to get my life in order and achieve what is meaningful and important in life for me. Sure, I still have some beautiful goals and dreams yet to achieve (and am right on track for them) but overall I am good to go! 

I suppose I have thought more about mortality as I get older and a few friends have died and one friend in particular that I went to high school with has Stage 4 Cancer and has limited time left with her husband and children. It has really made me think and appreciate much more all the good things I have in my life. It also confirms my view in life that anything is within the rhealm of possibility and life is entirely unpredictable. My friend may only have a few years to live, but so may I. 

I believe in fate and  random events that can instantaneously change our lives. We will never see these moments coming, you cannot predict life and everything truly is uncertain. I love this! In the past this idea of chaos and random events filled me with nihilism and effected my enjoyment and engagement in life. I used to think, what's the point!! I have now transformed my mentality to embrace uncertainty and therefore the possibility and potential that each day brings.

Tomorrow is never promised, and I see this as a thrilling and exciting idea. I can live each day pretty much like it could be my last. I have read about concepts of impermanence in different mystical traditions and really life is transient and brief. I am going to enjoy my time on this earth!

When I was in the United States Marine Corps I was stationed in an artillery unit in Camp Pendleton. 

During during boot camp we’re taught the Geneva conventions (internationals laws of war) 
and they told us that after Vietnam it became illegal to use incendiaries such as napalm or white phosphorus during a war. 

It’s important to note that we’re taught to train how we fight. 

Months passed. 

I completed my training and got stationed in an artillery unit in Camp Pendleton, California. 

The year was 2015 and my CO was giving us one of his famous speeches about he we need to be frugal cause the marine corps is broke but we can still afford to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on artillery rounds and constant field operations cause ya know... 

Train to fight.

Even in peace time or “garrison” as we call it. 

I didn’t question this at the time, as that is one of the main things your taught as well - “instant willing obedience to orders”. 

So he’s giving us this speech and I’m a pfc that’s totally surprised by this, like damn we’re spending the cost of a house to blow up hillsides for target practice. 

So naturally, after the briefing I inquire to my corporal about the cost of our howitzer and mortar rounds and he’s like yeah we waste a fuckwad of money on dumb shit and we also use white phosphorus which is expensive as fuck. 

And even though the conventions do prohibit the use of incendiaries, which white phosphorus is, the United States said fuck that protocol we’re not abiding by that but we’ll follow the other rules tho. 

He went all moto and said that’s why other countries shouldn’t fuck with us and that was that.

I can't really motivate myself to do anything if other people don't pressure me. In fact i'm writing this laying on my side cause i can't even focus my willpower to get up. Theres so much to do, i need to prepare for finals, write some emails and do some assignments but all i can really get myself to do is nothing and listening to music. I'm still doing some hobbies but it's not enjoyable, still better than what i'm dealing with when i'm alone with my thoughts.

It's not even what bugs me the most. People count on me to help them with school related stuff and others just wanna text with me. Last week someone asked me how i am and it took me 5 hours to reply that i'm alright cause i just wasn't sure what to say. Another friend got some lgbt stuff going on and i really want to support him but i'm afraid i'll drag him down because of my mood. A classmate whos really putting effort in his assignments asked me to help him with something. Now he really did alot for me already so i jumped right in but just didn't know what to do. He figured things out himself and was not even mad. How could i let this happen again?!

It's a weird feeling, i know exacly what to do to feel better. Eat an apple, get on my bike and text a friend. However the best i can do is lying on my sofa an crying for an hour straight. Everything else seems so hard, it feels like i don't even want to be better. I just wanna eat, sleep and cry for the rest of my existance.

I could ask friends or even family for help but they've got theyr own shit going and i really don't want to force them to be my psychologists. I don't wanna tell anyone who knows me that i wake up every day wishing i could just never leave my bed again, that i think about suicide when i'm listening to music, that doing things i used to love feel like unseasoned chicken or that thinking about the things i have to do snowballs into crying uncontrolably because to me it seems like i'm failing everyone.

Now i could find a professional but i don't wanna to do this during the pandemic since there are people whos problems are far worse right now. Further i probably won't get an appointment in time for my finals.

134,"I’m a 27 guy, I live on my own, with roommates, have a decent job, and friends, but I always feel like something is missing. 

When I date and when I start to feel something, I end up ruining things, thinking I’m doing something wrong, try to better myself, and they lose interest and leave.

Everyone of them who left say, you deserve more, someone who is 100% with you, but the more and more I date, it seems like no one is 100% with me. The girl who most revelry did this said, you have to accept yourself more, and that stuck with me.

She said you don’t seem like you enjoy where you’re at, and I can’t help you with that.

I always thought I accepted myself, but I’m starting to think maybe not. I always think I’m not good enough for anyone, and I just think to myself”why are they with me” “I’m a boring person, why would anyone want to be with me”

I just lost the girl I thought I had the best connection with in years and I’m tired of thinking I’m not good enough for anyone. It certainly feels like I’m not, and I’m tired of being on my own. It’s been over 6years since I’ve had a real relationship, I want to feel again.",26Apr2020,1
137,"I'm posting this solely for the reason that I need to either talk about my emotions (which I can't to people I'm closest to, I'll get to that) or write them out to process them. This post will get buried, that's why I'm not using a backup account. Parts of the story may jump around, bare with me. And last, I would prefer if you're going to say something rude or mean, just don't please. I'm vulnerable, I don't know where else to go or get this out.

My (I'm 23F) depression is hitting me so hard right now. I feel like I am overwhelmed with my life. I have struggled with depression in the past, as I am diagnosed as clinically depressed. I am starting to notice it creep back into my daily activities. I think this is stemming from a couple different things. What I'm hoping is is that these are Nicotine withdrawals (I stopped vaping cold turkey.. different story). But I also can't help feeling so lonely.

This is the part of the story that has been affecting me the most. I recently have gotten in a new relationship with my girlfriend (20F). She is amazing, I am falling really hard for her and vice versa, and not to mention that my parents like her. Another thing is that I have a twin (obvi 23F) sister and she is not supportive of my new relationship. I want to make a point of how close my sister and I are. She is literally my other half, my best friend. I would die for her. But she will hardly talk to me anymore, and she hasn't mentioned or congratulated me on my new relationship yet. It's like she pretends it doesn't exist.  It's not because she's homophobic. In fact, she is very supportive of the LGBT community and rights. But she does not like my girlfriend, despite not meeting her yet. I can't say that I entirely blame her, because the reason my twin doesn't like my girlfriend is because she found out that my girlfriend and I had done some coke together (I do not need a lecture on this). My girlfriend is not an addict, and she doesn't do it all the time. I am also a little concerned because I have been coming down off of coke when I'm not used to doing it and that might be causing depressive thoughts. I may be wrong.

I'm stuck. I understand why she is not supportive, but I really like my girlfriend and I want my sister to have a good relationship with her.

TLDR: Having depressive episode due to a mix of nicotine withdrawals, drugs, twin drama and loneliness.",26Apr2020,1
139,"So today I had gone to the supermarket to buy some groceries. Guess whom I met there? It was my ex-girlfriend! We both had dated for a few months last year and then she broke up with me. It wasn't a very messy break-up, we still remained friends even after breaking up. 

So today when I saw her outside the supermarket, it was like seeing an old friend, so we both waved at each other and then we decided to walk back together as we both had to go in the same route till a point. 

So while walking, we both talked about our lives and what we were doing now a days and how we are spending our quarantine time and other random shit. Then she asked me randomly if I found a new girlfriend or if I fell in love with someone, for which I answered ""not really, but I'm actually looking for a long term relationship with a good girlfriend, unlike you"". Now I swear that I didn't mean to say ""unlike you"", it just casually slipped out of my mouth. My tongue sometimes wants to put me into trouble. After saying it, I regretted it the very next moment. I would never say such a thing to anyone ever, but I don't know what was going through my head, but it was definitely a slip of tongue and not something that I never actually meant to say. But what could be done now? I can't take back words once said. The best I could do was apologise. 

So we both stopped walking immediately, she was holding the bag of groceries in her right hand, she transferred it to her left hand, tightened her fists and hit me with the most powerful punch in the world, right in my balls. I was wearing a very thin layered black shorts and no underwear (I'm a dumb idiot), so the I felt the full power of her punch. I didn't even get the chance to apologise to her, she was so quick with the punch. The punch landed perfectly on my balls (it was equavalent to a headshot with a 9mm bullet) and I dropped the bag and fell down on my knees, holding my crotch with my hands and suffering pain so intense, that I had never suffered anything like that in months, maybe even years (I broke my leg a few months ago, it was still not that painful imo). There was nobody else in the streets where we were. I just looked up after a minute and she was gone. I didn't even get to apologise to her. The pain was so much, that I puked on the ground. 

I got up after a few minutes and ran home. It was very painful even while I was running. I was holding my crotch the entire time while running for protection. I immediately reached home and crashed on the bed. I was sweating, I was breathing heavy, I had tears in my eyes, I was squirming in pain, I had peed my pants a little bit (just a little bit), I had very intense pain in my testicles and my stomach as well, my legs were vibrating. I thought I got a fever or something. I removed my shorts immediately but very luckily, my balls were still intact. While coming back, I was really worried that I might probably have swollen balls and I might probably have to get a surgery and get my testicles removed. Luckily, nothing of that sort happened. I'm good now. Now these definitely aren't exaggerations, I promise.

Apart from all the pain that I suffered, I did suffer few other loses too, as I left the grocery bags on the street, like come on, of course I couldn't carry the bags with me while coming back. Shit, I wish I never met her today. Now I don't know if I should text her and apologize or not.",26Apr2020,1
140,"If it were just ‘Fred the guy who lives across the street’, it would be odd, and possibly criminal to try to get pictures of him, or believe that you ‘know Fred’ and have an opinion about him based off of his Facebook posts, or talk about him, idolize him, have a picture of him hanging in your living room, and so on. Any or all of the above are behaviors generally attributed to psychopaths/stalkers/creeps. Yet when it’s a celebrity, suddenly none of that applies.

The whole paparazzi culture- the fact that is even a profession- is quite strange at face value.

“This girl was at the beach- and we stalked and photographed her! Look how beautiful/ugly she is!” 

This guy went to the grocery store, and we got PICTURES of him shopping- they’re just like us!”
**People Magazine: we do the stalking so that you don’t have to!**

Think about them as “person I have never met”, instead of “celebrity’s name”. This is a great way to frame it for what it is. Take tabloid magazines/internet sites- such as TMZ or People magazine. They legitimately stalk these people, hoping to run into them, and when they do catch them, they will say things to them hoping to get a reaction and then get that reaction on camera. If a single person did that to me, it would be very unsettling to say the least- never mind an ENTIRE ORGANIZATION/company dedicated to stalking people. I feel that the cultural obsession with celebrities cannot be healthy for the people involved in it, both the celebrity, and the ‘voyeur’. This is clear from the past behaviors of, idk, almost every huge celebrity since Marilyn Monroe. Too many to list. I find it very interesting, and personally just do not understand it. Someone I know sent me that video of all of the celebs singing ‘Imagine’, and told me how inspiring it was. Suffice to say that for me, I thought it was just straight up weird watching people I do not know at all, singing a song. The only thing that video ‘inspired’ was this post!",26Apr2020,1

Today however, I was given a rude awakening. I tried to convince myself whatever it was here became bored and so gave up their aggressive tactics. I mused perhaps it was boring to haunt people how cant really leave their home. 

But a short while ago, I heard some strange music. At first I thought maybe the rest of the family came home from their errands in town but there weren't any voices and the car was still gone. 

I listened as close as I could, but like with the voice I heard a few months ago, the words sounded like English but none of the words made sense. Though I heard the sounds clearly, they still sounded like nonsense. And there didn't seem to be anything instrumental aiding it like you would expect. Just...a woman singing in a strange manner. 

I even checked to see if it could possibly be coming from my phone or laptop since the television was off. It stopped shortly after I began searching and I left it alone.

I am talking to someone that I am really attracted to, but she is just consuming my thoughts. I find this happens whenever I start talking to someone who I would want to be with.

This usually ends up with me developing feelings early on and getting hurt when it ends, and by that I mean it just never really starts. In addition, it makes it nearly impossible to focus on my goals and the things I’m working towards. Anyway, it’s happening now, and this has happened to me enough to where I know this is a dangerous road to go down, but I just can’t seem to stop think about her.

164,"Tagging NSFW for mentions of sex and nudes, just in case.

I (F21) live at home with my parents (F49) (M54). A while ago when I was probably 13, I caught my mom sending nudes to someone. I don't know who, but I saw the photo and heard her gushing to a friend at the time over the phone saying things like ""I sent it to him!"". My sister (F28) knew about this and confronted her, she just said she sent it to our father.

I have a few reasons to not believe her. At most, my parent's relationship can be described as a platonic companionship. I've never seen them kiss. To my knowledge, they haven't had sex in years. They don't even share a bedroom together due to each other's snoring. 

Recently, while looking for old high school photos, I accidentally stumbled upon a new set of nudes on her computer. I can tell they were new because they were taken in our new house we moved into during my sophomore year of high school. I don't know HOW new they are, they could be years old at this point, but they exist.

I could believe maybe she just took them for herself as fun, but given what happened when I was 13, and given she has maybe once or twice very obviously tried to cover up where she disappeared to, I suspect it could be more. During these times she would always tell a different story, she would say she went somewhere where I happened to be and I wouldn't see her there, she wouldn't give a definitive answer but would come home with ""gifts"" from a coworker. This hasn't happened often at all, most days she goes to work and comes home. She spends almost every weekend at home and never goes out socializing unless it's a company party once every few months.

My father has let himself go a bit after me and my sister were born. He gave up alcohol and has been hitting the gym lately, but he's become a somewhat unpleasant person to be around, which I guess is practical with aging. He gets WAY too heated over politics, is very rude when talking to other people online, and has become just a bit more oblivious to everyday things. I hate to say it, but I wouldn't want to marry someone like him either, but he is still a relatively loving father to our family and wasn't abusive, just obnoxious a lot of the time.

I can't bring this up to her without an intense shit storm happening and probably tainting our relationship forever, and she has mental health issues like me which I'm afraid of triggering. I also don't want to really make a big deal out of it potentially being nothing (like I said, maybe this time she was just trying to play with taking ""artistic nudes"" and didn't really send them to anyone or something) and she usually has no problem giving me her phone or even reading her texts, but honestly I never took a good look at them for fear of finding something I wish I hadn't.

I am an adult now, hoping to move out within the next few years, and frankly I can see why she would sway away from my dad after how much he's changed from when they married. I want to think what she's doing is an escape route or her coping with her youth slipping away along with my dad's behaviors becoming more annoying, but it still gnaws at my stomach. 

Sorry for the long post. I feel like I can get over this by trying to justify this with the reasons I just listed, but I just feel like I need to get this off of my chest. I am an adult, I have accepted the fact that my parents are not very in love with one another a long time ago, and I think I'd prefer to not say anything to either of them and to just let them hash out whatever is left of their marriage in their upcoming golden years together. 

Hopefully by then I will be out of the house.",26Apr2020,1
