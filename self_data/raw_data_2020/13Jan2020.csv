0,"I feel like I should come with a warning so people know how much of a mess I am before they decide to become emotionally invested in my well-being. 

I don't because I crave human connection and telling them tends to scare them away, but I feel like an asshole because I'm giving them time to start caring about me and then telling them and most people are not going to leave at that point, even if it's best for them. Then they feel like they need to help me, and they feel down when I'm down and I don't want to being people down. 

Or I don't tell them, they eventually find out, and then they feel bad for doing something that triggered my PTSD even though they had no way of knowing because they didn't even know I had PTSD.


I have severe PTSD as well as bipolar 2 with some psychotic symptoms. I'm trying my best to recover and manage. 


I mostly feel this way when it comes to my partner.",13Jan2020,1
1,"This program will help you undo financial bondage.

The benefit to using federally regulated 401k, 403b, and 457 investment plans offered by your employer is that a portion of your earned income can be placed in these plans on a tax-deferred basis. This allows workers to invest about one-third more than they could have otherwise invested in non-tax-deferred plans offered by other financial institutions. Federal law allows employers to let you invest thousands annually in each plan. You would pay no income taxes on this money until you withdraw it from the account. This gives a greater amount of money the opportunity to experience great compound growth gains over a few decades of investing, which is usually far better than earning the same percentage growth on a far smaller amount of dollars deposited in a non-tax-deferred plan.

These accounts generally include an array of investment choices such as stock, bond, and fixed-interest funds. In most plans you can select a variety of vehicles that allow you to diversify deposits and accumulations. Many employers will match your investment to a certain maximum level like $2,000 annually or 6% of annual pay.  This is free money you won’t get until you invest through these plans. After you build your initial $1,000 emergency fund, it is usually best to get the employer match no matter where you are in the Seven Steps process, unless you cannot possibly pay off your debt within the next year or two by reducing unnecessary expenses or by initiating additional income via second jobs or entrepreneurial endeavors. 

A dollar match for each dollar deposited gives you automatic 100% return on your deposits, a fifty-cent match for each dollar deposited gives you a 50% return, and a 25 cent for each dollar gives you a 25% return. A few employers give better matches than these. For example, if you deposit 5% of your pay into the plan, they will deposit 10% of your pay, which is an immediate 200% return on your investment. Over the period of investing, this provides for growth on matched dollars that is far greater than you can get from non-matched dollars. 

Until you eliminate all non-mortgage debt it is usually best you do not put in these accounts more than the amount necessary to get the employer’s maximum match. Thus, all other disposable dollars can be put toward debt elimination, which will save you from consequences of having loan finance charges that continually far exceed what you could earn in the investment markets, such as debt bondage that:

· Makes you eventually stop investment deposits. 

· Causes you to take out loans and/or withdrawals from the account before you retire (for which you might pay extra taxes and a penalty) to try and pay crushing debts and monthly household expenses. 

· Severely disrupts or eliminates your ability to build wealth for retirement years, future endeavors, and abundant giving.  

· Makes you have to work many more years than you really wanted at jobs you no longer have passion for, because you have not built a sufficient nest egg to live comfortably without an employer dictating your efforts, time spent, and earning power. 

· Puts you in the position of living in poverty in your senior years. 

You will pay an ordinary income tax rate and 10% penalty for early withdrawal before 59.5 years of age, So, it is costly to withdraw money from the plans. This should keep you from squandering money put in during earning years so you have a chance at building wealth needed to maintain abundant, a comfortable lifestyle during retirement, and future entrepreneurial endeavors. Most plans allow you to take a loan against your account up to approximately $50,000 or 50% of your accumulation, whichever is smaller. A downside to doing this is, within five years, you must pay off the loan using after tax dollars and that money will be taxed again (its double-taxed) when you withdraw it in future years. Also, if you lose your job or are laid off then you must immediately repay the loan or it becomes income to you and at tax filing time you will have to add it to your income and pay taxes and penalty on it.

In both the withdrawal and loan scenarios, for decades, you lose compound growth on the money borrowed that likely would have provided far greater wealth accumulation if the money was left in the account. Unfortunately, about 50% of account holders withdraw and/or borrow from their accounts and some do so several times during their working years. This seems to be one reason why many accounts show meager investment accumulations for many people 55 years and older. 

Let’s correct this shortcoming by adhering to the scriptural principle that shows believers continually engage a pattern of investing for growth, which allows them to continually give abundantly and carry out the purposes to which the LORD calls them. Remember, a wise man builds and maintains treasuries, whereas a foolish man spends everything he gets. 

Please pray for this ministry, email me with any questions, and contact me to speak at your business or ministry conference or workshop. May the LORD bless you richly as you follow His plan!

2,"I'm sorry if this is incoherent but it's late and my thoughts are all over the place.

In a few days, it'll be decided if I'm allowed to continue to study at my university or not. It all depends on one exam I took last week and it's my weakest subject. I studied my ass off but I don't think I passed.
How do you deal with the thought that you have to leave? My life and my friend that I made in the last two years. Of course I can always visit them but it's not the same.
I'm only 21 and I know there is still time to achieve my dreams but right now I'm just desperate. I feel so lost. I wanna cry and scream.
My mom already offered to take on a loan so I could continue to study at a private uni.
But she doesn't need another burden and that's what I feel like.
A burden someone has to take care of who can't deal with his life on his own.
When my sister is my age in 2 years, she'll already have her bachelor.
I just want to succeed, stay with my friends and graduate.
Does anyone have any tips or ideas on how to deal with that? Is ist just acceptance?",13Jan2020,1

8,"Yesterday I was getting out of work and went to check when the next train came. Less than 2 minutes it said. (Unbeknownst to me at the time) the train station was a little over half a mile away. 

&amp;#x200B;

30 degrees out, had my backpack on, shoes with virtually no sole, extremely uneven terrain, and a giant ass staircase to finish it off. I have no idea what flipped the switch in my head to start running but I did... and I made it! Granted for the next twenty minutes I felt like I was gonna pass out and die but I made it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now if you were to tell me to run two laps around a track in less than two minutes I don't think I'd be confident in saying I could do it. I certainly don't consider myself to be in-shape, haven't even been to a gym in about a month. I hadn't known the distance and if I did I think it would have been just a mental barrier. We all know we can push our limits in order to accomplish something but yesterday really put that into perspective for me.

9,"My cat Sammy died today. He is an American Short hair and he is 5 years old. He never showed any signs of illness and this morning he was perfectly fine, but around lunch today I noticed he was hyperventilating and his mouth was open. He was limping and peed on the floor, all the whiling almost convulsing in a way. 

My mom and I rushed him to the vet. On the 20 minute car ride he was crying in pain and you could see the fear in his eyes. We had no idea what was wrong. When we got to the vet he was drooling all over the inside of his cage and crying. 

The nurses took him back to the emergency room where I finally had a rush of calm come over me knowing that he was in good hands, but after about 10 minutes the nurses came out and told us he had passed. 

He was the sweetest cat I have ever had, his death was so out of the blue that I have a hard time believing that he isn't downstairs on the couch as I write this. He was only 5 and should have had many years left to live, but as the nurse said, the type of heart attack he had could happen to any cat, of any age, at any time. 

I'm having a really hard time right now getting use to the quiet house and thought this would be a nice place to share what I'm going through and let out my feeling.

I'll love Sammy forever.",13Jan2020,1
10,"Sorry if this is a little long, I just want some insight other than family and friends that will just say whatever to make me happy. And forgive me, because I'm on mobile. I'll do my best to explain in as much detail as possible as not to be confusing.

Anyway I currently work at a bank. It certainly isn't the greatest job ever. It's low paying and it has became more of a marketing and sales job. I know obtaining acccounts and loans is how a bank makes money, but these ""goals” are quite unreasonable sometimes, along with the other tasks and procedures that are starting to be implemented. I could go on and list those too but there's so much that it is a whole other post in itself. 

I am actively job searching, and I found a full time position as a ""perishables rep"" in the produce department of Company B grocery store, that has the starting pay at a few cents more than what I make now at the bank. The kicker, back in 2017, I left Company B to go to my current banking job. 

I initially left Company B the first time due to terrible management, and at the time the banking job was more than what I made then. Despite that, Company B truly is an excellent company, and I have no doubt I would have stayed there if I didn't happen to work at an old outdated store with bad management. This position however is at a different and much newer store, so it would be an entirely different atmosphere. 

Would it even be worth it to take this ""step backward"" going from this ""professional"" banking job back to a grocery store? I'm almost certain it would not be hard to get my foot back in the door of Company B since I've already worked there previously. This year I am hoping  to take a coursr and get certified for Pharmacy Technician, and once that's completed Company B has a Pharmacy department I could apply to.

What are your thoughts? I know I'm probably completely overthinking all this.",13Jan2020,1

18,"I’m 21F for reference, and I’ve had a rough week:

- Had a potentially serious reaction to my medication (Lamictal) and had to go to the ER on Monday morning, and obviously stopped taking the medication and have since been feeling the affects of no longer being on a mood stabilizer, i.e. feeling more manic. Met with my psychiatrist yesterday and we’re deciding on a new medication to start on.

- Have been having a lot more anxiety and panic attacks which don’t typically happen for me regularly; the ER freaked me out (mom has cancer and medical environments stress me out), and my dad immigrated to the US from Iran and my mama joon lives in Tehran and I’ve been having disturbing dreams about their safety and it’s been difficult to get it out of the back of my head. 

- I started a job caring for a family of 4 disabled dogs, which has been great and really gives me a sense of purpose when I’m feeling low, but I’m there from 9/9:30-6 every week day and am balancing that with 2 classes this quarter. It’s only the first week of the job and classes but it’s a lot; definitely amplified by the week I’ve had.

So, my boyfriend’s friend was going out last night to celebrate his birthday and invited me. I had too much anxiety to go to the dinner before the party because I don’t know many of the people and am just low energy/kind of dulled out right now. My friend and I were just going to meet them there, so we drank some champagne while we got ready and went.

The car made me feel sick and I was kind of dizzy so when we got there I wanted to sit in the alley for a bit, breathe some fresh air, maybe throw up if it’d make me feel better. It’s all a little fuzzy from here, but at some point my boyfriend found us and sat with us. I just had my head in my lap the whole time because looking up made everything spin. 

The birthday boy and his group came out to get in their uber and my boyfriend was going to go but decided to stay with me. Some time later they called an uber and I didn’t want to get in because I was too dizzy, and he seemed frustrated so I got in. When we got back to our college neighborhood (we all live nearby) my friend was walking with me to our apartment and my boyfriend just said “it’s time for me to go"" and left.

This morning I asked if we could talk because he seemed annoyed by me the whole night, which he admitted he did but felt bad that he didn’t put that aside to make sure I was cared for and comfortable.

I texted his friend (birthday boy) apologizing and wishing him a happy birthday and he responded very kindly, but my boyfriend definitely feels frustrated and let down (his words).

I’m just not sure what the best way to handle this is. I’ve never gotten so drunk I’ve thrown up before and I felt completely incapacitated this time, and woke up not fully remembering the night and that comes with a lot of shame. I think I was too eager and drinking too much partially because I was anxious and partially because I feel a little manic/unstable transitioning off of my medication. How do I approach this?

TLDR: was invited to boyfriend’s best friend’s birthday party, got too drunk so just sat outside on the sidewalk the whole time. My boyfriend feels hurt and let down by the situation. I’ve never gotten too drunk before and I feel embarrassed about it; I’ve had a grueling week and think I made poor decisions partly because of that. I just don’t know how to rectify the situation",13Jan2020,1

20,"So not intentionally but my group of friends found my reddit account and went through it and I'm not sure who read what but I'm pretty sure they would have seen mostly everything. I've been distancing myself, I just feel so so uncomfortable every time I talk to them I have flashbacks of the posts I had posted (all deleted now, and this is a new account) and I just cringe and feel so nauseas and humiliated. I don't consider myself a private person but there are some things that I would just never ever want anybody in my life to EVER read or know about it and all of these dark thoughts and extremely personal things about me were shared with all 5 of them.

I just honestly don't know how to get past this. I know I'm the only one that's bothered by it, they clearly don't care and they probably don't even remember but just the fact that they've seen them. For context, there was a lot of posts about my pretty traumatic breakup, my anxiety disorder (which not many people know about) and some really self deprecating shit from a year ago. I just don't know how to move on from it. I feel so exposed, like a secret part of my life was just ripped open and revealed to my friends. I don't like it. I want things to go back to normal.

I feel like people out there aren’t always so happy all the time so I decided to share a story about myself to make people happier and feel good about themselves.

A couple of weeks ago, I actually passed my permit test. I feel really good about it and I can’t wait to start driving at some point. I would really love to be able to go out there and see some really wild things on my road trips. Who knows? Maybe I’ll even see a dragon fighting a man eating hippo lizard outside my window a lots of other crazy stuff.

I can’t wait to get a car. I’m already saving money from my job at Price Chopper so that way a could actually buy a car for myself.

I’m glad for what I have. I love my family, my things, my peers, and everything around me. I feel like it’s always important to be grateful for what you have. I like my job and I’m able to make money from it.

I also can’t wait to go to college next year too. Any advice you’d want to give me by the way? I’m so happy.

I also know that one day I will be able to meet the girl of my dreams. An intelligent and smart girl that has the same common interests as myself. She’ll also be beautiful and kind and powerful.

I realize I shouldn’t rush things and wait to meet people who would actually love and respect me.

Anyways, life is always fun and enjoyable. There’s tons of ways to grow and develop and learn new experiences. When I also go to college, I have a passion to write my own fictional stories. Possibly even my own anime or write a story in my own video game. Life has so many different opportunities and things to be happy about. That’s what I want to teach people.

27,"So I've been playing softball or some variation of it since I was 4 years old. I'm now a junior in high school. To sum up my issue, I want to quit softball but I'm afraid I'll regret it later on. I've been feeling pretty burnt out since about 8th grade but I never quit because I thought I would disappoint my dad. My dad has pushed me a lot when it comes to softball, its how we connected. I feel like I could be devastating him if I quit. I talked to him about it and he said ""I'll learn to get over it, but just make sure you are living your life for you."" I'm also afraid of quitting cause I'm not sure of what my friends will think. We have all been together since the very beginning when it come to this. But high school changed us a lot. I'm not as close as I used to be with them, I don't hang with them near as much. But I still feel this fear of letting them down when I tell myself ""I'm going to quit."" I feel as though I'm not playing the sport for myself anymore but rather for everyone else. There's some parts that I enjoy about it, but that's mainly just the trips we take and watching my friends do good. Yet I still get so nervous when I think about actually quitting. I ask myself things like ""What will I do with all the time?"" and ""How will everyone react?"" 

I was miserable playing the sport last year. On the way home almost after every practice and game I would be crying cause I never felt like I did good enough. If I quit I just don't know what I'm going to do with myself and that scares me the most, besides disappointing everyone. I know it definitely sounds like that I should quit but there's still a major part of myself holding me back from doing it.

29,"I met this really cute and nice guy at work when I came back from school for break. Hes super nice and we talked a lot when we would close together. We actually had a lot in common. We both love video games, the PS4, WWII history, the same foods, and other hobbies. We both wanted to join the military at some point, but he cant because he is deaf and I decided I didnt want to because I liked teaching more and am currently student teaching with my old high school Spanish teacher. I invited him to play games with me and my other friends a few weeks ago and on friday night we all hung out and then it was just him and me. We both wanted to do something but I was exhausted from student teaching and there wasnt anything that we could find to do so we decided to hang out today.

I was really nervous at first, but we both went to one of our favorite stores that sells used games, movies, and books. We spent 3 hours there and sat on the floor and talked about so much. After that I told him about a surplus store that I love to go to and he said he had never been to a surplus store. Seeing his face was like seeing a little kid in a candy shop. He found a Vietnam style helmet that he is going to use for airsoft and its great because it protects his cochlear implants. We got dinner after that and talked so much until him, my other friends, and I all met up to play games.

It was an amazing day. I've never spent that much time with a guy and actually enjoyed it that much and felt that comfortable. Hes so nice and I'm excited to hang out with him again and get to know him more before I tell him that I like him. If he doesnt like me back then I would be okay with just being friends because he is a great person.

I bought something that was counterfeit. I only noticed after I inspected under better light once the deal was done.

I called the seller and told him it was fake and he denied it. (It was)

He wouldn’t take it back so I offered to only take back half of what I paid and he agreed. 

I know it’s only material things, I’m listing things I’m grateful for and this would have only been a bonus.
 I’m an addict and after getting clean and sober I take my addiction out on buying designer sunglasses.

33,"When i was in grade school i had a ""girlfriend"" and my mom told me it was pointless. as if she was shaming me. this always stuck with me whenever i met someone i liked, and made a huge road block for me in middle school.

When i was about eight i was ""raped"" by my thirteen year old neighbor. It was a game of truth or dare. At the time I didn't realize it was wrong. Hes doing fine now and in college. at the time of writing this ive learned to forgive him. (he was raped a lot by his uncle) But through out growing up I hated him for it. Im fine now; I just cant watch transformers with out having a panic attack.

Last year I had a coworker that I hanged out with a bit. we would get high and watch shitty youtube videos. one time we started to mess around. we didnt even have sex. we hangout one more time and nothing happens. i go to work and school and find out shes been telling people i raped her. i stopped the rumors before they spread. i told people my side of the story. this made me realize that people could do that whenever they want, and that false accusations happen all the time.

A little insight to this girl. she would cut herself and wear short sleeves and show people. in no way am i bashing her for it for that would make me a huge Hypocrite . it just sort of shows though.

This summer i had a friend well call Cindy. i knew Cindy since ive lived in my town. Cindy already had a boyfriend, but my hormonal ass didnt care. we were at the park fucking around with the boombox i had gotten. she kissed me. i kissed back, and we started making out.

she told her friends and her friends told her boyfriend. she was bashed and called a whore and other such things. eventually the bashing hit me. this broke my trust. a lot. i strictly do not believe in ""dont kiss in tell""

earlier in the school year this year there was this girl that i fell madly in love with. she also had a boyfriend. she told me that she got pregnant and asked me to get her a test. i work at a pharmacy doing inventory so i get a good discount. before i gave it to her or her even telling me, we started talking and ""sexting"". she showed me a picture ofthe pregnancy test and it being positive.

in science class we were doing one of these escape room labs and me and her were partners and got to sit by each other. because of the theme of the lab it was pitch dark. she then wispered to me ""put your hand up my leg"". i started to then stopped. everything that happened with my old coworker started to come back like a flash. as if it was happening. i started to breath heavy and had to leave for a second. i just couldnt do it, but i really wanted to.

i eventually grew distant from her because of different reasons, but six months later shes not pregenant. i told cidny this and it turns out that shes faked it before. why i dont know.

The thought of sex scares me. I cant feel sexually attracted to people out side of porn. the thought of being with someone doesnt seem possible or even fun. Any insight to this?

TL;DR: Ive had a shitty expierience with sexual relations and has made me not able to feel emotionally vulnerable.",13Jan2020,1

36,"We started an argument in the morning via text while he was at work. In a nutshell, he called me manipulative for not being direct about my needs. I called him out on it and did my part of the apology for not being direct and empathetic. We cooled down and our days went on. 

When he came home, I was still feeling a little bit off about our argument because he hadn't apologized for coming at me so strongly.  I dismissed it because he had literally just gotten home from work. We continued our normal dance of welcome home with hugs and kisses.

After a few minutes of being home, he came into the kitchen, hugged me, and apologized for his words and behavior from earlier. Hearing that sincere apology from him (not a text) is one of the most respectable things someone has done to me. It might not seem like much, but I genuinely appreciated that he was able to admit he was in the wrong for his reaction and say/do something about it.

Why I took the year break off was because it just took a whole lot of me. Mentally. Plus I was suffering with depression a lot, to the point I wasn't even focused on school anymore. It was a wasted year but it was worth it. I made my year break the most of it. 

Now I'm going back. To finish highschool and get that damn diploma. 

I hope this time, I will focus more. Because if i dont, I'm never gonna travel to the country I always wanted to see.

46,"i am a junior in highschool, who had her life somewhat together. ccan’t say the same anymore.

during my freshman and sophomore uear, i was a straight A student. not a single grade less than 90 on my transcript. it was my plan to keep this streak up, score well on my SATs the following year, get into a prestigious college , major in biomed because i find biomed interesting and fascinating. currently even in a very renowned science research internship.

however, junior year came. marking period one(of four) transcript came out, got my first 80’s ever. three of them. at once. in ap calc ab, ap chem, and film study.

it’s ok, colleges want to see improvement. push yourself harder, improve your grades, do better next marking period. you will be fine.

flash foward to the present, two weeks before the second marking period ends. exams start tommorow. i am currently failing ap calc and ap chem. the 90 is so far. even the 80’s and 70’s are far.

words can’t describe my devestation. been days since i last slept and i have been pulling consecutive all nighters. test after test, i just took one two days ago and i have a test tommorow again, in the same subjects. but no matter how much i study, i’m getting no where.

don’t give up... right ? but where is any of this getting me. clearly im no good at either math or chemistry. i’ve asked people to help me and i understand it when they do, but when i’m alone, nothing clicks. my grades are ridiculous. no chances into the colleges that were somewhat in reach anymore.

i’m so devestated, worn out, anxious, scared, lost, upset. i’m not verbally expressing it but my heart, eyes, head all hurts. i can feel my body internally screaming feelings that feel like: ‘??????!!!!!?!?!?$#**%*#+{£\£\£\???????’

i don’t even have time to study for the SATs anymore because i’m studying for my classes (getting me no where)

what happened to last year, where i effortlessly got amazing grades ? i cut myself off from my social media, hanging out with friends, etc.

and now, i just have no more motivation. i know that i can’t just stop. but , the urge is so strong. it just feels like ?????

i keep telling myself ‘ it’s okay ‘ and pick myself ip to keep trying again. but , this cycle of being knocked down repeatedly is so ?!;’skejwk.....

what do i do ? what is my future anymore ??

im rethinking my career path too. why was i even interested in biomed ?? the work of biomedical researchers (my supposedly end goal) is so fascinating to me. but do i really want to be in a lab all day ?

what other career paths can i go ? how do people live such happy stressfree lives, like the people at buzzfees who can just travel and eat food , while getting paid for it? do i still have a chance of getting into good colleges/unis ??

can i be happy and smart at the same time ? what resources do i need right now ? what do i need right now ?

can someone help me ? can someone yell at me if i’m doing something wrong and thinking the wrong way ? can someone tell me honestly if i even have a shot in the world anymore ???

47,"I've probably spent the last 4 years in university doing the same thing, going to class, home, and watching videos or playing games until I sleep.

I feel like I have no other hobbies or something that I can express my creative self. Seeing videos of people who are great at what they do inspire me to want to be like them, resulting in me searching ""how to get good at X and Y"" and of course never taking the first steps to actually learn anything.

I've taken interest in singing, video/photo editing, music production, music theory, playing instruments and that only thing I've tried learning was video editing (I had 3ish projects that I had a lot of fun doing, but starting another project is SO hard (and harder the longer I wait).

Is it unreasonable to want to be good at all these things? Each one of these hobbies takes hours and hours to become great at, would it be better off trying one hobby at a time.. and would it just end up like video editing where I have no motivation to start more projects?

I came across intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, and I feel like all these hobbies I want to pick up are (what I believe to be) from extrinsic motivation. I want to share what I create with other people, and I gain a sense of reward from that, is that a bad thing?

I don't see anything else that would be from intrinsic motivation other than maybe video games. Are hobbies based purely on extrinsic motivation bad in the long run? Is it hard to maintain motivation?

Civilizations have said for as long as they've existed that the world was ending but this time we have factual evidence that climate change is literally bringing on the apocalypse, and we'll most likely not be able to stop it. All we can do is watch and make some dank memes about it. 



And all we can do through all of it is work. The only purpose, we're just worker drones to serve the queen bee billionaires. If we did some other poor person will have a kid just as quickly to fill in the gap. Just how they want it. Work 9-5 for 50 years and have your stupid kids so they can suffer too.

56,"Just need a second to get my thoughts out. Also I’m on mobile, so sorry about that.

To start off, I’m the product of a military family. My dad is in the Army and is still serving today, I think 16+ years ongoing. Since my dad is in the army that means we often move a lot, so I’ve been to a lot of schools. During these times I learned not to get too attached and just have a good time at these schools before I’m whisked away to the next. Though in my sophomore year of high school, I wish things turned out differently. This happened in an old high school in Kentucky, a school meant for military brats like me.

She came into my life pretty late, I think she was a new girl who showed up in my second semester that year. We took the same art class together, and sat next to eachother. I thought myself shy, but she was on a whole different level. Super quiet, timid, gentle, all sorts of things. I was often shy too, but overly loving towards those who I got comfortable enough with. This girl taught me boundaries, as she didn’t feel comfortable receiving hugs. Every art class I would make small talk with her and she started to open up.

She loved reading. She absolutely loved it, I think there wasn’t a moment she didn’t have a book in her arms. I remember there were times when lunch would arrive and we would use that time to go to the library to stay away from he loud noises that overwhelmed her. Once we even went to the public library outside school and read quietly for a few hours before our parents picked us up. If we weren’t reading, we were sharing interests, and we had a lot in common actually! We bounced ideas off eachother and she especially loved my interests in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, my favorite book and concept. I still geek out about it today.

The best memory I have with her is when I finally invited her over to my house so we could watch a movie. Repo! The Genetic Opera. It was a movie our art teacher recommended highly, actually. She piqued our interest, and we already had an interest in horror and gore and such. Even if my friend was timid and innocent, she wasn’t all that after all. We couldn’t have been more excited that day, and our parents rented the movie for us to watch. It was so much fun, us quietly chatting and laughing at the more outlandish death scenes.

After that, we went to my room where I learned she also had a high interest in Bo Burnham, my favorite comedian. We had a major geek fest and sang the songs together as we watched Bo’s What show together on Netflix. She couldn’t stay the night and had to be picked up later that day, but it was amazing. I was so happy to have experienced this with her, not to mention how much she had opened up since we met.

We were inseparable. I of course was so thankful to be her friend that I made sure to beg my mom for the chance to buy a gift for her. It was a bookmark, based on our favorite webcomic aboutJekyll and Hyde. I bought two bookmarks, she got Jekyll and I got Hyde, I felt like it worked pretty nicely. Or was it the other way around? She loved it, as I had hoped. I knew she loved reading, after all.

She got me a gift later on as well, a gift she got from Etsy. It was a bracelet, made of snow globe like plastic domes encasing small cut out sections of the pages from the Jekyll and Hyde book. Small words like “Jekyll”, “drug”, “terrors”, things like that, but I loved it and wore it the rest of the year. I still have it today, and I keep it close.

She also made me a little comic, something she drew herself. It was mildly based on Eddsworld art, as if she used specific frames as a reference for it. The first panel showed me hugging her. The next panel showed her freaking out over boundaries as such, but the next panels showed the panic fading and her gently hugging me back, with the writings saying “She is an exception.” She signed it off with her name and a statement on her art skills, and let me keep the drawing. I’m not sure where it is, but I have them in a form immortalized on my phone.

However, despite how happy I was with her, I did eventually have to go away that same semester. My dad was going to be stationed in Alabama, and soon. She and I were devastated of course, but there wasn’t much we could do. I don’t remember if she didn’t have a phone or what, but we couldn’t get contacts or anything. All I have left is what she signed in my yearbook.

This is what she said:

“You took the time to understand me when nowone else did. You were my only friend this year, but I would rather have you than everyone in this school to be my friend. May you never need to banish misfortune. May you find kindness in everything. Bless you with love for the road that you go.”

I’ve tried to find her, and I did end up finding a Facebook profile. Though it only has one image of her, and it says from that point she lived in Tennessee. She was a military kid like me after all. The photo was taken in 2017 and that’s the only thing she had on her profile. I wish so badly that I had some way to at least say hi, or let her know I still value our short lasting friendship. I don’t know if I can use her name for the sake of her privacy, but I hope I can at least cross paths with her again.

I wonder if she still has that Dr. Jekyll bookmark..",13Jan2020,1
57,"im a lurker here usually, and don’t know much about anything but i’d rather not talk in-depth about this to my best friend or significant other, so here’s somewhere for my words to go i guess.

For starters, i’m seventeen and in my last year of high school in Canada, up until now, i’ve never ever had a grade below an 80% in a class, and i’ve always felt like that was just, not an option. In elementary school i’d get yelled at by my dad if i wasn’t too of the class, which eased up when seventh grade came around once my dad noticed i was driving myself to panic attacks at the thought of doing badly on a test. It’s currently three AM, i have a final in the morning, and i decided to check my grades online. My chemistry mark dropped 4% to a 76, and immediately it’s like my brain is just on a loop of “kill yourself” and i just, thought i was over that.

I don’t want to die, i’ve made promises to people that i’d keep myself safe. Most of all, after my last little episode of extreme suicidal urges a year and a half ago, i promised myself i’d stay alive because there’s a lot more flowers for me to see. and this seems kinda dumb i guess, but flowers are my favourite, and they make days good, and i don’t wanna miss out yknow. so i want to be alive, i just can’t seem to stop telling myself the opposite. 

Over christmas break, i think i had a relapse in disordered eating, and idk what i weighed before compared to currently but people have pointed out that i lost some weight. it hurts, because one of the people, my mom, knows i struggled with unhealthy weight loss methods but immediately complimented the change before even bothering to question of i had lost the recent weight in a good way or not. i don’t know. it feels bad. i’m stressed, it’s finals season, i’m trying so hard to stay on top of things but i can’t  seem to, i feel stupid even though i know it’s ridiculous but i’m not sure what to do about it. I’m sick of how i look but i feel incapable of approaching weight loss in a healthy way, i’m sick of stressing over grades but every time i try cut myself some slack i end up feeling overwhelmingly disappointed in myself. i had suicidal thoughts/ urges at ages five, twelve, and fifteen and i really just don’t want that again, i’m just scared things are getting bad.

that’s the end of this post lol, sorry to anyone who bothered to read the pointless ramble",13Jan2020,1
59,"This is an issue I've been having for a while and I don't know what to do about it. I've spent countless nights looking up remedies to help, but I can't find anything.

I slowly came to realize I can't stay emotionally attached to someone. I don't know why. 

I've never been in love. Not in true love, anyway. I've liked people. A lot. Almost to the point where I feel like I'm in love. But it always seems to fade. If I find a guy who gives me attention, treats me well, and is attractive, I start to like them.  And those feelings will consume me for a while. But then as soon as they come, they go away.

All my feelings will slowly fade away for no reason. I realize ""*oh I don't like them, I was just infatuated.""* Then I start to feel trapped. 

I don't know why I'm like this. I'm actually a very sensitive person. I have no issues with building bonds with family and friends.

Sometimes I wonder if it's because I tend to be alone a lot. I love hanging out with friends and such, but after a while I start to get tired. Oddly enough, I feel like a battery in need of a charger. And being alone *is* my charger.

I'm a very private person. I don't like sharing my feelings with others. When I do share them, I only share certain things. Only certain people can know certain things about me. I've never been comfortable with one person knowing *everything* about me. My insecurities. My odd theories. My flaws. My opinions. My dilemmas. It would make me feel very exposed.

I found an article where a lady struggled with this, too. She partially blamed it on her family. I thought maybe that's it - maybe thats why I struggle keeping an attachment. Everyone in my family has had dysfunctional relationships. My mother and father included. I grew up in an environment lacking love.

But I don't like blaming my family on my romantic issues.

The truth is I hate being like this. It's hard. I stay up late a lot thinking about it. Wondering what's wrong with me. Perhaps they're other people with the same issue? Regardless, it makes me feel like a terrible person.

There was a guy I was involved with once who I genuinely cared for. We weren't involved long, but the connection was strong. He cared for me. He trusted me. He confided in me about some of his most intense insecurities. And for a while, I thought ""*wow, he could be the one. I've never felt this way before.*""

That came to an end, though. The feelings I had for him slowly drifted away. And I felt trapped in this relationship. He was so sweet and perfect and loving - and yet, I was losing the ability to reciprocate. When I finally ended things, it was devastating. I contemplated going back, but I knew it wouldn't be the same.

I hurt him. I didn't mean to; I just didn't have the same romantic feelings anymore. And boy, did I feel like a piece of sh\*t.

I've caught myself a few times since then catching slight feelings with people. One friend that I confided in told me I should just give it another shot. They said I was still so young, I just have to wait til I meet ""the one."" I don't know if I believe they exist.

The reason I took the time to write all of this is because I'm curious if there's anyone else like me. Anyone who falls madly in love for a short time, but then all feelings fade after a few months. I don't know what to do or how to fix it. I'm lonely, I'll admit. A few times I've been tempted to give another shot at a relationship, but I don't want to inevitably hurt someone again.

I've never really gone into full detail about any of this to anyone, only just bits and pieces. Typing it all out kind of feels calming in a way. I know it's not a huge issue; there's so many bigger problems in the world. I just really hope someone can relate to this. Or even if someone could just give me advice to change it.",13Jan2020,1
60,"I’ve had persistent depression since I was very young. I usually try to shove it away, or just carry it until one issue fades into another. Makes the past one feel like its disappeared, right? I’m in that life-constricting, early to mid-twenties phase of life and the past seven months have been utterly soul-crushing. It feels every week or so some new development blindsides me e.g. family or personal tragedy, relationship issues, financial issues, complications in my student or work life, etc.

A few months ago my partner at the time and i  broke up with me shortly. I felt it was my fault and I could have done more to make things work. As part of a list of things I thought could help mend things I would go see a psychiatrist and work on my negativity. We had gotten back together by the time the wait for my appointment had ended (soonest availability was 1 month). The Dr. talked to me for maybe 20 nins where i expressed my reluctance for medication or help prior but explained I made the decision to make an appointment because i knew it may help. He then threw a scrip for Prozac at me. It was small, 20mg. I had felt alright for a week or so, but I don’t think I’d attribute that to the meds. Probably just felt I was making progress out of the hole i’d been in for 4 or 5 months. I ended up missing my follow up appointment and not returning. For a bit, aside from a few constant stresses, some incidents among peers at school, and a increasingly negative atmosphere at work, Its been fine, I guess. I had been very anxious my gf would leave me again over some  thing small e.g. me not acting ideally in a social engagement. Being a bit introverted and maybe psyching myself out before even going to said engagement. 

We just came back from a week at my moms place and today she decided to tell me she’s unhappy, doesn’t see herself wanting a relationship, nor being able to be a good partner with her work and school commitments. No real communication beforehand other than her not liking my “negativity”* at her friends New Years party before our trip to my mom’s. 

*”Negativity”being my vocalized fear that I wouldn’t have anyone to talk to since I knew none of her roommates friends. Which did and didn’t happen, I eventually warned up after being kinda quiet and had a decent time.

I can’t help but to feel responsible. I’ve always been rough on myself whenever something doesn’t work out across any aspects of life. I wont stop thinking “oh I should’ve payed more attention to x,y or z detail” “I could have, should have done this this not that” “I could’ve tried harder”. Needless to say i can get caught up ruminating. 

My anxiety has never felt like much of an issue, but I myself, my roommates, and my family have all noted and seen it become more prevalent over the last seven months. I’ve fallen out of my habits slowly, like maybe 6 weeks ago I stopped going to the gym daily and gained like 10lbs. I feel worthless, I’m so close to graduating after 6 years of collegial purgatory, but I feel I’ve got very little left to give after the blow I took today, and this (hopefully) last semester will be an intense once. I’ve had on and off difficulty sleeping for months and i’m not sure how much longer I’ll be able to keep this up if this volume difficulties persist. 
 
I also just left my job in the food industry while pursuit of a lighting design and manufacturing job. However, I don’t think I’ll be a be to work the schedule they had planned for me now that my class schedule has shifted and I’m technically full time. The food industry job has definitely not been good for my mental health, although my coworkers were a support system as real lows.

It isn't anything religious, I just wanted to figure out my like before even trying to find someone. Get a sustaining job, figure out who I am, etc.

And I'm still like that. Haven't found a good job, and I am still working on my self-esteem.

My problem right now is that most people, if not everyone around my age has dated and has experience with this stuff. I'm worried that, when I find myself in a good position to look for someone to be in a relationship, people won't like it or will be disappointed in my lack of knowledge, or they'll be uncomfortable since it'll probably take a while before I'm comfortable having sex, or having trouble kissing, etc.

 I shifted in hostel about a year later than the start of the session, by that time, almost all of the people here had made friends, since I shifted late, I haven't been able to make a single friend in 4 months. 

I stay in my room all day long, only leave for lunch, dinner and bathroom. There's a single window in my room and I keep it closed at all times because anyone crossing the hallway gets to see the inside view of my room if I have the window open. So I'm in the room at almost all times with a white tube light glowing the room. I don't get to know when the sun sets, what's the sky outside, what's going on outside, all I see is the white light shining in my room, at all times, night and day, I can't go outside to even sit in a ground for studying due to my social anxiety that has built up during the past few months. I had a panic attack today just because of the eerie silence in my room and the feeling of isolation. I didn't use to be this much socially awkward and I don't know what to do about it. 

I can't even study at all because the only escape from this room is the small world I've made for myself online. I watch YouTube videos, scroll through reddit or Instagram to escape, and end up wasting hours. This room is mentally eating me up.",13Jan2020,1
69,"I'm really confused about. We're in the same high school, sophomore year and I have a very small crush  on him. We've become friends since December and we talk a lot through text and in school. He teases me about certain things I do from time to time (all in good fun) and we basically have fun when we hang out in school.

I would have never thought that he might have a crush on me, but the thing that  made me suspicious is that he texts me very often ever since December  (almost everyday). Another thing I noticed is that last week we had different classes but he walked with me, came into my class (our school is pretty chill about this stuff), and was reluctant to leave even though he had friends in his other class and could pretty much do what he wanted in that class. Even after he left, he came back once or twice in the beginning and talked to me.

So, do you guys think he's just doing something a normal guy friend would do or could he have a small crush on me? Thanks to anyone that responds.

UPDATE!!!

So today in school we were playing an online game in one of our classes and the two of us compete while this stuff even though more people play, and there were other ppl sitting in between us but he pulled up his chair next to my desk and joked saying he was going to teach me how to play since he's so good at it. 

And then we started watching a tv show that I reccomended to him and I was rewatching. He said he was on the same place were I started the video from and asked me for one of my earbuds. We stayed in class watching for a while although everyone else left for lunch and it slipped out later that he had actually already watched that part of the video before.

We had to attend a 2 period long presentation afterwards and since we have different friend circles we sat separately, but after we were told to change seats by class he literally dumped his bag on the seat next to mine from a distance and came and sat next to me. We constantly talked to each other during the presentation. I don't know if this is because he really wanted to sit next to me or because he just wanted a good seat.

Now I know that these may seem like really obvious signs to y'all but I don't understand if this is something a guy would normally do with friends or with his crush,",13Jan2020,1
70,"It feels like a stone wall. It towers over my person. Sometimes there are little men sitting up top shouting and jeering and laughing amongst themselves. I don’t always know what they say, but you can always tell when someone is talking about you or making a joke at your expense, right? The other times, their words are like stones. Pathetic, weak, undeserving, sub-human, a shy man — a coward, unrelatable — a mutant, repulsive (yes, that’s a good one), useless. I duck for cover, and as strange as it sounds, the safest place is with my body pressed right up against that wall, arms spread, like I’m giving myself up to it. It’s harder to drop a stone than to throw it I guess.

Believe it if you want, but a few times I’ve tried to scale that wall. I don’t really try that anymore. The rocks never miss their target, the fall always knocks the life out of me, and the wall adds to itself. 

The worst part about all this isn’t even the wall. I wouldn’t mind getting hit by stones, having to hide in myself, flat against the same wall that abuses me. Those little men won’t just give up their fun in mocking me of course, but maybe I can pretend they’re just jealous at how long I can survive a stoning. Not one of those things is so bad. In fact, I welcome all of them! ... as long as I can paint the wall with my story in blood. 

No, not the wall. 

The worst part is the road. Because the road is that wall. Do you see? If the road is that wall, and the road is what a man must take, he can be certain he will die on that road. Don’t you see? If the road is that wall, he knows exactly how his road ends! — in the hail of stone and insult.

81,"Hello. I’m a 35yo male. I’m married with a son and daughter. A little background... I don’t have a college education due to going to tech school and changing my major a million times because I truly did not know what I wanted to be or do at 18. Ultimately, I joined the workforce, had a son, and got married at the age of 23 but, that is another post all together. Anyway, I work for a major soft drink company in the Atlanta area. For the longest, I worked as an automotive technician at various companies. The pay ranged between $10hr w/slight commission to $15hr straight. Not much to support a family with. I’ve also been a merchandiser for the current beverage company I currently work for and another one in the past. Both paid $15-$16hr. 

I was always the best technician and the best merchandiser at all of my past jobs. I always knew what I was doing which gave me great confidence and just an overall happiness at work and home despite low pay. Fast forward to now. I applied for a Field Service Technician position early last year for the beverage company I work for. After two interviews and a mechanical assessment, I was offered the position! I now make almost $25hr!

I service vending machines, soda fountains, and beverage coolers at restaurants and stores. After a brief two month ride along style training, I’m on my own in the field. That is nowhere near enough time to repair EVERY possible repair that I could ever run into. Repairs are very situational. So I’ve run into SOO many situations that I have no clue how to repair which is what gives me crippling anxiety while working and at home. Half the time, other seasoned techs, don’t answer the phone and other times they’d actually need to be there to see what you have going on to better access the situation.

When I’m on the clock in my van, my nerves seem to always be on edge. I find myself nervous to see what my next call/destination on my iPad is out of fear it will be something I’ve never handled or fixed before. I’ve run into some terrifying and nerve wracking situations, particularly on fountain machine calls. Everything is under pressure with CO2. If you do anything wrong or out of order while performing repairs, you could get sprayed with syrup/water creating a huge mess and wasting the customers product. Also looking like an idiot not knowing what you’re doing. Then there’s the pressure of the customer needing their fountain back up and running ASAP especially in their drive thru. Sometimes you miss things in troubleshooting and need advice or more training but, nobody picks up the phone.

Even if I asked my manager for more ride along training, I could ride with someone an entire year and still run into things I’ve never encountered! I find myself so stressed on the inside even at home because I NEED THIS. This is the first time in my life making good money for my family. My wife has made this type of money for a very long time so, I’m finally catching up. She deserves this break. I’m actually off today and have anxiety in the background. My manager thinks I’m doing great (basically based off the numbers, first stop on time, calls per hour, etc) but, she’s not out here seeing what we do. Nor does she even know how to do any of this. I daydream about going back in time to go to college for what I know I wanna be (of coarse, in my 35yo mind, I know what I wanna be). I have so many carts before my hoarse that it’ll be hell and a half going to a 4-8year university with a wife, kids,full time stressful job, mortgage, etc... But that’s also neither here nor there... Idk what I’m asking but, I really miss my past jobs/positions where I was confident and happy. I sound so ungrateful but, I truly am. Life is rough.

&amp;#x200B;

a relationship forms, and now small insecure ideas begin to blossom, and if you let them take hold even for 5 minutes, it's over, your lack of ability to rationalize trains of thought, show your true perception of self, if this perspective on your own being is incomplete, you lose respect for your partner out of sheer lack of respect for yourself. Your image of the perfect romance is a fabricated d illusion as you forget the most vital flaw, yourself, better each other, do not build up walls over your expectation not meeting reality, instead build your reality to the tune of your expectation, cultivating the good ideas, and cutting down the cancerous-like growth that are the bad ideas. Much like a bonsai master with his sheers, or a gardener with small scissors, you do not plant a seed anytime, anywhere, and come back later expecting this vibrant flowerbed to have emerged, you plant the seed, and you cultivate it, when it gets dry you add water, when it starves you give it nutrients, all these must be kept in balance, otherwise one system will corrupt, and its branches, its ideas the models of divine, perfect structure written in DNA, its perspective on what is good has been diluted from that of the rest of the plant, and so it spreads this lack of reality, only because a part of the system has begun to believe the world is dry, even if the reality for the rest of the plant was of good nature.

&amp;#x200B;

Time and action work similarly, for every action there is an inaction, for every good things, there are branches of it bad, for every good intention there is a bad idea, and for every bad there is good. Cultivate kindness and its inherent positive feedback loop gives unity, and peace.

think the end of interstellar if you could peer through every window simultaneously, and choose the one where the plant is just that little bit greener, or the one in which it grew that much further, start there, then workout what is different through this window, what functions of reality are different to which this has been the case? structure remaining the same, yet some expression of its function has allowed for growth, or traversal towards a greener, or maturer reality, so you watch, and maybe you see that actually someone had gone, spent 5 minutes each day, watered the plant, and inconspicuously left the room again. You return to your perceptive reality and create the habit, you make it true for you. this is of course infinitely referential, or rather reflective, where the closer he would go to his daughters room beyond the horizon, the more it would look like nothing but more branches of her room, fractal, referential in nature, made of self.

91,"... I'm feeling very zen about it. Let me explain

So I (21m) have been chasing this girl (20f) from one of last semesters classes for months. We started chatting after class and have hung out and smoked weed a few times. Cool girl and I was head over heels pretty quick. But lately, she's been taking days to look at my texts, coming up with excuses and just being pretty aloof overall. A few weeks of this and I was starting to lose hope that she was into me at all, but last night I figured I'd give it one last shot and see if she wanted to hit up this taco place in town that we both love.

And that's when she hits me with ""you should know, I'm in a relationship with a girl."" 

Now, by this point I'd run through just about every possible situation in my head, but I did NOT see that one coming. 

She explained that she'd been trying to tell me but was too anxious because she hasn't come out to a lot of people yet, but she didn't want to keep leading me on. 

Slightly disappointed and feeling like an idiot right now, but in a way it's the best thing that could have happened - it means I was overthinking things, she doesn't hate me, and we still get to be friends, all pressure off. We are hanging out with her cat and taking edibles later this week.

92,"Writing loosens that suffocating noose of depression, as if the words become hands and the hands squeeze between neck and knot. Writing is mother. Always there for this child, whenever he needs her. He will pick himself up with her and see his own beauty in her face of unmistakable love. When he falls and is swallowed up, lost to himself and to the world in aisle nine, she will command of depression to let him go.

But depression is the bad man. And as much as mother loves, the bad man is strong. In the right hand is the noose for the boy and in the left is the leash of his savior. So as much as writing might ease, it can’t free. 

The boy is lucky if he can write. But his words must fly. Depression reigns in his grasp and both mother and child suffocate, one in the left and the other in the right. And then he won’t even write, the desire is squeezed out and the space between flesh and flax closes, and even writing will no longer help.

From what he told me, he had kicked the gambling for good and only played virtual poker, he no longer smoked (after I begged him to stop before we found out the sex of our baby), and has been good with his money. I’m wrong about all of this. 

We found out I was pregnant on 05/19/2019. I’m due in 3 days. 

On NYE he asked me if he could go play in a small poker tournament. I was skeptical and didn’t feel comfortable, but I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt and say yes. $45 buy-in, if you don’t make it you leave. He did okay in this tournament, took cash instead of his debit card (per my request), and came home with about $300 winnings. Nothing major, but not negative. 

On 01/07/2020, he asked if he could play in another, higher-stakes tournament at a different casino. Only a $60 buy-in, and seeing as he’d done fairly well in his last one I had a bit more trust. He again left his wallet at home and took cash and his license—but wait, I was wrong again. Turns out he took his debit card too, and left his expired one in his wallet to trick me. I didn’t think I’d have a reason to check and evidently neither did he. He called me when he was finished with the tournament and told me he’d won $1,000 and that he was going to go to the Hookah lounge with his friends for a bit to celebrate. He also said he’d deposit the entire winnings in his bank account on the way home. Okay, whatever babe, see you when you’re home. He works nights, so around 2am. 

Turns out all of that last tournament was a lie, and so was a lot of other stuff. As soon as he got a job (keep in mind he was completely jobless from January-end of August), he started smoking again, and on top of that also going to the hookah lounge with friends and not telling me EVER. 
Instead of winning $1,000, he’d lost it. The entirety of his bank account balance had been spent on the poker games. He was knocked out early in the tournament so went to play at the regular tables. 

He’s been acting weird ever since. 

So now he decides to tell me today, 01/13/2020, that his account is negative and he needs help to pay for his doctor appointment today, and to make his account positive again until he gets paid.

I’ve worked so hard to get us where we are. We have a beautiful apartment together, I’ve bought every piece of baby equipment we have save for what was donated or gifted (which is mostly clothes anyway), I have paid almost all of our bills despite not having a job anymore (had to quit for baby because I’ve only worked there since sept), I pay for the car he bought (from his dad, in payments though), I hold our lease and all insurance policies. And he just basically spit it all back in my face. 

So what’s your advice, Reddit? The smoking relapses I can forgive. It’s not like I haven’t done it and not told him (early on before our official relationship, I promised I’d quit but took a few months longer than I said I would)... the hookah lounge is more expensive of a habit but ok, he doesn’t go every day and he does sometimes get it for free since his old friend owns the place. 
But the gambling...he lied through his teeth to me, to my face. He sugarcoated every honey-sweet word with promises that he had no intention of keeping, obviously. How do I keep this from exploding into a giant ball of fire? How would you feel? Am I stupid for staying? 

TLDR: Boyfriend is falling back to old habits and has lied about money in a major way (losing $1k gambling when he said he won it), our baby is due in 3 days and idk what to do.",13Jan2020,1

105,"So umm
I know its a bit of a weird question, but i ve noticed one thing and im really confused about it
So, i basically (i know it may sound like bs but why would i lie on here) i can make any girl like me(well at least majority of them), even older women. But one thing i noticed is that they start liking me after i start paying attention to them. And by paying attention i dont even mean talking to them or staring at them, but just making brief eye contact and giving off ""THE"" vibe.
Now, it kinda pisses me off, cuz, yea i know lots of guys would love to be like that, but doesnt it kinda mean that they like me cuz i make them feel special. Like nah i dont want that. I want them to like my actual self as well, like looks and etc. It should be mutual.
Heres my question i guess, if i make girls like my so easily, without even talking to them is it cuz of my looks or is it cuz of showing interest, and basically its  something any guy can do? 
Like  would u like someone only for them making u feel special and fancy or looks are needed too?",13Jan2020,1
106,"This isn’t anything inspiring, just FYI. But I have two days off so today I did literally all the dirty laundry, the towels, my bf’s clothes, mine. I vacuumed the stairs, the living room, the chairs, swept the kitchen and dining area, tried to spot clean some areas unsuccessfully. I did all of the dishes, cleaned all the counters, wiped all the surfaces, attempted to clean the tub and toilet and sinks. I ordered groceries to be delivered so I could spend the entire day cleaning, and took out the chicken so it could thaw so I could make dinner later. Dude, I even put vanilla in a mug and heated it in the oven because I heard it makes the whole house smell good (7/10).

My boyfriend gets off work and doesn’t really smile, doesn’t say anything looks nice, just goes to the amazon packages and then says he’s going to take a shower and almost seems irritated that none of his shorts or pants are to be found (they’re still drying). 

I don’t do any of this shit because I’m looking for gratification, I’m not some housewife that needs her man to like, appreciate her cleaning. But the fact that I did all this to make our area nice and make us feel good and he acts so miserable after work and it seems like literally nothing brings him joy really irritates me. I get off work and yeah, I’m tired, but I don’t act like the world is falling apart. He even went to the get the mail and then came back and complained that we would have to start getting the mail more often because he doesn’t want to be the “mail carrier” or mail boy or something. Everything that comes out of him is just pissy. It just feels like the tones he uses with me and the things he says and the way his energy feels is just, miserable. Never excitable, never grateful. 

The only times he seems nice to me is in the morning when I’m basically completely asleep and he asks me if I want any breakfast or coffee and tells me he’s going to work. It makes me feel like he only acts that way because I’m not “me” yet. Or maybe he’s just a morning person. 

Either way, I really could’ve used a little happiness today.",13Jan2020,1

I went to Ikea and they were all out of stock. I judged it as ""bad"" and suffered bad emotions and thoughts.

After a week, I ent to Ikea a second time, the same desk was out to stock but an even smaller one was available (checked on website before going). Turns out dimensions are better, instead of 120x60cm this one was 110x67. Just what I needed to make my VR space a round number (2x2m) that is the recommended space (well, it's 2x1.5 but wathever).

What I judged as bad had consequences that I judged as good. There was another thing: first time we were too many for the desk to get inside, this time there was space.

Some of those aren’t great examples as they do have large followings and are well known but you can see that they have a niche and it is covered basically solely by them, and they’re kind of weird in that they aren’t your usual popular YouTube content.

113,"I’m not here to brag about my recent success, I’ve been very humbled by my journey. With that being said, at 29, I’m recently married, just landed my dream job, no longer living paycheck to paycheck, and have never been happier. 

I’m a personal trainer, I work 10-20 hours a week, make upper five figures, and live in Southern Cali and I’m finally living my dream life. My life from 6-28 was difficult, an understatement. I know the world seems bleak and void of opportunities sometimes, but try to stay on track and never give up, and things will eventually connect. 



Before I get started, an analogy...

In life, sometimes we drift around wherever the winds carry us. We have no clue what we are supposed to be doing or where we are going. Sort of letting life happen unto you. We let ourselves get swept away like a leaf in the breeze. This left me feeling completely lost and hopeless. Once I finally had enough of feeling like I wasn’t in control of my life, I tried to steer the “winds” to carry me to where I wanted to be. Trying to control something you have no control over will ultimately leave you defeated, frustrated and exhausted. What you can do, in life, is *ride* the winds. Going *with* the flow in other words, or harvesting that energy and guiding yourself. Not drifting, not controlling, but a relationship, a give and take. Going with the fundamental grain of the Universe. This means understanding everything changes, nothing is permanent, generally speaking impermanence is the root of human suffering. You can’t control your circumstances, but you are a creator in this universe. Literally, your a meat suit filled with consciousness that can physically manipulate and interact with the world around you, and that’s fucking neat. You can influence others, build anything, steer your life to whatever reality you *believe* you can exist in. A complete and even unwarranted faith in yourself is mandatory. You must also be resilient through your failures, lest you give up or quit any difficult, worthwhile venture. Another thing, you’ll  never be done growing. I thought at a certain age I’d just be done, but life constantly challenges us with new problems, and it’s this struggle of conquering life’s problems that make you stronger, better.


Sounds simple enough, the catch...

When you live in poverty, have very limited resources, like time, and most of your conscious attention is devoted to self preservation or escapism, trying to avoid your reality. A requirement for any innovation or creation is putting in significant time thinking. You’re less likely to devote time to critically thinking of new opportunities or ideas to escape poverty when you are living in it.



My story:

6-17 toxic home life, divorced parents, horrible stepmother, police frequently called to home, brother in and out of juvenile, sister sent to mental hospital by stepmother. So, stepmother had bipolor disorder, other serious mental issues, very unstable and abused prescription meds, she is the root of my fucked up family. I quietly watched trauma unfold before me, a relatively good kid. 

17-21 Barely graduated HS. I had many run ins with the law, became a felon for drug possession, on and off probation, went to prison (briefly), spent the next few years working off fines from a minimum wage job and doing community service. Lowest point of my life, very angry at the world and my life. 

21-24 I tried to become a successful freelance personal trainer and fail miserably. Holding many dead end jobs while trying to build a clientele, I probably made ~12k/year then. Very poor, very unfulfilled. 

24-28 I tried again. I moved to new state, got a gym job as a pt, built up a respectable client base after a couple years, but left that job because I hated the owners. I signed a non-compete, so I couldn’t train for a year, so it was back to being poor with no skill set I could use to make money, thus dead end jobs again. I decided to finally go back to school at 27 and ended up taking two years off of training. Fortunate for me, my then gf supported us while I got my education. It was around this time I discover Alan Watts, who changed my outlook in life. 

All the struggle, and turmoil was just a part of this journey, I couldn’t be here we’re it not for those valuable lessons. 

This is when things began to turn around. I had an abrupt paradigm shift, and realized the world really is your oyster. I married that wonderful gf the supported me, she brought me to SOCAL after she graduated, for her career. Here I happened upon the *big fish* client that decided to hire me on retainer. Was it because of my skills, the vibe I put off, or did I fucking manifest that shit?! I’ll never know, don’t really care, it’s beside the point. Do what resonates with you, be yourself, always and never settle. When you’re vibing, the world vibes with you. 

Everyone is going there own way, and everyone is doing exactly what they are supposed to be doing at the very moment in a cosmic kinda way. It’s all part of the trip, love it or hate it, just. go. *with* it. I don’t have an exact formula to follow. Just nuggets of wisdom, hopefully someone finds them useful. 

Ps. Alan Watts is a philosopher, many of his lectures are available in podcast, if you ever feel down, give him a listen, it may help change your outlook too.",13Jan2020,1
114,"I have this weird thing where I can go through a phase of say maybe a week or so, where I feel pretty good, less anxious, more productive and able to deal with things, and the way I can always tell if this is the kind of mood I’m in is that I love listening to new music. Sounds a little odd, but during these times I’ll actively listen to all sorts of new songs and artists, I’ll want to expand my horizons, and all the while I’ll be getting more work done, not constantly overthinking (as much) or constantly just sitting aimlessly on my phone, I’ll take care of shit that’s been piling up or sign up for a gym membership or all this other stuff I always mean to do.

But when this fades, and it always does slip back into a depressive phase even if it feels like I’ve finally got a grasp on my life, I become really unproductive, procrastinate a shit ton, feel down and anxious about minor things, kind of spaced out and aimless, everything seems like shit, etc. And the way I can tell without fail that’s where my mind is at is that if I’m listening to music, I never want to listen to new stuff: it will be a select handful of songs I’m really into on repeat over and over again. It’s really weird; it can be hard to track your thoughts and really acknowledge how you’re feeling, but this has always been a sure-fire way for me to know roughly where my head’s at.

A big take away though was that there’s this guy I’ve been seeing the past few weeks. Like it’s such a different relationship than the past few I’ve been in where I’m really 100% myself and don’t really hide anything. 

I don’t even try to act like something doesn’t bother me and bring it up to him if something is, or if he notices something off he’ll ask what’s wrong. 

I should feel a lot better about it but it’s been hard. I keep thinking one day he’ll block me and it’ll be over and I’ll have to move on. It’s been so common that I feel like I’m expecting it.

117,"Hello. I'm an artist living in NYC. It's my last year of schooling here, and outwardly look successful.

118," r/TIFu and r/funny rules are fucking stupid so I will post my nightmare story here. Back in 2010, I was 17 and asked the girl of my dreams to go see Paranormal Activity 2 with me that Friday night, And she said ""I've been wanting to see Paranormal Activity 2 I loved the first one! Pick me up at 5!"" I was shocked at not being turned down. She took out a pen and wrote her number on my hand.

I arrive at 5 and I knocked on the door of her parents house and butterflies fill my stomach as I see this beautiful petite long black hair girl, skin tight jeans and a tight black Deft tones shirt on. She had curves like a mountain road and a bubble butt I would love to shove my face into. Black eye liner to light up those stunning green eyes and perfume that smelled like heaven. She was all dolled up me!

So I quickly forget saving money for the new Call of Duty by bringing her to Mcdonalds and we go to Apple Bees. With what little money I had it was going to be worth spending to get in Hannah's pants that night. We get seated and she orders a Quesadilla and for me Spicy grilled chicken smoked in cedar. We started off talking about our classes and onto music my heart skipped beats when I made eye contact and I kept studdering. She asked why I never tried talking to her and she always thought I was cute causing me to grow a hard boner I had to hide. She barely ate her expensive meal while I stuffed my face and ate every single crumb of the spicy greasy chicken.

We then head off to the movie theater. I kept silently burping and my stomach was a little funny feeling. We get seated in the very back where its nice and dark, and not a damn person sit up there with us. How lucky is that? The movie starts up and the first scary scene she says ""oh my god!"" and cuddles up to me, I wrap my arm around her and she laid her head on my chest. Trying my best to calm down my heart beat and tame my rock hard boner. She starts lightly rubbing circles on my leg with her finger and I start softly rubbing her back and playing with her hair, planning in my mind how I'm going to make my way to rubbing between her thighs.

All the sudden I get this powerful awful feeling in my stomach, like a balloon is being inflated inside me with intense pressure. I had the sudden STRONG urge to fart. With my butt cheeks pushed together I start to sweat and breath heavy. Like I was going into labor. After a few minutes I was praying to God to make it go away, begging in my mind for the pain to leave me. I had to release this demon from within, it has overpowered me and I can no longer control it, I was too scarred to get up.

The scene where the lady is sitting in the kitchen and the cabinets fly open made me jump, and there it went... Not just a fart, but a burst of warm liquid squirting out. Squeezing my butt cheeks together just made it sound higher pitch. I froze and my face turned numb. WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?! She must of not heard it because she jumped worse than I did and was catching her breath. If I get up will it ooze down my legs and onto the floor? If I just sit here will it leak through my jeans and stain the seat? I had to act NOW and my mind was racing.

So I sit there for a minute thinking about what the hell I am going to do, and an awful death smell hits my nose. A guy in front of us turns to his friend and says ""Dude did you shit?!"" He says ""God damn it wasn't me!"" and starts gagging. If I go to the bathroom she will obviously know that it was me! I'm so screwed! I then come up with ""what ever that smell is its making me sick I will be right back"" As soon as I stand up I feel it run down both my legs, I walk out and go open the bathroom door to see a overcrowded bathroom. I walk back out and see across the hall one that says ""employee's only""

I rush in there and take my jeans off to see the how bad the damage was, only to discover it had dripped down into my socks and my legs were brown all over. I take my boxers off and there is lumps of brown chili within them. NO fucking trashcan so I toss them in the toilet. I check under the sink and find a can of Lysol and tons of toilet paper. This is what I had to work with. I started shoving toilet paper into my jeans and started jumping up and down on them to soak up the ""chili"" inside. I wipe off my legs with water and soap, I toss my nasty socks into the toilet and flush, I turn around to grab the Lysol and notice water covering the floor under my feet. I quickly pick up my jeans before they get soaked.

I start asking God, Jesus, Buddha and even Satin to please help me. I was so fucked. I sprayed Lysol into my jeans and started blow drying them. This is taking too damn long, Hannah is going to know something is wrong. She is going to know I got sick and not give me life changing sex. Why me? I hear a loud knock on the door and ignore it, then the door knob starts to shake and louder knocking. I barley open it and the door flies open I peep my head out and a guy in a red polo that said ""manager"" on it stood there. He said ""is there a problem with the customer bathroom young man?"" I wasn't about to explain my horror story to this beer belly son of a bitch after I just flooded a employee only bathroom.

So I quickly put on my jeans and shoes and walk out and reach into my pocket for my phone to text Hannah saying I got sick, I will meet up with her later tonight or I'll be right back. But my dumb ass LEFT MY PHONE AND CAR KEYS IN THE CUP HOLDER OF MY THEATER SEAT. I had no other choice but to march back into that movie theater. I couldn't just bail on this chick, it's our first date and I'm not risking losing this girl! At worst all I have to say is I farted! So I go back into the movie theater and walk up to our roll and sit back down.

I turn to her and try to get the balls to tell her I got sick and she says ""did you like get sick or something?"" I said ""yeah kinda"" without even looking me in the eyes she says ""If you need to go... its cool you know"" I ask if I can meet her later that night ""I have to be up early in the morning"" I tell her I will stay and drive her home and in a few seconds she says ""I'm sorry... but can you sit at the end of the roll or something? So I get up and sit at the very end of the roll thinking about how this went from the best night of my life to how I am going to kill who cooked my meal, to how I'm not going to have any sort of future with this girl or even fuck her. With blue balls I start crying and try watching the movie. I look over when the movie ended and notice she is gone, my phone vibrates and I quickly open it. My heart sinks as I read ""g2g"" from Hannah.

I was made fun of for the rest of the year for that night. Haven't ate at Apple Bee's ever again and hope the bastard that made the food burns in hell. I would take 5 years off my life to go back in time and try to fix what happened. Every date I went on from then I drink A half bottle of Pepto Bizmo just before the date.
