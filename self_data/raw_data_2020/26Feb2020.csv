sorry this is really long- 

We were in a LDR and only got to see each other a few times a year. 

This relationship didn’t start off the best. We met online and instantly flirted hard. But then he was talking to another girl who I revealed as a catfish. A very obvious catfish at that. The flirting started getting serious and I told him LDR wasn’t for me. Somehow I ignored that and kept talking to him, falling for him. After almost a year we talked about meeting up and we did after that only a handful of times. It was then I made sure he knew I could never leave my family. I’ve always shared with him how close I am with my family- I lost my dad early on in my childhood and that made me close with my remaining family. 

I’m going to call him “D” for the sake of this post. D assured me he understood and wanted to come to me in the future to live. We talked about this many times. I opened up to D and D gave me love and attention. 

And a lot of insecurities. He made fun of me constantly and said it was teasing and joking. I would be put down for being so uptight and not taking a joke. He made fun of me over things he knew I was insecure about. My facial features, my small boobs, etc. And when I would tell him I didn’t like that he would say but I like those things about you even though the way it was said was negative. “Why are your boobs so small” or “goodnight tiny tits” apparently isn’t mean if D likes those things about me, even though it was putting me down in a way and pointing out my insecurities it was okay. D’s logic was hard to argue. And someone liking my flaws is a good thing, right? 

D also gave me trust issues. We were open about our social media as that’s where we first met. We were active on Q&amp;amp;A sites together, FB, instagram... I noticed D always liking the same girls photos. And not just liking them, commenting on them. Heart eyes, compliments of them being “hot” “pretty” or “beautiful” - I told D this all made me really uncomfortable. D said I’m just acting like a kid. I’m just jealous. I have issues. I have jealousy issues. I have insecurity issues. It’s all me. D said it’s not like he’s cheating. It’s just photos, it’s just comments. They don’t mean anything. If he’s not cheating how can I be mad? 

(TW eating disorders) Around the time I met D I was in a back and forth swing with anorexia. I had some secret tumblr accounts, but at this point in time (a little over a year in our relationship) I was really working with recovery. But with D’s constant flirting with other girls and not being in person made me so insecure I did something wrong. I asked for his passwords. I felt this was the only way for me to feel safe in this LDR. If it was just comments and likes then what was there to hide? Weirdly enough D agreed to this. Maybe it was because he would have lost me then if he hadn’t agreed. Now I wish he hadn’t so I could’ve left and moved on. 

D’s communication with other girls continued. It wasn’t serious but it was flirting- physical comments. But I can’t be mad, it’s not cheating. It wasn’t until it was that is with girl #1 we will call A. A was in a relationship so for me to question D about her was insane. Can he not have friends who are girls? Thats what he said until I found him telling her he liked her and thought she was pretty. I also found at this point that he saved some of her photos. Saving photos became another issue. This is when I decided to walk away. I was completely heartbroken. I had told D countless times about my biggest fears of relationships- being cheated on, being left, being unloved. I was destroyed. I refused to talk to him. Until he wrote me a love letter. Apologizing, saying he loved me. And how he would never do that again, he regrets it all. I bought it, unfortunately. Another mistake of mine. 

I felt so close with D. I felt a false sense of security. D sees my flaws and still loves me. He could’ve left me for A but he didn’t and he regrets it. D now promises to never hurt me. I opened up to D not long after even more about how in love I was. That he could do anything and I would still want him and love him. Boy was I wrong. And I know now that wasn’t love. It was D making me feel this way through manipulation. I was completely hooked. 

Throughout years 2-4 we had some of the same issues. D’s flirting, comments, girls photos. That’s when I found he saved a few particular celebrities photos. Beautiful ones of course. I thought this was kind of weird but D said I’m not there and he’s a guy. Even though I sent him hundreds and hundreds of my own nudes and videos it just wasn’t enough for D. He already used those ones, he’s bored of them. He needs new ones. I was often harassed about giving him more, when I said please stop asking he said yeah okay but would ask an hour later or the next day. I went completely unheard no matter how many times I said stop asking. Here have some now please stop asking that can’t be the only thing our relationship is about. 

D would say I complained too much. I was too jealous. I was too insecure. All I do is complain about him- asking for him to not ask for nudes, telling him of girls he was making me uncomfortable about. That wasn’t fair because D was going through hard times. He didn’t have a job, he was ‘homeless’ aka living on his friends or cousins couches. But I believed in D. this was bad circumstances. This was because of his bad childhood, because of his mom. So I shut up for awhile again. 

Until he cheated on me with two people and I caught it. This time the cheating was a bit different. Both the girls he cheated on me with were MTF. Now, I already knew D liked MTF, he however would use words not so pleasant. I assume it was more a sexual thing at the time. he said he just liked the porn. I was never sure how to feel about this. I’m bisexual myself, I’ve watched girl on girl and guy on guy before so this was okay. I felt it was a little weird only because I felt he was sexualizing MTF but I don’t know enough to know if that’s wrong or okay. But seeking out two MTF and talking to them, sending them nudes and asking for them in return? I did know how I felt about that and that was cheating. I felt destroyed. We broke up. I refused to talk to him. 

Well, I tried to refuse to. But me, I have this bad habit of ignoring or muting him but waiting to see what he says and the second he replies I read it and reply anyways. D told me it was his twin brother pretending to be him. D did not cheat. His brother has all his passwords. His brother always does this stuff. I didn’t believe him at first but he would call, and plead. He even had his brother talk to me and say it was him. I was so heartbroken. I didn’t know what to believe. D was so angry that I would think he would do these things. It was all his brothers fault. And just like that it was easier to let D mend my broken heart then try and leave. So D would cheat and I would be paranoid. Then I would be put down for being jealous and having trust issues. 

One year later and we have good moments and bad. I still complain too much for him but I am trying so hard to be a good girlfriend. I tell D I am jealous because LDR is so hard, it’s different when he’s not here. I wouldn’t feel insecure if he was here about other girls because then I would have D in person and those other girls would just have words. But right now I just have words too so it’s hard. I gave D money - he was homeless after all and his talk about not eating and having no where to go made me cry endlessly. Through a few months time span I probably sent $400. This was 5 years into the relationship and I had never sent money before then. That was really stupid. 

I tried to motivate D. I started research on employment centers and services. I sent things to him and he got mad. He had a job now, didn’t I think that was enough? I said I was proud of him. I was happy for him. But I wanted more for him, I didn’t want there to ever be a potential of D going back to being jobless and homeless. He deserves better then that. 

Fast forward a few months and D dumps me (the beginning of this month) because he “is never going to move” I am broken. But if you love me D you will come. But that makes you a hypocrite D said. But I told you I couldn’t move when we started dating. You said you would. You said you wanted to. D says he loves me. But he dumps me. there’s nothing I can do about it. He doesn’t care that I was crying. He didn’t care when I got angry. But that’s because he never cared in the first place. I can’t talk to you anymore D, it hurts me too much. Okay he says and messages me 2 days later. D wants to be friends. I can’t be friends with you I’m in love with you. Please leave me alone. We fight more this time we talk. He loves me he says. 

I know I’m not completely innocent. I know I put my worth in D. His fake form of love and attention would make me feel good about myself. I felt safe but I wasn’t. I did put up a fight towards the end of our relationship. I kept calling him out on the bullshit hoping he would address it and stop. I always believed in love. Love fixes everything. If you love each other you will treat each other right. Right?

I wanted to go back, I wanted to keep talking. I looked at a lot of his social media... he happens to be talking to many of the girls his “brother” cheated on me with. As if I needed more proof it was him and not his twin. Which tbh I really did. 

I’m trying to be okay. I’m trying to let go completely. Look at how he hurt me, why wouldn’t I just leave? why do I still care? why do I keep him on ignore but still check to see if he’s messaged me? why do I still log into his accounts to see what he’s doing? Why am I scared of him coming back and apologizing? Why do I want him to? Why do I know he’s bad logically but still want him? 

Oh and I know hes now messaged every single girl he swore to me he wasn’t interested in. every. single. one. 6 so far. 

I think part of me wants him to come back and tell me I’m worth it. worth more than all the shit he did to me. I want him to tell me I didn’t deserve it.

1,"I had been suicidal and depressed for the better part of the last decade. I can say that my 20s were awful. I had a shitty relationship, lost my father, tried to end my life, spent the last few years job hopping, and just embarrassing myself over and over. I felt absolutely worthless.

The last year has been a huge change. My ex dumped me right after my father died and I hit rock bottom. I'm pretty sure that helped me turn my life around. I woke up and told myself that if I didn't change, I wouldn't make it another year. And I have been putting so much work into myself. I've been losing weight, working out consistently, meditating, enjoying my life finally.

Every thing just feels good. It's been about a few months now and to be honest, it's taken me this month to really accept this feeling. I laugh and smile a lot more. I want to make connections with people, I enjoy my hobbies again. 

I am enjoying this process of being me and growing. I love my job and I am happier than ever there. I might even get a raise soon. 

I know this is a bit jumbled but I just wanted to share this. It's been such a long journey and there were so many times I felt like giving up. I'm happy I didn't.",26Feb2020,1
2,I'm at work. I'm getting more and more anxious. I can feel sad stuff creeping up on me. I want to go home but I absolutely can't afford to. I'm already in debt and I can't do it anymore. This used to be every day but now it's just sometimes. Almost seems worse cause I don't know when it's gonna hit me. At least I got used to it. I can't talk to anyone. Anytime I try to talk about something like this it turns into me being inconsolable and everything gets worse.,26Feb2020,1
3,"I miss the god I once believed in  
Deceived, he seized my weakness just to leave me  
Bereaved, I weave fantasies to ease the emptiness I'm diseased with  
I prayed love would be the remedy so desperately needed  
Mortal affections tease promises to heal wounds divinely grieving  
Though no relief bequeathed me through suffering tears bleeding freely  
Fever breeding ideal theories of what life and romance should be  
Could be me failing to treat others empathetically  
Realistically it's that I'm an existential singularity  
Singularly assigned to this emotional plane of isolation  
In temptation the devil tells me I'm owed a perfect incarnation  
He sells me a story of obsession and depraved possession  
A kingdom of pleasure ruled with love and aggression  
Where I, a small boy, need not suppress my self expression  
Coddled to the breasts of my best rendition of perfection  
Invaded without question through every orifice of impression  
Filled forcefully with the affection whose absence triggers my depression  
Arrested attention unable to wander toward fate's transgressions  
A trance of innocence floating toward the limitless  
I think of this and then glimpse my disconsolate reality  
A new death endured in the endless cycle of calamity  
To know the depth of beauty in potentiality  
Contrasted with this hideous nature of absurdist actuality  
Please let me find the courage to set myself free  
I beg you, in vain, in submission on my knees  
End my suffering in a silent, painless, merciful release.",26Feb2020,1
4,"I work at a doctor’s office, kind of like an assistant on days where we have patients. My boss is an asshole and doesn’t leave any room for human error from his staff. 

Yesterday, long story short, I didn’t see that this patient had already had a thoracic MRI done that my boss ordered, so I insisted that she hadn’t when my boss asked about it. She’s old so she didn’t know either. My boss told her to come back once she’s had that done. 

This morning, I decided to double check because it had been bothering me. Turns out it was just kind of hidden within her other imaging and she got it done almost 6 months ago. I freaked out and was like, omg! I’m dead! He’s firing me! And was stressing about it all morning. So I texted my boss this long apology (he was in surgery). He comes in today and he didn’t even care that I fucked up. He was just like, “oh yeah, I saw your text, just let me take a look at that MRI and I’ll give her a quick call.” No big deal. The patient didn’t care either.

At first I was like, why isn’t anyone mad at me??? And then I realized, I’m definitely my worst critic. I need to chill....",26Feb2020,1
6,"my mom straight up texted me that she doesn’t support how it’s on my forearm but I’m 18, and feel like I know what I want. I know it’ll be on me forever but I’m kinda a loner and want to say yolo more. I want to live life incase I die in a car crash or before I’m old. I want to actually live life and not waste it. I know that sounds dumb but it’s how I feel, and going through highschool alone has had an impact on it. now that I’m becoming older I want to do the things that I want to do and experience new things (not just the tattoo btw).

yes I want this tattoo on my forearm and many people are saying don’t Bc I can’t cover it up. If my career job doesn’t allow tattoos I’ll just say ‘I just see it as body art and I that I don’t want to work there’. I wouldn’t want to surround my self with the bad vibes or boring vibes if I’m trying to live life at its fullest. I want to be happy in life. I’d rather work at a lower paying job that’s fun and accepts me for the human I am, rather than lay in “riches” and be professional all the fricken time.

anyways I’ve always been guided and stuff through out my life and now my mom disagrees w something that’s about MY life.

7,"Everyday I go through the day and think about the end of it all. Been going on a while. I can’t shake it. This feeling of sadness and knowing there is ultimately no future is becoming my daily thought. I smile less, I laugh less, I do everything less. I have no joy and no happiness. Even when my kids are with me, it’s an act. I love them more than anything in the entire world and they are currently the only reason I’m still here but the feeling is waning. I’m not going to make it and ultimately I think it’s going to all end.",26Feb2020,1
8,"So I lost my voice today. I work with children with autism and I had an already horrible throat yesterday, and my morning client wasn’t behaving the best so I was having to use a somewhat loud voice quite a bit. I already anticipated I might lose my voice. And I did lose my voice this morning. I cannot do my job without my voice, so I stayed home. My voice is doing that thing where my voice lags a few seconds when I try to talk. So I just didn’t talk today. 

My husband works from home. So I have most of what I said to him in text and I thought reading it might be funny for some of you. None of it is sexual by the way, though it can kind of sound like it at some points. We had an issue with some water coming out near the sink from a dishwasher issue, for context...


The rug is wet under the sink well you know 

Then what was wet? Oh

It’s cold

Did you notice the water still happening when the dishwasher was still going

So it’s done now with w

9,"If I have money, then i just don't gamble, maybe every once in a while if I can spare the money but it is rare. but, whenever finances get tough and i get pretty broke, I just feel like gambling.

10,"1) I am not doing it for attention. Even if I were, that wouldn't make it any less valid. When they say someone is doing it for attention, they mean that they're silently asking for help. They want someone to ask if they're okay and encourage them to seek help, not oogle at their cuts and scars. 

2) It's not teenage hormones; It's depression. Even if it were hormones, why would that negate any reason to seek help? 

3) Please do not point them out unless you know me. If you do know me, please dont treat me like I'm crazy or act disgusted. That won't help anyone.

4) Also, don't point them out loudly or in public. Even if I'm wearing a t-shirt with my wrists slashed to ribbons, I definitely do not want you to broadcast or shine a light on my issues in front of others. Keep your thoughts to yourselves.

5) No, self harm is not exclusively done by teenagers. Adults self harm, and that is 1,000% valid. Don't demean me for never learning any healthy coping mechanisms when I never had the chance.

6) I know it hurts to hear this, but even if you mean a lot to me, you don't have the power to change me in a week. One conversation won't help. This does NOT mean I love you any less, or that you are any less important to me. Self harm is just so hard to deal with on so many levels. It can take years to stop. Please be patient with me.

7) Positive reinforcement goes a lot further than negative reinforcement. You could threaten to leave me or take stuff away, and I'd still find myself with new cuts that very night. However, when you praise me for a week, a month, a year clean? It makes me feel like I can do it.

8) Please don't play mind games with me. Don't guilt trip me. Don't tell me, ""How would you feel if I did that!?"" It will only make me feel worse and more likely to cut. I can't believe anyone would think that this would make me stop. (Please refer to point 6 if you still don't understand.)

9) Self harmers are desperate. If you take away my blades, I'll use my nails. If you start to check my body, I'll cut beneath my bra and under my feet so you won't see. If you threaten me in any way, I will still cut. Don't think for one moment that this physical addiction is anything that can be stopped at the drop of a hat.

10) ""Have you tried coloring? Happy music? Talking to someone? Maybe watching a funny show? Maybe marking your skin with a red pen?"" Okay, let's get one thing straight: self harm gives you tunnel vision. It often feels like my only option, and sometimes my depression is so severe that nothing in that moment makes me feel happy. Don't give me generic alternatives you know will only delay the inevitable. Being a self harmer takes strength on my part to quit, but giving half-assed suggestions is not going to help me. I find that talking with someone helps a lot more than ""happy music.""

These are just some things that have weighed on me for the past few years. If anyone has any more points, feel free to add them to my list!",26Feb2020,1
11,"**TW: Depression, Self Harm, Mentions of Suicide**

I'm so frightened that I'm falling into another pit of depression and anxiety again and I hate it. I'm officially (not online quizzes or WebMD self diagnosed) diagnosed with clinical depression alongside other issues that I don't really want to mention because I don't really think it's necessary or come across as an attention seeker or anything.

I was on my way home today and I saw my reflection in the bus window and felt disgusted. The way I was sat- hunched over, biting my sleeve, shaking. It's like seeing someone who you really hate, someone you've fallen out with and aren't friends with anymore- but it's you. 

I look so ugly. I don't have many friends but they don't even reassure me when I say I look or feel ugly. It makes me so scared of meeting people or even just going outside because I don't want the first thing people think of me to be 'wow, she's ugly as hell'. I was always the person who was asked out as a joke. I would pull any different facial expression other than neutral and people would snicker and laugh at me as if I looked so odd compared to a 'normal' person. I still get it when groups of boys walk past me and say 'she's well fit her' then start laughing at me as they walk away. I don't really have anything physically that makes me look different- I'm just fucking ugly. 

I feel like I'm doing an awful job at work because I just seem to suck at everything. I feel like I'm not wanted there even though I'm doing something I've always wanted to do. I'm never told I'm doing a good job at anything and I feel like I'm just being looked down upon as a child and I'll never be as good at the job as my employer. I'm trying so hard though. I don't know if it's something I want to do anymore or if I just feel that way because I feel like everyone there dislikes me. I don't know if I'm being paranoid or if it is the case... I just don't know.

Recently I built up so much confidence- I found myself being able to take part in conversations and initiate them, but today I couldn't even bring myself to talk to my friends. I just wanted to be alone and out of sight, where I couldn't bother anyone and nobody could bother me. I haven't felt that way in a long time and I've worked immensely hard to get to where I am/was. I really don't want to slip again. High school was super rough, I was really struggling with my depression because of bullying (of course) and other issues and one night I tried to do something dumb and I didn't want anyone to know apart from my family (who had found me) or my close friend, who ended up telling people, then nearly everyone found out. My suicide note was sent to my old 'friendship group' by this person and they took it apart like they were in an English class and said I was attention seeking.   

I had an issue with self harm and even when I wasn't feeling depressed I would still do it just because I felt I needed to. Even after all my counselling/CBT/exposure therapy sessions, I'd still feel the urge to do it because I guess it was just a comfort. I hate it though and I'm so scared of doing it again. The urge gets so strong and it's so hard to take my mind of it but there's no one I can talk to about it. My friends don't really know much about it because I don't want to be that person who just talks about being 'sick' or whatever. I don't want people to think I'm attention seeking. I couldn't even bring it up to my counsellor because it made me so anxious. 

I don't feel like I'm worthy of anyone's company. I feel like a huge burden at my job after finding out my employer didn't even want to take me on. My body is telling me that this isn't the right thing for me to be doing because as much as I'm trying to enjoy it I'm drained, I'm vacant and as much as I hate to admit it it's making me insecure and anxious. The little willpower I have left is telling me to just get it done, to stick with it and see where I end up. I don't want to spend years of my life here if I'm going to revert to practically never talking to anyone, isolating myself whenever I can and losing my spark. I feel like there's a small chance I'll settle in and relax a little more again, but I've been trying to convince myself this for months now.

I'm just tired of me. I'm tired of this person who can't do anything without feeling stupid or embarrassed. Hell- I'm even embarrassed to walk down the street because I'm scared of people judging me. Certain lights and sounds are irritating me and sending me into panic mode fro no seemingly good reason again and it just comes across as really weird and needy because I can't listen to certain things or I need the lights turning down or I cover my ears like a kid.

I'm sorry if this really dragged on or if it sounded like a pity party, I'm really not trying to use this to get sympathy I just want to feel like I'm talking to someone about it all. I don't really have anywhere else to release these feelings without people I don't like finding me and ripping into me because of it, and I don't want people I know to know I feel like this. It's making me so anxious to post this but I want to build up my confidence again and get back to where I was, I want to put myself out there, even if no one knows who this is. I want to get the feelings out of me. I don't expect comments or anything but any advice or words of wisdom that isn't just 'go get help' or 'go to therapy' are appreciated. I may end up deleting this but posting it is a huge achievement to me, even if just for a little while. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this if you did, it means more to me than you could know, and I hope if you too are struggling, you manage to find your feet again and keep going, because I didn't think I was going to make it but I'm here and I know that even though things seem rough right now that I'm going to keep going, so stay strong &lt;3",26Feb2020,1

Through elementary and middle school, AND high school I would say things to people whenever i got pissed off at them for them being a bitch. I just today called this girl a slut and a whore. It was very wrong despite the fact she gossips about me and had sex with someone else in the eighth grade, and she dresses like a slut, and she makes fun of me for being in the LGBTQ community. Whenever anyone pisses me off i go off at them telling them to fuck off and just, ugh! I hate myself as well because people make me feel like shit. I feel so guilty even if I didn’t even start this shit. I can’t even tell anyone because i am not fully out as pansexual and i am not fully innocent. Everyone just seems to piss me off and make me cry, and I don’t know if it’s hormones or me being emotional because it’s just a trait i have. I want my false reputation to go away and i want people to like me! People make up dumb rumors about me and i’m sick of it! I hate my life at this point and the only thing that i can redeem myself with is my singing voice and ability to draw kinda sorta well..",26Feb2020,1
26,"It's no secret that the Reddit admin's are incredibly liberal. There's talk of people discussing how they're going to bounce once the final nail in T_D's coffin gets hammered into place. I've seen this multiple times. First with FatPeopleHate, then with CringeAnarchy, now T_D is going through the exact same thing.

Many users expect a large part of reddit to leave with them, and that just isn't going to happen. Because while it's true that most of the mods, admins, and even the CEO are far left, so is the userbase. When the ""edgy"" subs got banned, they made their own communities. And guess what happened since these communities were exclusively populated by edgelords? The community was very edgy. You can replace edgy with ""conservative"" and you'll have the same thing. Now consider this: You'll be leaving because this site is overbearingly liberal and suffocating any conservative community that forms. Why would the liberal or politically neutral populace of reddit go to your newly formed overbearingly conservative community?

It's not going to happen. And your average redditor isn't going to visit two websites to get their news. I want to read about warhammer. I'm not going to go visit ""republeddit"" or whatever you call it to read the warhammer news there, most of it is going to be here, on reddit. And while I think the actions of the CEO and admins are abhorrent, I don't care enough to gimp myself by not using this incredible resource. Your average redditor is not going to make the change either. Your average redditor probably enjoys the unjust treatment that conservatives get on this website. And that's really the main problem.

When you're as far left as most of these people are, anything even remotely conservative looks unspeakably evil. Admins are removing posts that use the word ""tranny."" Admins target posts that have negative views of islam. These are not outrageous ideas. These are not ""alt-right"" terrorists in the making. Having an unfavorable view of trans people or islam is completely mundane, and can be reasonably rationalized. But if you're miles away from center, all you're reading right now is me defending ""bigotry."" And I didn't even say that I hold those views. All I said was that someone can reasonably defend either of those positions.

There won't be a mass-exodus because most of the users are happy here. They're happy with the orwellian treatment that conservatives get on this site. They think they're battling evil, they are unironically proud keyboard warriors. The admins are not going to get a change of heart either. They banned r/Mr_Trump for ""ban evasion."" It was not. By no stretch of the imagination was that subreddit ""ban evasion."" You literally could not even make comments. It was purely for posting memes. The list is endless. Right now T_D is quarantined. You CANNOT see the posts from T_D unless you explicitly go there, and admins are still changing the SITE-WIDE rules just to fuck with them some more. They're trying to get as close to outright banning conservatives as possible without explicitly doing so. And once they do, the site as a whole won't change much. The average user can't even see conservative content here unless they go looking for it specifically. And even then, it's omitted from search results (this may have changed, I don't know for sure but it used to be.) When T_D is banned the average user won't even notice, because most of them didn't know it was there to begin with.

If you want proof just check out the vitriolic comments on this post snarkily saying they're glad ""my people"" and their hate will be gone. And the sarcasm, gotta love the sarcasm.",26Feb2020,1

[Text below is copypasta'd from my post in r/samsung]

Even I have a Samsung from the Middle Ages (i.e the era of Plain White Samsungs like mine) I'm still proud of being among a great brand (and because my parents owned (pretty much) newer Samsungs (2019 Samsungs (Note 9 &amp; Tab A 8.0 w/ S-Pen respectively if you ask me) ).

In school I've been debating with two classmates who uses an iPhone and a Huawei respectively. They've been boastung about their lack of 5G is good for my country that has very few places using 5G in my country (Malaysia). I mean, 5G phones can do fallbacks to lower-Gs, amirite?

Camera zoom levels and picture quality, S-Pen practicality and even the Note 7 fiasco that already passed by quite a long time ago (and there's a lot of I need to take out just to keep up with their unfair 'scoring system' that just doesn't register the Pros I've been handing in to them. What goes up is theirs). Even they've been talking yrash about my almost-6 y.o Grand Prime that has lots of damage (but still can be used like normal, I'll share a pic of mine later) (incl. rather occassional freezing, screen blacking out, loose SIM holder, even a slow cellular line). I mean, theirs are worse in most regards if not all anyway.

We exchange money and I'm watching him closely because, ya know. Safety.

We exchange money and he starts to leave. I check, all 4 quarters are there. I'm at a bar. With pool tables. I have exactly 4 quarters and 1 dollar bill in my pocket, so I say, ""You got 4 more quarters?""

35,"I’ve had many people tell me that I’m so easy to get along with, and how I’m their only friend they’ve never had a fight with.

Well, it’s not that I’m necessarily that nice, I just hate conflict. I’ll gladly argue about something academic or philosophical. Joke arguments are cool too. But 9 times out of 10 I’ll back down from anything emotional. 

The other 10% is with random people I have no connection with. I don’t have a problem calling random people out if they’re being dicks, but never my friends, because I don’t want to start something with someone I care about.

Even when someone directly asks for my opinion, I give it in the most neutral way possible.

Occasionally I’ll accidentally end up in either a real argument or simply a heated conversation. If it’s in person, I’ll dismiss it - “[my opinion] but whatever” or “it doesn’t matter anyway” or just change the subject. If it’s online, I’ll either change the subject or send a cute animal picture (it always works, lol).

I used to think this was all good and very normal. Then more people started telling me I’m the only person they’ve never fought with, and I thought about it and realized how direct and open most people are.

During this fantasy, Yiruma's River Flows In You began playing in my head and I havent heard that song in a year, so I searched it up after my feelings died down. That song gives me sexual feelings every time I hear it too.

Sometimes the soft Minecraft music would play in my head, or Pachelbel's Canon in D. Or any other soft piano piece I remember. This happened since I had my very first rudimentary sensual fantasies at age eleven. 

I don't even play Minecraft or listen to that much classical piano music as often as I listen to funk, soul and hip-hop, but it sneaks in my head when I am very horny and it drowns out any other noise. 

I wonder if this phenomenon happens to other people. I always liked piano melodies, but it just happens to drown out everything else when I feel very aroused.",26Feb2020,1
41,"I don't know how to let go of the mistakes I have made. When I lost my virginity, I basically gave it to a random person I barely knew. I now realize that virginity isn't everything it's made out to be, but I continue to be affected by my decision. The next time I had sex, I had sex with someone who I knew deep down (though I refused to admit it at the time) did not care about me at all. It continued to happen through out the years until it became a pattern. The people I was having sex with would use me and then fade out. But, I always put myself in those situations. I'm not trying to place blame on anyone but myself. Eventually I went to therapy, and I was told that this behavior was  related to the PTSD issues that I had gone to therapy for once before. Long story short, one of my parents was abusive, and it messed me up, but this explanation has never resonated with me. 

I never understood the correlation between the trauma I experienced growing up and me letting myself get used by these random guys. All the people I have slept with gave me the impression that a long term relationship would result from me sleeping with them---very dysfunctional. That never happened of course. This past summer I started focusing a lot on myself, and I started changing the way I viewed...well....myself...and by changing my thoughts, I changed my behavior. 

As of right now, I am beyond blessed to be with someone who values me and loves me. I am not the same person from before, but I feel so much discomfort when I think about the person I used to be and the decisions I used to make. I slut shame myself nearly every day, and it's not something I feel like I can talk about with anyone. I wish there was a way to delete all of my mistakes and the person I used to be, but I can't.

I’m quite an introverted person and shy as well and I try to avoid conflict in every way I can. Basically, I’ve had problems with this girl that everybody I talk to dislikes for a few years now. We have not talked in a long time and simply ignore each other, we do have to see each other 3-4 times a week though. She confronted me the other day about an issue I never caused and began to yell very loudly, even though she was wrong, so I shut her down because in this case it was necessary since she was creating a huge scene in front of all my friends and even random strangers. She started crying after and all her friends were comforting her even though she caused the whole situation.

Now she’s telling everybody that I caused the problem and I am spreading rumours about her even though I have NO idea what she is talking about. All my friends are confused as well and know her pretty well.

I don’t know what to do about these rumours she’s pressing. I can’t confront her in person because I know I’ll get flustered and start crying by her yelling if this were to happen again, and I can’t message her online because we have each other blocked.

47,"Let me tell you something about me. I haven't been very accepting with my broken dreams lately.

Bad days are those that would consume my existence for a whole day or consecutive days with a calm approach. These days are the silent trips filled with thoughts rushing from my temple to the tiniest branch of nerves in my brain. This consciousness is lonely but it whispers to me the most interesting of things. How is this bad, you ask? Well, it is the frustration that comes along with it. The frustration of forcing these bursting ideas into hiding because of fear that ignorants and bigots will enclose me altogether with their suffocating morals. And if there is something I hate, it is arguing with people with locked point of views. If I'd  let them take a peek in my thoughts, they'd probably burn me at a stake. So, I chose silence. I chose to confide with pen and paper, keyboard and screens, continuously flourishing my insanity.

Worse moments on the other hand, are the unexpected breakdowns. It is still frustration that causes it, but this time, with myself. My incapability of doing the things I truly wish to do in a place I've been dreaming to exist in. The visuals I see after I close my eyes scream helplessness and lost of control with my entirety. 
With all honesty, I am ungrateful. I do not want what I have, and the things that I want are now past its time. Would you ever understand if I'd tell you how painful it is to be aware that I am just emptily floating around this modernity and chasing around opportunities for nothing else but money? Yes. Money. It's  been long ago since I lost my faith in happiness because, no, we are not made to be happy. Not anymore. 

This could be why I always try to identify what I want and don't want. Fools me into believing I'm still in control when all I've been actually doing is follow the buzz of a typical mediocre existence. 
Who knew mediocrity could be this crippling? Hehe I didn't  know until recently, I found myself crying hard, but silently, in a bus full of people. My thoughts are everywhere, I was unable to exact the cause of that embarassing break down. Was it the cold breath of the wind? Was it that stupid decision I made a week ago? Or is it the song I'm hearing from my headphones? I do not know.

So we almost broke up last New Year Eve, but for some reasons my dumb ass agreed to make it up and now every moment I spend with her feels compulsory and draining.

I couldn’t tell her because that probably would cause some major problem and I’d rather deal with it myself than to deal with her. But recently she just keeps attacking me, judging my decision to save up for a nintendo switch, an intuos wacom, saying what am I doing it for and that I’m not rich like our other friend, that I always spend my money relentlessly (yah but now I’m genuinely trying to save up some cash duh), of course I tried to stand my statement but apparently that upset her and wouldn’t talk to me until today, when she called upon me (again) and attacking my act of printing paper, and while I was just trying to say, that it’d be easier for me to do work on paper (my dumb ass cannot learn by typing, I’m sorry) and it requires a lot of drawing and stuff, she hung up on me again, after a long pause of silence and I was trying to fix the conversation by talking about the cute game I’m currently playing.

So, my ex boyfriend broke up with me about a month ago. The break-up was amicable and kind of mutual. We were in a dead relationship, there was resentment, and we (tbh mainly he) weren't growing as people. We've managed to remain good friends, which is bomb because I do still love him as a friend and most of the best parts of how we operate are as friends. Hell we've kind of low key played wing-person for each other and bounced off each other for dating advice, which is fucking fab. 
However, it's been 5 years since I've been out there, and a lot has changed. And I'm still insecure about some things. Like talking, I'm a terrible texter. I'm super awkward, way over think things and I have a habit of momentary ghosting when I get tired or busy. I'm worried about driving girls off or making them think I'm uninterested when honestly I'm probably just napping or frying my brain because *a cute girl actually wants to talk to me like-wow-holy-fucking-shitballs* . 
I'm also insecure about finding love again. I don't want another Ex and I relationship, I want something new and better... But it's mind boggling to me that maybe something will come along that'll be love.  With the love I had before I was lucky enough that it kind of fell into my lap.

I know the kind of behaviors that tick him off. I'm as permissive as a welcoming mat, and while I have never cheated on him (and never will)- I often engage in behavior I know will fan his jealousy, because I'm spineless. He isn't unreasonable. If a person doesn't seem to respect the boundaries of our relationship, he expects me to stand up to them and/or cease contact. 

I've been pretty flaky about this, often prioritizing my perceived popularity over his emotional well-being, not telling people to back off, because I fear upsetting them. This often leads me to lead on people I have no interest in while hurting my own relationship- Again, I'm stupidly submissive and spineless for the sake of being liked.

I realize most of these people are irrelevant.

It really bothers me that some people don't return respect with respect and take it for granted until you let them know they can't mess around with you. 

I mean we all read books, watch tv and get educated how to be respectful, humane, mindful of others but anyway from generation to generation for almost 11000 years kids grow up and behave this way which leads to bullying, humiliation, making fun of, fighting for dominance etc etc. Are we still so primal and primate-like that we cant control our idiotic animal impulses and take being nice as being weak? 

With all the civil rights and ethics advancement it really saddens me that informally, people still revolve the societal norms around our worst behaviors: ""u have to be tough because there are bad people"", ""u have to be uncaring because if u care too much people will run over you"", ""you have to be able to stand up for yourself"". And oft times those guys who are criminals and mob bosses get revered and treated with respect and some adoration. Why the fuck would you respect and adore a person who humiliates others and takes away from people who are weaker and cares only about himself only? 


And some girls madly falling in love with guys who just have dominance in society regardless of his treatment of other weaker people. ""He rapes, plunders, humiliates others? Not a problem, as long as i stay with him i will have safety and certain priveleges and have whatever i want"" Is that what these girls and women who stay with ""bad boys"" think?

I applied for several jobs related to bachelor's (computer science) degree. Most of the times I never attended interview and one time I declined the offer. I tried hard to get out of the situation and also succeed for several times those lasted for short term. But It again and again came back more effectively. So it's been on and off (mostly on) for 3 years now. And I'm finding myself in this never ending repetitive cycle and that's fucking exhausting.

I think I'm reaching to my end point. I know sooner or later I will have to decide to plan my exit from here. I can't imagine going on the way I'm going (or any other way) for another 30 to 40 years. It seems too fucking long. I have to cut it short. Mainly I consider all this is because of Existential Depression.

I don't want to leave my parents in a shock though. And I also want them to understand why must I need to take such a big step. I have imagined hundred times in my mind that how I will make them understand my situation and let them know my plan. But I don't know somehow I never dared to initiate the conversation. Maybe because I'm afraid that that'll put them in a hellish of a situation that I'm in right now. I don't want to spread this fucking thing. 

Also I can't imagine myself leaving this world without them knowing it. I'm stuck. I can't seem to live here anymore. And can't seem to inform my parents about my leaving and that makes me keep on living.

Dear reader, I need help. How should a person converse their decision to quit to their parents?",26Feb2020,1
71,"Come on, just give me a break, I just need an out. This can’t be life, what did my ancestors do to make this my life??? What type of karma is this?

I’ve never been a very happy camper as far as I can remember, but the fact that the WORST of everything that could happen to me HAS happened to me has taken the entire cake and the tray. Just this past week let me tell you I’ve lost my boyfriend, I’ve lost my job, I’ve lost my apartment because my roommate spontaneously moved out on me and I can’t afford the crap on my own, I lost my car to a wreck that happened when I WAS NOT EVEN IN THE CAR, I got an eye infection, and I got in a HUGE fight with my family.

Holy hell, just let me die already! It’s all I ask, I don’t care anymore! Don’t tell me “things will get better” because this WAS supposed to be “things getting better” and it all crashes down on me in a matter of SIX DAYS! Therapy is trash, medication is trash, drinking the pain away is trash, EVERYTHING IS TRASH!!!! Like, I’m sorry did I murder someone and somehow completely forget about it and I’m just receiving my karma for it? NOTHING is worth enough to continue on. No amount of money, no job, no man, no kid, nothing that could possibly “turn around” in my life is worth this mediocre piece of trash that is life.",26Feb2020,1

77,"My partner and I live together and have been together for almost two years. For about half of that we have been having some trouble, mostly with him saying hurtful things to me, or telling silly lies or doing things I feel are disrespectful. 

A few examples. I really wanted to live together after 10 months and he wasn’t sure. I got a bit upset once and basically a few weeks later he said we should live together. Months later he told me “I only asked you to move in because I couldn’t handle you getting upset all the time about it or nagging” my heart dropped. He lied to me and said he wouldn’t give his friends his medication as a party drug then gave them to our housemates on NYE. 

The thing that really did it happened recently. I found out that a “friend” of mine and a close friend of his (30f) told him early on that he should “be careful” of me despite that fact that I cooked her dinner and have spoken to her about her mental health a number of times so I thought we were friends. Apparently she’s also said I’m “fake” because I have quite a few followers on Instagram and that she doesn’t enjoy talking with me. I had a feeling she might like my boyfriend. Then I found out he had been speaking badly of me to her. This has been going on for months. He lied and told me she likes me and we should be friends, he invited me to her birthday dinner when I wasn’t invited and told me I was, and then last week invited her to our party at our house and this whole time (almost two years) I’ve thought she was my friend. 

I feel so betrayed and stupid and upset. I stormed out of the house and said it’s over and it’s just been too much hurt and I can’t take it anymore. I already miss him but I also am so sick of all the pain. I feel like your partner is meant to stand up for you. He didn’t.

I usually go to this natural park in my city, and I see all of these things over there. Groups of guys listening to music, girls playing cards, groups of girls and guys together playing games, couples, and so on.

I don't have depression, nor do I struggle with making ""friends"" (I'm not sure if I can call them friends due to how I feel/don't feel about them). People who know me in person don't know I feel this way.

I feel like I'm just watching life. I don't feel like I'm part of the group, I don't feel like I'm ""one of them.""

I can engage in as many activities as I want. I can play games with people, go to parties with them, but these activities don't make me feel much of anything. I do feel good when I'm the center of attention, but that's just sometimes. It depends on how I'm getting their attention. I don't enjoy that for too long.

When I'm in a group, my mind is just focusing on the things people do...just taking everything in. I take the good parts and make them part of my ""personality"" so that people think I'm forming a bond with them. In truth, it's kinda like being blind your entire life and then learning to describe what something looks like. You can't really see. You just do a good enough job of pretending you do.

I'm not present when people tell me things. I am unable to feel for their achievements and losses. When I start talking to someone, I always have a set goal, and their emotional bits are the challenge. I don't understand them.

86,"I decided to do a bit of a challenge for myself since I was already losing weight. I wanted to healthily reach the tip (but not at) of what is considered underweight. I managed to reach 144 pounds at 6 foot 3 (male, 26). 

During this weight loss, starting at about when I was 180, people were telling me I was getting too skinny and were worried. 

Anyways, I decided I'd have a cheat day (which turned into a cheat couple of days..) and during then NO ONE WAS WORRIED??? 

I guess I'm kind of mad at the hypocrisy? I used to eat a lot because I wasn't there mentally, no one saw that and they kept bringing me food. I remember one day I got a whole pizza for my birthday. One day I ate a whole pizza for lunch at work, no one told me I should stop eating. I feel like they should, idk? 

I guess it makes sense, they want to know I'm eating well, but that doesn't mean I'm doing well. 

Anyways, I figured the cheat day would turn into cheat couple of days so I'm not too worried about gaining weight again (currently on water retention mode, so staying hydrated), I'm just ready to get back to losing! This is just a thought I had over the weekend. 

I kind of got mad at my mom and made her leave the car because she would kept bugging me to eat more and more during the weight loss and I finally decided to spend the night before my sister's wedding enjoying food with her and she ends up giving me a look of disproval because I'm eating so much so quickly, but only because they wanted to leave already and I wanted to enjoy the food.

93,"Earlier this week, I got completely blindsided by my girlfriend of less than 6 months(but had really strong feelings for) dumping me because she had a lot of unresolved trauma from her childhood that she needed to resolve, even though she said I’m the “sweetest person ever” and liked me probably more than any other guy she’s been with so far in her life, but said it would be “unfair to drag me down with her” and needed to sort herself out before she could be in a serious relationship with anyone again. 

Before that, I dated someone for a few months who ended things because of mental health issues from her sister’s suicide a year prior. A week before she ended things, she had told me how glad she was that she met me and made her happier.

After her I was with someone briefly who had a chronic disease(won’t go into too much detail what it is) who started getting more and more sick and told me she had to end things because that would be unfair to me. Less than a week before that she said she felt a strong connection with me and really trusted me. 

In addition to this, I had an ex from a couple years ago who unexpected try to come back into my life at one point before she ends up moving to a completely different country for a few years. 

Having all this happen in a relatively short time has caused me to crumble all week emotionally, to where a 27 year old man like myself was crying on the drive back home from work, and crying to his parents on the phone earlier this week. And right now, I’m too scared to date for a while because of so many high hopes that keep crashing down.

First, I'd like to ask why don't people follow their own god\*\*\*\* advice? Sorry for the language I'm just sick and tired of people telling you to do one thing and then turning around and doing the exact opposite. For example, I'm shy and introverted, but lately I've really been wanting to get out there and make friends since I don't really have that many. I even want to find a girl I can date. But when I ask for advice the most common answer I get is ""Oh, just go out there and be social. Just be yourself and approach people."" I would be fine with this if people actually did that themselves, but they don't. I've maybe had 1 or 2 people in my 21 years of living on this planet approach me. (This is in social settings where you're kinda expected to meet new people.) They all just hide out in their little exclusive alcoves and enclaves.

As far as girls go, it seems like almost all girls my age want noticeably older men or tall athletic handsome types. While I am tall (I'm 6'0) and if I consistently exercised I would be athletic (I weigh 155 lbs) but I'm not handsome. I've been rated on [r/rateme](https://www.reddit.com/r/rateme/) a low of 5.5 and a high of 7.5. I know I sound very antagonistic, especially towards women, but nothing could be further from the truth. I'm all for women's rights, women in the workplace, equal pay, lgbtq liberties etc. I just want a beautiful girl to hold and squeeze and whisper to at night and who I can treat both in and out of the bedroom. I'm just so tired and discouraged because it seems like all the girls I like are ""way out of my league"" and I'm not attracted to ""girls in my league.""

I'm just sick and tired of all the lies and deception and mental games of people. I truly want to do better for myself and make friends and eventually find a nice beautiful woman who I can love for who she is inside and out and who can love me for who I am inside and out.

110,"I haven’t posted using this throwaway account since the first time over six years ago. My wife had a miscarriage in our bathroom and I was confused, shocked, and experiencing a new flavor of sadness that was really fucking me up.  I put it all in a self-indulgent post to r/daddit and sent it off, hoping only to feel the immediate, therapeutic benefit of putting it into words. I had always heard that works. I think it definitely helped. And the comments I got in response were helping  me to make sense of a senseless situation. 

I forgot about this throwaway until just now, when I find myself in what feels like another pit of confusion, sadness, worry, and fear. It’s been 8 months in the making, and my family has been through the ringer. We feel like we can see the light at the end of the tunnel, but every time we think we’re getting close to the end the universe says “fuck you” and moves the the light a few miles further down the road. and now its getting to be too much. I’m so tired of being sad, scared and scared of upcoming sadness. And none of this is happening directly to me. 

In June, my mother went into the hospital. She had diverticulitis, and was dehydrated and overheated in her apartment. I found out during the setbreak at a Phish show that she had been taken to the ER and had a seizure while there. The fun day I had been anticipating for months ended abruptly, and changed into the beginning of a dull, persisitent wakkng nightmare. Then she developed pneumonia 2 days later. I thought that was going to be it. When a 73 year old with a host of other medical issues contracts pneumonia in the hospital, the odds are never good. But she kicked the pneumonia in 3 days and, by October, she was discharged and had gone through extensive inpatient rehab, and was back in her apartment. 

Also in October, my wife had an abnormal pap smear. By Novemeber we had learned there was a 4cm tumor on her cervix. A hysterectomy was attempted, but the tumor’s position required then to change the treatment plan. She went through 6 weeks of radiation and chemo, and it was the hardest thing she ever did...but it wasn’t physically unbearable and she didnt lose her hair. She made it through, and that ended last week. But we’ll come back to that. 
   
Between the diagnosis and the attempted surgery, my step mother called to say my father had been admitted to the hospital. Earlier that day he passed out, vomited and had no discernable pulse. He’s bounced back quickly with no incidents since. But it became evident to me that when something serious does happen to him, I’m in for a flood of issues I’ve never addressed that will arise from our complicated relationship. 

 During this whole time, my sister was going through a comlicated pregnancy. She had her own issues, but the baby was in serious trouble. He had 2 serious heart defects, and would require open heart surgery as a newborn, and a second surgery at 4-6 months. He was born in a sepcialized hospital on my birthday. He remained there for over 2 months. They finally took him home last week. On Friday morning he stopped breathing and died. A frantic call from ny sister at 6 am, followed by immeasurable sadness like my family has never known. The first time I had seen him in person, and he was already gone. My wife and I held their dead baby. She wanted us to. She and my brother in law had been through so much already, and now their baby was gone. They have so much sadness ahead of them. 

We’re reeling from this. Consoling my 5 year old daughter. She loves babies more than anything. Wondering if my 8 year old son is going atrempt to process it or just keep pretending hes not sad. Wondering if my kid’s winter cough is the really the just universe somehow winding up to kick us in the face again. A fight yesterday with my wife because she’s stressed and now talkng me off a ledge again. Preparing for services starting tomorrow that are going to tear out hearts out. 

  Then my wife calls me crying this morning just as I get to work. Her chemo doctor wants to take advantage of her relative youth and good health and do another regimen of 4 chemo treatments, and hopefully bolster her chances of becoming and remaining cancer free. Only this time, her hair *will* fall out. The side effects will be more severe. More drugs. And now the light’s been pushed further away. 

Fuck. 
My sister is so hurt. 
My wife is so exhausted in every possible way. 
I can’t do anything about any of it. 
My own birthday will forever remind my entire exrended family of the saddest thing we’ve ever experienced. *And* they’re all worried about my wife’s health, as well.

To people from the UK, it may seem strange that an American is so interested in your culture, but you guys need to understand that we Americans have totally forgotten where we came from, and it's very important to many of us.",26Feb2020,1
114,"Every fucking time I’m with this guy, in the beginning it’s so good and nice and then I go insane. I felt like I was going fucking insane. So I broke things off and ended up taking him back because I just love him so much but I fucking feel psycho being with him. I don’t want to put all the blame on him and who knows maybe I am just a bad person to be with but I swear he brings out the worst in me, he also has brought out the best but I guess maybe the universe needs to balance it out. I feel insane i feel so insane. I stalk him everyday on social media so carefully, going through every single person that’s recently followed him, I spend hours going through likes that were from years ago and go through every single account looking through each girl. I go crazy, I keep trying to find out who he’s had sex with, I have this painful hatred for all the girls who have ever interacted with him. I watch him to see if he’s messaged anybody else , you can check scores on snapchat each time you send a message and I keep track, tallying it down.

Fuck I feel like a fucking psycho. I can’t do this. I can’t keep stalking every fucking girl who likes his shit or follows him or friends him. I can’t harass people who I have a strong intuition he might’ve done something with in the past without any concrete evidence. I just feel insane when I’m with him. Everything seems so dark when I’m with him. I’ve never been consumed and filled with so much hatred, so much anger before. He makes me go crazy, he makes me want to track down every single person he’s ever been with. He makes me think of dark things that no one should ever think of. This hatred runs so deep. I just feel crazy, I feel so fucking crazy. I’ve been trying to track where he’s been going, what he’s been doing. I just don’t know if I can live like this. But I can’t live without him. But I can’t kill myself. What do I do... wait it out until I finally die. Why does this love feel so dark and cold..

I just want him in my life, fully, I just want him to fully want to be with me, to love me, to want me. He doesn’t want that... and I just can’t let go of him. I’m nothing without him",26Feb2020,1

118,"I wanted to be a teacher but I flunked out of my program because I barely passed my classes. I graduated with a B.S in interdisciplinary sciences with a pathetic GPA. I've been working a shitty retail job for fucking ever because that's like all my idiot brain can fucking handle.

 I went back to school to get my medical coding certification and I can't get a fucking job anywhere because spent too much time wasting my life in retail and don't have any experience. I've since given up looking for a medical coding position and I've been looking at job boards and nothing interests me at all. I just want a job that affords me a small apartment, health insurance and a little bit of money to play with. I have no idea what to do.

121,"I might just be riding an emotional high but here we go.

My girlfriend of 5 years broke up about a month ago and I'm really happy. The first week was hard. I wanted her back so F*cking bad. But the more I dwelled on it the more I realized our relationship was garbage. She treated me like garbage and honestly I gave her the world. I took her on romantic trips. I took her to Disney. I gave her money. I held her when she was having a bad day. I listened to how she felt when she was upset. I apologized to her if I upset her in any way. 

I'm not innocent. Because of trauma in my past I have trouble sharing my feelings, admitting when I'm upset, and basically have a hard time standing up for myself. 

As the years went on I told myself ""if things don't get better I'm going to break up with her in (insert month here)"". 

I was so depressed by the end of it that I realized I didn't know who I was or who I turned into. Before our relationship I felt strong. I was working out and honestly if I wanna be a little cocky I looked really good. But since the start of that relationship I've gained 30lbs. 

But now I I'm active again. I've reconnect with my friends who I havent talked to in years like we haven't even skipped a beat. I've stopped bad habits like locking myself in my room after a rough day of work and I find myself laughing so much. 

I missed myself. And I'm happy I feel like I'm back.",26Feb2020,1
124,"Since this week started I have been feeling emotionally down and almost cried in public several times because I can’t stop thinking about how I have zero friends other than my parents. I pretty much spend time with them everyday when I’m home after college and also on the weekends. 
Gosh,I’m so pathetic, I’m 23 ffs. I’m way too dependent on them , I can’t even handle my responsibilities. I keep screwing up everything I do, I have no friends and honestly sometimes I hate myself and I feel bad for my parents. 
What’s worst is they’re flying off tomorrow for 5 months to work. 

Please tell me I’ll be okay, 5 months isn’t that long right? 
Sorry if this post is a bit inconsistent and looks like it’s typed by a 12 year old child, like the title said , I need to grow up, be independent and suck it up. It’s just that I always get depressed thinking how lonely I’m going to be once they’re gone. Typing this post made my eyes wet and crying when I’m in college in front of other students who have their shit together is hella embarrassing.",26Feb2020,1

Thing was , was that she came from another state so it was a limited experience. So we kept in touch for a couple of months through social media and the more i got to know her the more i liked her. We shared a lot of similarities and was probably the only person ive met in my life at the time that had similar music tastes as well. Long story short, i eventually quit social media  and lost all contact with , which was the only thing that kept me on social media. I was sad for a while, but this last few months ive become way happier without social media and i realized that ive been loved by my family and that i finally got what i wished for, which was to never fall for another person ever again. Ive had no interest in finding a partner for a while now and im extremely happy , because i also realized that the love of my life has always been with me, which is music.",26Feb2020,1

DARKNESS

By ;-;

Slowly but surely the great unknown within the heart

The darkness that is building up

Filling in the space that has nothing left

Lurking there until it finds its way out

Destroying, craving, and wanting more than to say still

The more it grows that harder it becomes to contain it

Wishing for the darkness to disappear and go away

But before it be known you have been consumed

The darkness within is now out

Regretting that it leaked, regretting that it escaped

Hoping that it will never come out again 

And stays in the shadows of the heart

But at the same time feeling excited

Feeling relieved that what was said and done

As if a weight was lifted off the shoulders

Anxiously waiting for more to come out

Seeing what havoc it will cause next

What emotions, words, actions will spew out

Only to stop

After it was all said and done

Was it worth it?",26Feb2020,1
133,"I will call myself ""M"" or ""JM"" for the entirety of this. Others in my life will be referred to by their first and last initials (for example, John Smith would be ""JS""). 

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently a 32 year old human male with a diagnosis of Schizoaffective Disorder Depressive Type, Major Depressive Disorder, and Aspergers. I have a Bachelor's degree in Physics and a job that, for the most part, I enjoy. I'm a massive nerd with hobbies that include machining, robotics, D&amp;D, MtG, and all things Star Trek (TNG is my favorite). I have a 17 year history of self-harm (cutting) and a 20+ year history of binge eating. As of this moment, I live with my girlfriend and the absolute love of my life, LF. I truly and unconditionally love her. LF will be moving out soon and into her own place, though we will not be breaking up. I currently see a therapist (DD) once per week and a psychiatrist (PG) once per month. For the last 20 years I have routinely seen a therapist and several psychiatrists as well as the occasional neurologist.

&amp;#x200B;

When I finish this I will take my own life. I will hike deep into the woods where I grew up, where I am at peace, where I will not be found, and I will either consume an LD50 dose of Alprazolam with a bottle of Hibiki, or I will shoot myself in heart with a sawed-off 12ga shotgun, or I will consume 500mg of Potassium Cyanide. I have already written my letter to LF and I have put all my affairs in order. 

&amp;#x200B;

My goal in writing this is \*\*not\*\* to elicit pity, to have people try to talk me out of it, to play ""the victim"", or to blame anyone other than myself. My goal is very simple: I hope that others who read this will learn from my experiences and mistakes. I hope that others who read this will find a way to keep going and get better should they find themselves where I am now. I hope that others who read this will find their passions and joys and pursue them. I also hope that, in some way, this will lessen my absence or at least help people understand how and why everything has lead to this choice. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will try to make what I write make sense, though the Schizoaffective Disorder may cause things to come across as fragmented. I will be receptive to limited numbers of questions solely for the purpose of understanding things I have written or to help those going through similar experiences. I do \*\*not\*\* condone suicide and I find it to be cowardly and dishonorable. Yet for me it is the only choice I have left, and it is a choice I am deeply ashamed of. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will try to post a new section of this with a frequency of at least once per week.",26Feb2020,1
