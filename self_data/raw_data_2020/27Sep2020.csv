People were really enjoying my polls, and interacting a ton, getting into great conversations. I was just looking at some other people‚Äôs stories, and I noticed one girl posted polls right after I did WITH THE EXACT SAME QUESTIONS AS ME! It‚Äôs fine to take my idea, sure, polls aren‚Äôt patented and mine. But to take the exact same questions?

My boyfriend and I argue far more than we used to and he gets under my skin. I feel like he‚Äôs putting down on me a lot of the time and frankly we don‚Äôt get along at a core level. I enjoy taking time to sit and self reflect and try to work on changing myself to how I want to be, he has told me he will not self reflect.

17,"Past 5 years, I was in a dark place in life. I had depression, anxiety and I was numb the last 1 year. After college ended, moved in with my family who were very toxic. I was already depressed and going to a toxic place just made things worse. Was too broke to move out and didnt have a job (international student).

8 months ago, i moved in with my friends who knew about my situation and wanted to help me out. I went to therapy session and now I can finally relax and breathe. I no longer feel suffocated. The roommates are the only one I talk to since quarantine started and I have no other friends.

After November/December- my roommates are moving out. Their work permit is ending and they are moving to another country. 

I am very scared and nervous about being alone and how I am gonna handle things once they leave. I also probably need to move to a new place once they leave coz they were renting the apt to me (in a lower price).

I am studying right now in hopes of getting a job from Jan since I had a long gap in resume after graduation. I feel like I have bad anxiety about how things will be after December. Also have super low self confidence. Just scared to face the world. I wish I was confident and wish I believed in myself. Not sure how to handle things and get myself back together.",27Sep2020,1
19,Years ago I was friends with an Italian guy who used to brag about his dad being in the Cicero Chicago mob. I was working part time in the Army Reserve. His dad asked him to get some friends to change a carpet.  So he told me I‚Äôd get $300 just to help lay down carpet. I did it. There were a bunch of guys standing around. After that I got into a van with one of the workers. He had a six pack of miller lite. We drove to a bar in some suburb of Chicago. I think Schaumburg. He came on to me. He wanted me to suck his dick. I didn‚Äôt. We went into the bar. And that bar was super sketch. It was 100%  a mob bar.,27Sep2020,1

23,I hate how healthy options are way more expensive. Doctors apon doctors always tell you to eat healthier. When you have a family of 5 its ridiculous on what you can afford. Where i live they raised the grocery prices but kept the wages of earnings the same. This has been for a couple of years now. So when you work full time and pay bills almost all the rest goes for groceries. There are no options here in a town of 250 and 40 miles from the walmart which is the only grocery store within a 2 hour drive. Sadly. Its not an option to move. Who has the money to move anyways?

28,"I don‚Äôt know where to start. For years I tried to be the ‚Äúman‚Äù and ignore everything that bothers me. Just push it down and leave it there. Today I went overboard.

I am 16. And since I‚Äôve been 10 I went through a lot, mentally. My dad almost disowning me, my parents calling be disabled fat pig, suicide attempt, getting heartbroken, losing all of my friends, almost failing school, and lastly this fucking isolation. I ignored all of that. Yes, it bothered me, but I was trying to be as much of a man as I can and push it down. Until today. 

I‚Äôve met a girl recently, she‚Äôs the best person ever. We started dating and I just couldn‚Äôt get enough of her. I constantly miss her, and that‚Äôs when my insecurities started to pop up. I just always think that she will leave, cheat or play me. I constantly check her location. Constantly think ‚Äúwhy isn‚Äôt she answering? I saw her online‚Äù ‚Äúwhere is she?‚Äù ‚Äúwho is she talking to?‚Äù just constantly. It all happened before, and I was hoping it went away, but it didn‚Äôt. 

Once I realized that, I burst out and started to cry. Popped like a bubble. 

Just like a bitch. I couldn‚Äôt stop, I realized, I am depressed. I can‚Äôt be happy on my own. I‚Äôm like a cripple, I need someone to help me. And when I don‚Äôt have that someone - I‚Äôm depressed. I realized that I was never happy recently, and pushing all of it down doesn‚Äôt help. Like now she‚Äôs out with friends and I can‚Äôt be just happy for her like a human being, I have to check her location, everything. I‚Äôm so ashamed of myself for crying, for checking her location, for not trusting. I feel so disgusting. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I wish I did. 

I am going to see her tomorrow and I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll look into her eyes. I feel horrible, and miserable.",27Sep2020,1
29,"This is stupid and nothing but maybe you‚Äôll get a chuckle.  A few days ago I came across the LinkedIn profile of a woman I ever so briefly was hooking up with almost 20 years ago.  Thinking back I wasn‚Äôt really so interested but I was looking to get laid of course. We met at a singles event and kissed, and went on two dates. On the second date I went up to her apartment and we did everything but. I‚Äôll spare the details (unless anyone is interested) but it didn‚Äôt go so great at the end.  She invited me to stay but I could tell she really wanted me to leave so I did.  I called her a few more times the following week and she blew me off, and that was that.  No big. 

So back to the story, I‚Äôm on LinkedIn and while you are on the site sometimes it shows people you may know.  One of them is her. So sure I am curious I click on her profile and she‚Äôs done pretty well for herself.  I know that (depending on your setting) when you view someone‚Äôs profile they can see it, but I didn‚Äôt care. Nothing bad had actually happened between us or anything. So I thought nothing of it. To my surprise today she sent me a connection invitation request. No personalized message or anything just the standard.  I‚Äôm not going to accept it.  I don‚Äôt know her and we are not associated at all professionally - I have no idea why LinkedIn showed me her profile.  At the same time, as absolutely ridiculous as this sounds, this is a tiny bit of a self-esteem boost.  In my warped mind, she is thinking back on that night 20 years ago and saying ‚Äúgee that guy was not so bad.  Maybe I‚Äôd fuck him now.‚Äù  I‚Äôm married so that‚Äôs out of the question. But I am still amused by this.",27Sep2020,1
30,"It‚Äôs simply because finding music I haven‚Äôt ever listened to, which is decades decades too late, is so much more exciting than listening to new music that is emerging. And that‚Äôs not to say I hate new music at all.

It makes me feel nostalgic for a time I wasn‚Äôt even part of and makes me feel so so happy when I find treasure from years ago. 

I‚Äôve decided to choose an album for a couple of days/ a week and get to know it like I would have if I lived in that time. We‚Äôre in a crippling and horrible lockdown in my city and I feel this is going to help my mental health so much.",27Sep2020,1
31,"How do I free myself of this self destructive mindset? 

You‚Äôd think I hate myself by the way I treat myself, and maybe I do to some extent. It‚Äôs subconscious, so it‚Äôs difficult to stop. 

Yes, I‚Äôve been trying to find a therapist. One that is the right fit. It‚Äôs difficult to find a male therapist who isn‚Äôt either a substance abuse counselor or a psychiatrist. I don‚Äôt do well with female therapists though.

I‚Äôve tried meditation but it‚Äôs so hard to be with myself. It feels unbearable to be with my own mind.

What are some other coping skills some of you (you who have gone through something similar) have utilized?

I will find a therapist and I‚Äôll speak to my therapist about changing meds during our next appointment, but in the short term I need some positive coping skills.

32,I haven't really seen people in so long and I am pissed off with my friends. I am tired of always being the one who calls or texts first. They never check on me and I don't feel like putting in the effort anymore. Most of them don't even know that my aunt died this summer. I haven't seen my boyfriend in a few months and I just feel a bit disconnected from him and sometimes (and I know he doesn't mean too) I feel a little forgotten.

I almost feel guilty for having fun in the first place. 

What really brings me down is my lack of success with women. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm a completely ugly dude as I have attracted girls when going out to clubs in the past. But these good times only happened because of the confidence alcohol gave me. I‚Äôve never even had a relationship. Now I‚Äôm in my early 20s and feel like I‚Äôve already missed out on having young love. I am talking to a girl now but I know she isn‚Äôt nearly as excited to see me as I am to see her.  

Seeing young, attractive people makes me want to disappear. I look in the mirror and hate myself. Recently I got my FSC card but I‚Äôm not fully decided if I will act on that.

34,"just a heads up for sensitive men, ladies issues are vaguely discussed in this post. 

this happened about a year ago, i went to urgent care for something related to vaginal issues. a doctor asked me if i was sexually active, at the time i was 16. i said i was, he went on a small rant about how its not the best idea to be doing that at my age, how i need to wait until i truly love someone  then he says to me, ‚Äúhave you ever heard of reclaimed virginity?‚Äù i said no and he says ‚Äúwell you know you can always take that back whenever you want right?‚Äù 

first of all, i never asked for your advice, second of all, i dont want my virginity back. ive been with the same guy since my freshman year and im now a senior. even if i wish i had never met my boyfriend i still wouldnt regret all the memories and experiences i had with him. life is full of experiences, good and bad. 

anyway, this just came into my brain again for some reason and now thinking back it seems pretty damn unethical? like now i dont really ever want a male doctor, especially for issues down there. i honestly get why some women are so against having male gynaecologists. i really dont blame them.",27Sep2020,2

37,"I honestly can not do anything right. The first layer is me fighting for child support against my abusive ex who wants nothing to do with my three babies and claims no responsibility. It‚Äôs heart wrenching because my girls are absolutely everything to me and deserve the world or at least deserve to have their needs met.

The second layer is my pedo landlord who installed hidden cameras in the home I was renting and distributed lewd pictures to god only knows how many people. He is contesting the charges and claiming we were in a relationship. I had to identify over 150 hidden camera pictures which was easily the worst thing I have ever done. Court for that will be coming up and I don‚Äôt know if I have it in me to fight anymore and be strong. This man has completely ruined my life and we were homeless for months because I wasn't willing to risk my girls safety.

That brings me to my third layer, my storage unit.

Except my unit got flooded and I wasn‚Äôt notified so everything I owned sat wet inside my unit. Ruining furniture, mattresses, clothing, everything in soggy boxes.

39,"I‚Äôm a senior at university. We met while I was in secondary school (I think it‚Äôs called high school in the US?) because we‚Äôre from the same town. Honestly it was a great relationship, because we really got each other and both found each other hot.

The problem? I always knew it would eventually have to come to an end. See, my country is very, very class based, among many other issues, and she and I come from very different classes‚Äî she‚Äôs on the lower end, I‚Äôm on the upper. I myself couldn‚Äôt care at all about it. But I‚Äôm planning a career in business and politics‚Äî I want to improve my country‚Äî and me being with a girl of a different class would hinder me. It‚Äôs terrible but it‚Äôs how it works. It isn‚Äôt about me really‚Äî personally I would be fine living in a cave (as in living in squalor) as long as it‚Äôs with her, but I need to look beyond myself‚Äî I have ideas for this country, and the means‚Äî I‚Äôm rich, connected, can speak well, and understand how people work‚Äî so I need to sacrifice my own needs for those of the people. 

I never expected for our relationship to last this long, I never expected her and I to actually *click* so much when I saw her on the street and thought she was hot. I didn‚Äôt know she had previous bad experiences with guys using her and leaving her.

After I realized that, I knew I couldn‚Äôt be the one to break up with her. I care for her, I don‚Äôt want to see her getting hurt. If I broke up with her, she‚Äôd feel terrible, and the whole thing would reinforce the ideas *guys* left her and she was worthless. I don‚Äôt want that for her, so I figured out she has to break up with me. She has to think I‚Äôm not good enough for her and break things off. That way it doesn‚Äôt hurt her, and I also now am clear to begin my career. This way it‚Äôs framed in her mind as ‚ÄòDamn guess my boyfriend changed so I broke it off‚Äô instead of ‚Äòyet another guy abandons me‚Äô.

So I did. I slowly pulled her strings to make her annoyed by me, did things that she didn‚Äôt like, etc, and slowly increased those actions until she finally broke up with me.

Do I feel regret? Yes, absolutely. But it has to be done. I already have a job offer to be on a senior MP‚Äôs staff, and more will probably come. This was inevitable, and I did it in the least damaging way.",27Sep2020,1

My problem is that every time I have some downtime, my thoughts go sex or relationships. Some days I rub one out fast three to four times to get rid of the thoughts and focus on something else, but it always comes back. When I'm not horny, I'm fantazising about what it is to be with someone. 

During the day I have ways to get my attention on other things, writing, working out, cooking pastry or whatever. The worst is in the veening, when I start to get tired and just want to rest, that's when it comes back strong.

COVID-19 has taken my life to a very dark place.
I made a post a little while ago because I was in a bad place, and I was worried my father in law had COVID-19.

Well it‚Äôs official. My father in law has COVID-19. His condition has gotten progressively worse over the past couple of days. 

He was doing ok at home beforehand, but now he‚Äôs been moved to the hospital. I don‚Äôt get to see him because of the restrictions around hospitals due to the virus, so I can‚Äôt even talk to him. My girlfriend has seen him, and she says he looks really sick, but is keeping a smile on his face the whole time. 

Has anyone else here had any older/weaker relatives get Covid? Are there any success stories of them recovering?

I‚Äôm at home now, and I‚Äôve been so upset all day, I‚Äôm just terrified we are going to lose him. Continuing to try and find a job has been keeping my mind off it during the day, but at night I just get lost in a pit of bad thoughts. I‚Äôm hungry, and worried, and broke, and scared. This has been one of my toughest covid months yet. 

I‚Äôve been jobless for a while now, since we went into lockdown, and my savings are gone, but being broke and hungry is the least of my worries now. I just hope I can get a job soon so I can help my girlfriends family out, because right now I can‚Äôt even support myself. I feel like I‚Äôm drowning in debt and worries.

In high school all I cared about was football, and messed around in class. Acted like a dumbass all the time. During quarantine I had the opportunity to think back on it, and cringe at all the stupid things I used to say and do. I have always been a good person, but looking back it is clear to me that I portrayed myself as a dumb jock, when in reality I know for a damn fact I‚Äôve always been intelligent. 

I apologize if this post is just me rambling about nonsense, but I thought I‚Äôd say it. Be yourself, don‚Äôt act like a fool. Be confident in your abilities and know that you are intelligent. Anything is possible when you put your mind to it.

67,"I am a med student this year and I have been thinking of giving up and stopping already because of a lot of reasons. I‚Äôve also been crying and having tons of breakdowns this month.

Just awhile ago, I went out to pick up a book from a classmate. While I was walking back home, I was teary and I wanted to cry again and just give everything up. I walked slowly and looked up at the sky and asked if I am in the correct path and if I am doing it right. At the lobby, I pressed the elevator button and a man who was carrying two big bags went with me inside. He asked me to press his floor number and I did, he then saw the thick book I was holding and asked me if I was a law student and I said no, I was a med student. He smiled and told me his child was a law student and was also reading tons of thick books. I smiled at him and agreed. When he reached his floor, he asked me what year I was and I said I‚Äôm just a first year and he told me that time flies fast and it‚Äôll all be over real quick. Before the door closed, he left and said, ‚ÄúThank you, doctor‚Äù which touched my heart and made me cry so hard.

Hearing it from someone you don‚Äôt know and just when you asked the world a few mins ago if you were in the right path was all so coincidental that I broke down again.

68,"I found out the news of my older brother's overdose death two days after it happened, on the day my family was putting down our 14 year old boston terrier no less. That was three months ago now, and I've slowly learned to navigate this new and unfamiliar world after the worst day of my life. 

It happened two weeks after I became the first in the family to graduate college. My brother wrote on a graduation card about how I was his role model, and that card happens to be one of the things keeping me going. It's like I feel some innate desire to keep learning and getting better in his honor; to live my life for two, in a sense. 

The pandemic obviously has made the grieving process weirder, but having a good support system helped immensely, whether virtually or not. However, now that I've moved back home after being at school for 5 years (just moved in first of September), it feels strange to be back in a space without them in it. I've found that easing back into it has helped (taking trips, staying busy, etc.), as I'm learning to be grateful for this precious time with my family at home (was a toxic environment in the past before college but now is better so I'm actually very happy to be here). 

I'm not sure why I felt inspired to write about this, but I know that it helps to share.

This is an anon account because I‚Äôm frankly scared to put this much out there for people who know me. I am a mid-30‚Äôs female and I was recently diagnosed with hemiplegic migraines. In short, my migraines create symptoms that mimic a stroke. My left side is at 60-80% mobility and manageable pain on good days. At the worst of it I‚Äôve forgotten my own name and how to write, and lost muscle control on one side. Light is my biggest trigger - computers make me feel like I‚Äôm going to have seizures unless the background is black. Fluorescent lighting is the same. I‚Äôve had to leave my university program and my job. Medicines exist to address the pain, but not my vision issues. 

So, people of reddit. I need some kind of idea, any kind of idea, really, about starting a new career. Given the modern world, the idea of finding a job absent of computers is daunting. The fact that I am a single parent means that it would have to be a fairly lucrative job. I‚Äôm willing to get new certifications. I‚Äôm teachable. I‚Äôm at a loss...

These past days I‚Äôve experienced so much emotional discomfort. It‚Äôs only lately as well that I‚Äôve learned about mindfulness but as I tried incorporating it in my life, I realize in the process I have been numbing myself as well.

I‚Äôve known about vulnerability like four years ago and read so much about it but it comes as a surprise to me now that I wasn‚Äôt actually being vulnerable in any way.

I thought I learned to love myself over the past six years of soul-searching. I thought I got vulnerability figured out. I thought I was nailing this mindfulness tool but with how I‚Äôve been feeling lately, it just shows the exact opposite.

I feel like I‚Äôve been cheating on how I really feel. I think that I accept my emotions, my negative thoughts, but it doesn‚Äôt really feel like that.

89,"It's been one week since it happened

I couldnt bring myself to speak at his funeral. We had broken up a few weeks before this happened. Turned out he was driving drunk,  and too fast, and lost control. He died at the scene, no helmet on. 


He was.... my everything, for so long. We were high school sweethearts, fuck it we were even middle school sweethearts. He was my first kiss, my first boyfriend. I gave my whole life to him, I sacrificed so much just for him.


We got an abortion in March, leading to us falling apart and the breakup. It just took my blinders off to how honestly emotionally abusive and manipulative he was. Constantly snapping at me, making me feel bad for things that weren't my fault, and then acting like it's no big deal when I try to stand up for myself. Or would act like I'm crazy for defending myself. I'd take care of his every need, laundry, food, sometimes even pay his phone bill, and he'd find some way to complain about all of it. Didnt do his laundry right, needed food when he got home from work even though i was working too, complained that I only paid his phone bill so I could talk to him (????? Yeah??). Hated all my friends, talked shit about them to the point where I felt like I couldnt be friends with them anymore. During quarantine he acted like I was a deadbeat cause he was an essential worker and I wasnt. Called me an alcoholic after I turned 21, which he knew was a big fear and insecurity of mine, then proceeded to drink 6 beers in front of me the same night. Lived in my dad's house the past two years, treated my room like it was his only. Would invite people over while i was still in bed, and wouldn't tell me, so I'd still be in my pajamas or even half naked when people would come over to hang out. He'd bully me in front of ""our"" friends to the point where they thought it was normal and they'd even laugh about it. Would say things like he had something sweet planned to get my hopes up,  and then rarely ever followed through. When I got pregnant he made my feelings insignificant by saying they were just ""hormones"" and I didnt actually feel that way. After the abortion he gaslight me and told me he actually wanted to keep it, despite the fact he was willing to take me on the fucking motorcycle just to get me there and get it done.


It's just been, SIX YEARS of me trying to act like we were okay, when we weren't. Trying to act like he was good to me when he wasnt. I finally gave up, broke up with him, and was starting to learn my truth about the situation. And then he fucking dies. Everyone is talking about how fucking awesome of a person he was. Granted, he was a awesome friend. But he was terrible to me. And I cant say ANYTHING about it anymore. I cant speak my truth. I cant tell his friends that I'm not crazy and he just made me like that. I just have to suffer, knowing that all these people probably thought I was the bad guy. God, I know he died and of course i feel awful, i was with him for 6 years.

94," The Situation

I'm 31, a computer programmer... own my own home... have a wife and 9 year old daughter. Pretty self sufficient for my own life... but not a ""business man"". I've never transferred a deed, never had anybody close to me die, I've never even seen a ""will"" (though my grandpa is fairly certain he had one).

2 days ago, my dad, 63, passed away from a massive unexpected blood clot / heart attack. His hospital visit lasted about 2 hours, and they called ""code blue"" 3 times. Prior to this, he seemed extremely healthy, and was one of the most active people i knew. He had some form of ""obama care"" as he called it.

He's been divorced for 26 years, and I was an only child. His assents include:

1. His home (his home, where i grew up) . . .
2. A ""shop"" which consisted of  

   1. 2 small apartment that he rented out
   2. 20 storage units he rented out
   3. About 3,000 sq ft of a mechanic/handy mans dreamland where he ""tinkered around"" with electronics, machinery, motorcycles, wood, etc. Every kind of nut, bolt, screwdriver, wrench, car part, electronic equipment that you could think of.
3. A small three bedroom home he rented out
4. About 20 different stocks, probably in the vicinity of $700,000
5. An old muscle car, a newer muscle car, and a brand new Jeep.

I needed to take a couple days to grieve, and couldn't bare the thought of going to his home or shop... too many memories. His entire world revolved around my daughter, and they spent 2-3 days together every week just hanging out.

Tomorrow, one of his life-long friends is meeting me at his home... to help me figure things out. Though my dad was fairly secretive, so I don't know how much he will be able to help. I know he has 2 safes with ""important"" documents in them, and I know the combination to one of those safes.

So, finally... to my question

How do I proceed? Which things are most important, and what can wait months to be addressed?

I've contacted his good friend and decades-long tax accountant, and she has offered to help me ""however she can"". I'm sure she probably knows about his different stocks, and maybe can give good advice on how to transfer them???

I've contacted his lifelong friend from college, who knows a lot about cars and mechanics.. who offered to help me ""however he can"", when going through things at ""the shop"".

Should I get an attorney who can help me keep everything organized, and maybe help transferring things to my name?

Should I reach out to all the renters this week, or in a couple weeks, about making the checks to my name instead?

I just need help figuring out what my next steps should be... which things are important and which things can wait... and how to go about acting on them. I feel so lost and alone, even though so many people have offered ""help"".

I felt the entire conversation I had with him over two sessions didn't really help much and it was more like just rambling to a person and I was't comfortable with the idea that I had to pay $200 for it.  


I oscillate between 'I can get stuff done and be productive' to 'I don't want to eat anything and just stay in bed' every few weeks. I feel I can beat depression with a good routine and that depression is a state where my mind is telling me it's unhappy about something and working hard towards a goal I set will help. It does to a certain extent where I feel really good when I am being productive, but if something goes wrong in my plan, I just spiral down for a while and then the small loop continues.  


Working out makes me feel good but once a while, even that spirals down and it sort of makes things worse. How do I be consistent with something ? I feel like I have hit a barrier and I have been unable to get past it for quite  a while.

I don't know what to do right now because clearly I keep failing at the self-help part and I hate being mediocre. I don't want to take meds either because I feel it would just give side-effects and it doesn't really help.

I have only told two people about this, my friend/ex bf (it‚Äôs complicated) and my therapist.

I was 16 and in high school, he was a 50 something year old teacher. I was shy and had anxiety and struggled every day. I was vulnerable and when he spoke to me in his office a few times I thought he was just trying to help. Apparently the more time I spent around him, the more he became attracted to me. I was naive and didn‚Äôt know what any of it meant, and I live with the guilt and blame myself every damn day because of it. He said he would talk more about his personal life when I turned 18, and I believed him, and every day I regret letting it get to that point and not realizing what was wrong. He got mad at me for getting into a relationship at 17, how did I not see the red flags? He told me he was attracted to me after I started university at 18, I rejected him and yet I kept him around. 

I finally went no contact after I met my friend/ex at 20. I felt like I was free. One day I had a breakdown and told my ex everything that happened. He cried with me and said that it wasn‚Äôt my fault because my brain was still developing. 

I‚Äôm going to therapy to deal with many things, but a huge part of it is my guilt over what happened. I‚Äôm slowly coming to terms with everything that happened but it‚Äôs going to take a while for me to stop blaming myself and start living for the future instead of staying in the past.

129,"So, should probably explain a bit. I am disabled, kind of, maybe? I have been ill for 5 long years, nearly 6, but who's counting.. it took them 3 of those years to not look at my ovaries and lady bits. They kept finding things wrong, but non of them were what was causing my worsening pain. After 4 years, I went to the doctor with a suggestion, maybe it was fibromyalgia, he asked me a series of short questions and I had a diagnosis. Brilliant! We can manage this, nope. The long I thought about it, the less it made sense, I dont have major pain in my joints, it doesn't change with my mood, I don't go stiff and nothing but movement triggers the worsened pain etc. 

The pain has been progressively getting worse, I now cant bathe myself, dress myself, cook for myself, brush my hair and many more, all at the grand age of 26. So I ended up back at the out of hours doctors again so I can have 5mg of morphine and was told to go to the doctors the next day, he also mentioned that there was no chance I had fibro (spoiler - neither did the next doctor, or the next...). So I made an appointment and at said appointment I mentioned about how I sit with my legs crossed because it helps with the pain a little. A few weeks later I'm laid on an x-ray table having an x-ray on my hip. 

Turns out, that not only have I been told I'm wrong for saying I have pain on my groin/hip that I can litually pin point for these dense mother fuckers, but that I have a deformed top of my femur, but this stupid shit has caused cysts on my femur.

Cysts. On. My. Fucking. Femur. 

WHAT.

5 years, and never once did they look WHERE THE PAIN WAS. No, no. Had to be my lady parts because I must be hysterical, something that had been said to me. So, their solution you ask? Loose weight (even though I am at a good weight for my height, and when I was at a lower weight my pain was bad? Ok) and EXERCISE. ok, cool, but yano that thing where I was around a tesco express and it makes me bed bound for days? Yeah, I'll exercise. With the food side of things, god knows what that is doing, considering I am eating as the damn weight person is telling me and I'm still gaining. WHAT DO THEY WANT FROM ME? 

So, for the past 3 days I have been at home sitting, crocheting. I get up and walk the hall and go to the loo every hour and stretch multiple times a day, but other than that I have done nothing, zilch, nada. But guess who came out to play last night while I was just sitting. PAIN. I didnt do anything. Was just sat, but then I suppose how dare I for considering to exist?! I have now been in quite bad pain for over 24hours, so I now have to go and see the doctors again tomorrow, the same ones who told me I was too young to be in pain, that's it's in my head or that it was my mental health. I have to go and beg for help, for some understanding.

I'm 26, my partner knew me for 6 months before I became ill, he never knew me fully as the healthy and happy.person I was. I haven't been able to go and learn, get a career, explore the world or start a family like we do desperately want. Honestly, the way I am, we couldn't cope with a baby, and I dont know how long this is going to take to fix, if they can fix me. If they cant, my life was ripped away at 21, to where my life revolves around pain, medication, tv shows, bed and sobbing. 

I am so tired of this, I am tired of not being able to sleep because of the pain, the nausea because of the pain, just the damn pain I get no respite from. I just want to live this life, this one chance I have to live. I am missing my LIFE. I am so so tired.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, I made a reddit account just to share this theory, although I have been on reddit for a while just observing. The other science subreddits did not seem like the appropriate place to share this, so I'm coming here as it seems like a more accepting place for the kind of scientific discord that I am looking for (more dialogue, and less general condescension).

&amp;#x200B;

I have been working on my Theory for some time now, it's name, as you can see in the title, is ""Populationally Influenced Stochastic Solipsism,"" but don't let the title scare you, I find long names humorous, and so I will just be referring to it as ""The Theory"" or ""Theory"" for short (although the full name is actually ""Populationally Influenced Stochastic Solipsism \*as Generated by Initial Solipsistic Creator\*"" that isn't actually important right now).

&amp;#x200B;

If you have already broken down the title on your own, you may have an idea of where this is going (although the end result may still surprise you). In simplest terms, The Theory says that if you believe something to be true, then it is true. BUT you have to be the first person in your population to believe it, AND you have to believe if whole heartedly. Now, I recognize that this might sound like gibberish at first, and many people get overwhelmed just hearing that, but I can prove how this is true (just keep reading!).

&amp;#x200B;

To make this simpler, I will use an analogy: language. All language is created ultimately by whichever population that created it. That is to say, language is (obviously) not a universal thing, and each nation/ population created their own language in a somewhat arbitrary manner. The reasons that English speakers say ""Window"" is because a long time ago, somebody decided that ""Window"" was what that clear piece of glass was called, and then everybody else followed them.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, language is not knowledge, and the evolution of language is not the same as the evolution of knowledge, but they are similar enough to create an understandable bridge between the two.

&amp;#x200B;

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

NOW ON TO THE PROOF. BECAUSE THIS IS A TESTABLE THEORY

&amp;#x200B;

Taking from the window analogy, if I believe something to be a fact, that nobody else has considered and truly believe it to be true (those are the two axioms needed to make this work: 1 Nobody else has considered it. 2. You must wholeheartedly believe your claim to be true), then that means that I can create statements of 'knowledge' out of pure spontaneity.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I will now create a random mathematical equation, which I will then (TRULY) believe to be true. And it is my belief that (as long as nobody else has considered this mathematical equation before) that it will then BECOME true. Of course, it is always possible that somebody else has considered this equation prior, so this may not work, but I will try to create something random enough that other people have probably not thought of it. (Here goes!)

&amp;#x200B;

Take ANY prime number greater than 4, and subtract 1. Then divide that number by two. We will call this number X.  Add all the numbers up to and including X (1+2+3+4... all the way to X). The sum of all of these numbers will be divisible by 3.

&amp;#x200B;

This\^ statement is made up of five random (stochastically) generated mathematical operations (which I highly doubt anybody has ever seriously considered in that order): we have a prime number greater than 4, subtraction by one, division by two, iterative addition, and then division by three. (Technically being a prime number greater than 4 isn't an operation, but the point stands, that I basically just said ""okay 1,2,3,4,"" picked a few operations and stuck the numbers inside (To be frank I started with 4 in the beginning, trying to be random about it and then said ""wait, it doesn't matter"" and just stuck the next three in the equation in the order that they appeared LOL).

&amp;#x200B;

I will now TRULY believe this statement to be true (this part is hard and is not always doable quickly because you have to believe it 'to your soul,' but I will try it once just to prove this point)...

&amp;#x200B;

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so now I TRULY believe that that MATHEMATICAL statement is true, and therefor, it WILL be. This is the biggest difference between my Theory and other ""crackpot new age science"" theories. Mine is TESTABLE (although I'm not going to test my above statement because I already believe it to be true, testing it would be a waste of energy in an obvious situation (plus, even if I did test it on my own, skeptics would say I had some sort of confirmation bias going on when I proved it to be true.)

&amp;#x200B;

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

Now the biggest ramification of this theory revolves around the question of ""what happens if two people believe contradictory thoughts at the same time and in the same populace?"" And here's where we get to the Property of Non-Mutual Exclusivity. Something that can be true and false at the same time. These statements of knowledge that are birthed into existence simultaneously exist as a free flowing entity that exists or doesn't exist somewhat at random. I believe this is what happened with the Coronavirus in the United States. Some people believed it to exist while others did not, which is why many people are unaffected in highly infected areas, and other people have gotten seriously sick from it in otherwise clean areas.

&amp;#x200B;

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

So what do you guys think? I certainly believe it to be true, and I have offered my proof, which I believe should be enough to at least get some people to waver in their beliefs (or do I believe more than just that?).

Science (or perhaps it is better in this instance to say ""the pursuit of knowledge"") is always best when shared with others.",27Sep2020,1

139,"I don‚Äôt want any of this to sound like I‚Äôm playing the victim but here lately I‚Äôve been feeling like a humongous failure in my relatively short time that I‚Äôve been alive.

I went to college right out of high school with big aspirations of being a high school choir director, as music has always been my biggest passion. Upon arriving at college in 2015 I was met with the most toxic and unsafe college experience ever. Constant drinking, partying, and absolutely never being a responsible human.

After my first semester I lost my scholarships that were helping me pay for college so now I am in heaps of debt from student loans. After the second semester and about 4000 dollars in student loan debt I moved back in with my parents only for a short time before moving to live with a friend from high school away from my hometown. 

Living away from my hometown in a completely new state was a great experience for me. I joined a band and got to see a lot of the country that I would have never gotten to see without that opportunity. I was job hopping while living in that other state, which proved to be a dumb idea.

Anyways, I left that place because I had acquired a girlfriend back in my home state. The girlfriend thing didn‚Äôt work out, and I am now living with my family in my hometown. 

Things could be worse, but right now I‚Äôm helping my uncle run his lawn care business and that‚Äôs strictly it. My life is devoted to work and I‚Äôm surprised I‚Äôve even been able to find the time to write this.

I want to go back to college and I was going to be going for my mechanics license this semester, but my parents talked me out of it until I became more financially stable. I know their suggestion was made with the best intentions, but I feel like I‚Äôve already wasted so much time and I want to get college done and start living comfortably.

TLDR: I just feel like I‚Äôve wasted too much time and I‚Äôm stuck in a rut. I‚Äôm only 24 but I feel stuck where I‚Äôm at and don‚Äôt see chances to move forward.",27Sep2020,1

being poor, when mind is sore, being poor sucks, and it‚Äôs a chore 

I don‚Äôt like it, I abhor it 

I don‚Äôt like it, because it‚Äôs shit

people can be‚Ä¶assholes‚Ä¶

Some people act like, assholes 

And some people are pricks, and manners some just lack those

And I don‚Äôt eat no cows milk, cause I don‚Äôt need that lactose 

And I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs tasty, but I think that‚Äô that‚Äôs gross 

Just like you don‚Äôt need a spider, so you can have it‚Äôs silk 

shitty situation 

And in my frustration 

sleeping in a car sucks‚Ä¶for a million reasons 

there‚Äôs a million reasons, that I could use a million bucks 

This stress and anxiety is a pain 

And it really sucks 

And this stress and anxiety is a  drain

situation, it is lame 

Feels like I‚Äôve tried to play but, never did I win the game

It‚Äôs a joke, I‚Äôm still broke

But I don‚Äôt drink and, I don‚Äôt smoke
