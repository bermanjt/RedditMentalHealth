Social¬†Quantitative easing.


Environmental¬†Quantitative easing.


All financial trading is done in its own currency with variable exchange rates for buying into and selling back between the trading currency and national currencies at rates set by the UN.¬† This variable rate is¬† adjusted to protect economies from excessive peaks and troughs created by market volatility.


If companies do well then dividends are paid to shareholders.¬† If a company performs poorly then shareholders are liable for shortfalls in wages and pensions for that company.


All workers in a company are in the same pension scheme - not separate schemes for directors and workers.


100% global tax on all military weapons sales (even if the weapons are made by the country buying them) paid to the UN and used soley to fund education, healthcare and social care in¬†the poorest countries in the world at the time.¬†


Please feel free to add you (serious) suggestions to this list.¬†


Finance is something we made up.¬†


Let that sink in for a moment. We made it up. If we ceased to exist tomorrow then finance would no longer exist, but if we woke up tomorrow and finance no longer existed, we would still exist, and we would continue to exist. 


If it doesn't work for all of us¬†then it's time to reimagine the thing we made up to make it work for all of us. This equilibrium of finance will NOT happen until we do this.¬†We will continue to suffer it until we do this and once we do this, finance will cease to be the problem we have let it become.

5,"i'm not sure which is harder, breaking into IT or getting a better job in IT.

I'm in the data field (~3 years). My resume is definitely getting noticed and have been getting some steady interviews since February even in this job market. 
That's definitely the optimistic part.

But these tech interviews are really stressing me out. I feel a little out of depth and sometimes REALLY out of depth. It's just really rough; presentations, coding assignments, multiple rounds of interviews, panels of people, tech questions...i'm definitely out of gas.

Emotional stress is through the roof. 

3 years ago, i had ZERO IT, went to 50+ interviews in span of about 10 months until i landed in my current role. It was just as brutal and just as intense as now.

Just need to vent!",09Jul2020,1
6,"By 'brains' I mean their RNA, enzymes and shit, just hear those satisfying 'pop' sounds as their enveloped membrane bursts open like a water balloon full of goo. And possibly high pitched squealing sounds of fear as the viruses try to slowly roll around like Zorb Balls to pathetically escape my wrath.

While they are rolling around like idiots, I'd like to imagine they left out a pungent odor, alike to that of a mixture of sweat, unwashed crotch, old fish, and swamp ass. I immediately Febreeze the room.

I'd first rip their stupid little red dicks (Spike glycoproteins) off, one by one, after getting them to come close to me by showing the bastards a pair of inflatable lungs. I'd like to imagine the viruses whimpering and shuddering every time I pluck one off. Then when there's none left and the stupid virus is crying in pain and fear, I'd get a hammer and smash that fucker's head in.

By the time I'm finished, the room would be saturated with a colorless, slimy goo and ripped off virus dicks that I would then place in a bowl filled with water, boil that shit in a microwave so their dicks have melted, then pour it down the drain.",09Jul2020,1
7,"She admitted to not vaccinating me for certain things already, but did not tell me which

When all my friends where getting the tetanus vaccination I was the only one not, when asking her why, she said there can be a lot of health defects and explained how other ‚Äúherbal remedies‚Äù could assist in making me better instead of preventing it with a vaccination. 

She also alluded to the reason for me having eczema was because of a vaccination which I am not sure is even possible.   

I guess my question is, should I seek out getting those vaccinations on my own? Any advice would be greatly appreciated

10,"My grandmother (62) and cousin (25) were both diagnosed with cancer today. It didn't quite hit me till a couple hours ago and now I'm having a hard time keeping myself togethwr. 

I was already starting to struggle a bit more than usual with my depression, now two of the people I love dearly are sick. All I can see in my mind is them gone. My eyes burn.

I was never quite an affectionate person, so of course now, of all times, is the time I need a hug. I know it's the responsible thing to do, and it's what I'm going to do, but I still hate the fact that I have to social distance. The only thing in the world I want right now is a hug. Besides my family to be healthy of course, but I can't change that.

On top of that, my only friend is moving 400 miles away in three weeks. She's the only person I feel I can be myself around. She's moving to go to college, so I'm happy *for*  her, but... I'm not happy overall. If that makes sense. I don't mean to whine or sound entitled to her presence, I know she's her own person and I refuse to even let myself show her that I'm upset about her moving.

I don't know what I'm expecting to get out of this. Maybe it's just that I want to get it off my chest.",09Jul2020,1
12,"I had depression at a somewhat young age, but I didn't think of it as that. I had convinced myself that the way I was feeling and the thoughts I would have were normal and that everyone dealt with this. It wasn't until I was in high school and my boyfriend(now husband) told me that this wasn't normal. Fast forward to now and I am feeling much better. We have been together for 6 years and we have our 1 month old little girl. However, I do worry that my depression will surprise me with a visit. I'm not constantly thinking about this, but it is a genuine concern of mine. Those that have struggled with depression, do you share this concerns as well? How do you deal with it? Or am I overthinking it?",09Jul2020,1

I'm home now and eating my spaghetti then I got a notification from Reddit saying that it's my cake day! I haven't had a great day like this for months!

18,"This line resonates so much today as I had my bath earlier on. Today, I realized how much I took my body for granted. In my entire existence, today is the first day I thanked myself, my body, my arms, my legs and myself. My tears started streaming when I gently brushed my legs thanking it for being amazing and for perfectly functioning and said sorry for not noticing how much they help me get through my days.


I am not my enemy. I grew up hating myself, my body, every inch of me and punishing myself for having every imperfections I see. Today it was different, I thanked every inch of me for perfectly existing and for functioning. _My body is the temple of my soul_. My tummy is not my enemy no matter how bloated I get; my legs are not my enemy no matter how gigantic they are; my arms help me reach out to everything no matter how manly looking they are. My body is my ally, every part of me function for me and help me get through the daily adversities. My body does not deserved the inner shame and insecurities I have throughout my life.

19,As of today I lost weight and am at a ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù weight for my height which is considered short for a male but for a year I was never happy with the results I still have more to go but this week I finally accepted the way my body and that was that it‚Äôs wider than normal because of my hips and while I feel a bit better I‚Äôm not exactly comfortable with my body.

20,"Well this turned more into a rant than I thought it would've been but whatever.

Since I graduated high school I've been mainly living at my grandparent's house. I really don't like being at my house. I have no privacy because I must *always* keep my bedroom door open (so the AC unit can cool the back half of the house), I'm never allowed to sleep in, and God forbid I take a nap later in the day. However my grandparents don't mind any of this.

However, last September/October I became depressed (not diagnosed but I'd guarantee they'd diagnose me with it if I went to have it checked; I think I might actually be bipolar but that's another thing). Anyways, I decided to go to my house last week to use our pool since the weather was nice, and my mom took that opportunity to force me to get a job.

Normally this wouldn't be an issue for people, but it is for me. She and my stepdad sat down with me and talked about it, and I broke down and finally told her how I was feeling. I said I had very little will to live anymore despite everything she's done for me. I had been feeling somewhat suicidal for a while but this is the first time I'd ever told it to family.

Well, I don't think she took it too seriously. Because of how I feel, I believe it would make working at a job very difficult for me right now. I could probably force myself to perform the expected level of output for someone working whatever job it may be, but that's it. I wouldn't enjoy it at all. She forced me to apply to several places in town and starting last Monday, I was forced to work for her company, which does house construction and restoration.

It's a very physical job as you can probably imagine, and I am definitely not in shape, especially due to being depressed. I just didn't give a shit about my body anymore, really. I'm not fat but slightly overweight. I thought about going to the gym at my university's campus before while I was in school or coming up, but I just don't think I have the willpower to get myself there and actually exercising.

Anyways, last Sunday my mom told me (while I was at my grandparents' house) that if I didn't come home to work for her, she would take everything that I own away and then come up to my grandparents' house to take the stuff I moved up there, too. I am *19* by the way. Everything I have I either got from my mom as a gift, or bought it using money she or my grandparents or other family gifted me. The only thing of mine that's technically hers is my car, since it's legally in her name and she pays insurance.

At this point I don't really think I would care if she took the car away because I never go anywhere, anyways. Everything else, however, I think she has no right to take. She's basically taking my things hostage to get me to do whatever she wants. Usually her target is my computers or game consoles since I use those the most (only my desktop PC is at my house, though). I think she would argue that they're technically hers since they're in her house and was bought with her money, but I disagree. Once you gift someone something you lose all right to it. She always nags me about how all I do is spend my time on my computer. Well you know what? I do that because it helps me cope with my fucking depression, mom. Playing games or watching videos helps me experience joy for once and lets me forget about how I'm feeling.

She told me she would take my things after I had already come out as suicidal to her. And because she didn't take it seriously, that's probably why she said that. Taking away something that helps a suicidal or someone in depression cope is not a smart idea.

I reluctantly said I would come home to work for her, which I have been this week. Today was hell; working in 95 degree heat outside in the sun for 8 hours was a bitch. And tomorrow I have to do it in even hotter weather. This kind of work is not for me, but I have no choice until one of the places I was forced to apply to message me back. And you know what? I doubt any of them will accept me. I have just over a month before I go back to school, and no place is going to hire for such a short period of time. Also, there's the fact that businesses are all messed up due to the coronavirus, and right now of all times she makes me look for work. While I don't think the virus is as bad as people make it out to be (I think it's being exaggerated), I still don't want to increase my chances of getting it.

In any case, I will be so glad when I'm finally totally independent of her. I don't want to interact with her more than I have to already, so I don't think I will really miss her once I'm on my own. I think that maybe she is also a cause of my depressive state, so going on my own might help it a lot. Yet that depression also stands in the way of me becoming independent. I don't know what to do. Like I said I think I'm suicidal, yet I've never planned or attempted. At least as I am right now, I don't want to die, yet anyways. I'm not sure if something is gonna push me to that point. Literally the only reasons I want to keep living is to experience new stuff of things I enjoy, like TV shows, comics, or video games.

Man, I had been thinking of this time coming. I imagined it would be a little further down the road. I would be finishing college and having to start a career (or any job really), yet with how I feel it would cause a significant hurdle that would be extremely difficult for me to overcome. I wouldn't be able to will myself to work and until that point I was just making myself forget the fact that I was depressed.

Eh this post is a mess. My mind is in a mess, too. Whatever.",09Jul2020,1
21,"basically I got my 2002 subaru for free. for the two months my amazing bf worked to get it up and running - I got $800 worth of new parts, changed the oil, bought $600 tires. drove it *two weeks* and it just stopped driving. it‚Äôll shift into gear but just revs when you hit the gas to drive or reverse.

my bf was of course upset. I cried like I do. I was so stressed and frustrated with the car I wanted to give up. so I did. my great grandfather offered me a cheap 2000 toyota and I decided to cut my losses, I‚Äôve been saving my subaru to part out and try to get some of my money back selling the tires, etc.

well my bf has been saying he thinks it‚Äôs the shift linkage, not the tranny like I thought. I thought it would be hundreds of dollars to fix soooo I didn‚Äôt. after talking to my stepdad I learned it‚Äôs a $6 part. I bought a new car for nothing.

now I‚Äôm laying in bed awake trying to weigh my pros and cons. the subaru has 300k while the toyota has 160k, but the subaru has a brand new front end, brakes, struts...a lot more, just can‚Äôt remember car part names lol. I‚Äôll never get what I put into it back, so know that.

however the toyota is the unknown. I know my ggpa put a lot of work into it (it was crashed and he replaced the hood, everything in it) but it‚Äôs not the same. and I know the parts aren‚Äôt brand spanking new like the ones I have.

only issue is - the toyota is like ready for me to register. bill of sale, I signed the title, appointment at the dmv and everything. I feel like I totally effed up. I‚Äôm sorry if this isn‚Äôt a place to vent but holy shit I need to right now.",09Jul2020,1

I usually don't do well in social situations cus of social anxiety so I was kinda quiet, but still talked as much as I could and enjoyed the time and they clearly had fun too and was happy talking to me. I later messaged them to check up with them again and they responded, nothing unusual. I told them I'd love to chat more cus I wanna make new friends (I don't see anything weird with doing this this?) and they never responded. This person was so nice and cool and I was so excited about possibly making a new friend cus I rarely get that chance, and then they just ignore me.

23,"This could have been caused by any number of things, though I think in my case it was my codependency stemming from basically being treated like a doll by my mom growing up (and even still to this day tbh).

As I‚Äôve been growing out of this unhealthy codependency, one of the obstacles I‚Äôve hit along the way is that I don‚Äôt view myself as my own person ‚Äì not really. I was never really alone or in charge of how I spent my time enough to be able to grow and learn about myself as an individual with my own likes and dislikes, etc. I was also praised incessantly so I never had to fight for affection, all I had to do was do what I was told and I got that reward that all children covet.  Time went on and up to this point my only motivation to do things has been getting that same reward, only I‚Äôm an adult now and can‚Äôt live my own life if I‚Äôm relying on my perception of what other people think of me to regulate how I feel about myself.

As I‚Äôve viewed everyone else as a judge, I‚Äôve done what people who know they are being judged do ‚Äì I‚Äôve adjusted my output to other people to match what I think will give me the highest ‚Äòscore‚Äô; it seems to me that the primary cause of this is me not really knowing how to view people as anything other than judges, not knowing what it actually looks like to see things from other‚Äôs perspectives.

I always thought ‚Äúsee things from other people‚Äôs perspective‚Äù meant to look at all of their facts as your own, but something I‚Äôve been doing recently is actually looking around me as though I‚Äôm someone else, like I‚Äôm inside of their skull and I am them, and I look at my interactions with that person through their eyes. I try to hold in my mind some of their responsibilities as I look at those interactions and doing so has helped me see the people in my life as actual people and not judges. In a weird way, as I‚Äôve been practicing seeing things as other people, I‚Äôve been able to see things more as myself, like I‚Äôm distancing myself from them. It‚Äôs made me feel more responsible to adhere my actions to a moral code rather than just trying to act in a way that will get other people to give me a response that will make me to feel good about myself. It‚Äôs also made me less reactionary to the things going on around me, less focused on what other people in my life are doing and more focused on what I'M doing.

25,"A while ago, I made a few posts here about how I'm extremely lonely, with a very limited social life and a totally nonexistent dating life, how my family is not very close or supportive, and how years of effort to build on my social circle and make new connections have not really given me any results.

The most consistent advice that I've gotten to help cope with the crushing loneliness that I've been facing has been to focus on my hobbies and spend time doing things that I enjoy. The problem is that none of my hobbies can really be done from home - all of them require going out to places that are closed right now due to social distancing.

I've tried looking into new hobbies as well, but again, everything that interests me would require going out, and almost everything is closed. I am pretty much completely broke right now and can't really get into any hobbies that involve buying anything, either. With the pandemic going on, I really cannot do anything that I like to do.

In a nutshell, to update from my last post - Not only am I crushingly, paralyzingly lonely, I also can't do anything that I enjoy to cope with it, and probably won't be able to until the pandemic ends.",09Jul2020,1

I mean, I've heard some sort of less than nice people online, and that's fine, and I know if you play online you have to just grow thicker skin and all that. But, I was pretty excited to play and they both just kept calling me a fucking idiot/dumb and all that, and I just ended up feeling kind of bad after a bit and after that round was over I just didn't feel like playing much.

30,"What good is sadness. Can it be beneficial? Can it allow for truth or mask lies that one could only tell themselves. And if that sadness is shared, does it allow for the other fellow to participate in that dichotomy? I have been sad before. At the time of writing this I am sad for reasons that either I do not know simply refuse to address. I have shared my sadness with others. Very rarely does it backfire, to share ones personal sentiments. Many times it helps to share the load, whatever it may be, allowing for a more level headed approach to a solution. 

Personally, I cannot think of an example where one I‚Äôve been close with has manipulated my sadness into making me feel worse, yet I still feel as if they would, nay should, do as such. After introspection, yours truly realizes that it is an inward reflection my own self. I have betrayed my friends sadness before although not entirely intentionally. I think about it often as most of them remain my friends to this day, with some I feel as if I‚Äôve wronged them so as to never deserve any trust or forgiveness again, wether it is a constant flow of small jabs that I throw naturally in a teasing manner, attempting to be good natured, or more commonly, I think, using logical arguments to convince them that their own sadness is feigned. Again, in an attempt to be good natured. 

In both of these cases I feel as if I constantly blunder. I would never intentionally harm another human who I have nothing against, let alone a friend, let alone close friends. I view others roll harmless teases at their brethren in good nature that causes laughs all around, yet when I make an attempt, I seem to land on an insecurity of the other. Not by choice, nor intent,  but because I lack the ability to give out words of affirmation casually. That is after all what teases are. A tease should be a weapon of encouragement, designed to compare a current self, with a past self, the teasing represents how the person grows. It should not be to raise embarrassment (to an unhealthy extent). Most of the time however, I miss the mark, hurting my friends. The thing with these failed teases is they are toxic and destructive, because once said they can‚Äôt be taken back. An insult strait to the face can be retreated by a more humble individual after the incident. Whereas a tease is gone as soon as it‚Äôs said, however the damage lingers, building up in people until they feel as if it may as well be a punch in the face. 

I know what it‚Äôs like to be teased, brutally. For much of my life, I have been the victim of teasing in my friend group. Throughout middle school it was for being homeschooled, or my appearance, or awkwardness. In highschool, it switched to my quietness. The teasing in my life never formulated into a singular punch however. In my case (and not to be placed on a pedestal) the teasing endured so long without relief that I developed severe depression. The route was feeing the need to repress my true feelings out of a fear of being the awkward, unsocialized, homeschool kid. I never could carry on a casual conversation and I wasn‚Äôt allowed to share what was deep. I struggle with this even today, but that is for another tangent. 

So then. These feelings long repressed, of course come out the same way they came in. By teasing and putting others down. This is not justification. The problem is that I simply do not know how to remove it from my life. I try to be kind, but it is not natural for me, I am uncomfortable with Physical touch, Hopeless at giving proper words of affirmation, I feel like I don‚Äôt know those around me well enough to give gifts, I struggle with selflessness, And most of the time I am a bore and cannot give ‚Äúquality‚Äù time. I feel truly helpless. I have made valid attempts to improve all areas of my life, I still do actively, however with all my repressed emotions I feel like I will never arrive. Deep down I know I will eventually but the ‚Äòfeelings‚Äô (stupid things) remain. Even so, my inability to stop teasing, destroys me internally and most likely the other, whomever they may be. 


The latter issue is one much more complex. I have a tendency to use logic and reasoning to dismiss the feelings of others. This is, and never has been, in an attempt to invalidate their feelings, more so I just wish for them to see the ridiculousness in their sadness. If this sounds cruel, I‚Äôll say that most sadness is often over folly and ideally should be dismissed and forgotten. It is a burden to the bearer. 

-stopping that paragraph because I do sound like a true asshole. When I analyze myself and my actions I am a different human, more reasonable, more in touch with my empathetic self. The above is how I justify myself while committing the described action. I see things differently in different states of mind, sadly I am my most empathetic and understanding of others when I analyze myself. Making it hard to give others proper advice on their sadness, as I am analyzing them not myself. This circles back to being unable to show love/kindness very well. -

-That said, I‚Äôd like to continue on the tangent so to examine it and see why I justify it the way I do. -

Because I view most sadness as silly,(Obviously not true loss such as that of a loved one or true hardship), I tend to be blunt in my opinions on situations. For instance, if my friend is upset because he could not do X. I see it as silly because if you know that X cannot be done, why be sad about it. It wastes energy. I lack the required empathy of the short term feeling of disappointment found in those around me, that I only look to the far out situation, seeing most things as minor and irrelevant. 

-I struggle saying these things almost to the point of feeling at war with myself. I know these to be my natural responses, however in retrospect they always appear to be so disgusting. I certainly would not like a friend who abuses your vulnerability and sadness, no matter how small it is. I think the worst part is that when in this mindless state of apathy, I can respond aggressively to a denial of my ‚Äúwisdom‚Äù. I put my friend on the defensive and then can act in anger when they act accordingly. This apathetic beast claims the moral high ground and only it post humiliation does he step down.-

Logic isn‚Äôt an inherently bad way to dismiss pain. It is useful, especially to the more logically minded. It is a good tool for the right time, and used correctly can convince someone that life is worth living, (often times it is how I personally convince myself life is worth living). But the abuse of it. The manipulation. It is evil and I hate it yet I am it‚Äôs perpetrator. 

Circling back, I can‚Äôt think of a time someone close has down this to me, used my feelings against me, yet I do it.

And circling back, I can think of many times I was the victim of a cruel joke, yet even having stood in the shoes of embarrassment, I still condemn others to wear them. 

I truly am a bad friend, but not for the lack of trying, and certainly not all the time. I know I can be an incredibly relieving person to vent to. I can be a good listener and not to toot my own horn, but I can have some decent wisdom occasionally. It‚Äôs just that it goes unspoken. The pain I cause. The teasing. Manipulation which even when discussed never fully heals. Or at least it seems that way. 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm sad right now. Among other things, which I‚Äôll keep quiet about for now, I realize that I can be quite the bum on the log. A pain in the ass and mean person. That saddens me more than much else because I see no worth in such people. So then. What good is sadness? Can it be beneficial? While I‚Äôve discovered some truth. And unmasked some lies. So maybe just maybe, just this once, it was worth it. For what is the purpose of pain, if not to be better tomorrow.",09Jul2020,1
31,"I‚Äôm part of a support group for women who have been sexually/emotionally/physically abused, and a few weeks ago I posted asking for support. I added a small bit of my childhood sexual abuse.

I decided to just do it, and get that weight off my chest.

35,"I find digits, as in fingers and toes, really cute, attractive, and fun to play with. I love how they look especially if the nails are painted. I guess by extension, you could say that I have a foot and hand fetish, but I especially love those digits and fantasize about playing with them, massaging them, and sucking on them.

36,"I recently got out of a 5-year relationship and had my second therapy session today. My therapist recommended this mantra as a way to help me cope with the shame and guilt I've been feeling.

This has by far been the hardest year of my life. I was furloughed from work for 4 months, I lost the person who I thought I was going to marry and even bought a ring for. And on top of that, dealing with the immense stress of COVID. This year has been so hard for not just me, but I'm sure for so many other people.

I feel alone, anxious, sad, and so many other emotions. This mantra of forgiveness is something I plan to keep repeating to myself until it becomes true. I am sure there are so many people out there hurting right now, I hope this mantra can help some start a small but significant step towards healing.",09Jul2020,1
37,"This is going to sound really weird... legit think it's a real psychological disorder.

I am a relatively high-energy guy and have a demanding career. Last year I developed a bad infection from appendicitis and had to stay in the hospital extended care taking antibiotics for 5 days, spent another week in bed at home. It was the worst pain I have ever experienced and I hated it.

But for some reason - looking back months later, I kind of am having this weird nostalgia. The ""rush"" of not knowing what the issue was, going to the hospital, the attention from nurses and doctors, the stay in the hospital, laying there (in pain albeit) basically all day with nothing to do but heal, having food delivered to me, the pain meds, etc.

I think it is kind of crazy but the experience of the sickness, reward of figuring out what it was, relaxing, and then healing ... kind of liked it.",09Jul2020,1
38,"Yesterday was the worst day. From start to fucking finish. I woke up at 5am from a nightmare so horrible that I cried for 45 mins and couldn‚Äôt face going back to sleep. Decided to have a lazy day and treat myself to a macaroni cheese for lunch (am trying to lose weight so don‚Äôt indulge often), took one bite of it and my cat started hyperventilating. By the time I arrived to the vet an hour later she was frothing at the mouth and struggling to breathe. They kept her for 7 hours during which I was sure she would die. I live alone and don‚Äôt have many friends, my cat is my best friend and I was distraught. Finally got to pick her up late in the day and they still don‚Äôt really know what caused it. They think it might be a heart problem, so obviously that‚Äôs terrifying because that‚Äôs serious. But she was stabilised then and so they let me take her home and are ringing me today when the test results they sent to the specialist come back. My poor girl has a bunch of shaved patches and she was super miserable. It‚Äôs cost ¬£479 so far and I don‚Äôt know what the future tests and treatment will cost. I have insurance, but how it works is that I pay it first and then the insurance company pays me back. I wiped out my entire debit account and maxed out both credit cards which have taken me nearly two years to pay off. All my debt progress just gone. And then finally, as the cherry on the shit cake, my delivery of food for the week (which Tesco has already taken the money for) didn‚Äôt show up. I feel awful for the poor customer service woman I spoke to, because it was the last straw and I just bawled down the phone for a good ten minutes about my cat and now having no money and no food. She was an absolute champ and I appreciate what help she gave, but I still feel embarrassed for my reaction to missing groceries. So now I‚Äôm just sat on my sofa waiting for the vet to call at some point today and trying not to fear the worst.",09Jul2020,1

42,"Dear child of Nazareth,

Ask me why you hold those things around your fingers, 

These iron dreams contemptuous of those fevers

Which hold you locked around that hermetic knob

And twists and seals your room in thriving light

Your scented darkness remains the lingering shadow 

Wrapping these hands out in my prostration, 

I calculated this before it came to be, 

The future proofer I was I knew not what was the 

Random proponent of love that 

Struck from the smiling corners of my lips, Daisy. 

But this sovereign dimension turning my heart to it's

sweet caliber

I lost the morning that

Passed beyond your breath and

Began my solitude

I might only remember the future of my ancestors, 

The calling of bursting noon

And among these many hands I cannot decline

Too long

These cries from the end of the hoof are 

the witless species that we are 

holding on to these 

cold several minutes,

laying down seaside chalk only to be beaten

by an ocean's wrath.",09Jul2020,1

50,NOW I CAN FULFILL MY HOPES AND DREAMS!,09Jul2020,1
51,"I  met her through a mutual friend a few months ago and we would chat and  play games on Discord nearly every day. Even though I don't know her  super well, she'd open up about her past problems as well as a current  one and it obviously had her down, but I had a chat with both her and  the mutual friend (who she has known for years) and we both told her  that we're here for her if she needs anything. There are also a few  others on the same Discord server who I fully believe would have her  back, and at least one of them is also a good friend of hers. She has  also talked about her parents and they seem reasonable, so I imagine she  could talk to them as well. She also mentioned she has a  psychologist/psychiatrist (?) but that she has had trouble booking time  or something like that recently.

The  reason I think she's done it is that sometime last week her problems  became worse from what I understood, and she hasn't been online on Steam  or Discord for nearly 3 days. It might not seem like a lot, but before  she was always online, even when not hanging out and/or playing games.  She'd always have the online or away status. But she's been straight up  offline for days, and it scares the shit out of me. She was my only  friend that would talk to me extensively about her life, and the only  one I felt comfortable talking to as such.

She  lives in a different country and I know her first name, age and what  she looks like as well as a broad location where she lives, but my only  ways to contact her are Steam and Discord, and I have no idea if she has  Facebook, Twitter, anything like that where I could possibly find  information. I tried looking, but nothing turned up. Our mutual friend  also lives in the same country, over an hour drive away AFAIK. I don't  think he knows exactly where she lives or has her number or anything,  because I talked to him and he seems none the wiser, but agreed that  it's a little worrying. I figure he would've called her to check up on  her or something.

I'm just hoping  she took some time for herself unannounced but it doesn't help the  constant sense of dread I've had for a few days now, and I can only  distract myself from it briefly with work, games or such.

I  had several dreams where she logged on again and messaged me, and then I  woke up and realized she didn't. It's fucking soul crushing and I don't  know what the fuck I'll do with myself if she's gone.",09Jul2020,1
52,"I just was writing to myself because I was frustrated and while I was jotting down a wall of text I made a statement that formulated how I feel: 

""All my friends are people I've reached out to""

I've always grown up super frustrating, I didn't have friends, my brother hated me and a horrible school system where teachers legitimately harassed me for personal things every day, I was the annoying kid. with that, I am still proud of who I am, and that I've always been vocal and stood up for myself. 

To keep myself from hurting I worked on being the most me I could. The only thing I had deep identity issues with is how I reacted and functioned in my environment.  I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression since I was 7 but I'm a very engaging open happy (""bubbly"" teachers would describe me as) person.

keep in mind with all this because I grew up so alone, I am ok with and used to being alone, but since have been for such a long time I'm sorta sick of it. 

 I feel weirdly unable to physically show when I'm down in the dumps. I'm always talkative, I'm always opinionated and my clothes are bright and fun. I've had whole school years what were deeply depressing but when I got to class I couldn't shut up and I couldn't stop myself from having fun, I have always looked ok.  it was just when I got home I was intensely exhausted and frustrated both with my situation and myself. 

 I have grown and learned that is just who I am and I cannot do anything about the fact that I am extroverted and engaging as a person, don't get me wrong I love being me! I love myself a lot! 

But, as i""m growing and as I'm getting out of places like school and looking at how I've handled things as well as accumulated the people who are around me, I'm seeing that I'm the most engaging person in my own life, my friends are always people who I've gone towards and chosen to be around, people like me but even my own friends say I'm intimidating and appear fine on my own.  

High school was the first time that I got friends, I went to peoples houses I did Halloween and to small band gigs and as I am getting out of high school I'm realizing people never came up to me and told me they wanted to be my friend, no one told me that they had a crush on me, no one. I know there were people who thought I was cool, I wore what I wanted and people liked that, I sometimes got complements but that's different.  

I know as a friend my maturity and wisdom has legitimately affected my friends. many have told me they engage life differently bc I've helped them make sense of a lot of things that weren't clear to them from basic conversations. But as a stable pillar, I have no idea who to talk to, it's not like I'm this teacher to all my friends, I'm not someone who takes care of them that's not how friendships work but talking to people about my issues feels like they are not prepared to talk to me about things, they're dealing with their things in such a way it removes them from being able to even discuss anything else.  

I don't have many friends, 4 on and off online but I don't feel comfortable randomly starting a conversation from a thought popping in my head to any of them, most of them I've known for at least 3 years. All have their reasons, maybe due to their personal lives being frustrating and I don't want to bother them, maybe one Is autistic and we need a certain form of communication that I don't have the energy to engage in, I just want to bring up something like ""how do you interpret how this thing works?"" basic stuff that feels like a burden. 

This all texting, btw, I am fine with talking to people I can see their face I can interpret what's going on pretty well but this isn't how we communicate most of the time, especially now. 

Maybe I'm frustrated with being young, maybe the city I'm in doesn't match my energy,  regardless for a long time I have felt very alone.",09Jul2020,1
54,"Since quarantine began I've been super stressed out; schedule changes, not getting to see my SO as much as I want to, University still maintaining classes online (with somehow even more course load), and a good old Valium relapse (my brain convinced me that this would help with the stress and anxiety). 

I've wrapped up all of my courses as of Tuesday and I'm now almost two weeks off of the diazepam. My head and body finally feel clear, like a weight has been lifted from my spirit. I'm looking forward to using my free time to pursue some relaxed learning and hobbies; I think I'm also getting used to the quarantine which is a real plus. 

I think the relapse was a lesson mostly because I didn't use for a long time before I stopped, maybe about 2 or 3 weeks (didn't keep count), and that helped me to see the pronounced effects it had on my perception and thinking. This includes the withdrawal which I'm currently battling. I don't crave it nor do I feel like I need it and I think that's because I read a little on the negative effects and withdrawal symptoms and am aware of what's happening, plus I realised that it isn't actually helping my mood or anxiety anymore. It was just hurting me. Addiction is weird and complicated and I hope that finally acknowledging the negatives of the drug helps me to not fall prey to its whispers of hope when I'm stressed out again. For some context, valium is dirt cheap where I live and even though it's a prescription drug, some pharmacies will sell it to you without one. That aside, my mom occasionally uses it as a sleep aid and has a 2""√ó3"" ziploc baggie full of the 10mg ones. In other words, there's incredibly little in the way of me using if I want to.

But life is always going to be hitting you with bricks to be honest, and it's important to find a healthy way to cope. My next lesson will be coping without a relapse and I'll get to learn how to deal with stress and pressure in a better way. I really believe introspection, self evaluation and properly educating yourself can help if you struggle with drug use, and for now I'm enjoying my pink cloud. Wish me well guys, I feel awake and great.",09Jul2020,1

57,"Okay, so. Growing up, my parents were really overpotective enough to keep telling me what and what not to do. Afraid of disappointing them, I never really became the type to disobey their rules (completely), as I also try my best to become the daughter they keep wanting me to be.

However, that just made me too calculating on when to tell and ask them things that *‚ÄúI think‚Äù* they would hardly approve of. 

For instance, I‚Äôm now in my 20s but I‚Äôm still afraid to even ask them if I could go to a sleepover. (*i‚Äôm asian btw &amp; i‚Äôm also an only daughter living in a quite conservative culture, so i guess that would explain the overprotectiveness?*)

My friends and older siblings keep telling me to just be more brave enough next time to ask my parents things as ‚Äúrisky‚Äù as these, because they think I‚Äôm one whose just too afraid to ask (which is true, btw).

However, I still don‚Äôt want to disappoint them because I know that their disappointment and disapproval of the ‚Äúchanged‚Äù me will just negatively affect me in the end. 

But that also rubbed me off of lots of fun experiences and opportunities, too, especially now that I‚Äôm already in my 20s where I should try to get to explore the world more and stuff.

I‚Äôve wanted to break from this cycle for a long time now but I still don‚Äôt know how to get past this.

60,"Please help me!! I (15F) met a guy online in a conference. We met for about one week ago and while we were on a call, he told me he likes me. I didn't know what to think because it had been little time, but I was kind of expecting it since he had been really sweet and charming and funny with me, he would compliment me everyday. And he's never been in a relationship before btw. Now, after that call (this Monday) everything became awkward between us. We barely talk and I'm the one who always makes the efforts to keep the conversation going. I must say that I'm the one who always texts first (he did so just two times). And I asked him if he found me annoying or clingy and he said he actually loves that about me (the fact that I always write him). However, we had arranged another call for Wednesay (yesterday) and he cancelled it because of his parents. Then I suggested to re-program the call, and he said ""yeah, tomorrow?"" (notice he was the one who suggested the day). And I agreed with him. But today I wrote him ""heyy"" because I didn't want us to be awkward or anything like that, and he hasn't replied yet (And he has been online several times). I don't know what to do now. This guy was really nice with me for the first week but now he seems to be distant and cold. I'm not even sure if the fact that he said he likes me is true or not (I asked him if he does mean the things he told me and he responded yes, but I'm not sure tho). I know my issue may seem really dumb and small compared to others, but I really want to know what to do. I don't want to stop talking to me, especially since it is supposed he likes me and if I must be honest, I kind of like him too and can picture us together in the future.

I grew up with my sick and narcissistic mother, separated from my alcohlic to a father. As the oldest sibling I took a lot of responsibility and grew up way too fast. I started to stutter and I was deeply afraid that I was causing my mother more problems.

I have always been a high achiever and excelling in school. At the age of 10 I participated in a national championship in Scrabble and scored pretty good considering I only faced adults. For a time this was the thing I loved and found meaning in and it was all I did all day. 

With time I got bored of it and decided that my dream was to become a doctor after watching ER at 9-10 years of age. The dream lasted and 2-3 years later I bought several medical books and took them to school to study them when I had time over. I also did this at home. To become the world‚Äôs greatest doctor like my heroes in ER (in my opinion) was my biggest dream and I made sure people knew about it.

The stuttering became worse and worse and it really dragged me down. I also got diagnosed with a disease I did not have (ME/CFS) and I fought really hard to win over those who thought I was sick, especially my mother who in a way gave me the diagnosis by thinking that I had it and then by finding a doctor who was willing to diagnose me with it. The main thing with this disease is that it is dangerous to push yourself mentally and physically, which I did to overcome this obstacle which took 6 months. It was really a hard period physically and mentally, but I hit the strongest form of my life because of it and since then it has gone downhill.

I still excelled at school and achieved a lot academically, but fast forward a few years I lost my interest to become a doctor, but since it was my only dream I held on to it. In my world I must achieve a great career and be the best at what I do. I also went to an elite high school, where I was one of the best in class. I refused to let go of my dream to become a doctor and it became a must do, which killed the dream even further. 

I got sick at school and felt that I was ready for college on year left in high school and fought without meaning and purpose during my last year. It was then the depression hit me as I realized I did not want to become a doctor and my whole life felt like a lie. In that period everything lost its purpose. I had nothing to fight for, nothing that I wanted to achieve anymore. I felt like I hade already done that earlier in life academically and now I am completely stuck. I know that I must find meaning in other things, but it is not possible for me right now. I feel that everyday that goes by is a missed opportunity to become something and I am starting to feel like a doomer, whose opportunities are all blown away in the wind. So now I am living in my own apartment with my wonderful girlfriend that is the only thing that brings me joy, but I am afraid that I am going to lose her or drag her down because of this.

Sorry for the long post, but I need some advice that can help me get moving again...

Have a nice day :)",09Jul2020,1

I'm starting later than most people at 21, but like they say, the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. Second best time is today. I considered going into a trade or doing a short (1-2 year) medical program just so I could get out of warehouse work sooner, but I don't think I'd really be happy with those.

I‚Äôve got university in September and there‚Äôs a chance that‚Äôll be online so I‚Äôll have to stay at home where I‚Äôll have to put up with my toxic sibling who despises me and makes my life so much harder than it has to by unnecessary drama which he THRIVES on. 

Constantly creates lies about me, demonizes me, and blames shit on me. He‚Äôs also disgusting to live with too, and no one else in my household even cares. 

So he hates me because I‚Äôm the only one who calls him out for this shit. 

Then I‚Äôve got uni which may not even happen. I have to work a shit job for the meantime (yay!) and that‚Äôs for another four years of my life... 

Then I can reach my goal of moving country and living someplace else, living my own fucking life for once with the chance of finding happiness, as I won‚Äôt here with him....

72,"My boyfriend is 20 and was recently diagnosed with OCD. One of his main symptoms is confessing to any bad or weird things he has ever done. Sometimes his OCD even makes up memories to feel guilty for and we've proven some of them wrong.  Most of the confessions are laughable but this isn't. He confessed 2 days ago and I'm so disgusted!! He admitted to having a phase of really liking incest porn when he was 13/14, and losing interest in it by the time he was 15. He said he recalls thinking about his mom in a sexual way a handful of times. He reckons he might've read something about mom/son sex and maybe he just thought ""oh what if?"" and that's all it was. He is adamant he never would have done anything with his mom and was never attracted to her and is ashamed of all this. 

He put it down to 13 year old desperation, that maybe he thought ""if no girl ever shows interest in me would I get desparate enough to do something with my mom?"". I am so repulsed reddit. He has apolosgied over and over and has made it clear he never creeped on her nor  thought about her while masterbating nor stole her underwear and liked girls his own age or celebrities at the time. We've spent hours and hours discussing this and I have no idea what to do? My heart is breaking. We are best friends that never fight. We were hoping to move in together in a few months.",09Jul2020,1
74,"July is Parks and Recreation Month, a time to enjoy the parks around us (in a safe fashion) for the betterment of our health and to appreciate nature around us and the people who help maintain the parks. On Thriving Thursday, we ask our readers to thrive in good health, strive for better health, and offer support to men with BPH. BPH is a common condition of prostate enlargement in older men, usually accompanied by frequent urination day and night, slow urinary flow, and more uncomfortable urinary symptoms. By spreading awareness, we can help men care for their health and prevent BPH from decreasing their quality of life.¬†

The consequences of BPH include less sleep, less energy during the day from lack of sleep, fixation on the nearest bathroom instead of living in the moment, and a health concern in the bladder and kidney areas (untreated BPH could mean a more narrow or completely blocked urethra, as well as kidney and bladder damage such as stones).¬†

This Thriving Thursday, men with BPH can take walks in the park (while practicing social distancing) to get fresh air and increase physical activity. Parks and greenery also offer a space for mindfulness meditation and stress reduction. Physical activity is one recommendation for BPH management, especially in mild cases where urologists have told their BPH patients to practice watchful waiting.¬†

BPH is not just a prostate issue- having a natural, holistic approach to BPH symptom management (the mind, the body, the bladder, pelvic floor, etc.) may be your solution to finding relief!¬†

Tell us how you thrive regardless of BPH! Read and share this BPH blog so others can learn more and get encouragement for their BPH!",09Jul2020,1
75,"Everytime I notice myself change, I tend to look behind and compare my old self to my new self.
I don't know why I always tend to then always feel like this ""new me"" is a product of the time and mental head space and then I question whether this is the real me or am I just pretending.
The new or current me feels confident in bouts and off&amp;on feels like chosing myself over toxic people is the better more healthier way of living.
The main point of self doubt arises when I compare how difficult it was for me to detach from my toxic ass ex, why is that when he left me I felt fucked up but now when few of my friends don't have the same equation with me anymore I don't seem to be giving enough of a fuck.
I am so afraid that somewhere because of my horrible mental health I've started becoming too protective about the ""ego"" since that's what starts any form of psyche destructions. I just fear being on the side of hurt for anyone, and still I constantly want to protect myself.
That too much seems too hard honesty.

76,"Maybe I'm too young to understand, but cripes has it been rare for me to find any reasonable, cool-headed attempt at discussing the area's geopolitics with genuine, deep thought about helping those who live in the region. Hardly the only subject like this, I'm well aware, but even Covid-19 and Trump don't measure up.

Everything just seems to root back into the immediate politics, and irrelevent grudges, of the western world. It's so pervasive that I genuinely have little definite idea as to what's actually going on down there these days, and honestly makes the whole thing just look like groups of competing conservative fundamentalists.

79,"My boss let us all start working from home and we closed our doors to the public. We let our receptionist go because she couldn't work from home (no internet access)

I stepped up and took over all of her duties besides answering the phones and I'm the only one with access to everyone's computers to cover them when they're out. And there have been at least 2 people out practically every single day for the last 3 weeks. 

At first when we started working from home a few months back I was really excited. Everything continued as normal. Only difference was that I wouldn't see coworkers. 

But lately this feeling had been creeping in on me. This feeling that I wasn't doing enough for anybody and I was a waste of resources.. i began feeling like I was a fraud and even though I'm licensed like everyone else I felt like I must have cheated my way in or it was somehow easier for me to get in compared to everyone else and therefore, it was less earned. 

But today, a coworker told me I was a Rockstar and another told me i was always there when she needs me, which is all the time.

These were the two coworkers I felt I was most neglecting because I've taken on so many new responsibilities that Ive been having a hard time keeping up with helping people out one on one like I used to do. 

Their compliments really lifted my spirits. I know I'm more fortunate than a lot of people who are going through these times but it was really heartwarming to be told I was making a difference in someone's day at work. 

I'm going to look for an online therapist or something because I recognize the bad feelings aren't normal. I honestly think the stress of everything happening has gotten to me. But today I'm really happy and feel like I've helped someone.",09Jul2020,1

85,"Life feels like a lot and the choices I‚Äôve made to get here feel like a lot. 

I think I took the wrong steps, and it cost me the kind of life I‚Äôve always wanted. 

I‚Äôm less than a month from 29. I always thought I‚Äôd have a kid by now and an adoring husband that made me feel loved and wanted and safe. I thought I‚Äôd have a career. I‚Äôm in school. I‚Äôve got 3 more years if I go at the pace I‚Äôm going, and when I graduate - I‚Äôve been looking at the job listings and these crazies want to pay $13/hr in a major city for an entry level position? What? I‚Äôll be 32, making $13/hr?

I‚Äôm dating a wonderful man. For almost two years. Recently he tried to break up with me because I‚Äôm controlling and no fun. He doesn‚Äôt make me feel loved, he makes me doubt myself around every corner and says more kind things about stranger girls in the street or the gym than he does about me. Even though from the beginning I saw a future together, he says the spark is gone that made him feel that way. I‚Äôm afraid it will never come back. 

I know I can‚Äôt dwell on these things. I know I‚Äôm still relatively young and have time to change things. But I don‚Äôt want another man. I‚Äôve only had eyes for him these years. I love his family. I‚Äôm just so sad. If I leave, I leave this city that I love. I‚Äôd have to go back to my parents to continue school. I don‚Äôt get along with them when I live with them and that sounds like hell. I hate the town they live in, and the state. 

I have a crappy part time job. It barely pays my car payment. 

I have to get out of this state of mind. I know I do. I need some coffee or a Diet Coke and sunshine. And exercise.... although I slipped a disk in my lower back 4 days ago and I‚Äôm really limited on my mobility. I just want to be sad for a moment.",09Jul2020,1

87,"Today's my birthday! 

This year I wanted to do something different. My boyfriend's family has really taught me the value of being charitable - during our weekly happy hours (that started up at the beginning of lockdown), one person chooses a cause they'd like to everyone to donate to. It's been so fulfilling, especially because of helping causes that mean something special to people I consider my family. 

I started my fundraiser a couple of weeks ago to fall on National Give OUT Day, which is the national day of giving to LGBT causes marked by the end of Pride month. Growing up, I was bullied for being gay. So it made complete sense to raise money for GLSEN - an organization whose mission is to end bullying and harassment of LGBTQ+ students. 

I sent the word out to family, friends, and coworkers, and as of this morning, the total amount has reached $6.2K (and counting)! I could not be more excited. Regardless of being in a crazy pandemic situation, this has turned into one of the best birthdays to date.",09Jul2020,2

2 years ago I entered in college and I meet some of the most incredible persons I have ever meet and I really connected with them and for the first time I could trust someone.

But a couple months ago something happen which I don't like to talk about ( both parties were wrong) and I lost almost everyone.

Since then I only was able to recover a friendship and it hurts me.

I found out they were in town this next week to hang out. I was with some of them for like 5 minutes and I felt like I wanted more than that and I wanted to be friends again with them. So somehow I want to change things. I already said sorry and I asked for one more chance and they said no. But it was via text and I don't think they could really feel that I was different and deserved another chance.

I really like these guys and would like to be with them again as friends.

But idk I've always loved him but I feel like he hasn't been doing enough to help me with this situation. Everytime I tell him to call the police on my mom or I ask him when are we gonna move he says to give him time. But it's been years I can't keep living like this. In a few years I won't even need to wait for him. Also because if him moving out I see him less often so I guess that created distance between us.

They threatend to kick me out when my grades suffered due to my ED and repeatedly traumatised me for not ""pulling my socks up"". **The normalisation of poor mental health in GCSE and A-Level Students is toxic.** No child should require mental health support from simply attending school. Schools NEED to be a more nurturing environment for their students because our mental health matters. Young people are facing unprecedented pressures in their lives, which are contributing to mental health problems including anxiety, depression, self-harm and eating disorders. In this article, I tell my extremely personal story of mental health in school, and encourage you to follow the links and spread the word of the incredibly important campaigns I highlight to end the stigma of mental health in schools. There is more to life than A-Levels and exams, and the belief that grades are more important than mental health are putting many of our peers at a risk. A risk which everybody can see but nobody feels they can seriously talk about. The normalisation of '***exam depression***' is toxic and indicates that we MUST seek change. We must end this stigma by creating a comfortable environment surrounding mental health in our schools.. The government must be held to account. Our schools are facing a mental health crisis. We are failing the next generation if we don't stand up against it. It's time for things to CHANGE. Whether to raise awareness of and end the stigma surrounding mental health issues or to ensure our government is held to account, **please read and share my article**. To your friends, family, on social media, your school, local MP - anyone you feel could benefit from reading it! We are facing the biggest mental health emergency of our lifetime.

101,"My sister is fourteen years older than me. I'm sixteen. She is a fully grown woman who should be on her own by now, but no. About a year ago, she and her kids (8F, 7M, 5M) ran into some issues and moved back into our dad's. 

Now, after raising four other kids, it was just me, my dad, and my stepmom for five years. We moved to a small town, into a small house, into a small school. I spent the first three/four years adjusting and getting used to small-town life, getting used to the different people. And, last year, I got it down. After being a shadow my entire life, I finally found a way to be someone. My family is poor, so I couldn't be the popular kid who wore brand names or sports the fancy new phone or watch or whatever. So, I decided to study, read, get good grades, AND I decided to join the Football and Basketball team. After a few weeks at the beginning of (last year) school year, I knew I did the right thing. I was a freshman, one of the smartest kids in school, and one of the star athletes. I made lost of friends, joined lots of clubs, became the Vice President of one or two. Life was good. Life was great. I even got a local business saying they were willing to hire me when I turned Sixteen, so there was something to look forward to. With a way to make money, I could actually get into college, if I saved up enough. 

After a solid year of being everything I wanted to be, school ended and summer began. Que the parties and late-night practices, am I right? 

Wrong! Why? Because my sister moved in with us over the summer. She has three kids. It's no big deal, I'll be busy anyway, football and basketball practice, along with hanging with friends and learning to drive. Right?

Wrong, again! You see, my Stepmother and Father both worked, and my Sister was going through withdrawal, so guess who was forces to quit going to practice and watch three of the most misbehaved kids to ever exist? Me. 

I have kicked off the team after missed ten practices. It's fine, I can try out after school starts back up, right? 

Wrong! My sister recovered! Horray! But she spent all of her savings on drugs and now needs a job to save up to get a car and an apartment, so she'll be staying with us for another few months. But, you may be wondering, ""if she is working, who is watching the kids?""

Me. Of course. Who else? Their mother? Hahaha. 

I had to quit every single group I was in. I wasn't allowed to join any sports. I couldn't even work out because every hour of my free time was spent watching those fucking kids. And they never behave. They break shit, they make noise for no reason, they stomp when they walk, and they scream all day long. 

It's fine though, only a few months, right? 

Wrong! For some reason, she cant seem to make enough money to get an apartment. So I have to watch the kids for even longer. 

My only free time is when they are asleep, so I spend that time alone, playing the PS4 because that is all I have the energy for. It is my only stress output, so I play it for a few hours, until around Two A.M. Then, I go to sleep and wake up at Six for school. Naturally, I am no longer getting good grades. Months of pint up anger and stress gets let out through snipping and snapping at teachers and friends. I feel so angry all the time because the fucking kids stole everything I had. 

I get in trouble more often for swearing at teachers and yelling at people who annoy me. I always feel like shit afterward, but I'm just so angry. 

I get in fights. I lose all my friends. My girlfriend dumps me because we no longer talk, I am no longer the football star, and after months of not being able to work out, I've gotten fat. 

Not only am I now angry all the time, I now feel like shit and am sad 24/7. It's fine. Only a few more months. I can always look forward to playing the PS4 after a long day of watching the kids, right?

WRONG! Due to my poor performance in school and constantly getting in trouble, my parents take away my T.V and my PS4. Great. But not all is lost, its been almost a year, I turned Sixteen. My parents know how much I want to work and make money and go to college. So, I ask them If we can make an arrangement so I can work as well. 

Nope.

""Oh, you want to save up money and go to college so you don't end up like a useless piece of shit like your brothers and sisters? No, no, no, not here. You need to watch your sister's kids.""

Then quarintine hit. They still work, all day. I am forced to watch these kids all day. I don't know how I manage it. I am still so fucking angry all the time, but I'm more sad than anything right now. I know that my life is shit. I will never escape this shithole of a life and family. I am destined to be just like my sister. 

So... Now I just do everything they need, and, at the end of the day, I just lay in bed and stare at the ceiling dreaming of what could of been, what I could have been. Dreaming of games I never got to play, parties I missed, my ex-girlfriend, my friends. All gone. 

So, thanks Sister. You are the singular worst person I've ever known. You are the worst possible excuse for a parent in history.",09Jul2020,3

I became pretty stressed, it was hard to have a small chat with people or look them in the eye. Before that I was a very bubbly guy, wearing my heart on my sleeve and talking to anyone. I started having obsessive thoughts and feeling and thinking that I'm never good enough, constantly torturing myself with all kinds of ways to better myself. I was seeking women, but all I found were empty one (or a few) night stands, that in the end made me feel empty and even more sad. Eventually I stopped doing all drugs but weed and I was slowly regaining my sanity. At some point I lived with my work mate, but we were not getting along much and it was rocky. I decided to live on my own. 80 percent of my wage was spent on bills, but I was happy, I had my peace again. I started smoking much less weed to not have to worry about bills too. Then at some point I changed company divisions and met a girl. Fast forward to now, I'm not smoking weed at all, I can get emotionally involved with people again and I am impatiently waiting for my daughter, that I will meet next month. I am very grateful for how my life has turned around and I am happy I've not given up and killed myself, like I was thinking when my drug abuse has led me to some very dark corners of my mind. I hope that all of you struggling stay strong and remember that life will not always be so hard, you've got to carry forward until the sun will shine again.",09Jul2020,1
104,"At first I was just afraid of the lack of in person interaction and craved virtual interactions with my friends as a way to feel connected, now any time my friends meet up virtually or send messages I just feel really depressed because I don‚Äôt feel as connected to them as I used to. I have a lot of fears of people not liking me and with things going virtual it just feels like we don‚Äôt get genuine enough interaction to really push past that so I‚Äôve just gotten in the habit of avoiding it all. Even when someone reaches out one on one and I want to hear from them it feels like a huge chore to come up with what to respond. I‚Äôm getting more and more distant from all my friends and really worry how I‚Äôll get back to normal when we‚Äôre able to see each other again",09Jul2020,1
105,"I always had no problems with everyone and was known as the guy that could be relied on. For the past week going party after party I tore those close to me and my friends, ruining my self-esteem, pride and overall image as the  ‚Äòchill laid back dude with no problems‚Äô. This made those ‚Äòfriends‚Äô lose respect towards me. 

It all began on the first party where I felt excluded from my boys and was given the image of a ‚Äòfuckboy‚Äô. It was all in good fun cause that‚Äôs the kind of shit I‚Äôm used to hearing that after dating school classmates. This made me think that I wanted to change that image and be better. I started to drink hoping it would go away and as a personal step towards a new me...I was wrong to do that.

I began getting REALLY close with a close friend (F)Like intense cuddling knowing I was drunk. I never felt more ashamed of what I did after and to who. 
The next day comes, new frat party. I see the same girl except she is in tears and wanted to talk. I began worrying that I did something really regrettable. I did. She was told by her friends that last night (the first party) I slid my hand halfway into her pants. I couldn‚Äôt believe it surely I would remember doing this to someone. But both of us had no memory of it happening. Instincts told me I would still have to apologize even if I don‚Äôt remember doing and taking such unfair advantage of her. We both moved past it for the first half of the party and all was supposed to be well. 

Her friend came storming to my face screaming ‚Äúdid you slide your hand into her?‚Äù. Now embarrassed, confused and curious. Asking if I actually did do such a thing last night? Both of them now in front of me bringing them to a private room. The friend explaining how it actually happened and that I took advantage of her as a women. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. Me doing this to someone I known for 5 years and onwards, someone who I considered a super close friend. I went on apologizing for my actions and including that I have no memory of it. She accepted my apology whilst broken and clearly crying. I felt like the worst human being.

I ask this subreddit, help me find a way for me to reclaim my trust, respect and appreciation for women and school friends. I ask this since I want to approach the next following week with a new name and image for the better. What should I do?",09Jul2020,1

114,"So I am a guy still in high school, a junior, and I've dealt with the same thing my entire school life. I feel like I am average looking, I am top 50 in our grade of about 1000 people, and I honestly think I'm a little above average when it comes to being physically fit (I work out constantly and feel like I am in great shape, and can bench 250 pounds). I am always down to help people with something, I think I am pretty outgoing, and always enjoy a good laugh, but I'm the person where if you don't talk to me I won't say anything.

Out of all of that, it seems that whoever I talk to, no matter who it is, always points out that I'm short. I am 5'8 for reference, and I feel bad for being upset about it because I should feel grateful for all that I stated above and how there are people a lot shorter than me who deal with a lot worse. But its always the only thing I hear, like everyone just needs to point it out. I know (or at least hope) its never in a rude way, but people seem to always mention how ""oh you're too short for that"", ""oh, you couldn't do it, you look too young"" , ""I can't take you seriously sometimes"",or just a whole plethora of other stuff. It used to be way worse for me, where I was 4'8 in 6th grade, but all the constant remarks make me want more than anything just to be taller. I feel like its always the thing I hate about myself, because it seems to be the only thing people focus on. It just sucks so much in particular cause I can NEVER get mad about it, cause then I get the whole ""Oh come on, heights just a number"" or ""Did I strike a nerve"" or ""Come on, you're not even THAT short, you've got nothing to complain about"". If I'm not that short why is it the only thing I ever hear. I never get complimented, and the best I can get is some banter with my friends like ""Oh of course you already finished that"" or ""its the MINI HULK"".

TL/DR I feel pretty good about myself, but everyone seems to only point out my height. Is it just that I have selective hearing or is it really that if you're under 5'11 people always give you this crap

116,"A friend from back in high school lives on the beach and often sends me pics of the beautiful girls right outside his back door on a daily basis. He kind of rubs my nose in the fact he  has the perfect setup to meet beautiful young women. He recently confessed to getting bored of the young ones and said he wouldn't mind meeting an older woman. I have the perfect setup to encounter older women, so I offered to switch houses with him for a year. At least once every two weeks a senior citizen will escape the rest home from down the road and walk past my house naked. I explained that where I live, mature women just come right to you. If I can just get him to put it in writing before he agrees to the swap, I'll be living at the beach for a year! (But seriously, sometimes the senior citizen is a dude and one asked me for a beer. Damn it, if he managed to break out, he deserves to drink a  beer naked on my porch while he waits for the van to come get him!)",09Jul2020,1
