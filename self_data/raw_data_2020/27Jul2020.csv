- [ ]i  work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there normally named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were and when our is. Sue asked me ‚Äòhow old are you?‚Äô (I was nothing to do with the convo up until this point) and I said ‚Äò29‚Äô then she reacted ‚Äòawwwww are yer?‚Äô 

- [ ] Then sue asked me ‚Äò when‚Äôs your birthday?‚Äô I said ‚Äò30th November‚Äô then Sam out loud said ‚Äòmines 21st‚Äô in a bubbly up herself kinda way. Then sue  (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‚Äòoh close birthdays eh, are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?‚Äô Jokingly as i said and then said sam whilst tagging clothes was like  ‚Äòooooo no, ooo no ooooo no, ooo no I don‚Äôt think my fella would like that, don‚Äôt think my fella would like that‚Äô   and looked annoyed a bit too but really arrogant too as she was tagging a shirt. Then it just went quiet. 


-she‚Äôs always been really pleasant with me and friendly in a normal person way but  I feel she got annoyed by the joke because I‚Äôm ugly and yet she stinks very very  bad of BO (the staff talk about it behind her back) and looks like a complete junkie. She wears the same grey tracksuit that‚Äôs delinquents wear everyday that she got locked up in.


- [ ] I didn‚Äôt say anything was I ripped and basically called ugly here? Her bf is in prison whilst she‚Äôs in on community service and he does call A her often in the shop but she also checks out other dudes sometimes. And fancied another guy in the shop ( so sue said) and he ripped her to bits to me about how much she smells.

Edit: she‚Äôs Normally nice and she seems pleasant etc with me never had a problem with her before",27Jul2020,1

5,"I‚Äôm a young guy and went to my job adviser of one month she had chose me forward for a job interview. and she asked me do I need interview clothes ( polite/bubbly tone of voice) i said ‚Äòno thanks iv got all that‚Äô and her response was ""oh, have you got all that? (Bubbly Tone of voice as I said) and then she said ‚Äò ok well do you know how to conduct yourself on an interview"" while looking at me pleasantly with furrows eyebrows , (see I‚Äôm very shy and quiet) I said ‚Äòyes‚Äô she went on to say (she used her hands as gestures in motion to what she was saying) ""ok, well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes....make sure you get a shave. make sure you cut your nails. make sure you do you're hair up all nice and that"" (in a voice between a mix of bubbly and assertive) then she paused a bit looking at her computer and then said ""and make sure you put some aftershave on as well, for the girls make sure it's men's"" then she burst out laughing. I just smiled with it. She said it nicely judging by a laugh at the end but idk. i wasn't near clean shaven at the time of the appointment tbh) but always was previous appointments. she sent me an email the next day about it saying about what I need to take with me to the interview and at the bottom it had underlined ‚Äòplease dress smartly‚Äô and ‚Äògood luck‚Äô
Edit- the next interview she chose me for I had the next week she never said anything like this at all again and she filled out the application form for me for it and I didn‚Äôt ask",27Jul2020,1
6,"We met in 11th grade and became good friends she helped me through a lot of things, was always there and helped with all her heart. She was always bright and one of the realest, she encouraged me to confess my love to my gf and the list goes on. 

(Let's call her G and her bf H)

G met H at work. She told us about him after they made ""love"". She told us how amazing and nice he was. She was so in love and I were so happy that she way happy. They started of a F+ which was hard since she had serious feelings for him. She told me what agony it was. I told her either tell him or let it be or the pain will always grow. 

When I met him frist I thought he was a chill dude always had a smile on his face. G and H started hanging out togehter more and more soon she lived at his. Things went so fast. I visited them often because I wanted to hang out with G and it was nearly impossible to get her out or talk only with her H was always there, always listening. 

H was an heavy stoner and G dispised weed and H somehow got her into smoking it. I didn't thought it was bad since people change and try new things. 
I once visited them together with my gf after that she told me that she thought there was something strange about H  and she didn't felt comfortable there. I should have listened to her. 

I visited them at least twice a week since G told her sister and best friend never want to come because of H. I told her she could always count on me because she is also always there when I need her. 

The visits where always odd and H always started bragging about his ""art"" and how he wants to sell it. 
He also always made me feel bad about my relationship with my gf. And tricked me into thinking that she cheats on me and was always saying that this isn't a real relationship because we haven't had sex. 

She once called me because she looked at his chats and saw he worte with his ex as G confronted H, he threw her phone at the wall and smashed it got angry and tricked her into thinking it's her fault. I lost my shit and told her to leave him and that we can meet and drink a tea so she can calm down. She took the offer a few hours passed and a I called her and asked her how she was she said all was good and H was with her on the speaker and said Hiii both acted like nothing happend. I was so disgusted by him at this point. Also after they got fired she worked shifts from 5am until 3pm 6 days a week just to pay his rent  new furniture buy his weed and what not. While he worked only 5 hour shifts twice a week. She lost her light and her eyes went empty he forced her to smoke weed and drink liqour. He also gave her drugs  sometimes without her knowing. It broke my heart. ( I wanted to tell her he's evil but then she would've only turned her back at me since her mind was so twisted by him) 

I askes her best friend and her sister what occured between them after the call they told me they haven't seen her in months and she only comes home to do laundry and when H  says that he ""makes music"" so she can't stay. 
Gs sister told me that H molested her a few months back and told her that G is ugly and he wants her instead. Gs sister told that G but she just said that she only wants to take H away from her and called her sister shallow and evil. Gs best friend also told us that G told her a few months back that H forced G to suck his dick and forced her to have sex. Another girl I knew back then also told us that he intended a threesome and started to make heavily out in front of her she left as they almost started to fuck. As I once stayed over and was sleeping on the couch he came to me pretnted to sleep and came uncomfortably close. 

H was a manipulative creepy fuck so we decided to catch him cheating and show it to G so her nightmare would end. I asked a friend to write him and jesus he catched that fish fast, he wanted to meet her the next day. That day we joked about how he will tell G that he knew from the Start that it was just trick. 

So that day came and he told her he ""makes music"" tonight so she went home and we asked her out and showed her the screenshots. She then told us she's gonna leave him. Finally we all where happy. She then told me that she only wants me to go into his apartment with her since she trusted me. As we brought her sister home ready to end it all she told us he beats her too. It  hurted so much all the time everything was so obvious but I was to stupid to realize it soon enough. 


So we went into his home and she planed to take her stuff then leave but then decided to confront him they then went out and I was 30min alone until he came in she was in treas and told me that he already knew it was fake and that he hates her now. H then told G that she is an embarrassment and that he's ashamed of her and how disgusting she and her friends are. I was lost and left it just was too much. A called her sister and told her what happened we just joked about it and it came reality. We decided that it can't end like this so her whole family showned up. We all wanted her to leave H for her well being. Then H had the audacity to tell us how rude it was to show up at his home infront of her parents who both where heart broken. Her mother told was already crying telling or either you chose him or us. 
She told her you're not my family anymore. 

Since that they she a pure hatered against us.

7,"By the time I tipped out the busser and the food runner I literally lost money. They wanted my manager to comp the meal. She wouldn‚Äôt. There was nothing wrong with it he ordered plain scrambled eggs and potatoes and that‚Äôs what he got. 

More than that, it was a party of five with two kids who made a huge mess. I almost cried as I took extra time to serve and clean after them during a very busy Sunday. The amount of disrespect I was shown by them just absolutely sunk my day. And then they wrote a bad yelp review. 

I love people and I want to so badly to continue seeing the best in them. But they paid in 2 separate bills and made sure to tell their friends to also stiff. I feel so gross. I know I should have thicker skin and brush it off but it got to me today.",27Jul2020,1
8,"I won't have a highly regarded job or become some kind of millionnaire. And what bothers me is what people will think of me
. I was the smart kid. I was the shy awkward person that would read during recess. I was the student that applies to cambridge universitu. I was the one the teachers thought would go places.
I am the sibling that was supposed to be the pride of the family

Instead, i'm dropping out of college and have no plan for my future other than working retail and seeing what happens.
And I'm happy with that. I sincerely believe that is what I want with my life. But I never knew how much other peoples expectations affected me

I am having to deal with the idea of people being disappointed, or shattering tjeir high hopes and expectations of me. I never knew all of these expectations were even on me in the first place.
It is so difficult to deal with. The guilt, the shame, the dissappointment, i feel awful.

This is my decision, my life, my future, but now I understand what people say when they talk about the weight of expectations. And I'm struggling to deal with it",27Jul2020,1

10,"I don't know. I usually have a strong sense of who I am and what my goals are and who I'd like to be, but tonight it feels like it's all crumbling apart. It started with my brain feeling foggier than usual. It got pretty bad and I started feeling a little down and frustrated about it because it's been going on for a while and I can't figure out why. I grew restless and wanted to do something. I felt like I needed to leave wherever I was. 

Then I noticed my humming. I've noticed it a lot lately. When I'm in the process of doing something, even as simple as walking, I'll make absentminded hums or grunts, even when I'm the only one around. It has started to bother me, because it only contributes to the feeling that I'm going mad. 

This, and many other deep things I know about myself, all contribute to the feeling of going insane. I'm always detached from social situations and am unable to connect with people, though I've tried. 

My reality doesn't seem real. Many things have changed recently, which should be a good thing. I've been forming good goals and have been working on self improvement, but these changes are throwing me into a new reality that makes me uncomfortable and scared, one that makes me question it's authenticity. Part of me is excited and says ""Bring it on! This is what I wanted!"", but part of me is scared, no, terrified of it, and wonders if everything as I know it is slowly fading away. 

I'm worried I'm slowly breaking. That my mind and reality as I know it is slowly shattering, and that I'm slowly losing small pieces of it. I worry that one day sooner or later I'll just lose it all and become dangerous to myself or the people around me. 

I feel weak and exposed. My strong sense of inner strength and perseverance is nowhere to be found at the moment. I've let whatever this is break me, and it's seemingly come out of nowhere.",27Jul2020,1
11,"For context, I have ADHD or something similar (my psychiatrist has never actually laid out a diagnosis or given me any real assessments, now that I think about it, but will mention ADHD and OCD tendencies, and it's well established that I have a serious anxiety and a serious depressive disorder. Come to think of it, I have no idea if that's standard practise in psychiatry or not). 

Right now I'm bored, I can't focus or find a task that I want to engage in, and I'm fighting this all-consuming urge to just lie down in my bed and sleep. I've been on two 1.5hr walks today already, can't leave the house again, and just generally don't know what to do with myself. 

I don't know where I'm going with this. There's a lot of word vomit all pent up in me right now, but no one to verbalise it to. I've been like this all day, but I also drank a lot of strong coffee a couple hours ago and it was *definitely* a mistake.",27Jul2020,1

A lot of people look down on blue collar jobs and generally view the people who do them to be uneducated losers. People need to realize that blue collar workers are essential to our society; as demonstrated in the lockdown, construction workers, utility workers, factory workers, etc were all deemed essential workers. In addition, it often takes a lot of skill and training to do those jobs; most union apprenticeships require 4000-5000 hours to reach journeyman level. People should show more appreciation for the plumbers, carpenters, equipment operators and all the other blue collar workers that build our society",27Jul2020,1
15,"Scared isn‚Äôt really the right word, I more dread it than anything else. I‚Äôve been holding onto these thoughts for a long time, and I‚Äôve never really known how to put them into words. 

I‚Äôve been staying at my aunts house in Texas for the past month and a half, and in about a week I‚Äôll need to go back home to my family in Virginia. 

For the longest time I‚Äôve struggled with depression, anxiety and other feelings of self hatred and general discomfort with my situation. I have a rocky relationship with my father at the absalute best of times and a purely negative one the rest. But this whole time I‚Äôve been in Texas, I haven‚Äôt felt bad once. I‚Äôve been happy, healthy, and productive. 

I‚Äôve cooked multiple times, worked on a summer internship, taken online languages classes, and overall gotten my life together to a point where I‚Äôm really proud of myself. The problem is, I know that will all change when I go home. As much as I love my mother, she can‚Äôt protect me. My father makes me feel awful to the point of even thinking about seeing him again made me cry for the first time in practically two months. 

My father isn‚Äôt physically abusive, but due to any unfortunate series of events he is tied pretty strongly to my thoughts of suicide and most of my issues. I still love my dad with all of my heart, and I text him at least 5 times a week. But he has many issues with himself that due to his inability to work through, have become me and my siblings issues. And I will always resent him for that.  

I just know everything will fall apart when I go home, it happens every year (though normally I am at camp). Every time I come home I spiral. And every time it gets harder and harder. It makes me want to do something rash, like hurt myself or start driving into trees, getting drunk while underaged etc. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do and I just don‚Äôt want to have to keep doing this.",27Jul2020,1

18,"Just need to vent. Someone might read this, someone might not, I'm OK either way. I'll feel better for getting it out at least. 

The reddit account I'm writing this from sort of started as a throwaway during covid, yet somehow became more popular to me than my real one  (more on that:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/hpqfle/my\_throwaway\_has\_slowly\_become\_my\_main\_account/](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/hpqfle/my_throwaway_has_slowly_become_my_main_account/)  ). People in my real life don't know this username and people here generally don't know my real name (or at least, not more than a first name). However, sometimes on rare occasions I have really enjoyed talking to someone enough that I let my guard down.

And I can honestly say, one person in particular became sort of a quarantine best friend, which I never expected. We are both in happy relationships so it was never anything like that (in fact, my girl knows about her and we've talked about all four of us maybe meeting up one day), but we had insanely similar personalities and senses of humor... and I respected her opinion when I needed to talk out something I was dealing with, and it seemed that she did the same. We never met, but she left Reddit after a while for personal reasons and we've had to dial back our conversations. I'm a believer in boundaries so for now I'm just going to keep my distance. But I discovered that sometimes I really value talking to someone who will give me perspective but is not actually involved. You know, sort of an outsider's objective opinion. And I really REALLY miss that.   


Hours after this happened, I got caught up in a fight between my divorced parents. It's really personal so I'm not going to go into it, but its the sort of thing I would have really liked an outsider's perspective from someone who GETS me in the uncanny ways this person did, but not close enough to me to have any skin in this game. I guess it's just ironic bad timing. Or maybe it isn't coincidence at all.  I know believing in a higher power isn't so popular these days, but I DO believe in G-d and I'm wondering if this is His way of telling me I need to deal with my own problems instead of looking for validation from internet strangers. Either way, interesting times ahead for sure. This is probably a boring read, so if you made it this far I feel like I should congratulate you, but like I said, I really just wanted to get it off my shoulders. Thanks for sticking around for my lamest most self-indulgent ted talk ever.",27Jul2020,1

23,"I live in a third-world country and when I was a kid, I enrolled in a local public school which didn‚Äôt have any sufficient funding from the government. There were a lot of damaged facilities and the restrooms were not very clean nor was it functional. 

One day, I really had to pee so I asked the teacher if I could go to the restroom. She said that the restroom needed repairs/ there was no running water available and since I was a boy, she told me to just pee outside. I never had the experience of peeing outside in my life until that day. I found a tree next to a building and thought that I could pee there. I unbuckled my pants and from an angle you could see my butt. 

Unbeknownst to me, there was a window above me and there were highschool students there. A guy looked at me and called out his friends. They all laughed at me and I was so embarrassed. They started pointing fingers and just generally being assholes. After I finished, I ran to my room and just flat out cried.

Because of the trauma, I now have a ‚Äúshy bladder‚Äù. Whenever I‚Äôm in public restrooms, I can‚Äôt pee when someone is around me. It also made me a little antisocial/ introverted. I can say that the experience was a really bad turning point in my life.",27Jul2020,1

I am a 21 year old male. I dropped out of high school senior year due to major depression. My household is tyrannical and narcissistic. 

I live with my dad and his mom. Both are narcissistic over controlling unbearable people to be around. 

I would work 70 hour weeks in a warehouse slinging 45 pound boxes just to not be home, not be around my family. 

I need to get out 

I broke my leg in December. 

I was getting over a relationship where I got cheated on. I got involved with this girl from work before I broke my leg. She ended up cheating on me during my leg recovery. 

This was the best thing to ever happen to me

I realized people are selfish by nature and I need to adapt. I have to stop caring what people think of me. I need to live my own life,  not my fathers. I need to take control of my life. 

I quit my job, which I had not gone back to since I broke my leg. My dad was furious, told me to get out of the house. He took it personal. He‚Äôs a ups driver and wanted me to become one too. I want to do something else.

I entered monk mode during my recovery

I got rid of all these toxic influences in my life. I cut off my mom which sounds like a big deal but it‚Äôs actually not because she didn‚Äôt have a hand in raising me haha. Got rid of parasitic loser friends, deleted Instagram and Twitter. 

I finally started to do what I wanted, I finally found myself.

I started going to the beach to just paint. I started hiking mountains. I started riding my bike 50 miles. I started jogging. I got a fish. I finally get my GED as of tomorrow morning, after avoiding this easy test due to this inner voice telling me I‚Äôm such a failure that I can‚Äôt even do that. 

I don‚Äôt know where to go next in life

I‚Äôm deeply researching potential career choices. I‚Äôm planning to join the Air Force once I get my GED. Or college, I don‚Äôt know which one I should do first. Leaning more towards Air Force. 

Before I join I want to do stuff that my family never gave me the opportunity to. My dad would never let me go on field trips. We would never go anywhere interesting, just the local mall if we actually did do anything. I was deprived of a childhood, completely neglected. 

I‚Äôm planning on going skydiving this week after I get my GED. I want to travel before I enlist. I‚Äôm planning on traveling to where one person can just vibe 

So far my ideas are Wyoming, Seattle, Mexico? I don‚Äôt know where to go. I‚Äôve been doing in depth research about solo travel. I‚Äôm very excited to say the least.

My dad probably won‚Äôt let me back home if I go on a trip and kick me out, so I have this conundrum of timing. 

I have the funds to move out and live on my own for at least a year but I‚Äôd rather avoid that as I‚Äôm on unemployment right now. I would love to move out right now, don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs just not the smart choice right now. Or so I think.

I'm in my mid twenties and my career hasn't started yet. I'm terrible with girls, I hate my appearance, I'm a ball of anxiety at times, and I care too much what people think. 

I have hope that I'll get through this phase. That it'll just take me a little longer but I'll get there. I'll be secure in myself, I'll be happy, I'll be in the career I want.

29,"Instead I feel escatic, joyful and so lucky to be able to fall in love. I don‚Äôt care that it‚Äôs delusional, irrational or impossible. I just love him. I thought that as long as I loved him I would feel pain. But love, even unrequited, unexpressed or impossible and ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù love, doesn‚Äôt have to be painful. It doesn‚Äôt have to be reciprocated to be felt and enjoyed by the lover. George MacDonald said that true joy was not in being loved but in loving. How true is that! 

I tried for the last four years every method of expelling him out of my psyche. But I couldn‚Äôt. Today I am letting go. I love him and it doesn‚Äôt matter if he doesn‚Äôt love me back. That is irrelevant. There is so much joy in loving and falling in love! I will keep my heart open to others and in due time I‚Äôm sure someone else will make me light up in the same way. 

But for now I will not try to squash these feelings. The positive ones at least. I won‚Äôt impose them on anyone else, least of all him. I won‚Äôt express my feeing to him, but I will celebrate them, on my own, in my own way,  with exuberance and gratitude!",27Jul2020,1

Living in a constant state of bored persistence

40,"Seriously. It‚Äôs reminding me of the producers of The Truman Show trying to stop him from leaving. 

Or the way limbo is portrayed in Wristcutters: A Love Story.

It started with a committed relationship I was getting into. I hadn‚Äôt been interested in someone so seriously in a few years, so this was important to me. They agreed to be monogamous and yada yada yada and then 2 weeks later they took it back. And we didn‚Äôt end up in a relationship. 

3 months later, a toxic friend/coworker I spent 6 months phasing out of my life, moved into the apartment next door. Now I‚Äôm in an endless loop of drama/avoidance/talking it out/friends again/repeat. 

Then I was offered a job at a new company pay a little more and with a lot of room for growth. Later that day, the company was put on a hiring freeze and had to take back their offer. 

That same month, a community house I was supposed to move into told me that they wouldn‚Äôt pay rent during the crisis, the day I was supposed to move in. I had to back out. All my stuff was packed. I only got to keep my apartment because the property company canceled new move ins, so my replacement couldn‚Äôt get the place. 

I‚Äôve looked pretty hard at how this could all be self sabotage. I‚Äôm guilty of not trying to find a new person/job/apartment after those all fell through. But you have to admit, I‚Äôm having a cursed year. 

Now I (late 20‚Äôs) just bought my first car and my drivers test is in 3 weeks. But my driving instructors kid has a cough. So I may not be able to fully learn everything before the test.

I was actually schizophrenic, and since I've been to the hospital -- I'm now released -- I have learned to improve my social skills, and I feel less insecure, and I allow myself to peer more into everyone's strength. I believe indeed we are all equal, because all springing from the same stardust. I know this is naive, but I like to see it like that. 

I was spouting all my bullshit over reddit, and I didn't bother to check my karma or replies, because I knew deep down that it was bullshit and I made everyone mad and angsty. Now I managed to look at the replies of my last thread -- first time I read replies since a few years of angstiness. Now I'm going to look again at the replies, and hopefully you will not be mean about it. haha. It might take a few days, but I will reply, I will try my best.

Now, today I am feeling so amazing, because I have been drinking a lot of water to experiment, and maybe I'm being slightly off the rooker again, but I do feel an increased focus, increased confidence, and so I'm feeling great and I'm making this thread. 

I'll keep it at that. Hopefully you will be kind, and I'll continue my progress.

I feel like laughter is targeted at me.

I feel WEIRD!


Truth is this is my normal now I guess. I've been like this for so long that this is me now. I need to become comfortable in my own skin.

Things were going so good but it came crashing down. I was having funny thoughts of doing harm. I decided to just spend time alone with headphones on till these feeling subsided. So much of communication is non verbal and I feel I'm interperating things in a weird way. But maybe I need to communicate how it makes me feel so I can feel less like I'm the butt of jokes.

I don't know what the hell is going on. My communication is terrible. I wish I could improve my communication skills.

Will I ever be able to just function in society. Find natural seretonin from doing things?

I guess I'm operating on a very low level. That's okay I guess. Maybe I'm a little bit stupid. 8 need to push past the uncomfortable to reach the good stuff. I fear rejection still, I can't instigate. I'm kind of dumb I guess just need to know myself better. This isn't a self pity post. What do you think?

54,"My beau and i, we have been together for 12 years (unmarried) now. We also have been in a long distance relationship for most of this time. He is also my only friend. 

To give you the background, he works with the government, and is an introvert. He is usually reluctant to see me because that would mean asking his boss for leave which i believe is difficult. He also isn't too good at texting and talking over the phone. 

I know this, yet, since i am exactly opposite and need more emotional attention, i end up fighting. My point usually revolves around the fact that we don't meet often, and it is usually me who ends up texting or calling so there is no effort from his side. 

Needless to say, the pandemic has made it worse. We haven't met since what feels like an eternity. 

I also stopped texting or calling upfront because you know, ego. But he texts me once a day. At least. That's it! 

And let me tell you this, i know he isn't cheating on me, and when he is with me, he is very engaging and i know he loves me. The problem is when he is not with me, which is most of our relationship. 

So i try to put everything aside and call him. I ask him to meet me. Its not in his nature to confirm because he believes the moment he makes up his mind, the universe makes sure that the opposite happens. So when asked if he can come meet me, he always replies by 'lets see' or 'i will try'. 

It bothers me, you know. Because i am a black and white kind of a person and i believe if you really want something, you would do anything to get it. So probably he doesn't try hard enough because he doesn't really want to meet me. 

And its not just about meeting me. Its about a lot of things which if he did upfront would make me feel loved. For example not waiting for me to ask for meeting. But he doesn't. 

And i have communicated it to him multiple times, but the same answer always - difficult job, fault in the stars, introverted nature blah blah. 

So here i am. Everyday waking up with this thing where i know i am breathing but it feels like i am out of breath because someone is pulling my lungs and trying to stuff it into this small space, and its hurting in my chest and my head, and i just can't stop wondering if i am wanted or i am out of place because nothing is going straight and i am stuck here alone. Probably this is what they call missing someone? Probably i just need to talk to someone? But wait, i have no friends so Probably i need to pay someone to talk to me, like a therapist. Probably what i am facing is anxiety. I don't know anymore what this is. I don't even know if i am making sense.

However, I'm a human and at 31 years old, my maternal instincts are making a strong point in my mind, causing me to go in awe seeing babies, small clothing, small baby shoes, toys, everything. My fiancee is also crazy about children and basically the person I've dreamt about having kids with.

The timing is perfect but the timing couldn't be worse, due to the pollution and overall craziness humans have created in the past century. Is anyone else in this situation nowadays? Wanting to have children but not sure if bringing a human being in this world would be a good idea? I honestly think to myself that not giving birth to them would actually be a proof of love, as I'm not sure about what future holds for our civilization.

68,"Since July of last year I have gone through many changes. I started a graduate program, and I ended a four year long relationship. I was cheated on after two months by the next person I started seeing. The icing on the cake though, is that I steadily gained 40 lbs in six months. I had resigned myself to the stretch marks on my thighs and love handles, but I broke down into tears when I saw them appear on my stomach. I am unhappy with the turn my life has taken and the reflection of it on my body.

In June I started using myfitnesspal and told myself it was time to lose the weight again. I know everything I need to do. I've created weight training programs, I'm using myfitnesspal, and I have told several people that I'm trying to lose weight. Unfortunately, I am still struggling. I was 200lbs when I started in June, and I am 199lbs now...

I overeat. And I keep overeating. I don't know how to stop. Even when my brain is actively telling me I'll regret it, I still continue eating. 

My questions for the community are as follows: 1) what is the best forum or subreddit for getting help and advice for this issue; 2) what triggers have helped you stick to your goals, and is there anything that can be tried to stop me from eating more (other than padlocking my fridge); 3) I know progress is going to be slow, so how can I stay disciplined, rather than getting discouraged when I only lose 1-2 lbs?

Aswell i have suffered (and i'm experiencing again) depression and axiety. So take everything I write with a grain of salt. I want to be helped, not to read sugarcoated half-thruts.

I was a curious child. So, another kid exploited this in me. I was 6 when an older kid (11) took me to a hidden corner in my appartment and put his pants down. I saw his ""No-No-parts"" and i was facinated by it. ""Why is yours bigger?"" - I asked. In response he smirked and put told me ""Let me see yours now"" And I obeyed, feeling the first sexual stimulus in my life. That kid proceeded to touch me and instructed me to touch him back. After around 15 minutes his parents called him back and I have never seen him again. Since that damned day I have started my sexual deviancy trip. I engaged in all tipes of fetishes  and have been involved in the dirty side of all fandoms out there. This hinders me so much and i can't hold myself, the only fetish I'm very gratefull I can stop myself from engaging is the..... ""loli"" stuff. Belive me when i say; the thought of ruining another child as much as I was ruined by sexual deviancy makes me sick (Btw, this paragraph alone was written in the course of months because i tend to vomit every time I acknowledge this.) The atraction is there unfortunately.  The consequences: I have a VERY loving and caring GF nowdays ( more of her later in the post) and my horrible kinks are slowly eating away at our relationship. I have ruinned my rare friendships  because of my sexual desires and I make sugestive comments to commited people.

&amp;#x200B;

When i was a kid, my parents would yell at me for doing bad stuff and tell me in the process: ""You're 16 years old"" or any other ""teen"" variations. at that time i only thought of it as a silly game to make the sermons be at least one bit fun. The way they talked to me,however, was not in a fashion that any other. It was yelling that would haunt my child brain for the whole night. ""I'll spank you"", ""I will rip your skin out of your flesh"", ""You BETTER not get anything lower than an 8"".**(S)** However; when i look back at it,it feels like they would tell me that i was  a more mature not to make me feel better, but to make them feel better to talk in such a fashion to a 6-10 yo child. I felt opressed and so began my mentality that I had to hide my childish side. That it was wrong to climb walls or trees, to sleep in my friends house, to have child crushes, feelings towards what i percieved as my propery.**(S)**

# 

Another event that comes to my mind is when I was 12. I have a sister and we were having a little brother and sister fight. My mom starts freaking out and throwing slurs into our way and my dad lashes out at my sister. He tells her how this all costs money and that he and my mom are going to die of stress if we keep fighting. But what trully marked this event was when he looked at me (a 12 yo child) and told me that if i were to fight one more time he would stop the care and hit me,  but not hit me with his belt or slaps, but with his fists. A 45 yo man told this to a 12 yo child. **(S)** I think that this was the time when I stopped trusting my parents. Both of them. It started to show that my mom was a narcisist sociopath and that my dad was deep inside insane and missguided. This was the moment when i stopped seeing them as paternal figures.**(S)**

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how it works in other countries, but where I live you need to have a little document ( which from now on i'll call ""work booklet"") that registers where you have worked, for how long you have worked etc. It looks like a book that's the size of my hand and as is as thin as a pen. I was 17 at the time (barely a year ago) and I decided that I wanted to try for some jobs ""I don't know, maybe I would love to work as an english teacher or a computer engineer."" - I told my parents naively. At this time I had decided that the best way to know what I wanted to do in life was to work ( this was some months after I had stopped wanting a carrer in the military). So, after i told them that they proceeded to tear me down, attack my emotions (I'll tell you now that when I was around 12 I self-tought how to look emotionless when people bullied me. My parents tell that it's frustrating that I look so emotionless and unreactive when they shout and scream at me. This wording stuck with me,**(S)** and only now I know why. It was a display  of cruelty and pettiness.**(S)**.) Back to the topic at hand; They stole my work booklet. They probably have thrown it away or have hidden it somewhere in the house. The point is: I can't work   
without my work booklet, and my parents know this too well.

&amp;#x200B;

My GF is aware of my psychological problems (exept the sexual stuff, because I reffuse to make her   
suffer because of my disgusting desires and polyamorous tendency. I want a monogomous relashionship, and I want to be a parent. A better parent. So what poor life decision have I made? I started talking to other people. And I speak maybe 2 lines of dialogue and I block that same person, crying for being a weak, crooked and untrustworthy Boyfriend. She gave me a chance when nobody else gave. A chance to be happy. I have a life planned with her, and I'm dragging myself away from that dream. Aswell as I am being dragged by my parents.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes, I get a courage injection from my mind. I stand up tall and say to myself: ""I WILL change."" So I start do workout, to do nofap (to contain my sexual desires), to study, to do all this stuff and... give up. When I wake up early to make some morning tea and eggs I look back and I see one of my parents watching me. I ask ""what is up?"" and they make some snarky comment that tears my willpower down.

When I started to workout they have thrown my running shoes away. They took my keys away, they   
prohibited me from going out, they started complaining about the early morning noises (even though they themselves are very noisy in the late night hours). I feel so dragged down that even when my   
parents are away I simply lie down and do nothing, as if i am recovering from the deep wound inflicted throughout the years. The result is that when I finnaly get peace I'm unable to do a single productive thing.

&amp;#x200B;

My latest mistake was when my parents came back from a short travel. I have a glandulary problem that makes me sweat a lot. So what's the first thing they told me when they come back to a house that I have cleaned? Well, if you guessed a ""Thank you"" you're wrong. They told me ""You stink, and you didn't have any showers for three days. Go take a shower."" I was angry (note; I had took a shower 2 hours earlier). So i slowly walked to my dad and told him; ""I'm gonna gently ask you for some respect. I'm 18 years old and you talked to me like I'm 12, do you understand where you went wrong?""The result: He was mad. He said  "" WTF? ARE YOU INSANE? TALKING TO YOUR DAD LIKE THAT? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?"" He went to my room and ripped my PC from the outlet in the wall, luckly not damaging anything. ""You'll not use this fucking thing until next week."" And so I waited. I waited a week. And the first thing I did was to open a Notepad and write this fucking big ass pointless box of text. 

&amp;#x200B;

72,"After being turned down for a waiting on job close to home (background casual dining chain, personal experience of 16 years of waiting on  mostly in the busiest retail park outside of London and 14  years with bar work, the jobs intertwine in the industry), before i go on this is a part rant, part epiphany and although I seem extremely negative,

 I loved my proffesion, absolutley loved it, nobody does it for that long without deciding to, but recently its gotten worse and more saturated with overpaid newbies that can operate Excel but not the pass, or the waiting on or the barwork or the kitchen, think they do well on the host, they dont people talk to managers differently than regular staff so they tend to get less shit from waiting guests.

Quarantine has helped me realise that whilst being in the restaurant trade, I've never had a chance to go any further than the very bottom of the rung, and i respect that people start somewhere but consistent results, hard work and vast experience and smashing record amounts of money consistently for the company doesn't mean fuck all anymore, having staffs ideas presented as their own, viewing knowledge as if its a threat to know more, or  the people who just do not give a flying fuck about anything and sitback until payday, put you under extreme pressure to earn them and the area manager their bonuses and only promote people who are terrible at the job but keep the management's assholes clean, or even worse the mixture of the two, the Industry is saturated with bad apples.

Time to get paid a decent wage with set shifts, sick pay, paid holidays and weekends back to myself, fuck the random Monday and Thursdays off, missing nearly every social engagement ever, not knowing my rota until the week my shifts start, oh and the insane stress you have to endure for 14 hours on a Saturday with no breaks, and a person who cant wait on adding to the stress by hassling someone who is trying to keep track of a huge section because the management has decided one person can serve and look after, to standards over 60 people on 14 different tables, because they dont get you are permanently organising your tasks into priority order and thinking how to complete them, whilst simultaneously taking food orders and drink orders rembering who has a bill/just seated/wanting to order/wanting to pay all whilst King Queen no clue is earning 40k a year to constantly shout you when food needs to go when you're stopped either entering an order or with a customer taking an order. All the while maintaining a serial killer like grin because god forbid you cant look deep in thought, minimum wage workers are incapable of thought apparently.

If you do any of the above and own a restaurant, learn the job on the hardest of days and you wont find yourself being snapped at by staff or them just leaving because its more stress than most can handle on a good day, it will develop an understanding and abilty to spot when someones section is going under. A 6 table section is the maximum a fine dining restaurant will give its staff to ensure excellent service. Reducing that stress of the job staff will barely leave.

Anyways i figured a warehouse and the logistics would be very much like a restaurant this goes here, that goes there, dont drop it and make sure the customers happy, and hopefully the manger doesn't flap through lack of on the job experience and take it out on the staff on busy shifts. Practical exam is in about a week, im a bit daunted by the task ahead, but it surely has to be better than the restaurant game is now",27Jul2020,1

Sue asked me ‚Äòhow old are you?‚Äô (I was nothing to do with the convo up until this point) and I said ‚Äò29‚Äô then she reacted ‚Äòawwwww are yer?‚Äô 

- [ ] Then sue asked me ‚Äò when‚Äôs your birthday?‚Äô I said ‚Äò30th November‚Äô then Sam out loud said ‚Äòmines 21st‚Äô in a bubbly up herself kinda way. Then sue  (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‚Äòoh close birthdays eh, are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?‚Äô Jokingly as i said and then said sam whilst tagging clothes was like  ‚Äòooooo no, ooo no ooooo no, ooo no I don‚Äôt think my fella would like that, don‚Äôt think my fella would like that‚Äô   and looked annoyed a bit too but really arrogant too as she was tagging a shirt. Then it just went quiet. 


-she‚Äôs always been really pleasant with me and friendly in a normal person way but  I feel she got annoyed by the joke because I‚Äôm ugly and yet she stinks very very  bad of BO (the staff talk about it behind her back) and looks like a complete junkie. She wears the same grey tracksuit that‚Äôs delinquents wear everyday that she got locked up in.


- [ ] I didn‚Äôt say anything was I ripped and basically called ugly here? Her bf is in prison whilst she‚Äôs in on community service and he does call A her often in the shop but she also checks out other dudes sometimes. And fancied another guy in the shop ( so sue said) and he ripped her to bits to me about how much she smells.

Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‚Äòhow‚Äôs your job search going‚Äô quietly and moodily. but when I Didn‚Äôt look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody/mad about it so idk what to as then it was probably annoying too. One point I nodded in agreement at something she said in a moody way and she said ‚Äòcould look more enthusiastic about it like‚Äô in an annoyed way. Then ever since I did that:

She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‚Äòwell done‚Äô and ‚Äòvery well done‚Äô a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I‚Äôm thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‚Äòawwwww ok......and well done‚Äô as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‚Äòlet me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc‚Äô often on email replies when I told her I got a job.

80,"Sorry if I come off douchey or arrogant, that‚Äôs not my intention here. 

For context, the university I‚Äôm going to be a sophomore at is known for two things: finance and the performing arts. Not to generalize, but more often than not the people in each group are very different from one another: the former are usually moderates/conservatives, the latter are usually leftist. The former are all about money, the latter are going into ‚Äòlol money‚Äô careers. The former is about math and cold hard facts while the latter is about feelings and expression. You get the idea.

I‚Äôm a finance student, and a somewhat typical one at that: I‚Äôm politically moderate, I wear suits to class, I consider myself a logical rather than emotional person. I am double majoring in philosophy and don‚Äôt really want to be an investment banker, if that counts for anything. 

Now, my type in girls aligns more with the latter: I‚Äôm basically attracted exclusively to artsy girls, the type that thrift clothes and have jpg insta accounts. There are plenty of those kind of girls around campus. 

Problem? Generally, they hate me. Whenever I‚Äôve tried to date them, it ends in disaster. Take general contempt for finance majors (yes, that‚Äôs a thing),  add disagreements about politics, values, and goals, and you get a perfect recipe for catastrophe.

 I've questioned my gender many times, and each time I came to the conclusion that I was a woman and I could be happy with that. It wasn't that bad, and the only reason I was unhappy in my own skin was due to unprocessed trauma and internalised sexism.

I'm in my early 20s now and it's getting hard to keep resorting to that answer. Every dream I have where I'm a man are some of the best I ever have. I wake up and I feel a dissonance in my head. My mind and body don't feel quite right. It didn't make sense like it made sense in my dream.

110,"We are moving next month and doing all of the things to prep this monster of a house we bought. 4 rooms for 2 people. Supposed to have roommates, had roommates, no longer have roommates.

Pool.

Pool is maintained by me. I hired a pool company for $150 a month and they couldn't maintain. Can't even put a finger on issue. Algae grows in days. Texas heat is too much. Losing easily inch of water over night and water bill was $400 this month. Called water company. They said bill will be double the way things are going.

I started Prozac. I can't do it anymore. The utter crippling squeezing requirements to sell this home are debting not only my pockets (unemployed) and my husband's (over budget) and I cannot do it anymore. I have looked into life insurance for myself but you have to wait 2 years to kill yourself for a payout and if they find out you were suicidal, they won't pay. I just want this chapter closed. I don't have any more $400 water bills left in me. I just pray this house sells so we aren't paying $1500 a month on top of rent. Not much we can do being in the military either so we have to move.",27Jul2020,1
111,"So basically I'm an artist at 19. I did terrible in highschool so I just kinda want to draw and I've been making money from it.
But my parents see it as some kind of child's dream despite me getting to pay for my new glasses, a new phone and paid off my tution for private lessons they made me take. Basically I never worked a ""real"" job before. I'm a kind of ""stick it to the man"" sorta guy. My parents keep saying ""well you can work and draw too"" when i bring up that i want to do art. 
I can't tell them that I don't want to finish getting my subjects to get a ""real"" job.
I think they're afraid it's not important enough because i'm not wearing a suit and I just stay at home. I try to tell them I just want that to be my focus and I could pay social security that way but they don't listen to me and force me to go to private lessons.
I never really told them ""no"" because I wanted the job experience but it doesn't matter to me now that I'm older. So i've given up. I went to do the exam today and currently waiting on the results. If I fail...AGAIN (I don't study) what do I tell them?",27Jul2020,1
112,"It's the last week of Parks and Recreation Month this month of July. Parks and Recreation Month recognizes the efforts of park staff in maintaining our public parks, and in addition, it encourages the public to go out and enjoy park spaces. With the pandemic, the public is asked to maintain social distancing and safety measures to keep parks as a safe environment. Men with BPH (a common prostate enlargement condition associated with symptoms like frequent urination and slow urinary flow) can also benefit from visits to the park by taking a walk or jog as well as clearing your mind in the calm, green environment.¬†

As July comes to a close, what are men with BPH doing to enjoy the last week? Do you even know what BPH is? Some may know BPH first hand without knowing that it's called as such. Getting up many times to go to the bathroom, especially at night? Notice that your stream is slower or weaker than normal, that it's hard to start or stop urination? Have you talked to your doctor?¬†

Men's health and awareness need more attention from male patients as well as the public. Read and share our blog and other social media to support spreading the message!¬†[https://linktr.ee/sunjourhc](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8623979177304050517/5203531207437293786#)  


If you're looking for a natural solution to mild BPH symptoms, consider UMOOZE, a plant therapy containing astragalus and soybean extracts, which was shown in a clinical study to help BPH patients reduce unpleasant symptoms associated with BPH and improve quality of life ([https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02313233](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8623979177304050517/5203531207437293786#))¬†

115,"Really thankful for my father in law. 

My dog escaped from his fenced in backyard and I had a breakdown. My old dog is my best friend and I was worried I'd never see him again. He's basically my support dog. I was weeping, ran around the house, asked the neighbors, and was in hysterics. 

He ended up coming back into the yard, 10 minutes later, happy as can be. I screamed and held him tightly. It was one of the best moments of my life, seeing him run to me. 

I realized after the fact that my father in law's security cameras must have picked up on everything.. So I was really anxious and embarrassed. I sent him a text telling him what happened but he didn't reply. He's not a big texter, and I don't know him that well, so I was worried. 

But my husband saw him yesterday and he told him that he wouldn't watch the video and that he'll repair the fence this week. He said that he would be crying too if his dogs got out. Really made me feel better.

Do you know about penpals?Have you heard about them?
In the letters era,people used to give advertisement in newspapers, magazines as finding penpals..people write letters to the people finding interesting,and a friendship bonds via letters only..after phones and emails,the penpal culture became very thin..

I've heard about penpals from my mother when I was child..on that time it fascinated me that people who never met ach other,just became friend by writing letters!!!Ummm interesting right!!

But after sometime,I forgot about that..it was going smoothly..but in this Covid situation, I'm stuck at home..and one day I remembered the penpals thing my mother told me a long ago!!

So I searched, searched and searched in google and YouTube about penpals..there I found a website where you can make a profile,put things you like in your profile texts and search people who are like you finding penpals.. it's interesting..
So I made a profile of mine there in March..I met a lot of people,a lot means a lot..but ultimately I connected only with few..now we regularly talk in emails..

You know,you don't know someone,but you're starting to know someone only by talking..and I can also send them letters..so it's really interesting..
And who knows someday I get a chance to meet them in real!!

I used to see a lot of YouTube vido about meeting penpals in real life..and trust me the videos are so thoughtful!!!
So what do you think?

If you like I can attach the link of the penpal site!!
Take care everyone!!

120,"Male) aged 30) 6ft tall) 160-163lbs) I‚Äôm naturally an ectomorph (tall and slim) (but now I have skinny fat vibes) 

6 months ago my face got fat and round af  (larger head size) and made me look skinnier as it was then out of proportion to my skinny fat  body (I have a severe pot belly too) but it went larger too. as I gained weight from 11.1 stone to 11.10 stone. Recently I went down to 11.5 again and jogged  and it made a little difference definitely but not anywhere as small as I want and I still have the pot belly and larger sized  head . It‚Äôs difficult to get below 11.4 stone event with fasting tbh so that‚Äôs the threshold. 

See Iv been jogging most nights in my garden and fasting as I said Iv lost around 5lbs give or take and I‚Äôd say only face is about 5% slimmer. I want it smaller like it was before last December. Last year in 2019 April it was larger then than it is now and I lost it in a few weeks of fasting no problem at all. This time Iv been at the jogging and fasting for 3 weeks and very little difference. I fast often  then eat late on evening is that better? I try eating between 6-8pm and that‚Äôs it. 

I drank a lot of water yesterday will that help?  

‚óæÔ∏èI‚Äôm down to 11.2 now  and my face looks larger than ever and I was a lot thinner faced  when I was last that weight in 2018

122,"It happened gradually. Me and my friend were basically inseparable and we'd been friends for about 3 years.  We gamed all the time and did lots of shit together, and had the best of moments. Year 11 came in and we were studying for our IGCSE's. We'd always study and we practically had our best times till I fell in love with this girl around November 2019.

I started drifting off my friendship with him, I started making more time for her and she was only a crush. I skipped gaming on minecraft gaming nights with my other friends trying to text a girl that didn't end up with me. I typically gave my crush canteen money sometimes. And when I didn't have anymore money, I'd borrow my friend money so I could buy myself something. But I'd always payback. This girl really drained my energy. I got rejected and pissed for a whole 2 days. I even threatened to beat up him and another friend of mine over some dumb debt. But really it was fueled by my hatred from rejection.  I remember saying pretty awful things to him. And really did awful things to him.

Soon enough we went from being the best of friends to my personal bank... He gave me money and I'd pay him back. Fast forward 3 months, I realized my self worth and stopped trying to chase my crush but it was too late for that. My mom basically had school fees issues and I got kicked out of school. But we paid off 2 weeks later, so I got back to school thinking I could come back and fix everything but the pandemic shut down our schools.

Contacting him was harder because I could understand if he wanted to avoid me because of how toxic I became... not only that, he was really busy with his own stuff. And I'm flying out of the country soon and permanently.

Bro, If you're seeing this. I'm really sorry that I let my ego go off like that. I'm sorry that I became really toxic over a girl that had no meaning. I really wish I could take that shit back. I know we're now headed separate ways and we may not talk to each other since you've decided to ghost me. But I really want to thank you for being my friend man, even when I acted in my idiotic ways  you really showed me not to and i'm grateful for that dude. Thank you for sharing the fun times with me. It was never an easy 3 years. Wherever you are I wish the best for you in life. Peace man. ‚úå",27Jul2020,1
124,"  Im a 21 year old guy who‚Äôs normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‚Äòawwww‚Äô (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‚Äòhow‚Äôs your job search going‚Äô quietly and moodily. but when I Didn‚Äôt look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody/mad about it so idk what to as then it was probably annoying too. One point I nodded in agreement at something she said in a moody way and she said ‚Äòcould look more enthusiastic about it like‚Äô in an annoyed way. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‚Äòohhhh....how did you apply for there then?‚Äô When Just before she‚Äôd give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‚Äòyou looking at her there?‚Äô in a smiley way, I didn‚Äôt Say anything. and  also said ‚Äòwe normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I‚Äôll just keep you with me‚Äô pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she‚Äôs referring me back to herself again and I didn‚Äôt want to but I said ‚Äòok thank you‚Äô and she just replied with ‚Äòsee you next week‚Äô.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I‚Äôm ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‚Äòwell done‚Äô and ‚Äòvery well done‚Äô a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I‚Äôm thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‚Äòawwwww ok......and well done‚Äô as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‚Äòlet me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc‚Äô often on email replies when I told her I got a job.


Edit: she started saying the ‚Äòawwwww‚Äô a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it too",27Jul2020,1
