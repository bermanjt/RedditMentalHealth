0,"I’m a young guy and  went to my job  adviser of one month she had chose me forward for a job interview.  and she asked me do I need interview clothes ( polite/bubbly  tone of voice) i said ‘no thanks iv got all that’ and her response was ""oh, have you got all that? (Bubbly Tone of voice as I said) and then she said ‘ ok well do you know how to conduct yourself on an interview"" while looking at me pleasantly with furrows eyebrows  , (see I’m very shy and  quiet) I said ‘yes’ she went on to say (she used her hands as gestures in motion to what she was saying)  ""ok, well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes....make sure you get a shave. make sure you cut your nails. make sure you do you're hair up all nice and that"" (in a voice between a mix of bubbly and assertive) then she paused a bit looking at her computer and then said ""and make sure you put some aftershave on as well, for the girls make sure it's men's"" then she burst out laughing. I just smiled with it. She said it nicely judging by a laugh at the end but idk. i wasn't near clean shaven at the time of the appointment tbh) but always was previous appointments. she sent me an email the next day about it saying about what I need to take with me to the interview and at the bottom it had underlined ‘please dress smartly’ and ‘good luck’ 

Edit- the next interview she chose me for I had the next week she never said anything like this at all again and she filled out the application form for me for it and I didn’t ask",19Jun2020,1
2,"I’m 12 5’9 59kg. I’m around the right weight fir my height but for some reason alot of fat is concentrated around my stomach and it was never like this before. I started gaining fat around my stomach when I was around 10 for some reason. My weight is fine but I don’t have good fat distribution and since the rest of my body is quite skinny. Is this a part of puberty and will it go away? Is this my fault? Is this normal? What can I do to change my situation 


Any help would be greatly appreciated.",19Jun2020,1

5,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody/mad about it so idk what to as then it was probably annoying too. One point I nodded in agreement at something she said in a moody way and she said ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ in an annoyed way. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it too",19Jun2020,1

8,"First off, I'm not a fan of hip-hop or rap, so I don't know that much about Wayne or other people in the industry, but I have noticed that most ""Celebrities of Color"" seem quick to support the BLM idea that institutionalized racism is still a serious problem in America and that ""white people,"" have an obligation to make sacrifices to attone for their inherited privilege.

But not Wayne. And he's not afriad to say so. Mind you, I think he knows he's putting his balls on the chopping block, but he seems to have too much integrity to just nod and recite SJW slogans to appease the Black Crusaders. Why? Because his personal experience contradicts the narrative.

Wayne's life was *saved* by a white cop. And the majority of his fandom is white. Imagine that. White people rescuing and adoring a black man. White people coming together en masse to appreciate and financially support a black person, while he watches other black people trash talk and shoot each other... YMMV vary, but Li'l Wayne has stayed true to his point of view in a time when public opinion has become extremely polarized and that takes guts.",19Jun2020,1
9,"work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked away to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as s was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

11,"My whole life has been a weird chaos of depression and anxiety. Sometimes, I didn’t know that’s what was going on, but when I look back, I can see instances of it through my whole life. I have a hard time opening up about a lot of it because I feel like my experience wasn’t that bad and that it can’t possibly be having as big of an impact on me as I think. Basically, I don’t wanna be sitting here going “I’m a victim, pitty me!” when I don’t deserve it. 

However, I finally opened up a bit more about my childhood to my SO. She and I have been together for about a year and a half now, and it’s the most I’ve really shared with her about it. Her childhood is her business, but I will say it was definitely hard. 

I just want to share some very key moments that happened in my life and get feedback. I’m not sure why, but I think if people unanimously do/don’t relate to me, I may be able to have a far clearer mind and really realize what’s going on.

1.) my parents are very religious (Church of Christ) and wanted my sister and I to be an extension of their beliefs instead of individual people with different opinions and beliefs. When I graduated HS and moved out, I was informed that if I stopped going to church, they wouldn’t help me with anything anymore, as they could not condone that behavior. Hell and God were huge fear tactics in our house.

2.) they used spankings to “get desired outcomes.” If my older sis or I did something wrong, they never talked to us about it, ever. They yelled at us and punished us. I remember being backhanded only once or twice (the extent of physical abuse) and same for my sister. As punishment for arguing and crying while in the car, they would role the windows down on that kids side and yell at them to keep on crying for the world to hear (this would happen in large towns)

3.) when my mom saw I had cut myself, I didn’t want to tell her the truth because I never felt like I could go to her with personal stuff. I told her it was caused by fencing at school. She said “next time, it better be” and walked away.

4.) lots of hollow promises. Like it was evident for a while they my parents valued my sister more. They would always make time to go see her when she first left for college and even once I did too. They would pay for vocations and certificates so she could ensure jobs she wanted while in school. They promised me those things and then never came through, typically opting to help my sister instead. 

5.) never really had key conversations with me. I knew I would get a period one day, but not exactly what it would entail. No prior advice on products was given to me, and I was not warned about cramps or anything. When I asked my mom to show me how the products work, she told me to “read the booklet” in the box and walked away from me.

6.) when I tried to come out as gay to my mom, I figured it would be easier to say I was bisexual first (idk, I was like 17 and scared). I told her and she said “it’s just a phase” and, again, walked away.

7.) my mom once used the line “so this is why you have no friends” during an argument we were having. I was like 19 at the time and had recently moved to a new city to go to a college I liked better. 

8.) I know most of this seems about my mom. That’s because it is. My dad and I have next to no relationship. I can’t remember him ever really trying to get to know me. When I come home (I’m 29 now) he still ribs on me for movies I’m watching or interests I have but doesn’t really talk to me. He doesn’t do it I. A mean way, as he has always been kinda quiet. However, he also never tries to initiate conversation with me and goes directly to my mom. Mom has gotten a LOT better these days. She has accepted that I’m gay and apologized for some of her past behaviors. But my dad still goes directly to her instead of ever initiating conversation with me. It makes me question why he ever wanted to be a parent.

That’s just to name some of the things that are more key to my present life, but there were countless nights of screaming and anger that I remember 

Like I said, my mom has apologized for some stuff. Namely that she was an alcoholic in my childhood. However, my depression and anxiety have been eating me alive lately and I’m wondering if it’s because of my upbringing. I have a very difficult time admitting to myself that it was abusive. My SO says it was but my brain, for some reason, won’t accept that I personally am or have been abused unless it was physical. I can accept it for other people, just not myself.

I have BPD, OCD, GAD, and depression, but there are later in life events that may have caused some of that?

How to kill myself quick? Doesn’t have to be painless. Before you give any shit advice on how life so precious and I should kill myself please be noted that:  I have been wrongly accused of pedophelia and I’m only 25 I was posted on Facebook for talking to a vigilante underage.   I was on a website that I knew was full of fakes with 2 friends and we thought we were talking to a creepy older guy pretending to be an undeager but it turned out to be a pedo hunter vigilante.  My only crime is fuckin stupidity I am in no way shape or form a pedo.  And yes I could prove that in court or do my best to but that makes no difference because I’ve lost my job house and everything that I had because of a fucking false accusation but what’s worse it’s all over social media so even if proven not guilty to the public eye I’m a pedo no matter what.

21,"My income has not decreased because of the pandemic, as disability benefits have not been affected.  At the same time I've had trouble meeting expenses.  There had always been temptation to take advantage of income replacement benefits for people who have lost their jobs.  The amount is three times as much each month as my disability benefits, with no auditing or application refusals planned until after the pandemic is over.  I resisted being dishonest because I wanted to be fair to working people who actually had lost income, and I didn't want to burden our government when it's already going deep into debt providing people with support they need during the shutdown.

Then I found myself running out of cigarettes and money while I was home alone.  After several hours I broke down and stole a pack of cigarettes from my brother's carton in his bedroom.  After I had done that, I thought to myself, ""Well, I'm a criminal now.  I threw away the only thing I had left, which was behaving with honesty and integrity.  Why should I pretend to be better than other criminals when I'm not.""  So I applied for the income replacement benefit online and it was automatically approved, with a cheque to be delivered to my mailbox within 10 business days.

When my brother got home I immediately informed him of the theft from his room and asked him to keep his bedroom door locked.  He refused and said: ""Just don't go into my bedroom when I'm not home, okay???""  I also informed him that I'd filed the fraudulent income replacement application.  He made no comment on that, and nothing further has been said.

The cheque arrived in the mail yesterday, and I cashed it immediately.  In the meantime I had borrowed $40 cash by asking openly for them, and immediately repaid those funds once I'd cashed the cheque.  Since the income replacement benefits are a separate application for each month's tranche, I don't intend to apply for any more of them.  I don't need the money.  This was never about greed.  It was about poverty and having sunk so low that I was stealing from my brother's room because I'm always broke.

The government website where I applied for that one month of income replacement has a generally worded notation saying: ""Have you received funds you are not entitled to?  You can repay them.""  Below that is a button that says Repay Now.  For at least the end-of-June to end-of-July disability benefits pay period, I shan't need to spend any money from my disability benefits.  I'll find a way to send that money as partial reimbursement for the income replacement benefits I've stolen.

None of this is making any excuses.  I stole money from our government when it's already cash-strapped.  But for the first time in years I feel like a human being instead of like dogshit on the shoe of working people.  That's how poverty makes anyone feel.  I'll pay whatever penalty I have to pay for stealing, but I'm not going to slut my ass by pretending to have remorse.  Briefly feeling human from having a human amount of money in my hands for the first time in more than a decade is worth later going to prison for.",19Jun2020,1

I hope my story helps you in anyway. Please hang in there.

If this helps you, please share these videos with the ones you know who are going through their worst times so that they don't do something to themselves that they might regret doing.

23,"i broke up with my boyfriend a couple weeks ago and it felt like the worst decision of my life because it was in the spur of the moment because i was mad about something and i didn’t realize how much of a bullet i actually dodged. i’ve learned more about myself in the past couple weeks than i have in the year and a half that i was with him because when it came to him i never paid attention to myself anymore. i let go of small passions and interests and let myself go when it came to my creativity. i’m realizing it now that i never felt like myself with him and i think that’s why it was so hard to communicate and share myself with him. i didn’t know who i was anymore when i was with him. i constantly felt judged and minimized when it came to talking about my interests. if it didn’t benefit him of interest him he didn’t care. everything always had to be so serious with him. i didn’t know how to have fun anymore. we were like an old married couple and i’m only 19. he was honestly kind of mean and really judgmental. not just to me but others too. he constantly attacked me for using my twitter so much and being able to be myself and open when it came to others but not him but i realize now it’s because other people actually have a shit about me and had an interest in whatever it was i had to say. i never felt like i could be myself and tell him things without the fear of feeling judged or him mansplaining me. it’s really sad that i’m just now figuring this all out but i’m glad i finally did. we were never on the same wavelength and he never saw me for my full potential, only in the parts i was lacking. my point of this post was to say i realized what i wanna do in college and realized how much creativity i have built up. i’m gonna pursue my dream of becoming a content creator who blogs and vlogs. and i’m gonna finally study what i want. i romanticized becoming a doctor with him and i killed my gpa over taking classes i don’t excel in just to show him i do things for him and that i could be smart for him. i didn’t need to prove that. i needed to prove that i’m my own person. i never felt supported when i was failing classes or when he made me the shittiest fucking schedule taking multiple science classes in one semester. i feel like he was setting me up to fail and he succeeded at that. so a big fuck you for that. i’m a creative person and that’s how i see myself being successful in life. not constantly in your shadow while you wish you had someone “smarter” to date. you denied that everytime i said it and it made me feel guilty but i had a reason for thinking it and i wasn’t wrong. you know it was true. anyways. i am smart. i am passionate. i am creative. i am beautiful. i am young. and i am worthy.",19Jun2020,1

27,"sup. I am a (23 F) and I spent my whole life listening to other people about who I should be and what I should do. Like many highschoolers, I wanted so badly to be included and prove myself and prove I was enough that I spent forever envisioning a future me. This future me had put in all the work. She was smart, independent, fit, adventurous, articulate whatever. While what I'm about to say below could sound like a pat on the back its actually the fucking cornerstone of why I am so god damn confused about life and what I'm supposed to do here and what even really matters.

 I imagined that this future me would be absolutely wonderful, overflowing from the brim with magic and vibrant intoxicating passion for the world and the pursuits she was capable of.

I wanted to do every step right and nail each part and assert my value, competence, capability, independence, self belief, grit, passion whatever.

Then I got here. I have it. I literally have everything I could want. And I feel like shit. All the time.

I tell you the beginning of this paragraph to set the stage for the end of the paragraph. I make 6 figures in an engineering job at a top tech company, I have wonderful friends and family and a beautiful place to live. I am in a deeply caring relationship with an attractive, funny man. I am healthy and safe and accomplished and proud of all I've achieved. I feel good about the way that I look and I have a positive relationship with myself. WHY ISNT THIS WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE? WHY DON'T I FEEL PASSIONATE AND FREE AND EXCITING AND THRILLED AT A WORLD OF OPPORTUNITY FOR EXCITEMENT AT MY FINGERTIPS? If this isn't it then what the FUCK am I supposed to do????????

I started my job 9 months ago and I felt the deadness, the emptiness, but I thought I'm adjusting to having moved from east to the west coast so I'll set a random fucking goal and go for it and bury my pain and constant suffering by drinking a lot of coffee and throwing myself into work and being a fucking avatar going through the motions like an actor in my own life. I checked all the boxes. I decided I'd try to get a promotion and guess what? I fucking did it.

So I'm left with this. There is no where to go. There is incredible future me to escape to anymore because now that I'm on the other side it feels dead and empty and shitty and boring. The only thing that ever matters is right now. Why do I do anything? I'm not convinced there is any person I can be, acheivement I can have, way I can look that will be ""it"". There is nothing else to ever do, be, or get. You can do be or get fucking anything and those people still feel like this anyway??

So I'm lost. I've always been a dreamer and hard worker and now, on the otherside of what I worked so hard for, I feel terrible. All the time. I have no idea what to do. I can't convince myself that theres anything that is worth working for. So I'm a zombie ass shell of a fucking human acting in my own life going through the motions as a high functioning piece of shit inside hoping that theres something to figure out that I'm missing.",19Jun2020,1

Went on a bit of a bender recently (coke Xanax oxy alcohol), don't worry I use drugs responsibly and don't mix uppers and downers.

Today I woke up and went to work and just had depressing thoughts all day long for no reason.

I come from a wealthy family and had a good upbringing, although I am now financially independent.

I feel like this is the American paradox: we have so much yet we're not satisfied.

I also feel like I'm incapable of ever being in a successful relationship again in my life (straight male). Its like that Kanye song- ""i always find, yeah I always find something wrong"".

Snail mail might be going out of style, but I like to incorporate things into my life that remind me of when life was a bit.. simpler. It’s also a good opportunity to brush up on my cursive and find a faraway friend in the process. First and foremost, I’m curious to hear what your life has been like during this time. I’d preferably like a pen pal that’s not from my country since I’m curious to learn about a different culture and a different human experience during what may possibly be the end of the world as we know it.

People have this weird idea that we shouldn’t judge historical figure for their horrible beliefs...? I usually see people saying: oh yeah Jefferson had enslaved folks but it was of his time, he didn’t know any better, you can’t judge him for it. 

But I think what people forget is... 1. celebrities and public figures are notoriously out of touch with the general public. 2. There has always been dissent towards actions/beliefs that are violent towards others. 

It’s easier to teach kids (and aligns with the patriotic agenda of the gov) that [insert founding father] is absolved of their enslavement/other violence against humanity because of the legality/thought of the time than it is to teach nuance and admit that this country has bore witness to some horrible ass shit. Rebellions against the rich, powerful, and violent have ALWAYS and COMMONLY existed. It’s just that we learn a government approved history from the side of the powerful so y’all never got taught it in school and didn’t look for more. 

As long as slavery and racism has existed, so has opposition to slavery and racism; both from enslaved people, PoC and even white people. As long as women have been controlled by men personally and politically there has been opposition to it. There has always been resistance from lgbtq folks and their allies. 

Oppression is ALWAYS met with resistance from the oppressed peoples and their allies. It’s not like no one thought up that slavery was bad. Come on...

Think about how much racism public figures are spouting out today... but I would never want my grandkids or someone learning history in the future to say... oh it was ok to be racist before the civil uprisings of 2020, because everyone was!",19Jun2020,1

I can’t go on Twitter because all I see are people saying that white people and cops are the scourge of America. Soon, I will be both of those things. All I want to do is make a positive impact on this country. It seems though that depending on how our government handles this situation, the ability to have that impact as a cop may be diminished. Fuck the media. Fuck the ones trying to divide us. We all agree what that cop did in Minneapolis was horrible. If we all agree on that, why are we so divided over it?

I wasn't doing that well in classes, I had almost no friends (and truthfully, didn't like the ones I did have that much), had no romantic prospects, and just didn't have a life. After coming home, I ""met"" a girl on Tinder that went to my high school, and while we had very long and intense conversations I'm also receiving hella mixed signals, we may never be able to meet, and not hearing from her in a while (she's on vacation) has honestly made me really down. I've been irritable and sad for months now probably.

During lockdown I was talking on and off with a high school friend I hadn't seen in a few months, and when he stopped by in town we decided to meet up. I'd been incredibly down for months, and was kinda anxious about meeting a friend in that state. I was worried enough that I very nearly cancelled. But I went through with it and actually had a great time. We just bought some coffee and dinner and walked around a bit and chatted. It felt great to interact again with another human (family and cashiers aside) in person, especially a friend I know well. It's the first time I've felt happy in a while, since I last had a long conversation with that woman. Now I'm thinking about reaching out to some other high school friends that may be in the area, but I already feel the loneliness creeping back.",19Jun2020,1

I guess that's something i can be proud of, at least. 

I feel I've more to feel bad about though. I feel i am just... maybe not that great of a person. Maybe I'm not kind enough, or happy enough, or optimistic enough, to be a good person that people, when they think of that person they think,  ""that's a good person""

Maybe I'm just this way and that's all I'll ever be, no matter how much i try to change. No matter how hard i try to be better, to be good, worthy.

I don't really want to talk about what happened or what I'm feeling. I don't want to go through it again and I don't want to remember. I've been avoiding it and I don't see anything wrong with it now, like is it really bad to avoid grief?

It is fascinating and terrifying at the same time. I want to learn more about the universe but I fear the more I learn I'll go into a existential crisis. How do you guys remain curious without getting scared of space?

I just graduated high school today. They gave me my diploma in my school parking. I didn’t want to go - I didn’t see much merit in the stunt, but I did need my diploma. I graduated top of my class and in September I head off to an elite university on a full ride. Everyone says I ought to feel happy and proud of my accomplishments. This is the height of youth - a past I will one day long for. Yet, I cannot help but feel that I am a complete failure as a person.
I was pretty well-known in school, but I never had any close friends. I was a third wheel until junior year when they finally abandoned me. The entirety of senior year, despite being one if the most recognized and well liked kids, I was completely alone. I did have clubs, they were something to get excited about, but most things bored me most of the time. 
I used to be very religious. I would pray every night, asking Jesus to either please make me feel loved or to at least take me home. But gradually, first through coming out and then through further self-analysis, I became disillusioned with the Church and God. God should’ve done better with this world and yet I’m to believe that he is perfect. That makes me angry without consolation.
I was miserable most of the time. I cried often but I never told anybody and I acted as if nothing was wrong. I got all my work done, so I guess there was never any need to worry from an outside perspective.
Every morning, after the bus would drop me off at school, I would drop my bag off in the library and sit on one of the benches in front of the basketball court, it had a complete view of the sky. Every morning I would watch the sun rise and it was beautiful. As long as I had at least the sun to look forward to, I had a reason to get up in the morning. 
I don’t feel such a compulsion any longer. Nothing interests me much, eating is a burden and it is hard to fall asleep. This sounds pathetic but I have not known a sober day since March. All I do is smoke, drink, and play video games and I am yet to achieve any sense of satisfaction or joy from it. I got a dog, I thought she would help morale, but alot of the times I find myself staring at the dog wondering if it will ever love me.
Is this all there is to life? You go through school miserable to get a miserable job and then you die. None of the adults in my life seem happy, my mom clearly wishes she had lived a better life and my stepdad is always too drunk to realize how miserable he really is. And in the rare moments when I do feel an impulse to do something, somebody always has to disparage me and shut me down. I just feel like a worthless sack of shit all the time and that I ought to be apologizing for my own existence. 
I know I have worth. You can make me a hundred thousand Hallmark cards about how amazing and unique of a person I am, but I don’t feel it. All I know is that in a few months I’m going to be living across the country and I really hope I can get over this post-feeling hopelessness before then, lest I have another miserable four years. 
If I could go back and see myself as a five year old, I would tell him that I was sorry. I failed him and spoiled so much life. The poor kid deserved more than me.",19Jun2020,1

59," I've been with this girl I met online for 9 months. I'm 21 and she's 18. I have never felt this way before, and I know she felt it too. for 8 months everything was going great, but for the past 4-3 weeks, it started to fall apart. A lot of minor and huge things happened, and she broke up with me, this was mine and hers first relationship. Here's what happened. About 4-3 weeks ago, she came to my place(we live 290km apart, but we meet every weekend and on holidays), and at my place we stayed for a almost 2 weeks, during that time we hardly went out together, I rented bikes, electrical scooters, so we would spend more time outside. But it was really hard to force her to go somewhere with me, we only went biking one time, and with scooters I had to put so much effort to get her out of the house, she always wanted to go back to my place and play computer games(VR). while playing games she met some guy, who I started to dislike. They spend a lot of time playing together, I told her I'm jelly and I don't like her being with him, did that for 4-5 days, and the last day I decided if she cares so much about some random guy on the internet more than me, then It's not worth it. That day, I put a lot of effort for her to remove him from friends list, she was always saying ""Why?"", ""Ur being unreasonable.""(P.S. I know u guys think it's toxic, but we had a relationship like this, she deleted all my female friends from real life. some of 4 y/o friendships, I'm fine with that, but I did the same to her.). That day we both cried, but she said she's sorry and that she now understood what she did so we moved on. Then we went back 290 km to her place, (she lives with mom, and still goes to school), at her place we spent 10 days, in those 10 days we never went outside, all she was doing is playing games(gta 5 rp), I felt not loved, not wanted. We were together, but not at the same time, if that makes sense. I was asking to play too, just so she'd stop, and tried to spend the time she gave me with her, but she always insistented(she later told me, she just thought I really wanted to play, but at that time I felt like she just didn't want to spend time with me). last 2 days were the hardest for me, I felt unloved, unhappy, and I wanted to go back home, I told her about it, about how I felt, that I was unhappy with how she acted, with how I didn't feel good staying 10 days in the room doing nothing, she understood, and apologized. She told me that after writing her final test, she'd come to me(1-2 days without her), but for last day she wanted to play as much so she could focus on me when we meet, I gave her space to play, but I felt really unloved, not cared about, she spend more time with her online friends than with me. The day she was supposed to come, I told her, I didn't see the future with a girl who doesn't clean after herself, doesn't go outside, and spends more time playing games than me, but I didn't say I don't love her. We decided to take a week long break, and I asked her to really think if she loves me, but it lasted only 1 day, She loved me, and I knew I loved her too, and was exited to begin spending more time with her, and going out more. But again, she asked for the rest of the day to spend playing with her friends, so when she comes her mind would be fully with me. The day came when she was supposed to come, I was asking her ""did you ask your mom if you can go?"" 3 times, every hour(her mom was sleeping or taking a shower), and she wasn't relying as usual because she was watching a movie. Again I stared to overthink, ""why is she not asking her mom, does she just want to spend more time playing"" (not I understand that's not it), she finally asked her mom, and she said no. Her mom needed some help that week. This is where I fucked up the most. I got angry, and told her so many bad things that I regret now, but I can't role back time. I understand how toxic I was now, and I want to get her back so I can treat her the way she deserves. of course there were other little things, but this is the general picture. I'll live a link in the pictures you can see our text, I went to her the next day with flower...(5h bus drive) to ask for an apology and a second chance. She said she'll think about it, and asked for time, but I still message her 2-3 times a day, saying I miss you, I love you or some other stuff, but she just doesn't answer. This is both of ours first serious relationship. ""Link of what I said in the comments"". What should I do, I need her back in my life. I realized it 2 seconds after saying ""I want to break up"".

For me it was a girl I knew in high school. We were in the same theater program and worked together on some shows. Then I started to drive her home after rehearsal, and I admitted to her that I wanted to kiss her. And she said she did too.

It was only about six months of a sort of ""friends with benefits"" situation except there was no sex, just kissing. At one point she even drunkenly confessed at a party that she might have a crush on me. Then my (undiagnosed but probable) depression kicked in and I broke it off. I went to college, she moved away (she was a year younger than me).

When she came back to the same university as me and we talked, she mentioned she had an open relationship but that she just wanted us to be friends. I hurt her with my breaking it off back in high school, and whenever I see her on my contacts list or pass her picture on tinder my heart sinks and I wish I had never broken it off. She's still a great friend, but I feel like it could have been more had I been less blind.

I went through a lot of shit in life wherein my parents and family turned out to be monsters, people disliked me because of the way I looked like, teachers joined hands to make fun of me even when I geew, went through a lot of racism, got beaten up and sexually and mentally abused and harassed by kids at school and college and the authorities did nothing, My best friends betrayed me for cute girls and the cool kids gang of the school and one almost planned my murder and I was going to hurt myself 

I am a Victim of Mental and Physical abuse and harassment at the hands of his Parents, their families, his Teachers, School Authorities, Bullies and a victim of Sexual Assault, Nepotism, Corruption and Selfish management of schools and colleges, Friends who betrayed me etc My journey has been tough with Depression, Anxiety, Bipolarity, Suicidal Thoughts and a lot of failures and thorns in his journey upto a point the pressure was getting too hard to bear but I got through this with a lot of thinking, my hardwork, perseverance. 

Please watch my specific video for instance in which I talk about Depression, Anxiety, Suicide, Bipolarity, Failures and how much we get affected by it and how many awful people become the factors to it but our life is our life right? 

https://youtu.be/3NBFjK0wcug

And then there is this whole playlist about my life and how I came to believe that after every dark cloud there is a clear blue sky and that If I'd do something to hurt myself then I'd regret it for the rest of my life. That I wanted to share with you and others going through this tough phase .

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL68bTLmYL-n4531bW-hmPF1vFoUOuMgRl

I hope my story helps you in anyway. Please hang in there.

If this helps you, please share this message with the ones you know who are going through their worst times so that they don't do something to themselves that they might regret doing. The least you can do is share it as a post or story on social media if you don't know whom you can send this to personally who is going through their worst time as many might not tell us what they are facing but if this catches their eye, I hope this makes a difference to them.

Also, if you are going through a severe phase of Bipolarity or battling panic attacks or Suicidal thoughts at a level when you feel like it's getting worse. Please seek a licenced Medical professional's help as they can help you get through this. Remember don't feel ashamed to seek help from the ones who can provide it to you if you could have access to it in any way possible. Because seeking professional help isn't wrong if it could actually help you in a lot of ways to feel better. 

If you  don't have any access to any medical resources living in a home like mine or even a worse house or country, I'd wanna say please don't do anything to hurt yourself. I'm begging you again. Please if you can, Listen to or watch the last video in the playlist or the whole playlist again and understand that nothing is hard and that you must have to be a warrior though it might be hard to fight back but please understand that your life matters to you and it's important and this struggle will be worth someday when you fight back and rise back up and win this battle to emerge out as a stronger human being all along.",19Jun2020,1

85,"Lately, whenever I head to bed or try to relax, my mind never seems to stop thinking. It’s almost an uncontrollable habit of mine now where when I try to sleep, even at the edge of falling asleep, my mind will think and wander endlessly.

It’s to the point where sometimes I have no choice but to focus on counting back from 1000 just to get my mind stuck on something utterly boring, just so I can finally rest.

Not sure why this is the case or why this started happening. Truthfully I think it’s ADHD but I was never diagnosed with that nor will I probably ever head to therapy due to my lack of self-care, which in of itself is quite fucked.

I dunno, it’s problematic. Where it feels as if I’m stuck in a dream-like state 24/7, kind of just flying by and disassociated from reality. Everything looks too bright or too dark like someone raised the contrast on a TV too high.

It’s a very odd place, I’m not sure what to really say or do. On top of this, my mind loves to keep repeating itself over and over again, especially catchy parts of songs where it will sound like a fucking broken record in my head.

Genuinely feel like I’m insane at times because it never ends. Only on some days these overwhelming odd sensations disappear but eventually they come back and I would feel so drained mentally but not physically.

I’m always tired at this point. It’s just odd. Not sure what else to say so I’ll leave it off here. Just wanted to finally say what’s been going on with me lately and wanted to know if this is normal or not. Thanks.",19Jun2020,1

95,"Hello..  
So, I don't really have someone to talk to, deeply or anything. I tend to lose friends, cause it's hard for me to keep in touch most of the time. And my best friend is really busy right now and I don't wanna stress them even more.  
  
Which is why I picked this subreddit I guess. I just need someone to talk to, maybe hear a different perspective on things.

I lived with my girlfriend for a year, in my apartment. The apartment is mine, I bought it and paid for it fully, not a lease. I finally felt like I have everything I wanted.. like this is the last girl, the girl that's gonna be with me till I'm old and grumpy. But I believe she.. possibly has some kind of a mental issue and she kept on switching between diffferent emotional states, one day she loved me and the other didn't feel a thing. There were many other factors and realizing now that writing that all out would make for a super LONG post I'm not gonna go to further details much. Point is.. everything went to shit. She cheated on me and broke up with me the next day.. moved out the same day.. grabbed all her remaining things and stuff in the next couple of days. I helped her move some stuff. And she was gone.

I never lived with anyone, ever. I never even wanted to, but with this girl I was almost instantly like ""fuck, I wanna live with you, do you wanna live with me too?"" and so we did. And I know that.. perhaps nothing is final and everything has an end, and theres ""plenty o fish"", and what not. I've heard that all through out my life and it does not calm me down, since this was the first girl I think I truly loved.. like a deep connection, first day click, everything and now I'm scared I won't find anyone else. We tried communicating and some stuff, after the break up. Right now we agreed to give her some time, to go to therapy (she feels she needs it), calm down, get her stuff together, etc. and she's gonna contact me some time later and we will see.. I don't know if that's stupid on my part ?

The main point I was gonna say is - I don't know how to deal with being in my apartment right now. It's been two months since the breakup, since she doesn't live here. Yet I still keep seeing her here, I still keep thinking about her here. Honestly most of the time I just feel like crap here, I cry, I think about death, think about dying in this apartment being something ""final"" about my life. I tried changing stuff around, bought some new BIG plants, drilled in curtains (which actually really changed the feel of the place), and some other stuff.. but nothing seems to help. I don't wanna move, since that would mean having to sell the place, look for something else, perhaps more money since apartment prices went even more up, it just seems crazy to move. And yet I don't wanna be here. How do you deal with this? Does it get better over time? Do you forget? I keep telling myself ""It's just a place, I'm gonna change it up, bring in some friends, live through something fun here, etc."" and that it might change.. but will it really? 

Honestly I'd kill for someone to chat with even privately, I'm full of it and .. I'm not in a great place right now, also given my .. ""mental state"" (since birth). So if there's anyone to talk to.. thanks.",19Jun2020,7
96,"Hi all,

Throwaway account here. 

I'll try to keep this brief. I'm 30 and live in the same house and city I grew up in. I don't like the city but I feel really unable to get out. I live with my parents but I'm planning on moving as soon as lockdown is over.

I'd planned to move out in my own city even though I feel really conflicted about this. I didn't move when I began uni (which I should have done) and now I feel like I've lost the nerve. I did move when I went to uni the second time to do my masters, I lived across the country. I loved the little city I was in, but a year was enough, it was really small and I couldn't enjoy myself there as a poor student. I also really struggled with not knowing anyone. I'm a real extrovert and spending time on my own was mentally and emotionally difficult. I also found it incredibly difficult to be away from my family. I am close to my family and my sister is my best friend. My dad is also ill at the minute and I hate being away from my sister too long, who also has mental health issues.

I don't like my job here, I don't have many friends and I feel like there's no opportunity to pursue any of my interests as there's not much culture here. I'm so torn because I suffer from the unholy triangle of low self esteem, depression and bad anxiety and being without my support network is hard for me. 

Every time I try to make a decision, I feel like outside forces are conspiring against me. There's no jobs at the wage I'd need to live somewhere else or now we're likely to come into a recession post lockdown. 
The best thing I can think is to move to the bigger city 2 hours away, but it is incredibly expensive there so I wouldn't have much of a life.  There's nowhere else in my country I'd really want to live. 

I've been torturing myself with this decision for about a decade now. Do I move away where things are expensive and I don't know anyone or stay where I'm not happy and have a support network? 

Please be kind.",19Jun2020,1

Hey y'all,

**Here's what I need help with:** pick a city (it can be your hometown or just a random one) and google stuff like ""mobile crisis response"", ""domestic violence shelter"", ""emergency shelter"", ""community mediation"", and anything else that might seem like a valuable resource for people in a crisis or conflict situation. If you find anything, can you post them in a comment here or DM them to me?

This is something I'm working on with a small group of people. Our goal is to make sure that people in every city/county in the U.S. know about the resources in their area that might, in certain situations, be a more suitable resource than simply calling 911. As far as I know, there is no longer a current database of mental health information related to U.S. police shootings, but in 2015, but the data showed that a person suffering from a psychiatric crisis was 16 times more likely to be killed by police. There are organizations in cities like Eugene, Oregon (CAHOOTS) that have all but taken over the 911 response to psychiatric/behavioral crisis emergencies. Most of the time they are able to de-escalate the situation, get the person stabilized, and refer them for continuing care. This is just one example of the infrastructure that exists in some cities and states, and we want to find and list as many resources as possible!

Any leads that get sent to us are added to a list, and then we personally call each organization to make sure they will be beneficial resource to post.

Thanks for reading and thanks in advance if you're able to help! I've been a lurker in this sub for a couple of years and I've always loved how positive and friendly everyone is (I did make a burner account for this post because a few people I know who talk about police-related stuff have been harrassed on reddit extensively by some very racist people...just trying to be extra safe). If this question is totally beyond the scope of this sub, please let me know and I'll continue on my search for a different sub to post in.

Another theory is that in the 11th century there was an administrative district in England named ""Fuccashire,"" named after a particularly active bull that really liked to get it on with the cows.  In this case ""fucca"" would have origins other than those of ""John le Fucker"" but I'm not sure what those origins are.

114,"Okay so basically, I went to sleep at around 4-5am and woke up at 16:47pm, my mum comes home about two hours later and says ""sorry I've fightened you"" and I responded with ""it's okay"" because I thought it was over what happened yesterday which was completely different, then I realised something and asked ""about yesterday?"" and my mum said ""No, this morning"" I was confused and told her ""what do you mean? I was asleep since 4am, I woke up about an hour ago""

She then explained to me this story, before she went to work someone was meant to come in the house to check the roof at 8am, they never came, she calmy opened the door, went into my room and said in a calm voice ""Hey, you awake?"" I apparently woke up and responded by screaming and shouting in fear, that part confused me the most, she then said after that ""Hey, are you listening? The man never came, I'm going to work"" I responded with an 'okay' sign with my hand and responded with the usual ""love you too, see ya later"" and she went because she said I seemed awake and conscious

What weirded me out was that I do not remember any of these events happening before and was the first time I've experienced something like this, but who knows maybe it wasn't the first time, whatever

I started instantly was analysing what made me not remember anything, I kept asking her ""are you sure i was actually doing this? If I really did this I would've remembered because I was apparently conscious and even responded so I would've remembered but I don't at all"" she said that I was even sat on the bed
I asked ""but you walked in calmy, why would I respond with screaming and panic when it was just you and the cat in the house?"" she said she had no idea but everything that happened was real

Everytime im asleep, I sleep like I'm in a coma so most of the time my mum couldn't wake me up even with something loud happening unless I was just going into sleep, but I was full on sleeping and not even half-awake

I did try and look for some stuff in Google, apparently its sleep drunkenness and is linked with mental illness disorders, it kind of makes sense because I do have PTSD and SPD, i do not have DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder) however because of my ptsd I do dissociate but it happens when I'm awake and conscious, so it was odd

Hearing everything that happened and not remembering is like my subconscious went into autopilot mode is very very odd and bizarre as it was the first time something like this happened

I have a deep appreciation for those who actually work for a living. Their stories are no less complex nor no less important than anyone else's'.  


Anyone's life is a mosaic or a painting,  just some have words for colors and some don't. Doesn't mean that it isn't art. That's why it's always so quiet in galleries and museums because they speak for themselves.",19Jun2020,2

125,"Maybe writing all of this down will help me feel at least a little bit lighter. I’ve told some friends, I’ve told one of my brothers, I want to tell my parents so they can understand but the problem is I know they won’t understand or care anyways. 

It started with a stupid argument. The night before, I was upset with my dad for not listening to me. I had said the same thing to him, over five times, and he didn’t listen to me once. It was clear he didn’t listen, because he told one of my brothers the complete opposite of what I’d said. I got annoyed with him, as anyone would when you repeat something over and over only to not be heard any of the times. He took it as a personal attack, as he often does. 

The next morning, everything was fine. My parents, my two older brothers and I were all sitting in the living room and relaxing. My oldest brother mentioned going on a walk. Now, one things my parents love to do is talk passive aggressively and spitefully about us when they’re right in front of us, like we aren’t even there. It hurts me, a lot, and I’ve said it before and they continue to do it. My mother said that my brother should take me with him. My father said something along the lines of, “Good luck, spirituallycynical would never do something good for her.” It rubbed me the complete wrong way, and I got verbally upset with him. I told him that I don’t like when he says these things, I turned it around on him and asked him when the last time he went on a walk was (he doesn’t, he lays on the couch and watches television and occasionally does the lawn.) He responds to it by saying I’m being SO disrespectful, that he would never talk to his father like that. He brings up me being upset with him last night for not listening to me as another instance of disrespect, and says I need to learn to respect my parents. 

Now this part is what really REALLY upsets me. I love my older brothers very much, and I didn’t say this as to not throw them under the bus, but I am the MOST respectful child in our house. Although it’s mostly joking, my brothers curse at my father like nothing. “Fuck you, fuck off, screw you, shut the fuck up, no fucking way” etc. I have never in my life said anything like this to my father. And he tells me I’m being disrespectful for defending myself when he’s being hurtful to me? After he brought up the night prior, I made it clear that if it had been the other way around he’d be equally as annoyed at me for not listening to him. The arguing escalated, and it ended up with him screaming at me to shut up, to just go back to my room like a cave woman (I’m a pretty depressed person so I spend most of my time in my room because it’s my safe space). I go to my room, I’m very upset of course, crying over all of it. I hear my oldest brother trying to defend me for a little bit, but my dad just yells at him too. 

The next few days, I stayed in my room as much as possible. I hardly eat, only really leave to go to the bathroom, but when my dad goes to bed then I feel okay to go to the kitchen, pantry, etc. 

It’s been weeks since then, literally multiple weeks, and we haven’t resolved this. The reason we haven’t resolved this, is because for my entire LIFE, my parents have NEVER apologized or resolved and conflicts with their kids. The cycle is as follows: they fight with us over something that isn’t even important, they turn the fight personal and sling in some passive aggressive and ad hominem jabs, we go our separate ways for a few days to a week, and after that it’s just supposed to be normal and we’re expected to get over it. That’s how it’s been for my entire life. No apologies for hurting feelings or saying things they shouldn’t have, no sitting down and talking over what happened to come to a mutual understanding. And now, as an adult, I’m realizing that’s why I’m so useless with my own feelings. They’ve never ONCE taken accountability for hurting their kids feelings and admitted they were wrong for it. They’ve blatantly disregarded the effect their words have had on their kids, and in doing that, it’s obvious that they don’t care about our feelings. We’re expected to get over the hurt they give to us (My mother told me a few days ago to get over it all, but my father gets a free pass apparently) and to move on as to not disrupt the status quo and to not inconvenience them with our feelings and I’m so tired of it. So if my own parents don’t care about my feelings, why should I? I spend so much time and effort suppressing my feelings until it blows up and I have a nuclear meltdown because I don’t know the right way to acknowledge my own feelings and be able to move forward from them in a healthy way. I am absolutely shocked that I haven’t entered into any abusive relationships with the precedent my parents have set for me. 

It’s weeks later, and I’ve been spending most of my days in my room again after this revelation. I’ve been depression napping most of the day, spend most of my days in my bed. My father lives his life like he’s so unbothered, laughing like everything is normal. Like he doesn’t even care that we aren’t speaking. And that tells me that he doesn’t care about my feelings at all. He cares so much about being right and his pride, he can’t even bothered to apologize to his only daughter for hurting her. I spoke to my brother about all of it, and he acknowledged that neither of them ever apologize and that in all honesty, my dad probably doesn’t care about it or remember. But I’m laying here thinking about how insignificant I am to both of my parents for them to treat my feelings like they don’t even exist. That it wouldn’t even matter if something bad happened to me, because they would keep on living their lives unbothered without me in it. 

I’m sorry for the long read, and if anyone even stayed until now, I appreciate the time you spent listening to my experience. I don’t know how this situation will possibly improve, but I’ll keep hoping for a miracle.",19Jun2020,1
129," People trying to make it, looking forward to a future, suddenly we find ourselves trapped in our homes.

 I always had some social anxiety, struggled dating and as of last year, I finally got a better paying job. A career doing animation.

So my goal those year was to finally fix things in my life, hoping to meet someone. I wanted to try new things like get a motorcycle, get thinner, move closer to my job and feel overall more confident.

Over the course of 1 weekend after reading headlines about china, everything stopped.

 Everyone was held hostage by an unseen killer.

Fast forward to now, we’re slowly opening up, but we keep hearing about spikes.

 It feels like everything is pointless now. Everything we tried to do is for nothing.

Combine that now with civil unrest and talk of civil war. It makes me worried about the future of this country. People are getting more angry. Law enforcement walking out, and without a job or sense of purpose, who doesn’t wanna join a movement to feel like they’re part of something. Whether it is for police reform or if you wanna join some alt right or alt left faction.
Society is at odds, and our leaders are no help.

 Hell, even my family is divided.

Life feels empty now and the world unstable. Idk what to look forward to. I wanna wake up tomorrow and feel like this is all a dream.",19Jun2020,3

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as s was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

135,"I'm cutting down. The plan is to continue to cut down until I'm not reliant on nicotine anymore. I wanted to just quit cold turkey, but I know that I'll give in to my temptation or my anger.

I've been smoking on and off since I was a teenager, but I've been a heavy smoker for almost five years now, if I were to continue it would be five years in the middle of July. 

So far I do not consider my current attempt to quit (beginning yesterday) a failure, but I would if I'd gone cold turkey and caved by this point. 

I feel like I've made some good progress, I guess. I'm normally a pack a day smoker. Yesterday I only had six and didn't have one until I'd been up for about five hours. Today I've only had three and I've been up for 8 hours. I'm happy as long as I do not exceed six today. I'm not planning to have another one for another three or four hours, depending on when my head starts to really hurt. 

Sorry for the long ass ramble about my own progress, I just wanted to share it with someone because I'm not telling anyone IRL right now. I'm not even telling people I know online. I don't want to hear it if this doesn't work out for some reason and I cave in. I'm positive that this will work out for me, there's no reason why it shouldn't. I'm hoping to have stopped completely by the end of the month. That would really make me feel good about myself in all honesty.

138,"So.. I just ordered delivery from a place nearby. I just need to get this situation off my chest. I understand people make mistakes. I ordered about $45 of food (multiple days) and I always give a $15 delivery tip, regardless of the delivery distance or food cost.

I watched the person drive into another area in my apartment complex thinking they were delivering to the wrong place; however, it occurred to me that there might be another order at the same time (there was). My complex is pretty remote, which led me to thinking I was the only order. I get inside and open the order, and not a single item is correct.. so I try and contact the delivery guy through the delivery service and end up talking to a rep.

Anyhow.. I just accept my fate of getting the wrong order, because the person accidentally mixed up the order. I just wanted them to know that and was not looking to get the food re delivered, so I started eating the wrong order.

The delivery person shows up 20 minutes later saying they messed up and gave me the wrong order apologetically. I told them that I already started eating the wrong order, so they should just give my order to the other person. They then said ""No I messed up, I will just go back to the restaurant and get the right order.""

Me feeling horrendously horrible at this point, because I dug into somebody else's order, convinced the delivery person to let me pay for their order. The other person's order was $45, so that is what I paid. So all in all, I ended up paying about $100 tonight (45 over what I paid) and got a screw up and grievance in return. Honestly, it would have been better if the delivery person did not return.

The reason I give a $15 tip, which I think is high, is because I highly appreciate delivery people going out in corona to cater to my lazy arse. This is regardless of the food cost. I have had delivery the past few weeks with costs of much less than $45. I think that people compete for high delivery tips, so I would expect them to do a good job. However, part of me thinks: ""I paid a good tip for you to deliver 1.2 miles down the road and you still got it wrong.""",19Jun2020,2

141," 

So i was with my girlfriend for half a year,that was my only romantic relationship i have ever had.

I have totally fallen in love but due to factors (id was destroying me mentally,lets say she was toxic but i know i could have been better boyfriend,i understand that it wasn't 100% her fault)

After half year without her,during my brithday around 23 pm,she wrote me messege that she wishes me hb and that that time together was special for her,

that moment when she wrote it to me i can honestly say,it was better than any drug i took,it was magical.

We meet and it was great,then we had to meet again and she totally didn't respond or responded day before planned meet that she can'[t.](https://t.it/) It was hurting me really much because one of the reason why i broke up was her problem with commitement.

So i decided ok i won't write to her and humilitate myself.

Again after 3 months she invited me to party to her and it was great,we kissed and i wanted to meet again and still she didn't respond.

Last month she wrote to me,

""whats up""

I was very indiffrent about it but started writing with her and it was good again,and then when i asked her if she would come to talk or go for a walk,(she lives close to me),she refused again,so i told her to not to write me again and blocked her.

And today there was small meeting with friends and all my memories came back,i don't know if i made mistake,i dont understand anything

all melanholy and memories came back to me,and all i think is that i made some mistake or hurt her,
