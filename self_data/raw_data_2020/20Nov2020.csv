1,I guess what I'm referring to is clear enough. But I haven't seen it put bluntly in this form. The people who can separate parents from children at the border can tolerate the death of parents due to the pandemic due to their heartlessness.,20Nov2020,1
2,"Sometimes we’ll be watching quiz shows on TV and I’ll get quite a few of the answers right and she’ll say, “I didn’t know any of them. You’re way smarter than me.” And not in a joking way. She’ll get really self-conscious about it.

Or I’ll tell her about some event in history and she’ll say, “I didn’t know that. I’m so dumb!”

I keep telling her not to put herself down and that we’re both smart in different ways. For instance, she’s an AMAZING pianist!

I’m a novelist and she’s not much of a reader but she always reads my drafts and gives insightful comments like “No, that person would never act like that or say that.”

She often says, “I’m averagely intelligent.” She’s not, but even if she were, what’s wrong with that?

I may have better general knowledge and pop culture knowledge than her, but so what? She knows a lot about the subjects she’s interested in, and she has an incredible work ethic and emotional maturity.

She works with little kids for a living and they all love her. In fact, everyone does - I’ve never seen anything like it. She is so loved! She doesn’t have a mean bone in her body and would do anything for anyone.

She doesn’t know this but I’ve saved every single one of our text messages and I re-read them every morning just to brighten my day.

So guys and girls, please stop putting yourselves down!",20Nov2020,1

She seems to be happy most of the time. When I tell her that I am having a hard time, suicidal thoughts, or stressed out she turns against me. Last night she came into our place and caught me on the suicide hotline.

She went to the kitchen and complained about my cooking. I asked her to talk about the phone call and she went to the bedroom and locked the door. I was sitting on the couch in an emotional teeter totter. Deserve to kill myself, or will the pain I inflict on my family be too much?

We have a rule where we don't talk to others about personal matters unless we explicity say that we want to. It's a little relationship quirk, but it's very important to me. I started to get concerned calls from a lot of contacts. It was very embarrassing to say the least.

The trust violation has really hurt me. Today we went for an outing that she was really looking forward to. I felt hurt about the past and sort of afraid because she has been violent and has lied publicly about me to diminish my character in the past. I lost my dream job because she falsely accused me of constraining her to an isolated location. She wasn't even working and I paid for her vehicle, mma training sessions, and all other expenses.

She had her MMA friends beat the shit out me. It was a terrible, dehumanizing experience. That was our initial break up.

A few months later she calls me because she is pregnant with our son. I decide to man up, swallow my recently bruised pride, and take care of her and my future child. That requires me to end my employment and move to a state that I hate.

Tragically our son dies. I may have not loved the circumstances that brought my son into my life but I loved my son. I will forever be scarred by the memories of giving him CPR when I knew that he was dead.

I know the taste of cold baby blood forced into my mouth during CPR. That is impossible to forget.

A few months later my role model sister hung herself in an RV. About 90 days from todays date.

I have been having a very hard time.",20Nov2020,1

We chatted all the time, exchanged pictures...well until I asked to video chat ( I had to see that dazzling smile in real time) shocker! Video call are not allowed(this is after we've been chatting on whatsapp +1 (845) 402-0218)!!! 

Huge red flag! So I did some digging on google, turns out it's a pretty common scam!! A quick reverse image search and it turned out that  my handsome marine is a victim of identity faith, and some scammers have been using his pictures.

17,"I'm sure some people won't believe me, but here goes nothing. 

I, uh, I have a thing for CWC. There I said it. I have a crush on the crazy Sonichu creator. I'm a bit ashamed of it, but I know I can't really stop it. 

I became an avid Christorian during the summer of the COVID quarantine, and was on several Chris-Chan related chat groups throughout the months. 

I genuinely find Chris-Chan to be an interesting person. 

I am autistic myself, and I fit in decently well in real life society. I'm a physically fit woman who loves bettering her life and is well-respected among neurotypicals in my area. I have discipline to make my life better, unlike Chris. Autism is not a solid excuse for their laziness and spiral into delusion. 

But since August, parts of me have been feeling repressed. I thought these weird feelings in my throat and stomach were a result of me being disgusted by this person, but the fascination was too strong to be that.

 They'd be on my mind every day and I've been having weird fantasies of: 

 &gt;!Being the Kimmi sex doll from the ""classic era.""!&lt; 

&gt;!Cakefarts, for obvious reasons.!&lt;

&gt;!And my most obscure one, making out with Classic Chris in the mall while forcing the Man in the Picklesuit to watch us.!&lt;

I literally cannot help what I have feelings for. I have had a fat guy/ ugly bastard fetish ever since I had a sexuality and I should've known this weird crush thing was coming. It seems like no other woman has fetishes as ugly and weird as mine, and it makes me feel a bit left out. 

I feel like a degenerate or mentally ill because of one stupid thing in my mind I can't help. I know I am not a degenerate because:

 I have actual hobbies. I love weightlifting and I work out 4 to 6 times a week. 

I have a good relationship with my professors, coaches and parents, who all place high expectations on me. 

 I talk to counselors to seek mental help, and I don't use my autism as a crutch. I am trying everything to be a mentally sane individual. 

My counselor told me that nobody in the real world is going to fucking care about who you have feelings for as long as it isn't hurting anyone else (i.e. crushes on real animals, children, serial killers, etc.). 

All I can do now is live in the moment, and know that these feelings are not permanent. 

Edit: I have a boyfriend and I know that if he knew this about me, he'd get fucking upset. He's a chubby gamer guy too, so he's my type, but it's best to not tell him about it, which pains me.",20Nov2020,1

If I quit I can’t claim unemployment. They know how dirt poor I am. And they want to bring up how poor I am, and ask me if I’m sure I want to work here? Of course I don’t but I need the money. I do my job right everyday, come home, and do it all again the next day.

What would you do? I tried not sleeping at the morning, holding my sleep up to the evening and it worked that time, but the next day it was as usual. I tried just going to sleep at midnight to wake up early, i woke up during the night as I didn't feel like resting. I also tried some melatonin integrators but they have little effect.

This lady starts ranting about how stupid shutting down is and that every 100 years a pandemic hits.

I just think of my husband and how much it terrifies me to think of him getting covid.

28,"I’ll try to keep this short and to the point. I am a 20 year old who has never had a father figure in my life and I believe this has caused me some issues now in my current life. My problem is, I find myself not thinking for myself a lot of the time.

For example, if I start watching someone like Joe Rogan or Jordan Peterson, I have a hard time deciding how to take the advice they give and think of it in my own way. Instead I hear the advice they give and think to myself that THEIR way of thinking is the right way, which I don’t think is a healthy way of living. Living like this tends to mean I don’t have my own opinions and sometimes I even act like the person I’ve spent the most time learning about. Another major issue with this is not knowing when to deem something that person said as wrong. Since I tend to put a lot of trust into these people I never know when to step back and realize, “Ok maybe what they’re saying isn’t true this time.”

I think a lot of this stems from not having a father figure and due to that, clinging to anyone I see trust worthy enough as a model for who I should be.

My question is, how can I take in their content in a way that allows me to take what they say, learn from it, improve myself from it, yet know when to stop and say “Ok this isn’t right, how should *I* really be seeing this” whenever I don’t entirely agree? How do I stop using other more influential people as a model for myself and how do I start becoming my OWN person who has their OWN thoughts?",20Nov2020,1

My life started with misfortune and it only kept spiralling.
What little memory I have of *my*self, I grasp onto, I act out in my head, where it is safe, but it only makes the lack of feeling and enjoyment in the real world all the more noticeable.

My illness over three years brought pure misery upon me, stripping me from all I held dear, naked, pure.
Each day, suffering, uncertainty, how long will I make it? Why me? What have I done?

But one thing it gave me: Time with myself, a period of contemplation and alone conversation, pure isolation.
A monologue, starved off any emotions, any outer factors, just myself.


I used my last bit of energy and luck happened to be in my favour, I found a diagnosis, salvation, I thought.

Surgery, my body was opened, people carefully mending my vessel, disfiguring my once beautiful body as a byproduct, one of the few things I was happy enough with to not be pained by it, despite gender identity issues.
But if that was the price for my life, so shall it be, I was more than happy to pay it.

A magic mountain, high above it seemed like, beautiful, until I realized I was at the very bottom of it, having tumbled down to the foot of the giant I once tried to conquer.

Waves wash over me, all the emotions coming back, all the pain, now realized, fully processed, I feared this would happen, my sober, starved self foresaw this.

Yet I was there, weak, feeling worse during my recovery than I was, I felt ungrateful, horrible, why was I not happy?
So much laid ahead of me, but at the same time, nothing, my family urging me to get out, no connection with former friends.

I had experienced things nobody I knew had, as if I spoke a different language.
Yearning for love after a lifetime of abuse, was probably natural, my body and my soul hurt, I wanted a soothing warmth to comfort it, all those nights in pain, physical and psychological had left me starved, damaged, seeping the precious blood of confidence I had managed to accumulate prior to my downfall.

Online I met someone, the urge of my family, and the urge of decisions led to me fleeing my country, the negativity, the bad and good memories in an attempt to start over.

I was mistaken, immaturely I had acted and now pay the price for.
In this country, I do not feel at home, but nor do I in my home anymore, everything falls apart.

Who I love turns out to be different than I hoped, I love them, and yet, it hurts, my previous words of caution regarding sex had not worked, I was damaged, now even my sexuality in shards, cutting my brittle skin.

All words out of my mouth, falling into the void.

My identity, soul, sexuality, stripped, squeezed into a form, recycled into something more desireable.
Their words of comfort don't reach me anymore, I try to hear, I try to smile and ease their fears, their sadness, but I can't help but break and yearn for the touch of someone who doesn't hurt, who understands me.


Myself, the only person I can truly still love and trust, but can't be alone with anymore.

I don't want to be this facade and yet... I have lost my self.

Like an urge to rip my skin off, I can't be like this anymore, I want to get out of here, I feel ashamed, humiliated by everything, present, memory, the things to come.. every touch, every word, it shames me.

And yet I depend, unable to provide for myself in this land, in this state, wanting to love but struggling to.

It's unbearable.",20Nov2020,1

All the time all that runs through my mind is all the pain and suffering others are feeling and that I'm living life unscathed. I'm originally from Pakistan now living in Canada and most of the time all that runs through my head are the faces of the poverty stricken. I constantly replay the faces of those I couldn't or didn't help. I'll be eating and thinking of the people who haven't eaten for days. I can't help but think of those who are suffering immensely. People that are stuck in their homes in horrific situations because of lockdown. 

I understand that you can't help everyone. I send money to my uncle back home sometimes and he'll pass it on to those in need. How can I stop living my life like this? How can I stop feeling guilty for existing and living a good life even though others are going through terrible times?

* ESPN
* Then you hide it behind region blocks etc

Here's how to get my business back

Get all the content in one service, with no region locks for a reasonable price, say $19.99 or maybe even $24.95 monthly. Let me download that content to my device and we'll be happy pals deal?

Thing is I only like to play one or two games at a time, so I don't really stay  long. I could have played one game with them so sometimes I think it's weird that I'm saying farewell to a stranger. But anyway I somehow have this wired so I can't not say farewell.",20Nov2020,1
47,"I'm a senior and a few months ago I've turned 18. This year I'm taking high school final exams that give me the points necessary for getting into university. However, since sophomore year, I've slowly started breaking down. Did my best to avoid it, got new hobbies, exercised, the whole nine yards, but it just wouldn't go away. Tried talking about it with my parents, they weren't supportive, nor did they want to send my to a psych for help, or at least some assessment. I've started this year hanging on by a thread and can barely get myself to study or try at all any more. I decided to go see my school's psychologist, and after a month of adjusting schedules and failed meetings, I finally talked to her for the first time two weeks ago.

Turns out the bouts of crying, selective muteness, and overall feelings of helplessness that I had since the ripe age of 7 are indeed anxiety attacks. Turns out having suicidal ideations isn't normal. Turns out having such bad memory that you can't remember your friends' names isn't something most people deal with. In part, it was a relief, to have those issues acknowledged. I was referred to a psychiatrist whom I visited yesterday. After an hour and a half and 4 pages of writing down my mental (un)health, I was offered comfort, continued meetings, and a screening for ADD (which I've suspected I've had for some time) in short. I'm taking steps to getting better, though I'm anxious all the same because I have to do this behind my parents' backs. I guess this is my first mission as an adult. I'm truly grateful for the little progress I've made and for what there is yet to come. For the first time in a while I feel like there's something good awaiting me at the end of it all. If all goes well I just might go through this. 

Thanks for reading :')",20Nov2020,1
49,"I met him on my 1st session of my class,

Yah it was embarrassing to talk,

as it was a difficult task.

It started with his HEYY! I said him too.

I didn't knew him, neither he knew me,

Like I felt a nice connection,

as he wasn't sounding creepy.

I was feeling all alone, as I didn't know anyone,

And all were unknown.

Slowly we talked, slowly we met,

Together we sat, and the more we text.

He helped me out when I needed the most,

From sharing seats to sharing toasts.

He made me happy, he made me laugh,

He helped me in maps, I helped him in crafts.

He cared for me, he stood with me,

And I was happy the way I used to be.

More calls-more chats all goods and bad we solved at our own, all ups and downs we handled with grace and about everything we were assured about.

All day and night he was all in my mind,

Well! Do I need any reason behind?

Later he proposed me with all true words,

Though I found no faults but respect from girls.

I rejected as I wanted to know him more,

He told he'll wait until I'm all sure.

Even through all rumours or lies, he made me smile even when twice or thrice.

We spent a good time and shared a great bond, and made each other more strong and strong.

With all those efforts he proved he was a good guy, that won't stopped me to give it a chance,to give it a try.

He was happy, and I was too,

As we together were happy, strong and true.

0 conditions, 0 complaints,

I was his favorite, he was my main.

Everything was perfect, everything was great,

Together we studied, together we ate.

I LOVED WHEN I DIDN'T WANT,

I TRUSTED WHEN I WAS WARNED.

somewhere btw i heard he wanted to over it all,

50,"I know it’s a cliche, but whenever I’m not surrounded by people, I feel empty and it doesn’t take long for that to turn dark, and it’s gotten to the point where I feel like my friends probably just feel like they’re babysitting me all the time.

About two months ago, my then-girlfriend of three years cheated on me, emotionally. We talked about it and she let me look through some of her messages to figure out what had really happened, and essentially, this guy got his friend to befriend her, gain her trust, and then slowly wear her down and convince her she needed to break up with me and be with this other guy. It took a month or so, but you could see in the messages how she was slowly wearing down and it honestly kinda looked like brainwashing (I know I’m biased, but a friend of ours looked at the messages too and was the first to bring up that idea).

I told her if she cut contact with them and focused on us and repairing whatever issues we had that led up to all of this, I could forgive her and move on. She said she needed some time to process everything that happened (there was some manipulation and pressure placed on us, without going too much into detail, the guy’s friends basically sent me screenshots of their conversations, and then tried to contact her mom, but all while using fake accounts and google voice numbers and VPNs or whatever). I said I could give her til the end of the week. She decided she wanted to stay with me and stop talking to this guy. But then the same day, this guy’s friend hits her up, and she decides she needs more time. I said I could give her a couple more days, and at the end of that, she comes to the same decision, wanting to stay with me. But then the guy talks to her, and she changes her mind again. We officially broke up 6 weeks ago. 2 days after we broke up, the guy’s friend gets drunk and admits to a mutual friend about the manipulation and the guy’s involvement.

When I tell her what happened, she said she wished I hadn’t told her, because it didn’t change anything and she didn’t care. After she left, I started laughing hysterically and almost drove off a bridge (called a friend who calmed me down, and have seen a counselor about this a couple of times, and I’m safely at the point where I don’t constantly think about ending everything). Two weeks after ending our 3 year long relationship, she starts dating the guy officially, and I had an epiphany. Whoever she is now isn’t who I fell in love with. That woman is long gone, and I don’t see any sign she’s ever coming back. Who she is now has no care or respect for me, or herself, or anyone.

Then comes 11/11. I’m a huge math nerd (majoring in it) and 11/11/2020 was going to be our 1000 days, and we had so much planned and it was just supposed to be such an amazing day. But then driving around our city all the time was such a pain to me all of the time, because she and I would just find places in the city where we had never gone before in our spare time, so there wasn’t anywhere I could go without thinking of her. And so I decided I would either leave the city, or I’d kill myself. As you know, it’s past 11/11, and so I chose the former. I moved states and left my friends and social circle behind. I have friends and family in the state I’m in right now, and things were going alright for some time.

But after I settled down and the excitement cooled off, I just keep getting these feelings of emptiness. What’s the point of anything if I can do everything right, put my all into a relationship, give someone my heart and soul, and it ends how it did? When I ask people, they say that’s just life. I say that’s just bullshit, and that’s not a world I want to live in. The woman I spent my entire adult life with moved on after two weeks, while knowing her current boyfriend manipulated the brains out of her to be with her, and now they’ve been together for a month, and all I can think about today is if she loves him. If she’s told him if she loves him. Because in the weeks preceding her meeting him and his friend, we were in the best spot we had ever been in. For the first time, she felt secure about our future (her mom doesn’t like my ethnicity and that caused some doubts before). Just a couple of weeks before meeting them, she was talking about how she wants to make it a habit to go road tripping every weekend. Just a week before, she was telling me she couldn’t wait until we moved in together. Days before meeting them, she got me a phone case with us on it and the word “Love”. And it’s all stupid but it means something to me. Because when I looked at her after the breakup, after she had gone to him, I didn’t recognize her. The love of my life, my best friend, the one I thought I’d raise my children with and die old with? She’s gone. And people say that people change. But not like this. It feels like she knows deep down how shitty what she’s doing is, but she can’t face her guilt so she just shoved it aside and kept moving towards what made her feel guilty, so she could just immerse herself in it to become numb to it. I stood up to my parents in the beginning to be with her, and ultimately, they approved of the relationship. I changed universities to be with her. I worked my ass off to get promoted to change jobs so I could always support us. I got an apartment rather than saving money by staying with my parents just so we could have a place to ourselves. The decisions I made were ultimately decisions that benefitted me as well, even after the relationship ended, but it was all still for her, and she was always there for me and she loved me and cared for me right up until she didn’t. And it sincerely feels like she disappeared.

Some of my friends say to just move on. I don’t love her romantically anymore, and I’ve been trying to get myself into the dating scene, but that sucks in a completely new environment during a pandemic. Others say to just forget about her and stop looking for answers. But let’s say your parents or SO or sibling or whoever you care about most just disappeared out of nowhere. How long til you stop trying to figure out what happened to them? I know it’s not exactly the same, but in my head, it really feels like it.

What’s the point of any of it if anyone can just do a 180 in half a second and turn your life around? I’m taking care of myself - I’ve started working out and studying harder and spending more time with friends. But none of it seems to matter because at the end of the day, I’m still here feeling hollow while she’s out there with a guy she’s never met in person who has her just wrapped around his finger.",20Nov2020,1

During class my teacher asked me why people used to think the book was controversial and he asked my opinion. I said: _'It's controversial, but I like a bit of perversity.'_

Well, I do, but not in that kind of way. But my teacher looked kind of shocked, as if it were me who was constantly recommending these books.

I clarified by saying that it's interesting to see what is going on inside the mind of an artist. I said: 'Not in that kind of way, but it's interesting when an author writes this down.'

I mean, it's a sensationalist piece of writing. Don't we all like that a bit?

57,"IDK, I guess I'd share my biggest fear. I never really gave thought to any of my fears because I never was afraid of much. Certain things may have frightened me but I never gave thought to what I actually feared, that was, until recently. And now that I think back on it, it's been around for a long time.

 Anyways, my biggest fear is technically termed, **Agoraphobia**. That's basically the fear of feeling in an unsafe situation without any escape. For me, that happens to be large, vast, sprawling, open spaces. I'm talking large plans or flatlands with only a few or no hills, or mountains, little or no trees, stuff like that. I think it may have stemmed from me learning that tornado vortexes form more often in flat land when I was a little kid. Whatever the case, it turned into a really big thing for me. I hated when we would go on road trips and spend 30 minutes driving through vast flat desert-like area or visiting relatives that live in Oklahoma on the great plains. I also hate more that anything driving over or through large oil refinery areas. Things that really amplify these situations are overcast skies or really clear skies; basically if the sky happens to be one color all the way around. I don't have panic attacks or anything like that even though I may internally start to panic. I just hate it. When I draw pictures, I fill them up with hills and cityscapes and trees so that I don't have to look at a place that seems like its in a flat space, I fill the skies with birds, clouds, skyscrapers, and I never leave out the sun. Yes, it adds to the scene but, for me, it keeps me from feeling a panic when I look at the picture. As a matter of fact, when I am drawing it, I can't wait until I fill up the picture. When I sleep at night, my worst nightmare happens to be my Mom driving so fast that my stomach drops while we head into a great open plain while the skies are totally white. Also, nothing gets me worse than vast whiteness. Blankness. Whenever I am in a place like this, I feel like something giant is going to come out of nowhere and I'll be running but there won't be anywhere to hide and I'll be running forever. Most of all, I feel small and like I'm going to be crushed by the vast openness. 

And another thing, it's not the feeling loneliness. I feel like everyone in the world could be standing around me in the Great Plains and I'd still feel panicky. If I was on a cruise liner, I'd be alright until we went so far out into the ocean that I couldn't see anything but water and sky for miles around. 

So, yeah, I thought I'd share that.",20Nov2020,1

I recently turned 19 years old. Like the last two birthdays have been, it was one to forget. Outside of the romance and relationship I've had people literally shit on me, my goals and aspirations go to complete garbage, and the only thing that makes me keep going to today is knowing that there's someone out there with a much worse situation than I do, and that I should be thankful I at least have some things to cherish in life, like having a healthy family and stability financially.

I've come out of High School with my last year being 2019, and throughout that year I was really close friends with a girl, and it was weird because I liked her but not to the extent of a relationship or even marriage, but I felt that the affection was more than just a 'friend'. School had ended late 2019 (October ish) and because of issues and dramas that had happened with me and her that were caused by people around us, I was framed to having broken her trust to her, which clearly wasn't the case and I was completely oblivious to this. She later this year in 2020 clarified with me everything that had happened last year and we both resented the people who we both called friends at the time. Anywho, right after school had ended we both still had distanced from each other, and in December I went through a period of talking to virtually no one, sad and depressed at my personal issues that I won't need to talk about in this post.

Come January 2020 and we start talking again, and I missed her at that stage, and she indirectly hinted the same, and then it hit me that I needed to confront her and let her know my feelings about her. She was shocked, and was a bit hesitant at the start to give me a response, but that was only because she was unsure of how to respond to me and confront to me about her own affection for me likewise. At that stage, after confronting I felt a relief, and we both started talking again and the way we described our connection was something a ""little more than friends"" but not exactly a relationship. Without the expectations, without the need to be intimate. We thought it would be a great idea to keep each other in company, she was going through her own difficulty and personal issues, and to push and motivate each other for our goals for 2020.

Months pass by and it was until July where this kind of dynamic between us was similar. We were obviously getting to know each other more and more and we'd both realised that we knew nothing about each other during the two years we were friends at school.

Slowly slowly around the July-August mark we started to get more affectionate towards each other, and starting getting more intimate. That's where I finally saw the potential of having a relationship with her, and she felt the same with me as our bond and connection was only growing and growing. We are also both from the same culture, and with that comes the assumption that a relationship is only a gateway to marriage. Keep in mind, at the start of the year and previously in 2019 I never saw myself ever getting near even a relationship with this girl, everything about her seemed completely different to what I wanted in a girl and what her lifestyle revolved around.

This vibe kind of continues throughout August and September, where she started getting really into me, thinking about me 24/7, about everything to do with me. To be fair I was thinking of her for most of the day, but I didn't realise how intensely she was feeling for me until now in November (will get to this later). We would meet up more often together and have more intimate moments than before.

Our dynamic at this stage was completely different to the one we had intended at the start of the year, and there was no going back at this stage, nor did we feel like we wanted to go back to it. However, we also started getting into more conflicts and arguments than we were normally accustomed to, and while this didn't obviously change my feelings towards her. I went through a very weird phase throughout October. I felt very down because of some stuff that had happened and had reoccurred many times prior. I was questioning myself a lot and the phone calls that were such a regular between us had started to slowly decrease. I found myself wanting to have a bit of distance, and she kind of saw the depression in me, and gave me some of the space that I kind of wanted but I didn't really want at the same time.

I come out of October with a different feeling towards her. There's nothing about her or anything to do with her that has changed my mind, or my feelings. But, I'm not keen on getting to marriage with her, I don't see her living with me for the rest of my life, in the same household. How have I come to this feeling so abruptly and quickly within the space of a month? How have I managed to get this far just to back out? I have literally no clue and I feel fucking disgusting for it. I treated that girl like a literal princess throughout the year, I went through many extents to provide her with transport, money, care, and her mum loved me and always welcomed me to hang out with them at home etc. Her parents had gone through a divorce and I was there throughout the aftermath helping her and she always would ask how she would be able to repay me.

The guilt in me was literally creeping in the first days of November, whenever we would call and she would speak about our intimacy or bring up that topic of relationship/marriage. She was set for me, she wanted me. I love her, but just not that far. I'm sad with myself, she was the only one that stood by me this year and helped me through my struggles yet I can't get the feeling she feels for me and for us to be on the same page. I couldn't take it anymore. My birthday was at the start of November, and I know she's got some financial issues because of the divorce. She had saved up for a couple of months to buy me an expensive watch, and I couldn't help but tear up while I was with her. How could I take advantage of her and leave her thinking that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives, when that possibility isn't 100%. I am open to the idea, but I just can't come to accept it nor do I see it as certain as she does. She was so happy, and I care for her too much to just use her for my interest and then dump her when I'm done with her. She's worth much more than that, and I'm not that type of person to do that. But I'm still the villain here, I'm the one that's not on the same page as her, and I'm the one that'll eventually hurt her feelings and break her heart. The thought of that stinks, and I feel disgusted of myself that I'm throwing away the only thing that kept me in one piece throughout the year.

When she gave me that gift, I decided that was the moment to open up the topic and long story short she was devastated. I still remember the bench we sat on. I still remember the tears that came out of my eyes. I haven't cried like that since I was a little kid. She obviously was heartbroken and crying and questioning me as to why I had changed so abruptly. She is obviously questioning herself, that she isn't good enough, when the problem isn't with her. After talking back and forth for two hours, she was heartbroken and still not understanding how I managed to take this u-turn all of a sudden. I don't know myself, and that's kind of why I'm here. I need advice, and I don't know what to tell her.

I told her after the mood was lifted a bit to go home and speak to her mum and her sister, her closest support networks and I told her many times throughout the year for many things to turn to them because they truly are the only ones that have been there for her from when she was born. We had a bit of discussion at home over text messages and we had agreed to take a bit of a break. Right before this break, the options we had were: completely end contact and move on from each other, talk to each other as if nothing had happened and she'll try lose feelings for me in that regard (marriage), or take a break and then assess what decision to take. I told her and assured her that whatever the decision is, it has to be in her best interest because I'm the one that's broken her heart and I feel like a fucking idiot and terrible. I told her I just want her to be happy, and if that means us ending contact, then so be it. I'll live with being the loner that I was before being with her, and I guess that's what I deserve right? She agreed with taking the break and then thinking things through and also with time healing a bit. She just requested one thing from me, and that was to see what went wrong. What is the reason that I all of a sudden no longer see marriage with her. She wants a reason, and I think she deserves it and anyone in her spot deserves it. What she isn't understanding is that the problem isn't her at all, and it's with me. Today we spoke for the first time in two weeks, and she had opened up to me about the kind of insecurities she has with herself these days, questioning why she wasn't good enough for me. I just ended the phone soon as I could, and I am teary as I type this post.

She deserves answers, I don't know what to tell her. How could I explain myself? I feel disgusting with myself, was the problem from me? She said to me that she doesn't blame me and she appreciates the honesty, but that doesn't make me feel good. I've hurt this girls heart, after everything she's done for me and all she's been through. How could I explain myself to her, that I had a change of heart and how could I word this in a conversation with her? What is the reason for taking this u-turn? I need some solid advice, I'd really appreciate it through these dark times.

TL;DR - I'm a 19yo male who has felt different upon marrying the girl who loves him to death. Confronted her honestly and she wants answers as to why all of a sudden I have changed. Started questioning herself, I need advice on what to tell her. Thank you guys...",20Nov2020,1
72,"I know this is not new knowledge or anything, and I'm definitely not the first to encounter this situation.Currently pregnant. I found a job that I was really excited about.  Got an offer that was good.  First off, you aren't covered in the US by FMLA until you work somewhere for a year, so I was already facing that (meaning if you take off after birth, they can still fire you).  Fortunately this job was off during the summer, so I would have gotten 3 months off shortly after the baby either way.

I started doing some math and realized that after I account for

1. I would lose public health insurance by taking this job, and have to pay premiums to the job, and
2. I would have to pay for daycare,

My $21/hour job became a 7.50 an hour job, well below min wage here.

I feel like I don't really have the option of working, I would be netting something like 10k total in the year, while my partner makes 125k.  At that point, why bother?

It blows my mind that even for somebody with a degree doing a skilled job, I'm worth almost the same staying home as going to work.  Shouldn't the government prefer that somebody relatively unskilled be paid 12/hour to watch four children instead of skilled professionals leaving the workforce to take care of one child?

73,"Just an hypothesis:

Someone is outside from his home and makes a promise to God or Gods that he will not return to his home in order to take paper napkins. He visualised the promise in order not to make any mistakes. He visualised a specific way back home from the spot where he was and some specific paper napkins from a super market.

2 years later, that guy is in a different city. He is in the kitchen and eats a bite of cake and is ready to leave his apartment to visit his grandma. As he opens the door, he worries that he may have taken paper napkins with him without realising it. He wants to analyze the situation better and convince himself that he did not take any paper napkins. So, he randomly goes back in the kitchen to see/check some paper napkins in the table and convince himself that he never touched them. He never touched them. But, did he broke the promise while trying to find out if he ever took napkins?

- He returned to the kitchen to check/see the paper napkins.

- His promise was that he will not return to his house in order to get paper napkins.

Is the promise broken just, because he was having in his mind the paper napkins?",20Nov2020,1
74,"I am 17 years old and I've been remembering some things I did when I was 15-16, which I deeply regret and am ashamed of. Often when I was ""horny"", I made an account on platforms such as Discord and Snapchat to specifically find people who would sext with me (also minors, 13-16). I would first talk with them and then and then sometimes become a bit more sexual and ask/persuade them to send me nude pictures of themselves. If they said no I either said it's no problem or asked a few more times (I said things like come on, please, you're just really pretty/hot, etc.), but after that I stopped. Also if they sent one picture I sometimes asked for more, but never blackmailed them by threatening to send these photos to others, and always also complemented them heavily. I always deleted these pictures afterwards too. They were always complete strangers. When I did it on Discord I joined some ""dating"" servers and messaged a lot of people at once to see who would respond. On Discord I almost never sent a picture of myself, unless I somewhat trusted the other person (was only face pictures, never nude from my side). When they also asked for nude pictures I used pictures from Google (which I know is also scummy). On Snapchat I sent my face pictures more often, as it was a bit more private in terms of images. However, sometimes people saved the picture of my face (for example once I sent as said some weird and creepy texts and the other person screenshotted everything, although I am not entirely sure if I sent a picture of myself in that case). I also sometimes chatted/looked for people to sext with on random chat apps (most people there weren't minors though). The creepy messages ranged from asking if they ever did some sexual acts like oral sex and if they would do it with me, if they can send nude pictures to roleplaying that we are having sex together. I usually first had a normal conversation though, such as what their hobbies are, where they're from, etc. I did all of this quite often too (in total I think I got nude pictures from over 10 people, maybe even more). Sometimes I even pretended to be the opposite sex to find women who are homosexual (rarely though) and get sexual images from them. The nude or sexual images were sometimes in underwear and/or in suggestive poses, but sometimes completely nude and focused on the genitals.

I am also worried and anxious that if anyone I know, like family members or friends, knew what I did and would see my texts they would be disgusted at me and not want to have anything to do with me anymore.

I've found out these things are illegal when I was 16 (as it can count as child pornography, solicitation of child pornography of a minor, grooming, sending pornography to minors, etc.). Before that I thought it was fine as long as the people involved had at maximum a three year age gap. I didn't feel bad about it either. When I found out it was illegal though, it made me think more about why it might be wrong. I started feeling extremely bad and was disgusted of myself (still am). I still am also worried that I might get into legal trouble because of it, because as said it is illegal, which could fuck my life up drastically. But even if nothing of that sort happens, I'll still feel bad and disgusted about what I did, and also still a bit worried because I shared photos of my face and some people saved/screenshotted them along with my creepy texts. I have deleted almost all of my social media and have almost no online presence anymore, as it always brings up these bad memories. I also feel like a predator/pedophile, because of being horny I pretended to be interested in these people when I actually just wanted fap material. I would never do anything like that again, am very ashamed and regret it deeply.

How can I get over this, and am I terrible and disgusting for doing this (please be honest) (I know this is a confessions sub but I'd greatly appreciate any opinions or avice too)?

75,"So i recently found information online that points to my boyfriend of 3 months having a possible 5 month pregnant gf. I had this information for 2 days and waited till I saw him in person. Those 2 days I was a mess and crying nonstop. When I saw him in person and confronted him I almost found it funny and amusing watching him scramble to find a story that would make sense. Today I still find it comical thinking about his answers and I dont even feel mad at him. Idk if I am just so broken by this that I find it amusing and I dont even feel mad at him and still want him. 

Whats wrong with me and how do I fix me?",20Nov2020,1
76,"For the record, I am a girl, I find it disgusting how reddit is male dominated and the males ""seem"" to get me. I did not type this to sound edgy, I just do not like it how some random americans who know nothing about my country make assumptions and some even insult me without knowing the full situation and context, some try to help but do not help much, instead they trigger me

Warning: Bad language, personal info

With that out of the way, I will rant

I am what the americans would call a scene kid

While my country does not have many of the terms in english, I associated with the musicals and books

Here the girls are shallow and in order to be accepted you have to have straight hair, look great, full lips, big breasts, and butt and be a little dumb and only party

the men look like they have came from the prison or italian mafia - covered in tattoos,have cars, girls seem to like it, which is stupid extremely rude to girls like me who are not beautiful cause they are not fake and do not dress like a sl\*t, get shamed for not dressing like sl\*t , listening to old music such as classical or rock and getting shamed for it, since people listen to only one genre of music my age, and it is mostly sexual, cheesy and stupid. Me not listening to it makes me somehow inferior in their minds

I clearly remember ever since I was 10-11 that there were pretty and not pretty girls, the pretty girls had many friends, were never bullied, has one of those triangle bags for one arm and people like me used a backpack that was 4 years old and big so it could fit all of my notebooks and everything i need

it was popular to terrorize me daily, from calling me disgusting, crazy, weird to stalking me and even throwing objects at me.

Even if I become a sl\*t I do not think I will feel happier, in general people are not kind and I get panic attacks each time I go to a party (can't stand the lights and the sound) I am what you would call a wallflower, constantly seek to isolate my self and sit on a chair away from the stupid people who party. I mean nooo, it is not important to know where Germany is on the map or that Earth is the third planet of the Solar system, yet men/boys are dumb enough to fall for the physique for these girls despite them having the brain of a peanut.

Now I see the comments saying that I am hating on my own gender, wow, nothing new under the sun.

I do not mind their life style, it is just that it is fake, constantly going to the malls, having selfies in the toilet, etc. I do not know if I am the description of a nice girl but I no longer want to associte with people, isolation hurts me since i am lonely and i was desperate for friendship since that would mean i won't be bullied if i have someone on my side, yet people reject me for whatever strange reason.

I decide to no longer care about what they think of me and reject them on purpose since they rejected me first. no one wants me and everyone hates me and i will probably never marry and that is okay. I am just tired of being treated like shit by males who create mob mentality and use me like toy to bully me, while the good and cool males are either gay or are married to one of those dumb women

I see cool people on the street but they also look younger and feel horrible since I CAN'T go and talk to them, randomly, it will be weird and just imagine how good my life would have been if i talked to someone

it is normal for girls to rant about all kinds of stuff, yet i had no one in my life. I hate that.

I want to go out of my country but the west won't accept my diploma and I will be humiliated and probably made to peel potatoes and not have a good job. I sometimes wish I just had a normal life and not write on reddit to a bunch of strangers who seem to get me when in reality they make me more sad (some comments on reddit trigger me so much that I cry and try not to s\*\*\* harm because it reminds me of something horrible from my past) I hate how everyone says that I am not alone and it will get better, no it will f\*\*\*ing not! I am already s\*\*\*idal and do not know how long I will live. I want to succeed to show my bullies even though they don't care about me, if I don't succeed I will probably do something stupid and drastic.

84,"Stepdad (50sM) came home from a business trip on Friday of last week— 7 days ago— with a cough. By Sunday I (18F) had noticed his cough and on the way to our church, he goes “I feel awful” to which I replied “maybe you should get tested for covid” only for him to reply “no I feel excellent!” (What???) He, with no mask on, sits next to a high risk man with a strew of health problems. Then he stays after church to eat with everyone, KNOWING he is sick. “It’s just a cold” he keeps saying. We all pressured him to get tested so he went. Wednesday my mom (40sF) loses her voice, grandma (70sF) is also coughing. Thursday, his test comes back positive. Today, I wake up with awful body aches and headache. Rush to my doctor for a rapid test and what do ya know! I’m covid positive. Everyone in my house except my boyfriend who rents a room from my parents is showing symptoms, including my grandparents who live a few houses down. 

Angry because my stepdad doesn’t wear masks and wipes his toothbrush off on a shared hand towel in the bathroom. Because he thinks the virus is a hoax and that the flu kills more. Because all my life I’ve been dealing with health problems and he’s watched me turn into a shell of what I once was because I can’t do anything without getting sick. Because this is the 10th time this year I’ve gotten sick with either a flu or a severe cold or a virus. Because he’s watched my mom carry me into the hospital while my oxygen is below 90% too many times. Because he still has no regard for my health. 

Terrified because simply remembering how it feels for my chest to get tight and heavy sends me into a panic. Because I don’t want to keep going through this. Because I just want to be normal and contribute to society without getting sick, and yet here I am, sick again with a whole new illness. 

I’m so scared of being hospitalized again. I’m so scared of not making it this time. I’m so scared of more debilitating pain.

I hate being told that it will be okay, that I’m “strong”. I’m already barely contributing to this life. I’m too young to be such a waste of space and resources. I’m not okay knowing I’m just a burden to society and I’m only a quarter of the way through my life. 

I wonder who I’ll lose to this illness or if it’ll take me out.",20Nov2020,1
87,"Since I met him about 7 years ago i always liked him a lot, 
since the first moment I saw him i fell in love with his existence. His name is Alejandro (I don't mind saying his name, he doesn't have Reddit) he is 25 years old (me, 26) white skin slightly pearly, is a little taller than me and has a certain green hue in the eyes that are honey colored, and although he does not have a body of a super european model, for me, his physical complexion is perfect. I met him through some neighbor/mutual friends who lived near my parents' house, we were never great friends but we didn't hate each other, we got along well. he's not openly homosexual like me, but although he denied it, it is well known that he is bisexual and even in meetings at the homes of those ex- neighbors/mutual friends he and I a few times stare at each other discreetly like flirting, or at least that's what it seemed to be.
I always had a hope that he would notice me. For a little over a year I had not had the opportunity to see him and now much less for everything that has happened due to the pandemic until last night. Surprisingly he sent me a message on WhatsApp, this excited me a lot but in the messages I tried not to make it notice too much. 
We started talking and he proposed to meet me somewhere to have some alcohol together and talk since he wanted to go out with someone and his close friends weren't available. So he thought of me. I obviously accepted and I proposed him that we could be at my house, but he did not want to be locked in some house, he wanted to go out. The bars in our city are open but neither he nor I wanted to go to one. There are restrictions due to the pandemic, it is not like before and 
we really don't feel too comfortable being in a bar under these new conditions. So I proposed to him that I would pass for him in my car, we would buy some alcoholic drinks and we would go to a street that is on a hill and from where a large part of our city can be seen from a panoramic view. Alejandro accepted and we did what we agree. After a long time being parked on that street talking and drinking inside the car, the following happened. A = Alejandro. M = Me.

M: ...and what the girlfiend says, bro. 

A: haha which? since we stopped getting together with 'mutual friends' I broke up with 'girl', since then i'm single.

M: what? 'girl' was your girlfriend? I didn't know that. 

A: yeah, and since then i haven't kissed anyone. - finished  telling me this when he was looking into my eyes, for which I got nervous, I smiled and looked away towards the city.

M: Oh.. I'm sure you'll soon find someone to do it.

Axel similed and seconds after finishing his beer, said:
and what about you? boyfriend?.

By this time I was already quite nervous and excited because I saw where our conversation was going.

M: No, I've never done that shit haha - I told him while I was lighting a cigarette - I like someone but I don't think he corresponds to me, it's worth dreaming.

A: You never know, everything can happen. what is his name? have I met him?.

I couldn't get any more with the excitement, for me the atmosphere really felt tense. I steeled myself, looked at him and said:

M: I really like you a lot, it's you who I'm talking about. 

Alejandro was silent for a few eternal seconds until he nervously laughed and said: To be a joke, it's a little over-trusted, ¿don't you think?.

When he said this immediately all the emotion that I felt disappeared and was replaced by shame, a lot of nervousness, a strange feeling of defeat and a certain fear for how Alejandro would react now that he knew how I felt about him.

M: I'm sorry, but it's not a joke... it's true. Sorry if I offended you, I should never have told you that... Calm down, Alejandro, I know that you are not gay ( He is bisexual, but i was not going to question his sexuality, it was not the right thing to do and it would only make things worse ) and I will not force you to do anything that you don't want. I will understand if you no longer want to see me after this, If you want, I'll leave you at home. 

Alejandro remained silent watching me, clearly surprised. 
I grabbed the car keys and was ready to turn it on, when Alejandro said: No, just wait a second... I am not mad at you. Surprised not so much, I already saw it coming. ¿you know?. I like men, too. But I don't like to say it openly, and you don't even think about telling others because otherwise... 

Hearing this instantly I was already excited again but trying to stay as calm as possible. 

M: No! Of course no! I would never say it if you don't want to, I swear to god. If one day you need support regarding that issue or whatever you want, be sure that you can count on me because sometimes... 

At that moment what I had dreamed of for years finally really happened which filled my heart with immeasurable happiness: ALEJANDRO KISSED ME! A quickly grabbed me by the head, made me approached him and we started kissing at the same time that we touched a little but not so sexually. His kisses were soft and affectionate but at the same time so full of passion. What I felt at that moment was something difficult to describe but really exciting beyond words. 

After about 4 minutes kissing each other, we move off, and we smile and laugh with a little nervousness.

A: That feeling is mutual, i also like you. You're handsome.

M: Thank you, so are you and a lot.

A: but at the moment I am not looking to be in a relationship and less with a man. 

I really did not expect that at that exact moment we would become boyfriends. LOL.

M: it's okay, bro. I'm also not looking to be in a relationship right now... ¿friends?.

A: Yeah, friends.",20Nov2020,1

107,"This is my first time posting, I don't normally post in any subreddits, but after a conversation with my fiancé I felt like I wanted to share! This is an explanation of my experience and an expression of some of my thoughts as they pertain! 

Some context: I'm a 24 year old who graduated college,  I tried grad school for a little bit and withdrew after a year and some change. After withdrawing, I found a job as a Claims Adjuster Trainee with Progressive. 

So like the title and context states, I'm a young guy who is starting his first real job. I've never really known anything but school.I've always worked, I had jobs all throughout college. Work was always a tertiary thought and really in the periphery of my mind. It was always something I just had to survive so i could get back to my studies. I graduated in the summer of 2019 with a degree in exercise science and a minor in philosophy. In the fall of 2019 I went straight to grad school in orthotics and prosthetics.  O&amp;P school is extremely tough. I made it through the first year doing okay, but with COVID-19 ravaging universities, and everything else, I did not adapt well to online learning. My mental health plummeted, I put on a ton of weight, I was puking from anxiety and made the tough decision to drop out. I didn't wait long to start searching for jobs because I have a fiancé to help support, and in no way would I leave the burden of supporting us totally to her. I withdrew in September and that day I started applying for jobs,  fast forward a month and a half I got the Progressive job as a claims adjuster.  A decent salary (or so I felt) with pretty nice benefits. I started on Monday and this has been a tough transition. Just being at work from 8:30-5:30 has been tough. Going from being unemployed and depressed to that kind of structure has already felt like a challenge. Being present and engaged while working home has been a unique struggle as well. Having never done any insurance anything to participating in a 3 week training course has been really strenuous. I did not realize the anxiety that comes with wanting to do this job well, and learn everything on the spot. Then simply trying to figure out what I do with myself after work. It all feels so overwhelming, and I'm trying very hard to be gentle with myself, and give myself credit for how far I've come and the work I've done to get here.

Not lost to time

Still the same man in this game

Victim of a questionable crime

To be seen in the context of comfort

With time, nothing but the still beating heart of rhyme

The me you have grown to know living ferociously

The one to kindly calm and kindle flames

Our hearts devoured emotions with their ways

Still to myself never imagining to see

The ways I had heard to feel you

I am not here to steal you

These are things I see in the real you

Not an image or a statement

This is not a living question

We hear ourselves under the masks and faces

We hear our thoughts shine through though unspoken

Only known to the darkest of places

Awake and alive if ever unbroken

This blood awakened by the night

Coursing through veins once held by the cold

We return home if called by such a name

This is a fantasy turned to real life alive

Begging inside to be heard

Trembling messages of hope and dreams

I will exist beside you

With no expectation

Nothing denied you

I am here and reaching for the answer to my own

I will say once more that we roam

We will find our place

Within this spinning world we truly call home",20Nov2020,1

I’ve had to let go of dreams and goals; of relationships; of ideas about how my future would look like; of things I believed are what I want and need; of ideas about who I am supposed to be, where am I supposed to be, and with whom (or who? idk) I am supposed to be. It’s been really tough to battle thoughts of self-pity, self-hate, self-blame, and belittling my own achievements. I’m proud that I am in a much better place than I was half a year ago, but damn, this string seems to never end.
