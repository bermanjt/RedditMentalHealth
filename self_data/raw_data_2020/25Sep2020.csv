2,"I don't feel invested in reality at this point in life. I feel like everything can be deconstructed psychologically, and even though it's not always an emotionally healthy idea, my brain seems to do it naturally. Instead of thinking of myself as a Person, I consider myself to be occupying a genetic vessel as a member of the species, Humans. All of our desires/ambitions can be explained as a biological desire to climb a primal dominance hierarchy, yet all of our failings can be considered either the result of insufficient genetic qualities or damage inflicted on naturally open wounds as part of the species. It's a very strange mindstate to be in but it seems to be persistent, too. There's both liberation and pain to thinking in this way. Anyway sorry for the ramble.",25Sep2020,1

Hey guys. I’m coming to this community because in the past I’ve experience such kindness from you all. I made a post a little while ago because I was in a bad place, and I was worried my father in law had COVID-19. 

Well it’s official. My father in law has COVID-19. His condition has gotten progressively worse over the past couple of days. 

He was doing ok at home beforehand, but now he’s been moved to the hospital. I don’t get to see him because of the restrictions around hospitals due to the virus, so I can’t even talk to him. My girlfriend has seen him, and she says he looks really sick, but is keeping a smile on his face the whole time. 

Has anyone else here had any older/weaker relatives get Covid? Are there any success stories of them recovering?

I’m at home now, and I’ve been so upset all day, I’m just terrified we are going to lose him. Continuing to try and find a job has been keeping my mind off it during the day, but at night I just get lost in a pit of bad thoughts. I’m hungry, and worried, and broke, and scared. This has been one of my toughest covid months yet. 

I’ve been jobless for a while now, since we went into lockdown, and my savings are gone, but being broke and hungry is the least of my worries now. I just hope I can get a job soon so I can help my girlfriends family out, because right now I can’t even support myself. I feel like I’m drowning in debt and worries. 

I don’t know why I’m writing this all out, I guess I just need reassurance that it’ll be ok

Thank you guys for listening",25Sep2020,1
6,"Yesterday I made the decision with my neurologist to finally go to therapy the second time (actually third, first one was just a few days cause it didn't work out).



I was visiting her like at least once a month and during our last few meetings, we didn't really make any progress.



I am studying right now and it puts me under a lot of stress.
Being 25 myself, I feel like people expect me to finally get a job or finish studying, but I just can't.



I have underlying mental and physical issues and my neurologist made it really clear that I will most likely only harm myself if I continue the current path.


I am having suicidal thoughts once again because I barely make progress for years and a lot of stuff from the past comes up and makes me emotionally instable.



All my life I've never really felt like I found my own place and I hope this therapy will help me with that.



In my first therapy, the main focus was on my Social Anxiety and borderline tendencies, now it will be cause of Depression, Generalized Anxiety Disorder + OCD, and most likely AD(H)S.




My neurologist also said she would give me a letter for my university, so that I can pause studying right now, but only if I accept therapy, which I did.





Honestly, this might all put me in a lot of trouble, since I'll probably be 27 or 28 once I finally will be able to pursue a real career.


But then again, I barely have alternatives. I'm feeling wonderful one day, anxious and sad the next, it's all unstable.



This will cost me and my family a lot of patience, money and time, but I feel like right now this is the best I can do.



Studying haunts me day and night, I have so much stuff to do, so much exams to repeat because I failed tremendously.



Hopefully now my life will get better.",25Sep2020,1

9,"I had an emergency brain MRI with contrast because the neurologist thinks I am leaking brain fluid out of my spine. My spine's burst open basically, and this has led to me being disabled for years. I tried very hard to get doctors to see me and do this type of scan.

So I had the scan on the 22nd, and I requested to get a copy of the MRI images so I could see them. They told me they'd send a letter where I have to sign it, I thought ''okay simple enough''.

A letter came earlier today, and it's a fucking joke. A literal fucking joke. It asked me to give away my driver's license (I don't drive because this condition affects my fucking eyes), my birth certificate, my passport (I haven't flown in 10 years because it's dangerous for me), and a letter from the hospital. I have a letter from the hospital to my address but they're asking for two. I have to give up my birth certificate, passport or driver's license permanently just to see some pictures. What the actual fuck..

So I'll never get the fucking MRI images and here I was thinking I wouldn't be disappointed for the first time in my life. I felt like ripping up the letter so badly I had to give them to a friend.",25Sep2020,1

30,"So a little bit of information before I start is I am a quadriplegic which means I’m disabled and in a wheelchair. My disability is Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita (https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/arthrogryposis). Basically my joints are backwards and I have little to no muscle in my arms and legs. Here’s a link explaining a little more in depth of what it is and how it affects me. 

So I am a senior in high school and I really cannot decide what option to do after high school. I really want to do YouTube after high school but I feel like college could be a huge risk financial wise(i’ll explain a little more later on). 

Now the reason why I really want to do YouTube is because I feel like it would be a pretty smart job choice. The reason why I think it would be a pretty smart job choice is because it is something I would be able to do and something I already know how to do. I already am really good with computers, I’m pretty good at video games. I’ve had a lot of people say that I have a good mentality to be a YouTuber, and it’s something that I would would enjoy and be passionate about. I also feel like there is a niche for disabled Youtubers. If you think about it how many disabled Youtubers could you name or automatically find their name on YouTube. Personally I only know 2 Youtubers that are disabled that upload pretty frequently. I’m not saying that it would be easy to get a lot of subscribers and views, but I feel like I could attract the disabled side of the community. As well as, the gaming side of the community, and people that are just interested in the video. 

Now on the college side of things, I feel like it would be a huge financial risk and personally feel like college is not for me at this point in time. I feel that I would have a huge disadvantage later on after college getting a job. The reason why I feel like I would have trouble for example, I could have a masters degree and apply for a job and someone else could apply for the same job but have a bachelors degree. The person with the bachelors degree could get hired over me because he’s not disabled, And would not need any more assistance for that job. What I mean by that is the company would not have to hire someone else to help that person but they would for me if they were to hire me. By the way it’s illegal to not hire someone for a job because they are disabled. Even though it’s illegal to not hire someone because of their disability, they could just say “ sorry you don’t have the qualities that we are looking for”. It’s sad but I actually know someone that this is happened to them before but there was nothing they could do about it. 

Sorry for this being a long post but I really need some other peoples opinion on this and I feel like read it what is the best way to go!",25Sep2020,1

34,"My subconscious is telling me that I may have made a rushed promise to God, 3 years ago, about not sticking gum or pieces of booger below my home office desk. I cant remember making the promise but the last months, I get bad feelings coming from my home office desk.

2 days ago, I picked my nose and had some pieces of booger stuck in my fingers. I was very careful not to stick them accidentally, on my desk and break the hypothetical promise.

Suddenly, for some seconds, I forgot about the last piece of booger that was on my finger and made a rush gesture with my hand. There is a chance that my desk may have touched the small piece of booger but without the piece of booger getting stuck on the desk.

I worry if I accidentally, broke the hypothetical promise to God just, because I forgot the booger on my finger. I did not plan to stick it. Accidentally, i made a gesture that may have made my booger touch for a second, my desk. I am not sure.

Does that break the promise? I am angry and tired. I was being too careful and afraid about it and for some seconds, I forgot about it.

I am angry with myself because I cant remember the promise but yet, I get bad feelings from the desk as if I may have made one in the past and forgot it. I cant remember.

If in case i made a promise is it valid? I am afraid because I may have asked for punishment in case breaking it. Is the promise still valid? Can I blame my ocd? Why would I threaten myself in order to stop doing a bad habit (sticking gum and booger below my desk) that is easy to stop WITHOUT the fear of the promise and the punishment. I am angry with myself if I made a promise. I am angry with myself for not remember it. I am angry with myself for getting bad feelings coming from my desk.

41,"CW brief mention of suicide

I attempted suicide 3 years ago today. I barely even thought about it. But I do tend to feel suicidal in September.

Today I found out my EEG (epilepsy test) was normal. I don’t know if I actually have epilepsy or not.

I chose not to go on medication because I won’t be able to afford it, and my symptoms weren’t that serious. And, I think I accidentally faked it. I managed to fake an allergy of all things earlier this year.

It’s not that I *wanted* to fake anything, it’s that it just...happened. I tend to freak out over my health. I can’t tell what’s real and what’s not.

So I wasted a lot of money...at least from my perspective. Maybe I should be glad that I made sure to get tests done, to rule out conditions. But I have bills that are just sitting there because I can’t pay them.

I wish I spent the money on a psychiatrist instead.

I don’t have a job either. I’ve never had one, and I don’t have the motivation to get one. I can barely get anything done. It’s a wonder I managed to even slightly clean my room yesterday.

I’m almost 20.

I told him he was welcome to do it if he really wanted (I have nudes posted elsewhere, and the pictures in question don’t easily identify me), but that it likely wouldn’t go the way he thinks. He chose not to post them. I think that means deep down he agrees with me.

52,"I met my partner at work when I was 24 years old, I had and still have a stable job and the only reason he makes more money than me is that he has more experience in the field.

We just clicked. I had never imagined committing myself to someone who is just a few years younger than my parents (actually I wasn't keen on committing myself at all before), but I feel we are just meant to be. 
After 4 years relationship, 2 years of living together, 2 cats, a pandemic which led to being stuck with each other 24/7 for 3 months in our tiny apartment I know he's the one. In this case age really is just a number. I am happy. My parents love him because they see how happy we are, my friends love him because he's smart, witty and kind-hearted. 
About a week ago, he got down on one knee and I said yes. We'll get married in June and I am sooo excited.

53,"So I don’t need to explain to y’all the amount of stress I’m under just considering 1) Covid and 2) I live in the US. 

I’m a grad student in Egyptology pursuing my Master’s and like...wow it feels so fucking pointless right now. Like why should I be doing research on fucking scarabs when there are riots in the street for justice and our entire govt system is collapsing around us? Even without the civil unrest, COVID is enough to make me feel like a useless piece of shit. I love what I’m studying but I’m so depressed I can barely do work. My work ethic has been keeping me afloat just barely. I don’t know how long it will continue. Who knows how long COVID and the US shit show will continue - much longer than my degree I can tell you that. I’m supposed to finish by May. 

I just feel like I could be doing something more important. But I only have a BA in history and so that’s basically useless without further degrees. I want to stay living in the city I am which is not my hometown, but the only reason I live here is because of school. School is all I have. Or at least, it used to be. 

Even without the concern of my degree being useful or not, trying to get into academia was fucked before and is super fucked now. It would take a literal miracle for any one person to get a job in it right now, and that applies to everyone from the best minds to the worst. So the compounding environmental factors are severely exacerbating the anxiety I already had about my future. 

I just want to live in a place that supports me, where I don’t have to be constantly worried about my finances, where I work doing something I like (not even love because that’s unlikely), have a family. I’m not opposed to challenges and hardships I’m just so TIRED. I’m privileged and I’m tired so I can’t imagine how everyone else feels. I just don’t know what to do. Do I keep following my plan and pursue that doctorate, do I call it quits after my MA, or do I drop out? Does it even matter? 

Note: I mention the state of the US because it is chaotic and toxic as fuck and I really don’t want people debating about that in the comments. I mentioned it because it’s sincerely stressing me the fuck out, not to argue about it.",25Sep2020,1

55,"I keep my social media very limited to people I was great friends with, mostly in high school and later in life.

I came across the sister of my friend under my friend suggestions. I got curious and checked out her profile. Within the last 3 years, her father got cancer (and is remission), her mother (who I remember as being extremely kind and happy) passed away, and the hardest news for me: her brother, an old childhood pal, at 26 years old, got an aggressive form of stomach cancer and passed within a few months of diagnosis. What the hell, life?

My old friend posted some updates on his profile, and they were quite horrible to go back and read. The decline from hope to fear was evident. He was in his final year of school for software engineering, something I’ve wanted to do for so long, but never had the means.

He was one of my only friends at the time. He was one of the only kids to include me in his activities, like playing lego and playing with dinosaurs (I remember going to buy some from the store, so excited to play with him). I always remember him as being hilarious and creative, qualities his sister mentioned that he kept with him for his entire life.

I don’t know why I am so sad about this, we haven’t spoken in many years. Something about the fragility and unfairness of life coming together in such an intense way, to such a young, kind soul is hard to bear. Maybe it’s something to do with the fact that I can count on two hands how many people have impacted my life the way he has, by being kind enough to socialize with the overly shy kid who many overlook. Maybe it’s also something to do with the loss of what could have been - how I wish that I kept in touch with him, as it seems we would have had a lot in common.

59,"There is no simple key to life.

But there are stones you can set for yourself, things you can do everyday.

And I promise, I promise, with all honesty and love, that this works if you're consistent, and life has potential, so do not give it up.

Here goes:

 •Be Kind. I cannot stress this enough. A little girl smiled at me today when I thought she was eyeing me. That little girl made my day. She gave me the most beautiful laugh. The other day a friend called me and asked me if I was okay. It was one of the worst nights of my life. I cried my eyes out on the phone, which I never do, and that person will forever be a treasure to me.

•Get Out of Your Comfort Zone. EVERY SINGLE DAY. Whether that means going out, walking alone, calling a friend, texting someone, talking about your feelings, share those pictures, hug your mother, kiss your siblings, whatever the heck it is. I cannot promise you there won't be disappointing days, but you should never give up.

•Memory Lane. We all have our horrible moments. Memories we want to erase. Memories that play on repeat when we're trying to fall asleep. My suggestion? Make a box of small pieces of paper, each piece containing a memory that you cherish. That one time you went out on a spontaneous trip, that ice-cream from a friend, that comment from your dad, that hug that lasted forever, that girls night, that boys night, that butterfly moment you got, the smell of fresh cut grass, that colorful milky way. WRITE IT DOWN. READ IT WHEN YOY FEEL LIKE THE WORLD IS CRASHING DOWN ON YOU.

•Love Others. Be there for them. Tell them why you appreciate them. Share your thoughts. Be honest, but also be real. Stop living in the world where overthinking is the golden rule and overanalyzing stuff becomes the holy grail. People appreciate the small things. Tell them how you really feel, share the love, and yes, you might be turned down (even in a friendship or from a parent) but you have at least done yourself right. You let it out. Because our downfall one day will be that excessive amount of emotions we choose not to share with others.

•Ignite Your Passions. I can't stress this enough. Work on you, and your personality. Not the money, not the people around you and the amount of friends you have. Do what you truly love, and do it everyday. Sports? Stop slacking off and do what inspires you. Music? Play for 15 minutes a day, trust me. You have the time. Writing? Read a bit everyday. Learn new words. Use them. Make scribbles, a writing book, write vocab. Do not be embarrassed if you have to learn something from scratch.

Yo. You. Reading this. You're awesome and I can't stress this enough. Everyone goes through something, but it doesn't stop there. 
Yes. It took you a month, 3 months, a year, 10 years, even 30 years to stop the self destruction and hatred. Doesn't matter. You have learned so much from what you've been through. You've learned compassion and empathy. You have the power to share your story and inspire.

Please never give up, because I believe in you.",25Sep2020,1

63,"Covid has gifted me tons of downtime. I used to work 30-40 hours a week, but nowadays its only 12 because of the virus affecting our business. My partner however, still works their salaried job full time from home. Due to annoying circumstances also caused by Covid, we do not see each other in person for roughly 6-7 weeks at a time. These factors have coalesced in a way that has me all fucked up.

I miss my partner so much, but they are so busy. I just want some affection or to feel loved or anything, but going to VM call after call or getting the increasingly common ""i'll respond to this later"" text has left me feeling like a burden. I respectfully brought up how I was feeling twice within the last 10 days. The first time, my partner appeared receptive. The second time, they said they wished they could just focus on work more. It was heart breaking. My partner confirmed I was, at least in some small way, a burden.

And this is all so confusing because I thought our relationship was rock-solid, just 5 weeks ago we were on a wonderful vacation together. I am not sure how to interpret all of this. My partner, hasn't been in any serious relationships in their adult life, so perhaps their behavior comes from inexperience, but I have been in many relationships in my adult life and I've been in some where this sort of behavior could be subtext for ""leave me alone.""

And here I am, venting to strangers online instead of telling them all this because I just went to voicemail, yet again. FML.",25Sep2020,1
64,"Hello there,

If you're newly telepathic like I was once, then you probably need some advice. Is it real? Yes, it's very real, but should you believe it? Not really. Telepathy is mostly a sham. And you should probably get rid of it, right? Well - maybe not.

If you enjoy set and looking at head premiere's then telepathy is for you, just beware of the boats. So what is Set? Another joke, it's just a love sign basically, some believe it to be a personality that allows for mind control. After talking with someone's subconscious you can get it to respond with certain words and phrases.

This ""sets"" you to do what they say. While actual mind control techniques exists, set is not one of them. It's real at times to those who believe it to be real and maybe to those who don't understand that it's not real. But for those who have it explained to them that it's not real - then not doesn't work.

And here's why it doesn't work because it's just a love sign to show people who you love and to show people who've you.

So which secret society should you join?

The Bohemian Club? The Skull and Bones? The Hell at the Gates? The illuminati?

Well you should join none of them.

Because they're all evil and about one thing. Taking or putting kids in elephant suits. Sometimes, they're about Set and sometimes they're about ""governing time"" but in actuality?

They're disgusting. Never be a telepathic member either or they'll control your life. They're evil as shit. Just pick your favorite, mine was the Bohemian Club (or the Bohemian Grove as they called themselves to me) and the guy in charge of them ""codenamed Billy"" just made funny remarks to me and I just so happened to like curses a lot because of James A. Garfield who told me telepathically that he had started the Bohemian Club through time.

They also believe in giving this children who have been in elephant suits sex just to heal them with research coming from the 1800's. Suggesting that it helps these children cope with their ordeal when it truly never did for me either.

I never got into it, and was just a telepathic member.

So in the end? Take an anti telepathy drug if they actually do exist. Or maybe use a head premiere to take it all away.

There are also words to erase people's minds which do not work. People ""have to be vollosable"" in certain societies, and I've tried to retrain myself for vollos but those words never work anyways.",25Sep2020,1
65,"She was everyone’s favorite, even the teacher’s favorite and she was really active in the community and everyone loved her. So she got cancer last year and when she told us as a class we were all over the place. Like up and down the hallways sobbing, now that I think about it, that probably was the most dramatic Oscar worthy day ever in school history. But she died recently and the school told us. We knew three days before cuz her children were saying that she died, three days before she died??????? But I think the school counselor expected us to be super super sad and another Oscar eighth cry fest but we were all stony faced and went back to work right after. And now I feel like we looked like little assholes cuz we already had time to process and someone who didn’t know we knew told us that our favorite teacher was dead. So the whole thing was really really awkward and then like the counselor said we could come talk to her but like none of us did and we all had the same idea to go to the bathrooms and just revaluate the entire thing. And then all the sixth graders took up all the bathroom stalls and started to make TikToks. So us plus the sixth graders they’re were 20 girls in the bathroom and there’s only supposed to be three cuz or Rona and the janitor looked into the bathroom and saw like four of us so he was gonna go tell the principal. So we all tried to walk back to class really quick except the sixth graders cuz they claim they don’t care about authority and they don’t care about getting in trouble. But then a teacher came out her classroom when we were rushing back to class and we got in trouble for being in the bathroom, talking in the hallway,  being with the sixth graders, not being in class, talking about our dead teacher, and not going to the counselors office for them to tell me how great a person my teacher was. And then the rest of my teachers for the rest of the day just gave long awkward speeches to us. It’s been a wild day, and idk how to process it.",25Sep2020,1
66,"You know,I used to think that suicide would actually be a great idea...why live when the country/world is shit(ESPECIALLY if you are a POC,LGBT,Liberal,etc.)? Wouldn't a bullet to the skull solve everything?  


Turns out,no,it wouldn't.  


In fact,it takes a certain amount of bravery to take your own life.  


And death..death is fucking scary..why the hell would you want to die,when you really have no idea if life will get worse/remain shit? No one has clairvoyance/a crystal ball..NO ONE can predict the future..  


How the hell is suicide a way to go? All you'll be is dead and that's it.  


You can never take back death.  


Death happens to everyone,but I'd rather die like my dad:Living a long life and dying of natural causes rather than putting a bullet in my head.  


Why do people think going to oblivion is the better answer than trying to survive?  


I mean,unless you have a terminal illness,99% of things in life have some kind of solution.  


And While I am personally afraid of the country turning into a dictatorship and going all open season on POCs like me,I don't know if that'll happen for real..I don't know if it'll even be that bad.  


But yet,my mind wants me to think that way.  


I hate my fucking brain.  


Fuck suicide...sure I might have said I want to take myself out,but the truth is I don't wanna die and I have NO idea if things will stay as the hellish nightmare that it is.  


I just don't know.  


But I know for a fact that suicide will do nothing for me except put me in the ground.  


Fuck that.  


TL;DR:Suicide is just not the answer:All it is is your mind feeding you one billion kinds of bullshit and no one knows if things will well and truly get fucked up. No one knows anything but the present.",25Sep2020,1
67,"We had an argument last night, I thought she was saying something bad about me to other people because one of my friends who hates her told me, and so I confronted her about it and once I found it wasn’t true my anxiety rose and I couldn’t control myself, I felt like I just lost a friend over nothing I hate fighting with my best friend cause usually it just ends with pain. 

Listen I’m insecure about something, basically today, I saw her @ a guy i know I follow on Instagram and when I realized it she has a new guy friend now, it brought a tear to my eyes because some of the stuff we said to each other last night was painful and there’s this one thing she said that I was just toxic but i wasn’t and I was the only one there for her when people were saying something bad about her. not only that she even called her other best friend toxic too and We’ve been there for her for a long time since day 1. I don’t get it, the thing I’m insecure about is whenever I feel like I see someone who seems to be more superior and with more clout I guess and I’m just here feeling inferior and I try to get out of the mindset all the time. 

Tonight I’m supposed to talk to her and figure this stuff out cause I really care about her I really do I hate how she’s acting now and I only want to save her cause I feel like she’s turning into a bad person cause of what these toxic people have done to her.",25Sep2020,1

69,So my roomates and I are having a girls night and we ordered a pizza. At first I suggested we all just get our own slices because they are big and I like to add my own toppings to it. I suggested this so that everyone could add whatever they like to their pizza. So then one of my roomates just didn't want to compromise. She's like no just get a cheese pie we'll share it. So then I suggest get it half cheese and the other half toppings cuz damn it if I'm paying for everyone's food I want to be satisfied with what I eat. And then she's like just get cheese and then she was like let's all get the same soda too. Now before you start calling me a bitch I'm not crying over the pizza. I'm annoyed because they never listen to me or care about my opinions or feelings. Even when we were choosing a movie they had no care for what I suggested. They are always the one choosing what we do and I never have a say they don't give a damn about my opinions. They never let me choose what we get to do or watch and it's irritating. I really don't want to hear anyone saying I'm bitching about pizza because I'm not. Imagine everyone ignoring what you say and never let you have a choice in what you do and then when you stop giving suggestions they think you're a bitch like no you put me in that position,25Sep2020,1
70,"After high-school, I studied in college for 2 years to become an HVAC technician. I got a job and worked for almost a year as a technician. The money was amazing but the work was insane. Over 50 hours a week, I was sad, had no social life, weekends were my only time off and when it hit Sunday, I was depressed that work on Monday is so soon I would not be happy again for the rest of the week. We got our paychecks every week so the money was amazing but I was not happy at all. When you work in hvac, the only way up to the top is owning your own business and that's just not me. I dont want to own a business. Its very stressful from what I see in my company. The labor on your body takes such a toll. Last month I was up to my limits and I quit on the spot respectfully to my company. I wanted to do something that made me happy. Not some random future I decided after high-school because I heard the money is good. I wanted to become an artist even though I had no experience. I had so much money I bought a tablet with a screen to draw on, plugged to my computer. I was happy drawing and I wanted this to be my future. Im taking a part time job now because I do need some sort of income. But I have so much time to do art and I'm happy. Anyone have any similar experience or advice?",25Sep2020,1
71,Saw the video of that man in OKC that got tazerd 53 times. I just can't man.  Jared Lakey was his name I believe. Apparently had an underlying medical condition that made him act the way he did and instead just arrest him and get him medical help they just essentially tortured him. Dude was naked he had no weapons and wasn't even that big of a man. It made me sad how lazy law enforcement was that they felt that had to taze him that much instead of just going hands on and just putting his hands behind his back and putting him in the car. They claim he was on drugs but of course toxicology came back negative for anything.,25Sep2020,1
72,"I am a male college student with a lot of social opportunities and am consistently meeting new people. However, I struggle to actually make meaningful conversation or connections with people. And truthfully it's not really that I'm shy, it's just that I have no idea what to say. 

In a situation where I have something specific to talk about or someone asks me something, I can talk relatively easily and comfortably and it's not much of a problem. But say I'm in an environment where it's just a bunch of new people in a room... I have no idea what to do. 

And it's not really even a thing where I freeze up in the moment. Like I'm currently thinking about a hypothetical situation where I'm talking to someone, but I literally have no idea what I would say, even if I try to brainstorm before. If I have something in mind to talk about with a specific person I have no problem talking about it, but finding something to talk about is the biggest issue. 

Just need some advice or something to get me going before I waste the last two years of college being the same as I always have been instead of growing.",25Sep2020,1
73,"I tried to fight it, finding someone but after many failures (too many tho). I realized some facts about myself :

1. I am simply boring, well since I never had interest into stuff people consider trendy.

2. I am weirdo magnet,due my high weirdness resistance thresholdold, girls/women with issues flock to me like mosquitoes to sweaty pig

3. About sweating my genes gifted me to put simply generous amount of bodyhair, wich increased my sweating problem (I really hate summer) and give me stench that is hard to get rid of. Bathing 2 times at day ia must be for me.

4. No matter what I, do , hear only one phrase about how good man I am and how surely will find love
