I know interesting news or interactions in entertainment, news, sports, etc usually create discussions, and because of corona there's much less of that. But I thought that because of quarantine and staying home, reddit and social media would be more active just because people post or frequent out of boredom. Instead it seems like the opposite.

**Message me to join our secret mastermind group**

Hey guys,

We are trying to have a holistic understanding of Game. We want to target everything that is going to help you become a high-value guy from fashion to nutrition to online behaviors. I see a lot of you making these MASSIVE mistakes, which are **turning you into low-value guys**. Hopefully, these tips serve as a course-correcting for you guys to become high-value guys. Unfortunately, a lot of people who give free advice out there give it without an adequate context. Therefore, one can misunderstand their information.

In this post, I will go more in-depth on flaking. I plan on writing a three-part guide. Flaking 101, Flaking 202, and Flaking 301. This week we will talk about how to decrease flaking substantially.

**1- Mass Number Collect**

""Game is a Numbers Game,"" everyone who has done the Game will tell you this statement. I believe the statement is correct. You have to have a large pool of leads. For instance, try to get 100 phone numbers instead of 20.

**Rationale**: You will encounter girls who flake on you for no reason. For instance, if she has a bad day. If she argues with her parents if she gets invited to a party. You should expect most girls to flake, and then the small pool that doesn't flake can be turned in to are your leads to move things forward.

**2-Make sure you hit up your numbers the same day or the next day**

You need to make an impact on her and then move things forward. Once the initial approach ends the time before the Day 2 acts as a time bridge for you guys to meet up again. If you wait too long, then she'll forget about you.

**Rationale:** Hot Girls get approached all the time. Hot girls do not find it unique a guy came over and chatted with them. Most Girls get invited to festivals, concerts, raves, and trips. You need to understand that fact both so you don't pedestalize the girl and second, so you strike while the iron is hot.

**3-Push for a meeting that same week**

For instance, if I approach a cute girl on a Tuesday, then I will try to meet her on Thursday or Friday. I won't wait for the following week or even next week. Waiting too long to meet her exponentially decreases my chances of meeting her.

**Rationale**: Very similar to #2. You want to text her on Tuesday and meet her on Thursday. I see many of you texting her for months and not making a move. You need to make your move since hot girls of both abundance and distractions. For instance, her friend is coming later the week, then she'll forget all about you.

**4- Use the concrete language of places, venues and times**

**Sample**\[Actual conversation, if you join the mastermind you can request me the whole discussion\]

Me: Hey, are we still good for today at Jamba Juice(insert address)?

Girl: Can you do it at 5:30?

Me: Yeah sure

Girl: Perfect, its better for me.

**Useful Texts to send**: *Tuesday, Wednesday, Jamba Juice, 5 pm, 6 pm, 7 pm, (insert address), A screenshot of the venue, A screenshot of the address on google,*

**Rationale**: The vaguer the language, the less likely the meet up will take place. You need to sub communicate that you are a leader, and you want to meet her.

**5-Confirm you are meeting that same day if you have to multiple times**

If I'm meeting a girl on Thursday at 6 pm, I text her at noon to confirm that she will come. Moreover, I'll eve text her at 4 pm or 5 pm to make sure she is aware we are meeting. There have been times that a guy will only text her at noon, the girl says, ""Cool."" And then she never shows up.

**Rationale**: More often than not, something will come up. For instance, the girl can be doing Yoga, and then she forgets. **You MUST BE ON HER RADAR**. Again, don't be spamming her; do it a subtle way. I say, ""Hey, I'm got some new sneakers, about to head out!""

**Conclusion**

I hope you guys learn from this list. Flaking is sometimes we all have to deal with regardless of skill level. We want to increase our odds of getting the meetup. Hopefully, you guys can start doing your self-examination as soon as you get the change and reflect on how you've dealt with flaking in the past and how you can improve. Ask yourself:

**""Am I on a girl's radar?""**

**""Am I making the right moves to guarantee that she'll meet up?""**",14Apr2020,0

Hey y‚Äôall. I met my (24F) current crush (26M) here on Reddit two weeks ago, (he messaged me first after seeing some posts I made on another account) we have a lot in common, hit it off right away, exchanged Snapchat to talk off of Reddit, and after some talking, he said he‚Äôd ask me on a date in real life if we didn‚Äôt live so far away. We messaged for hours, almost all night long last Monday, he said he was really attracted to me, a little bit of steamy conversation, etc. Well, sadly, after last Tuesday, he didn‚Äôt message me for two days. I started to stress and feel bad, wondering if he has ghosted me (even though I had told him I had been ghosted before, and how it is hurtful to be ghosted, and he said he wouldn‚Äôt do that to me). Thankfully, he messaged me last Thursday evening on Reddit, using his rommmate‚Äôs phone to tell me that he has lost his phone when he went out for groceries, that he hoped that I read his message sooner rather than later, wanted me to know I wasn‚Äôt ignoring him, and that he‚Äôs planning to message me soon. I replied ‚Äúhey I missed you, I knew something must have happened. Let me know when you find your phone/get a new one.‚Äù 

I haven‚Äôt heard back after basically 4 days. 

So y‚Äôall, idk if I‚Äôm overthinking it but don‚Äôt you think that a week without a phone is just a little bit too long? I guess with coronavirus anything could impede him from getting a new phone quickly, but I miss talking to him and I don‚Äôt want to be ghosted again. I have a big fat crush on him and I don‚Äôt want it to just fizzle out. It‚Äôs not like we‚Äôd ever actually date irl.... Maybe we could find a way to meet, but I doubt it. He‚Äôs just super sweet, cute, and respectful; we seem to be compatible in a lot of ways, and I can‚Äôt stop checking Snapchat and Reddit to see if he‚Äôs messaged me again. :( 

I want to be patient and take his word for it, but I‚Äôm not sure. Yesterday I literally had another guy I was talking to (and I thought he liked me too) ghost me/block me for apparently no reason at all. It sucks guys. I just want to have fun and it‚Äôs not happening lol.

January- diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and put on meds for it. They fuck my mood and system up for 2 weeks then I stabilize. I have shaved my head at this point because of a mental breakdown. I feel really ugly.

February- Turn 26. Didn't think I would make it this far. Yay me. They find a small mass in my mums lung. She's a smoker it's not too uncommon. The world is descending in to chaos.

March - The small mass they found has grown a lot. Biopsy done. Its lung cancer. 6 to 8 months left with chemo. She isn't well enough to do chemo. 2 to 6 months left. Schools close, son is now home all the time, he misses his friends. We get hit with covid-19 hard. My littlest turned 4 we can't have a party but we had cake and she played outside all day with her brother and sister.

April - lock downs start happening. I can't go see my mum anymore she's in another state. She's getting worse very fast. She calls and tells me that hospice is taking care of her now. Mum drugs herself in to a coma for a week.

April 13 2020 - I get a call from my dad. Mum died. I feel like hell. Can't stop crying. Can't go be with my dad due to lockdown and curfew. All I can do is write a shitty reddit post about the worst year in my entire life. And the worst bit is that it's only April.

39,"Hi all

I am often criticising myself for ""wasting my 20s"" and I'm sure there's a lot of you who feel the same. However today I really thought about why I feel this way and what did I do during the supposed best years of my life. So here's a few things I did. Sorry about the formatting I'm on mobile! 

I passed my driving test.

I bought a car outright with my savings! 

I achieved qualifications in accounting 

I've been on holidays to places I really wanted to visit.

I've been on holidays to places I wouldn't have considered myself, and really enjoyed them.

I went to a F1 motor race, on my own! At my dream track, Spa.

I've been to several gigs/festivals

I met my favourite band

I was best man at my best friends wedding, and delivered a speech!

I became a godfather

I became an uncle

I donated to charities I care about

I started a music blog

These are just the ones I can remember off the top of my head. Does that sound like someone that wasted their 20s to you?

I realised I place way too much importance on my career as a judgement of fulfilling a purpose. I've felt I've wasted my 20s because I'm in a dead end job that I don't enjoy, but that doesn't mean I've wasted this part of my life. I did so much outside of my career. For some reason in society career = success and I guess that does apply to some if you're doing something you really believe in or enjoy. But I've labelled myself as an overall failure for being in a job like this, which isn't true. It's a part of your life, not the whole of it. 

Nevertheless, I challenge you to do what I just did if you think you have wasted your 20s too. You'll find you did so much more than you thought if you look at it from a slightly different angle. Plus there is no set ""best time of your life"" phase, there's plenty of people who have said their 30s and 40s were the best of their life (and some even older!)

Also I'm approaching the tender age of 28 so I've still got some time to cram in a few more things!

Thanks for reading, have a good day. I hope this makes you feel better and less guilty like it did me.",14Apr2020,8
40,"All my life I have done nothing extraordinary. Even at 17 about to turn 18. I don‚Äôt know what I want to be in life. I am unattractive, and I have poor communication skills. The thing I‚Äôm best at is eating. I do nothing other than play video games.

I often have ambitions, and a little bit of hope that I‚Äôm going to change, that I‚Äôm going to correct myself. But all of that gets thrown at the window when I wake up in the morning. Now that I‚Äôm typing this it feels like purgatory. I wake up in the morning with little care of what happened yesterday, I idle around until it‚Äôs time for rest, and right before I rest I‚Äôm hit with all the things I could have done instead of idling before I fall asleep and the cycle begins again. 

Each time I have hope, and each time that hope is broken, inspiration is harder to find. Inspiration to keep trying to be better, to act upon being better, but each time, due to varying reasons, that hope is broken. I honestly wish, I could erase myself from all of my friends and loved ones minds, and vanish forever. That way I wouldn‚Äôt hurt them on top of disappearing. 

I just want to restart, but that‚Äôs impossible. 

This sounds like I‚Äôm depressed, but I know don‚Äôt have depression. I usually feel hollow, as edgy as that sounds.

I look at people my age, doing something with their lives, even if not great. Then I look at mine. I literally do bare minimum. It‚Äôs survival, not thriving, surviving.

I just wanted to get that off my chest. I know that I‚Äôm permanently psychologically broken because of how I was raised, and that no matter what I do, I will never have a meaningful conversation with another human ( even that‚Äôs being generous to myself, comparing myself to a human ) I will never accomplish anything and when I wake up next morning I‚Äôm going to forget I typed any of this and I when time comes for self reflection, I‚Äôm going to continue this cycle.

If you made it this far after listening to me talk about how I feel about myself and you have advice, don‚Äôt reply. I usually ask for help and never end up doing anything, and I don‚Äôt even know why. I guess it‚Äôs because of that tiny bit of hope I was talking about earlier.",14Apr2020,5

44,"Probably about 2-3 months ago I was admitted to a crisis center by my university‚Äôs therapist. After being discharged from the crisis center I decided to transfer to another school closer to home (with input from my mother) since I was in a pretty small town attending a rather small and unknown university. The thing is I left everything behind (therapist, dorm, support network, work accommodations) and retuned home which honestly... I don‚Äôt like that much. 

I have no one to talk to, and unlike my old university there counseling services doesn‚Äôt have unlimited sessions. I‚Äôm back home and everyone in my family knows I‚Äôm depressed and suicidal unlike before. At first they were supportive of my mental health condition (I hate using the term depression because I don‚Äôt want to feel like I‚Äôm playing the victim) and it seemed like things were going to change back home in terms of how my mother interacted with me (she‚Äôs a single mother to 3 children which is why she‚Äôs a big focus) and it did at first but now everything is back to the same. 

As much as she has provided for me within my 21 years of existence, she‚Äôs also a main contribution to the way I am. She was constantly in and out of abusive relationships (one of which her boyfriend at the time tried to kill us due to her breaking up with him. He committed suicide in prison though), beat me (discipline) for breaking rules, hell she used to beat me when I was younger for getting spelling words wrong (although I am a bit better than those physically around me at English). Despite this sounding like I‚Äôm ragging on my mom I‚Äôm not. I understand that she had me when she was my age (21) and she probably didn‚Äôt know much better than I do now. 

I‚Äôm just tired of constantly moving from house to house at the whim of those around me. It‚Äôs been like this since I was a child (we were in a shelter hiding from my dad) I am going to be back in school in August, but I‚Äôll be commuting to school now. I have no one I can truly talk to. Mom says I can talk to her, but she also tells me that she hates talking to me (I don‚Äôt really talk that much when I‚Äôm home and just keep my headphones in and stick to myself). I usually keep my interactions with everyone to a minimum though. When I‚Äôm home I only really ever talk to my little brother or I talk to my cousin and her boyfriend (who I‚Äôve been friends with since they‚Äôve been dating but the relationship is starting to grow distance since we don‚Äôt have that much in common anymore outside of the occasional gaming). 

To keep things short, I wish I still had my therapist to talk to. At times I feel like I‚Äôve made a knee jerk reaction when I decided to leave campus and that I didn‚Äôt make the decision entirely on my own. Oh well though.",14Apr2020,2

48,"Tw: autism, anxiety, depression


I‚Äôd like to say I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm wording this right in just typing my thoughts, this has been on my mind for a long time and I figured here would be a good place for it


Id like to start where everything began when I was in elementary school Where I was bullied for being autistic and I developed separation anxiety and would kick and scream to go to school the teachers would have to pick me up from home some days just to get me to go another miserable day 
The bullying effected my all relationships into adulthood I‚Äôve been seeing a psychologist 


I have never been in a romantic relationship because of fear of rejection there was a girl in school I was attracted to but I never asked her out, Even though I really wanted to every time I tried my anxiety peaked and I‚Äôd freeze up and talk myself down and so that is a big regret now I‚Äôll never know.
I‚Äôve used bumble once but deleted it after a day.


On the topic of autism I think I‚Äôm high functioning and try to take steps to improve myself but it is hard dealing with the realisation that your different and won‚Äôt live a normal life and statistically will die by the age of 53 it‚Äôs not easy to think positive.


I find myself worrying about so many things I can‚Äôt change such as my iq or the fact I have autism and try to bring myself back to the present.







Lastly I feel like this social isolation has lasted a lot longer for me in most social situations I try to not say anything because I‚Äôm scared of embarrassment so I hope there‚Äôll be two or more people so they can talk.

52,"Are you tired of rude and disruptive people, instigators, trolls and cyberbullies on Reddit and other social media? The first thing you have to do is ask yourself if you have a tendency to take crap in real life and outside of the internet. If you don‚Äôt already know how to deal with these idiots then you might have a slightly bigger problem,

Check this out: You have to make a conscious decision to stand up for yourself and give stupid, ignorant-ass people shit right back. You have to call them on the illogical, irrational and outright disrespectful crap they say to you with truth, fact and logic. For example: Some people like to do what is called *cherry-picking*. They will intentionally OR quite mindlessly choose one or two words or sentences from your post or comment to pick an argument or start a debate... all while shifting the whole emphasis and narrative away from the *main topic.* Why do they do shit like that? They do it for attention; online 'street cred'; karma points and in many cases... out of sheer stupidity, questionable reading comprehension skills or nothing better to do. There's a real mixed bag of assorted nuts on social media.

Some people do this stuff simply because they are non-diagnosed mental cases... seriously. There are, in fact, what appear to be some rather neurotic, psychotic and straight up weirdos on here just like any other social media platform. Last but not least... there's the bunch that have nothing better o do than spin another person up, embarrass them or troll them because it gives them a sick sense of power they would not have under normal circumstances because cyberbullies in my opinion are nothing but punks. They are like a bunch of little kids perched and waiting for someone to bully, and you become a target if you don't speak up and stand up to them. It does not make you a bad person to tell someone who deserves it to fuck off!

Ive recently adopted a dog and on our local walk we met a person and their dog. 
We have known them about 4 months and it suddenly went from just seeing each other on walks, to exchanging phone numbers (don‚Äôt even know when!) to suddenly meeting everyday to walk the dogs! 

It‚Äôs important to know this person is disabled and finds it hard to walk long distances. They have a big dog, who can be temperamental with unfamiliar dogs and quite dominant. 
Without us meeting them, this dog would get no off lead play (i have more control over the dog and can quickly get it under control if needs be) arguable if it should be off lead at all yes!  The person has admitted to now relying on us for her dog to exercise. Where I don‚Äôt mind meeting once a week or something, I don‚Äôt want to be restricted to it everyday. 
Also i need to be watching my dog and not hers, my dog has it‚Äôs own issues and i am worried these will be neglected if i am concentrating on the other dog. 

I want to be helpful but i feel it is becoming a choir. Im not enjoying my walks anymore and this is not why i got a dog! I feel bad as i want to be helpful.

75,"First thing I did, transfer it to my savings account. First thing my friends does, calls me up saying that she was almost out of money and this helps so much and she's gonna buy booze and throw a party and get another dog. 



Now here's the thing, we make the same amount of money. Actually, she makes slightly more than me. Yet I'm far wealthier. I have a hefty savings, own my home, paid off my car. 

How does this happen. Recently when her car broke down she came to me for the money. It was only $1400. How do you not have that money saved!?

And I constantly watch her blow her money and never use it smart. She's not even using her retirement account! Just straight up deciding to put in 0%

I'll never understand people like this. Ever.

Being wealthy is not about how much money you make, it's how you use the money you make to make more money.

Anyone else in severe need? It has taken over my dreams. I can sometimes sort of masturbate in the shower or bath, but it isn't the same. I like edging a bit. I like fantasizing. I like dirty exploration. I like porn. I like men calling me a dirty slut. I like playing with girls. I like being a toy.

100,"I pressured my ex girlfriend sexually when I was 17. 

This is something that has really started bothering me ever since I matured a bit to realize how wrong it was.

My ex was 16 or 17 and I was 17. We were both each other‚Äôs first relationship and first sexual one. We had just got back from her prom when after we got ready for bed she told me to come to her room and we started making out. At some point at second base, I really wanted head, and asked her if she‚Äôd give me some. She said she was really tired. I kept nagging her. I don‚Äôt remember if she ever outright said ‚ÄúNo‚Äù, I don‚Äôt think so but I‚Äôm not sure. I nagged her to no end - probably for a couple minutes straight. Eventually she acquiesced and that was it. 

She never ever told me that she had a problem with that. I was too stupid to realize it was bad. One day, she broke up with me a week before prom over text, and her friend was texting me telling her I forced her to suck my dick. They must‚Äôve maybe been talking about it and making me out to be some rapey monster or something. 

I deeply regret this incident. I was too young and stupid (and also not very informed about consent but this was no excuse - this is common sense) to realize the power dynamic I had. I had never did anything more than beg - no getting physical in any way, no threatening or anything. Just a bunch of ‚ÄúPleeease! Just for a bit.‚Äù And I understand how she probably felt pressured by how much bigger I was. I had no clue this was a thing. Consent is very important to me now, and for this reason I‚Äôm disgusted by how I acted. I‚Äôve learned from it since.

Hello all,

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

the subbreddit is reddit.com/[r/theredditnation](https://www.reddit.com/r/theredditnation/)

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure  

   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy (for now I will be the ‚Äúking‚Äù)  

      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building  

      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services  

      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port  

      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing  

      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island  

      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location  

   1. Set up the island as a luxury city  

      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island  

      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven  

      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island  

      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure  

   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself  

   * 500,000
* The Port  

   * 200,000 to build  

      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry  

      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings  

   * 1,000,000  

      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services  

   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation  

   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification  

   * 50,000
* Food Supply  

   * We will purchase MRE‚Äôs and other preserved food products for the island
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island  

   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)  

   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include  

      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.  

   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale  

      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax  

   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation  

      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this

He was really timid at first but I fell in love from the moment I laid my eyes on him. I absolutely adored him. He was like a light in my life when everything in my life felt wrong. Even when no one was there for me, he was. He was always present. When I would cry, he would just sit next to me and stare at me. I know it's not super cheesy but it meant so much to me. I am a college student and live in a college apt and that's where I stayed with toffy. But now that I am had to come back home to my parents, my mom said she will not let toffy in her house. I was devastated. I tried so much to explain to her that I really need him in my life. She didn't understand that at all and questioned my priorities of picking a cat over them. I did not want pick my toffy over them. I just wanted my parents to let me keep him and I knew that eventually they would warm up to him because he is such a sweet cat. 

Nonetheless my mom didn't agree and I had to give him up. Thankfully my roommate decided to take him and she sends me pictures of him all the time. But now I feel like there's a hole in my heart with out him.

107,"Let's cut right to the chase. I've always been unclear on what I wanted to do with my life. School was good because I never had even the slightest thought about future, 'cause let's face it, I guess we all were like that in that age? Anyway, I passed out school last year, enrolled for a professional course apart from my graduation, and been at home all year preparing for the professional course's yearly exams. Results came out in January, I failed the first attempt, re-registered for the second attempt, and been studying for it again. 

Now, well, due to the break Coronavirus has spared all of us, I've been reading a lot of articles on the internet, and I've only come to the realisation that, what I'm doing, is nothing but a financial drain on my parents, a mental drain on me, and isn't going to get me anywhere. Not because it's a bad course, or there isn't much scope in the market for these professionals, but because I don't see myself as a professional in that regard. I can't even explain why I'd been lying to myself for the past year, I don't know myself. Maybe I gave into peer pressure? Maybe I didn't know my own interests and signed up for this course? Maybe the invisible societal and parental pressure got the better of me and I couldn't fight it down? I don't know. 

But I'm glad enough that now, I know that this is not what I'm going to do. My vision isn't blurry anymore. I know what I want to be, and I'm gonna work for it. Even though I've lost a year of my life that isn't going to come back, but as they say, ""it came late, but at least it's on the right path at last"" right?",14Apr2020,2

110,"His name was Nacho and we adopted him 9 years ago. He was one of my best buddies, when I got back from the train station halfway home he was already waiting for me and went home with me and ""told me about his day"" (he meowed a lot like he was trying to talk to me) and in summer or when I was sick he brought a lot of dead mices into the house to make sure ""I eat something properly"". One time he even hunted a rabbit and brought it to my room which was really impressiv tbh. He loved to be outside but he made sure to be in the house every once in a while.

He died yesterday at around 7 p.m. CEST. He was laying there in the middle of the floor. Nobody heard him so we assume his death was quick and painless. My sister, who used to do an apprentenceship as a vet assistant half a year earlier figured out that he might have died because his kidney failed because his gums where white. The same day earlier he didn't seem to be ill at all and showed no signs of that. He seemed really active like he usually was. This morning we burried him in our garden and paid our respect for him.

I'm going to miss him a lot. Rest in peace, best buddy.

121,"Let me start out by saying, I love my mother, she does her best and does a LOT for me, but my god she can‚Äôt keep her mouth shut!

Her excuse is, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a mother, it‚Äôs our job to talk about our kids!‚Äù Yeah no it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs disrespectful, ESPECIALLY if you tell them not to tell anyone, but even then they shouldn‚Äôt. 

One time I got checked for testicular cancer when I was 14 (almost 4 years ago) and my results came back negative, thankfully, but my mom decided to call her friend who happened to be a doctor and describe to her in detail, my issues and results. I was furious and embarrassed and when I called her out on it she said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay she‚Äôs a doctor‚Äù. I don‚Äôt care mom, she‚Äôs not MY doctor.

One time at a shoe store, back when I was 11, we were checking out, she saw a sign that was asking for donations for kids with autism and my mom has to mention to the clerk that I was autistic and I immediately got mad with tears in my eyes (this was before I was comfortable with being on the spectrum, I‚Äôm confident and proud of being on the spectrum now). When I got upset I got zero sympathy and understanding, so instead the store clerk told me to ‚Äústop being rude to your mother, she doesn‚Äôt have to buy you new shoes‚Äù. 

I was abused in foster care a few years back (she got accused of doing something she didn‚Äôt, Which is how I got into the system for 3 months) and I told her, and she went around my back and told my psychiatrist , and I was furious. That was almost 4 years ago and she still doesn‚Äôt think she did anything wrong. Her excuse is ‚Äúwell I think he needed to know‚Äù. 

A few years ago I had a phase where I wouldn‚Äôt brush my teeth due to texture issues and my mom had to bring that up in front of everyone, including my friend and friends parents, at my 12th birthday. That caused me to break down in tears due to embarrassment. 


I‚Äôm tired of it. Like I said, I love my mom and she does a lot for me that I‚Äôm greatly appreciative of, But I‚Äôm tired of her being so untrustworthy.",14Apr2020,1

126," So I have this friend, we have known each other for about 3 years now. I think I had a crush on him on and off these past years but essentially I saw him as a friend. I remember last summer I hung out with him and his girlfriend and even though I had feelings for him I was so happy to meet her and didn't feel bad about it at all.

We became a lot more closer these past months. I was away in Erasmus the past semester so we hadn't seen each other or talked a lot at all. When I returned, we became a lot more closer, started seeing each other almost everyday. I remember this exact time that I was like oof, he came over to my house to pick up a bottle of Jager I bought for him on the flight back(duty free). I had to meet up with some other friends that night but he said we should take a shot of it together, so we did. Then we started talking and ended taking 3 more shots and I went to meet with my friends 1 hour late and drunk.

We started to watch a series together(I'm not giving the name because I don't want spoilers). We were watching it together at his place with his temporary roommate. I remember we took a break while his roommate went to the bedroom and we started to have a pillow fight.(he hits hard) Of course, now its corona time\~\~ We are continuing watching the series through Discord now, sometimes I join his conversations with his other friends. The other day we went through his old Facebook posts together or I shared this channel I found on Youtube with him and we talked about it for like an hour.

This is all great, but I know that he sees me only as a friend. I can be sure from the times like when he jokes about my foreign roommate being hot or he watched almost a season of the show without me one time! :\~) So I know that this will never lead to anywhere. I decided I will talk to him about it anyway. Not because I expect something, but because I have to let it out. I had decided to tell him once we finish the series, but I don't know if I want to talk to him about it through Discord or something. I will see, but we are close to finishing it. I know that things will probably be awkward and maybe we won't be friends like we are now. But it will be better for me, to get out of my comfort zone.",14Apr2020,2

132,"Dear Nat 

  
How are you?  
How are you today?  
I hope you are doing fine   
I hope you are breathing fresh air   
I hope your heart is light today   
I hope your conscience is clear   
For the most part   
I hope your day is well spent   
I miss you   
""Really?"", with a surprised look on your face  
""Yes, of course"", me trying to sound confident and not awkward   
We were beautiful   
Like the stars in the sky   
We shined bright   
Making the other stars jealous   
We shined bright   
We shined bright   
We flew in the sky   
We traveled time together as we talked   
Not knowing what hour it is   
We went outside the the eyes of the time-lord  
We skipped time as we were listening to each other   
We traveled time   
I was not grounded anymore   
I got lost   
I got lost in time   
I got lost in you   
In your warmth   
In you   
I didn't know  
""Is it good?""   
Is it good? Should I be grounded?   
But I knew I enjoyed it   
I enjoyed it   
Every bit of it   
Well not every bit   
But most of it  
It died before it started   
It died before it started   


My birthday is coming up   
I don't share it anyone   
Only few of my closed ones know   
I wanted to share that with you   
It's next week   
You wanted to know   
I did not want to share it you that day   
I was not sure if I can trust you with it  
Trust?  
Expectations, was let down too many times   
Don't want to feel that again   
I thought I will share it with you   


You told me ""Don't change, be like this forever""   
You told me ""When I am with you, nothing is normal""  
I smiled   
With a warmth in my heart   
Warmth of acceptance   
Warmth of being wanted   
Warmth of a hug   
What happened?  
How did we die?  
You told me I am good looking  
I have been complimented before   
Rarely   
But I did not believe them   
I believed yours   
It touched my heart   
You told me ""I believe in you""  
It touched my heart   
It touched me   
You touched me   
I believed them   
I still do   
What happened?  
You chose him   
You could not let go of a dead relationship for me   
I was not enough for you   


Were you enough for me?  
That's a new question   
I need to think   
I accepted you   
For what you are  
There are things that I don't like about you  
But I tried to accept you as a whole  


I said ""I want someone to partner up""  
""Who can support, not help, support me""  
""And whom can I support, not help but support""   
I want to experience people   
I want to experience you   
Your colors   
Your shadow   
Your light   
And cry   
Cry my heart out when we say goodbye   
I want to hug you tight   
And cry saying goodbye   
I wanted to feel   
I wanted to say goodbye with an ugly smile   
I want to remember you with a smile   
You said you do too  


I could be me with you  
I felt comfortable   
I felt wanted   
I felt accepted   
That was your greatest gift   
I could be silly   
I could be a kid   
The kid in me could come out  
The kid   
The kid who wants to come out so bad  
He came out when you were around  
I made you laugh   
You found me funny   
You found my words interesting   
The way I name things   
The way I call things   
You laughed at my jokes   
You found me funny   
You did not laugh at me, but with me   
When I said or did silly things   
It was marvelous   


I miss waking up next to you  
The few times that we did   
The weekends   
The weekends that I looked forward to   
You put your head on my chest   
I felt wanted   
I felt like a man   
I forgot how it felt   
I felt like a man   
I felt somehow complete   
We made love twice   
I felt so comfortable with you   
You touched me with affection   
You kissed me   
You kissed me on my cheeks   
You played with my beard   
You were so beautiful   
Not by your shape or skin  
But by you, being you   
You hugged me from behind   
You bumped me with your hip   
As I was cooking with serious face   
And then had no option but to show a embarrassed happy smile   


Where are you now?  
Where have you been in the last week and a half   
You told me to keep in touch   
You told me to keep you updated   
But   
It's not a one way thing  
I don't like to feel needy   
How much?  
How much more need I be needy?  
I can't do this   
I know you mean well   
But you  
You need to say you want me too  
Was I needy?  
I know I was  
When I realized  
I pulled back   
I composed myself again   
Was it too much?  
Remember me, it was not your fault   
Don't go looking for one  
We need to protect ourselves you see  
Don't go looking for faults   


I got rejected for the first time  
By you  
Our first kiss  
I got rejected   
I was happy   
At least I tried   
I was happy   
You said, you have trouble saying no  
I gave you a token   
Like I give myself   
A token, to remind you to treat yourself  
To treat yourself for saying no  
You smiled   
You seemed touch   
I thought it was sweet   


I gave you a space in my heart   
And now you are not there  
Now there is a void   
I am sad  
I feel sadness   
I feel loneliness   
It's okay  
I will move on  
I got stronger   
I have a sweet memory of you  
I wanted to say goodbye to you soon   
Just did not know it would be like this  


This is my first poem   
Or was an attempt towards it   
And it is about you   
What does it mean?  
Does it mean you are special?  
You are to me   
After a long time I have let someone in   
Too afraid to get hurt   
I closed myself from the world   
Like a scared dog   
At the sidewalk   
Who barks trembling with fear   
And none goes to   
I mean why should they?   
It's barking   
I pulled myself together   
My greatest achievement so far   
I was expecting for someone to come along  
And fix me   
I have managed to learn that much   
It's just the void   
It was critical for me   
You were critical for me   
I hold no grudges towards you   


You told me to tell the truth   
You have been lied to   
You were afraid   
Not knowing what I am doing   
You asked me   
I smiled   
I was happy   
I asked you for the same   
I held my end of the bargain   
But you didn't   
I made a fool out of myself   
I exposed myself naked   
I made a fool out of myself   


I thought this quarantine would be my heaven   
With you   
I thought you would say   
""Can I come over?""  
""Do you mind if I stay a bit longer?""  
I thought I would say   
""I would love that""  
With a smile   
With a warmth in my heart   
It was not the case   
You are confused   
You are not sure if you should leave your dead relationship   
Which you did not tell me at first   
But you did eventually   
For that I thank you   
You are confused   
I am not enough for you to leave that relationship   
I thought I was special to you   
You told me  
You are the third person I can talk this freely   
After my best friends   
Did you lie?   
I don't think so   
What do I know?  
I have been fooled before   
More than I like to admit   
This time  
I chose to trust someone   
You didn't call me to say that   
I am sad   
I thought I will spend my birthday with you  
I wanted to   
No matter   
I have been alone all my life   
Even when I was relationship   
Pulling the weight of two  
Like the proverbial donkey   
I can be alone again   
I just hope I will not be lonely   
I won't   
I am stronger now  
It will take me some time   
But I can do it   
I knew we won't last   
But I thought we would be true to each other  
Well we were   
It's just that   
You didn't want me   
Like I wanted you   
I couldn't help myself   
So long I have not felt warmth  
After the warmth you shared   
I fell   
Maybe a bit deeper than I would like  
It's okay   
I feel again   
It's sadness  
For so long, it was gray  
It was gray   
Gray everywhere   
Neither joy nor sadness   


I feel like a fool   
I feel naked   
I feel tricked   


But you didn't trick me  
You were truthful   
For the most part   
And I respect that   


I am just tired you know  
Tired of wanting someones company   
While they don't   
I got over it  
I got good   
I became scary good   
Then I decided to open up   
To feel life   
To share human experience   
I did not want to miss this part of life  
Now I feel like a fool   
Why o why I did that?  
I just said that, the why   


Here I am writing  
I did not know I had so much to write   
It feels good  
A sense of righteousness   
A false sense   
A pride, maybe a ego   


I miss you   
I miss your warmth   
I miss being around you   
I miss being myself around you   
I miss sleeping in the same bed   
I miss sleeping cheek to cheek   
Talking about the face   
I miss holding you whole face with my hand   
Your face is tiny   
I like that  
I miss your hair   
I miss messing it up   
I miss you fixing it as soon as I am done  
I miss when you got insecure   
I could feel it  
Without words  
You asked me, ""Can you read my mind?""  
""Seriously, can you?""  
""How did you know what I was thinking?""  
I thought we had a connection   
I thought wrong   


There are so many details I missed  
Some I want to include  
Some I don't   
This seems unfinished   
What do I know  
I have never written before   
Will anyone read this?  
Does it matter?",14Apr2020,2

138,"Hey, I‚Äôm not sure where to put this.  Im frustrated that I feel like I‚Äôm not physically attractive and would like some help/advice understanding this and putting it in context. I know this isn‚Äôt super important, but if anyone had anything to share I‚Äôd very grateful.

Im M28, and recently got out of a approximately 1 year relationship. My ex never complimented me and we broke up after we realised what she liked about me (what kept the relationship alive) was the attention I gave her. 

I‚Äôm 6ft, pretty fit, I dress quite well I think, I‚Äôm totally hygienic and I‚Äôm bald. Last year I started to properly shave my head. I haven‚Äôt been complimented on my physical appearance in so long- the last two compliments I received were from friends, months ago, and were about my clothes.  I‚Äôve had a few low-key insults about the way I look, generally about my baldness, although I don‚Äôt think people meant anything by this.

I want to be good looking. In the sense that I want some people to actively like the way I look. I want more options when I date, I want to receive more compliments, I want to date people who like me for me- not the attention I provide, and the way I look must be a big part of that (obviously other stuff will be a huge factor!)

I want to know what my expectations should be. Baldness seems to be a big disadvantage in terms of looks- lots don‚Äôt like, lots ‚Äòdon‚Äôt mind‚Äô (which can be ok, but it‚Äôs strange to think ‚Äònot minding‚Äô about a key physical feature is isn‚Äôt a disadvantage). Finally, I was briefly with a woman three years ago who actively really liked the way I looked- including my lack of hair).


I see so many women who are clearly very attractive. It seems there‚Äôs a broad, clear understanding of beauty, sexiness and so on. It may not include all women, but it feels like many people see that the fact that not all women feel beautiful as a problem that needs to be solved.  Many women in my life have been very candid about physical preferences (e.g. height) and many men and women in my life can list of many attractive women. But when it comes to men, I hear of a tiny minority of ultra attractive men be called attractive by women.  I rarely (although occasionally) hear women talk about guys- even quite above average guys- as being physically attractive. (If they are in relationships that is different). When we talk about what makes physically attractive men, it feels much more woolly. It feels like quite often people end up talking about physically attractiveness in men they mean ‚Äòlooks ok, would open to more given he courts me/is funny and kind and confident‚Äô. Which is stark contrast to how I think about attractiveness, which needs to be there at the start. 

I very rarely see men who look like me in the media, (white, young, not-ripped bald guys). Most of the guys who people say ‚Äòbald guys can be hot‚Äô about are generally super muscly older celebrities who are otherwise very attractive.  Otherwise I‚Äôll be told to ‚Äòrock‚Äô my baldness, which I don‚Äôt know what this means.

People treat me differently now that I shave my head - it was incredible how much strangers would chat to my ex when we were in public. It very rarely happens to me.

I‚Äôve never really had any good advice on what is actively physically attractive?? I saw an askreddit thread the other day asking what made men attractive. Some of the answers are like ‚Äòbeing a good cook‚Äô. I have no doubt that in some sense this is attractive. But it‚Äôs not physically attractive. Most advice to be physically attractive is basic stuff I already do- I shave my head, I look after my skin, I‚Äôm fit, I‚Äôm clean, I dress pretty well (I like the way I dress and generally put in a lot of effort, but as far as I can tell it‚Äôs only me who thinks that).

My question is, what should my expectations be about being physically attractive? What else can I do to improve? Sure I can lift more etc, but I can‚Äôt imagine that there‚Äôs much that‚Äôs going to radically improve me against the points I listed above. For me, having good, realistic expectations is the best way for me to be happy.

Finally, I‚Äôve had a couple of women friends get out of relationships recently. Men they say they were never attracted to. I don‚Äôt want to be getting to know a women in a romantic situation while she doesn‚Äôt fancy me back.",14Apr2020,1

But I also remember how you called me for the last time to suddenly end it and tell me it was over..just like that, while not even an hour before then, you said I'm not going anywhere, yet you just came back to tell me you no longer wanna be with me.

the funny part is how a week before then I had my demons telling me to leave you because of all those flaws I chose not to see, instead I chose to love them and help you get over them like you said you wanted, but the moment I showed my weakness you left.
