0,"I sometimes have long nights, I can't sleep and I'll just peruse social media till I inevitably sleep (bad habit I know). But in this dazed state, I'll often comment and like things without much thought. So a voice actor working on an upcoming game posted something, and I commented that I had never played any of the previous games and never had the courage to ask my parents for any of them. So he responded asking me to DM him, so I did and he happily offered me a free copy of the game when it comes out as a gift... I sadly accepted and didn't realize till after the fact that I would have to explain the whole situation to my parents. I DM'd him today trying to explain my situation but I did so poorly so he didn't understand and still said he ""wouldn't break his promise"" and that it was ""his pleasure"".

I don't want to bug him anymore, but the story isn't entirely true and I don't want to get called out for ""lying"" to this guy by my family even if they were the most minuscule lies.",30Aug2020,1

4,When I (24m) was 9 years old I went to play at a friends house. I lied to my mom about where I was going because she didn’t know this friend or his parents. When I spent too long there I hurried home to find a panicked mother who was really angry at me. I was feeling ashamed and ready for a good whoopin when my mom decided to change things up. She pulled out a rubber tube about 18 inches long and yelled at me telling me to spank HER! Me being 9 I was shocked and confused. She screamed at me saying it’s my fault she was a bad mom and she needed to be punished by me. I cried the whole time. My dad was at work and to this day doesn’t know about it. My mom and I don’t get along well but 16 years later I still feel so confused about it. It’s worse now that I have a son of my own and due to COVID I live with my parents with my wife. Idk if this is where this should be posted. But am I wrong to be confused?,30Aug2020,1
6,"I've been looking after this nice cat that has been coming around my house lately. I slowly got him to come over, accept food, and all that. He hung out around the area coming by 2-3 times a day for food and attention but today he didn't show up at all. I hope that he's okay. He's neutered and declawed, which makes me think he's a former house cat, but he was so scrawny I felt like he was abandoned. 

I was going to grab him up this morning and take him to a vet appointment but obviously that didn't happen. Hopefully someone caring is looking after him, or hey, maybe he'll come by tomorrow. There's always that chance.",30Aug2020,1

8,"People forgive other people for all kinds of things. There are plenty of redemption stories we happily sign on to, and plenty of mistakes we sympathize with. Even major things, violent things that people go to jail for.

But there are people who do less than that who we don't forgive. It's often been my observation that no one in our society gets treated worse than a loser. A psychopath who succeeds, we can't help but at least be impressed, or fascinated. But if Charles Manson had been a *loser*...imagine a Charlie Mansion with a conscience, but still crazy and awkward, working a dead end job, and complaining about how no one takes him seriously enough. Ick. Gross. What a loser. No one puts that Charles Manson on a T-shirt.

We forgive a lot of things, but we don't forgive pathetic.

I've been pathetic. I've been that kid who tries to weasel his way into a social group, tries to act like them, fit in with them, and takes however they want to treat him without complaint. It's difficult to care or connect with someone who makes themselves a non-person to you.

With women, the same. Almost anything would have been better that the construct I made myself into, made up of bits and pieces of what I thought women wanted, striving to never step wrong in it.

And the need behind why people do that makes it all the more tragic. I needed to people to like me. So. Much. It hurt so much not to be accepted, and felt so good to belong, I would have done...not anything, but plenty. The people who do this do it out of need, and yet they wind up getting some of the worst cruelty hurled in their direction because of it.

Knowing this doesn't save me from it, either. I still look out at the world, and see things I wish I was a part of. And imagine how amazing it would be to have it. It's almost obligatory that I then think about how I might be able to strategize my way there, and have to catch myself doing it. 

And it's not like it never works, at least at first. Being a chameleon will indeed ingratiate you in the beginning. But at some point you will reach it's limits, and fail to develop the deeper bonds you see others developing around you. You might find people who are happy enough to have you around, but then you catch things, like how they plan for the birthday of someone else, and realize no one was ever inspired to do that for you. 

That's also the way you find yourself into a group of people who will forgive one another for many things, but the things they do are part of who they are, and something real about them, that is piecemeal to the bonds that bring them together in the first place. But they won't forgive your fakeness. So, when you dare to open yourself a bit more, like you see others doing successfully, you painfully realize that your crimes don't get forgiven. You are the worst. The least forgivable.

And then you get hurt. And then you get scared. And then you need it even more, but have even less confidence in your ability to not step wrong. Deadly cycle time. And all that time, you wonder how you did something so horrible to deserve this. You might even get cynical and bitter, and decide you might as well be a truly horrible person, because then you'd at least get treated better. 

There's no real point or ending. It's just a piece of something I struggle with, and find interesting.",30Aug2020,1

10,"Hello, currently my friend group got split up real bad and I don't have anyone to really talk to about this so I'm just going to vent here. 

Before COVID we were in school 5-6 of us, we'd constantly hang out and talk. Since COVID post quarantine started to hit. I wanted to stay safe and I even quit my part time job so I don't have to go outside. Only one of my friends also stay home but only because of their parents being strict on them. Other than that it's hard for me, most of the time I'm the only one online in our discord with no one to talk to since they're still living the life going to places, eating out, shopping or whatever. I see it on social media constantly and it hurts, I'm stuck on deciding whether to delete social media all together because of it.

11,"Listen, 

No matter what your political views are, we can all agree that we should respect the democratic process. Getting a crowd to chant ""12 more years!"" is just terrifying. I am so scared where this is all heading. I know many would laugh or brush off this fear, but this stuff has happened in other countries before and it is going to happen here if we do not do anything. It's come to the point where this whole election has ruined my mental health. My anxiety is the worst it's ever been. I have not had one single day where I can breathe a sigh of relief.

12,"It's 9:30. And you aren't really tired yet so you lay in bed under the covers listening to the muffled sounds of you're parents spending the rest of the evening together. The TV is on and you hear two Italian men talking very mean to each other, then a couple gun shots.

You're mother is doing dishes while dad is watching the sapranos from the couch. You can tell your mom is watching aswell because she'll occasionally ask aloud something on the lines of ""did Tony talk to that guy?"". The chatter between your parents sometimes lightly escalates to a minor argument. 

The dishes are done. You only hear the show now. You listen but don't comprehend what is happening in the show. Most of the words are too muffled to understand, but you listen with curiousity. The show ends then they exchange a few more words. You hear a couple dishes jingle in the sink. They walk one after another in to their bedroom next to yours. You here lighter softer chatter between them. Then silence.

Ha I totally just got you to think about you're parents banging.

13,"It’s 12:13 AM and I just stuffed the shit out of my nose to the point where I can’t breathe through it and swallowing makes my nose *scream* because I was crying over imagining pretend parental figures telling me they’re proud of me, so I thought I might as well ask Reddit for something like that. It’d be really nice if just one person could read this and tell me they’re proud of me. If not, that’s cool too, though, I usually write more than people can be bothered to read. I’ll try not to make it too long. TL;DR at the bottom.

I’m going into high school in a couple of days and I’ve been stressing and overthinking about not being able to make friends for literal months. I handled the online school portion of the last school year so badly that I had a breakdown in the first week, started acting out in class (to the point where even my best friend said I was being an asshole) sometime around that, and stopped going to class altogether for the sake of my mental health by the second week. So, naturally, I thought I would handle online school the same way this time and I’d accidentally establish myself as “the asshole” and nobody would want to be my friend.

I’ve never been the one people liked first or more. The majority of my friends are only my friends because they were friends with my best friend first, then they started talking to me because my best friend wanted us to be friends or because I was clingy and hung around them awkwardly. And I really didn’t want to be so pathetically unlikable that I couldn’t make friends without her help, and I also really didn’t want to have to force myself through online school alone.

So, during orientation, I did my best to be a cool person. I made jokes, tried to make conversation, asked questions, volunteered for things, even made a group chat with my advisory. I think I have anxiety, so I found myself shaking a lot of the time because I was so scared, but I did it and I think it worked! Within just a few hours of knowing each other, my advisory and I were talking about everything from our classes to our trauma and I was just so relieved and happy that people actually liked me for me for once. We even turned all of our cameras on so the only one of us who always had hers on wouldn’t be alone and though the teacher wasn’t in on it, she was happy we had our cameras on.

I’m still scared that they think I’m annoying or I look like I’m trying too hard or I’m being bossy or too outgoing, but I’m trying, really, I am, and I just want someone to tell me it’s enough and that they’re proud of me. I wish I could go to my actual parents instead of having to ask strangers on the internet, but my mom barely even mentioned my graduation, much less congratulated me on it, and she certainly didn’t ask how I was handling online school the first time, so I don’t think she’d care enough. Reddit will have to do for my need for validation.

TL;DR - I usually struggle a lot with making friends on my own, but this time I really tried to push myself out of my comfort zone and I just want someone to be proud of me for being able to do that and make friends so fast.",30Aug2020,1

24,"I also posted this in relationship_advice but this felt good here, too.

I’ve been friends with him for about two years. The first year we were friends was great, however, at this point, we weren’t super close. He was a pretty great friend, cool with most people, not super hostile, all around great.

In the past year, we’ve gotten much closer, but this has only been detrimental to our relationship I feel. 80% of the time, he’s like he was a year ago, just super nice and outgoing. However, 20% of the time, something in him changes and he becomes incredibly toxic and emotionally abusive. He’ll get physical for little to no reason, he’ll say cold and callous insults, he’ll be intentionally mean and hostile, and then never apologize or acknowledge that he was wrong. He purposely made one of our friends cry and leave the groupchat and then deleted the messages and pretended it didn’t happen.

If it was anyone else, I would’ve dropped him a long time ago, but I learned not too long ago that he’s gone through a lot of sexual abuse and trauma and that being hostile can sometimes be a reaction to those kinds of trauma. As such, my mutual friends and I are scared to call him out.

He also tends to put on an act of not caring about other human beings or relationships, talking about how he doesn’t care if he fucks up his relationships or if everyone in his life died. He also onetime mentioned that he has thought of ways to kill all of us. The more that I think about it, the more I realize how psychotic he is, but once again, we know he’s gone through a lot in his life and he tends to guilt trip so he’s never been called out. My fear is that even if he’s properly called out, he’s not gonna change his behavior, just shrug his shoulders and pretend he doesn’t care. 

I’m really frustrated. He’s babied a lot by the rest of my friends (he’s the youngest of us all) and is always treated with kindness by us but is so mean and manipulative sometimes. Even if I dropped him, I doubt my other friends would follow suit and I’m sure I would just get pushed out of the group instead. I don’t necessarily want to lose him as a friend, but I want him to realize that he cannot continue to be an asshole to people who care about him. 

How do I go about talking to him? Do I talk to him at all? Do I just ghost him? Any and all feedback would be very appreciated.",30Aug2020,1
26,"Not doing this for clickbait. I just needed to talk. It's dark. It's late. I'm by myself. I take anxiety pills, and they havent been working tonight. I'm tired. My husband is out late working. All I want is to talk to somebody, but nobody is available. I live my life in fear of others. I don't know how to crawl out of the hole sometimes. I rely on someone always coming home. I know I can't be alone for too long or else I'll feel like this. Sometimes my cats and my writing isn't enough to sustain me. I want to fall in love again. Be it with friends or family, or life itself. C virus is ruining everything. I have never been to a club. I need to experience life. Drinking with friends. If you have people in your life who dont havefriends, then take the time to include them when you go out with yours. Its as simple as that. People who dont talk about it are the ones who end up taking their lives. And I am not the type who posts on regular social media about it, because I am not an attention seeker. I love every person in my life. But at the moment it's not enough for me. So i have to suffer for as long as this spell lasts. It's hard, but I can do it.

Dear D, I miss you. I wish we could be friends and hang out again. I feel this way about all my old friends. I miss them so much. - K

The stillness and the darkness feels so strong now. The TV shows were cancelled, and sadly that's what I was looking forward to. I'm trying my best to press forward. To cross the finish line. My goals. I'm trying so hard.

 And I am running out of willpower.

Someday I will be reborn, and I hope that I will have a better life, a happier one. I want to learn how to love others and myself. Right now there is emptiness inside. I hate that feeling. And it's like no song, no movie, no youtuber, nothing can fill that void except for human kindness. Why is everyone always with someone else? They are busy. I am tired. So tired. And yet all the world wants to talk about right now are blm and c virus. When people are still struggling with mental health, the world is focused solely on the election, on riots and protests, on sickness. I need some positivity, aside from that fakeness youtubers put out. I wish that stranger things would come back. That show really lifted me up.

If I could do anything for you right now world, it would be to fix you. And all of your problems. I would give you the tools you need to finally fix yourself. You could kill yourself, or you could fix yourself. I think that would be a better ending to the story, to have tried all that you can until the end does come. I wish I could be honest with everyone I knew. I wish I could be nice to everyone. I wish that the world were less judgemental and more forgiving. I wish that people saw people as themselves. I hate living in a world that only wants to hate itself.

Please be decent to each other. And take no one for granted, no matter how despicable they are. Please don't let the hatred overcome the goodness of human beings. Please. Or else there is no point of living for any of us. It would be fighting until the end of the earth. Let there be peace.

The time i would sleep and wake up an eat and work, just didn't mesh with the rest of the house and often times I would disturb your sleep before you had to get up for work because you're a morning person and I'm a night owl.

34,"i have the utmost respect and sincerest admiration for the glorious, beautiful, black, fly. truly free. satisfied to exist in the foulest, most intolerable conditions imaginable, the wealthy fly is liberated of the burdens of greed, lust, envy, sloth, wrath, gluttony and pride. 

the fly is not hindered by ego, insecurity or jealousy and has no desire to manipulate, deceive, dominate or commit acts of aggression to deprive others of happiness, valuable property or security for personal gain. it does not seek attention or require approval, assurance, attention or validation.

 despite the god-like fly's obvious supremacy it never judges others for their pitiful inferiority, their endless, hopeless, futile, arbitrary efforts or their numerous inadequacies, especially the things beyond their control such as birthplace, color or heritage. the patience of the munificent fly is immeasurable. the invincible fly never looks down upon others despite joyfully soaring above them. 

the fearless fly is confident and acts decisively without hesitation, malevolence, vengefulness, spite or shame. as an ignorant, ungrateful child i once mindlessly laid my head on a desk and was mercifully graced by a prescient, majestic fly who selflessly and generously defecated liberally in front of me only to delightfully soar away never to be seen again.

 i often ponder if flies always land to produce feces. humans never release their waste while mobile unless being chased by a terror such as a lion. none can challenge the power of the great almighty fly. even the lion doesn't dare oppose the invincible fly who would effortlessly evade him while taunting it with laughter and feast lavishly on the fruit of the it's tireless, relentless labors, its excrement, multiplying thousandfold in the process and tormenting the lion's helpless decendants for generations to come. 

perhaps preceding the arrival of mankind, the eternal fly will survive long after our foolish self-destruction. we would all do well to learn from the wise, noble, enlightened fly, unhindered by logical fallacies, whose perception encompasses virtually all directions granting it immunity to deception. all bow down to the immortal, omnipresent, all knowing fly. 

we should beware of arrogantly deluding ourselves that we are capable of anything beyond aspiring to emulate the greatness of such an undeniably flawless and perfect being. let us free our minds so possibly one day we can all fly away together.

You see everything was alright, we were at voting place but then my father started to shout some names, his political views, and in the end he loudly say for who he will vote(right after that his vote was not valid). Since I started with my father I have to say that he was raised by alchocolic father and mother who neglected him. This took an impact and know he's bitter man in his late fifties. He was also alchoholic, but eventually decreased drinking habbit. He is really loud, any little spark can start fire, which will last for hours. Keep in mind that usually news and tv sparkle him up and he watches them daily. He is really negative and I feel that I soak every drop of that negativity.

46,"You can lose your only horse at your farm, it may be judged as bad but if the next day he comes back with other wild horses, now you have more horses, it may be judged as good so the consecuences are unknown and our judgment is what triggers the suffering inside, not the event. Then those wild horses can kill your son while he tries to domesticate them, then his death can lead you to meet again with an old friend and marry her but turns out to be a psychopath but then... And so on...

[This is based on the Story of the Chineese Farmer]

You may say ""but pain is real, if you got hurt, that can't be good"". But you don't have to think that approaching your hand to the fire is bad, there's no need to judge it, your body knows perfectly what to avoid and what to approach, it's well written in our genes. Pain need no judgement from the mind, it's a tool that shows us the way, most humans try to avoid it without listening to its message, without looking at the object it points: they just want to get rid of it because they judge it as ""bad"".

Let's take another example. ""Yeah but how the hell can war be judged as good?"". Here is where most people misunderstand this idea I share with you. It's not about judging things in a different way, it's about not judging. When I say to myself ""don't judge war"", I'm not saying ""war is good"", I'm just not judging. That being said, we may debate how judging could be at the root of war but that's another debate. Do you remember those veterans saying ""oh man, I loved that war, that combat adrenaline, those brothers I shared everything with, those girls..."". 

Have you ever experienced a chained sequence of bad events? As if one tragedy concatenates with the next? Maybe there's an intrinsic nature in the universe that makes things worse and worse in a downspiral? And there's also the opposite phenomena. We may try to explain this by ""when you get weak, there are more chances to be weaker and vice versa"". What if that's not the case? What if our perspective changes after a ""bad"" event and that is really what triggers more ""bad"" events? What if the judgement of the events is what really makes them ""bad""? I've suffered depression for years and when I'm on drugs/medication, reality seems to offer more possibilities, as if I was filtering out all the chances to get a friend, a girlfriend, a job, etc.: all the things I judged as ""good"".

Damn it, what about those vikings loving the idea of death by combat so they can reach Valhalla?

Buddha said desire is the root of suffering. I think that was a limited insight. It's more like ""Judging is the root of Suffering"" and desire is a form of judgement. Find an example in your life, on how you judged that girl/boy so cute and nice then the opposite after ""completing"" your love story. 

To end this post, I'll put my taoist hat on. There's duality in our mind's nature, two hemispheres, two modes of thinking, two modes of judging... In the middle, in the Aurea Mediocritas, at the middle of the river, there lies the non-judgemental path. If you suffer, maybe you're not aligned with that Tao.

Thanks for reading, I don't hope you enjoyed this post since expectatives are desires, desires are a form of judgement and that leads to suffering. No more energy for it right now so feel free to downvote ;) Share your thoughts if you like.",30Aug2020,1

49,"I cannot believe I am the only person, to my knowledge, that is disturbed by this woman’s actions and see her as the one responsible for the situation her child is now embroiled in.

Back in my day... and I am not even “old”... my mom was hesitant to let me stay out too late at the mall at 17, not wanting me to get into any trouble... as teenagers are apt do... and there was no protesting or rioting or civil unrest...

It is just unfathomable to me that a mother would drop her child off at a protest with a deadly weapon like he’s meeting his friends at Hot Topic. This is not normal.

This kid was apparently not even old enough to drive. He was not from the town or even from the state. She literally had the power to say, “No, honey, I appreciate how passionate you are but these protests are dangerous and I don’t want you getting hurt.” Or even, “Yes, honey, you can go to the protests and show up for what you believe in but you have to be home by curfew... and NO, you can’t bring the AR.”

What the hell happened to common sense parenting? She dropped her kid off at a heated protest in one of the most dangerous and unpredictable times in America as far as common memory goes... with an AR... how is nobody talking about how irresponsible and fucked up that is?

And look, before anyone says “well he wasn’t the one who started the altercation” YES I understand all that. But just try to look at the bigger picture here.

You’ve got a seventeen year old boy who hasn’t even voted yet, doesn’t even live in the town or state, and can’t even drive open carrying a deadly weapon and parading up and down the streets. A gun he shouldn’t even have in the first place because he is still a CHILD.

We have TRAINED PROFESSIONALS coming under literal and figurative fire for how they handle crisis situations with deadly force... and you expect a seventeen year old kid with no experience to be able to handle things any better?

Just the fact that she allowed him to take the gun in the first place shows me that she was ok at least with the idea having him to use it... so she must have known violence was a possibility... and yet encouraged and enabled him to go anyway...

I was good at my job, and when I lost it, I was crushed.

Unemployment was great, don’t get me wrong. $600/week after working part time would be nice to anyone. But I would’ve given it up if it meant having my job back. I missed everything about it, even down to the musty smell of the break room and cold under-cooked lunch ramen.

I got too nervous and pressed unmatch and then ‘no reason’ option but it didn’t do anything just stayed on the options of why I unmatched. Then I noticed it was because my phone wasn’t connected to internet as of about 30 seconds before so I had to go back in the other room to get it back so I went off the app (I kept the app open didn’t close it down) and reconnected back to the internet then went back on tinder and it was back at the match screen as normal when before I was on her profile stuck in the unmatch select reason why options screen ( I didn’t go off her profile before ever) . Did it go through as normal when connected  to the Internet again? Normally when iv been unmatched while looking at someone’s pics the pics grey out and name disappears to ‘user’ but it didn’t at all with her and I was   at the home matches screen as normal  when I went back on the app right after connecting back to the internet.

Would the following disqualify me in the public eye?  


I have a history of depression and complex PTSD from childhood abuse. I was officially diagnosed with borderline personality disorder 7 years ago after I tried to kill myself in front of my wife. She left, of course, and in the years since, I have been hospitalized twice for suicidal ideation.  


I have always struggled with a sense of purpose. I can't justify my existence unless I'm doing something valuable for the people around me. Political office is the ultimate conclusion of that idea, and I see that so many of our candidates simply don't possess this desire to make the world better.

It's been almost 5 months since our break up so I'm not sure what the deal is. Yeah I still think about her/miss her but im not over here dwelling about it.

86,"Following Chadwick Boseman’s death, there was a tweet that got pretty big that said something like “Chadwick Boseman felt he had to hide his cancer, swallow this sickness to be successful, ~and that’s what disabled people face everyday.” It rubbed me the wrong way a little bit. I couldn’t find any quotes stating that this is why he hid his cancer (to get jobs and be successful). In my mind, it seems just as likely that someone would keep their cancer a secret in the public eye so they could deal with it privately with friends and family. Privacy doesn’t equal secrecy in my mind. To me, it seemed disrespectful to act like you know why a dead person made a decision, even if you face a similar issue. 

This girl who is a friend of my brother’s put the tweet on her instagram story. I replied to it asking if he had said this and saying it was weird to speak for a dead person and she went off on me, saying “she had nothing to say about my ableism” and overall being very petty. For context, she has some sort of respiratory chronic illness (my brother says). [Here’s the DM conversation](https://imgur.com/a/P3rs0NZ) if you want to read the whole thing. She ended up messaging my brother saying she wanted to punch me and that she was going to block me. 

In my mind, if I died of cancer and people started saying I was keeping it a “secret” to be “successful” when I just wanted to deal with it privately, I would be a pretty pissed off ghost. That’s not to say that many people don’t keep their cancer private for that reason. I just feel like it’s weird to use an objective statement on behalf of a literal dead person who can’t dispute or agree with that speculation. 

I am personally on the spectrum and I feel that at times it is a disability in my life. It causes me many social problems, causes focus issues, and depression (amongst other things). If I died, and someone said I was hiding this about myself for other’s perception (it’s “mild” enough that people don’t notice because I’m a woman), I would also be pissed. It’s no one’s business what I’m going through. 

So do you think I’m “ableist” for thinking this? I find that idea a bit silly considering many people in my family have disabilities and I have always advocated for issues they face. I just draw the line when it comes to speculation about a person who literally died within 24-48 hours.

My girlfriend and I play on an online game, and we were chilling and chatting with a few people. It was quite relaxed, and we were having fun. My girlfriend is quite good at roasting people, and we usually have a lot of banter with people. It's fun, and fairly harmless. 

Now, this one dude decided after about almost an hour of talking to add my girlfriend on Discord (her discord name is on her profile), and she has a picture of herself as her profile picture. He made a comment about it, saying she looked like a younger version of his grandmother. 

My girlfriend took offense, and she told him as such, and he said that she had been roasting everyone but that she couldn't take it when she got roasted. It should be noted that he and the others had roasted her plenty of times before, but she never took offense to anything they said - she just found it offensive because he wasn't roasting her, he was ""complimenting"" her. 

Now, the guy just wouldn't back down. He kept defending himself, saying it was a compliment, or going back on it and saying it was a roast. I got involved when she went quiet because I knew that she was upset. I told the guy it wasn't a compliment, and that it wasn't acceptable.

He then responded by saying he didn't understand why I was getting involved, and that the situation had already finished. He then spent the next couple of minutes calling me a ""simp"" and repeated over and over again that I shouldn't have gotten involved and that I needed to just shut my mouth. 

I argued with him briefly, but then my girlfriend got back into the fray, and I noticed that he seemed to crave the last word - every time I responded, or she responded, he would have to make another comment, either something along the lines of ""it's already done with stop talking"" to something as simple as ""okay, okay"".

Eventually people started to gather around us to watch the fight, it was just him and her arguing by the end, and some random guy had gotten involved saying it seemed like she was being dramatic, but that he was also being rude. 

Now, I suppose there's a possibility she was being sensitive, and that I probably should've left them to it, but the guy was just so loud and obnoxious. I'm also not very good with confrontation, so that probably didn't help.

Also, side-note: I've noticed when some people online argue nowadays, they really don't... Well, argue. They just eventually go to: ""oh wow, you're so mad"" ""why are you so mad"" ""why are you so serious about this"" or some variant of it. Kind of like pseudo-gaslighting, make the person believe they're in the wrong for using proper arguments. Seems kind of... I dunno. Feels like they're just desperate to be right. 

Double also: Why do people feel the need to call people simps if they defend a girl in a public space? Yeah, there are probably dudes who do it to win the girl's approval, but there are so many people out there who are just genuinely decent.",30Aug2020,1
96,"work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked away to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as s was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

I’m 6ft tall and thin and lanky and she’s very pretty tbh",30Aug2020,1
98,"I am good at searching cause I am an edgelord in all senses. 

I found lots of good and efficient things to enjoy, ways for a better life. More than anyone I know.

Yet now, nothing more. Search irritates. Age comes. Brain is now not a free mind, it takes on a form and stays forever.
 
Thing is, I know something is hidden. And yet, no logical jumps to know. No conventional ways.

It's still a good form I made for myself, though. 
Farewell, freedom of choice.",30Aug2020,1
99,"This might be stupid and know I should stop psycho-analyzing myself but whatever! I think im insecure because no one ever let me try anything. If one of my schoolmates had a really cool toy everybody  was given a chance to try it but me. If my sister got a new game I was never allowed to try it. She always played UNO but I was never allowed even if I just wanted to play it with my dad.

I was never given a chance to learn how to do something, the entire idea was just dismissed. No wonder I have issues,  if I'm never given a chance how was I supposed learn how to be resilient and how to actually learn?",30Aug2020,1
101,"As the title says. I've attempted both and had some traumatic experiences. Some people would say the traumatic experiences would play into me not wanting them, but even before I had them, I always felt like it was something I had to do, not something I wanted to do. 

I feel sexual attraction, but I don't want to have sex with anybody but myself (i.e. masturbation). Calling myself asexual would be incorrect imo, and I don't want to dabble into ace microidentities. It took a lot out of me to accept that I felt sexual attraction to men as well as women already, and I don't want to come out again as something that probably isn't even accurate. 

Calling myself aromantic would probably be correct, though. I like platonic relationships and have a lot of those. Every time I've tried something more than that, it felt forced. It felt like me going through the motions of what a human is supposed to feel, not anything that I really wanted. I didn't really enjoy having sex, and I didn't really enjoy being in a relationship. I want to have an active social life and that's it. 

A lot of my friends and the entertainment I'm interested in talk about their desires for sex, romance and family, and I always feel alienated. It just isn't something I'm interested in. I wish I wasn't so weird, but I'm also tired of having to keep up a front and pretend to be into things that I'm not. It's just something I don't understand.",30Aug2020,1

104,"Had a 1000-1200 income a month as a 17-19 year old. (Tax free)My only bills were my college books, gym membership, and gas for my car. I’d save a big chunk of that but I’d spend the rest

At 19.5 I joined the military and here came the bills. I’m crying now after I see how much I pay in taxes the rest is used up in food/gas and internet/phone bill 😭",30Aug2020,1

Continue working and buy a timeshare in Vermont after having a couple of kids or some shit? Why do we continue for after the point of what we deem to be our personal ""success""? I feel kinda lost now really. And any venture just seems like ways to fill in that whole inside of you.
