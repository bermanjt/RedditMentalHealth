0,"so i was thinking about the fact that i have some really bad trust issues and how my addiction to having subtitles on with movies/series has been feeding and nurturing it. Even if I can make out what the characters are saying i still feel the need to put on subtitles. It's curious to me because I myself am a pathologic liar, i would probably attribute my trust issues to that as well, but the feeling i get when not being 100% sure of the dialogue is a lot like the feeling i get when not trusting people's stories. Just wanted to hear some other opinions on this subject matter. TIA",14Oct2019,1
1,"Hello, this problem has been bothering me for ages and it’s getting worse. 

The problem is that I have a STRONG tendency to doubt myself, especially my own intelligence. 

Our society is filled with the IQ related stuffs and most of us probably have to deal with the judgement given by others. 

Whenever I start studying, instantly this thought comes up; “those people around me probably learn faster, better and deeper than me.” “Those people have a high IQ they probably get things instantly” “I’m bad at everything so slow, forget so quickly, no matter how hard I work it makes no noticeable difference” etc

These thoughts come up, I end up daydreaming for several hours without studying. This negative spirals also lead me to research obsessively about the intelligence related topics every single days, so i decided to ask on this reddit. 

Why the hell is this happening to me? I think this is getting pathological. 

I also get so depressed by how damn I am and I have absolutely no confidence on whatever I do. 

Nevertheless, nobody says anything about my intelligence. It is after all my own imagination. I am thinking that it has to do with how I grew up. 

My mother always had told me about the IQ and she was obsessed to compare me with others. 
This problem really needs to stop. It’s getting in the way of studying and I can’t grow up by having this. 

Please help!",14Oct2019,1

5,"I hate seeing posts in social media that identify a problem or issue, but do nothing to offer a solution. Phrases that are commonly posted include: “why is no one talking about this”, “I just want to start a conversation / open a dialogue”, and the one I hate in particular, “we need to raise awareness”. 

I’ve seen these phrases alongside a wide variety of issues, to include male suicide rates, honey bee populations, deforestation of the Amazon, black incarceration rates, mass shooting statistics, and so on. Posters will regurgitate some statistical data, provide a link to an article, or write about their personal difficulty (or a loved one’s personal difficulty) with an issue. What usually follows is a humorous quip, a sarcastic comment about the state of things, or a dig at a political leader. 

I hear this rhetoric during interviews as well. Wether it’s major media, local news, podcast, what-have-you, there is a tendency for people to couple their position on an issue with the meager objective of ‘raising awareness’. 

‘Raising awareness’ is the poorest method of problem solving for 3 reasons. 

(1) It is typically used as means to draw attention to the poster / speaker, but does not allow for criticism. People use relevant issues as a means to offer a comment or opinion, but are protected by their stated goal of ‘raising awareness’. Awareness raisers can’t be criticized because the only position counter to raising awareness is lowering awareness. Therefore, critics of the poster / speaker are not seen as being critical, but instead are seen as denouncers of the problem. This dynamic allows the poster / speaker to make a statement without having to defend it. 

(2) This kind of rhetoric does little to further progress. The rationale behind raising awareness is that if more people are aware that a problem exists, more people will try to solve the problem. Mathematical probability would indicate that this is true, but it does not hold up in practice. Solutions typically do not require more people to work, they require the right people to work. For issues to be solved, what is usually required is experience with the issue, wisdom to anticipate desired outcomes, academic or first-hand knowledge regarding the issue, or any combination thereof. These qualities don’t need to be solicited from the masses, because people with particular skills will seek out, of their own accord, particular problems that they are capable of solving. People seek out problems because they wish to be employed and payed. If you are not offering employment, offering solutions, seeking qualified individuals or groups, or soliciting donations, then you are not accomplishing anything. Raising awareness only gathers the attention of people who don’t have the means or will to solve the problem, or people who are already trying to solve the problem. 

(3) The biggest reason to avoid the ‘raising awareness’ method, is because it perpetuates the idea that problems cannot be solved without widespread attention. Invariably, regardless of the issue they address, awareness raisers always posit 3 ideas: there is a problem, there is insufficient general awareness of the problem, and the existence or severity of the problem is a result of the level of awareness surrounding the problem. If we agree with this 3-part premise, then our best solutions are achieving viral internet status or national attention, neither of which is supportive of long term change. The attention span of the internet is measured in days, and there isn’t a single issue that gains national recognition that doesn’t ultimately become controversial and divisive. This idea, that widespread attention is required for progress, also discourages individual initiative because it indicates that the actions of a few are inadequate to solve a problem. 

This form of social discourse is effective at spreading information across vast groups of people, but it is completely ineffective for solving problems. There is a purpose for reporters and whistle-blowers, but there is not currently a need for more of them. Our society should not prioritize attention seeking. We should instead place more importance on the act of offering a solution, or even better, putting a solution into action and reporting the results. Raising awareness is good for collecting upvotes, retweets, and screenshots, but it is not good for much else. 

TL;DR 
Raising awareness of an issue is not a good way to fix the issue",14Oct2019,13

My parents always put their moral values of modesty and generosity over my happiness. 

I never fit in in middle school because I went to school in the same old clothes that wouldn’t accommodate my growing hips. 

I remember crying every morning when I woke up and would try to put on my child sized jeans from KOHLS and they would fit around the legs but not around the hips. 

My mom would just tell me to lose weight because I wasn’t getting clothes from “trashy” places like Ralph Lauren, J Crew, and Abercrombie like the rest of my classmates.

Meanwhile my parents were donating all of their money to charities. 

When I got to high school people started telling my mom that I was becoming so beautiful. My mom intensified her efforts.

I was called immoral for wearing skirts above my knees. She’d pinch my hips and boobs when I wore dresses. 

I realized I can’t do anything right so I started building my Instagram and Tik Tok presence and got enough followers to start promoting things.

That gave me money to start buying adequate makeup and clothes from places like Urban Outfitters and PacSun. 

I even saved up to get my first LV bag and my mom flipped out. That’s when the abuse got worse and I’d start recording her screaming at me and put it on Instagram. 

I thought I just wanted to end it all and then this guy(25M) reached out with a screenshot of my post and was like “ hey are you ok?” 

He told me that his parents are like mine and that we can talk whenever. So I started talking to him about everything and he would listen and always knows just what to say to make me feel better. 

He said that I’m too good for my parents and that my mom is just jealous of my youth and beauty.

He started inviting me out to eat at swanky restaurants. One day he took me to help me glow up my Instagram and I ended up taking a picture in fishnet stockings, high heels, and a cropped puffer jacket with no bra underneath.

That got me followers but made my classmates start calling me slut so I was having a tough time in school. 

My grades were suffering and he said I should meet his wife(26F) because her firm was looking for a secretary. 

I was afraid that she would think I was interested in her guy but she was nothing but warm. She even took me shopping for lingerie that she said would make me even sexier.

One night I went partying with both of them and ended up being given an orange and pink pill. Which made me obsessed with touching thighs and chests and I think I ended up rubbing against both of them but they said it was no big deal to let loose.

The next day my mom found out about my partying and said I was no longer allowed to Instagram and said she regrets giving birth to me and that I’m no longer a part of the family. 

I called them in tears and they said that I could move in with them. They said they’d love for me to be the wife’s secretary and that we could figure out what I would do in terms of rent.

So I’m packing my bags right now and by tomorrow my parents will get their wish.",14Oct2019,1

19,"Some background; I’m 26 and was diagnosed with End Stage Renal Disease on my birthday, June 2. I’ve been doing home dialysis for about a month following in clinic hemodialysis. How’d this happen? Well for the past 7 years I’ve been fighting and dealing with a chronic pain that hits me whenever it wants with no notice. My episodes are as follows: excruciating, rolling on the floor, feels like I’m dying pain that lasts for 10-12 hours with intense fever, and as if every nerve in my body is firing off with pain. The only that has seemed to somewhat help, morphine. 

After all these years I finally got genetically tested and turns out I have a super rare, 1 in 100,000 men, disease that attacks several vital organs plus pain and fever and nausea whenever. So that’s where my kidney issues come from. There is no cure for the disease but a way to “control” it. My body has been out of wack since I can remember. My core body temperature doesn’t regulate itself properly, my normal temp is between 98-100 Fahrenheit so I’ll randomly get burning hot or ice cold randomly. I can’t seem to gain weight properly, I’m 125 and 5’10” in height so I’m about 40 pounds under weight, plus the esrd doesn’t help my inability to gain weight. 

I don’t make plans because who knows if I’ll feel fine tomorrow or in an hour or a week. I don’t go out as much since my dialysis sort of anchors me to home a bit. My self esteem has dropped so low that I want a gf but then I tell myself who would want to deal with someone like me with a list of problems? I’ve missed countless family events and holidays due to the random pains. Been to the ER more times than I can count on 1 hand just to get morphine to give me a break from the pain. At once point, my blood pressure was border line heart attack from the pain I was in. 

I’ve had to put school off for a very long time and I haven’t worked on 2 years because of the sporadic flare ups of pains that cost me my last job. I’ve just been all over the place. At one pint during a horrible episode of pain, I told God that if it was my time to go then he should take me just to stop the pain. I feel silly saying that again but that’s the extent of which my pain has driven me. My family can only stand by and watch as I curl up in a ball and cry until I dehydrated myself. My friend describe the situation as if I were in a car accident but there’s nothing you can do but stand there and watch as I suffer. 

I want to do so many things but I as soon as I feel like I have a break from the pain or I get some energy, my thoughts ruin that. I want a gf, it’s been about 3 years since my last one but who wants to care for a 26 year old. I’m still waiting to begin the treatment for my disease but even at that, my kids will most likely be born with the mutation and I can’t even imagine having a child go through what I’ve been through. 

Of course by no means do I assume my situation is the worse because well it could be a lot worse but my reality has been molded around all this. As much as I try to not victimize myself by all this, my pessimism seems to get the best of me. I was depressed for a few months when this was all new to me and I’d like to think that I’m out of that phase but at night when everyone is asleep and I’m alone with my thoughts, it tends to creep up again. 

Just thought this place would be somewhere to voice out what I’ve been feeling. Thoughts? Comments? Question?

I visualized an index card and wrote “buy zucchini” on it, and pasted on my imagined zucchini, then imagined opening up my cranium and inserting the index card into my brain matter and closing my skull again. Then just now I remembered that there was something I needed to remember, so I visualized opening up my skull and BOOM: immediately I think “**BUY ZUCCHINI 🥒**”. It worked! I’m too lazy to go out and buy a zucchini as it’s night again now, but this is so cool, it’s literally a new aspect of human consciousness that wasn’t previously open to me.

27,"I'm not going to let the disgusting people in this world ruin my compassion for others.

Humans are beautiful.

We have stories and we talk to each other. We are all glued to this ball of dirt that's wirling through the cosmos.

We are all brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, aunts and uncles, neices and nephews.

We love music and animals and our breath does something stupid when we laugh. 

We all know a funny Joey, a cool Steve, a chill Todd, a loving Sheryl, and a sweet Sarah.

We all know people whose mannerisms we almost can't stand, but we love them to death anyway. 

We all know people who are going through tough trials. You just want to hug them and tell them that they mean everything to you. That you'll always be there for them.

Smiles are beautiful expressions. And humans master the smile. I love when a human smiles. It puts a smile on my face.

I love respectable men and women. People who do their part and inspire others to do the same. A man who takes care of this household, a girl who aspires to live her dreams, a woman who loves what she does, a boy who works hard to earn his honor.

I love the elderly.

Have you ever sat down and talked to an elderly person? They're full of stories. Elderly ladies are some of the most beautiful people I've ever met.

They'll tell you about their day. They'll tell you about their pets, their kids, their grandkids, their life experiences, their past dreams and accomplishments. They're angels.

We get so caught up in hating the world and all that's wrong with it. But we need to stop sometimes, and reflect on what it is that keeps us going. On what it is we love about our home and the people we meet.

I'll end this with a quote from Dead Poets Society:

"".. we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. Medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for.""",14Oct2019,4

29,"I live in New York. We are beginning to feel the chill in the air. It’s reminding me of all the worst memories of last year. How lonely and isolated I felt in my apartment, because raging storms made it impossible to go outside. How the wind scratched at my face and seeped down to my bones. How I had to cover myself in multiple layers to go outside, even if it’s just to the mailbox; like preparing to enter a war zone. How dead and depressing all the trees looked. I work as a cart pusher, and a blizzard would not stop my store from closing. I remember feeling like the last person on earth in that empty parking lot, surrounded by nothing but drab, hazy gray for as far as the eye can see.

I often fantasize about moving somewhere like California, but they call it a fantasy for a reason. Sorry, this doesn’t really have any resolution. Winter just gives me huge anxiety and it’s worsened by knowing that it’s coming fast and I can’t stop it. I think this death season would be easier to cope with if I had friends to tough through it with. I don’t really have friends—-none that I regularly hang out, anyway. I just wish I could skip straight to May. (And that’s another thing: the last few years, our winters seemed to be getting longer. They’ve stretched on well into April.

34,"I thought I was ok for a while there. I had deluded myself into believing that being like this and settling for mediocre looks, career, relationship would turn out different somehow. All this because I thought I could rely on a guy. Time and time again the lesson has always been that I shouldn’t base any of my actions, self worth, validation and whatever else on a guy. This time I thought it wasn’t like that. He was my best friend, probably the closest I’ve ever come to getting to know a guy. I felt like I could tell him everything. I felt like he was a genuinely good guy. He listened to me. He was the only one I could cry in front of. He was there when I was in a shitty relationship with someone and he was there when that person broke things off. I remember when we first met. It was probably the best date I’ve ever been on. We met up for breakfast by the beach and walked along the shore as we got to know each other. I had to leave after that but somehow we managed to meet up again later that night. I took him to a spot I loved. It overlooked the city and somehow the stars and the city lights mingled together and there we were on a bench in the dark kissing. It was like I was in a movie, and even as he kissed the back of my hand as we said goodbye for the night and thought of how cheesy it seemed, he felt like the personification of all my hopeless romantic girl brain could ever hope for. Going into it I knew it’d never turn into a relationship. He lived a thousand miles away and I just didn’t see us working out. He wanted to focus on his career and I honestly had no idea what I wanted, from life, love or anything. Surprisingly we kept talking. We’d talk late at night and I had started to become so comfortable with him that I told him every single thing about me and he accepted all of it without any judgement. A couple of months later I told him I was starting to see someone in my area, he understood and still wanted to stay friends. Fast forward to 2 years later and here we still are, meeting up twice a year if we can but always reminding each other it’s just as friends, no strings attached. This year I flew to where he was and I met his family. They know we’re really good friends, I know we’re really good friends, but somehow in between meeting his parents and spending days together falling asleep in each others arms, I had started to think that maybe I should just stop looking because here he was and this all felt perfect. Of course that crossed my mind. I still knew where we stood on things though, this was us being friends and the intimacy was just to keep the loneliness away. He kept saying how great it was that I was there, he kept giving me this look like he was just savoring this moment that I was there with him. He talked offhandedly about me moving there. “What if you lived here? We could do this all the time”. I smiled and said maybe. As we lay on the bed the night before I had to leave he said “ I basically love you, you’re my best friend. I’ve never been this close to anyone” and I told him I felt like that too. Every time we had to say goodbye I said the same thing I always had “That’s just the way it is sometimes”. I knew, somewhere in there he loved me, just not enough to be with me. Not enough to pluck up the courage and just ask. So now we’re back to the way things are, apart. I think it’s pretty pathetic that what broke this small hope that maybe someday we’d end up together was him commenting on a picture a friend of mine had. “Beautiful” he said and somehow this jealous part of me thought of how he’d never commented on my pictures. How despite him telling me I looked good I still felt inadequate and insecure. None of this has anything to do with him. It’s me. I really have a long way to go to fixing myself and despite this desperate part of me wishing a guy can fix all of this for me, I just don’t wanna wait for that anymore. I need to own up to all of this and find a way to love and see myself the way I desperately want someone else to, I think that’s the problem. I keep thinking even as I’m writing this now that in a way, I had to hurt like this because otherwise the lesson wouldn’t have been as clear. I just have to remember, the pain is helping me grow.

Me and my sis got good grades (a+) and they were failures at everything including learning. Not even something as simple as washing dishes.

It escalated and one of them turned ""good"" and we basically have now.
Not much has changed. But I had an realization, the title of the post was my realization. If they had not been there to: do all the chores
Make everyone mad everyday etc
I would of had more to do instead of just
Minecraft all day. I would be less fat I would be more happy and have a better relationship with my lil sis and I would have benefited from the attention I would get.

38,"I'd never seen LOTR before.

I was watching it for the first time, with one of my best friends, and my (first) girlfriend, yesterday.

When I met him, I was significantly underweight, addicted to opiates, booze, any drug I could get my hands on. I was depressed, suicidal. A nihilist, no belief in anything whatsoever. That was six or seven years ago.

Today? I've converted to Christianity, I started lifting and gained 50 pounds of muscle, quit all drugs and nicotine, got an amazing girlfriend, repaired my relationships with my family. I got fucking jacked, grew a beard and grew my hair out. 

I don't think my friend thought anything when he said that. But it meant so, so much. I don't expect much validation because why would I? I don't deserve anything for doing the bare minimum of survival. I was almost opiated death number whatever, and yet, I wasn't. I tossed aside the Ring and picked up the Cross, and the barbell.",14Oct2019,6
39,"Dear self, happy birthday. :)

Life has given you a lot of ups and downs, maybe more downs, but still, you've made it. You're currently surrounded by good people, friends, family. They've all wished you a happy birthday. Remember a year ago, on this day? You weren't smiling as bright. You weren't laughing as much. See, life gets better. Like you've always told yourself, it's better now. You're in a better place now. 

I wish I could've told you, a year ago, that some things aren't so important in life. Marks, for example. Looking back, they don't seem to significant, right? Back then, you thought exams were tough. It's alright now, right? I'm glad you took some time to reflect. I'm glad you reached out for help. I'm glad that you've grown even tougher. You've made it through, you've made it 'till now.

Right now, I would say I'm living life as I should've all my life. I'm relaxing, hanging out, reading, gaming, and taking time to think. These pleasures couldn't have happened a year ago, when you wouldn't have enough time for such activities. Back then, it was always exams, study and stress. It was sad, but I'm happy you've changed.

Now, don't look back in the past. Do whatever you want, you're still young. Have fun, enjoy life. Life is always about the simple, small pleasures, isn't that right? Keep your head up, shoulders straight, and you'll be all set to face the world.

I'm glad that you've met people who care for you. I'm glad that these people stay up to 12am just to wish you happy birthday. I'm glad that you have such friends who write long, and short, dedication messages. I bet tomorrow, when you head back to school, there would be birthday presents waiting for you. I'm so, so glad. 

Isn't it all lovely? Life sure has changed for you.

My best birthday wishes,

yourself. :)",14Oct2019,5
40,"Being alone is starting to get to me. 
I’m still going through a divorce from an abusive and toxic man. I’ve cut off all of my old friends and family that were toxic and users. I have a friend across the state and a neighbor but we aren’t that close. Most days I feel less than human. I don’t connect with most people because I find it exhausting and trivial. It’s hard listening to other people when you have the weight of the world on you. I know no ones problems are trivial but it’s hard listening to them all the time. I’m sure I’m still trying to heal and unlearn the abusive patterns 

I’ve been trying really hard to heal from my ex and my childhood. I can’t afford therapy but I do my best and try to stay positive.

I’m frustrated living in one of the most expensive city’s in the US. I live on my own with a car note, insurance and expenses that I can never seem to catch up with. I’m a student so I have no choice but to work in a line of work that I hate but is flexible enough to go to school. I started the semester with 5 classes and dropped down to 2 so I could work more. I decided to stop pursuing a career as a physician which helped take some pressure off of me. Now I feel like I’m floating and on the wrong track. Everything feels ambiguous right now. I’m just really fucking tired, sad, and horribly alone. I’ve been trying to be positive and keep working and praying for better days. All I can think about is no one would know or miss me if something happened so maybe it’s for the best. Maybe this is all my life was suppose to amount to.",14Oct2019,1
41,"This is going to be a long and cluttered post, I apologize. I posted this on another community but I need help...


Honestly, I don't know where to start. Ever since I was young I've had a lot of emotional trauma. I can remember being six years old sitting outside of my home with my mom as she cried because my dad left us. Eventually ended up not paying for the mortgage on the house we lived in (even though he promised) and we got kicked out and lived with my grandma for about two years. I visited my dad briefly throughout the years. He is a truck driver and when he gets loads to visit we would be lucky to have a day with him. I would visit every summer and every other Christmas over 1,000 miles away but ultimately never got close with him. That didn't effect me until I got older.


.


After the two years of living with my grandma my mom found a boyfriend. They ended up getting married when I was about ten years old. They were together for two years before getting married and we moved in with him before marriage because my mom got pregnant. Anyway, he wasn't perfect but he was a real father figure, although my father was still in the picture.


.


 I had my first suicidal thought at 10 years old.


.


 The first one I can clearly remember is seeing a butcher knife in my kitchen and wonder why I don't just stab it into my arm. I never acted on such nasty thoughts until I was 14 when I began cutting myself. Honestly, I was sad as fuck. An administrator found out I was cutting myself and of course told the guidance counselor who called my mom and stepdad. Of course they did something about it. I went to a therapist but it was super short lived and I stopped cutting. 


.


Until I was 16. When I was 15 almost 16 I found this girl that really changed my life. I liked her a lot and ended up catching some serious feelings for her. Two months after dating, come to find out my mom found out my stepdad was cheating on her on Christmas day 2015. I was over 1,000 miles away and it broke me. Ruined me completely. It broke my mom... her second failed marriage. She is so sad and so lonely it kills me. 


.


Anyway, this girl and I continue dating and she truly helps me get through this. In about February of 2016 things get rough between her and I though. We are young and don't know how relationships are suppose to work. We become jealous, spiteful, and just straight up toxic for each other. She would mentally and emotionally abuse me. Message ex's and then delete the message or wouldn't let me see them. She would break up with me to hangout with people she liked only to come back to me knowing I would take her back. There was one instance where I was hit in the back of the head with a straightener and I cried but she didn't seem to care much. That lasted until I was freshly 18, but by 17 I was already numb to her tricks.


.


By that I mean I didn't feel things. I didn't feel love the same, I didn't feel sad anymore. I genuinely became so numb after years of staying up all night crying, just to go to school and be miserable all day. I have this one specific memory where I was sitting up in bed, with the moonlight shining through the window and my life was genuinely like a movie. Me crying hoping I could get over this. When I said that I didn't mean I wanted to be numb. 


.


Through that relationship I grew up a lot and stopped caring what people thought of me, but what came with that was numb. Which is the part where I need advice on. 

.


I get sad of course, I won't ever deny that. What's the issue though is that I find myself getting over saddening things extremely quickly, almost too quickly. I absolutely cannot cry for more than three minutes, I can be sad and sniffling but physically tears won't come out of my eyes anymore. And it's almost like I reach this sadness limit and I just become numb. Can't cry, can't be sad, it's just a complete emptiness. 

.



Most of the time, even when I'm alone, I can't cry more than like three tears before I hit that limit. But when it gets really bad, I only cry for literally three minutes and then I can't anymore. I can't feel sadness and this emptiness isn't better. I can be happy and I can be frustrated but sadness just seems to really make me stop feeling anything. 


.



Then the emptiness last for so long. I am happy most of the time, genuinely. When I need to feel something else I just can't and get into this weird nothingness state. I need to feel other emotions so i remember that I'm not a robot or some shit. I need to let out this lurking sadness but I physically and mentally won't allow myself, even if I want to. 


.


I also haven't found a love as deep and strong as that girl. I've had plenty of other S/O's but I cannot feel love the same. I don't have feelings for the girl anymore, it's been over a year and a half and I could absolutely never see myself being with her again but damn man, when I loved her I loved her to my max and it ruined me. How do I feel sadness and get this build up of darkness out of me? I am done being empty when I just want to cry and let myself be sad for more than ten minutes. Please help.",14Oct2019,0

so here we go when i was a young kid about 9-10 i was in elementary school like any other kid there it never really striked me that i was a child with no father figure in the house because of my uncle and my grandpa and I lived with my mom my grandma and grandpa and my uncle and my aunt so we were a big family and I really never just thought of my father at the time cause i was young then a yeah through out highschool my first year in fact there were family days and a ton of family activities and family events there it was a catholic school to and none of my family members could really go even my mom and I understood she had work but a few kids at my school at the time was asking me where my parents were I just simply told them that my mom was at work and when they proceded to ask about my dad i really had nothing to say but i don't know him and that made me think who is my dad how come i've never met him or even no one in the family talks about him and when I got home i asked my mom where is my dad she was suprised at the time and said the truth to me and she stated that my dad left me when i was in my mother's belly when she got impregnated and me at the time of my early teens I just accepted the fact of that my father never realy wanted me and at the time as well i did not realize that my mom and my grandparents love me so much to and im happy to know that now because iv'e been a total piece of shit kid who in my teens fought alot of people even tho they gave me all their attention and all of their love but i was to young to notice at the time and kept getting sent to detention got into fights purely because i wanted them to give me more attention i know im a stupid fk for not thinking and using my head at the time then came someone in my moms life that a person she loves and i appreciate right now as my step father who cared for me and my lil brother they have and my stepbrother who was the child of my step father in a previous relationship where his wife died back to me being a kid who fights alot in my home town my mom got married and we soon moved for a year in my dads place in laguna Philippines and i was bullied alot in my year there in school there but i thought none of it because if my mom is happy im happy for her and that's what i thought at the time me being the stupid kid only got worse as i would get into more fights just to protect my self back then there then after a year of that being a stress in for my mom we moved back to our home town in the Philippines which i was happy about because i had friends here and people i know to bad i didn't go back to my old school and i transferd to a school where i don't know anyone for a year i got bullied and didn't fight back just so my mom could have a peace of mind

45,"As I stand at this moment, I am a college graduate with two bachelors degrees. This is one of the things in my life that I personally take great pride in. I’ve spent years pushing myself to focus. Every accomplishment I’ve made in my life makes me feel as though I’m going to do great things with my life. But I always wonder, if I were to take ADHD medicine could I do even better in my life? When I was in grade school I was diagnosed with ADHD and have noticed my entire life that my ability to focus was subpar... I always feel myself day dreaming and drifting whenever I read or write. My parents never gave me medicine for ADHD, rather they gave me some vitamins they found at shop rite, they I assume to be nothing placebo pills. As they never really helped with anything.

My current predicament that I’m bored, and I’m starving for more in my life. I’m itching to go back to school, earn my master, maybe even go for a doctorate. However, I’m worried about my ADHD tripping me up. While going for my bachelors, I literally needed to push myself to do the simplest things, mainly out of a sever lack of focus. I knew I wanted my degrees and I knew the only way to earn them was doing the work and forcing myself to focus focus focus, despite my antsing around.

I really feel like if I were to get on a medicine that works, my attention to detail would improve... I’m just kinda worried...

I’m writing this letter for closure because it apparently helps and as a goodbye. I don’t even know where to start. I love you. Haha. I’m really bad at showing my emotions and talking about them. Sorry I never told you. Well I don’t know if I should be sorry. I just kinda hoped you knew.

Geez, we have a long history and it’s all messy. I remember when I first talked to you, I thought you were so funny, charismatic, I frickin loved talking to you, it was always so damn interesting.

B, I was jealous of you and I always looked up to you. I really wanted to be like you but as we grew up, I realised you weren’t the same person anymore and I wasn’t the same kid. I always felt like I could never catch up to you. But now it’s just so different. I really wanted you to acknowledge me and I always wanted your approval.

Maybe that’s why I wanted to have sex with you so badly. Because I wanted to feel like we shared something and had something to connect us forever. You were my first, I’ll never regret that, I only wanted it to be with you. And even now me thinking about having sex with any other guy is impossible for me to think or want.

Over the years we started to speak less, we were more intimate, saw each other more but we were more distant. We didn’t share the same conversations we used to. I don’t think I can ever get over you but that’s ok. I don’t know if it seems or seemed like I don’t or didn’t care but I truly do. I just don’t know what the right thing to do is and I don’t want to risk doing anything I’ll regret. I hope you can somehow understand. I don’t really know what to write, I just wish you could know how I truly feel about you, it’s not really something I can write in words, more of a emotion. 

I hope you find happiness. Goodbye.",14Oct2019,36
50,"Following the recent revealing of various horrible things done by an ex friend (and for a period ex-romantic partner), it has become clear that I (23F) was completely emotionally manipulated by him and used, lied to and had the wool pulled over my eyes about who he was. 

I sent a strong and composed message standing up for myself and acknowledging that what he had done was wrong and I would no longer associate with hum, I have blocked him on everything. I am having to deal with the loss of a friend, potential romantic partner, realisation that I have been manipulated and feeling of loss of power. 

This comes at a time when I am very unsure of myself, my aspirations and future and I feel the desire to be inherently strong about all of the above, despite it being deeply distressing and making me question my own power/worth/esteem.

I guess I'm just looking for advice on how to maintain my power in a situation and circumstance where I had it taken away and overall feel better about the loss, as well as dealing with uncertainty about myself and future.  I want validation that I walked away from the situation holding my power but I know that this cannot come from him.

52,"Throwaway.

I work two part time jobs. One is M-F, 4 hours a day, and then in the afternoon, I work from home as an independent contractor. I also run a small hobby business on the side, which I really enjoy, but doesn't bring much money in. 

I don't hate my jobs. But I'm struggling with the feeling trapped in my M-F day job. 4 hours isn't that long, and the job isn't hard. I just hate having to be there. Before I picked up this job, I was only working from home, and I loved not having a supervisor expecting me to show up. Now, every morning, I have to get up at 5 am to get there before 7, and it's the same tasks, every day, over and over again. Again, nothing about this job is difficult, it's just tedious.

I don't make very much money at this job, and at certain points of the year, I could be making more from my work at home job. I pretty much took this day job to make tax season easier (so I don't end up owing as much from the contractor work). Plus, when my contracting job slows down (usually over the summer), I'll still have income. I just dread going in every day, for the simple fact that I have no choice but to be there, if that makes sense.

I made the mistake of mentioning this to my SO. He is a work horse (in fact, he put in 26 hours of overtime this past week) and will do any job, any time, any place, no matter how sucky it is. I admire that. He sees me as a ""head in the clouds"" type when I start complaining about my work. And he's right. 4 hours of manual labor a day plus the desk job in the afternoon is nothing. His opinion is one of the things keeping me in this job... I don't want him to think I'm irresponsible or lazy.

This day job is not something I see myself doing forever. I have no benefits or anything. I want to quit. But I feel like everyone will look at me like I'm a spoiled, lazy brat if I do. I just miss being able to take my time in the mornings, have alone time throughout the day, work at my own pace, and still have time to do the things I love, like tend to my hobby business, go to the gym, and maintain the house. With this job, I don't have time or energy for any of those things any more, and it's slowly dragging me down.

I can’t hate you and I can’t stay mad at you. I don’t have that in me... But you probably despise me. The way I broke up, it was cowardly. I told you we were done, and left. My mental health was suffering too much. I was putting you over my constantly and it led to me having severe eating problems, sleep deprivation, and high anxiety causing me to throw up at work. I don’t blame you. You didn’t ask for me to do that. I did that on my own and I wish I realized what I was doing because it just... it just felt so awful when I wanted things to feel amazing. 

I hadn’t seen you in a good month. For a non-long distance relationship that’s still somewhat long. You had mono, you had plans. Yeah, I get that, I had plans too. But not even once did you offer me to come over. All I wanted was to see you again. And hold you and tell you I love you to your face and not through text on a screen. But that never happened. And slowly your anger issues started to show more and more. You got irritated at the smallest things, when I wasn’t even trying to say or do something that would set you off you would go off anyway. 

You’d put me down for trying to be the best that I could. Granted, I was always going about it the wrong way. I should have just been patient and understanding. But hell, it’s too late for that now. 

I’ve never felt more alone. Not even my friends check up on me. It’s starting to feel like complete isolation. When I move out from my parents, who will I have left? 

God everything feels so awful but at the same time I have moments where I feel happy. Therapy is slow. I’ve become bulimic, I can’t eat properly, when I do I overeat and throw it all up. I’ve been smoking weed constantly to forget about everything, to pull myself away from the numbness for even just an hour. But it’s starting to become less enjoyable and less effective. 

I just want someone to ask me how things are going, even when things seem fine. I want someone to pull me aside and tell me that I’m enough and to hug me. I just want anyone to tell me that I don’t have to feel like this anymore. I don’t _want_ to feel like this anymore.",14Oct2019,4
65,"Sorry, just thought I’d go on a little rant about this space-time metric. 

I turned 20 on the 6th this month. It’s quite hard to believe I’ll be allowed to purchase alcohol next year. I can imagine vividly my first day of high school. And spending time in classes, wishing I was elsewhere.

Since my mid teens, I’ve been longing for the ability to be self sufficient and stable by my mid to late twenties (making a good enough income to support myself, and perhaps a family, and be able to travel). Although still very much so in the realm of possibility, I just imagine this is what it’s like to be somebody living without direction (like my brother). He is 22, and he’s been basically a couch surfing / homeless drug addict since 18. I can picture him still lost 20 years later, which sounds far away but I know it’s not. 


I love playing video games. I always have since I was young. But I’m fearful that the time I put into them (even these days) are slowly taking away from time I could be putting into something else to make my future more secured, and more of what I want. In fact, that is what’s happening. 


Maybe this will be relatable to some of you. I’ve been thinking about writing a book about time, for some time - perhaps I should see where I end up first.",14Oct2019,3
66,"I’m excited. This decade sucked, I had severe depression for a few years. I moved countries when I was around 10, and I’m a senior in college today.

I went back to church about three years ago and it’s been a huge blessing. My faith is flourishing once again, slowly but surely. I will probably get downvoted to oblivion, but I just need to scream into the void. I love Jesus, and for the first time in a long time I am starting to think I love people.

I want to master an art form and fall in love with it. Music didn’t work out for me, but me and God vibe so we can redeem that. I want to master photography and express myself through it so hard that it’ll inspire people. I want to turn my wasted youth into something beautiful. I want to bring glory to God with my craft.

I live in Texas and when the weather gets below 80 (which is cold for us) I start getting all scared and skittish because it reminds me of bad times, of stuff that happened in previous falls/winters because usually this is the time of the year when my depression has gotten worse. I’m trying my hardest for it to be different this year.

From me realising too late that she was making me jealous on purpose, make me think I wasnt intelligent, and her putting herself above me when she was in a bubble being protected by mum and dad oblivious to the real world, anyways.

Fuck people like that, I started speaking to a girl, not going out with her YET, but she came to my world as soon as I broke up with this woman, I dont know If you believe in fate, or that things happen for a reason but hell of a coincidence.

71,"I was in an abusive relationship for 3.5 years. I just ended it and haven’t shed a tear.

19 and coming out of a dark place, I met you. We’d briefly met once before and had mutual friends. Things were fun in the beginning. I think we both changed each other though, me for the worse and you for the better. 

Little things you did bothered me but I was so enamored with you I let a lot slide. You took an insecure, lonely girl and made her feel accepted. Not confident, not strong, not beautiful, not loved, and not a like a woman but a kept girl. Hindsight is 20/20 though.

This was my first real relationship. The first time I perceived unconditional love and the first time love scarred me this deep.  

The first time I left, you went off the deep-end and I fell for your manipulation and insane pleading. All my insecurities were your ammunition... Despite options and people telling me no, I went back to you. 

The gaslighting was just the start. A constant barrage of “you’re arrogant”, “that never happened”, I can’t believe you’re making this up”, “why do you always twist things in your head?”.  The 4 times you put your hands on me my mind had already become accustomed to blocking it out and moving on. Even when you pinned me against the wall and screamed at me I was just a disgusting wh—e and wasn’t assaulted. File it away, keep your head down, keep moving. Like you said, “Don’t be a quitter”. 

The late night arguments and a couple bruises from gripping me so tightly. Then the way you held me softly while I cried over our lives... only to bring it up later as me being “too sensitive”. I have a habit of pushing buttons and I always made excuses for your over the top reactions. I’m done seeking that deep growth and development. 3.5 years and your growth has been minimal. 

The worst feels so long ago but I’m waking up now. I can see clearly through you. I could see us “happy” and together if I squinted and that’s partially what kept me in it so long. But I don’t want to live a half-life, I want to feel everything and love with eyes wide open, experience the world with excitement and true joy, not a watered down version to accommodate your inadequacies. 

Honestly, I’m afraid that in opening up to someone new and facing the knife of rejection like I never have before; that the most excruciating points of my past will continue to cause me hurt. Being pretty on the outside doesn’t make suffering any less on the inside. 

The downside to a good memory is remembering the way people made you feel your worst; how each little word carved a deep cut on your soul. Pain is a lot easier to recollect than pleasure and the last 5 years have been filled with pain- emotional and physical. 

There’s a voice in my head nagging I’m not good enough. It’s far too easy to believe it. I went so long taking care of you and never nurturing myself. You took all of me because I was the best you ever had, a fluke. All the red flags: your friends lack of motivation, your living circumstances, employment, the jealousy, possessiveness, manipulation, lack of empathy, inability to be happy for my successes, removing me from my family and friends, arguing always became a character assassination using secrets I trusted you with, not letting me leave, hitting my car and walls out of anger, grabbing me.... There were a lot but young and naïve I didn’t listen. 

My body and it’s scars, my overly pensive mind, my melancholia, the things I’ve said I’d do and never did, my past decisions, my disorder, my constant need to be on the go but being unable to...I don’t even know how to explain to a love interest that at 23, I have a degenerative condition and could totally lead a long, happy, relatively normal life but have to be careful how much I exert myself in certain activities, prove my physical pain exists, and explain that an ibuprofen isn’t going to cut it.

I worry for you and what’ll happen in your life but I know now that I am not responsible for you or your success/failure. Now at 23, I understand not everyone can be saved from themselves. 

I’m afraid of never finding wholesome love but now I am free. I love myself again and that will do for now.",14Oct2019,13
72,"Yesterday, my girlfriend and I were together. She gave me head and all of that fancy stuff. I came. Then about 40 minutes later, we decided to try sex. I did not have a condom and this was extremely dumb of me. We were both virgins with very limited time, so I could only get the head of my penis in. I did not come in her, however I’m worried about my precum. I did not pee in between, so it likely had sperm in it. In total, I was probably only actually in her for about 10 or 15 seconds and I kept wiping off the head of my penis to get the precum off, if it matters any.

73,"Today is my 20th birthday and I'm feeling very emotional. 

I have lived my whole life wanting something ""more"" but now I just feel extremely unaccomplished and lacking, its become very clear that I have spent 20 years pursing academic achievements, and other than that I have done almost nothing. Theres an entire part of me that I haven't gotten the chance to meet, because I have been following a path I don't want to be on (but I can't get off without throwing away my future).

I've always been very impulsive and impatient, I have always just done what I want to do when I want to do it. I've been very against doing anything that doesn't bring immediate happiness and now that, I am here, living a life I don't want to live and doing nothing to change it; I feel very rutted and frankly very depressed. 

I feel that everyday I am becoming more bitter and unkind, I'm losing the parts of myself that I used to pride myself on. 

I am growing apart from people I love and thats one of the most painful things I have ever experienced. 

Every morning when I wake up and look in the mirror I can see my face becoming slightly more aged, and I don't have a problem with getting old- I think age is a beautiful thing, but not when I have nothing to show for it. I feel like my youth and beauty is being wasted on books and studying and jobs that bring me no fulfillment. 

The thing is, I know what I want to do. I want to work with children in developing countries, I want to build language programs, I want travel and inspire until I have nothing left to give. I want to see heartbreaking things and do all I can do to help, I want to  be surrounded by love, I want to make art that heals me, I never want to loose the part of me that is sweet and understanding, I just never want to be stagnant the way I am right now, and school makes me feel stagnant- especially when I think about the fact that its not only two more years of undergrad, then it's two or three years of a masters and then exiled to cubicleland I go; to live one day on repeat for the rest of my life. 

I don't believe in regret, and I don't think that I have anything to regret up until this point of my life but  I do believe that I have potential (because everyone does) and yet I am actively watching myself let it go to waste.  I am watching myself stunt my creative pursuits, I am watching myself live a lukewarm life, I am watching myself be ordinary, and now I can't help but mourn the person that I see myself becoming more and more distant from every day.",14Oct2019,1

80,"Disclaimer: all the names are fake names. 

It's been 15 years that I've carried this secret and I don't know what to do about it. My mother took my sister and I with her to the south from the midwest, my dad stayed behind, and parents divorced when I was about 9 years old. It was at that age that I would receive that phone call that made me question everything about my life.

My mother was in her office on the phone when she called me over. She was on the phone saying ""no, I never saw anything happen... yes, she's here you can talk to her but she never told me she saw anything."" She handed the phone to me and said ""this is the police and they want to ask you a few questions about your cousin Leah and your dad so just answer honestly."" The cop on the line talked to me 

Cop: hi is this TW?
 
Me: yes

Cop: I need to ask you a few questions. Do you remember living at [one of my previous address]? 

Me: yes

(My mind is a little fuzzy in this next part, but I'm trying my best to remember)

Cop: Do you recall being in that house alone with just your father and cousin? 

Me: um... sometimes

Cop: when you were about 4 years old we were told there was an instance where you were you were in the living room and your father and cousin somewhere else in the house. Do you remember ever seeing anything happen between your cousin and father?

Me: like what?

Cop: just anything

Me: I don't know. I don't remember leaving the living room. 

Cop: ok, that's all I need to know. 

I handed the one to my mom and she told them ""yeah, see she doesn't remember anything. Yes, bye."" 

All I thought was that those were weird questions and I didn't know what was going on, but my mother explained to me :

Mom: so, the cops wanted to ask you questions because your cousin Leah said that your dad touched her inappropriately when she was 6 and you were only 4.

I was confused and by the look on my face I guess my mom could tell what I was thinking. 

Mom: ""Yeah, I don't think he did it either. I talked to him and he kept telling me that he never did that, plus, she only said it after Tia (leah's former step sister) her dad molested her, but answer me honestly, do you really not remember anything happening?""

Me: I don't remember... 

Her: and he's never done anything to you?

Me: No

Mom: ok, that's all I need to know

But even at that age, I had a few vague memories of being 4 years old. One of my cousin and my father. He used to hug me while I sat on his lap and play a game where I would try to get out of his hug. One day saw him do the same to my cousin, but I didn't think anything of it, other than ""oh hey, cousin is playing with dad too, I'm glad they're getting along"" and yes, that's seriously what I remember thinking. I didn't think it was anything bad, but being an adult now, I can see how that's shady.

From then on my mom kept telling me things like ""if any man tries to touch you, I don't care if it's one of your uncles or your dad. I need you to tell me right away."" 

Unfortunately, there was an incident with my step father at the time who did just that when I was 11. I still wasn't brave enough to tell my mother. After some time, I just decided to put behind me and just not tell anyone, except some strangers that I knew would just drift out of my life and forget what I said. I told my sister and it brought us close. 

We would visit our father in the summers and we would see our cousins too. There was always this tension and it made me mad. Somehow, I had convinced myself that it was just due to some sort of racial bias because my families are from two non-white different countries that tend to not get along. In my heart of hearts, I knew it wasn't that but I guess one could only cope with something like this at such a young age by pretending it's something else; the mind is such a powerful thing.   

Tensions would eventually get to the point where my cousin finally told me, very vaguely, about the incident. As adults, we never talked about it until one day she confronted my sister and I over Skype. She asked why we never asked her about it  and that she felt like we don't believe her because my mother doesn't believe her. My sister was just there awkward and uncomfortable, as was I. Cousin Leah told us that she hardly thinks about it anymore, but that every time that we come and our father was involved, it reminded her of what happened. The missing piece for me to make it real was just what happened to her exactly because I simply could not imagine my dad doing anything like that, he's been a good father to us, and he's never once made me feel uncomfortable. Then again I thought why would cousin Leah ever lie about this and for so long? 

My sister and I talked and cried about it after Leah hung up. My sister said that after she's been told this about father, she could never feel comfortable around him, she's scared of him and doesn't exactly have a reason, but she keeps thinking that he'll do something now and she doesn't want to. 

My father has turned into a wreck, lately. He's getting old and his lifestyle is catching up with him. He's always drank, but I've never seen him drink this much in front of us at least. The last time I remember, he was with his ex girlfriend and she told me her secret. She was going to have a kid with him, but said that she's old, her kids are grown, and how would she work and take care of the kid alone. In short, my father had given her money to abort the child because he didn't want anymore children. On top of that, he would disrespect this lady who was nice enough to let his daughters stay in her home in front of us. I was seeing this dark side of my father now and I felt like I wanted to gauge my mental eyes out.

My sister was frightened and I tried to comfort her but I don't think it helped. This was the time that we both discussed asking our father about what happened with our cousin. When we were watching TV with him or just sitting around, neither of us could muster the courage to ask. We are both in limbo and we don't know how to act. Even with all these things I learned about father, I still see him as my father and I still love him, but I feel like I need to know the truth. What happens if I have a daughter? What will I tell my partner? What would they think of him? I imagine they wouldn't want our daughter near him if they even suspected that he did this. My current partner I suspect is going to ask me to marry him. I feel like this might be something to say but I'm not sure it is. It's a secret I'm very tired of carrying. 

TL;DR: my father may have molested my cousin, but I have never been sure who to believe, even as an adult. I suspect it might be true, but I have trouble convincing myself. I'm tired of carrying this secret that my family put on my shoulders since I was 9 and I don't even know if my boyfriend should know about this before he proposes or potentially has kids with me.",14Oct2019,2

97,"I know the title doesn’t give away much, but my younger sister has decided to pursue a relationship with our stepbrother. Whenever I try to explain the situation, people already give me a weird expression or whatever, but my sister (Aly) has known our stepbrother (Damien) [all names replaced] before our parents married. Aly and Damien went to the same school and played the same section in marching band, hence why they knew each other beforehand. I know it’s weird to explain that my sister is in a relationship with our stepbrother, but I don’t know how else to explain it: I’m really concerned for both of them. What should I do???",14Oct2019,1
99,"I'm at home for the day and  I thought I was alone, so after watching a documentary of a paralyzed guy recording the house he was in getting destroyed I went to the kitchen and started talking to myself about it and how it must feel being him. His wife and child were crushed by a fallen chimney and I was going on and on about him being paraplegic. 

Then I heard a noise behind me. I snap my neck 180 degrees and there's my sister standing behind me in the hallway. We lock eyes then she quickly exits the house.

My sister is the type of person to not care much (probably got from me) so I'm hoping she forgets about it.",14Oct2019,1

102,"This happened yesterday, three days after my birthday and three days before our 1st anniversary. She was my first love, the first girl I have ever had a close connection with. We were perfect when we were physically together: super intimate and passionate, caring. I loved her so much sometimes I would cry right there and then. But there was a problem. Several, actually, but the main one happened whenever she was not near me. I was paranoid and anxious at first: I didn't trust her. That caused a lot of stress on me, especially during vacation. She attended the same school as me at the time, and I should've enjoyed it as much as I could. I felt down so many times for no reason as if tiny holes were forming in my heart out of the fear that she didn't love me, that I wasn't good enough.

Eventually, I learned that she was faithful and that I would not be traded. And oh boy, these months were the best of my life. I got to discover so many new things about her, and myself too. A whole new world had opened up, a new door swung open in front of me. It all ended when she called me saying that she was changing schools.

I was used to being close to her every day at school, having lunch together, and going to the same classes, even. The first two weeks with her away were fine. In my opinion, it was better than when she was at school - I could focus better and spend much more time with my friends, which was a blessing. After that, however, the paranoia started to kick in again. I couldn't see or feel her next to me, so every day my mind raced with thoughts about how she might've found someone better than me (just for context, my school is minuscule compared to hers). This didn't allow me to sleep. I resorted to writing: I wrote poems and prose at night when I couldn't sleep, with more passion than ever before (I used to write back then, too).

Some of the tension flowed out of me after I talked to her many times over the months, but much of it remained afterwards. It only dawned on me what was truly going on after I went to Rock in Rio with her. I had agreed to watch Drake live with her in Rio de Janeiro (we live in Brazil). I hated it, but it was worth spending time with her. The next day we were alone at the apartment which her parents borrowed for our stay in Rio. She wasn't very willing to do anything, not even kiss. I thought it was just her being tired from the concert, so I let it pass.

When visited her the next week at her house, she said the same excuse: ""I'm not in the mood"". That started to worry me because the same sentence followed for two more weeks, until this past one. She texted me saying she needed to talk to me about our relationship, and invited me to her house. It was a short stay. We talked about what each of us felt, and she said that my stress was contaminating her life. I agreed, hoping we could come with a solution. I noticed, nonetheless, that she wasn't willing to give one or even to help suggest one. I gathered myself up and told her that there was no problem if she wanted to break up, but no, she said she still wanted to be together. I knew she was lying. I was just waiting.

The next day at 6 pm she sent me a **text** saying how she didn't want to be with me anymore, and how she needed time for herself. Keep in mind, I had just returned from a school trip, where my birthday took place. I could barely go due to me having been infected with the flu after the Drake concert. Nonetheless, completely understandable.

But now I'm left alone with all the questions. When did she start feeling this way? Why didn't she tell me? Is it because of someone else? Don't get me wrong: her text was super nice and respectful. Both of us were very decent about the whole thing.

I still don't understand many things. I'm not special, and I'm sure many of you out there have experienced the same thing, if not worse. I just wanted to share that this is the greatest pain I've felt in my short life of 16 years.",14Oct2019,1
103,"I’m transferring departments tomorrow and my coworkers had a small going away lunch for me. My current manager said some kind words and thanked me for my service, then opened it up to anyone else who wanted to speak.  

The manager that hired me about 6 years spoke next. He talked about what I was doing for work prior to him hiring me, except it wasn’t my background he was describing. I was confused at first, then realized he was mistaking me for someone else that got hired at the same time, because he was describing her background. I just nodded and smiled, but was pretty mortified.  I guess I never made too much of an impression on him.",14Oct2019,1
104,So today I was talking to some people and the subject of ghosts came up. In Spanish we learned about la llorona and I said I didn’t believe in her. The I said something along the lines of fuck her I don’t believe in that bitch. And then one of the other people responded and said she’s going to come after you now. I’m really scared and I don’t know if I should be. I’ve talked to some people and they either tell me I’m stupid for believing I’m going to die and cuss her out to prove it. And the other group of people is telling me I’m going to die if I don’t pray and do something  good to make up for it. I’m really scared and need an outside opinion. I appreciate you for reading this and anything is helpful. Pray for me thanks,14Oct2019,1
105,"Title is self explanatory. I hate loud noises. I just can't with them.

They get on my nerves, especially when it's random noises with no synchronisation. If it's loud music, let's say that I can work with it. It doesn't really annoy me. 

But If I hear 15 pricks who don't want to pass the class shouting, singing and I don't know what in the world else, I can't. My temper is just..... ah. Concentration is not even expected anymore, I just wait until the teacher shouts and everyone shuts up. 

I've been in a loud class for 9 years of my life, ever since elementary school, and this is gonna be the 10th. I haven't got used to it. I **can't** get used to it. It boils my blood whenever it happens, and my mood is below zero after (and during) the break.

You don't wanna participate in class? Ok, you don't want to learn, you don't have the mood, you're tired, I get it. Don't. Make. Unessecary. Noise. Cause if 1 does noise, he is alone and stops. But if they are 2, they become 3, the 3 become 4 and so on. 

Just. Shut up :)",14Oct2019,1

Can someone please tell me what I should do? I want to learn mandarin, and I plan to get Duolingo for that. I want to explore cooking, but I never have time thanks to work and all the things I get distracted with. I have an interest in composing music, but can't find a program or the motivation. I love biking, but living in a city means I have to be extremely careful and can rarely bike, much less do it alone, or enjoy it. Does anyone have advice? A way to dive into these things without interfering with the rest of my life. Another hobby that is easy to find time for and enjoyable? I'm desperate.",14Oct2019,2
109,"Wasn’t sure exactly where to post this, but had some things to say.

Most people will see this and say, “well duh, I’d never hit/slap/kick etc. An actor, I understand” but it’s not just physical stuff that’s a no-no.

I get that people cope with fear differently- it’s actually pretty interesting to observe the types of people who come through the house. If you scream, flail your arms, run, laugh about being scared, or just smile and walk through, I like you.  

But if you: mock me, copy me, scream in my face (on purpose), laugh in my face, ask me stupid questions (“where are you from?” “How much do you get paid?”) or try to make me break character, you’re an asshole and all the actors hate you. Ditto goes for people who try to scare their friends (that’s my job!) or try to scare me (you didn’t- I’ve been sitting in this room for hours with all this scary stuff, your little “boo” did not scare me.).

Remember, you’re paying me to get in your personal space, you do not have the right to harass me and my coworkers.

I had a prop gun last night and someone mimed at me to shoot myself and laughed in my face. 

I’ve had many people copy my movements/laughs/screams. You’re not funny, you just look like an idiot.

People tell me “you’re not scary!!” And think they’re so cool. If you aren’t scared, good on you. I don’t give a shit. Keep moving. 

Also, depends on the specific house but: dont touch the actors. We can’t touch you, don’t touch us. I don’t mind if you think I’m fake and give me a poke, or if you freak out and accidentally hit me, but don’t touch your face against mine or push me when I get to close. Again, you paid to be here. Had a girl ask to give me a kiss on the cheek and let her because she asked so nicely! Consent is everything, folks. 

BONUS POINT: 

Move! Your! Ass! 
This isn’t a showhome, you don’t need to look at every prop and painting on the wall. It’s also not your buddy’s basement, please don’t sit on the furniture and reapply your lipstick or take selfies (and please don’t take a picture without asking the actors consent).

For the most part, people are lovely and are either scared or having a good time and appreciating the house. Just because you’re not scared doesn’t give you a free pass to harass the actors.",14Oct2019,75

115,"I have birthday today and to create some order within my thoughts (and get some sleep) I like to write some things down - maybe some of you can relate to it.


I never liked my birthdays. I dont know why but I think it is some kind of childhood trauma. I have never been one of the cool kids nor handsome nor likeable but more the nerdy almost creepy type which would come late to class to avoid being bullied by the other ones during the break between classes. To be honest I think even my parents and family held me somehow in contempt - my mother was somehow distant towards me and my father was not there working. 

What I lacked in soft skills I made up in intelligence and intellect. Not bragging but I was considered the "" beast of a brain"" by my class. However a mind can take some very dark paths in life if faced with serious adversity. 

After I left school I turned into a opposite person: Due to my suffering I created somekind of a ""tough mf"" attitude which was basically all that pain and suffering transformed into a stone hearted version of my former self - subduing my vivid inner life ready to crush any obstacles and people in my way to rise to the top of the food chain to never ever be that powerless as I once was. I turned into a charming person with sixth sense of recognizing power games and social dynamic. Deep inside of me the will of domination and wrath dwelled like a well of power I glady used to boost my rise from nothing to someone.

After many years of raising to the top (in form of status, looks, reputation and university) I was destined to be someone very great: My upbringing had me made the tough - a from rags to riches story. I was considered a top Student with a bright future and made my parents proud but actually i was consumed by wrath and hate - it just felt so good. After a night of heavy drug consuming (i develeop some serious drug Problems in university) I was merciless crushed as I suffered a major psychic breakdown which led nearly to killing myself since I could not bear the fact that even that I was sucedding that well for years something very elementary was not right within myself - i felt it but I could not name it. I realized that the my shell I had masterfully created was a burden too heavy to bear any longer. I will never ever forget that moment I realized that the shell is getting stripped away from me - it felt like falling into somewhere deep where space and time had no meaning. 

I went to a mental hospital and worked on my Problems. It is a long way to go still but i never felt so free in my life.

TL;DR: Don't let your wrath and anger consume you even if it is tempting to do so.",14Oct2019,1
117,I’m really struggling with depression lately and find it very hard to climb out of this deep dark hole I’m in. I guess I just need some reasons to keep going on.,14Oct2019,7
118,"I've been fighting depression for 5 years+ and YES I've ""seen someone"" and tried meds and everything else you'll probably suggest and not only has nothing gotten better, everything has *only* ever gotten worse. So much worse. I only wish I felt like I did when I first felt depressed or any point along the way because it's just been steadily downward. Never even a small spike of improvement, just a negative-sloped straight line.




If years and years of treatment and effort haven't worked I feel extremely certain that it'll never get better. For a lot of people it does, but for most of them it would have by now at least a little bit.",14Oct2019,1
