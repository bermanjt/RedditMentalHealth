1,"I love my mom so much because she can be extremely nurturing but she can be vicious most of the time. She snaps at my dad and my brothers and I over dumb shit like not ordering the pizza when she said. She has a fucking meltdown! And guess what? We got the pizza way before she expected it so it’s never a big ass deal. 

I rent an apartment and I mentioned wanting to buy a home to my mom and she immediately yelled “no! You’re not!” And I said “yyyeah I think I am” and she replied “no! No! My coworker and I just talked about how we’re not letting our daughters buy homes” like what?! If I was married with any man she would approve but she doesn’t because I’m single. What the hell gives? I can’t break ties with her becuas rod cultural things but I need to get away",06Oct2019,1
2,"Just read a story about the Chicago gang that killed a 9 year old boy. The get away driver pleaded guilty for a 25 year deal. Obviously these people are horrible, but that's just insanely long. He's gonna get out in 2044. How is anyone supposed to re-enter society after that long, especially after how badly they've supposedly been treated in US prisons. Norway has a max sentence of 21 years, and even that feels too long for a lot of the bad people. Just think of how fucking long that is. For many of us, it's the duration of our entire life. It doesn't feel like a productive system. A lot of these people just need another shot at life and instead they have the majority of their useful life taken away in a prison.",06Oct2019,0

5,"So, as many of you may be aware, a couple of months ago, I submitted a creepypasta on here about a lost episode of the Nickelodeon series ""iCarly"" where they parody the '90s horror movie ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"". Well, once I submitted it, I have been getting only a few comments on it, and almost all of them were not so positive. A couple of them claiming that my creepypasta is fake, and one asking how they could fit the parody into a 20-minute episode (or somewhere along the lines). Well, first of all, has there ever been a creepypasta, preferably a lost episode one, where the events happened for real? Was there in real life an episode of ""Blue's Clues"" where Blue dies in the hospital and a distraught and grief-stricken Steve commits suicide? Was there in real life an alternate version of the ""VeggieTales"" episode ""Where's God When I'm Scared?"" where Junior Asparagus dies? The answer to both of those questions are ""no"". So, how can a lost episode creepypasta be realistic? Where does the reality take place? It just makes zero sense. And second of all, as I stated in the comments, I never said that they parodied the whole movie. I mean, how did they fit it in, you ask? Same as with the ""Victorious"" episode ""The Breakfast Bunch"", which did not parody each and every scene in the movie ""The Breakfast Club"". Anyway, a couple of weeks after I submitted my creepypasta onto Reddit, it was featured in a video by a YouTuber called The Shadow Reader. Now, I never watched his telling of my iCarly creepypasta because I was kind of nervous because The Shadow Reader is known for reviewing the creepypastas that he's featured after telling them. Sometimes if a creepypasta is poorly put together, he'll end up harshly criticizing it, which is what I was worried he might've done with mine. I even saw in the comments of the video that there was no build-up to the story. Well, what was  I supposed to do the build up the story, mention every detail in the ""iCarly"" lost episode? I mean, in the story, the episode is literally parodying or copying the events of ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"". And how I was I supposed to end my creepypasta, saying that my character in the story took the computer and either threw it out the window, or smashed it to smithereens with a baseball bat, or even set in on fire in the backyard? I mean, you have to understand that I'm a noob in the creepypasta game. That's why you don't see very many creepypastas on my Reddit page. I mean, I'm no Stephen King or R.L. Stine, you can't just expect me to come up with a perfect scary story. I tried my best. Anyway, to anyone who watched The Shadow Reader's take on my ""iCarly"" creepypasta, how bad did he criticize it?",06Oct2019,1
6,"Specifically I'm talking about tools like Trello/Evernote/One Note

I personally can build my own software wise(granted they would not be nearly as good/scale) but it would solve the issue of ""it's mine"" I'm just wondering like when you should just not care.

I'm talking about tracking thoughts on projects, ventures, notes about stuff, it partially bothers me that it's not controlled/held by me

It's time lost though, you could just use this existing thing and get it over with/record stuff do the actual thing... I don't know. Trello's UI is convenient",06Oct2019,3

Obviously most said 16 years old. I was just going to let it go but I continued. I called mcdonalds, clothing retail, Wendy's, taco bell, etc. I did find a job b4 but my grandma didn't want me to have it because she wants me close to home. I understand because I have asthma and have a few mental health issues. It took a lot out of me to even talk to people (anxiety).  But after, it felt great. I am so excited.",06Oct2019,36
8,"My dad bought the house in the mid 1970s, married my mom, and they lived there until about 2 years ago. That's the house that I lived in until I was old enough to move out. That house holds a lot of memories; some good, but many bad. As long as I can remember, the house was always in poor condition. It was at least 100 years old, and had not been well maintained buy any of its owners.

My parents put the house up for sale when they moved out. It took about a year, but someone finally decided to buy it. Apparently, one of their ancestors lived in the house before my dad bought it. They intend to refurbish the house and have it given some sort of historical designation.

I don't know how to feel about it all. I've had a few years to process everything, but I still feel like I'm losing something even though I haven't lived there in almost 10 years. I hope whoever it is that bought the house is able to refurbish it and that maybe one day I'll be able to go back and visit the house I grew up in. Maybe I'll have some closure.",06Oct2019,2
9,"When I was 22 I moved over a thousand miles away from home. (USA, so still in the same country). I hadnt gone to college. I hadnt saved any money. I didnt have a decent job. And I hadnt really ever moved out from my moms house until then. 

Now I'm 26, and it took me a while of couch surfing and being in not-so-great situations, but last year I finally signed a lease on my very own apartment. I paid all the bills by myself. I got two cats that I cared for. It's been amazing. Being independent and having my own space has been the best experience of my life. I love my apartment so much, even though my downstairs neighbor's cigarette smokes wafts up sometimes, and even though I'm in an worn out, forgotten about little town with no parks and too many ugly, empty buildings. This apartment has meant so much to me. 

But over the last few months I lost my job and took a lower paying one, and I had a falling out with a few friends after realizing that I felt isolated by them, and they werent healthy relationships. So, now I'm a 1,000 miles away from home, and struggling financially even more so than I was before as a single person. And I feel alone. 

I talked to my mom about moving home, but its not an easy decision. My mom was abusive in the past, and we talked about that too. And how different things are now. It was incredibly validating, but the pain is still there. And my home town is a relatively small town compared to the big city I've been living in. It's in the south, and most of the people there suck. (But I've found people suck pretty much everywhere, you just have to find the ones who don't.) And I dont want to give up my independence and solitude. If I move back home, I wont even have my own room. I'll be sleeping on my moms couch. And that makes me feel even more embarrassing, than if I at least had my own space in her home. 

I'm scared, and I'm sad to give up this home I built for myself. I keep trying to remember that's it only evidence of my ability to build a home, and that I can do again. Hopefully in an apartment that doesnt sometimes smell like cigarettes.",06Oct2019,1

And the best part, I can’t tell if I have a legitimate problem or I’m just being lazy. But whatever it is, it’s definitely something I need to face.

I spent too much on useless things, and I accidentally lost the $20 I had in my pocket. Why I put it in my pocket and not my wallet, I have no idea. But I’m so stupid. I needed that money.

I have a low C in math. In college math. I could do a lot better, but I just haven’t been. I haven’t been able to kick myself into motion and actually do the homework. Why the fuck am I in college if I can’t even do shit right?

I know all of this is irrational, but goddamn, I’m stupid. Why the fuck can’t I just function normally in society. Why am I like this. Why can’t I do things right.

16,"TL;DR: essentially, my life is a mess 


So long story short my friend was having issues with her car last night so we pulled into an apartment complex waiting to get towed. As I was talking to the tow truck driver some random piece of shit went into her car and stole my whole purse. I now have no money to pay rent.  

Grateful he just took it and ran rather than me being stabbed or shot for him to steal it (cop said he’s in the exact apartment complex for those things all the time..lovely) but I really am just lost 

For some reason I thought I could handle picking up and moving across the country alone at 20 years old (now 21). I moved here and was waiting til i was considered a “resident” so i could finish my 4 year degree with in state tuition. I’ve been here for over a year and still can’t afford to go back to school. It breaks my heart every fucking day. I had so many plans for myself and living paycheck to paycheck wasn’t it. 

I make good money at my serving job but not nearly enough to catch up with how many bills / school loans I have. 

The past year of my life has been one of the greatest yet worst years of my life. I love where I live, I love all the friends I’ve made here, but I’m really starting to give up on myself. 

Every time I get ahead and have my bills on time, some crazy fucking shit happens to me and I’m back to square one. I hate asking people for help. I hate borrowing money from people, (I owe my sister enough and can’t even fathom asking her for another cent). The fact that I have contemplated finding a sugar daddy disgusts me. I have really thrown my morals out the window even considering such a thing. The thought of letting someone sleep with me just so I can pay my bills and take care of my dog disgusts me. The fact that I have even reached the point of considering something like this makes me question who I am and how fuckin wrong I am doing life. 


I love my Mom to death (she’s disabled and hasn’t been able to help me financially since i was 15) so I’ve gotten used to being independent but it’s hard knowing I will literally be homeless if I don’t figure things out myself. 
Pretty much all of my friends I work with have parents who pay their tuition, car insurance, basic necessities etc. while they’re in school (has never been my life and I’m fine with that) well...atleast i used to be. I always loved being independent and took so much pride in it but with how much I’ve been struggling I’ve started to analyze my entire life and imagine how different it would be if I had any type of support system...or if I didn’t have to leave school because I couldn’t handle working 40 hours a week and doing well in my demanding major at the same time (molecular cell biology).

I just want to finish my degree. I just want to be able to pay my bills and be successful. 

I am the happiest carefree person and MONEY is the only thing that has the power to break me down. 

I see successful people everyday and am sick af the fact that what they consider pocket change would change my entire life.

So this what the story kicks in ,i was listening to music waiting for the bus to reach my destination only been in the bus for 5 mins and the bus driver stop to pick up this two teenager kids who maybe go to different high school then me and the first one went to the bus paid his 1.25 to get in and the other one did the same but after he paid he told the bus diver a word no black person want to hear.He said was up N word,The bus driver didn't take that lightly and told both of the teenagers to get off the bus Immanently.I took off my earphones to listen in and both teenagers were really piss of getting kick out of the bus ,assuming there only way to get to school.

The bus driver then close the bus door and was about to leave that bus stop until one of the teenager who said the N word find a medium size rock and throws it at one of  windows were one of the public people would sit at.Then he automatically stop the bus to catch the two teenager but both left running before the bus driver realize what they had done.

He later call the cops and told everyone in the bus to either wait for the next bus that was gonna come in a another 30 mins or walk from there.I had no choice to wait for the next bus to come that wish make me late for my first period class.I told myself that was a bad way to start off my day.",06Oct2019,2

Women would rather fuck a physical specimen rather than fuck you. Nothing can change that. 

Getting married doesn't change that. She only settled with you. She'd still rather fuck a hot guy.

Sexual attractiveness is the most important. Emotional attraction, connection, blah blah is also tentative and fleeting. Sexual attraction is constant. It's always important.

39,"So this chick started working at my job a while back, and I was immediately attracted to her. I mean, physically she's like the epitome of what I look for in a woman. Beautiful eyes, dark hair, fair skin, just drop dead gorgeous. And as it turns out we have really good chemistry, which MANY people we work with have pointed out. But every time I try to ask her out, she either declines or accepts and makes up an excuse at the last minute. 

Now before you go assuming that I'm some narcissistic asshole who thinks someone is into me when they aren't, this girl shows a lot of interest. She drops what shes doing to come talk to me, she joins me while I'm smoking outside even though she doesn't smoke, she tickles me till I'm literally on the floor, and she walks with me to my car on the off chance that I'm leaving before her. I mean shit, maybe I'm wrong, but if I am then I'm not the only one because everyone else sees it happening too.

So why, oh why, does she keep turning me down? Sure she's shy, but if she's not so shy that she's tickling me into submission in front of our coworkers, why would hanging out together be a big deal? Why is it that actually spending time with me seems to be taboo with her?

I can only think of three reasons:

1) maybe she really is just that shy. I mean, she's just as much of a nerd as I am, so maybe it is just that simple

2) maybe I AM that asshole that assumes someone is into them when they aren't, OR 

3) ... Maybe it's the fact that her best friend and I kinda had a thing going before I met her. It didn't end badly per say, but it didn't end great. I wanted a committed relationship, she didn't, and I didn't wanna just be fuck buddies so I stopped anything intimate between us. Except I suspect she may still have feelings towards me in some way, which could very well be the main reason that my current crush keeps her distance regardless of showing interest

Or I could just be a self absorbed prick. Dunno. Idk what to do in this situation. I mean, if I'm right about the way I think my crush feels, then the only way it works between us is hurting someone else that we both care about (which won't happen for a multitude of reasons). If I'm wrong, then it's just another failed attempt to find love and I'm left in the dust. 

Either way, I can't see myself coming out of this scenario feeling like anything other than a loser. And that really fucking sucks.",06Oct2019,2

I have a girlfriend who feels very lonely and finds it hard to make friends, unfortunately due to distance we are unable to see each other very often and so she is on her own a lot. What advice may I give her in order to support her?

She has tried talking to people but from what it seems nobody pays proper attention to her and/or dislikes her for no apparent reason; I do however take this with a pinch of salt as I am unable to be there with her and so do not know how she interacts with other people. I have told her to push herself out there and to not worry about what others think about her but she says she has tried that and has been told by many people to do that yet it doesn't work. I feel incredibly bad for her because many bad things have happened to her throughout her life which have made me cry and this whole thing is just unfair, she has trust issues due to people that she thought she was friends with betraying her.

47,"I'll try and keep it short and simple but this does happen over the period of 8 years. Never mind it's long so TL;DR at the bottom.

It started in high school when I was 15 almost 16, even though she was a tom boy and I was more girly we we're both geeky so we shared a lot of interests and got along super well and clicked instantly. One particular memory that stands out to me around this time is when we were hanging out just the 2 of us and a teacher, known for being a bit eccentric, saw us and said ""I'm so glad you two found each other."" We shrugged it off as her just being her weird self but looking back it feels like she must have known something. 

Skip forward about 6 months, we're best friends, as close as you can be. One day were talking and she asked me if I'd ever date a girl.. I said I didn't know and that I'd never given it much thought, which was the truth, but little did she know that question would be stuck in my head and make me realise that:
1) Yes, I would absolutely date a girl 
2) I'm bisexual
3) I had the biggest crush on my friend. 

A few weeks went by and we started ""dating"" I've used quotation marks because we never really did anything, like we never even kissed. It lasted for about a month and she broke up with me for what seemed like no reason. Obviously there was a bit of tension afterwards as I didn't understand why she would just break up with me like that. I got over it pretty fast though and we went back to being friends. It stayed like that for a long time, I was crushing on her the whole time but I had to kind of push it to the side and try to forget about it. 

Fast forward again to the last 5 or 6 months of high school I finally get into a relationship with a man this time and the crush seems to fade a little but it's not gone just pushed even further back into the depths of my subconscious. I'm in this relationship for 4 years, in love, happy, got engaged, during this time I lost contact with all my high school friends, left the country I was living in and went with him back to my home country for a year, we came back to the country I'm currently in and that's when everything came apart, I found out that he was lying about almost everything he had ever told me about his past and he was pretending to be someone he thought was the ""perfect man"" for me ( in a dishonest and unforgivable way not I'm trying to be a better man for you way). So I left him.

The aftermath of the breakup was horrible I had to come to terms with the fact that the last 4 years of my life we're a lie and that I had wasted so much time and effort on nothing really. Needless to say I was really depressed and lonely but I managed to reach out to my old high school friends includeing mt crush and luckily they took me back. For a while I analysed everything in my head to try and see clues I missed of him showing his true self and tried to learn from the countless mistakes I made... Then it hit me, this man moulded his personality into someone he thought was what I wanted, so all the qualities that I thought I saw in him is what I'm attracted to right? This man was literally the male version of my friend, I couldn't believe I hadn't noticed until then, he made himself into my friend because that's what he saw I wanted. 

I should also mention during all of that time I realised I am also demisexual (which is probably why I didn't realise I was bi until I forced myself to think about it) and before I lost contact my friend told me she discovered that she was asexual, this explained why we didn't kiss and also why she broke up with me. I do wish she would have told me she was feeling that way instead of breaking up but I do understand how confusing it must have been for her.

So I move forward with my life, try and rebuild everything and strengthen the relationships I had almost ruined but everything is not okay, 6 months after my breakup and I'm finally feeling okay, not great but okay, all the feeling I suppressed for my friend have all come flooding back at once. I didn't know at the time that I was still hurting and still very vulnerable but I asked her out on a date, I told her it was a casual date and didn't have to mean anything, that it was basically a selfish request because I knew she didn't feel the same way I do and I also mentioned the we were very young when we dated and had never gone on a ""grown up"" date. To my utter shock she agreed and then that was that for some reason or another we could never find the time to do it, there was always something else and since I didn't want to be pushy and she thought it wasn't important (because I literally told her that so I wouldn't freak her out) it just got left, that was 7 months ago so it's safe to say it's too late.... 

Now the latest thing that happened she came out as trans (to me only, the rest of our friends don't know yet) and is now a he, this didn't matter to me because as I've said I'm bi so I still have the same feelings it's just for a guy now I guess. Also while he was telling me he also gave me the most  I'm seeing him this weekend for the first time since he came out and I'm curious to see how our relationship evolves. 

I cant help but think that maybe we have a chance, maybe what was holding us back was that he wasn't comfortable with his gender... I know I'm giving myself false hope but I can't help it.. I so desperately want to be with him even though I know that we want different things in a relationship and in life in general.

TL;DR: Had this crush for 8 years, consider this friend as a soul mate but there's always a reason that we wouldn't work out as a couple, something big has just happened and my stupid brain keeps hoping I have a chance",06Oct2019,2

49,"I just woke up and felt a need to type this, sorry if it makes no sense. 

It hit me like a brick recently that there's damn near nothing for me to do on the internet anymore.

I realized I just goddamn hate social media. Snapchat is full of ads and is basically a shitty tabloid. Instagram is just people posting the same things constantly trying to outdo each other or seem morally righteous and holier than thou. Memes are just the same joke over and over, and meme pages are just disgustingly greedy and self promoting past a certain level of popularity. 

The final straw for me is one of my former friends. She wastes days at a time in her room doing absolutely nothing except be online. She's been in various online relationships based around weird fandom things but never done anything with a real human being.

 Her private Instagram is full of depression, unhealthy obsession over certain men, misguided opinions, and -most of all- hentai. Her public is a halfway popular ""e-girl"" account that has creeps drooling over her for being ""le gamer girl,"" but it's completely an act, a complete lie. Her online persona and position of power over these people online completely masks her lonely and lazy existence. And yet she acts like (and had even said IRL) since she can control some men over the internet she has no reason to improve in real life. 

She used to be one of my best friends, and honestly I almost thank her for bringing me to see what a waste of time being in social media is. 

 Now, video games suddenly feel boring, and the few YouTubers I think are good post maybe once every two or three months. 

I'm still here though, because social media is still a habit, an addiction for me. A smoker can hate smoking and still smoke, but both I and the smoker need to quit. It's harder than I thought, I admit, but now I see that I have to do it. It's a complete waste of time, and I don't want to end up like her.",06Oct2019,784

I don't even have fond memories of anything anymore. I opened up an old box of toys recently just out of curiosity and honestly my first thought was that they're useless pieces of plastic and I should get rid of them. Not even a slight hint of nostalgia. 

Replying to texts feels more like a nuisance than anything. I want every conversation to end faster. Honestly when I get a notification I'm thinking to myself ""who is it and wtf do they want""

The idea of love is sort of disappearing too. Most of the time my friends/family feel like random people to me. And NSFW but I barely even register lust or sexual attraction anymore. It just feels weird now

I never learnt it. Since childhood, it was a pretty big deal to talk to girls. I used to fap daily since i was about 14-15.  I am a recovering porn addict too. The thing is that i have always seen women in sexual ways.

In school, i used to get bullied a lot. So i had a lots of self-esteem issues. It took me 5 years(2014-1019) to again become normal to believe in myself. I used to think i can never get a girl. I am still struggling with that stuff but i am 90% done.

Every girl that came to talk to me or i went to talk with, my end goal would be to have sex with her. I think this has a lot to do with my porn addiction. I have cut it cold turkey and havn't gone back for 10 days now. I am still making progress and i will never ever watch it again. 

I have had girlfriends before(when i was in high school) and i fucked it up because of my insecurity and pervertness. I was always afraid that they would leave me and i am not good enough. And i was a huge pervert. I used to always ask them their pictures and always turn every conversation sexual. And they would end up dumping me. At first i used to be hateful towards them and all but now i have realized i am the problem.

The problem is every women i had been with or had any chance with before, i never tried to know them or enjoy the conversation or connect. All i had in mind was how do i get this girl to fuck me.

Now i know the basic better yourself and all those stuffs. Because that is not the problem. The problem is my personality. I don't know how to talk with them. what do you talk with women about? How to connect with her as  a friend? And how do i go about with someone i like?  I literally don't know anything.

64,"Note: I originally posted this to r/confession, but believe my post was removed. Please keep in mind that this post is of that nature (describes the horrible things I have done).

I am part of an research group at my university. I go to a university in Asia, so the system here is a little different to that of western universities. But basically, this research group is one where you work under one professor from sophomore year until graduation, and you do intensive work on your research topic (we meet up every day of the week). 

I have been a horrible person in this research group. Always late, and I’ve even missed a lot of meetings due to oversleeping. Every time, I’ve apologized. But once, I flaked on a meeting with a client. I wasn’t the only one so my peers were there to cover, but a no-show on such a meeting is obviously unacceptable. I spent days in denial, ignoring the missed calls, not so much as sending a message to apologize. I thought that was it. I couldn’t face the confrontation. But I finally came to my senses. And I spent a message of deep apology, asking them to please let me work with them again. I knew this was my last chance. I couldn’t screw up anymore.

But guess what? I did. I flaked on one meeting because I was unprepared, was too scared to face the consequences, and cut off contact again. This ended up piling on a lot of my work load to my peers. Up until the day of the event we were preparing for, I was out of contact and no-show. I just couldn’t face them anymore. I knew I had fucked up for good. Apologizing at this point seemed so useless, because I’ve done the same stuff before, apologized, but here I was again. So I didn’t. Right after that event summer break rolled around, so there weren’t anymore meetings for 2 months. And when school resumed, I just went to the research group. Obviously I was super anxious. I was ready to face the worst. But everyone treated me normally, and acted like nothing had happened. Almost too nice, I couldn’t believe it. However, at certain points, I feel a certain air of coldness towards me. I know that underneath it all, things aren’t alright. I can’t just flake on something important like that and act like I never did.

If I want to alleviate my guilt, and not have to face the people I have wronged, I know that I can just quit. It will affect my future career path, but I deserve it. However, I don’t know if this is the best course of action for the research group itself. First, as horrible and unreliable of a person I am, I do make contributions when I work. If I leave, there will be more weight on my peers to work. We have projects in small groups as well, and even having one person gone increases the work load on the others a lot. Secondly, it will leave a bad aftertaste. I haven’t heard of anyone that’s left the research group abruptly, after over a year of being in it. It’s a super big deal, and one that wouldn’t be taken lightly. I would even have to personally ask the professor to remove me, something that might make him consider this to be a ‘troublesome’ year. I don’t want my peers graduating from a research group that has a past, a lingering bad aftertaste that they can’t quite ignore.

Maybe these are just excuses I am giving myself because at the end of the day, I want to stay. Please do let me know if it is in the best interests of the research group that I leave. I have 3 options now: leave, apologize and stay, or don’t mention it and stay.

I should mention that over the summer break, I have seriously worked on self-improvement and have been able to tackle my lateness, oversleeping, and flaking habits. Maybe I will regress, I can’t make any promises, but for now, these will no longer be an issue going forward. (If I do regress, I seriously will quit at that point.) The issue is how horrible I have been and how I haven’t owned up to it in anyway, and how my peers’ reliability and opinion on me are forever crushed no matter what I do at this point.",06Oct2019,1

I sat in the park for a while after getting my supplies from the grocery store. I wasn’t expecting that the place would be full of children since the weather was cloudy and it feels that the rain will start to pour anytime. The previous weeks were too heavy for me. It was one of those days or weeks when I'm having doubts about my decisions, partnered with fear that I wouldn’t accomplish anything in life. I was spiraling and felt suffocated with all of the existential dread. That’s why I decided to spend a little time in the park, to breathe. I watched the children play as I sip my coffee and nibble my biscuits. It was good not to be alone with my thoughts. There was a mother who was teaching her son how to ride a bicycle, a father who gently pushed the swing for her daughter. Two little girls were taking turns to slide, and boys who played soccer. I gazed back to the little girls on the slide, and noticed that the older girl was holding her baby sister, their mother was at the side of the slide and put the baby on the lap of the eldest girl,  she was at the upper edge of the slide, embracing her baby sister tightly. The baby was sitting quietly without any idea that this would be her first time to go down on a slide. The big sister pushed her body away from the edge, and they slid away. The mother was laughing as she picked her daughters on the ground. The girls were safe, whilst the baby was a bit shocked. The elder sister was laughing now together with her mother. I found herself smiling, but not too long, for the memories of the past came rushing in. I remembered my childhood, the times when I visited the park near our house together with my father. How I tried to ride the seesaw while my father was on the other end, controlling his weight so I could be lifted. I missed my home; I missed my family. The rain was not pouring yet, but my fear about the future started to. What ifs and will I evers messed with my head. Will I ever have my own child? I asked myself.  What if I can’t be a responsible mother? Can I raise a family, in this kind of economy, with this kind of enviroment? Will I ever get married? What if I remain single? I stopped thinking; the steady drizzle of rain washed away the clutters I made up on my mind. I gathered my things, opened my umbrella and started walking away.",06Oct2019,1

72,"So I just posted here yesterday, about how I had to break it off with my girlfriend because I was mentally exhausted. She called me an ass. I had to block her because I was sure she was going to keep on insulting me and blaming me. 

She used her back up account to send me this:

“Hey, thanks for 
chickening out instead of just dumping me like a normal person, totally appreciate it. And don’t worry about blocking this account too, I’ll do it for you. I don’t want to talk to you, you with your ‘communication is everything; unless I don’t want to hear it,’ bullshit. You with your ‘I can give you empty promises, but I’ll throw a fit if you make the same mistake twice,’ bullshit. I don’t know if you meant that we were done, but I definitely do. And I’ll tell you that, because I’m not a pussy. Thanks for letting me know you’re a prick, wish you did it a year sooner, before I poured my heart into you. Good riddance.”

Let me break this down. I didn’t chicken out. I was being insulted, and blamed for not trying hard enough when I was putting you over me at all times. My physical and mental health were constantly strained because I was trying to figure out what I was doing wrong all the time and how I could fix it. 

“Communication is everything until I don’t want to hear it”? Same goes for you. When did you ever actually try to talk to me? When I would actually be there for you and listen to you did you try to communicate? I didn’t want to hear it because it was one sided and you wouldn’t see that you were causing a lot of damage. 

“I can give you empty promises, but will throw a fit if you make the same mistake twice.” No. No no no. Those promises weren’t empty. They were just too much to live up to for your expectations. I “threw a fit” because you put me down for trying to be better for you. Of course I’m gonna be upset at that. How dare you blame this all on me. Yes, I admit. There were things I myself could have done better. I was trying to do better. I was always trying my hardest. But it was never enough. 

“I don’t know if you meant we’re done, but I definitely do. I’ll tell you that because I’m not a pussy.” Wow. Wow. I don’t even know what to tell you here. I did mean we’re done. The way I told you, wasn’t me being a “pussy” it was me putting my foot down and stopping communication because you were affecting my mental health. 

“Thanks for letting me know you’re a prick.” Thanks for letting me know you‘re one as well. 

“Wish you did it a year sooner, before I poured my heart into you. Good riddance.”

73,"I know that this is probably pretty trivial, but I need to talk about it. 

So, about 2 years ago, at the tail end of my sophomore year, I moved from where I had lived for the past 10 years (Northern Cali) to Portland Oregon. My best friend and I started to drift apart. For the first 2 months, I didn't even have a group of friends to hang out with. Then summer came, and it was awful. We moved to Portland for my mom's job, which promised 6 figured if we moved. Well, that didn't happen, so for most of summer, I had no wifi. Thank God for Starbucks, the library, and Minecraft, or I would have never made it. But this meant that I had very little contact with my friends. Both the ones in Cali and in Portland. Then, finally, summer ended. In my junior year, I hang out with the same friend group. It took 6 months for me to feel comfortable around this group. Then, in May, my mom broke the news: we would have to move again in the next month, or we'd be homeless. 

I did as much as I could with my friends in the last month. We had a good time. But, eventually, the day came. I had to say goodbye to my friends. We promised to keep in touch, just like my best friend did in Cali, then, we left this time to Dayton OH.

I've now been here for 4 months, and I thought I was doing well. I made friends that I was comfortable with in about 3 weeks. Sure, I drifted from my old friends, but I expected that. However, I just realized now how much these moves have affected me.

75,"I live by doing the bare minimum of what is required of me. Don't get me wrong, things could be worse. I'm still getting by in life, but only doing what's just enough to do so. I just feel like *almost* nothing matters in life. For example, I'll study for my exams, do my homework and attend class because those are all requirements, but I won't do anything optional that requires effort, unless it involves my passions (which are making music and studying psychology). 

I used to workout 6 days a week but I don't anymore because I think what's the point? I don't go the extra mile or take any extra steps because I think what's the point? I feel like I'm nobody special, I'm just another guy. People say I'm perfect just the way I am and do make me feel like I'm loved, but I can't help but feel guilty and have difficulty loving myself. I guess you could say the point in taking extra steps or going that extra mile is to provide myself some benefit and make me less lazy, but I can't seem to find the motivation to do it and I blame my depression and social anxiety.

Depression makes it hard to stay motivated and even if I do motivate myself, my social anxiety makes it difficult for me to put myself out there. I'm a homebody who spends his time on his laptop, no-lifing on the internet and just listening to music. As much as I wish I could, I rarely hang out with anybody, go out to parties, go to the gym anymore, and sometimes I just feel like I'm rotting in my room. I take drugs (mainly adderall) to counter this feeling in order to make me more motivated and social, but even then I still stay inside and just ride out the high.

I know it's just a matter of me picking myself up and putting myself out there, but easier said than done I guess. Maybe one day things will change on their own, but it's most likely up to me.

76,"Excuse the ""sensational"" title.

A month ago, I was sick at home. Having nothing to do, I downloaded a dating app and started to chat. If any of you used dating apps, you know how hard it is to find someone.. real. 

I found her by accident, and we clicked. I made some shitty jokes and she laughed and continued the jokes. I wanted to meet her for a coffee later that week, but.... she was just visiting and was to leave later on that night.

I was disappointed, but kept chatting to her. She got to the airport, and I wished her bon voyage. She was gone. Except.. she mixed the dates of the flight; her flight was the day after.

I jumped to the occasion and asked her to meet in the morning. She agreed. So the next morning, half sick, I met her for an hour. That is all we had. We walked a bit and showed her some nice sites. I took her back to her hotel, and after kissing her on the cheeks, I decided to kiss her. She kissed me back. I was delighted. We promised to keep in contact. She left that night.

Strangely enough, we did. Every day. We shared a few calls, and once jokingly, I asked if I could go visit her. She said she could host me if I wanted to. Delighted, I confirmed my off days, and she confirmed hers. Flights were a bit expensive, but money is worthless compared to memories. 

So last Thursday I went. 3.5 hour flight to Northern Europe. She met me at the airport, her beautiful blue eyes smiling at me. She took a 2 hour bus just to meet me , so we could drive together back to her home. While she drove, I loved listening to her telling me the small details about the places we were driving by. 

She isn't rich in any way, but from the little she has, she shared everything with me. She wouldn't even let me wash a plate, she was the ultimate host. I gave her a small present , earrings. She is not the kind of person to show enormous excitement, but I could see she was very grateful. She wore them the whole 3 days I was there.

The days went by, we visited cities, we lazed around. It was beautiful to be in her company. We had sex, but the most amazing feeling was her sleeping cuddled to me at night, or taking my hand while walking, or holding my hand while she was driving. Such small, beautiful gestures.

This morning we woke up early; she took me to the airport. While she was driving, I got a bit emotional but kept the tears back. We spoke about ""this thing"", and we both agreed that this happened from nothing and that it is a real pity about the distance.  When we got to the departure point at the airport, there was a line on the floor that said: ""No kissing beyond this point"". She saw it , smiled and looked in my eyes. We kissed, I hugged her and we kissed again. We said our goodbyes.

The moment I crossed that line, I felt physical pain.  I started missing her almost immediately. I landed back home, and while showering , I could not bear it any longer and started crying. A 32 year old grown man, crying over a lady I wasn't even supposed to meet. I am still crying while writing this. I am so glad I was lucky enough to meet her, but so sad that we cannot be together. 

Thank you for making these 3 days magical, you beautiful Lithuanian girl. You will someday make some man a very, very lucky husband.",06Oct2019,528
77,"I’m not sure what I hope to accomplish by posting this but I guess I just want to talk it. I have noticed this with three of my close friends now (I am including my mom as one of the people). They say that they feel lonely, life is not great, they don’t connect with anyone. 

To be quite honest, the fact that feel this way makes me a little angry because it’s like, are we not even friends? Especially with my mom, like we talk every single day, do you not consider that connecting? I feel like I am not enough for them and that makes me angry. 

On the other hand, these people have struggled with depression/anxiety and I know that it isn’t my fault, and nothing I do can remedy their loneliness. But still I am frustrated because I don’t understand how they can feel like that. With my mom again, she told me the other day that she doesn’t have much to look forward to? And that she doesn’t have much in life. How the hell could she say that? She has an entire ass family who loves her. Perfectly physically capable and financially well. I don’t fucking understand. 

Then, I just checked Facebook and saw that my friend posted “I don’t connect with anyone, I’m boring, I don’t have anything to say to my friends, etc.” Did we not just hang out last weekend and you made me laugh like the entire time? Did we not have fun together??? I am so frustrated but at the same time I feel bad for feeling angry because being angry won’t help them lol. 

My other friend I think has been getting better but she told me that she’s struggling with feeling lonely here in our hometown, which I can kind of understand because most of her extended family is overseas but like, am I not here for you? I don’t know man. 

I guess this is a combination of not feeling appreciated and also just not being able to understand them. I don’t know what to do. And I don’t think feeling angry about it will get me anywhere.",06Oct2019,2
78,"So on Friday night my phone was stolen out of my pocket whilst I was ordering a drink at a bar. Luckily it was locked securely and I put a message  on it to say ""if found please call ..."".

Someone called on Saturday! He said he found it on the floor outside a train station I was no where near. But who cares I got it back - yay!

Today, I cycled to meet my friend for a coffee. A wholesome Sunday afternoon. Came back to find my bike had been stolen. The helmet and lock was just left on the ground.

It wasnt even an expensive/good bike.

Ah well",06Oct2019,32
79,"I was approached by this incredibly beautiful, witty, smart woman who's in the same college class as I am. Struck up a conversation with her, found out we had a lot in common, met her a few more times after classes over the next few days, we got on really well, she gave me her number and she started texting me. 


The following week I asked her out to dinner, and she said she was really busy. Radio silence since then. Sometime between the time I met her and now, I was fantasizing like an idiot about having her as my girlfriend. And now I'm pretty certain she doesn't feel the same way.


Why do I bother. Why even meet people. I'm not even sad, I'm annoyed at myself for actually thinking I'll find someone this time. I'm such a moron.",06Oct2019,0
80,"And no one knows. 

I keep a small group of friends and don’t post on social media much because I don’t really care about all that stuff. Sometimes I crave that feeling of being wanted, but I don’t know if I should because it feels toxic to me and I get conflicting thoughts in my head. I think I have a pretty strong willpower but at times like these it’s hard to keep a smile on my face. 

I’m 21 now, is this normal to feel??",06Oct2019,12
82,"Minimalism is such an interesting thing, being able to improve our quality of life quite a bit. On this video I talk a little about my path as a non-extreme minimalist. 

The whole idea is that we can live with less. Less material things, less distractions. This way we can focus on things that truly matter to us, rather than something imposed by others.

But even though I relate to minimalism, I can safely say that I'm not on an extreme side of the spectrum. I do like the concept, but still apply it on my life for the things that I consider appropriate. My goal is not to say to others that I'm a minimalist (I actually don't care at all if others might think I'm not a minimalist). I enjoy the idea, and I apply it to my life aiming to improve it.

83,"I have Meniere's Disease in both ears recently diagnosed. had it for 2 years. Recently I found a scientific article saying that the hair cells of the vestibular system in the ear detect CO2 and cause the autonomic breathing reflex. The scientist who wrote the article argued it was the cause of 'Sudden Infant Death Syndrome'. The same people who wrote this paper, did a study on mice, by injecting something in their ears which killed off vestibular hair cells. The mice all stopped breathing and died.

Meniere's Disease kills off these vestibular hair cells that are (according to the paper) important to survival (autonomic breathing reflex/chemosensation) so eventually according to that article, I will stop breathing in my sleep or forget to breathe (Ondine's Curse) and not even know i need to breathe and then pass out and die.

87,"So this is going to be a long story, thanks in advance for reading. Any advice would be appreciated.

Trigger warning; drug use, rape. 

About six months ago I met this girl on tindr. We hit it off immediately, I mean it was love at first sight. Our first date was simple, we saw Pet Semetary and went and got Steak and Shake. We continued to see each other about once a week for a good while before we made things official. We usually met on a Tuesday because that was the way our schedules worked out. One weekend we went to Disney Springs to see a friend of mine and I ended up spending a lot of money so I couldn't see her on our usual Tuesday. I heard from her sporadically for a few days when we usually talked a lot. She agreed to meet me on the following Tuesday. She was supposed to stay at my house for like a week because my parents were going to be out of town. When I finally met her she told me what happened to her. She had gone over to this persons house to help them move, she had given a man a ride and he had forced her to go down on him. Eventually she got back to the house and her friend was doing meth and she asked for some, because of what happened to her. Some how after that, she ended up stripped of her clothes, locked in a closet and pimped out against her will, injected with meth repeatedly against her will, denied water only to be offered water that was mostly meth. This went on for several days. I told her to press charges but she refused for a variety of reasons, one being that shes trans and that the cops literally would not care. Which is pretty true because the world is shit.

When she finally calmed down, she asked if she could come live with me because she lived with her sister/mother and she was in active addiction and my girlfriend was trying to get clean. I agreed, I was pretty sure I could convince my parents, and if not we had a week to get her a new job by me and figure something out. She followed me in her car. On the way there she was driving erratically. When we got to my house, her behavior got worse. She began to break things and scream at me. She screamed at me that she was going to rape me, she threatened to hit me, she called me a stupid whore. She said that only some as ugly and unloveable as me would love a broken tr\*nny like her. She broke the door to my parents room by kicking it, she threw a bedside table into a wall, breaking the table and damaging the wall, she broke a glass bottle of syrup on the floor. I stepped on glass and cut my foot pretty bad. She stripped naked and took a knife and threatened to cut her genitals off and cut herself. She ended up getting dressed again only to run into the street and strip again, screaming about things. I convinced her to come back into the house after about fifteen minutes of this, during which time she pissed on my car.

I legit did not know what to do. Looking back I know I should have called the police and gotten her help, a psych hold or something. I now know that it was probably a combination of what had been done to her and meth psychosis.

I ended up following her from room to room, trying to calm her down. Eventually she collapsed on my bed and began to beg me to either let her cut herself or to go buy her a hit of crack. I should mention at this time that (I thought) she was a recovering addict. She told me that she was been clean of herion and crack for like three months. The screaming and begging went on for more then an hour. Eventually I caved and agreed to drive her to Sarasota to buy crack. Agreeing to this seemed to calm her down some so I thought she would be okay while I went to get my keys. During the like few minutes I spent looking, she stabbed one of her tires with a knife and took a tire iron to her radio screen.

I managed to get her into the car and we got on the road. She spent most of the drive throwing things out the window until I managed to convince her to stop. Mostly her stuff, mainly make up, a hair brush, some hair spray. Not long after we got off the interstate, she came around a little bit and asked me why we were in my car. Stupidly, I told her what she had done to her car. She freaked out and told me that she couldn't have done that to her car, that she had an interview in Tampa that morning for a job at a radio station. I'm positive this was a delusion.

She started freaking out again and swallowed most of a bottle of Valium, it was a new bottle, we had gotten it filled that day. I was unaware of exactly how much she had taken, she told me it was only a few over her daily dose of three. I thought she was fine until she became unresponsive. I drove to the nearest gas station, there were two empoyees smoking outside, and screamed that my girlfriend was overdosing, what was the address? They told me and one of the employees, God bless her, helped me get my fiance out of the car and onto the ground. It was thankfully only few minutes until the police and ambulance got there. While the paramedics were working on her she threw up some of the Valium. I'm convinced this saved her life.

I managed to calm down enough to call her mother/grandmother, who didn't answer, and her sister/mother, who did. Then I followed the ambulance. It took me a while to get there because I was still freaking out and couldn't follow the gps right. In hindsight, I was too worked up to drive. It's a miracle I didn't wreck.

Her sister/mother was there at the hospital when I got there. I don't know how long we were there before they finally told us that she was stable but she couldn't have any visitors that night. I went home.

I drove myself home, called my parents and told them what had happened, crying the entire time naturally, and tried to clean up the house before I passed out. I slept for most of the day. At some point, my girlfriend's mom called me and told me that my girlfriend had woken up, freaked out and tried to run from the hospital room, kicked everyone out of the room screaming that I was the only one she wanted. Appearently she was so violent that they put her in soft restraints and put her in a medical coma. After I finished talking to her I cried until I passed out again. It was about 8 at night before I woke up again. The first thing I did was call the hospital and check on her. They told me she was resting comfortably. I finished cleaning the house and went back to bed.

I went to the hospital the first thing in the morning. She was still out of it. I was there for a few hours before she came around at all. We talked for a while, I told her I loved her. I wrote my number on the white board in the room and told her to ask the nurses to call me if she really needed me. Before I left, I offered to go get her a soda from the vending machine. She loves soda. The only reason I mention getting a soda is because I didn't have enough money. There were two very nice older ladies who came up with $1.75 for a Coke. God bless them, they were angels from Heaven.

I went home and slept for a little while, woke up and called the hospital and was told that she was fine and resting comfortably, that she was asleep. When I went back to the hospital in the morning, I found her in hard restraints and soaked in urine. Apparently, during the night she had become distraught and asked her nurse to call me. The nurse said she did and that I ""didn't want to talk to you."" This made her freak out so bad that they put her in hard restraints. They left one hand free and gave her a urinal so she could relieve herself. Because she was still pretty out of it, she dropped the urinal while trying to use it. The nurse refused to give it back to her, causing her to piss herself. She laid in piss until I got there and cleaned her up. If I ever see this nurse in person I will punch her in the throat. There is no reason for a medical proffessional to treat a patient like that. There was no reason for her to tell my girlfriend such a blatant lie just to hurt her, some one who was already mentally fragile.

I stayed with her all day, waiting for the doctor. Her mother/grandmother was there for about two hours but left long before the doctor got there. The doctor was another piece of work. He insinuated that it was her fault for the assault, that it wouldn't have happened if she wasn't trans and told me not to comfort her when she cried. Seriously, if I ever meet him in a dark alley with no cameras I will stab him. In the end he sent us on our way with out so much as a suggestion as to how to help her. If she had gotten some kind of help then, things would have been different.

&amp;#x200B;

We went back to my house for a few days. That night, she asked me to marry her. I said yes. I love her with all my heart. My parents didn't want her in the house anymore. I wanted to be with her. Her mom got us a cheap hotel room. Things were alright for about a day. I went to work that night, got back and slept for a while.

I'm not sure what day it was but I know we hadn't been in the hotel room very long before she offered me what she claimed was pot resin. At this point I wasn't very expierenced with drugs. I had smoked pot a few times, I could count them on both hands and still have fingers left over. I agreed and took the hit. I don't know why. I liked it, it made me feel good, very different then the times I had tried pot before. For about a week, we did this 'pot resin' every day, a few times a day. Eventually she told me the truth. She had been giving me crack. Of course, by then I didn't really care what it was, I just wanted more. One morning, after getting me very high the night before, on both pot and crack, so high I could barely move, she left me to sleep. I'm not sure how long I was asleep but when she called me that she was on her way back from Sarasota and I checked my bank account, I realised that she had spent all of my $500 on drugs to sale. That was her plan for a new job, to sale drugs. Because she could get good drugs in Sarasota and sell them for more in the area we were in. Stupidly, I let this go. We never saw a return on our investment, by the way.

We were in the hotel for about a month, thanks to a combination of her mother and my parents, both of whom we lied to about how much the hotel cost and how we were spending our money. We were doing crack all day, everyday. Driving back and forth from Sarasota, a round trip of nearly two hours. I begged and lied to everyone I knew to get money.  We pawned my Xbox, she swore we would get it back. We never did. She even brought me crack to do while I was on my break at work. Eventually, the hotel was no longer an option. But, her mom had a solution. She had a horse trailer on her boyfriends property that we could stay in. It was a nice horse trailer, with air condition and an outlet and an air matress to sleep on. The only problem was that we were not allowed in the house to shower or use the toilet unless her mother/grandmother was home.

But it was free, which meant more money for crack. And for my girlfriend, her drug of choice, herion. She had shot up maybe twice while we were in the hotel. Once with Diladud and once with herion. The time with herion she offered to let me try a little of it to see if I liked it. I turned her down, something I thank God for. While we were at the hotel, we gave a ride to and hung out a little bit with some one she knew. This guy smoked herion instead of shooting it up. She convinced him to let me try it. Stupidly, I did. One little hit and then a bigger one about twenty minutes later. I didn't like the way it made me feel and it made me throw up.

We continued in the horsetrailer for maybe a month before my fiance got what she thought was a good offer. A drug dealer she knew would give us a room for $100 a month if she let them use her car and helped them sell drugs. That night, I went to work and she went to the house. Usually, even when I'm at work, we talked constantly. But she stopped texting me or answering my phone calls. I was afraid that something had happened to her, that she had been in a car accident or that she had overdosed. I told my supervisor that my fiance had been in a car accident and that she was in the hospital with serious injuries. I did 100 mph pretty much the entire way back to the house. When I got there, she was asleep. I cried and she woke up a little. She came too more a little while later. When she was fully awake, we went and bought crack.

When we got back to the house, the drug dealer gave us a molly blunt, something that had been agreed on earlier. We smoked it. Then my fiance gave me what she said was a molly rock to swallow. I did. For a while, it was alright, a little intense but alright. I remember vividly that I wanted to fool around but she refused, saying I was too high to consent. Something I told her one night at the hotel. Then what ever the rock was kicked in.

&amp;#x200B;

Things went really bad. I hallucinated. There was something in the closet that wanted to kill us, the black clothes on the bed were murdered children. My fiances face kept changing. During this time, we drank a bottle of water and a big soda, but it wasn't enough. My mouth was so dry I couldn't talk. She talked about going to go get a soda or a water from the convience store down the street. I begged her not to go. She told me to come with her. I literally could not get off the bed, just having the light on was too much, gettting in a moving vehicle would have been hell. I begged her to just go fill the soda cup in the bathroom. She refused, saying that the tap water would make me sick. Eventually, she agreed to stay with me. She turned the light off and I lose some time. At some point I know she was on the floor crying about something. Then I come around, I'm laying on the bed and she's touching me. I beg her to stop. She doesn't. I couldn't move to get away from her.

I must have passed out because the next thing I know its morning and there are people outside our room talking about the best ways to get rid of our dead bodies. I start crying. I must have been loud because the next thing I know, the drug dealer in bursting in the door and demanding that we leave. That was fine by me. I flew out of the house and to my car. I don't know how long or how far I drove. I just know that at some point I made it too a CVS and called my dad and told him everything. I was crying so hard I could barely talk. He kept telling me to go in the store and ask the address, but I literally couldn't get out of the car. Some how I managed to use the phones friend finder thing to share my location. I don't know how long it took them to get to me. I honestly don't remember. One minute I was crying on the phone, the next I was in the car, then I was in the bathroom at home.

At some point I went to bed. My dad took my phone. My fiance called many times before my dad finally answered and told her to never call me again, that they were thinking of taking me to the hospital and pressing charges. My fiance says that she begged them to do just that if it would mean I would be alright. She had my debit card and all my id's and everything. She pulled about $150 out of my account and spent it on drugs during that time. She says he tried to kill herself with crack during that time.

The next day she texts me and I tell her I never want to see her again, I tell her what she did to me. She begs me to change my mind. She sends me a picture of a slit wrist, she has a history of self harm and at least two suicide attempts. I tell her that is a foul thing to do, how dare she leave me with that after everything she had done to me. She comes back with pictures of her uncut wrists, apologising for sending me that picture.

After I've calmed down, I agree to meet her to get my stuff back. She had most of my clothes, my debit card, all of my credit cards, my id, my work id, pretty much everything of mine. My dad takes me. When I see her again, I break down crying because I love her and I don't want to lose her even after everything we had been through. We agree to give it two weeks. If she could stay clean and pass a drug test in two weeks, we would get back together.

That night was a slow night at work, which was a good thing because I was withdrawing bad. I hallucinated bugs crawling all over me, even out of my eyes.

She picked me up from work that morning and we spent the day together. Then she took me back to work. I threw up at the front desk so they sent me home. She tells me that I'm withdrawing and that the best thing to do would be to buy some crack and wean ourselves off of it. Too get a 20 and break it up into little peices and do little hits for the next 24 hours until it was gone. I agreed, this made sense. Also I wanted it. But the dealer we went to knew something was up. He was one of the ones we usually went to, not the same drug dealer whos house we stayed at. This guy had better shit. Anyway, instead of a 20, he gave her a 40. Or maybe she found another $20. I don't know.

At first, we stuck to the plan, little hits. But instead of making it last, we did it all pretty quickly. I told her that that day was the last time. The very last. This was something I had said and she had agreed to before. Some time later, after we had failed to go to sleep in the horse trailer, she told me that because we hadn't gone to sleep it was still the same day and that she could get more money so why didn't we go get more crack. Of course I agreed. But I told her that this would be the very last day. If I ever found out abot her buying drugs after that I would leave her. She agreed.

Eventually, my parents called me and begged me to come home so I did. The next morning, she called me and told me that one drug dealer, the one she usually got herion from had taken her car. Well, been given her car. To square a debt. This dealer was only supposed to have for about two hours but never bought it back. I don't believe that she hadn't been using so I tell her I'm done, I'm coming to get my shit and I never want to see her again. She had kept some of my clothes and some blankets that I liked. And my best pillow. I even gave her back the engagement ring she had given me. She begged me to stay, swore up and down that she hadn't been using. I told her that no, I wouldn't stay, that I was leaving right then.

Then I saw her arm. She had a really bad abcess from shooting up with a dirty needle. I knew her mom wouldn't take her to the hospital, so I would. I still loved her. On the way there, she managed to convince me that she hadn't been using. I believed her. Because I'm a fucking moron. And I loved her still. She had told me some really fucked up shit about her mom. Like her mom used to beat her up and told her if she told anyone she would shoot her and feed her to the gators. That one time her mom/grandmother and another time her mom/sister had made her stop taking her hormones so she could get hard and forced her to have sex with them. That her mom/grandmother had locked her in a dog crate for weeks and forced her to eat dog food and sent her brother in there to beat her up. And, after everything had happened between us her mother told her that if she went to rehab she wouldn't have a place to stay when she got out, but if she didn't go she could stay in the horse trailer.

After the hospital, she says she thinks she knows where the car is, so we go to get it. Its not there. But while we are there, she calls the drug dealer we had been staying with for Suboxen. She had a percription but had left the bottle there when we had left that night. She had been buying her pills back for $20 a piece. The dealer has an offer for us. A pill for $10 if we take some crack and tell her how it is. She mut have heard us say that her stuff wasn't very good. We go back and forth for a few minutes, but this time I'm strong and I tell her no. She agrees. We just buy the pill. She says that theres no way we can get clean if we stay in Florida, but she has a job offer in Virginia and a friend who offered us a place to stay if we came up here. She tells me hard drugs are harder to get up here. I want to be with her and I want to get clean. So I agree. The dealer she had leant her car to finally left it where she was supposed to, so my fiance gets her shit out of it and we leave it there. It was in her mom/grandmothers name.

I go to my house and get my things. I have a huge fight with my parents because they think I'm making the biggest mistake of my life, but that doesn't stop me. I pack the car and we leave. Some how a trip that was supposed to take maybe 12 hours took four days. We kept having to stop at hospitals. The packing they had put in her arm fell out and she had a panic attack. The hospital wouldn't give her any Valium even though she had a siezure in the waiting room. We drive for another day and go to a different hospital in a different state but they refuse to repect her pronouns and make it extremely clear that aren't going to do anything to help her, so we drive to Virginia. We had to call and beg money from my parents and her mom and my friends several times. But we make it Virginia and the house we were going to be staying in. I learn then that the room was not in fact offered but that my fiance had begged for it and the job she said she had didn't actually exist.

But she manages to find a job in about a week, a pizza delivery job. Meanwhile, I haven't had my anti depressents since we left my house for the hotel, so I fell into a deep depression. I'm unable to get out of the bed except for NA meetings, which we attend religiously. And church, which we start going to. We also go to church suppers on Wedsnday and the food pantry on Thursday.

The people we are staying with have 8 dogs. They are all really good dogs. One night, while out delivering pizzas, which was also her job, my land lady finds a cat. He's emaciated and covered in ether grease or oil.  This cat is in really bad shape. The entire time we have him, he pees maybe twice and only poops once so he had some kind of internal damage. She brings him home and we are charged with his care. My fiance cleans him up and we dub him Ricky Bobby. He's a good cat. At first hes a little shy but literally on the first night he was laying on the bed next to me purring as I pet him. Within a few days he's laying on me and but his head against my hand for pets. I really bond with this animal, for a little while I even get over my depression and start reading books instead of scrolling through tumblr. One night, we go to pick up my land ladies husband from work. While we are out we pick up a can of cat food. I take the cat food to Ricky Bobby. Something happened to the door, I don't know if I legitimately didn't close it all the way or if it was because it was broken but the door was opened and the dog, one dog in particular, a New Guinea Singing Dog, got into the room and attacked Ricky Bobby. I hear him yowling and I run to help him. We all tried to get this dog off him, we all get bit in the process. We fail to save Ricky Bobby. My fiance and the husband kick me out of the room so I don't know if the cat was mauled to death or if the dog broke his neck like I was told. I do know that the husband mopped the floor and they wouldn't let me back into the room until that was done. I was freaking out, I was having a mental break down. I couldn't stop screaming and I couldn't breathe. My land lady and my fiance both tell me that it was probably for the best, that at least it was quick, that Ricky Bobby either would have gotten sicker and sicker until he died in our room or if we took him to a shelter like we planned to he would have been put down. He was that sick.

She ends up getting fired from the pizza job for things that weren't her fault. I believe that she was telling the truth on this. She ends up getting another job at a hookah bar. Its supposed to be a good job except shes getting paid under the table. But the owner tells her all these great things, like how he's gonna make her manager and shes gonna make $5 plus tips, how if she doesn't make enough tips then he'll pay her minimum wage to make up the difference. She doesn't make alot in tips. One night she makes $150, the next she barely clears $20. Also the hours are grueling, the work is hard. At some point during the week or so she works there, she starts using again. I didn't find out until much later, but I had my suspicions, I just didn't want to believe. She ends up getting really sick from over work one night and quits the hookah bar.

While she was at the hookah bar, my depression got worse then ever. One night I planned to kill my self. I planned to drive my car to the James River Bridge and jump off. I call my mom and say good bye and get dressed. I try to call my fiance but she doesn't answer. I call the suicide hotline and they manage to talk me down, but it was a near thing. I was ready to go through with it. When I pick her up from work, she I tell her all this. We cry and go home and go to sleep. She stops letting me take her to and from work. 

She decided to drive for Uber. She can't drive under her account because we can't acces it and she has several arrests. on her record. So she drives under mine. We don't look anything alike, but it works for like a week. During that week, she sees some one get shot in the head. This understandably fucks her up. But she carries on. Until she tried to change the picture to one of hers, then Uber cancelled the account. We search the room and find the sim card from her old phone that got fucked. It got broken when it fell into the toilet when she was wahing ricky Bobby. The replacement phone got stolen. We get hernumber hooked up on my phone and she signs up for Uber. She talks to them and tell them about her back ground. They say that as long as her driving history comes back clean, she'll have the job. They get her history from Virginia and Florida back pretty quickly but it takes longer for North Carolina. We wait about a week before she finally starts looking for a different job. Eventually she hears from Uber that they aren't going to accept her because of her arrests but she welcome to try again in a few months. Around now is when I tart applying for jobs. I get one email from a company but I never managed to call them back.

During this entrie time, we regualarly call my parents and her mom/grandmother for money. For her kratom and her Xanax, because the Valium we got prescribed to her got stolen at the hookah bar and if she doesn't have some kind of benzo she has seizures. There are three dealers we see for the benzos and weed. Benzo Bob, Young Bob ad Dyrell. She claims that Benzo Bob used crack in the car while she was giving him a ride in return for a few pills. She swears that she kicked him out when he lit up the pipe. But I found Brillo in the car. And a pen that had resin on it. If she kicked him out as soon as he got in the car, then how did he have time to put the Brillo in the pipe and scrape it? But she swears up and down and I end up believing her. Because I love her and I want it to work out between us. Young Bob didn't have the Xanax one night and so sent us to some one he knew who gave us $80 worth of like benedryl pills or something. Also crack, which she swears she flushed down the toilet. Dyrell, who only sells weed, stops for a while because he thinks people are getting suspicious. In the end she ends up going to a few different people, Jag who she says she quit going to because he sells crack and Mike who she says only sells weed and pills. She stops going to all these people and instead goes to this guy named Mike, who only sells weed and pills, mostly Xanax.

One night, the Xanax she gets turns out to be Ketamine and she spends several hours freaking out. I beg her to let me take her to the hospital but she refuses. She hallucinates for hours, talking about the time she was given meth and raped, having very vivid flash backs of that time. She says she sees ""people"" at the edge of the bed, that they are telling her to kill herself and offering her razor blades. 

Finally, at some point in the morning she calms down and falls asleep with me and things go back to normal. Mike swear that it was an accident. She swears that she thought what she took was Xanax. 

Things continue on this way for a while, us getting money primarily from my parents. My dad gives me $150 for my birthday. She takes it, I tell her that she can use it too get Xanax because she only needed a few days worth because her prescription can be filled then. She spends $80 on Xanax, gets fucked out of $40, spends some on gas, kratum, cigerrettes and vape fluid. She also gets $20 worth of herion. I didn't know this at the time. I'm hurt but I don't say anything because I want her to be happy.

&amp;#x200B;

About a week later, she goes to Mike because we popped a tired and needed a new one, we were on a donut. Mike works at a tire place. He got us a good used tired and was going to install it for about $25. I got $100 from my parents, I tole them it would be $60 to fix it. She goes to Mikes that night to get weed and calls and tells me that shes going to take Mike  and this girl named Fay to the bus station to pick up Mike's friend. She comes home for like an hour before she leaves again to help Mike get a part for his car. She says shes going to help him fix it and he'll do the car for free. She goes and I hear from her a few time before I fall asleep. Wehn I get up in the morning, the first thing I do is call her. She doen't answer, it doesn't even connect. I start to panic and cry. Our land ladies husband lets me use his phone to call the actual phone number. I had been suing my ipad to call people, including her of course, over face book messenger. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally after maybe two hours of panicing, I hear from her. She answers on the cell phone, not messenger. he says that she doen't know why it wasn't connecting but that she would be home soon. No more then 20 minutes. It takes her nearly an hour. I try to call her multiple times, but no answer. FInally she gets home and tells me she had fallen asleep at Fay's house and had left in such a rush that she had left the phone. But if she had left in such a rush and had been so worried and upset at my crying to her over the phone, wh had it taken her an hour and why had she stopped for a soda? 

We end up in bed for a little while but she decided to go to an NA meeting before she has to go to training for her new job at an Italian resteraunt. She gathers up some clothes to take to Fay, gives me a kiss and leaves. Before she left the room, I realise that I have misplaced my ipad. I aske her to help me look for it but she says that she's going back to Fays to get the phone and that she'll call it in a few minutes and I can find it then. 

 I continue to look for the ipad. I don't find it. I use the husbands phone to call it over messenger. The call doesn't connect. I tear apart the room looking for it for hours and never find it. I also don't hear from my fiance, who I call repeatedly on the husbands phone. It always ends up getting forwarded after a few rings. At first I think she must be in the meeting, but she would have called me back when it was over. Or at least texted. I don't hear from her for hours. In complete desperation, I call the resteraunt shes supposed to be at and ask for her. They tell me that there is no one there by that name. At last I text the phone number that if I don't hear from her soon, I'm calling the police and reporting my car stolen and her mising. When I call again I get a response. It is not my fiance. 

The woman who answers tells me that she had bought this phone. 

I completely freak out. I don't know what to do. I know that she had stolen my phone and my ipad, my only real way to comminicate with my family. That she had done this convinces me that she's left for good and that I'm never going to see her again. I call my parents and tell them all this. 

They tell me to call the cops and report the car stolen. I do. 

While the cops are at the house, she pulls up. The cops tell me that because I let her have the phone and put her sim card in it, it wasn't legally considered stolen. That because she was back with the car, it wasn't considered stolen. And that I hadn't actually seen her take the ipad, they couldn't press charges. My land lady doesn't want to let her back into the house. But she has the address on her license and the police can't make her leave. 

My fiance is devastated. She swears that she went to an na meeting, that the phone was stolen out of the car, that she hadn't taken my ipad. She cries in the yard. I apologise. We go back into the room to talk. At some point, she tells me that even though the officer told me that they wouldn't press charges, another officer told her that they probably would and that she knew they probably would. And that he would end up in a male prison, murdered and raped. I can't take this and start to cry. She is pissed at me. I beg her to forgive me, that I didn't mean for that to happen, that I was sure she wasn't coming back. We fight for a while. I try to take the car keys to drive to the bridge, she doesn't let me. I even beg her to come with me to the bridge, to jump off with me. That dieing together would be better then her getting raped and murdered in prison, that I couldn't live with that happening to her and knowing that I was to blame. 

She ends up cutting herself on both arms. She takes the car again and disappears for about 30 minutes. When she comes back, she has cut up the other arm. She begs me to let her take my computer, my last way of commincating with my parents, and trade it for crack. That she was going to prison anyway. I refuse. 

 At last, we end up in bed and fall asleep, but not before she makes me promise that I won't go back to my parents. Not that I could if I wanted to, I didn't have a car or money. But when I woke up in the morning I had changed my mind. I wa going to find a way to get back to my parents. She freaks out, cries and begs me not to leave. I call my parents and beg them for money to get the car fixed, for a phone with gps, for gas money. They agree. They send $300 to the nearst walmart for me. 

Me and my fiance have a massive fight, she calls me a cunt, a stupid whore and she pisses on my things. She cries and apologises but I'm done. I pack my car and leave. I don't have any gas but I am lucky enough to make it to a gas station and the worker there is kind enough to give me $5 for gas. I get to walmart, get a phone but they don't have the right tire for my car. They find somewhere that does, but there is no way I;ll make it there befor they close. I have nowhere to go so I go back to the house. Also I wanted to see her again, I didn't want it to end the way it had. We talk and she admits to using herion. Not the birthday thing, I don't find out about that until later. She swears though that she didn't take my ipad. While I'm at the house, I misplace my wallet. I look for it in the car, she stays in the house to look for it in the bedrrom. We both look for it outside and she finds it and gives it to me. 

I make a deal with her, I tell her that I will think about coming back to Virginia if she can prove to me she can get clean, submitting to random drug tests that she has to take on video, she has to get and keep a job, she has to get a place to live and she has to pay the people whe had been staying with some money. She also has to find my ipad. I had believed her about her not taking it. I wanted to believe it because I love her. 

I end up going to a hotel for the night. While I'm chceking in at the hotel, I realise I'm missing about $80. I get in conctact with my fiance through the hubands computer and ssshe swears she hasn't taken it. She telss me that she has found my piad but she keeps making up excuses not to show it too me. At last she admit that she pawned it. I'm devatated. I tell her I never want to see her again, not to call me and I hang up. 

She calls me repeadtedly and I finally cave and answer. She begs me not to do this, that she loves me more then anything, that she'll change. I tell her that I'll give her a year to prove to me that she can change and get clean. She has to get my iad back, she has to oget and keep a job, she has to geet clean, she has to submit to random drug tests, she has to pay those people back and she has to get her own place. I tell her that I will come and see her before I leave. 

The next day I hear from my land lady that my fiance, who had told me that she could stay at the house, wants her out. I don't blame her. I talke to my fiances mom, who it turns out in a lovely person and had never done anything that my faince had said, that that had been her sister/mother and she had just lied about it, and we decide that he has to check herslef into a hospital as suicidal and detoxing and then get into a half way house. I make this all a condition of me coming back. 

I agree to take her to hosptal. While on the way there she admits everything. he admits to using that morning when I was so worried about her, that evening I called the cops, she tells me about the hookah bar and the birthday thing. She swears she never smoked crack though. Or stole the $80 from my wallet.

I get her all settled at the hospital and pick up my dad from the air port, he flew up so he could drive home with me. They gave me money to get the tire fixed. My fiance calls me from the hospital a few times and tells me that if they can't find her a bed, they'll kick her out of the hospital. Then she calls and tells me that she had misundertood, that they would just keep her in the er. Then we talke again and say good night, she promises to call me today. It's nearly 1:30 and I haven't heard from her. Her mom talked to her at about 4 in the mornig and she told her that she was going to be discharged at 6. Her mom called again at 9 and the hospital said she was still there but they wouldn't transfer the call to the room. I called the hospital about an hour ago and was told taht she wasn't there. 

I don't know what to do. I love her so much but I know shes going to hurt me again, especially if shes left the hospital and isn't in a half way house or getting treatment some how. I think shes decided my conditions aren't worth it and that she would rather do drugs. I'm pretty sure she has chosen drugs over me. I don't think I'm ever going to hear from her again. 

I'm going home to my parents and I'm going to try and rebuild my life.",06Oct2019,1
88,"I am in a really bad situation and I don't see a way out. I got my first job two months ago. The pay is OK, I will be getting a raise soon, coworkers are nice to me including the boss.

But I hate the job. It's not something I wanted to do, I find it extremely stressful, I feel awfully bad at it, the growing expectations make me scared shitless. I don't have the knowledge or skill to do it properly.

But I can't tell that to anyone. I need a job. Right now this is my only option. My boss and my family asked me several times how I felt about the job and I had to lie and say that I feel OK and that I enjoy it. Because how could I not say that? I need the job, I don't want to lose it. Why would my boss keep someone who says they feel they're not good enough, that they can't sleep because of the stress and they hate the job itself?

I'm leading everyone on but there is no other option. There is no job I would be good at or enjoy. So right now the plan is to keep doing my best and wait for them to figure out I can't do it and fire me. I will save as much money as I can and after they fire me try to find another job that I'll probably hate and repeat the cycle.

I knew it would and like this since I was 15. I had no idea what I want to do in life so I didn't have a chance to pick something I might even remotely enjoy. So now at 24 I have no skills and no passions. I am behind my peers in every way. I am ashamed of everything I do and everything I don't know. I feel intimidated by almost everyone. 

I'll just have to wait this out and hope I don't live long.",06Oct2019,1

92,"Hey all, just felt the need to put a few thoughts out on Reddit.

I'm 27, male and based in the UK. Good job and still living where I grew up (small coastal town). Raised Catholic but atheist for a long time now. I don't excercise at all (pulling a guilty face as I type).

From the outside I have few stressors in my life. I'm healthy, financially stable, single, have good friends and with very few commitments.

Thing is, I have no real drive and so many of my decisions are driven by fear. Often on the weekends I don't leave my flat...I don't have a good reason as to why. Going to work is fine. 

GP's diagnosed depression/anxiety in the past. Had CBT + counseling.

I'm gay but never had a partner. I worked hard to suppress my sexuality so I experienced relatively little hassle.

My mum died from cancer when I was 18. I kind of put my life on pause for a few years when this happened. Almost feels like I never resumed it. I occasionally think that I did myself a fair bit of damage at that time.. felt like that was the time to explore partners (I wasn't out at the time), push past comfort zones etc. I never did this and think I feel the effects now.

I struggle to be heard at work (physically), my voice is so quiet. I apologise too frequently. My friend once mentioned that it's almost like I apologise for existing. I think this ties into my self esteem. I feel such suppression of myself but I don't have the tools to fix it.

The core point I can summarise with is: I feel incomplete, if not a little broken to be honest.

My worry is that if I don't share this now..I will be the exact same person in 50 years, having led a life of isolation born from fear.

I guess if I'm honest...I'm looking for those people who resonate with aspects of what I've written. I want to know that others were able to move past this and 'grow' for lack of a better word. I want some hope I think.

I'd also be keen for thoughts on revisiting counselling etc. My problem is I never know how to approach it. This feels like quite a lot to throw at them haha. 

All this being said, as mentioned above I live a really privileged life and I enjoy being the clown in social situations!

Apologies as I know that I'm asking for opinions/help yet offering a tiny snapshot of my life. Could just do with some guidance is all.

Thanks for reading Reddit. It's greatly appreciated.",06Oct2019,1

was at a swinger party. had sex with a woman that i wasn't really attracted to. later on met another woman who is cute and fun i liked more. going down on her then when i go to stick it in its only semi hard, but she still enjoyed it. actually got soft while inside. then a week later i see her again. had sex with someone else then saw the one i like more. she gives me a blowjob and i am fully hard, while putting the condom on i get soft and cannot get hard. not sure if she thinks i dont like her or something else. she had a really disappointed tone of voice.

..the issue is, ever since i had some severe insomnia during the summer and only got 3 hours of sleep for a month my libido has dropped so much. also had some other health issues. im almost bored while receiving oral sex. been moaning to make it seem like i am enjoying it more than i actually am. i like this woman, and want to be friends. its not often i want to be friends with people. had planned to hang out before this most recent time and now im not sure its going to happen. asked her if we are still going to meet and she didn't sound so sure.. any advice is welcome",06Oct2019,0
101,"For the past several sundays and wednesdays, my mom has been asking me if I'm going to church. I always decline. I actually stopped going a while ago. She finally came to my room to ask why and I lied to her. Our pastor used to say that you don't even need to attend church to be Christian, so I used the excuse of just studying the word on my own. She seemed doubtful and still concerned. 

A few nights ago I was lying in bed on my stomach in a weird position, not moving but not asleep. She wasn't able to tell and while she stood in my doorway I heard her whisper, ""God, please help my daughter."" Needless to say, she'll probably be pretty upset if and when I ever tell her the truth. That probably won't be any time soon though.

So to keep this short, 2 or 3 days ago I started having an elevated and irregular heartbeat, something that I never had before. This didn't happen occasionally, it's happening all day. It's most noticable when I'm trying to sleep or sitting down. When I'm standing up I only feel it beating faster than it should, around 100 bpm, at least no palpitations.

Upon searching online, I couldn't find anyone with a situation similar to mine. I'm not feeling weaker, I'm not in pain, I don't feel like I am dying.

Background- I’m an Indian with Mongolian features. Currently in France for studies. 
So this morning, I went to Notre Dame at Rouen with my two friends A &amp; B. My friend A also has Mongolian features while B has Indian features.On getting inside, immediately an old man started a conversation with us. He spoke in French so we couldn’t carry the conversation much. But he asked us where we were from. Since my friend A &amp; I don’t look Indian, he was very confused. He then pointed at my friend B and said something which we assumed meant he wanted to pray for her. We thought he worked there since he was fully clothed in black. My friend A and I are Christians and we have a cross necklace around our neck while our other friend is still confused about her beliefs so I thought it was wonderful that this man wanted to pray for her. We assumed it was because he got the idea that she wasn’t a Christian. He pointed towards the chairs and told us to sit there while he prays for B. So A and I leaves and finds a chair to sit and we pray. While praying, B comes worriedly and says she wants to leave. I at first thought she was just being skeptical about being prayed for since she leans more towards Hinduism. We tried to ask why but the old man came again to call her so she ran away from the spot and my friend B went after her. He stood there and kept trying to call B. He then looked at me and asked me pray with him. He motioned me to stand at a particular point and he motioned me to bend/bow . I thought he wanted me to kneel and  pray because I do kneel and pray sometimes but he stopped me when I tried to kneel and made me bow. I kept thinking something was off because I had never prayed in that manner nor did I see anyone pray like that before. Then he came behind me and held me tight and I felt him. Hard.  Behind me. 
I quickly shrugged him off. I said I’ll sit and pray but he kept saying no no , that I was supposed to stand and bow and pray. I still couldn’t make much sense of what was happening. I didn’t want to think that it was what I was beginning to think it was because it was in the cathedral. Just then, some tourists happened to pass by. Immediately, the old man moved away and began praying. Seeing how he immediately changed knowing that there were onlookers, I knew I had to run. Everything happened in like a minute or two. My friend B said that he did the same thing to her.  We wanted to complain, we wanted to do something but we didn’t know where to or how to since we didn’t speak French. 
I didn’t want that encounter to ruin my experience at the cathedral. A suggests we walk beside this Asian family.The old man kept following us inside the church and kept whistling, motioning us to go somewhere. We wanted to leave but He stood at the exit for so long. When we saw this large Asian family leave, we quickly came out with them. We went to the cafe just outside the cathedral where there were a lot of people as we tried to process what had happened. That old man stood behind a house and kept peeking at us. When we were leaving, we spotted him again. He pretended to walk a few meters and then hid behind a wall. My friends and I were creeped out at this point and we ran very far away from that place. 
I still haven’t made much sense of what happened there. It angers me even more because it was inside a cathedral. I don’t want other girls to fall prey to him.",06Oct2019,1

112,"So when I was 20, I got diagnosed with PCOS. My hormonal imbalance has basically ruined my self esteem. My periods became irregular and stopped, I gained a lot of weight, acne, hirsutism and my depression set in. I’m poor and basically can’t afford therapy so I just tried to keep myself happy by focusing on other aspects of my life and worked on my weight loss. 

I was 240lb and I’m down to 190lb atm. This is amazing because my periods came back last year. My only problem now is I can’t keep a relationship with a man right now. I would say I am an attractive woman and my sex drive is very high...I actually really love sex but I usually just have dick appointment and leave it right there. Men have tried to date me or build a relationship with me and at first I’m interested but then I lose interest and push them away when I think about opening up to them. 

I know it sounds very vain but I have facial hair, chest hair, tummy hair and I get very hairy and this made me feel like I have to defend my femininity to people. No one has actually ever outright insulted me for my body hair but I’m very self conscious of it and it becomes worse when people notice it and call me out on it. I went out with a guy once and he pointed it out as a joke. I wasn’t angry but I just actually went home. I couldn’t be happy anymore. I learned to wax by myself at home just to keep it under control. 

There’s this guy that I’ve been talking to for a while. We went out once and we have had sex a couple of times. I really like him and he makes me happy. He’s really trying to get to know me and spend more time with me and I want to give in but I’m afraid he will get scared if he knew about my pcos and if he saw how hairy I got he would probably drift away or even reject me. I’m not sure my already fragile self esteem can take such a hit. 

Thinking about how I may also have fertility issues is also a bummer and I don’t know if I would want to tell a man I like and want about all of this. I don’t want anyone to pity-date me or look at me like their doing me a favor being with me. 

I have been single for about 6 years now and I’ve learned to enjoy my own company but it gets really lonely sometimes. I just wanted to know if there’s any advice I could get cause I really can’t afford therapy.

tldr: I have pcos and my hirsutism is affecting my self esteem and is making me avoid relationship with men.",06Oct2019,4
114,"I live in the northeast. I absolutely HATE the colder months. October through March are miserable and I absolutely dread them. 

I don’t like being cold. People are always sick. Germs go around my kids school. There’s nothing to do. It’s dark by 5 pm. 

I love summer. Long days, dark at 10 pm, being outside. Sunlight. 

My point is, the cold months absolutely overwhelm me. Does anyone else get this way?",06Oct2019,2

116,"I have recurring dreams about making up with my exes, or finding a random girl I’ve never seen before and we instantly hit it off. Last night I dreamed about having sex with Krysten Ritter and it was all great until I woke up heartbroken in my sad reality.

I had another dream last night about a girl I really fell in love with, but she always pulled my heart strings and eventually broke up with me. It’s been 3 years since I’ve been with her and my feelings really haven’t changed about her.

We were at a bar talking to people, I remember looking at her and thinking “Wow, this is going great, I can’t believe I got her back. This is my girl” and that’s all I remember.

Though, in real life, I don’t really have the desire to find someone new. I have a pessimistic point of view on dating; the fact that chances are, there will be some way she behaves that will turn me off or make me feel like I am not important in her life despite any length of time that I may know this hypothetical woman. Because I’ve been with quite a few women and it’s always been the same.",06Oct2019,5
118,"My life involved a lot of drinking after work. We would visit multiple bars and drink our night away due to the corporate culture of heavy partying. After a while, this became an unhealthy habit for me. I became a heavy drinker.

One day, I went home late drunk. Found my dog lying on the floor, shaking. I took her to the vet as fast as possible and luckily, nothing happened except for some plastic found in her stomach. The vet was a behavioural expert with animals. He told me that my dog was extremely lonely, which is why she kept chewing and swallowing plastic every time I came home late. This incident was so frightening that the next day after work, I didn’t even consider sipping alcohol. I went straight home to my dog. Took her for a walk.

The result was instant. She looked like the happiest dog in the world. Ever since, I go home straight away after work, drink less, and my dog is happier than ever. She doesn’t chew or create a mess around the house anymore. I got this advice from a friend of mine, who’s a behavioural scientist. He said this method replaced two bad habits through a “physical routine” and “pleasure.”

Drinking after work was a routine that I had to break. Keeping my partner happy and healthy was more important to me than drinking. His wellbeing and our healthy relationship was a form of pleasure.

According to neuroscience, connecting pleasure and physical action is extremely powerful. My scientist friend is part of a neuroscience subreddit, [r/newbrain](https://www.reddit.com/r/newbrain/) . If you’re interested in using science to solve habitual problems, you should check them out

119,"I have recently received more information about someone I know, and it worries me. He is known to be depressed, and lazy but his attitude is very off. Yesterday, he lashed out at his mother saying unacceptable things about her for no reason. His mother reset the router and it unexpicably infuriated him, he said you’re the worst mother ever, swore at her, and demeaned her in many ways. She told me after that he had a history of wishing she was dead, getting mad, and being lazy and unmotivated. Though she also told me that he would feel guilt, and apologize, sometimes seeming motivated out of nowhere. I’ve been around him before and he’s been happy, and nice, acting like nothings happened. I believe that he has dabbled in drugs in the past, and his friend was sadly killed, which could of had a mental toll. His family has provided him with a car, food, and shelter for his entire life. He is in his twenties. Can anyone help explain his situation? I am very confused.",06Oct2019,1
