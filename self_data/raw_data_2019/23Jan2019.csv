0,People smoke and drink all the time. My brother has asthma and he's been smoking since he was 20 (he's 38) and he's doing just fine. Teen girls get HRT pregnant and get on tv shows that pay for everything they need. Not to mention that I see tons of successful women talk about how they were teen moms and worked hard to succeed. It doesn't seem like a bad thing at all. Is anything really bad or unhealthy in reality? Or is it all just fear mongering?,23Jan2019,1
1,"I’m a new nursing assistant and gotta get a job. Hate this growing up shit lol. Anyways there’s about 5 care facilities close to me and only 2 are hiring. The first one is a genuinely good place for residents and id love to work there. Doesn’t smell of piss too! Unfortunately I know they aren’t going to hire me, can feel it. 

Now the other place that’s hiring I did my clinicals at. They have great benefits from what I can see but.. it’s very institutionalized, and not I place I want to work it. But it has good pay, so I’m very conflicted. The other place definitely won’t pay me as well as bad place. Plus I know for fact they’re low on staff so getting hired is more than likely.

The residents I remember were very nice minus that all male unit where my ass was pinched. I also have good idea about the unit I’ll be in as they mentioned geriatric patients. I did not like the Cna’s in that unit as they were lazy. 

Fuuuuck I really don’t want to go there, wasn’t even that bad but the cnas there are the only reason I don’t want to go! 

I’ll just suck it the fuck up and deal with it. I won’t be there forever. I need experience anyways. Goddamit.

2,"Okay first, I‘m german so this might be a little hard to explain and I‘m sorry if you don‘t really get what I‘m saying 

So basically what I mean is that sometimes in life I rather to a fun activity once instead of more often because then it will always be ‚that one time‘. And whenever you do something multiple times you mix up the memories and you can’t define when was what... is that too much living for the memories instead of the actual moment? (I‘d say yes)

Also I could never ever see myself in a ‚normal’ job because then I always saw myself doing that job for the next 40 years and became really depressed.  I kind of need a certain uncertainty to get sad because I don’t know what will happen and it’s interesting to find out",23Jan2019,1

4,"I have been living in my apartment for almost 13 years.  I met my husband 8 years ago and we got married 6 years ago, he immigrated from the US and moved in with me 4.5 years ago.

Every single thing in my life got better when he moved in.   Still is, still keeps getting betterer and more.

I worked between 50 and 80 hours/week for 17 years and had my last day at my job last week.   We are moving to the country.
The movers come tomorrow and on Thursday, our belongings, we and our 2 cats take the ferry and drive north to our new home.

With a yard and garden, with stars you can see at night.  These things are all dreams come true.

5,"**(SPOILER WARNING)**

When I first saw how Pink Steven was, in the latest episode, ""Change Your Mind"" I was so impressed that I decided to do a little cover of it on my YouTube Channel. That scream ""SHE'S GONE!"" absolutely struck me to my core, along with the whole scene between White Diamond and the gang. I can only hope I was able to replicate the spiciness of that scene.  I'm not exactly sure where this would go, and this isn't something I normally do, but I figured I could give it a go. This is a resounded audio clip and song cover of Steven Universe's latest episode. I did everything except the sound effects.

It just feels like nothings ever going to change, like I’m always going to be lonely. There’s really no point in trying to live a good life anymore because there’s no such thing as a good life.

When I look at other women around my age they never have any, or they have maybe 3 little stripes. I feel like a freak for having them, and can’t believe how unlucky I was to get such bad genetics. Sometimes I feel jealous because every other girl gets to wear swimsuits, shorts, or other skimpy stuff without worry and I don’t. I tried everything, including rolling needles into myself for months to get rid of them. People always say stretch marks are beautiful on social media, but in real life they don’t mean it.

18,"To clarify, I am a 16 year old male currently in high school.  Last year, one of my first interactions with this junior (now senior) girl was her reaching around my back and grabbing both of my breasts.  I was really uncomfortable and telling her to stop, but she didn’t.  I had to take off my backpack to get away.  I don’t remember how the situation blew over with other people.  I just remember that time passed and she asked if I hated her, to which I replied no (because I really didn’t).  Time has passed since then, and now we’re decent friends.  But on occasion she’ll grab me.  On my birthday when people were crowding around me, she snuck in and grabbed my left breast.  When we were playing an improv game, she did it twice in a way where nobody would notice, but I knew it was intentional.  I absolutely hate when she does it, but I can never find a good time to tell her to stop for good, especially considering she has some mental health issues and secretly thinks everybody hates her.  She does have a knack for being very touchy-feely with people, and has even done very extreme things to people (including fingering), although when I asked a person it was done to they said they didn’t really care.  She is aware that I don’t like that sort of contact, and she never does the extreme things to me, but these tiny moments of her grabbing me can really piss me off.  She’s not a bad person, but I hate when she does this.

I didn’t know where to post this, but I just needed to get it off my chest.  I really do enjoy being her friend, but sex and especially nonconsensual sexual contact is a serious thing that I feel isn’t being taken seriously.  I am in theatre, so I guess it’s sort of a stereotype to be like that, but it’s still a very big deal.  At least I think it is.  I’m just confused right now.",23Jan2019,1
19,"I am a 22 year old male. Fresh out of college. Working for a pretty decent company, and actually tasked with giving a presentation for new hires to everyone I work with.

Something like 200 people. I have to wear a full suit and tie even.

Last night, I dreamed I was giving the presentation. Everyone sounded impressed. Everything I was saying was on the money. Then, when I got to my key point, I heard snickering in the crowd.

The snickering turned into slight laughter. Then that grew into loud, uproarious laughter.

I felt air conditioning on my bare butt-cheeks.

I looked down and I was naked. But even worse, not even ""naked"". I was wearing nothing but a red tie and tube socks. You know the ones? The high white socks with red white and blue rings around the top?

My tie hanging over my bare, lily-white belly (not fat, but a rounded belly from snacking too much and never hitting the gym).

Everyone starts snapping cell phone pics as I desperately cover my penis and turn my plump white ""bubble butt"" towards the crowd and try to get out of the room, which is of course locked.

My boss, Ms. Silvan, gets up and says ""Next time I should hire a speaker who's dressed to impress!"" and SPANKS my naked ass as I woke up panting in cold sweats.

I know it's ridiculous, but the dream felt SO freaking real. I cringe when I think of that feeling of the air conditioning on my bare tush. I blush when I imagine looking down at my bare body. And the looks on the laughing faces of everyone in the crowd (especially Courtney in Finance ugh).

I confessed to my friend Ashley who laughed and said ""Well thanks now I'll never see you again without mentally stripping you down to your adorable tube socks. This is the funniest dream I've ever heard.""

Does anyone know why she finds this dream so hilarious? Why tube socks when I wouldn't even have that on for the presentation?? And why does it bother me so much if it's so impossible to happen???",23Jan2019,1

25," It all started with hearing the news that both of my grandmothers fell Ill. One in Germany, and one in Wisconsin. The grandmother in Wisconsin was far worse. Her Outlook wasn't very promising. It was devistating to hear, we're pretty close. 

After getting the news about my grandmother my girlfriend volunteered me to do work on our friends vw beetle. Just an alternator swap. They said they got it tested and it was bad. Fine then, that's not so hard. I double check the alternator and I see that it is in fact putting out power. Weird. I tell her but we decide it's better to be safe than sorry. After installing it shit started going haywire. Turns out it may have not been the alternator at all, but an external fuse box that sits on the battery with a loose wire. Cool. Re crimp the connector on the wire and everything's working great again. Until it wasn't. Turns out this alternator isn't putting out constant power. Great. Ended up having to jump her car. When doing so my hood didn't latch and after I drove off my hood flew open and dented either side of it. That's annoying. 

Immediately after my girlfriend and I decided to get breakfast. She hits her brakes and the car jerks. Fuck. Her brake pads broke and separated from the metal backing. Fuck. So the next day I pick up brake pads to replace them. As I'm doing the work her car falls off the jack (nearly on me) because I didn't use a fucking jack stand. I've been in the Auto industry before. I know better than that. I slowly raised her car back up and finished the work. 


A few days later the Wisconsin grandmother dies. I'm so distraught and besides myself that I tried going into work, which didn't last long. I had to leave and take some time off. That whole week, in fact. The day after I find out I'm doing work on my fish tanks. I have a syphon hooked to the sink and I'm cleaning the shit out of my 75 gal tank. After finishing I walk into the kitchen. Horror. Absolute horror. A disposable cup was clogging the sink. There was an inch of water in my kitchen. Maintanence came and had a company extract the water. It started draining to the apartment under mine. I went and apologized profusely. The lady likes me so she wasn't too upset and nothing was damaged. But my house was a wreck. 

As all this is happening my aunt posts that my grandmothers dying all over Facebook, at this point most people in my family hadn't been notified. Some of the family found out through Facebook and they we're livid. When asked to take the post down so we can talk to our loved ones she refused and deleted people out of anger. Later on, at my grandmother's death bed, as she passed away the same aunt tried to take pictures of my grandmother to post on Facebook. She passed with her jaw open in pain. My dad told me her face got stuck in a way that resembled the ""scream"" painting. Absolutely horrific. After that, the day of the funeral, before we put her to rest she texted the executor, my dad asking about when she can expect the money that my grandmother left. Wtf? 

After that adventure I finally got home. I was exhausted, hadn't had time to process anything. The next day my girlfriend was at work. Our mutual friend with the car problems reached out to me and asked if I could go and take a look. I said sure. She tells me about how my girlfriend had people over after I left that night, thinking that I already knew they were over. Turns out my girlfriend lied to me and only told me about our one mutual friend. She told the others to not tell me that they were there. What the fuck? Turns out she didn't want to tell me about it because she knew that I knew they were going to smoke pot. (I'm not against pot, I believe it can be a really great thing for people, but it's not something I'm in to and we moved in together under the agreement that no one would smoke/get high in the house) this wasn't the first or second time she lied to me when I was going out of town. Every time I'd go out of town she would do something behind my back. I had to call it right there. It was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. I wasn't happy. And I wanted to be able to trust her when I go on short trips for work. I shouldn't have to worry about what's going on in my own home while I'm not there. She broke my trust multiple times and I had to draw the line. She told me that by breaking up that I'm killing her. That she's already thinking of ways to end her life. I'm 23 and just ended a near 4 year relationship. 


Everything feels wrong. Every part of me hurts. It feels like it's never ending. I know it's a streak of bad luck, but I feel so discouraged in general. I know it'll be okay eventually, but I feel so alone. And its one of the worst feelings I can imagine. ",23Jan2019,1

A few years ago we weren’t on the best of terms &amp; I couldn’t bring myself to talk to you when I saw you. You texted me saying it hurt you, but you understood my feelings. You finished your text with “Oh, and have a wonderful birthday, I hope you get everything you deserve &amp; more.” The fact that you remembered meant the world to me &amp; we kept talking for a few months &amp; you said you missed me, you hate that you hurt me, but most importantly you said you’d always be there when I needed you.

32,"I fucking hate myself. I have this math test tomorrow and I'm woefully unprepared. I've been doing poorly in this class since the beginning, but I swore to myself that this quarter would be different. While I don't know the exact value, my quarter grade should be pretty good right now--I've been doing the homework and I did well on the last two quizzes we had. 

But I suppose that's all for naught, because I'm going to fuck it up tomorrow. Last week I had a quiz that I studied my ass off for. I met with my teacher all the time--twice in one day at one point. I finally understood the concept and passed the quiz wonderfully.

But then I had other work that started to pile up, and I stopped attending to math so diligently. Coupled with the fact that I take a really long time to do math work ('cause apparently I'm some sort of dumbass!), suddenly there's all of this new stuff that I don't understand is also going to be on the test. 

So on Thursday and Friday I'm scrambling to do it so I can meet with my teacher, but I don't even get close to finishing. At home, I'm trying to do all my other work. I don't go into her office on either Thursday or Friday because I feel too guilty to say I don't understand something while not having really done the assignments (which isn't logical, but I couldn't bring myself to do it because I have my moral compass shoved up my ass!). Then she tells us on Friday that this is the last time she'll see us before our test on Wednesday (tomorrow), because Monday's a 3-day-weekend, and Tuesday she has another obligation for the whole day. I figure that I'll be able to work my issues out over the three-day-weekend, which didn't happen. I think I knew subconsciously that I was not going to be able to do those problems. And now it's Tuesday night and I don't know how to do any of this. And not for lack of trying, either, but the more explanations I see the more it runs together.

Today, I email my teacher again looking for a last-ditch appointment tomorrow before the test, and she replies to me saying that she won't be in school until she gives us our test. I fucking hate myself. Why'd I let myself get complacent? I *know* I need to work my ass off in this class, but I guess I thought I could get around it. 

I've been on the verge of crying all fucking day (by the way, that's the worst. I just want to cry dammit). I'm scribbling some homework (gotta get those HW points, I'll need 'em!) and I wishing I wouldn't've been so naive. I swear to god I just want to finish this year and go to college.

34,"First of all for those of you who don’t know, Rory’s a YouTuber, Love Chat TV who gives advice on breakups and what not. He gives plans for going forward a well as general advice. His coaching calls are 87 bucks an hour which while not cheap, is a lot better than 399 for some others. And it’s worth it IMO for peace of mind.

So I gave him the breakdown of the situation, how we met, details about us, how long we were together etc. What happened, why she claimed to have broken up with me all that good jazz. As I’ve said before. I’ve felt hugely guilty lately for everything and felt like it was all my fault. He threw that out the window almost instantly. Told me that I had almost no blame in the relationship ending, that I did my best and that I was an angel boyfriend. Now again, I tried to bring up every fault that I felt I had and had done wrong to her. I.e posting for advice on reddit and a guy following her on Instagram and harassing her etc. 

Posting for advice on relationship forums is NOT a sign of weakness, it’s a sign of strength to admit when I don’t know something. When I’m lost and need help. It’s also a sign of care that I care so much about someone to come online and look for ways to help. He applauded me for that. He applauded me for a lot of what I dealt with and how much I really do love her. He calmed me down on a lot of things that had been making me feel anxious. He did however suggest to delete Reddit since this guy is so adamant on following me around.

Overall I feel A LOT better after speaking with him and getting advice. Knowing he’s been in a similar position to I, made things a lot better and more relatable too. I feel content with doing all I could have done at this point with her. I’m confident that I was a great boyfriend, that said there’s always room for improvement and I intend to work on myself for now with the what’s meant to be will be mentality. I have given this woman Two years of my young life and certainly would’ve given a lifetime. But I can’t control other people’s actions and their feelings, nor will I try to anyway. Won’t be expending anymore energy over it. I’ve sent plenty of emails and texts. Any person who knows you’re hurting, knows you’re struggling and ignores you, isn’t worth the energy or stress. I’ve sent about 8 emails now, like you told me to do. You’ve not replied. You’ve got me blocked on everything, so you can’t possibly be too concerned at this point. I gave you all of me, but it’s ok. It is what it is.

Over time I do hope she’ll be able to look back and think of us fondly especially considering everything we’ve been through, the moments I’ve been there for her and supported her through, promises we made, things she did and said as well. I accept that she’ll always be in my heart and will always love her, but I have to love myself too and accept I’ve given everything I can. Knowing that, I’m content.

My friend keeps me company

There was an awkward 30 min silence mixed in there and I hope they don't think any less of me as I talked about some really sensitive topics.

42,"I watched the ~3 min ""original"" video when it broke after an acquaintance linked to it in a comment, but never read or listened to any of the commentary in the media coming from either side.  Literally all of my knowledge about the claims and accusations about what people on both sides claim the videos show, have come from people talking about the story. 

I'm not going to watch the longer ""rebuttal"" video, because I don't need to watch it in order to be secure in the belief that there isn't anyone in the video that did anything ""wrong"", but there isn't a single one doing *anything* right either.

I won't apologize for holding a passionate anti-racism position. Those kids chanting and pantomiming the ""tomahawk chop"" in the face of a native American senior citizen singing in his native tongue is racist. Period. And even if you don't see it as directly racist, I would hope you'd find it at least abhorrent for other reasons. Even if the kids themselves aren't racist, their very actions ***in that situation*** were, and they should not be tolerated, minimized, or excused.

I've heard people say things like ""don't make their behavior out to be worse than it is.""

That's ridiculous.  I can't possibly make their behavior out to be worse than it is, because this is the worst that behavior gets without bloodshed or violence. 

Racist chanting has no place in my America. Ever. Period. 

Everyone keeps saying ""well yeah there's that, but...""

No. There's no fucking but.

That's where the story ends, because *that's* the story. But nobody is talking about the actual story because people won't stop talking about their fucking ""but...s"".

I'll say it again. Racist chanting does not belong in the United States. That's the story.",23Jan2019,1

46,"my brother recently took his own life almost two weeks ago. im really struggling with it, my mind has been running in circles trying to find answers. maybe im not in the right place to post this but i dont know. 

little bit of background, my brother and his wife were going through some things and decided to separate for a while. On the 12th my brother went to a friends house to hangout and got home around midnight. he called his wife to come over and she told him it wasn’t a good idea because they would end up fighting every time they talked/saw eachother. he hung up and sometime after that took his own life. 

last night, i had a dream about my brother. we were all gathered at my grandpa’s house and we were getting ready for my brother’s funeral. however, my brother was there. only the immediate family could see him. he attended the funeral with us, it was strange. i kept asking him questions.. “why are we telling people you’re dead when you’re not?” no answer. “how are you here?” no answer. “what happened, why did you do this?” he said “i just wanted my marriage to work.” and i said “you have to work really hard, it doesn’t just happen”  he replied “i just got tired of trying” and then he gave me a hug. i asked him what i was supposed to do now. he said “i dont know, im really sorry. i have to go” he gave me another hug and then left.

i had a similar dream about my dad when he passed last April. my dad attended the funeral with us, only i was the only one that could see him. when i asked him why he was there, he just laughed about it. there was a girl there, who was a close friend, she suffered meningitis and was in a coma when my dad passed so im not sure if she has been able to learn the news. she attended his funeral too, however, i was still the only one that could see her also. 

my biological father passed when i was 8, i had never met him. when he passed, i had a dream that he came to me and kissed me on the cheek. it felt so real that it startled me to the point of waking up. he frequented my nightmares, kind of like a knight in shining armor, saving me from whatever i was dreaming about.

I really don’t want to go to talk to a therapist because saying it out loud would make it real and I don’t want to be labeled as “clinically depressed” especially when it seems this whole generation is. I also really don’t want to have someone psychoanalyzing me even if it’s their job. My university has free counseling/therapists but in a way that makes it worse in my head.

First of all, I’d like to introduce myself, I’m known online as “Charrie Wong” but my true and “real” name is Charlton George, I’m a 15 year old boy, from England, UK. I started hacking well at the time if you can call it “hacking” when I was just 12 yr’s of age. I spent around a month DDoS’ing small sites ‘til my video game addiction kicked in and I started playing that uptil the age of my 15th Birthday where I started see’ing anonymous on the new more. I was just on/off visiting the AnonNews.org IRC for a few months until around mid-april when I started actually speaking to people about where to learn etc… of course my first ever “hack” was just a simple LOIC attack on a certain target at the time, I believe it was a Asian news website. I started growing a huge interest for hacking and would spend upto 7 hours a day reading eBook’s, tutorial’s, forum post’s and watching youtube videos. I bought a hard hitting shell booter and found I could hit easy targets offline and then starting being a freelance web designer where I earned a couple $100/Month making basic PHP/HTML websites for my family, friends and people online. I then started learning SQLi and produced my first deface on a website which was pretty damn easy… I continued watching video’s and reading tutorials until I knew how to code and setup a shell booter and solid botnet, at this point I started developing my booter (which has been known for developing attacks) and my team “The WongZ” I set about gathering people and working on a stream prank calling the FBI and other known organizations to viewers around the world, I got a good couple of donations from that and bought a VPS and domain for my booter instead of hosting it off my crappy old PC which I had converted into a server. I then worked with my tram, setting up a twitter, youtube etc and earned money by DoX’ing a HackForums.net member who had requested a paid DDoS of a targeted company, I then went on to hack medium sized websites to gain shells and buy VPS’s etc from my stockpile of around $2,000, I also had income from my pocket money each week of around 10 GBP per week roughly $15 - $18 at the time. I also invested in advertising and other things such as stocks etc, which some I still hold and are growing today (all under my mother’s name of course who had no clue at the time.) In mid-may I got caught.. after I had hacked into my school’s website and they had some how traced my IP, got the phone number from Virgin Media and proceeded to call my house where my 9 year old brother picked up and of course, gave my name away.. I got a police referral order for 6 months, where they would regularly check my PC.. BUT I had a laptop, netbook and other people’s/family’s computers at my disposal, I carried on to learn XSS and LFI which I then did my 1 day of LulZ in dedication of lulzsec, which targeted high priority targets for 1 day (the 8th of August) I had a small following at the time and I rememberd a quote from earlier form Sabu: “To control the media lie, troll or ignore them all together” – so I released a FBI lie which was a simple trick I had found on the website, which then got me a lot of recognition and almost doubled my twitter following in a day. I then released the “Actual Hacks” I had done, on PBS, BBC, GoodYear etc... which got me “in” with the crowd I am now affiliated with today.",23Jan2019,1
57,"I broke up with my 1st serious girlfriend a few weeks ago and it's been very painful. I had some really bad moods, overthinking shit that went wrong with my relationship and being a mess basically.

But last weekend I went out and had some really great times. I mean, friday was a normal drinking night, but saturday had me feeling fantastic.

First of all, because I talked with a few girls, and I felt very happy and confident in myself.

Second of all, because I spent the majority of the night talking with this one girl that I kinda had a crush on for a while now, but never paid attention to it due to having a gf.

What's even better is that it seemed to me that she also has a crush on me for some time. I mean, it always seemed like she looked at me in a ""different"" way if I can put it like that. 

Saturday night was the first time we talked a bit more than some small talk, and she did a few things that makes me be sure she likes me, but I was also drunk so I don't know.

I know you guys probably get a lot of ""love hurts"" posts on here but if I'm gonna talk about this, I'd like to tell anonymous strangers.

tl;dr skip to paragraph 5.

I guess I can start near the beginning of our relationship. We met in 9th grade, so around we were 15 years old. She was from the neighboring town and our schools merged for high school. I had made a friend from that town a couple year prior through football and other sports.it was a small town, less than 1 sq mile. So they're entire middle School was made by of ~ 25 kids. Eventually I got to know the group from the neighboring town well and became good friends with a lot of them. That was when our paths first crossed.

I'm going to refer to her as EZ (initials).

I went to my one friends house for a bon fire. I was introduced to EZ there for the first time. We had seen each other in passing in school but had not spoken to each other. She was a Polish immigrant. She had been loving in the US since she was 3 or so. She was emotionally cold to me that night. I later found out that she is always that way at first. At that point in my life, I was kind of a jock and a douche. I was dating some other girls who wasn't there. I started drinking a year or two earlier and started smoking around this time. I was acting out because of a shitty home life. I'll never forget this because it still makes me laugh, but that night, she decided to remove herself from the group around the bonfire. I felt it was because of my presence in the group. She moved to a hammock about 50 ft away. I walked right over to her in isolation and asked ""when you're having an orgasm do you think in polish or English"". She was gob smacked. She didn't answer the question, she just pouted as everyone laughed and she walked home. After that we didn't really speak much, even though we saw each other all time at parties.

 It wasn't until, about junior year of high school when she started dating a friend of mine that she REALLY had no choice but to converse with me. Plus we had a ton of classes together so we became pretty good plutonic friends. Skip ahead to the end of this year, this is when we really started getting close. The LAST DAY of my junior year, I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. Real bummer, I wasn't really able to play sports. I lost all my hair, but I was a person of very high spirits. I always laughed at misfortune of any kind.. EZ actually threw a party for me the nighy before my first chemotherapy session. It was titled on Facebook as ""[my name] please don't die party"". It was probably the best party of the summer. A couple kegs, a couple police appearances, no fights, about 100 friends. I don't think I ever thanked her directly for that. Anyway I was diagnosed as in remission the day before my senior year started. That was when I had the strongest side effects from the chemo drugs. I was having back spasms, so they proscribed me 5mg percocets because it was a pediatric hospital. However they fully expected me to take 15 mgs at a time, I was 17 years old and about 160lbs. Unfortunately, you give a child that likes to party, pain pills, they're likely to a use them. Which I did. I was on like 30-50 mgs of Percocet at a time. I went through most of my senior year of high school like this. I was a wreck emotionally and physically. But she was there for me more than almost anyone I can think of. He had 5 of 7 classes together. She carried all my books and papers to my classes. She did ALL my homework. The teachers even asked her on occasion for MY homework. Id pass out in class on the desk, and she'd always wake me up and try to keep my head on straight. One of the times I took 50mgs in school, she had to almost literally drag me from class to class with the help of another friend. Thankfully, after the doctor decided I didn't need pain meds anymore, I quit cold turkey, haven't had one since. She was still dating my friend. And I was dating someone too, someone different than previously mentioned.

After high school she eventually broke up with my friend and I was single but we became extremely close and fond of each other. However I was still emotionally and physically in a bad spot, possibly worse than before. I was well over 200 lbs, didn't go to school, excessive weed smoker, and would get angry very quick. I was living on my own at the time. But her and my friends would COME OVER EVERYDAY. We'd smoke and hang out. She would come over by herself a lot. Some days we'd go have a catch with a football or kick a soccer ball. A couple years later when we we're 21 going to bars, she'd get drunk and demand we do something nice together. Once we went to a nice dinner and crush a bottle of wine together. Another time we went to the Eagles game. Eventually my best friend,from a town about 30 miles from where we lived, was getting married. I didn't mix friend groups, and I still don't. I like keeping separate lives from when I need to escape one. I brought EZ as my +1. This part I've never told her. But it was that exact night I realized I had loved this woman. I can remember the EXACT MOMENT I had the epiphany. I went to go get drinks and she was on the dance floor meeting friends I've know since I was 7 and she acted so comfortable. On my way back from across the giant to we made eye contact and she smiled. I swear that was the moment, at that moment no one else was in the room.  I was seriously like a love song or romantic movie. We danced, laughed and enjoyed that night. I believe that was June. 

Fast forward to October of that year. She asks me on another date. I drunkenly agree. The next day I thought long and hard about it. I was going to tell her that I was in love with her. That whole time between June and October I struggled with these feelings. I dreamt about her, I thought about her all the time. I even started playing the lottery because I wanted to win, walk right into workplace and tell her to quit. Tell her don't worry about packing a bag, we'd buy all new clothes when we get there. And go to the airport and hopefully never come home. I wanted to tell her all this. So I planned date night. It was dinner and a show in Philly. We went to Spanish as in spain restaurant and then went to see the Book of Mormon performed at the Walnut Street Theatre in Philly. It was a lovely night, even thought it rained. Sly me brought an umbrella big enough for two. After the show we laughed and I drove her back home. I get to her house and I parked the car. I will never forget these damned words. ""EZ can I talked to you about something.."" she said ""uh oh"" and was visibly nervous. I turned my whole body to her and uttered the worst thing possible, while I held her hand, ""EZ, I love you, and I know you love me, but I don't think it's I'm the same way. And I need to not be hung up on you so we need to start spending less time together."" I to this day have no understanding of why those are the words that came out of my mouth. I've since chalked it up to my extremely low self esteem. I was years without being intimate with someone. I was WAY over weigh (still am) and had no confidence. I forced her to hug me and as she cried. She didn't even say a word. She got out of the car and ran inside. I drove off. We drifted really hard after that. I texted her asking if she would say anything about what I said that night, because she never told me how she felt. She never responded. We'd occasionally see each other at friend's events and we'd say hi and how are you and then avoid each other the rest of the night. I began, and in some ways still do, to resent her for never telling me how she felt. I felt I was owed at least that in closure. I didn't care if it was as I feared, that my love wasn't reciprocal, I just wanted to know. EZ and I had one personality flaw that worked for us. We we're emotionally closed off. Almost never letting people in past the surface. And I know it was hard for her to express her feels, because it was for me too, but I still felt like after all these years i deserved something more than nothing at all. Now, I kind of understand that she's probably upset I spoke for her and didn't just say how I felt. But thats how we left it. At this current time we do NOT speak at all.

Thank you, I don't think I've ever talked about this to anyone since it happened three years ago.

""EZ can I talked to you about something.."" she said ""uh oh"" and was visibly nervous. I turned my whole body to her and uttered the worst thing possible, while I held her hand, ""EZ, I love you, and I know you love me, but I don't think it's I'm the same way. And I need to not be hung up on you so we need to start spending less time together."" I to this day have no understanding of why those are the words that came out of my mouth. I've since chalked it up to my extremely low self esteem. I was years without being intimate with someone. I was WAY over weigh (still am) and had no confidence. I forced her to hug me and as she cried. She didn't even say a word. She got out of the car and ran inside. I drove off. We drifted really hard after that. I texted her asking if she would say anything about what I said that night, because she never told me how she felt. She never responded. We'd occasionally see each other at friend's events and we'd say hi and how are you and then avoid each other the rest of the night. I began, and in some ways still do, to resent her for never telling me how she felt. I felt I was owed at least that in closure. I didn't care if it was as I feared, that my love wasn't reciprocal, I just wanted to know. EZ and I had one personality flaw that worked for us. We we're emotionally closed off. Almost never letting people in past the surface. And I know it was hard for her to express her feels, because it was for me too, but I still felt like after all these years i deserved something more than nothing at all. Now, I kind of understand that she's probably upset I spoke for her and didn't just say how I felt. But thats how we left it. At this current time we do NOT speak at all.

Thank you, I don't think I've ever talked about this to anyone since it happened three years ago.

65,"So I just woke up sweating and really overwhelmed by what just happened. I just had a dream or maybe even a nightmare about something I have not experienced beforehand . In my dream I was being raped by a man who was stealing from me. What was weird enough that it looked so real and the location and the people who were with me are people I know so well. So in my dream, I was talking to my bff(male) and I brought my car. We were discussing something about my godparents whom we share a friend with such as their son is someone I grew up with. We found him and were talking in my car, while my god brother parked. I got out of the car with a purse and a man with a cast grabbed it. Instantly, I fought back to retrieve it, hitting him, yelling at him and I believe I was on top of him. The man kept hitting me with the cast on my face and drags me by my hair. I’m screaming yet no one hears me and I see one of the two people in my car see and try to help me. However, what I didn’t realize until someone helped me fight him off from my bag that I had no underwear and the man’s pants were on the floor. I started screaming and crying so hard that I woke myself up. Another crazy thing during this “dream” was the place I was in because I was getting viciously attacked and raped in front of my old childhood apartment complex in San Francisco. Sorry, I just was looking for anyone who believes they can decipher it. Like I looked online and it said I’m feeling powerless. ",23Jan2019,1

i used to believe in money and success. i created a company, made a million and got my taste. i got bored from it. it didn't satisfy me after certain point.

i used to search for truth. i gave religion a shot, i researched and practiced religion, then i felt the existence of god temporarily. i quit believing after some time. not sure why.

68,"I’m no expert, but I’ve had several events happen to me which have shaped me into the person I am now, and at only 14 I feel as though I can confidently say I’ve learned a lot about life and have had many negative experiences teach me a lesson. Also just a warning, this is gonna be extremely long and it’s just supposed to be like a journal entry or something just so I can put what’s happened to me and what I’ve done in words.

I have been lightly traumatised by an extremely bad experience at a school that I attended for 2 years. I was the butt of everyone’s cruel jokes, and I had to put on a facade of the fall guy just so I wouldn’t be torn apart. The only thing that got me through was my family, music and my own willpower. My attendance got as low as 52% and as high as 75%. I missed so many days, at least one a week and people always gave me a hard time about it. I always had to make up an excuse like ‘I keep getting sick’ or ‘I’ve got a chronic illness thing going on’. I could never open up about what was really going on. It felt like leading a double life and it was exhausting. I was also in a toxic friendship which gave me psychological issues which made me feel like I was a liar, even though I wasn’t.  I literally had no real friends, and I was literally just ‘that guy who’s not at all noticeable and is just there for the easy target’. 

I was called ‘nigger’, because I was not white-looking. I don’t have dark skin or anything, and I guess I could pass as European but I look way more Arab. I was called ‘faggot’ for not using homophobic slurs. It literally got to a point where people were spitting on me and wrestling me, strangling me and kicking me in the balls. I didn’t really tell my parents, and I usually toned it down a lot so they wouldn’t worry. One kid in particular was much smaller than me, but would jump on my back, strangle me and grope my balls, which hurt immensely. I let him hurt me, as I’m gentle, despite being lanky, and being used to fighting (I have two brothers), and I can definitely take a punch. Eventually I had enough and grabbed him by the collar, lifting him literally off the ground and slamming him into the brick ground. I was furious at that point, and I did it out of pure rage. Luckily no one saw, and he fucked off after that. I learnt a valuable lesson there - when you’re cornered and stuck, fight with all your strength. Hopefully you can scare whoever is bugging you away with your fearlessness, and at least you will give them a taste of their own medicine. 

I talked to my parents after a few more incidents, and after a long and shitty procedure, I moved schools at the end of the year. I am much more at home at this new school, and I’d even say I’m quite popular. I don’t have to pretend that I’m someone else, but I don’t need to tell everyone that I’ve gone through so much shit. Despite struggling with severe depression, anxiety and physical pains from my mood, I’ve come out the other side. I will always be a generally blue person, but I can find the people and things which help me. Hell, I think I’m popular with the girls, thanks to my family’s history of being real charmers. 

All I can say is that even though I was changed forever by this experience, I’m glad it happened. I’ve changed from a naive little boy to an aware not so little but still young boy. I still have slightly low self esteem, but I tend to focus on my positives. I know I’m good at helping people and knowing what to say, I know I’ve got a positive energy that my mother describes as ‘healing’, I know I’m creative and imaginative, and I know I’m not too ugly (in fact a group of girls a grade above me mistook me for being their age. I guess that’s a compliment?). I’m just glad that shitty part of my life is over. ",23Jan2019,1

82,"I saw some post talking about a girl who committed suicide due to her parents, and I'm still really fucking pissed at how my life turned out, so I figured I'd make this post. People make jokes about crazy Asian parents and think it's hilarious, but the problem is that 1. a lot of the actions would be considered child abuse and 2. it's not actually jokes, it's true in a lot of cases, but kids don't know how to handle that so they make jokes about it.

I don't really know how to get statistics on how common casual child abuse is in the Asian community but I'm going to bet on it being incredibly common in families with immigrant parents. Examples from me:

* Isolation &amp; elitism - not allowing the kid to interact with other kids, ""all those other kids are stupid, you shouldn't be friends with them""
* Racism - ""all (insert demographic) people are criminals/unintelligent/lazy."" 
* Ridiculous expectations - got 100%? Silence, no acknowledgement. Got less than 100% even if you really tried? You're a fucking moron because we learned this shit in (insert lower grade year here) grade and it was so easy.
* Discrediting accomplishments - oh you made an honest mistake on a thing you're typically good at? You should be ashamed of thinking you're good at that thing, you wouldn't have fucked it up if you were actually any good so you must be lying about being good at it. You're good at nothing and completely useless.
* Materialism - no such thing as hobbies and passions, everything you do has to add value to your resume and you can only go into a handful of highly profitable majors. 
* Scapegoat for blame - something broke in the house/they can't find something? Oh it must be your fault, it totally couldn't be their own fault for doing something dumb.
* Gaslighting - oh I accidentally called you dumb for repeating something I said? No I never said that, you made that up yourself, so you're still dumb
* Anger issues - You closed the car door wrong? You asked a question while I was trying to read this map? Cue 3 hour screaming rant.
* No such thing as health problems - there's something wrong with your teeth? There's something in your eye? It must be because you waste so much time playing games/watching TV/staying up late. If only you'd spend more time studying and go do bed early, you'd feel better.
* No such thing as mental health - you feel depressed? Go kill yourself. 

Things I heard from/about other kids:

* Getting beat up
* Parents purposely humiliating them in front of classmates, though this probably falls under isolation through indirect means

I'm an adult and on antidepressants now but a lot of things are still fucked up, like how I'm not very good at interacting with people. I don't know how to fix this and save the other kids in this situation (and I know there are other kids because I've seen some of them post on reddit) because it's just the way things are. There is quite literally a zero percent chance of getting the parents to change because it's not that they don't know what they're doing, they just look down on how white people do parenting. And if anyone interferes, they're just going to send the kid back to their original country where there is even less oversight. ",23Jan2019,1

It’s been about 7 months and I am left questioning my decision to join this company, which, as an outsider looking in, looks great. The people are mostly nice, but have awful communication and social skills. Email is used and abused here to the point that it is simply not possible to maintain a clear inbox. There’s as much communication via email as there is miscommunication. 

I’m no communication pro, but I’m not a moron either. Yes, sometimes I might be unclear. But I will always correct it in a cordial and apologetic way.

95,"So, story time. I am 22 years old and still living at home (desperately want out but can’t currently afford it). I  live in a VERY small tourist town, less than 300 people. I moved out for a bit to go to college but I moved back home in 2017. My parents are very conservative. To give you an idea, they listen to Rush Limbaugh and have transistor radios in almost every room in the house, broadcasting it....every day. It drives me fucking nuts. My mother and I have never been close. We fight pretty consistently and after going to Al- Anon meeting recently, I’ve realized that a lot of my anxiety, anger, and confusing emotions all boils down to my upbringing in an alcoholic home. My mother is a major alcoholic and has HUGE insecurity issues she refuses to work through because she doesn’t see the point or worth in herself. Growing up, after I would come home from school or being out with friends, my parents would be sitting in the living room, watching TV and drinking. Every single night. Even now when I come home from work at 6:00, I know that’s what they’ll be doing. My mom gets really loud, obnoxious and confrontational when she’s drunk. From an early age, I learned to avoid it by hiding in my room. Still do that. Growing up and even now, it’s hard to explain my emotions and I get angry and shut down. My mother will try to talk to me when I’m upset, even when I don’t know why. all I can say is “nothing is wrong”. She gets angry that I won’t let her get close, I feel like she doesn’t really listen to my problems when I do confide in her and she just tells me the same stories about HER abusive childhood over and over. She also tells me any feeling I have is something that everyone feels and that I should just “take a walk, get over myself and think about someone else for once”. She has lied to me about drinking wine that I brought home from work and even drank a $70 bottle of wine I bought and I was saving for when I move out. She knew this. She told me the next day that I shouldn’t be upset because she puts a roof over my head and feeds me. I understand this but it still makes me feel stupid. The other night, I helped her put groceries away and she would hand me things and actually feel like she needed to tell me where everything went. She still even feels like she needs to remind me to brush my teeth at night. It’s humiliating and embarrassing. I told her that I’m moving out in the summer as soon as I get a job in the city and an apartment. She says she thinks it would be good for me but I can “always come home and regroup”. My brother lives in LA and almost everyday, she brings up that she wishes he would come live at home. He’s 24.  I am just beyond frustrated and can’t wait to leave. It’s all so confusing because they love me and would do anything for me but I just can’t stand living here anymore. It’s sucking the life out of my soul. Does anyone relate?
