1,"My whole life I have struggled with mental/anxiety disorders, including excessive anxiety, panic attacks, agoraphobia, harm OCD, and social anxiety. I often feel like I’m potentially a serious, severe danger to my loved ones because of all of this. I came into this world harming my loved ones both physically and mentally/emotionally: both my mom and I nearly died in childbirth and for months after we were both close to dying, and both my parents suffered great anxiety and sadness during this time, all of which today leave permanent scars which I know I’m responsible for. My whole life I haven’t been able to open up or be my true self. From the earliest days I can remember, I was severely bullied and hated by kids because I struggled developing due to my very premature birth. While I am normal now, I do believe that all has impacts on me that I’ll have for my entire life. One effect of it was my retaliation against not only those who I felt were extremely mean to me, but also those who I had presumed would  be mean, so basically everyone. Trying to be my real self, my own person, I faced much hate, much of this bullying, and so I defended myself, which led to even more haters and bullies and what not. Then, I decided to instead close myself off from nearly everyone, but I still had and still do have to this day fear and recognition that I am a danger, a harm, a threat, etc. to everyone. I could never accept or embrace who I truly am, even with family, out of recognition that it will only lead to harming others. I know I’m a danger and I only want to protect those I love. I can’t let go of the part of me that is a danger, because it is ingrained in who I am, in my mind, with my permanent mental disorders, especially my harm OCD. I know that there will come a day when I just can’t take it anymore, my emotions will get the best of me, even though I have successfully concealed them for so long, and when they’re released I’ll be a real danger/harm. I love my family and friends, but I am not gonna let that love blind me and not allow me to see the truth, that what has been in me since the earliest days of my life, the extreme mental/anxiety disorders, is a danger. I came into this world harming people, and ever since then I’ve been a harm to people. I’ve tried to manage it, tried to conceal it, tried to manage my emotions, tried to not let my emotions come out, etc. but in the end no matter how hard I tried, even keeping myself away from people, I’ve still failed, I’m still a danger. I’ve struggled with people; I don’t trust myself. I don’t trust other people. I don’t want to harm other people. I’m afraid of situations where I can lose control and act out and be that harm I fear I am. I want to be free of this pain, this fear. The only problem is the only solution is sacrificing everything I love and letting go. Not so much letting go of my love for my family, I’ll still always love them, but let go of the fear, the pain, the emotions. I need to stop concealing it all. Only then will I be who I am meant to be. So that fixes one part of the issue: embracing it all will allow me to be myself. But the problem still remains that I’m a serious danger to my family, and that is why fear will always stay with me, unless... I leave them. I surely do love my family, and that is why I must isolate myself, for their own safety, for their own good. I’ve harmed people since I was young, then I concealed what led me to harm people, but pretty soon it’s gonna explode, so the only solution is to leave and isolate myself.

I’m sorry for the rambling, and theres a good chance some may be confused, so let me know if you have any questions.

Any advice? Thank you.

TL;DR: What should I do if I feel I need to isolate myself from my friends, family, and everyone for not only my own good but actually more so their own good? How should I go about facing my future?",07Dec2019,1

Since years I’m sometimes having months where I really want to die and where I hurt myself. But then, there are times where everything is ok. When I was little, I also wished to break my bones and land in a coma.
I hate attention though, so I never really said it out loud til today. My mom thinks it’s normal.

8,"My mother and I were so gung ho for Christmas. It was our favorite time of year. We loved it. We’d look at gifts, at decorations, watch the cheesy TV shows.

However, I think this is the hardest Christmas for me this year.

My mother was very ill and September she decided to quit dialysis. She was so sick and tired of being sick and tired and I don’t blame her one bit, and ultimately supported her decision to go into hospice. What kind of life is it to sit for 4-5 hours a day in a chair having your blood pulled from your body, pushed back in, 3 days a week? If you’re lucky you get one day you might feel good.

I don’t blame her decision one bit, and when she told me, a Friday and I had just gotten out of work and brought her supper, she was happy. I won’t say excited, but happy. She was taking the reigns of her life back and allowing herself some dignity.

The next day, Saturday she would come home from hospital with hospice. Monday morning I would be taking her wedding band off her finger to give to my sister. 

It’s been a few months and it grief comes in waves, and today i would be hit with another one. We’re decorating for Christmas and I would walk to the living room where we’ve hung stockings and in the middle of everyone else’s would be mom’s sticking, with a black bow pinned to it.

Nonetheless, I have lost my mother, I’ve lost a friend, a confidante, my rock. 

I feel a piece of me is now missing and I guess one could say I feel, ever so slightly, lost.

Well. Happy Christmas, I guess",07Dec2019,1
10,"Few months ago, I came across this one girl and my life probably changed, we started talking and we hit it off, we used to talk everyday, all day, all the time, we had this incredible chemistry, not just emotionally but physically as well, we decided on hooking up, that's where things started going down for me, started to catch feelings for her, we weren't exclusive so she hooked up and made out with a friend few times, this was a month and a half after we began toxic and I have not been able to let it, from that point onwards, the next 2 and half months, we had constant fights and arguments because of that one reason, my insecurities were creeping in again, I was questioning her constantly about the same if she mentioned that guy, she is still friends with him and went to dinner Friday night, and my anxiety attack started peaking, I freaked out and I injured my back in the process while at the gym, in the last few months after her hook up, I have not been able to attend my college, been 3 months now, we've been constantly fighting and she has called off whatever we had citing she was drained, and I don't blame her for that, I have turned incredibly toxic, I even asked her friends if she is sleeping with that guy, breaking her trust in the process, I'm not sure what to do. I just lie in bed all day, doing nothing but overthinking about this situation, crying and regretting the things I might have said to her, it's hard to deal with this, I'm finding it difficult to sleep, I feel choked up, I have an important entrance exam next month for my dream job but I've not studied anything for it, hell I've not even filled the application form yet and today is the last day.

13,"Fuck Quora. What a stupid fucking website. It's literally the exact same thing as yahoo fucking answers, but because the web design is better people actually trust it for some fucking reason.



Every time I use the internet to look up any factual question OR anything about advice/emotions, google is trying to shove this stupid fucking piece of shit website down my throat. 



I look up how to do ANYTHING, and the first result I get is glorified yahoo answers. I scroll down. More shitty questions from the geniuses over at quora. It's like I don't have a choice, and I'm not going to wade through pages of google to find another source, so I bite the bullet and click on a question. It has one answer that explains nothing and isn't even tangentially related. I see another recommended question about what I want to know. I click it and THE FUCKING USELESS PIECE OF SHIT QUORA MAKES ME SIGN UP FOR THEIR STUPID MOTHERFUCKING WEBSITE. AND THEN IF GOD FORBID YOU SIGN UP THEY SEND YOU FIVE FUCKING EMAILS ABOUT LITERALLY EVERYTHING YOU CLICK ON. 



Whenever someone asks for advice on life problems you get two types of answers: ""THIS IS YOUR FAULT YOU HAVE NO ONE TO BLAME BUT YOURSELF FOR NOT BEING HAPPY. IF YOU ARE DEPRESSED YOU'RE JUST NOT MAKING THE EFFORT AND DESERVE TO STAY DEPRESSED."" and ""Try running and going outside more!"" 



Asking about non opinionated things isn't any better. Every chucklefuck on quora words their answers so smugly, like they should be applauded for helping someone on a website literally designed for answering questions. Even worse are the assholes that shit on people for not knowing things. I saw a man literally questioning if a HIGH SCHOOL JUNIOR should be pursuing an ENGINEERING CAREER because they couldn't do a BC CALC PROBLEM. Guess what, dipshit? It's a fucking question forum. You acto so smart and yet you apparently can't figure out that if there weren't kids trying to learn calculus, you wouldn't have anything to do to make yourself feel smart all day. 



Their users are literally the most pretentious fucking assholes in the world. All any fucking quora uses wants to do is brag about their life, accomplishments, degrees or their stupid fucking iq they got from an online quiz. I genuinely wouldn't be surprised if half of all people on that website were MENSA MEMBERS. They're that level of pretentious. Every man on quora acts like his opinion is the word of god, and that they're so obviously right they would never need to prove anything they said unless they were talking to an idiot. ""Source: I was the top of my class in US History in high school"" IS CONSIDERED LEGITIMATE BY THESE BUFFOONS.



Literally everything about quora fills me with pure rage. The design. The public perception. The popularity. The answer quality. ESPECIALLY the users. Fuck. Quora.

My ex is extreme in terms of his behavior. He recently got diagnosed and it makes so much sense. I have a very hard time communicating with him. He doesn't acknowledge boundaries, he's extremely aggressive and mean, he is just extremely up and down constantly.
We have children I can not block him. We are going to court and this will be brought up, but until then he blows my phone up every day from morning till night and sometimes all night.
The reason he is my ex is because he cheated on me with someone very close too me. He moved out. Shortly after she stopped taking to him. He snapped and it's been down hill since.

20,"Firstly, I’m sorry if this post is a bit out of place among a bunch of positive posts. Heck, it might not even be allowed on this sub. I just don’t know where else to post this. 

Tonight my mom got drunk. Normally I wouldn’t get mad at her, she does it almost nightly anyway, and it’s not worth getting mad over someone just getting drunk. 

Following that though, she took my (twin) brother as her designated driver, to go pick up her friend so they could pick up booze at a store. My job in this stupid scenario is to hold onto my dog so she doesn’t wake up my dad. If he does wake up then my (drunk) parents will start fighting. 

This whole situation just feels so stupid. I shouldn’t have to spend my night holding onto my squirmy dog so she doesn’t wake up my dad (the issue there is my dad doesn’t like my mom leaving without his permission), so my mom can take my brother to pick up alcohol for her drunk friend.

22,"A [recent incident](https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2019/12/06/education-ministry-investigating-video-of-negaraku-sung-in-mandarin-video/1816821) has erupted in Malaysia where students in a school sung the national anthem Negaraku in other language. I feel like I have to speak out on this considering that the school involved was once the one I attended during my childhood.


I don't see anything wrong on that as they had retained the meaning of the song after translation. Despite the fact that the video is made over a year ago and it was actually not an 'official function' those from 'U Make Noise Only' party still had managed to exaggerate this up just like they did numerous times on anything remotely 'Chinese'. It's as if they're just too weak to be not triggered by any small things like this.

In healthy democracies like America people are allowed to sing Star Spangled Banner in other languages and perhaps if you went so far to 'take a knee'. Belgium as a multilingual constitutional monarchy and they officially have 3 languages of French, Dutch and German to chose from when singing it.

I just can't understand that after we had voted in a new government on May 2018, we still can't accept the fact that we have to *let it go* and be more than that. As long as we did not break the metaphorical enchanted forest's bubble and walk out of it in terms of mindset, I doubt that we'll be any different from where we are during kleptocratic BN's time.",07Dec2019,1
23,"It was 2016 my girlfriend of 4 years and I split up. I was heartbroken, starring at our pictures every night drinking rum and crying until my nose gushed out blood, starring into the mirror at how ugly I thought I was. I had been with her since I was 19 and hated the feeling of living alone. I signed up on MeetMe to look for some chick to hookup with and get some strange. I started talking to a few girls and added them on Snap Chat on a Friday night. One in particular caught my interest because after 3 snaps she said ""do you smoke?"" and sent a lap pic with a bag of weed and pipe showing her panties and had sexy flower tattoos on her thigh. I said ""hell yes I do I got a quarter of loud where you live?"" I Googled the location and it was 45 minutes away I hopped in my car and started that way.  On the way I was sending her dirty pics and she sent her jaw dropping selfies of her laying on the couch showing everything her mamma gave her. I pressed the gas pedal to the floor and told her not to fall asleep swerving all over the high way looking at these stunning photos. 

When I got to her apartment I knocked on her door and this short THICK long brown haired green eyed chick with snake  bites opened the door wearing a long Billabong shirt that barely covered her panties and invited me inside. We sit on her couch and she turned on Red Hot Chili Peppers on her bluetooth radio. ""So did you drive this far to catch a buzz or do you want a little more fun?"" I told her ""I'm down for both"" and she laughed while she bent over to pick up the bong next to the couch, showing off her black lace panties and nice ass. She was hot enough to make any man believe there is a God. No star dust or monkey created this piece of art. 

She told me to get the grinder off the side table and grind up what I brought so I did. by the time I was done she passed me the bong after she took the first hit.  I sparked it and took a big hit and it tasted like dirt weed. I blurted out ""Damn I can already feel it!!!"" extremely loud and didn't mean to. As I was about to clear the bong I felt a surge of blurriness hit me like a ton of bricks and the music faded out. I look at her and say ""That was just weed right?!"" she said ""yeah and a little DMT"".

I began to panic, I didn't know what DMT was really, and after a couple minutes tried to speak but it wouldn't come out. Everything was super glossy looking and my heart started beating like a drum. I leaned my head back and closed my eyes and felt like I was doing a triple back flip off top of a cliff.  My arms felt really heavy and I couldn't lift them. When I turned to look at her my vision lagged and was struck by TERROR. Like the terror victims in Saw films experience. Like when you wake up from a nightmare screaming. Like having a fucking gun pointed at you and you can't run anywhere. I tried to tell her to help me and she was laughing saying she was sorry she didn't mean to mix that much in it. 

A knock on the front door and two guys came inside. One walked over and sat next to her on the couch the other sat next to me and they were LAUGHING at me. I asked them to help me please. help me! help. And he didn't say a fucking word but laughed even harder. She grabbed my weed I had in my lap and loaded up the bong and started smoking with them. I was asking them if I was in hell, what did I do to get here. Hell I think they felt more sorry for me than she did. At this point I was hyper focused on my breathing, feeling like I was paralyzed in a car wreck and waiting for an ambulance to arrive. Forced to watch her and the guy who sat next to her make out on the love seat across from me because every time I closed my eyes I would see a panorama of mountains starring at me like the Eye of Sauron in the Lord of The Rings. My mind knew I was experiencing death, and God Damn is it scary. My stomach felt as if it was made out of leather and I attempted to tell them I am not part of the couch not to sit on me but I was just making retarded stuttering sounds.  I started screaming and they told me to be quiet I am going to get to police called. 

Still moaning because I was seeing psychedelic patterns similar to the ones in the old school Windows Media Player. I opened my eyes and she opened up a little metal lunch box and asked if I wanted some Valiums to calm me down. I nodded and she told me to open my mouth and poured a few in. After a few minutes I started chill and blacked out. That is all I remember. I was woken up by the guy and told I got to go, he helped me to my car and I went back to sleep. I woke up to the sun rising I wanted to walk up there and kill all of them, I could of called the police but I am going to get in trouble too and it's not like I was raped I was robbed. My hands were numb for a week after that night and I will never smoke with a stranger ever again. The next girl I hooked up ended up being much fatter than she was in her pics and her vagina smelled like tuna and road kill. But I tapped it and felt better. After that I was finished with internet dating, a few  months later I met my beautiful wife and look back and laugh at it. My advice is to go to a party or bar and get laid, stay off the internet.",07Dec2019,1
24,"**Throwaway for obvious reasons. This is a theory and I'm not going off of much. This is my opinion and to a lesser degree a semi-journalistic piece.I believe what I am about to claim is with out defaming and slanderous intention. I want to protect a child.**

The Gamer Monkeys is a Youtube channel consisting of a father and daughter, who I will call A. They make comedic animations and live action skits pertaining to the popular series Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

A is between 3-5 , for context. 

Many people in the comments say we need to ""protect"" her and the father recently made a community post saying some thing along the lines of "" I want to raise A to be the most wholesome Jojo fan ever"".

I am thinking that the father is doing a couple things. I think he is trying to make her a fan of the series when she does not want to, but just pretends to want to. This is something that Jojo fans do,contributing to the cult-ish vibe the community gives off at times.

On a popular QnA site I posed a hypothetical question about children watching Jojo. Many people were disgusted I even asked that.

A seems to know a whole lot about the series,like she's been force fed it her whole life. I sometimes wonder if the father had a child just to make her an obsessive hardcore fan of this series?

You may ask what's wrong with a kid watching anime or being introduced by a parent. Well for starters, parents dont have any obligation to make or suggest a child watch something, except maybe if it's educational or for her homework. Not the case here.

I do not want the child groomed using anime,Jojo or not, buy a parent or the internet.

Luckily I have not seen any predatory or hurtful comments posed at A.

I think this is a big deal because she is obviously being forced at least a bit, used for views, and is very vulnerable as she is a very young girl. 

Also, I don't have anything against anime in general. I enjoy anime.

I guess I worded this better in my head. The series is very violent,sexual, mature and contains lots of very strong language,gore,body horror, weird fetishes, homoeroticism, every type of abuse to children and animal,especially young girls (and boys) being/almost being molested and so many animals being killed in cold blood and mutilated.

I'm having trouble wording what I'm getting at.

I'm not trying to parent A, I'm doing what's right.

some things he has to say and do are very innappropriate. I dont think the stuff in the series should even be described to her.

I'm 35.
I haven't been invited to a party, gathering, shindig, or a hootenanny in 14 years.

32,"One of my best friends has an amazing fashion sense. We both live white noise black market. Whenever I know I’m going to see her, I try to put on an outfit to one up her. But she always has nice accessories like long earrings and she curls her hair everyday. I want to be know as the most beautiful. But I’m usually known as the most funniest girl, I love making people laugh. Anyway, I do like how she makes me try harder at dressing nicer and I see it as a mini competition too. It just seems like she doesn’t have any hardships in her life. A sweet boyfriend, a good g.p.a. And she knows she wants to be a philosophy professor.

34,"I've been in solitude for a while now. It really started after I got diagnosed with my mental illness in 07. I had one friend I felt safe with and could go to his apartment for short periods. For the last ten years or so I've become a complete recluse except for the occasional AA meeting. 

Tonight at my AA meeting my friend asked me if I wanted to go with them to Matts apartment. I declined out of habit.

These last two weeks I've been taking baby steps to venture back out into socializing. I've been texting at least one person a day. Every one of them have been welcoming and nice and returning my texts. I know these people from AA, 

Anyways, tonight I got asked to Matts and declined and told myself that I would make an attempt to go next Friday. I went out on the porch and a very old familiar thought came to mind. Maybe they want to jump me? I was then reminded of one of the reasons I don't socialize. It makes me think people want to fucking murder me. 

It all started about thirty years ago. I was doing a lot of drugs and was being paranoid a lot. Anyway's at 32 I was diagnosed. I think my being in a gang and almost getting jumped by my friends has played a part in this. 

I just thought I'd share my story so I could just get it out. None of my friends know this about me. They know I'm mentally ill but don't know about the people killing me thing. It's too embarrassing. Maybe sharing will help me deal. Thanks if you read this. I plan on going next week. It's just going to be a lot of fighting my thoughts until then.",07Dec2019,1

36,"I met this guy at a concert on my birthday. We had an instant connection and became friends.. once he made a move on me &amp; we had sex, I fell for him hard. Signs were there that he only wanted to keep things casual and non exclusive, but I kept hoping he’d end up liking me back &amp; that he felt what I felt.. I never had liked anyone as much as I had liked him. But he didn’t want a relationship, &amp; he felt things were moving too fast.. he broke things off with me when things got bad. 

I took a half year dry spell since him. Then I met someone new on vacation. We danced together and I hadn’t had that much fun with a guy in a long time.. I enjoyed his positive energy. He was kind to me, and I felt like we could talk about real shit. We had sex, and for the first time in a long time, I didn’t hurt so badly because of the one who broke my heart. He wasn’t as experienced in bed, but it wasn’t just the sex that I enjoyed. It was his company.

I went back home and felt bad about the guy who dumped me all over again. Knowing that we live in the same city and that he doesn’t want me in his life. Knowing that we’re so close but so far away. I still talk to the guy I met on vacation.. but it’s not like we can hang out anyways. I just want to get over the guy who dumped me, but idk how or when it will happen.",07Dec2019,1

44,"NSFW: Poop. I don't even know if I should be posting this.

I suffer from very bad depressive episodes that cause me to forget to eat, or I just don't get hungry. This goes for fluids as well. Just about an hour ago I got a very violent and scary reminder that I have barely drank any water in the 2-3 weeks. 

I have been having some constipation issues lately and I figured it was due to my diet becoming absolutely horrid due to my depression and stress. I wasn't worried about it because I would manage to get something out every week, but a while ago I noticed wet pencil thin poop. I knew what that meant, so I took some of my saline laxatives for good measure and forgot about it. After what just happened, I believe that was warning that I should not have ignored.

I have been struggling to poop for a week and have been unable to for 5 days. I didn't really have the urge to poop, but I felt a discomfort, so I headed to the toilet. To my delight, my bowls felt active and I had a good feeling I was finally able to pass some stool. Everything felt like it was going okay, until the poop wasn't coming out, along with my legs aching every time I strained. I then realized what was happening, as I just went through this same problem a year ago after neglecting to stay hydrated. The poop was too big to pass.

After inspection, my fear was confirmed. The stool was way too big, but it was already too late to abort the mission. Being hopeful, I tried to keep pushing, but it wasn't coming out... Not on it's own at least. I stopped pushing after I started to see stars in my vision. I was starting to panic. This thing was huge. I was fearing that I was going to tear myself down there, but I took the dive. I tried to assist it on it's journey of squeezing through the back door, but the back door couldn't open any wider. Okay, great, plan B. Do you know what you do if a piece of furniture won't fit through something? You disassemble it. So I disassembled it. I disassembled my poop... With my fingers...

During the several minutes of disassembly, I was hoping that I wasn't going to cause damage to myself down there. Once I was sure I was set, the pushing commenced. I'm pretty sure I know what it feels like to have a baby, but without the horrible pain. (I salute you my fellow women.) In between pushes I performed breathing exercises because I was going past out if I didn't. Thank our lord The Flying Spaghetti Monster because that goddamn rock come out and his company hurried out with him. So I sat there out of breath and reveling in the fact that the nightmare was over with fecal matter on my hands. I had to see what this shit looked like. I swear it was a 1"" 1/2 to 2"" in diameter and seeing it just made me feel worse.

Needless to say I had to sacrifice a roll of toilet paper so I could get into the shower. I sanitized everything around the toilet, popped some saline laxatives, and I am currently downing water. I am keeping an eye on my pain and future poops because that could not have been good for my #2. I don't hurt too much, just some discomfort, which is a good sign... I hope it's a good sign.

Stay hydrated boys.",07Dec2019,1
45,"I'm working during our company's Xmas party and don't feel particularly close to my colleagues so figured why ask for the day off just to attend the party?   So many colleagues are younger than me, are on social media, I'm not , and frankly I just care about doing my job, nothing more.   But I regret declining the party invitation because I know it's expected we attend, some see it as a way to show team spirit and here I am staying alone shying away.  I'm ashamed.

I never really get chosen I guess. I try to be a better person every day even by a bit. Sometimes it just doesn't seem good enough. I don't know. My level of self worth is pretty low. I know most of this is a sort of mental distortion. Just kind of hard to shake off. 

Anyone else who feels similar, I want you to do me a favor and keep doing better for yourself. I don't care what other people say about you. Doing self improvement no matter how small is just fine.

I tried to fit in, I got made fun of in a really gross way a lot. There’s this guy who is constantly trying to make jokes and not only is tp  exhausting the goal is to make people look weak.

I just gave up, how pathetic is a 30 year old jumping through hoops trying to get people to like them. Well now it’s a big thing that new people be fun and not downers, implication being I’m the downer. I tried, I got rejected and they blame me.

49,"I was just getting ready for bed thinking about it. Last year I used to allow people to treat me like absolute dirt. Use me for my house, my car, my adderall prescription, my body(ex’s included), my time, my energy. Of course I was being taken advantage of.. I knew this, but I’ve always wanted to belong somewhere. It blows my mind how much I used to let people treat so bad just to “fit in”. I tried so hard for these people. If they invited me somewhere last minute I was there, if they needed a place to crash I opened my doors, I was only invited to provide a ride once we got there I was invisible again.

I had 2 different groups of “friends” doing this to me. One I was more invisible in but the other I was the constant butt of their jokes. It wasn’t the inclusive friendly kind, it was the shady kind. They were just so mean. I tried but I never stood a chance with these people.

I don’t even know when I stopped bothering to come around them. I just stopped. Even though I feel bummed about being 20 something w no friends, I’m glad I’m away from those people. My spirit was so broken every time I came home. I’m still trying to find a solid group of friends. I honestly feel “traumatized” from how cold they were. I remember crying to a “friend” about a my ex scaring me during sex and I’m pretty sure he told people as a joke. Kinda tearing up now lol.

50,"Today I was having a great night. 
I went shopping, ate pizza with my roommate, finished some work I had been putting off, had a long convo with my mom and a friend who lives out of town that I miss. 

I made plans for tomorrow, had a good run on apex legends, then finished the night laying with my cat with a glass of tequila watching southpark. 


I went to bed and for some reason I decided to read my rate my professor page. A week ago I asked my smaller class for feedback and it was largely positive so maybe I was confident. Students have asked me fore what classes I’m teaching and said they would take me again. So I find my name (I’m new so I wasn’t sure if I would be up) and I see a single review. All negative feedback. 

I know it’s one review but anonymous feedback feels more .... real more honest and I hate to think I’ve been a bad teacher all semester. I know I shouldn’t take it personally just take it in stride and move on. But it’s just been bugging me.

51,"I'm 22 years old and I'm kind of drunk right now because a friend of mine became a doctor and yanked me out of my house to go get drinks.

I love to write. I've been told I'm good with words, better with sentences, and I believe half the people who say these things. I hope this is a throwaway.

It's finals week, I'm in grad school, I love the stress, I love the rush that comes with an overflowing plate with no room to breathe. It's an excellent life; I wouldn't change a thing.

I read a lot to keep up with my thirst for stuff. I remember things even while drunk and it's honestly a curse because I remember stuff from my last relationship which failed miserably and from parts of my life that I've buried under really weak veneers of miscommunications with myself, but I regret nothing, which is good, and I'm proud of myself, which is also vaguely okay-ish. It is a curse, knowing things. It is worse, remembering them. I'm in counseling, I rigorously meditate when possible, and I seek any form of physical affection that I can.

Maybe, in a strange and poignant way, I am at peace. I'm over a bunch of traumatic stuff that has plagued me my whole life. If that makes me a weak man, so be it. I love to write. Maybe I'll write that novel someday, when I stop pretending to be happier than I am. I look forward to nothing. I am a practising absurdist and a part-time stoic. I wear decent clothes and make friends on the fly. I've come a long way, and today evening made me realise that I am capable of being open with someone without holding back the worst parts of myself.

I'm 70% certain that I'll delete this post when I wake up in a few hours. I hope the other 30% wins. It's a good life. I don't claim that it's the best, but it doesn't have to be. Maybe nothing does. How awesome that would be, just a bunch of ambitious people aware of their limits, working towards a better future? Wait, isn't that NASA? Who knows. It is yet unsure if I am loved, but it is certain that I am at peace. The love thing will probably show up when I least expect it. Which is great. I'm gonna sleep now. Peace.",07Dec2019,1
52,"You ever watch diners drive in and dives? I hate that show so much. Not because it’s a bad show, but because that’s what was playing when I was holding my mother as her marriage fell apart. It’s a different kind of pain, watching the woman who gave birth to you, show that kind of sorrow.  Watching her go in and out of reality is a sick, strange, and suffocating experience. Doing my best to be as strong as possible for her, while trying to process what’s really happening is surreal. I always knew life wasn’t fair. Seeing it happen in tv shows, movies, books, and word of mouth, you can ALMOST feel their pain. But when it’s becomes a reality all that empathy doesn’t prepare you in the slightest. 
 Things will eventually fall apart. It’s just the reality of life.  No matter how strong your base, no matter how deep the bonds, one day! All will be lost and forgotten. But even with how bleak and sad it ends up. I still gotta wake up tomorrow and fight for what I love. Even if it ends in the worst possible scenario I refuse to give up on the people I love.

54,"The benefits of good nutrition and organic food has always been well known but now more than ever, the world is getting conscious of their diet as food borne diseases and aliments have increased exponentially.

Consumers are now opting for natural, organic, farm fresh fruits and vegetables and striking down animal meat as the main source of protein. Furthermore, according to a market research, the demand for organic spices and herbs globally has risen with the Asia-Pacific region dominating this market at a whopping 76% share in 2017, closely followed by North America.

This has given rise to a lexicon called “**Superfoods**”. These include herbs, botanicals, mushrooms and other such plant-based foods, all of which contribute to a superior diet, higher energy and overall better nutrition.

# Paradigm shift – Nutrition the Optimum Way

One such company actively involved in propagating the nutritional health benefits of plant-based herbs and botanicals is **The Golden Herbal Company** based in Canada. What really separates them from several other organic companies that lay claim to their nutritious output is the method by which The Golden Herbal Company sources these much sought after plant-based botanicals and herbs, thereafter using a proprietary technology to process them whereby the molecular complexities of the plants or herbs is maintained to give maximum nutritious value, **just as nature intended it to be.**  In fact, that is their Mantra as well.

**The Secret Sauce**

The company promotes nutrition and diet, based on the ancient Ayurveda teachings and practise with the addition of modern day research.

Careful consideration is undertaken as each botanical and plant-based herb is handpicked from the unspoilt highlands of Thailand, immediately processed within a few hours of harvesting and converted either to a powder form or packaged into capsules for easy consumption.

It is important to understand that all the herbs and plant-based botanicals are organically grown in the pristine mountains of Thailand, in their natural habitat, without use of any harmful chemicals/preservatives. In addition, a differentiator is the use of a proprietary technology which doesn’t use heat to process them. When heat is involved all the essential enzymes and nutrients of the herbs and botanicals get degraded with the traditional system of boiling or steam. Instead, due to their proprietary and innovative technology, the plant-based botanicals and herbs are better preserved, fresh and natural in their original form with the plant bioactivity retained even after being processed. Furthermore, the complex cellular structure is not compromised which gives potency and optimum benefit as a potential natural medicinal alternative. Hence consumers are provided with pure, organic, natural and potent products for long term sustainable good nutrition and healthy living.

**Natural Herbs that serve many needs**

Plant-based botanic and herbs have extraordinary benefits with little to no side effects. Benefits, such as improved eyesight, weight loss, as a culinary base or garnish, higher energy, as an anti-inflammatory agent, the list goes on. Therefore, **The Golden Herbal Company** has discretionally introduced a variety of plant-based botanicals and herbs with the focus of creating and educating consumers on better nutrition, living and lifestyle. Their website allows you to choose from a range of specially processed powders and capsules. These SUPERFOODS are available both for retail as well as bulk orders and can be obtained directly from the company’s website. All the products are FDA approved and GMP certified. Many of them are Halal and USDA certified. They are in the midst of introducing many plant-based formulas such as DETOX, PROTEIN and WEIGHT LOSS blends that will be encapsulated for easy consumption.

A WHO study in 2008 confirmed that nearly 80% of the world’s population depends primarily on naturally derived products to address some of their health needs in place of modern medicines which are much costlier and come with a series of side effects too.

Here are the some of the highlighted products of The Golden Herbal Company:

***Whole Turmeric Powder or Capsules:***  
Useful as an anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-depressant, brain function, cancer protection, cardiac health and anti-ageing.

***Black Ginger Powder or Capsules:***

**Useful in reducing** triglycerides, preventing diabetes and increasing the blood flow in the testis for male sexual performance thus increasing sperm density.

***Mangosteen Rind Powder or Capsules:***

Useful  for positive effects on cardiovascular health having anti-viral, anti-biotic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties.

***Sacha Inchi Seeds Powder or Capsules:***  
Useful for skin care, weight management, cardiac functions that improve blood circulation, lowers blood pressure, fights inflammation, lowers bad cholesterol (LDL) and raises good cholesterol (HDL). It is a plant-based protein source with rich content of Omega 3, 6, and 9 polyunsaturated fatty acids.

**Nourish the body and cherish the soul.**

As the world’s food consumers are revisiting ancient benefits to consuming plant-based food pyramids, their consumption habits and purchase trends are changing as well, thereby making room for more organic, pure and natural botanicals and herbs as their daily cuisine. What we put into our bodies is being considered far greater by the millennials than the boomers ever did. Conscious consumers are now extremely cognisant of the optimum balance between nutrition and exercise. This phenomenon has thus given rise to nutritionists and yoga proponents as a new career and lifestyle. Living in the digital age and educating oneselves on striking the right balance has never been easier. **The Golden Herbal Company’s** aim is to educate consumers on striking that right balance to nourish the body and soul without burning their pockets.",07Dec2019,1

71,"I love my grandparents very much, they have always been a HUGE part of my life and took care of me and my siblings as regularly as twice a week since both my parents worked full time, particularly when I was very young. They are very much “hippies,” my grandad not so much now - you can tell by some of his music tastes that he used to be one but otherwise you would never know - but my granny is very very spiritual and dresses “like a hippie.” As I got a little older I knew that my mum had a strange childhood (she was bounced between parents, step-parents and boarding schools as well as living in squats with my granny), and I wouldn’t say that anybody tried to hide anything from me. I saw pictures of my grandad with super long hair, and I knew that they spent most of their lives travelling (for example, my grandad spent time living in a kibbutz); this was something I admired about them actually, because they seemed to know so much and had stories to tell about absolutely everything. But a few years ago whilst on a family holiday in France, I was told by mum that my grandparents used to be followers of Bhagwan (I know that he goes by other names too but the one they all used was Bhagwan so that’s what I’ll call him). She said that part of her and one of her sister’s childhood was spent living on the commune, I believe it was somewhere in Ibiza or something like that, since this was before all the stuff happened in America and was the early days of his following. My mum told me this sort of nonchalantly and was laughing about it, as she does with most of the bizarre things she experienced growing up, so when we got back to where we were staying I asked them about it. They didn’t seem annoyed or anything but I got the vibe they weren’t exactly thrilled to be discussing it either, and they told me that they were given different names whilst there. Funnily enough, their long-time friends who I have always known about STILL go by the names Bhagwan gave them (I don’t really want to write them here because they’re so unique and I’m scared someone may see this post lol). I called up my auntie and she said that she really liked it actually, that as a child it was just fun to live in the sun with her parents not really caring, and that the only thing that bothered her was being told to call her parents by these other names. Anyway, I found this out a few years ago and since then the documentary Wild Wild Country has come out... I still haven’t seen it because I feel like I will find things out I maybe would just rather not know, even though I know that they left before things got criminal and too intense. I think it’s just a strange thought that they could have so easily been coerced into being involved in something so manipulative, and also undeniably there’s the fact that my poor mum grew up in lots of situations like this. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t view my grandparents any differently and haven’t spoken to them about it since, it’s just that whenever it pops into my head it gives me a strange feeling. Maybe I should just watch the documentary... maybe it will tell me that it wasn’t actually that bad in the beginning",07Dec2019,1
72,"Let's start off by explaining that Me and my partner are hungarian but her aunt and cousins are from Erdély which used to be part of Hungary but after wwi Romania got it so the whole infrastructure and mentality developed in a different direction. It remained more rural and catholicism is still very common and religiousness is very common basically as a whole.

 I am not following any religion and I'm a city boy from Hungary so we are really different. 

So this part of my girlfriend's family moved to the UK two years ago and my partner moved in with them last year. I couldn't go with her then but after a year I moved in with her separately in another flat in the same city.

We often meet her family and it's just so amazing how loving, nice and inclusive they are with me. They are so kind oh my god. 

My parents are very different. They are low key racist, openly homophobic and judgemental. And they are atheists so very different families that we have.

Also her family is so laid back and chill while my parents were always agressively controlling and so fucking overprotective it's crazy. 

Also in general I feel so great living with my partner in a foreign western country at the age of 20. This is basically a dream come true.

Also we couldn't make it to go home for the holidays and there was a big ruckus about it, my parents blaming my partner and all crazy shit like this...

The moment my tired head hit the pillow, I must’ve been out.

I'll make it short, I tried for more than a decade to improve myself, see what didn't work, why the ones I thought to be my friends would forget my existence the moment they didn't have to sit next to me in class anymore, why I couldn't wake any kind of interest in the other sex and  so forth and so on. I kept hoping and trying but it never went anywhere.

Once  I turned 30 I decided that if people couldn't care less about me, I would just avoid them as a whole. But loneliness still hurts at times and it's hard to get past dreaming about friends and romance. Admitedly it hurts way less than naïvely hoping to be something but never amounting to be anything, but still.

79,"I think I might be somewhere on the spectrum or something. Looking for advice of how to be more likable. 
Here’s the thing, I’m technically popular and well-known in my city, I have lots of “friends“ but not really. I’m never invited to things. No one wants to just hangout with me. No one texts me.

Here are the things about me that are possibly positive: I’m pretty, I’m self made and successful, I’m technically a good friend. If someone’s in jail or the hospital, depressed,  down on their luck. I’m the type of person that will show up and help out. 
I’m generous (I feel like this might be a bad thing sometimes though because I have more money than my friends) I’m honest. If I’m paying attention to you I’m a good listener. 
Things about me that I think might be part of the problem: I have more money than all of my friends. I live in the city I grew up in, I was an artist drug user type when I was younger and so that’s where my peer group came from, but I started my own business which was very successful and now I’m way more financially secure than pretty much anyone I know. I feel like this could be weird for people. I’ve given a lot of my friends jobs in an attempt to share the wealth without just giving handouts, but that’s probably messed up our relationship because now I’m their boss. I have a very real face blindness which comes across really poorly. Even if I know you and like you if you change your hair or style I might not recognize you and therefore I might not talk to you. I can be brutally honest, I often say something that just feels like the truth and see on peoples faces that it was hurtful. I can’t pay attention to more than one person at a time. People are definitely jealous of me, and that’s really hard to deal with.

My doctor said I can take pills but thet are expensive and she also warned me that they might not help. She also said that I should either drink more water or eat more salt. My palette is very simple so I never liked lots of salt although I loved chips and popcorn.

One winter I figured that eating a bowl of heavily salted popcorn  every second day is much easier than drinking two litres of water a day. So I resorted to eating loads of salt.

With summers becoming hotter my kidneys started to pain and whenever it happened I just quickly jugged a litre of water to prevent dehydration (this caught me twice in the first month and being on a drip takes a lit of time).

I always thought I would only live until 40 years old (23 now) but realised with our family's heart issues that I might not even make it to 40.

So I switched back to water and dropped the salty diet. I thought that avoiding a lot of salt for 21 days would break the habit and that having the detox will teach me to rather drink water than eat those rediculous amounts of salt.

It really changed me in ways I hate. I crave salt all the time. I have cramps all the time. I feel tired most of the time and my limbs sometimes just go numb. It's really hard to resist and after 10 days of no chips or popcorn I felt like eating a desk in the hope that there is salt in it.

Today sadly, I ate chips, lots of it. I am still proud that I could resist for ten days and that I am sticking to the water. I am proud that I want to take care of my health. I hope my heart can be ok again (it pains excessively when I jog) and that I can break this habbit. Hopefully I will get there.

People look at me like I’m a kid, I’m not very beefy body wise, I’m scrawny, and “short” (5’10”) and men tend to think they can “try” me often or get one over on me. I observe, people tend to treat guys who look more “grown” with more respect but if you’re barely over 130 lbs like me it’s terrible. I live at home again, and my folks still treat me like I’m some fucking child who has no say so in anything, just do it and shut the fuck up. 

I do not have the time nor money currently to focus everything on some diet to get beefier. I’ve to establish myself, economically. No time to worry about my appearance, but it just sucks. 

My former best friends girlfriend was outting everyone and she says that I’m so anorexic she could snap my twig arms in half. 

This has angered me, for too long. I feel like everyone sees me as weak, useless and a mat to walk on. My ex swears to god she loved me, didn’t use me and blah blah. Everything she did rebuttals that argument. I’m useless until I fit society’s standards of a man’s appearance. 

I forgot, I’m a “nigger” as well. Most of my friends are white. The ones who I’ve had a fallout with called me nigger which is expected. Said I’m “like the rest of them “. I’m a “weak minded bitch”. I guess because I used to let certain shit slide when I knew they were in the wrong, and they did too, but let whatever happened happen anyway. I remember hanging out with three of my friends (white) and they invited their mutual friends over to hangout. Once they visited me, they heard how I talk and shit that interests me and saw how I dressed and said “oh you’re one of those wanna be white guys?”. I looked at him with a confusing look. I said “no?” Then he said some black joke that everyone laughed at except for my main friend who was there. The other guy would keep bringing up black jokes and my race and shit every time I’d talk. Then I was like “I’m not white bro lol” and he’s all “then what are you”. My main friend immediately butts in and adds “He’s just u/GawtDayum. “ of course he didn’t say my user but you get it.

100,"I started a new job in a lab weighing samples. I've been working here for just over a month now with another new girl whose English is not her first language. We get on well and everyone is really nice except for one woman who is 60. She was okay at first but then she started taking the basic work and leaving us two newbs with complex assignments. Which was a bit bothersome at first as she didn't really guide us on how to do the work, but I enjoyed the challenge. Fast forward to two days ago. The computers had been down so no new work was coming through and as per usual she took all of it and claimed that it was her priority to have it as she isn't new. Okay fair enough, we found work within the lab to do.
Thursday samples started to come back through very slowly and the woman in charge of them asked me and the other new girl if we could sort them out for her so that she could get more work done. Great we where happy to help as we had no work to do. Some of the samples where big orders so we placed them in the oven for me and the new girl to do all afternoon as we stay an hour and a half longer than the nasty colleague. We knew we could get the work done in the time we had and there was enough equipment to do it in as the whole team had been unable to work all week. All fine and dandy asked the woman we where helping and she said that was fine. Whilst waiting for the work to be ready for us to complete somebody else asked the other new girl to test some samples however she would have to wait for a certificate to come before she could complete the work. So we started setting up for the afternoon work that we had organised to do as we had no other work. About half an hour passes and then the shit hit the fan.
The nasty Co worker went full force on shouting at me saying that we cannot pick and choose work, we are a team, we are adults and if anything goes wrong she will be the first to say that we have done it. She then states that we have dumped this testing work (the one that we had to wait for a certificate for) on her. I try and diffuse the situation, apologise and say if she tells me how to do it I will do it now for her. That's not good enough for her. She then drags this other new girl into it but as English isn't her first language she doesn't realise that she is being spoken to. Then nast Co worker erupts even more stating that she will not tolerate this kind of rudeness. Everyone has always got along here and she has worked here too long to take this kind of shit. She then goes and gets the supervisor and anyone else in her path and tells them how horrible we are.... We didn't get into any trouble and no body even spoke about it other than saying ""she is like that sometimes and just ignore her, no one ever knows what to believe when she says stuff"".
So to conclude... I kinda want to quit because I honestly cannot understand what we did wrong, and she shouldn't be allowed to treat us like this and us just have to accept it. She went on to just ignore us for the rest of Thursday and Friday, no matter how hard I tried to small talk with her. We work in a small room just with her so she's hard to avoid...we just ended up sitting in silence and letting her do whatever she wants. The only good that came out of it is now a supervisor is giving us our work to do each day now, but I doubt that will last long.

Genuinely were we in the wrong? I mean honestly I don't understand wtf happened other than we got work and she didn't go through it and take it before we got anything to do... She had her own work that she had chosen in the morning before our shift started so it's not as though we left her nothing to do. And the work we did pick was basic stuff that we couldn't screw up... I just am gob smacked. And tbh its made me question everything I do in the room now as I don't know when she will blow again... Or go running around dragging everyone into it. Can somebody give me some advice? Wth am I supposed to do now? Should I just pretend it didn't happen and keep trying to talk to her? I am so confused 😕",07Dec2019,1
101," I thought that it could have been the result of my mental exhaustion yesterday that was causing me to be exceptionally forthright and zealous, but after waking up I only feel more certain of myself and the difference in the paths that we've decided to take.

And I'm glad that its happening via text. In words. I can believe it more, because facts are not able to cloth themselves in the disguises of physical appearance. It's all there on the page in black and white. No illusions can be performed to divert the audience's attention. 

Which is why this really is the end. Our goals are irreconcilable because they're being guided by completely opposing truths, although it seemed at one point that they might be converging. 

Your belief that unskilled thoughtless graft in the service of a ravenous profit obsessed organism like Amazon, whose soul preoccupation is everlasting growth on a planet which can't ever get any bigger to accommodate this delusional mindset, left me stunned.

But then you let me know that Amazon's biggest distribution warehouse had recently met its targets. Apparently. That was the word on the street that someone heard through the grapevine. I mean, what am I supposed to say to that or even think??? It means nothing to me.

Presenting me news that this monolithic organisation whose appetite has now grown so large, classes of human beings are springing into existence keen to have only one purpose while they toil for a living: to keep feeding this systemic idea that giving rich people great deals and bargains at the expense of poor people they never see, don't have to know of or think about is just fine. Nah man. Fuck that! You've always been a bit ""Hey Guys! Let's not talk about that depressing topic right now yeah? This is supposed to be a dinner party"" - kind of person. But obviously you can't skirt around where you truly stand forever. No wonder you're afraid of expressing what you actually think online and have fears about how your friends will judge you. It's so upsetting. I'm so not like you at all. I can't live a life in that way.

To be happy to invest sizable chunks of your waking hours to a project like Jeff's is best undertaken by people who don't think, can't think, are incapable of reflection, and see their labouring task as destiny itself. You think you are using Amazon to get what you need in order to achieve the success you say you're destined for, but you don't realise what the true price is that you've paid for reducing yourself in such a crude and myopic way, which mocks the vision of what you can be if you strived continuously, instead of the momentary elations of epiphany you savour at your leisure within the grounds of comfort and security.  The more I want to be totally honest with you, the more I think I'm likely to cause you pain, which obviously isn't my intention here. It couldn't be intention here because the manner in which I'm trying to hurt you is far too floral and whimsical to ever go straight for the jugular.   Writing 'THE END' in finishing off my message yesterday, I admit was a bit dramatic and OTT. But whether it had been well-tempered or even quite muted, the message that it was conveying had a gravity that can't be ignored. Something has ended and I'm not sure what. And things that have ended are sometimes resurrected and given the opportunity for a sequel, which is more often than not very cheesy. But for now, I hope that you're right. I really hope you get to where you want to be and the manner in which you do this is something you feel sure of, because I have nothing more to offer or say.",07Dec2019,1
102,"I’m short, 5’4, and have always been chubby starting when I was a teenager. In college I weighed around 170 pounds. Some people totally rock being thick, but it didn’t work for me. Clothes never fit me comfortably, and I didn’t know a lot about how to feed myself or exercise. 

For the past three years I’ve lost weight in small bursts, usually by starving myself, and then gained a lot of it back when I got exhausted with the routine. 

This fall I finally decided to do it differently, and not worry so much about the results, just the lifestyle change. I have worked to put healthy food into my diet without obsessing about calorie counts, I let myself have pizza when I want to, and I have been going to the gym 5 days a week. I’m trying to embrace moderation instead of destroying my body!

Today I checked the scale and I’ve officially lost over 30 pounds since college! And I’m finally under the 140 pounds mark, a goal I was never able to achieve through starving myself.

104,"Okay, where do I start here? I've never written a post like this before. In fact, I've never talked to anyone about this topic except therapists and psychiatrists. I think I'm just curious to see how you people take this.

I am 30 years old and have been in psychiatry 8 times since 2012. I have spent a total of 2 years of my life in psychiatric treatment. Apart from that, I have spent hundreds of hours in outpatient therapy. I collected plenty of diagnoses: severe depression, ADHD, bipolar disorder, dissociative disorder, mixed personality disorder. I could never identify with any of them. I often had the impression that the doctors didn't know what to do with me. But in the ""real world"" I had massive social anxieties, severe underweight, sleep disorders and constantly suicidal thoughts. I didn't get along at all during my studies and had to go back to the hospital again and again. But there was always one issue that burdened me so much that I pushed it away again and again for years. And when I talked about it in therapy, it seemed so absurd that my therapists or I quickly wiped it aside: I thought I could be paedophile.

No, I didn't just think ""I could be"". Sometimes I was absolutely sure. Sometimes it felt like it was attached to me like a disgusting stench. Like a plague. I often couldn't think about anything else, especially when I was with people.

It's hard to say when this story begins. But when I was 12 years old, something happened, which I distinctly remember. I got too close to a girl in the schoolyard, I pretty much groped her during a game of tag, and she cried incredibly and hit me wildly. I didn't know what was happening to me. Later I was called out of class. A teacher gave me a lecture, but that was not necessary. I was absolutely horrified. I thought I had done something terrible to this girl, as if I had raped or killed her. I didn't go to school for two weeks and was terribly afraid to see this girl again. I was alone during the holidays afterwards. My parents were rarely at home, I had few friends. I felt absolutely terrible and didn't know how to get rid of that feeling. Then I did what I regret the most to this day. I had my first computer with internet access and via a file-sharing service (Limewire?), I started downloading everything terrible I could find, especially violent videos and pornography, including child pornography. It was a bit like looking into hell. But some of the girls in the videos were my age. That did arrouse me aswell. It was extremely confusing. But it somehow turned me numb. I felt neither fear nor joy. But I felt like nobody could harm me any more. I had turned myself into a monster.

Looking back, I had this tendency much earlier. When I was much smaller and had terrible fear in the dark, I told myself I was the worst of all demons. I talked to the other spirits and devils as if they were annoying tormentors. I told them to shut the fuck up and let me sleep. And it somehow worked.

The phase in which I watched these videos was fortunately not so long. I don't know where else I would be today. Probably I would have killed myself long ago. Even before the holidays were over I had caught a Trojan from one of the downloaded files, which made me panically deleted my hard disk and from then on stopped with this shit. 

But of course it stuck with me. When I was 18 years old I had my first girlfriend. In the first week in which we were together, everything was still quite beautiful. I was incredibly happy and in love. But as soon as we started having sex everything became terrible. I had a strong sex drive and wanted to sleep with her all the time, but paradoxically I couldn't enjoy it at all. It was as if I would not feel my body any more, as if I would step out of me. And I then had to think of these videos and I had to push them away. When my girlfriend asked me, ""What are you thinking about?"" because of course she realized something was wrong, I just couldn't tell her. That was absolutely terrible and from then on it just got worse and worse. We became more and more alienated.

Shortly before we broke up, I was with my girlfriend, when we visited the old building of my kindergarten. It was a kindergarten where many old family friends brought their children. People knew each other. I met former kindergardeners there, with whom I used to play in the sandbox. It should habe been quite nice. But when I was there, I could suddenly remember something. I could remember very precise fragments. I prefer not to go into detail. But it was very strange. I could remember exactly where I was in the room and how I moved after something happened.

Today I realize that I remembered someone raping me. But then I immediately thought: ""You're inventing it because you're a paedophile yourself."" I had never thought about it so concretely before. But from then on my life finally became hell. I had to think about it all the time. I started to become really uncomfortable around children. On the one hand this memory didn't let go of me, on the other hand I had to kill it with something that was even worse. A cycle of pure terror.

I've been waging this senseless war in my head for many years. What I was most afraid of was that other people would learn about these thoughts. I felt like if someone thought I was pedophile, it would finally become true. Does that make sense? And I thouht noone would ever believe, that something had happened to me. After all, I didnt believe it myself. For example, when friends stayed with me, I used to run a microphone while I slept to make sure I didn't talk while I was sleeping. And I kept repressing those thoughts, but they kept coming back. 

Until I started therapy, in my early twenties, I never had anyone to talk to about all this. I haven't talked to my parents about it and I don't know if I will ever do that. I feel like I don't know them and they don't know me. Thinking back to my childhood is incredibly alienating to me. I was alone all the time. I remember listening to the same cassette tapes with childrens story on repeat day and night, just so I wasn't alone with my own thoughts.

Once I started talking about it in therepy, the typical response was as follows: ""We don't know if you are paedophile. You have to answer that yourself."" But when I said: ""Yes, you're right. I'm not."" Then the thoughts came back again, and stronger. And when I ""accepted"", that I'm a pedophile, then it felt like a great relief. But it also made me feel strangely ridiculous and ultimately depressed: I can't remember ever having found a child sexually attractive, but I fell in love with girls or women of my age. So what's wrong with me? Why can't I let go of it? It was not until this year that I finally met a therapist who understood me right away. She simply told me straight up: You are not a paedophile. What you have are compulsive thoughts. My favourite line was ""Thinking I'm a cat doesn't make me a cat."" How ridiculous. Anyone can see wether you are a cat or not, but your sexual preferences? How can one truly know? Well she knew. And the more we talked about it the clearer it became to me, too. Shes a very warm and humourous person and for her, my thoughts weren't scary at all. 

But I forgot to tell you about something else, the reason why I got to meet this therapist: Last year I fell in love. I fell in love as never before in my life. At first we were best friends, but that quickly developed into more. In the beginning we were working together, on a creative project. We ended up seeing each other every second day. She just radiated warmth and really showed me, how much she liked me. She's an incredibly funny person and we were lauhing all the time. I'm not used to that at all. Usually I think people hate me, or find me discusting. I find it hard to trust even old friends, but with her it was different. We were together for a short time, but unfortunately it didn't work out. She got back together with her ex. It still hurts a lot. In fact it hurt so much, that I had to go back to the clinic, where I met this great therapist. But one thing had happened with her, that somehow changed everything: On a day when I was feeling very down, I told her about my memory from kindergarten. I was completely disbanded and kept saying: ""I don't know if this really happened"". And she just replied, ""Yes, it happened."", as if she had been there with me. And then she took me in her arms. Every time I think about it it makes me cry. I really miss her. She's the greatest person I've ever met. I can't explain why it was so important that she told me that. But somehow it makes sense and I think shes right.

Thank you for reading.

I just want to starve myself, at first it was a plan to 'reset' my diet by not eating for a week, but now it's morphed in a gross fantasy where people notice. 

Why do I want my teachers and peers to notice and worry for me? It feels gross even admitting I want this, but I do. I just feel disgusting. My body is disgusting. Everything I eat is disgusting. 

Does anyone have an explanation for this twisted idea? I hate it.",07Dec2019,1

108,"Actually, I am from a poor country. I studied civil engineering and received my admission for a master degree in a University of Canada, I have also obtain a scholarship for my scolarity. 

Some little backstory, After finish my study, I have been struggling for Job, And one time i receive a contract for 7 months from a civil engineering firm, But after that i have not been able to have another contract or other stable Job. I see that it’s difficult to find Job after the end of my contract, I decide to start a little business there, But it’s not legal yet, still in the informal sector. 

This year starts and i obtain my admission to the University to pursue master degree and i obtain it and also a scholarship. But for economic proof i havent the amount and i decide to made some close people that i know to give me their bank statement as documentation and they agree that they will help me for my living expenses. 

Two days ago i see my visa refused. For reason that i am not in a situation stable to prove i will return back in my country. While i tend to agree with their decisions cause it’s their rules, But it’s always come on my mind to say why this world is covered so much with inequality. 

I knew those concerns about financial status, But i am from a really poor family, I don’t have any assets on my name and can’t prove i have the amount that the immigration wants me to show them by myself. That really sucks to see your potential is burning because of poor background and i don’t want to be dishonest by showing false documents. 

I just have to continue fighting and hope that one day i will achieve my dreams.

18.35/hr might not sound like much to some but this is the first time in my life I've made this much and I'm ecstatic. Went from 23k to 38k a year. Now that's before taxes, *but*, we always get at least 4 hours of overtime a week. So that's an extra 6k a year.

112,"You would think that people who like people would be better people, but I have realized in my experience it has been almost always the opposite. When you think of someone who doesn't like people, you might think of some horrible criminal, and they probably don't like people, but I think for most people it's just that they're frustrated with people because they hold them to higher standards. Whereas people who like people tend to be more going with the flow and accepting of people even if they're giant assholes, because joining up with assholes can be a good time. So the more pernicious forms of evil are more encouraged and celebrated by people people.
