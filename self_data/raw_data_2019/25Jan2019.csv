0,"I decided this was the most fitting subbredit to post this in, if you don’t want to read so much, skip to the end.

I’m an Egyptian, American teenager whose lived half his life in the US then in Egypt then back to the US.

I hate to teach history, but when I was 9, I moved to Egypt 3 months before the Egyptian revolution. It caused mass hysteria and ruined not only the economy of Egypt, but the morality of the country itself.

I went to school at 4th grade after attending every previous school year in America and got continously harassed because of the xenophobic nature of the country. By the time I was in 5th grade, I was heavily bullied, depressed, and tired.

One fateful day, I was invited for a family reunion and I had one big ass family, 30 members exact. I was sitting alone in one of the rooms when one of my cousins, 30 year-old-lady, came in and jumped on me and clawed me L4D Hunter style.

I screamed and at the time, my older sister was the only family member who came and I watched in horror as my sister pummeled my cousin and my family members trying to break the fight. My cousin claims that I “sexually harassed” her, a 10 year old boy on a 30 year old woman.

Her family members started shouting death threats and even went to my school and tried to get me expelled. This broke my family and we’ve never been invited to another reunion and I was always looked down upon after that.

At 6th grade, my classmates started crossing the line and would pull down my pants, touch my penis, grab my ass, or try and grab my penis for a good 2 years. The school would never do anything about it because I didn’t have “proof” and the teachers weren’t keen to try and stop bullying at the time.

At this exact year, a new president came in office and the country fell into another revolution because the electricity would only be on for 4 hours a day and shut off for the rest for a good year. My sister was a teacher and couldn’t handle the lack of electricity so she moved overseas and I was only left with my mom and my absent father. At 11th grade I was devastated, my mother had gotten lung cancer, I was getting bullied by my own boss in my TA job, and I was in Highschool.

My mother was the only woman who raised me and had to deal with not only the constant harassment of my relatives because of that one issue many years ago, but my own dad used to constantly harass her and shout at her infront of me. Now, she was terminally ill and I had no one left.

I used to have a circle of American Egyptian friends who’ve now all left to their respective homes and now I was truly alone. I started having constant panic attacks and my sick mom would cry everytime she’d hear that something happened to me in school.

I felt guilty for my own issues because it was troubling my mom. I’d go to school and the girls would even harass me calling me a “Psycho” and telling me to just kill myself if I was so depressed. One day, I lashed out at one of the girls and I told her “stop acting classy because you’re just knockoff merchandise and an insult to a skank.” These were very popular girls and I had a pretty big hit on my head. The guys were eager to gain their approval and try and tell me “they’re just women” in front of them in a very formal manner.

I was really pissed off having people ask me why I was being mean to women and how to “act like a bad boy to be happy.” I wasn’t into the “Nice guys always finish last philosophy” and I really hated the idea that people would give me such ignorant advice rather than to just talk to me.

I figured they tried giving me advice to try and look respectable infront of the teachers and other students, so I straight up ignored everyone. At summer, I finally moved back to the U.S because I couldn’t take Egypt anymore and there was no way I’d attend university there. Unfortunately, me and my dad were brought together by this scenario.

I never really spoke much to my dad and I always viewed him as a coward for disrespecting my mom and always blaming her for my downfalls saying that “she never raised me right” when he never raised me in general.",25Jan2019,1
1,"I don't enjoy doing anything, I don't want to do anything, I don't want anything. Nothing is enjoyable and if everything just sucks while nothing is fun why live? I really just don't see any point anymore. 

I'm 23 now and I've felt like this for at least 5 years, and if I remember correctly I just stopped being happy around when I was 8 for no reason. I really don't know what to do.",25Jan2019,1
2,"So, basically I’m having a rough go at it at right now. In the last 5 weeks, a lot of my life just sorta crumbled away. Just for background, I had an extremely troubled childhood that culminated in multiple suicide attempts during high school.

My grandma died a few days before Christmas last month, and she was the closest thing I had to a maternal figure after my dad died. After he died, my mom sort of became unhinged. For example, she believed people were spying on her through the computer, so it stayed off for years while I did homework at the library. Then I would go home and just be alone until around 10pm. Which was for the best. She always came home either in a rage where she would immediately scold me basically because she just didn’t like looking at me and beat me if I made a squeak during her rants (as in, there was a time where she threw my head against the wall strong enough to make me bleed) or she would just have a weird kinda silence where she basically just sat down next to my sister and me and watched TV, and I couldn’t be sure what she was going to do.

But anyway, that’s just the context. I had to go back to my hometown for my grandma’s funeral a little while ago, and being there brought back a lot of really painful memories which have all been sort of been coming in waves. Some days I’m gone, sometimes I’m fine. It really just depends on how much I remember during any specific moment.

Then on new year’s eve, I had an internship that ended. For further context. I just graduated college but that was my first real industry job aside for student organization experience. I was hoping they would offer to extend my internship, since I worked alongside another intern that worked there for 3 years in college (and continues to work there). So I basically was told to leave on new year’s eve and that I could use them as a reference whenever I needed.

Almost immediately after that, my mom started threatening to kill herself over my sister moving out (I still live close to them). So I had to go over and talk her down, while trying to help my sister move.

Recently, she called my sister doing similar things that she would do with me. I intervened immediately and drove back to her home, because I wanted to talk her down and tell her it was inappropriate to do that I my sister. She ended up threatening to call the police on me, and I had to leave because she’d done that before. Then just a few days ago she demanded I give back the keys she gave me to her house, and essentially told me I was no longer welcome at the place she would decorate with words like ‘home.’

That was the day I was supposed to leave for a drive to Florida for a networking event/conference with a friend. I scheduled the trip as a way to try and find another job in an industry that’s almost entirely about who you know (I graduated with a journalism degree, but I am trying to pivot to marketing since I realized journalism isn’t for me).

While in Florida, I got absolutely shitfaced drunk just because with so much going on, why wouldn’t I? It might as well have been a vacation as well as a work-thing (part of the convention was a bar crawl and a friend from college ai went with agreed to take care of me beforehand).

Then, the next day, I was still a little drunk, but we went to the panels because I knew he wanted to go. Only I told him to leave me in the car while he went in so I could sleep it off. While sleeping it off, I considered suicide then and there, in a similar way to when I was in high school. Those events led me to being hospitalized (I’ve been seeing a therapist ever since, but there’s still a lot I don’t tell him). However in Florida, I decided it wasn’t my time yet and didn’t do it.

Now, I’m back home. I ate an edible a little while ago and while high, thought about the shit going  and considered killing myself like I had in Florida. It made me incredibly frightened, and I decided that I wanted to text a close friend and ask him to check up on me every week or so to make sure I didn’t try anything.

As a result of the shit with my parents growing up, I never had friends. Now that I have some, I’m terrified of losing them. Yet, I never told any of them of my flirtations with suicide, or the fact I was hospitalized and diagnosed with some mental illnesses (lol, you should be able to tell that by now, I guess) before meeting them.

I just don’t know if just asking someone to check up on me like that may push them away.

At the same time, this particular friend has called us best friends in the past. He said he’d do anything for me. But I’m worried this is a little much, since it’s tied into things I never told him about.

I’m worried about pushing him away, but could also use that kind of support right now, so I just don’t know what to do.

Sorry for the wall of text, obviously I have a lot to get off my chest at the moment. And, this was therapeutic.",25Jan2019,1
3,"It sucks just feeing like you just bounce from class to home to gym just existing and not feeling moved by anything.

4,"I naively believed that contracting the flu was so unlikely it didn't warrant the 45 minutes of my life to get. Then today I woke up with a really bad cough but other than that felt fine, so I went to work. I then developed a fever and couldn't concentrate on what I was doing at all, which is dangerous when working with heavy things as I do.

He hadn't gotten a job offer, he began to become more angry and finally he told me he needed a break to sort his life out. It's not the first time it happened to me. I was stupid. We all know what the break means. Now we're back in each other's company. I checked his phone. I checked his messages. And I'm destroyed. I'm crushed. The entire time he was talking to another girl. Liking her pictures and statuses. Taking pictures with her. Going out to bars with her. Meeting up for casual sex. They plotted against me. She knew of his infidelity and yet, she let it happen. I threw his phone, broke a few of his things and then ran out of his place. He's dead to me. But me? I'm dead to myself. My self-image, my self-worth. They're gone. How will I love again?

12,"For context, I don't drive. Usually my parents drive me to the train station and go from there.

So for whatever reason, my dad decided to drive me to the train station on Monday. Just as we left, Mom popped up and said she could've drove me, but Dad basically said that he would be ""right there"". As if it was no big deal.

About halfway there, Dad questioned if the train was actually open that day, and somehow that never crossed my mind that it wouldn't be. Turns out it wasn't. Dad let out a chuckle.

So it was up to me to navigate him to my work building. Well I'm bad at directions, so up goes Google Maps. This caused my dad to quip ""You don't know the surrounding city?"" or something like that.

The trip was mostly straight forward, though there's a part with a U-turn, which I tried to warn him about, and he just asked if he had to turn at a specific street. I just said yes.

Now, the building I work at is right next to a bank, so when it came into view, I pointed out that that was the spot to turn. After the turn was prepared...

Me: Okay, see that bank right there?
Dad: No, DoomTay, I'm driving! That's why you need to give specific instructions.

Then for whatever reason, he drive *behind* the bank. Okay, no biggy. We just had to pass through the ATM and turn right.

For some reason, I said to turn left.

The building WAS right there, so this isn't any map's fault, just my freaked out brain.

So Dad made the (wrong) turn and then loudly chewed me out. ""LEFT, DoomTay!? What the fuck am I doing!? Where's the road!?"" I meekly pointed out behind us.

What followed was a rant from him about how he and mom ""waste time and resources"" driving me to and from places. During which he passed the final turn toward my work place. Cue even more yelling.

Then he said that after work I was to Uber to his shop, as he was ""never driving here again"". He also said to memorize the surrounding streets so I could navigate ""without a fucking map"".

Never mind that Mom has told me at least twice that she's okay with driving me and that things only fell apart when we were almost there.

So I went inside, and as soon as I dropped off my bag and jacket, I headed to the bathroom, plopped on the floor and sobbed into the towel for five minutes or so.",25Jan2019,1

14,"Ever since my last relationship a couple years ago, I have had very bad luck when it comes to being interested in new people. It generally goes in one of two ways. The other person is uninterested, and I move on pretty quickly. Or, we hit it off, self doubt creeps into my head after one date. I always doubt that the other person is interested and break things off before they can go anywhere. I think this is because of some past damage and I’m afraid of getting hurt again.

I have no option but to go under due to the teeth being impacted, and I come from a very conservative family who will NOT just excuse what I say because of the surgery. They were furious at my cousin for saying something slightly obscure, and they both despise the LGBTQ community.

 
Is there any way I can prevent myself from losing control? I also have severe social anxiety so even on an every day basis I rarely show my personality in front of my family in fear of judgement, so I feel so anxious as to what I might do if I can't control myself. I had anesthesia once when I was getting 4 teeth removed before braces, and I was completely well behaved that time, just sleepy.

Back story: I have been an employee at the same company for 20 years. I am a single mom of two kids, one who who has mental disorder, and one who has cognitive disabilities. I own my own house and pay all my bills. I have been a very responsible person my whole life. 

Anyways, my company went on strike last November. We knew it was coming, and I was totally against the strike. I actually really dislike my union and think they act like a cult. From the start I said I would cross and be a “scab”.  Well, it turns out I really like walking the line. I walk only the hours my kids are in school, so I don’t need a babysitter, saving me money, and I only have to walk 24 hours a week and I get the weekends off. (It’s retail so that never happens). Strike pay is $400 a week, which combined with my child tax is enough to still pay my bills, but have no extras. I put in my ear buds, eat an edible and just have no worries or responsibilities for 5 hours. My dilemma is I feel guilty because I don’t support the strike, and my boss is probably wondering why I haven’t crossed when I said i would. Am I a hypocrite? 

TLDR: have selfish reasons for being on strike and not crossing the picket line when I don’t support the union.

When I was accepted, I was really nervous, since I'm the first non-Indian person to join in the team's history.

It really goes to show how we can all be inclusive and kind to one another regardless of what type of Asian we are!! I'm honestly so lucky to be able to live in the Bay Area. It's a super diverse place, and everyone is pretty accepting of different cultures and open to other traditions.

27,"So I need some advice from fellow nurses. I graduated in May 2018 and recently got a job at a psychiatric hospital. I chose not to go into the medical hospital setting for a few different reasons. First, I was unable to land a job in the hospitals because most of the them wanted experience and all the hospitals in my area are saturated with nurses! I also HATED med/surg clinical and the setting of the hospital in general. Psychiatric nursing was something I really enjoyed in nursing school. I got offered the job right on the spot and started about 2 1/2 months ago. Needless to say I HATE my job. I hate myself for hating my job because I am super grateful to even have a job that pays well and has good benefits. I am absolutely miserable to the point where I have been experiencing panic attacks almost everyday and have major anxiety, I'm not sleeping and hardly eating, I've been experiencing severe acne (which I've never had in my life), and I feel so sick before I go to work that I almost throw up. I cry everyday on the way to work and when I get home. The work environment at the hospital is not the best either. I've been bullied by about all the older nursing staff and gossiped about when I don't do something right. The hospital is also VERY understaffed and disorganized-so a lot of pressure is put on the nurses. I am also stuck in a med room for eight hours handing out meds to 15+ patients.  I know the first year of nursing can be hard but I don't see the point in staying in this job if I am going to be this miserable. I have learned valuable things from this job (like how to communicate with all different people and how to handle tough patient situations), but I don't see how this job is really going to help me in my future career as a nurse. I am at the end of my rope and just want to quit nursing all together. I almost feel like maybe I got in to the wrong field. My question is would it be to early to quit my job? Like I said, I've only been there for almost 3 months but I can't take it anymore. My health is declining and my mental health is especially bad. I have started applying to other jobs and actually have an interview tomorrow but I just don't know if I should quit or not. Any advice would be nice. Thanks:D

29,"The past 3 weeks have been the hardest of my life. The woman whom I thought I’d be with for the rest of my life ended up leaving me due to drama caused by a Reddit cyberstalker. In the end I gave it everything I could, I fought and clawed by way as close as I could, but again, the stalker caused more drama and pushed her way. We were together for two years and I shared honestly the best days of my life with her. To me dismay she told me she’d started seeing someone “seriously” a mere few days after we were still meant to be working things out. This really devastated me and tbh has inflicted the greatest pain of my life. I’m apparently blocked on everything and my number was blocked mid conversation. She told me to email her instead of venting to Reddit, but of course, no reply from her so I need to let things out.

I’m just now really able to eat, leave bed, leave the house etc. I’ve moved from the sad crying all day stage to the numb stage. I’m in acceptance. I really did do everything I could to salvage things and I really did love her with my full soul and heart, which is why I feel so lost. At this point it’s just the feeling of worthlessness and the fact that I feel not special at all, given that she could in two weeks get so serious with someone. But even that, is beginning to fade. 

I’ve just been beating myself up over the Reddit drama after she’s implied that it’s all my fault and that apparently I’m “sending people from reddit after her” even though I was being harassed before we even started dating by this guy. It just makes me feel shit because apparently she’s deleted all her social media because of it. I’ve been going over the same shit in my head and watching breakup videos for the past three weeks. Honestly I’m just tired of it. I’m not a bad person for coming online looking for advice on a relationship with someone I cared about. In the grand scheme of things, a boyfriend being that concerned about you to the point he wants advice on how he should proceed, shouldn’t be something to make you upset, it should make you happy. I can’t help that we were both victims of harassment but I refuse to blame myself anymore. 

Additionally Ive stopped binging relationship videos, as my therapist said it’s just torturing myself. He recognised what I have for her as being genuine love and as being my first real love. That’s why I’ve felt so lost and so bad. But there’s no point in stressing over someone who’s not bothered about contacting me, has blocked me, couldn’t be bothered if I were dead or injured or anything.

This guy in one of my classes made the effort to talk to me after class... and it was surprisingly really easy just talking to him. We’ve been talking a lot.

Alright let's start, when I was in medium school I had a best friend, we had known each other since childhood, and had gotten even closer during our first year in middle school it wasn't unusual for me to go over to their place and stay overnight, I felt like they were part of my family, I mean they gave me a family when I felt abandoned by my own. My best friends parents would treat me like part of their family and I was really grateful, and even though we hung out with the same group of friends, they were my closest friend, like my family, someone I loved so much I would've taken a bullet for. 

But in my second year of middle school, I got diagnosed with depressive anxiety disorder, and my life took a spin for the worse, I was going to the psychologist and all but things weren't looking up...and well one day when I was staying over at my best friends place, we slept in the same bed and I really didn't think anything of it, I really trusted them, by the time we were supposed to be sleeping, I heard my friend ask if I was still awake, it was like 2 am and I was tired so decided not to answer (my logic was that they were going to ask something or try to chat but I was way too sleepy for that), that's when it happened I heard it, they were masturbating right beside me, whispering to my ear stuff like: ""You're wonderful"" and such (I really don't remember must of them nor want to), I panicked and was really scared... and then I felt a hand on my ass, slowly touching my back and moving to my chest. I was really scared, I should've punched them or tell them to stop but my voice was gone, all I could do was close my eyes and hold back my tears.

This event repeated itself a weeks later, you may be asking yourself: Why didn't you say anything/ distanced yourself from them? I was doing just that, or well at least tried. I sent them a message when their family started to look for a house closer to mine (We lived a bit far away from each other) it was starting to get creepy, I mean before I would find it comforting to have someone who would send me a text every day, but after the thing happened I grew scared of them and didn't hang out as much nor responded immediately like in the past; still when I didn't answer they would keep sending texts until I answered or they would start calling me. My message was something between ""We should take some time apart from each other"" ""Let's try hanging out with other people for a bit"", I thought it would go well but it didn't, they threatened me with suicide if I were to leave them, they would end their life... I was young and my heart sunk when I thought about my friend dying.

Fast forward to my last year in middle school, we were in the same classroom (I had decided to forget about what happened those nights, I clung myself to the good times and decided to forgive them, my thought process was that I also had done some things wrong to them and hurt them, so what happened to me wasn't that bad...the worst thing I did was tell them to ""get over it"" when I felt like they were making a big deal out of something or tell them not touch me). It was the day before my birthday and I noticed that my friend was starting to ignore me sometimes, they also told me things about how I was so lazy and stupid because I would miss a day or two of school and fail because of that (I had to stay home several times during middle school, I was having a hard time and would cry for hours and wouldn't sleep, so when I woke up I didn't have any energy left for school) They would also hit me on the head or arms when they got angry at me (It wasn't a soft or friendly hit, no it actually hurt, when it was in my arms it would actually leave bruises)  I mean I felt like they were abandoning, hating me and couldn't process that correctly; my head started to hurt randomly whenever I went to school so I had pills in my backpack in case of a bad headache, the day before my birthday I was very anxious (I used to hate my birthday) so I took them all during recess.

What followed was... horrible to say the least, the school questioned me about it (had to lie my way out so I wouldn't get sent to the hospital) my friends were telling me how disappointed/ sad/ angry they were with my actions and my best friend was so angry, they yelled at me, told me how fed up they were with me and left. After a few hours, they sent me a message about no longer wanting to be friends with me...I couldn't even smile at my birthday party, my family had to convince me to go out and celebrate it, my father made the effort to tolerate my mother (they're divorced) but in the end, I was too sad and felt so heartbroken that even after being given presents and comforting words I would still cry over and over again. In my fit of anger, I told a few friends (who were also friends with my ""BFF"")  everything that had happened, including the night I decided to forget. After being ignored for weeks by my best friend and crying everywhere.  I opted to beg and cry for them give me a second chance; they gave me another chance (it somehow got worse than before) After about a week or two, someone told my best friend what I said...After having a class my best friend and another friend told me they wanted to speak with me during recess they cornered me and started questioning me, my feet were cold and my hands sweaty. ""Why did you lie to them? Ask anyone that has ever been over to my house I have never done something like that! Why the hell did you tell everyone about it ?"" ""Even if they did it why did you tell everyone? You are totally lying! Liar!""

Somehow I mustered up some courage and told my best friend thanks for the memories, sorry for telling people about it I shouldn't have done that, but that I was no liar, wasn't sorry for the truth and goodbye. After that, I turned around and ran back to my classroom in tears, a teacher saw me and tried helping me out, but it got even messier, I slumped to the floor and started hitting myself on the wall multiple times all that while crying, the teacher managed to get me downstairs and told me that maybe it would get better if we went outside and breathed the fresh air while walking... But they were outside and they hated me now, I lost my best friend because I always ruin everything, also I forgot to mention that both of my grandparents passed in the span of two months, and couldn't even go to their funerals because they lived in another state... Even though they were far away, we visited them a lot, every vacation or holiday, and I still feel like they aren't dead. My school experience was starting to get really bad after that, missing most days of the weekend, crying whenever I went to school, getting bullied and told ""Why haven't you killed yourself?', my grades decreased to the point where I was about to fail the entire school year, most of my friends ignored me with the excuse of it being our last year in middle school and wanting to spend their time with others who would change of school soon.

&amp;#x200B;

I just failed one subject, thanks to that I had to stay at my school (I had to present an exam in order to pass the subject), I lasted about 5 months in there before I became a mess again, missing school most days and spending those days doing nothing but reflexing about the past, I was still friends with the people who avoided me last year, I couldn't do it anymore, I gave up all hope and thought that my only choice was suicide (I had attempted it before) my thoughts were: I've gone through two psychologists, herbal medicine, it isn't going to get better, I'm done for, I failed everyone, but my mother thought otherwise I finally went to a neurologist and a psychiatrist, I'm getting medicated now, and thanks to my mother (who managed to convince my father) I'm transferring to another school, slowly with little steps I'm regaining my strength, my energy and will to live, I'm finally going to be able to say a proper goodbye to my grandparents, I left the friends who ignored me and met new people who treated me kindly, reconnected with true friends from the past, I was finally able to stand up to my abusive father (he's pretty agresive, yells at me and my sister and insults my mother while we are present) and overall I'm looking foward for the future to come... Look life is in master mode the whole time, sometimes it's going to beat you up badly and not give you a helping a hand, but keep fighting! You can change! And believe me, I know it's easy to say but really hard to do... But you can be happy, I'm sure of it, just keep it up! I want to get better and be positive about tomorrow, so I hope that everyone can keep fighting for their own happiness! Happiness is a strange thing... but I hope we can all learn to love tomorrow.

39,"A lot of people I know, when they go to fill up their cars with gas, try and get the dollar amount onto an even number. They're at $30.68, they pump the gas until they're at $31, it's just nice and satisfying to get directly on the $31.00. However, since in my car, the automatic shutoff doesn't work because of the way the gas tank is and I have to know how many gallons my car can hold, I don't look at the price, but the gallons. So if I'm very low on gas, I'll say ""Ok, I want to put in 13 gallons."" And so I do, however, every time, well, most of the time that I try and do this, I'm at 12.899 gallons (or something similar), and I'm tapping the handle little bits at a time, I get to 12.90 or so, tap one more time, and it goes to 13.012. Every goddamn time, there hasn't been a time where I've gotten 13 on the dot. But do you know what's funny? More often than not, the dollar amount, becomes an even dollar amount. $39.00, $37.00. I'm not trying to make this happen, I'm trying to do the opposite basically, and yet it happens anyway.

This leads me to think, to believe, that gas companies, when you're in the range of going over to the next dollar, that they make the price more than what it would normally be by saying you got more gas than you did, when you're *tip* *tapping* away at that handle, not much gas is coming out, but they increase the gallon number so that it's equal to the dollar amount to make it a whole number.

It's late, I'm a tired boy, but goddamn, this has been getting to me. And it may just be a stupid conspiracy theory, and no one else may have had the same experience as me. But I go to a trusted gasoline seller most of time, when I don't the seller is still a trusted one, just a different one. This problem still happens. I live in southern california as well if you were wondering.

Whenever i meet a new person be anyone I start trying to figure out what that person is thinking. I look for the absolute worst in people and their weaknesses which helps me in analysing their personality, moreover by this its easy to convince them to do anything and in very short amount of time say a week i know almost everything about their behaviour. 

The only problems is I don’t want my mind to work like this i want to see the good in people but how can i do this when i can clearly see their demerits.

And I’m not saying that it affects my ability to make friends rather it affects the kind of relationship i want to have with them. 

The see me as their alpha because for them what i say is correct for most of the time (which really is true tbh)and they listen to me every time i ask them to do and they are depending on me for the important things in their life because they know i can handle their problems but I also want someone on whoom i can depend my life.

53,"tl;dr I am halfway through my university course but I want to quit and do something else. Is it a good idea to talk about it with my dad or do I just continue without bringing up this issue? 

Hi, I'm a 21 year old university student. In highschool, everyone has to pick an elective subject, some choices are biology, engineering drawing, and accounting. I fancied none of those so, I picked the last option, IT. I didn't have any dreams while growing up. I just wanted to go through school and have it end. 

Having finished highschool however, I had to suddenly think of where to go for further studies. I was told to go where my passion lies, but the only things I enjoyed were gaming, anime, and music. I didn't want to upset my dad and said I want to continue doing IT. I'm the firstborn so, my dad is very eager for me to finish fast and get a job. I understand his concerns though.

We don't have a lot of money and the private university I'm studying in requires money. My dad refuses to get a student loan since he doesn't want any debts when I finish studying. It is expected that I finish foundation and degree within 5 years. I started 2016.

So, I am halfway through my course but I just realised that there is something else that I really want to do after 3 years of half-heartedness. IT and I didn't really click. I have trouble programming and can barely think of a solution to a question at all. I understand that I have to put in actual effort to learn this thing. There are books to read, guides I can watch, and lecturers I can talk to but I get stressed just thinking about code. I don't know if I could do this anymore and I think I'm just getting started. 

I know I'm probably just whining because it's too hard on me right now, but when I repeat subjects my dad will have to pay extra and it hurts me seeing him pay for something I couldn't do. I was able to make it here because of my groupmates and I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. 

I don't know whether I should tell my dad that I don't want this anymore or should I just suck it up and continue.

But nope, she rejected me, and after some while we still hang out the same exact way.
 That's my problem, I want to avoid her but I simply can't. I have other people to talk to, but i prefer to talk to her, make her laugh, I feel better when I am with her, but the fact that i know she doesn't see me the same way makes me sad, what can I do to stop thinking about her?

Getting some terminal disease, or being murdered through some random act of violence. I’ve honestly been thinking about getting a life insurance policy for my family to take advantage of if I were to die somehow.

I would never say anything about this to anyone I know out loud to anyone I know. I’ve had issues related to suicidal behavior in the past, as recently as about 6 months ago during a business trip out of state, and I don’t want to deal with anything like that again.

I know I probably do have some kind of mood disorder, because I know it’s not normal to feel the way I do on a daily basis, but I really don’t know how to go about getting the proper help and treatment and I don’t want anyone being overly intrusive and asking about this (my fiancée and mom have become quite close).

67,"This is going to be a very long and depressing post. You have been warned. Sorry for formatting, I’m on mobile.

I’m on a throwaway account, partly to keep myself anonymous, but I would also like to let you all know that if you want to give this post gild this post, please save your money. I don’t see why there would be anyone who would want to spend their money on my post, but if in the off chance you want to, please know that this account does not mean anything to me, aside from being a place to post my quiet thoughts. All I want is for people to hear my story.

Things have been bad for me lately. I’ve been dealing with worsening depression for a few years now, something that I’ve only now come to realize. It doesn’t take much to send me into a complete depressive state. I’ve had a pretty awful week, and last night I am certain that I would have committed suicide had it not been for an old friend of mine. Let’s call her “L.” For context, L used to be, and still is, one of my closest friends. We follow each other on social media and still talk, but we tend to only talk sporadically nowadays. It’s mostly because L and I haven’t seen each other in a couple years, and now go to two different colleges. L is one of the most outgoing people I know. She genuinely is so carefree and is the poster child for someone who goes to the beat of her own drum. I have extreme social anxiety, so that is a quality I’ve always been extremely envious of.
Cut to yesterday.
Things had already been slowly moving downhill all day and I could feel myself drifting into a depressive state. It’s was bad. Really bad. The worst I had ever been. I had begun the day with my classes, but after it was too much to deal with anything. I drive back to my apartment, I drew all the blinds, I turned out all the lights, and I sat in my bed, unmoving. I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t nap, I couldn’t move. All I could do was lay there and cry. Before things had gotten so far gone, while I had been in one of my classes, I had been browsing through my Snapchat, due in part because I had absolutely no motivation to work. After a little bit of scrolling. I came across L’s Snapchat story. I began to tap through it, until I came across a certain video. It was a video of my friend showing off a pair of goofy pants with a caption basically saying how she loved that pair of pants even if other people may have thought they were tacky or goofy. I don’t know what made me do it, but I left a message to her on that video. I told her how much I envied how she didn’t care what anybody thought about her. She doesn’t much go on social media, so the message just say there for a while, but I didn’t think much of it.

Then that awful night comes around. At this point I’m in full depressive state. I had been considering suicide by overdose for some time now, and last night something broke in me. I dumped out all the pills on my desk, and I just stared at them for what must have seemed like an eternity. I don’t know what prompted me to do this, but I decided to flip Snapchat one last time. Maybe a part of me didn’t want to actually go through with it all, or maybe I just wanted to have a symbolic, unspoken goodbye with my friends before I ended it all; I will never really know. I open snapchat to find one message. It’s from L. I decide to open it and she’s written me a message saying how her life had changed for the better now that she’s cut out her negative influences and how she’s stopped cari about what people might think of her. I guess I made i lighthearted joke and told her about how I sometimes seem to just bottle up my emotions. We ended up sending a couple messages back and forth. Something happened while we had been talking. I don’t know what it was, but somehow it made me not want to kill myself any more. I stayed awake throughout the entire night, just thinking and reflecting on my life. Around 5am this morning, I went online and arranged an appointment with a mental health professional at my University. I’m going in to see them today.

If you feel yourself experiencing a depressive state, or feel the need to commit self harm or suicide. Please reach out to others. Your pride will not falter because you need help. Your life will be better for it in the end. If you know someone like this, please do reach out to them. You have no idea what a single nice comment can do to someone.

To my friend L, I doubt you will ever see this post, or if you would even realize that this was you I was referring to, but if you come to find this— you saved my life. I don’t know what would have happened if you wouldn’t have been in my life. ",25Jan2019,1

71,"Hi ! For 6 months now i'm with a girl that i love more than anything else in this world, i've never been in love like this before and for nothing in the world i will do something that make me lose her.
But the problem is that sometimes i'm a jerk with her, i don't know why but she is so cool, so nice with me that i tell her bad things and make her sad for stupid reasons, and she receives what i say without reply to me and without saying a word (i think it's because she knows me and she's smarter than me), and i always apologies and feel so bad after that, and wandering why i told her things like this. To be clear, i've never physically hurt or touch her in a wrong way and i've never done things she don't wanted me to do (that's not that Kind of things i'm talking about, she's so precious to me) .. An exemple is when she want to join me and my friend in a bar at night, i'm very happy and i mean it but for some unbelievable reasons, my very first tought will be that she wants to drink beers (what is normal, she work really hard) or that we will see her ex or i don't know what, and it make me angry or sad for no reasons... But in reality, what she really want is to see me and to be with me. 
So it's a problem for me and realising that i have this problem don't make me change.. I'm sad and i really feel that she's too good for me. It's not as bad as it seems, we are happy together and there's no problem between us (appart this one) but i need to change that and don't know what to do, so i thought that explain my thing here will be a first step.

73,"I saw this quote on Instagram and people commented their opinions: 

     “If you stop talking to someone over and over, unfollowed each other and everything, but y’all always seem to find your way back to each other.. does that mean y’all are meant for each other? Or does it mean y’all should let it go and NEVER look back?”

What do you guys think? I broke up with the love of my life/soulmate/first love over something minor and it can be fixed. We aren’t talking to each other and we ended on bad terms. He was VERY in love with me and I wonder if he’ll come back. If he does, is it meant to be or is it stupid?

77,"Ladies, I (27/F) installed Tinder and I've been having some trouble using the app. The thing is I have vitiligo. It's in several areas of my body and is visible. I cover my face with make-up and occasionally my neck but that's it.

However, I've been having trouble swiping right on guys that I find interesting. My mind immediately goes to our first date and I wonder if they're really okay with my vitiligo, whether I need to say anything about it, etc. I know I seem insecure and I definitely am in this respect.

But I am otherwise a confident person and most days I don't give a shit about my skin. It's just that online dating seems so daunting to me. Any advice on how to deal with my situation?

86,"There is no meaning to life, at least that we are aware of. Anyone can make any meaning they would like to their life. It could be money, raising children, business success, etc. However humans are wired to want and need others. Before Christopher McCandles died, he lived totally alone in the woods and he learned from this experience. He said ""Happiness is only real when shared"", he learned how important human connection is. We are so aware now of the universe and of life and with falling faith in religions, and in governments and technology isolating everyone. Are most of us now not just united in being lost and not knowing why we are here. There are so many enjoyable things in life like going camping, playing with a dog etc but the only thing that really can understand you or make you feel more normal and understood I think are deep connections with people.

&amp;#x200B;

We will all die and none of our possessions will matter, we just own them temporarily before someone else does. Anti consumerism and minimalism is catching on and most people are aware of how owning more just means you are more tied down and unhappy. It feels to me like in the first world, we don't have community, we are so divided, no one talks anymore, everyone seems so alone, old people, young people, men, women, immigrants, disabled people. I know the concept of people being more important than stuff is already a widely accepted idea but taking it further is caring for others and deep connections really almost all that matters?

&amp;#x200B;

Is making connection and caring a good enough reason to live and your goals and meaning to your life? I have had very few friends and not the best social skills but I really just want to help others and I want to feel being open and trusting with another. I can't imagine yet being completely vulnerable and open with someone else and another person being the same way with me and neither person judging the other negatively but actual love and acceptance. Even when I talk to people and spend time with them, I feel alone and disconnected but I never make myself really open or talk about what scares us or emotions or anything much besides just having a fun time. What would be bad about this as life goals? Is being vulnerable and authentic and open to others a bad idea? Is being generous and giving to others dangerous or pointless? Is wanting connection over-hyped? Is a relationship where two or more people can be completely open and trusting with each other something that isn't really feasible?

A mutual friend of ours also started here and held a party during the orientation week. Earlier that day, my then crush met my boyfriend during an orientation  game. They were instantly friends and my then crush brought him to the party and introduced us. I met 10/15 new people at that party. I recall thinking he was cute but I wanted my then crush. 

Then crush became steady with another girl within the first month of college. I knew it was silly, but it hurt- she was his first ""proper"" girlfriend. In the meantime, I went to a few more parties with the people from my school and my boyfriend slowly caught my eye. I realised he was in one of my lectures with 250 people. He was quite shy, but I knew he was nice and funny from what I'd heard. 

Around mid-October, I got a bit tipsy at a party and worked up the courage to flirt with him. He was quite shy, didn't really flirt back much but still walked me home. I thought he didn't have any interest in me and felt quite embarrassed. I was wearing his jacket and forgot to give it to him. This resulted in me texting him to apologise and that I'd meet him after our lecture the next day. He texted me the next morning to see if I was ok etc. and about funny stuff that happened at the party. Fortunately, there was a free seat next to him in the lecture that day, so I sat down and gave him the jacket. He seemed way more relaxed and we joked a good bit. I started getting butterflies (which I've ONLY felt for the other guy before). He asked me to be his girlfriend in just 3 weeks and I've never felt this way before.

I know it's ridiculous, but the dream felt SO freaking real. I cringe when I think of that feeling of the air conditioning on my bare tush. I blush when I imagine looking down at my bare body. And the looks on the laughing faces of everyone in the crowd (especially Courtney in Finance ugh).

I confessed to my friend Ashley (who always calls me a ""know it all"") who laughed and said ""Well thanks now I'll never see you again without mentally stripping you down to your adorable tube socks. This is the funniest dream I've ever heard.""

1. Does anyone know why she finds this dream so hilarious? 

2. Why tube socks when I wouldn't even have that on for the presentation?? I mean I was made fun of for my ridiculous tube socks in high school when changing for gym? Why only a tie?

3. And why does it bother me so much if it's so impossible to happen???",25Jan2019,1
104,"I think i’m a nice person, or atleast so i’m told. Introverted for sure.  But as close as I get to a person, I ask myself “Do they love me as much as my cat does?” The answer is always no. 
Why let people in when they’ll just hurt me? My cat won’t hurt me. ",25Jan2019,1
105,"I don’t really recall the first and only time I watched Adam Sandler’s ‘The Wedding Singer’, but I know I was quite young. The thing is, I still don’t understand how I got the ending of this film SO wrong. 
Up until a few years ago, I thought that the ending of this film was so horrible and sad, and I didn’t really know why, because it was an Adam Sandler movie..

The way I remember it was that Julie (who I remember as a reporter for a big television company, not a waitress) had a psychotic boyfriend/fiancée (I remember he had blonde hair also) that was very jealous of Adam Sandler’s character and Julie, and at the end of the film decided to strap a bomb to his chest and hide in a bathroom (in somewhere like an airport or a casino idk). Sandler found him in the bathroom and tried to talk sense into him before the boyfriend revealed the bomb to him. 

The boyfriend then ran out into a large open space filled with people with his shirt off and the bomb displayed. Everyone panicked and moved away from him, but there was a circle of onlookers. Julie was there, waiting for Adam I think, and the boyfriend and Julie conversed (Julie was panicked and the boyfriend was crying to her saying he was going to blow himself up if she didn’t take him back). 

Sandler’s character had left the bathroom and started running towards the boyfriend, who Julie had managed to calm down a little bit, but when he saw Sandler running towards him his expression changed to sadness and he looked almost apologetic, before pressing the button just as Sandler’s character reached him, setting off the bomb. Only the boyfriend and Sandler were killed.

It then cuts to the future, where Julie is reporting on the previous scene. She doesn’t seem sad at all, but happy instead. She acts professional and even jokes about the situation, as if she didn’t know them personally at all. 

Anyway, that’s as much as I can remember, and I was wondering if there were any movies with a similar ending that I may have mixed up with The Wedding Singer?? ",25Jan2019,1

107,"I feel like this is a stroke.... I mean that’s what the mri said but my head has been hurting since 4am just like last time.... the weakness in my arm... numbness in my face

I was hoping what they saw on the scans was just the blood clot from my stroke 2 weeks ago. I doubt they’ll get my hospital records today.... 

I don’t have a whole lot of hope in me these days... my job interview is being rescheduled a SECOND time bc of this stroke crap and I probably can’t even make this next one bc I’m being admitted to the hospital and may be here on Monday and I can’t say how I’ll feel on Tuesday...

I had a first date set up for Sunday lol that’s out now and I’m not sure how to explain canceling bc I’m definitely not trying to be like “hey let’s reschedule idk for when though bc this stroke business is unpredictable. I’ll have my ppl call your ppl!”

Man for all the crap I’m dealing with right now I just think I should have done cocaine bc my health is betraying me in a bad way and for what? I don’t even drink and I kicked my love for Oreos to the curb before this ordeal began so this is just all sorts of wrong",25Jan2019,1
