5,"We split two months ago, and really haven't talked since. The split wasn't messy but wasn't super clean either. 

A few weeks ago I un added her on snap because I thought it would help me move on and show her I'm done. Turns out she can still view my stories even tho she's not my friend on snap.

I can of course change a setting so she cant see my story. But part of my misses the possibility of her reaching out to me. She could always find alternative ways to communicate with me if she really wanted to. But she doesn't, were 100% completely done and finished well never be in contact ever again. 

Even tho I still kinda have feelings for her, they're not as strong as they use to be. I've slept with one other girl since we split and just started school so I have more options. 

But I miss her even just on my Snapchat friends list. 

If I re add her back she will get a notification saying I added her back which is even more awkward. 

The obvious choice is to not add her back. But I still want too.",04Sep2019,3
6,"So, I came to a conclusion recently that changed pretty much my whole way of thinking.

The truth is that for a very long time I *needed* the validation and approval of men. I have always had a pretty low self esteem and I think it had to do with my less than spectacular childhood.

 My mother always based her negative opinions about herself based on whether or not she was conventionally attractive (she worked in a very appearance based career) and it sort of rubbed off on me. Also, my father is a very critical kind of guy so anything I made for him he always had to point out the defects or would have to be reminded to say something nice. Plus, he wasn't always there growing up (not because he didn't want to be) and my mother could be kind of absent sometimes, leaving my older sister and grandmother to take care of me/my younger brother. I was also the weird kid that never had a lot of friends partly because we moved around so much and also because I never really found my herd. 

So, that sort of culminated into me thinking for a long time that my worth was based on my appearance and especially how many men found me attractive. Then, it snowballed into self-loathing because even then it wasn't really good enough because I wasn't even that pretty or smart to begin with. 

As a result, I drowned myself in relationships with subpar men because they would give me attention or make me feel better about my insecurities. They would tell me that actually they found my nose attractive or that my belly wasn't actually disgusting (my mother would tell me to suck in my stomach at all times). I let them treat me as the side chick, the plaything, the object, etc. I had sex with a guy I didn't even like and didn't actually want to have it with because I didn't want to be rude (with no regard to what I actually wanted) and because he was nice to me for more than a second.

Then, my last ""boyfriend"", if you could even call him that, ""jokingly"" called me a slut and play-slapped me in the face. He had subtly started to chip away at my already low self esteem and self confidence. I was being so worn down that I was scared even to touch him just in case he wasn't in a good mood or that he would withhold more affection from me. So, when he broke up with me a few weeks afterwards, I cried for a day and got on Tinder. I felt happy that maybe I wasn't worthless or retarded (he called me that) and that I was worthy of a guy's attention. I went on a few terrible dates and then, after trying to find out what was really wrong; I came to this conclusion.

**I don't need a boyfriend, I need help.**

I need to reflect on myself, to work on all aspects of myself before I can even THINK about having a relationship again. Not only because I have been neglecting my mental health for an extremely long time but because I deserve better than to be treated like that. I need to find what I am truly passionate about, I need to create barriers and boundaries, and to repair the broken pieces of myself.

I don't just want to be put back together again, I want to be built back up 10x stronger.",04Sep2019,3
7,"Hey guys, I’m feeling super happy and proud about myself for being able to change how I was two years ago. I’m 15 at the moment, and the past two years have been a struggle for me. Seventh and eighth grade, I started feeling random surges of sadness which eventually took over. I was a very insecure kid and I wasn’t happy with myself, which lead me to gaining weight, 145 pounds to 170. As young as I was, depressive thoughts started entering my head. Ninth grade year comes around, and I turned into a huge mess. Failing grades, pushing my friends away and spending most of my time alone, as well as being toxic and grumpy. I then started getting folliculitis as well as very bad acne and I was balding in one spot. It was the lowest point of my life.

Summer then comes rolling around, and I had nothing much to do. I wanted to try out VR, so i had bought one and started playing games that involved cardio. My weight started dropping because I was actually exercising, and that motivated me to play some more. Eventually, I got more cardio games and I started counting my calorie intake as well as eating less snacks and better food since I didn’t wanna lose my progress, which boosted my weight-loss wants. Now that I was losing weight, I was motivated to be more active and started doing boxing and started playing basketball with friends, and so this boosted my mood. I went from 168 to 150.8lbs this summer. A kid that was once all about sadness has been reversed, I am now a kid who is very active and social around others. My focus on school has increased, aiming to become the scholar I once was in school. The body positive changes I had made over the summer also increased my mind positivity. I am now planning on getting a gym membership to fulfill my fitness wants more.

Granted, I am not where I want to be, but the changes I have made on myself to be a better person has given me a new outlook on life. Everyday I strive to be a better person. Of course, I have some off days, but those days are not as common as the past.",04Sep2019,1
8," I'm not in the shower, I'm smoking outside in my socks...

This was the first place that jumped to mind when I thought of this but I want to create a group that could get behind people working in jobs that are filled just for the paycheck...

I've been told too many times that my ideas are garbage and are not going to happen because, ""I said so."" The reasoning is ""This person who has clout in this working environment doesn't want this to happen"", so the manager vetos it on the spot, regardless of the amount of productivity improvement.

If we could get the great intellectuals of our society to put work into improving day-to-day tasks of workers, in any industry, and just piledrive the management of corporations into seeing the benfefit of change, we could go a long way into improving most peoples lives.

When a working class person has a suggestion of how to improve the productivity in a workplace, it is often dismissed as ""We could hire anyone to fill your spot, and then we don't have to deal with this 'insubordination' anymore"" ...so lets do that.

The main problem is that the people actually working these jobs have the best insight into what goes on in the trenches. Management has no clue as long as money is coming in at an acceptable rate.

So, instead of asking the ultra-wealthy to donate to their favorite tax break, we should be asking them to donate their time and personnel into building a better working environment to everyone.

10,"I am not sure this is the right place for this. If it isn't please redirect me. 

The first time it happened I was about to fall asleep. I am not sure if this is unusual, but it normally doesn't happen to me. I had my eyes closed and I wasn't thinking about anything. Suddenly, I pictured this scene in my mind. It was like a hallucination but in my head. My point of view was from a fan blade in a room with a girl laying down on her stomach. It was very detailed. I can still picture her purple shoes and green shirt. She was doing something, like writing. What I was seeing was moving like a camera attached to a fan blade. I saw that this room led to a kitchen with white tiles and yellow walls. I only saw this for a few seconds. It was extremely detailed and it felt nothing like a dream. I can never remember my dreams in such great detail and I wasn't fully asleep yet. I could still hear and I was aware of my surroundings. It was like I was seeing from another point of view.

Another time was when I took a break from studying. I was listening to music with my eyes closed and saw another scene. This time it was an above perspective with someone who had no eyelid. 
It happened again when I was about to fall asleep. I saw a door and my view was slowly moving in closer. I could hear distant piano music playing. That is the only time I have heard something while it has happened. 
Again, I wasn't thinking of anything and it was extremely detailed. 
Whenever I try to imagine something, it's different than this. It is like small scenes only for me that I see inside my brain. It has happened a few more times and they only last a few seconds.
I am thinking it might have to do with how relaxed I was? I am not sure. 

What is this? Why is this happening?",04Sep2019,1
11,"I'm 23, male. Was bullied into suicidal depression throughout high school because I'm kinda skinny, have a weak chin, and my ears stick out. I think I'm one of the lucky ones (and this is not a defense of bullying AT ALL) because I do feel like it left me a bit stronger. Eventually after all that pain I just got to the point of saying ""Fuck it, if they're gonna bully me no matter what I do, I'll do whatever I want"". That was a big turning point in my life.

Now, from 16 to now I've had 3 chances of developing a romantic or at least sexual relationship. I would bump the number to maybe 4-5 but I don't want to include unclear signals and personal bias. So I'm sticking with 3 people who showed very, very, very clear signs of wanting to pursue a physical relationship. The thing that prevented me from moving any of those forward was thinking that I needed to prove myself constantly. Ever get the feeling that someone's into you, and enjoy that so much you simply don't want to move the relationship forward and get to the next step? So you just keep getting the person to laugh and to smile and to keep giving you hints, and that makes you feel so confident that you don't want it to stop? Because if you move on to the next step and get intimate then things will move beyond jokes and fun and randomness into something more serious, you lose that confidence boost.

That's all these 3 girls were. Confidence boosters. I used them to feel better and that's it. I'm remembering going to a bar with a friend when I was 20. A cute girl we've only met once was there. I started talking to her. Amazing conversation for 3 hours. My friend eventually left to meet up with other friends at another bar because he was completely locked out. Then when I felt she was really into the conversation, I told her I had to go. She followed me outside and ran after me telling me she had texted one of my friends at the other bar and she told her they would stay a while so I could stay a bit more and take her home. That was my confidence boost. Told her no. Went to meet to meet my friends.

And this idea of having to prove myself is still going strong. And it sucks. Add to this the desperation and neediness that comes from being 23 and a virgin. And I'm still not looking for a relationship or for someone I really want to spend my time with. I'm still just looking for boosts. For example, there was a girl in my college class. Extremely extroverted, extremely energetic, loves to party, has a very random sense of humor, likes to make jokes constantly, doesn't like serious/deep/challenging conversations. Completely opposite of me. I'm way more quiet, don't like loud places or dancing, like to make a few jokes every once in a while, but I really enjoy conversations that get me thinking and imagining things (damn I didn't want this to sound like /r/humblebrag. I'm not judging anyone here), discussing dreams and projects, etc.

Did I decide to keep getting along with her as a classmate but keep some distance? NO. I started spending all my time with her. I went full /r/niceguys on her, texting her stuff like ""I really like spending time with you"" WHICH WAS A COMPLETE LIE, I was bored out of my mind hanging out with her, I didn't enjoy her random humor. I just wanted her to complement me and say she liked spending time with me, even though I didn't like to spend time with her. Eventually shit hit the fan hard and we stopped talking to each other after I became extremely jealous of another guy who was exactly like her and she seemed to like more than me (looking back... d'uh).

I wish... I wish I was free. Free of the need to prove myself, to get back at the bullies, to stop thinking I need to have a girlfriend or be in a sexual relationship to prove a point. I wish I could be with a girl and not feel deep down the need to prove that I could have her if I wanted to, and then get depressed when I get rejected or become obsessed at the slightest sign she likes to spend time with me. I feel like this takes a hit on my confidence. It also makes me very judgmental. I look at that girl and that guy thinking ""Uhh they are so immature. They can't have deep interesting conversations, and they are always making jokes, they are so dumb and immature gee"". But I can recognize that comes from a deep fear that I won't find someone if I'm not as much of a random jokester, and that I have something to prove. I feel like if I didn't feel like I had to prove I'm worthy, I would look at them and think ""Oh cool. They are not my kind of people. That's fine"".

I have vibrantly dyed hair, piercings, and tattoos. My boyfriend.... none of that, infact, it's probably forbidden by his father...who I hope I don't meet. 

Now, my boyfriend's mom has met me and she adores me, she does know we're dating and so does his oldest brother. But..that's it. My boyfriend doesn't want his dad knowing about me. 

It's, different being someone's first girlfriend, the first kiss, basically I'm hoping to be the first everything for him. Sex is something... we haven't talked much about, my boyfriend is abstinent and we have that boundary set up, no sex until marriage.

Usually dating someone sex is important, it's a chunk of why people even start dating in the first place, with the promise of one day you'll see this person naked and, do the do with them. 

I used to worry so much about sex, all the things that could go wrong, like STD or unwanted pregnancies.

 It's really nice to only have to focus on getting to know my boyfriend and just having fun playing games with him, talking to him and of course being able to be emotionally vulnerable with him, trusting him, and forming such a bond with him.

19,"Hi, everyone. A little over a month ago, I posted on the subreddit about changing my mindset. Some people asked that I update, so here it is. 

I've been struggling with changing my mindset; of course, this isn't something that'll happen immediately. Actively changing the way I think has been so difficult. I was doing great for a few days and began to have similar thoughts. I tried to fight them, but I stopped because it became tough. Giving up on things and being inconsistent is something I'm trying to stop.  

I'm trying to be better and pay more attention to how I think, I've realized that I put way too much pressure on myself and, consequently, on other people. I judge myself too harshly, show very little self compassion, and really struggle with accepting mistakes. I came to these conclusions because I paid more attention to how I think, so I guess that's a good thing. 

It's exhausting assuming the worst will happen, so I will make more of an active effort to stop doing it as much. Another realization I've had is that I have to go to therapy more often because being so panicky and depressed is debilitating. 

I will try again.",04Sep2019,0

I quit my career because it was toxic, but it was something I'd been striving for since I was in 5th grade. Now, I manage a fast food joint that I worked at since I was a freshman in college. I love the job, but it's a job. Not a career.

It took six long years to finish my undergrad. It took working threw jobs, taking less classes and dropping a few when lifengot to be too much. I worked at my dream job for two years and worked my ass off bringing great content. It wasn't until they offered me a raise but cut my hours (I'd be making less at that point) that I decided to quit. It was hard to let go of that dream in a dying industry. 

They offered my job back, though I was managing this other place. They offered it back at a low point and I decided to counter offer higher. They accepted but I just couldn't bring myself to work there again. 

Quitting my dream felt like a defeat. And I feel like I've been losing myself.

Being stuck within four walls for so long definitely affected me in adverse ways, although I'm finding it difficult to figure out if my insecurity is grounded in just that or not. When I go to work and then come home, I feel content and proud of myself for getting through the day. However, I don't have any friends in my city and social media actually worsens my anxiety. I therefore find myself extremely depressed on my days off, and to be honest, any time I introspectively think about anything. I find myself looking forward to going back to work, because the only thing I feel OK doing with my time otherwise is spending it and all the dollars I earn on my partner and our future. 

There are loads of things that I used to react to, that I am now numb to. There are so many things I used to enjoy doing by myself but I think a lot of the time I was just fucked up on something or the other and got a perverse kick out of writing my own dark narrative. I haven't laughed properly without performing it in a long time. I am working all the hours I possibly can, to provide for my family; to build the future I'm supposed to build. I don't feel like it would be fair on my partner to have my emotions take precedent over the greater good. The greater good is my life being about work so that I can provide for those I love. It's something I am proud to do, every single time I am able to provide something, I feel like I am fulfilling some kind of purpose. I guess I wish it made things better for me when I'm on my own.

You are a mess,  while your friend is organized,  knows exactly what she wants,  had multiple experiences,  is emotionally intelligent,  figured out her personal taste and style. 

You are constantly seeking validation from others, from her. 

Her tongue is not your first language,  so you talk like her, you even laugh like her, you use her words, because you truly admire her,  you want to be more like her. 

When you are not with her,  and someone makes you laugh,  hearing yourself laugh like her makes you disgusted with yourself. 

When shopping for clothes or gadgets,  you constantly catch yourself choosing the pieces she may like and approve of,  the colors she wears.  You catch yourself even searching for 'similar'  stuff she owns.  

Heck,  when scrolling throught Facebook or instagram,  you are instantly interested in something you otherwise might have disregarded only because she reacted to it.

I walk on eggshells every day because in the back of my mind I’m too aware of the fact that myself or someone I love could die right now. But how do I get rid of that thought, or how do I not be affected by it?? 

How do I follow my dreams and ambitions and actually grow and do things that are ballsy without falling apart or running to hide as soon as it gets hard. I want to do it, and I know somewhere inside me I can, but I just feel like I need a mentor or someone to walk me through the process of getting what I want. I’m not exaggerating when I say I have no idea what I’m doing and no real adults to help me, so I blindly try to figure out things that other people do to be successful. I thought I could teach myself and I wasn’t worried about it, but now I realize that I’m really struggling. 

I just want to feel like my life has a purpose. Part of my brain keeps saying “hey, maybe you were meant to get married and not have a real career or 9-5 type job. Maybe you’re just gonna be a homemaker type. Or maybe you’re meant to be an artist type or business owner and real work isn’t for you.

Enough is enough, something has got to change and I think it’s got to start with me and my mind set. I’ve done a little research into books on self love but I have no idea where to start, the options seem never ending. Has anyone else tried a book and can you recommend anything specific? If it wasn’t a book, what else did you try and how did it help you?

I just want some practical, no-nonsense advice to help me try to be a bit kinder to myself. I feel like I’m ready to be the next version of me and I want to take better care of this one.

54,"Hi. I'd like some outside opinions on my situation, as I'm getting quite frustrated with myself. 

I'm in my early 20s and for the last 5/6 years, my relation with my family is going downhill.  I don't live with them (due to university), but I visit almost every weekend. I really love them and they love me back, I'm sure.  However, I can't be my real me when I'm with them. I can't give my opinions, I can't ask them questions nor interact in any positive way. All I can do is answer yes/no questions and sometimes a few more words. I can't ask my mum how was her day at work, even if I really want to know. Why? I don't know. It's like something in my brain is blocking me from saying things. 

Worst part is that they don't know how to handle this (neither do I), and they can't help me overcoming it. Almost every day I hear a ""He doesn't talk"" from my father, so that puts me in a more uncomfortable position. 

I've always been the quiet guy in my group of friends, but I don't have this problem with them. I can have interesting discussions with my friends, I can talk about anything with strangers and I can develop strong relations with new people I get to know. But it's completely different with my family. 

I really love my family, they are great parents and I'm really proud of the education I got from them. They work their asses off for me to be able to go to the university. In return, I'm finishing my 5 year course with good results because I feel like that is the only way I can be a decent son.

I'm a 21M with depression and self-image issues. I am overweight and I have been balding since 18. I am trying to work with what I got right now, such as dieting and exercise, and also buzz cutting my hair. I would also grow a beard, but it's pretty patchy and gross looking right now so not yet. Anyway, this has helped me with my confidence. Of course I still have days of horrible self loathing where I think I am just horribly ugly, but more and more, I am able to look at myself in the mirror and be pleased with what I see. 

I have posted on r/amiugly, and yeah, a lot of people thought I was ugly. I didn't argue with them, but a part of me feels like I just shouldn't listen to them. Is it not more important that I like the way I look?

It seems like the general consensus that it is bad to tell ugly people that they are attractive because it will lead to self delusion and that telling people they are ugly will help them. Ugly people should acknowledge that they are ugly and gain confidence in other areas. What this tells me is that reddit thinks I am deluded for thinking of myself as attractive. Firstly, how am I supposed to be confident and also think I am ugly? I, and most people want to feel good in their own skin. Also, the information I received didn't really seem to help me at all. It just seemed to hurt my self confidence even more. It got so bad that I nearly started an eating disorder. Luckily I snapped out of it soon. 

How could people telling me I'm ugly help me? What would I gain out of it? Would tell me who I should go after romantically? Are people forbidden from going after people more attractive than them?

I'm kinda getting off track, but my point is that a part of me thinks I should be happy with how I look and ignore what other people think, but its frustrated when so many people on this site seem to disagree and criticize the idea of ""deluded"" self love. 

Idk, considering subreddits like r/amiugly seem to think I am ugly, am I being deluded for just ignoring what they say and continuing to think I look fine?",04Sep2019,16
60," 

Hi. I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I just want to tell the world (aka Reddit) how much I love my parents (don't worry, I tell them regularly, too). I am 22 years old btw. This is a really long post (sorry!) but I hope that the ones who do read it can take something, anything from it for themselves. I just got great news that I passed my exams and I owe this to my parents, so I thought I'd post a little tribute. 

My parents didn't always have it easy, and even today they sadly still don't. My mother found her mum dead in the kitchen when she was 13 years old. Her father was so heartbroken that he replaced his wife with another woman not even 6 months later. The new woman (to me she's my grandma because I obviously never met my real grandma) dated him for his money as well. When she tells people about how they met she never fails to mention how she was sooo impressed with my grandpa showing up in a Mercedes Benz.

My grandma was really jealous of my mum and her brother. My grandma also brought 4 kids into the relationship and she would always make sure her kids are better off than my grandfather's kids. She eventually made my grandfater choose between her or my mother. My grandfather chose his girlfriend/wife. He told my mum ""you know, one day you're going to leave anyways."" This sent my mother into what I believe (she doesn't like talking about it) was a long time of partying, sleeping around and just not getting life under control. She missed her mum so much and on top of that she got basically kicked out even though she did nothing wrong. She then got pregnant at 18 from a guy who beat her and left her before my (half-)brother was even born. She met another man and they got my (half-)sister at 20 years old. She and her husband divorced at 26 and she met my dad. I was born when my mum was 34 and my dad was 36.

My dad grew up with my grandparents, they both fled during the Second World War and met in the town they fled to. My grandfather built up a small company that built tools for larger companies. He made my father drop out and work in the company as well, even though that wasn't what he wanted. But my grandfather can be a real dick so he wouldn't accept a no and my father didn't dare to leave. He fell in love with my mum and they tried for 2 years to have another kid (me) because he really wanted a child (edit: so did my mum).

My father eventually took over my grandfather's company and ran it for a few years until the financial crisis in 2008 made us go bankrupt. My grandfather and father did some legal stuff wrong as well, leaving our personal money liable for the debt of the company. My parents are still paying off some of the stuff from 10 years ago.

We moved to another country in 2010 to avoid some of the debt and because my sister had already done that and my mum missed her and the new country seemed like a great idea. Also wages are higher in the country we now live in. I was 13 at the time.

My brother, who is 16 years older than I am, has never been in my life. He turned to drugs and alcohol in his late teens and never let go. My mum didn't tell him who his real father was until he was 16 because she thought that it would be better for him. He never forgave her for lying to him, but I mean what was she supposed to do? She was so hurt herself and to explain to your child that his physically and mentally abusive father is gone because he didn't want a kid is a burden you don't want to put on your child. He told me that when he found out about his father he legitimately wanted to kill her. But instead he became a drug addict and he hasn't talked to my mother in about 7 years. He has a wife, a step-son and a daughter of his own but honestly he's the worst father ever. He only cares about alcohol, cocaine and video games. He is 38 years old but behaves like a pre-teen. I hate him for hurting my mother for basically most of her life. In his eyes my mother is the only one to blame for his addictions and general problems. Lol, yeah, sure.

Even though all of these bad things happened, my mother stuck it out, and so did my father. Of course they have their own flaws, everyone does. But my mum has been feeling responsible for anything bad that's happened to her in the past 56 years even though a lot of it was just people using her and abusing her kind-hearted soul. My mother would literally do anything for me and the people she loves. She's supporting me through all of my debt and every other problem I have. I try not to load too much onto her and my dad because I want them to be able to stop worrying for a while, at least about their child.

My mother has been sick for a long time. It started with ""normal"" back problems but it turned into a real problem after a few years. Then she had a new surgeon who was supposed to be one of the best ones for the job. He did 3 surgeries on her and they all made it worse. I fricking hate this guy so much. My mum will never work again, and that's on him. She also doesn't get any money from the state because he wrote a report that she's going to be able to work again in 4-5 weeks. That was 2.5 years ago. This is of course not great in my parents' financial situation either because they could really use some extra cash.

Ever since I was around 10 years old we haven't had much. We live very basic lives at home and our greatest source of joy are our dogs. None of us could live without them I think. I don't think we've ever NOT had at least one dog since I've been born. But I actually think it's not that bad that we are kind of poor. I learned to appreciate small things and my parents have taught me so much. They taught me that even though money is tight you can enjoy your life by sharing it with your loved ones. As important as money is, it's only paper and you can be happy with no money at all, even though of course you have more worries.

I just appreciate my parents so much. They have gone through so many tough times but they always put me first. They made sure I get the best education I can. They have always given me so much freedom to do what I want. To discover the world on my own, to deal with life. But they where always here when I needed them. They kept an eye on how I was doing and as long as school was okay and I was being a decent person they basically let me do most stuff that I wanted to. I love that about them. I can tell that my other friends, who grew up more protected, struggle a bit more with adulthood.

When I go home (I live in the city that I go to university in) it always FEELS like going home, even though they've moved houses twice since I left home. It's a place for me to escape, a place to celebrate the good days and to forget the bad ones. I am so glad I have their full support. They always taught me that I can come home with any kind of bad news and they will always love me. And it's so true. I can feel it is.

There is no greater feeling in the world than my mom being proud of me when I achieve something and her forgetting all her sorrows for a moment. I love this because I know she can be miserable. I guess what I am trying to say is that if you want to be a parent all you have to do is be supportive. Let them make their own decisions, but offer advice. My father told me he will never tell me what to do for a living, or what school to go to (obviously because his father did that to him). But he can make suggestions and he can give me advice on my own ideas. And he did. And I'm doing great in uni. My parents are to me exactly what parents are supposed to be. They are my roots that I can always go back to to gain new energy for life. They are my rock that will make my problems seem much smaller by just telling me it'll be fine and that everyone is going through these things, but also by actively helping solve these problems. I am 22 and I have never loved my parents more. My love for them grows day by day. They taught me to be a kind-hearted person and not wish any bad upon anyone. That everyone can frick up and that everyone has a history that made them who they are. My parents gave me the wings, but let me figure out on my own how to use them, watching closely so I wouldn't hurt myself.

Mum, Dad, I love you so much and I have no idea where I'd be without you. I can't thank you enough for all you did for me. You deserve every good thing in the world and I'll try to give you back as much as I can.",04Sep2019,1

64,"I started to point out small things I liked about myself, like my collar bones or the tint of my skin. A realization came over me, that my body was the only true thing I own in my life, so why should I ever treat it poorly? I felt my arms, my chest, my sides, and I look down and notice one of my scars on my stomach. 

I’m 22. From ages 14-16, I was a self harmer. Halfway into being 14, I couldn’t remember what the purpose of life felt like. It all felt so empty. Really dark. It was absolutely terrifying. I didn’t know what was wrong with me. The only way I could stop my sobbing fits and panic attacks was to physically force my body and my brain to think about something else. And sadly, cutting really worked. I had successfully hidden it from my parents for almost a year, before my parents found out and I was off to therapy. But by that point, I had already racked up scars on my ankles, thighs, stomach, arms, and wrists. I didn’t really think about them being forever.

It’s been 6 years since I last did that and I honestly haven’t thought about that part of me in a long time. I ran my fingers along those scars and thought about the amount of anguish I had to have been in to do that. You have to be in a whole other world of demons to rip yourself open on purpose. My heart pounded in front of the mirror and I looked up and I was sobbing, seeing the reflection of the scars on my wrist while tears dripped down my face. 

You never think about this moment. You never think that you’ll feel it again and think about it again and experience it again. It’s so much different seeing it now. I’m an adult now. An adult wearing the same body from my past. My heart is broken. I want to love myself, all of myself, which means I need to learn to love my scars. But loving that part of my past seems like something that isn’t possible. I don’t know.

Yesterday I went out with a friend. Saw some of his friends at a park. They were loud, chatting, laughing, doing what a teenager suposed to do. We hung out with them a while. They started to collect money around, some lended 20, some 5. Two of the guys went to the store and came back with tehir back packs full of bottles. I had no intentions of drinking that night but they insisted. They were even more pushy once I said that I've never drank before. So I just took a sip of wine. It tasted like mix of grape juice and cologne. I drank a cup of it, tried to ignore the taste

My friend and I shared a bottle of beer. They said it was one of the expensive ones but it tasted like shit anyways. I was convinced that all of that would be enough to mame me drunk. I was scared that I wouldn't be able to go back to home at one point. My head was hurting, my legs were dizzy, my skin was on fire. They told me that it was all psychological and I would be fine in a few minutes.

It took more than few minutes but I was fine at the end. They offered me perfume and mints so that I wouldn't stink and my parents wouldn't notice. I took a shower when I came back home. Now that I can think healthy, is that it? This is what people drink when they're happy, sad, anxious, bored? It doesn't even taste good.

67," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

68,"...though I really shouldn’t be taking credit for anything. I think I got lucky, or else I had a lot of help. I’m can’t even remember exactly how it happened.

Nothing can happen until I’m pure, until the poison oozes out of my system. I think I’ll make my obligations though.

I’m thinking about her and what she said last night. I will cherish those words forever. I will cherish her forever. I read her 25 quotes on her Facebook from ten years ago, when she was only 18. They were so cute and affected, and it reminded me of how I was at that age.

I was staying with my auntie and uncle at their caravan, it was bed time so we got sent to bed and we decided to all lay next to each other whilst we slept, me and my two cousins. My female cousin slept in the middle of me and my male cousin, she was probably 8/9 at the time.

I woke up at about 3am and started watching porn as any normal 13 year old lad would do.
I was extremely horny and I decided to put my hand on the outside of her pants and feel abit. (She was asleep obviously). I was masturbating whilst doing it and this led me to put my hand down her actual pants. 

I’m now 22, I’m TERRIFIED of her remembering it and bringing it back up and me being labelled a pedophile, which I’m not.

It wasn’t about her being young, it was just a female laying next to me and me being extremely horny teenager. I’m sorry.  These skeletons are staying in the closet for now.",04Sep2019,0

79,"Hi guys! I am a 22(M) and this year was a roller coaster ride and I made my hardest decision of my life. It will be long so please bear with me.

Firstly, my parents divorced when I was 8, my childhood was ok, but I was bullied and humiliated sometimes. I never was good at anything, average in school, sports were not my thing, never had a stable relationship,. I partied a lot in high school(Alcohol, tobacco, drugs).  I don't have many hobbies apart literature, cinema, music, football (soccer) and improving my general knowledge. I am pretty shy and introverted especially in large groups, behaved like the 5th wheel. I am also lazy as f\*\*\*, king of procrastinators. I think I was depressed for most of my life, but didn't know. I think I missed a lot of what people my age do. I am negative by nature.

I graduated high school when I was 19 (normal age in my country) and I decided to pursue my dream of becoming a hotelier. I was always interested by this industry because I like making people happy, deliver good services to others and perform well when high stakes are involved. So, I moved to France where my father lives, but I study in an other city.

I currently am in my last year of bachelor in International Hospitality Management. I gathered 1 year of experience through internships in different départements. I succeeded my first 2 years. But I didn't fit in in my class, at all. I tried so hard but maybe it was about my looks, my personality, I don't know. I auto invited myself to parties, it was rare that someone proposed to me to go out. I am introverted and shy among groups. I developed an addiction to weed, from 1 joint every 4 days to 10 joints a day.

Then the 3rd year started. My  depression kicked me harder than ever as a lot of small negative stuff happened along the way (my keys slipped into the sewer, my bike was stolen etc etc). I lost weight (59 kg for 1,87 m) My  business plan for a final project was going nowhere. It was a mess. I was a mess. All my peers graduated and have a nice future ahead of them.

Turning point. On February 18 2019 (7 months sober yay) I smoked my last joint which resulted in a bad trip and I wanted to kill myself. I told my father everything (drugs, depression, failure), as you can guess, he was extremely disappointed . I took 2 weeks off at uni and decided to stay at his place. **I couldn't live like this anymore.** I returned to school for my midterms, I didn't study and failed most of the subjects\*\*. I decided to leave school this year (3 months away of getting my bachelor)\*\* We went to a psychiatrist, and after listening to me, he sent me to a psych ward where I spent one month there heavy medicated . After I left, I went to therapy, it helped.

Since May I live at my fathers which I am very grateful, he saved my life. I eat more (75kg now), work out from time to time, reduced my medicine, I feel better, study for an english exam, and I read a lot now. I still have trouble concentrating. Starting November I will start my 3rd year again I will not live alone anymore, but with 2 friends. The good news is that the school offered to pay my tuition for this year because I was a hardworking, very good student to their eyes., which motivated me   even more to succed. I hope getting my driver license next year.

TL DR: Depressed guy who was a drug addict, went to psych ward, sober for 7 months, restarting my 3rd year, getting my life back on track.",04Sep2019,1
80,"Medium-long post. I might delete later.

I've been dealing with a lot of pushback at work. It began five weeks ago when a few people at work started making snarky, tongue-in-cheek comments about my demeanor. I was confused and I simply couldn't wrap my head around why this was happening so I discussed this with my boss told me it could all be this problematic employee's doing. 

I've had minor disagreements with a problematic employee, he's someone who requires a lot of correction. (He is also quite non-committal to the ways of the publishing industry and it impacts the overall output of the team.) Turns out, my boss was the canary in the coal mine. This employee has been badmouthing me for the past few months. He does ""theatrics"" is what a coworker who knows me well at work have told me. Anyway, this reached a point where the people he would hang out with felt they should stand up for him. 

I've been snubbed on multiple occasions, interns are being told to avoid me, comments are being passed on my appearance, and the food I like, according to one employee, is something they feed their dog. I brushed it off thinking they're having a bad day, or lack social awareness, etc. The point is - I didn't let anything affect me and this was until I learned that he's been badmouthing me. 

I cried at work twice at the beginning of August, and once this morning. I kept telling myself I would be back on my feet in a few days. It's September now. This reaction is very unexpected of me. I'm the person who is continually relied upon for damage control of work. 

I'm also a highly, highly motivated person. I was a college dropout when I got this job - in five years I went from being an intern to the editor who runs all the magazines (except the finance - sales part). I work hard as I see myself as an industry leader in twenty years. I feel so juvenile for reacting so badly to the situation. And all of this is so humiliating to admit. 

I can't solve my mental blocks yet. I've lost the can-do attitude and the will to work. I've been holding myself together all day at work for the past few days. I can't walk straight when I visit that part of the office - I feel so conscious, so insignificant and alone. I get panic attacks at random times during the day. Sometimes I burst into tears at work - a few minutes ago, I just got off a difficult conversation highlighting the drop in quality of my work.

I'm glad that everyone around me has been super helpful - my family and my boss. I feel so foolish for not being able to get back on my feet. This is quite humiliating.",04Sep2019,0

83,"So last year was my last year of high school.

As a very short version of what happened, I got very ""depressed"" (actually just sad) the second half of the year, so my capability to pay attention in class and to study at home went downhill.

My class grades didn't go as bad, because our small class would steal a few exams from our teachers, and cheat during tests.

But then final exams come. I did the two main exams pretty well, but in one of them there was a confusing question that was worth half the mark. I thought I did it well, but I did the exact opposite (and I'm not the only one that did). I claimed the exam was poorly done, but they ignored me.

Then I had a math exam that I could use to pump up my final grades quite a bit. But I was to ""depressed"" and couldn't study one bit. So I fucked up that exam.

After all that it turns out now I can't get in the college degree I wanted, and I'll have to go to a nearby city where I know absolutely no one, and I'm very socially anxious.


I have calculated everything, and had I had a 5/10 on that math exam, or had the other exam been actually decently done, I would have been accepted in my city's college.

And now I have the opportunity to repeat that exam tomorrow morning (it's currently 17:55 here), but I haven't studied one bit, as I can't get to it. The more I think about everything, the angrier I get with myself.",04Sep2019,1

87,"There’s one of two outcomes for us as a civilization in the scope of the next few centuries.

A) We spend a very minimal amount of Earth’s GDP &amp; resources to deploy various groups to begin building on the Martian surface. They will build infrastructure, and greenhouse gas effects to solidify an atmosphere on the red planet. This outcome will result in a prolonging &amp; advancement of the human race. We can start from anew, using renewable energy sources, have no atomic or nuclear weaponry, and potentially have one stable, and well formed governmental strategy to govern the new Martian society. To rid our newly founded home of many of the corruptions and cracks we see in today’s world, we can establish a system of free health care, among other vitality and material possession in return for work on the planet, at least in the early stages. This will guarantee human life for at least as long as the sun remains in its current stage.


B) A common counter to this argument is the necessity to fix our own home, Earth. While this would be, ideally, the best option as we don’t have to invest any kind of risk into starting anew, there are many problems with this position. Here on Earth, we have hundreds of years of innovation invested. While this is a good thing for us, it’s had a highly negative impact on our planet as we know it, and the effects are being seen today more than ever. Hundreds of thousands of tons of *plastic* cover the surface, and our oceans. Many industrial chemical compounds leak out and contaminate sources of water, animals near them, plants, etc. The accessibility of nuclear weaponry makes it all too easy to detonate a catastrophic event, which can lead way to nuclear warfare, and nuclear winter. Regardless of your political position, there’s no denying the fact that our planet is warming up - be it natural, or an all-time-high carbon emissions rate - in the next half century, effects of that will be even more prevalent, and costal cities are subject to more damaging flooding, tsunamis, and more. 


In 1960, we had just over a population of 3 billion. 40 years later, that number doubled, and a mere 20 years later (today), we’re nearing 8 billion. Projections by 2050 claim, and accurately so, we’ll be at the 10 billion mark, despite slowing birth rates. According to the Australian Academy of Sciences, most experts predict that the most our planet can realistically sustain is 8 billion - a number we’ll likely achieve in the year 2020, just next year. Although others claim we’re already overpopulated.


Regardless of where you stand, your educational background, or biological ethnicity and gender, there’s without a doubt a mass extinction underway, and an overwhelmingly large amount of experts in various fields predict that we’re *currently undergoing* the 6th mass extinction for our planet. My position is, although it would be *ideal* for us to come together as a collective, and combat many of problems we’re facing today, it is *highly unlikely*, seeing as people simply don’t care, don’t know what to do, ignorance, or a combination of all three. It is all too easy to get caught up in the cycle of daily life, but these are questions that we must face the reality of. 


We need to put our pants on, and face the fact that the only way we’re going to expand human consciousness into the cosmos for many thousands of years to come, we must take the first and measurable step to *put humankind on the Martian planet*


This is not to say we should stop what we’re doing and freak out. You don’t need to revolt at your job, you don’t need to break shop windows and shoplift, or panic. But we need to conform as one, and look up towards the sky as our ancestors have for thousands of years prior to us.

95,"I believe that the only thing that makes the word nigga racist are the people making a deal about other ethnicities saying it. If everyone is allowed to say anything that’s just one step closer to everyone being equal, where I’m from anyone who uses that word uses it as a replacement for dude, it has no racial meaning in that context but there are people out there that would say it’s racist even if it’s said to a white person by a white person. Now, that doesn’t mean I walk around in public using it left and right. I’m aware that some people are overly sensitive to it and I don’t feel like getting my face bashed in by a group of black guys. But if I’m playing COD and I get killed by a person prone behind a jeep, I’m gonna make the call out “there’s a nigga behind Jeep” and I bet you money it wasn’t based off of his skin color cause I probably didn’t see it while he shot me. 

I just think that true equality will never happen unless something even as simple as words are normalized to be said by both races. Let freedom of speech be taken by the government instead of taking it from each other.

103,"Life is what you make of it. Never has a truer sentiment been spoken. Life is what each individual chooses life to be, whether voluntarily or involuntarily. Because in its essence life is a derivative of a finite amount of core principles. Most of what we do and are is composed of characteristics derived from two fundamental values. The drive to reproduce and our sense of self preservation. Most of the mental health issues we face today is from one of these two, often the latter. Meaning in its core, most of the issues and areas we give weight to today are essentially fabricated. Love for instance is nothing but a byproduct of both of the values (the former mainly.) 

What this means is that almost everything in life that we truly value is mostly a societal construct based on derivatives of the two fundamental values that are biologically bestowed upon us. This might seem like a very pessimistic and negative outlook on our beings, but the opposite is actually truer. Just like new useful features in software, evolution teaches us that advances in our behavior are stepping stones to a better core being. Right now we are learning how to deal with the increased understanding of the world with the tools given to us which are the two primary fundamental values (that can be dissected and evaluated even further). Even our modern language is a byproduct of this. We have legions of ways to dissect and analyze our communicative methods, even entire fields of study surrounding this. But it's also simply a tool that's evolved from the fundamental values to better keep them. Meaning even modern language is simply a byproduct and nothing fundamental in our nature. 

But this is what life means, life is a derivative of the two fundamental values, and sometimes it leads to something greater than the former version - in this case, us. One day this might change the norm of what life means. One day this might challenge the entire belief of self. But it also gives understanding to the countless statistics of suicide among pioneers of thought that might have been overwhelmed by the notion of self.

The first 3.5 years of my career so far were spent in an urban, low income, super high crime, violent, busy place.  Money was okay but I was up 24 hours at a time every shift.  Shootings, stabbings, assaults, horrible vehicle accidents, child abuse, sexual assaults, and every medical condition under the sun(because our healthcare system sucks and poor people can't take care of themselves.)  

I had a LOT of bad outcomes.  I saved a lot critical people, but so, so many were beyond saving.  The ones I did save were *usually* not going to have a high quality of life.  Be it paralyzed, brain dead, on daily dialysis, or no longer able to take care of themselves.  It was nothing **I** did wrong, it's just kinda the luck of the draw.  

1.5 years ago I started full time at my current job.  We are much slower, make a lot more money, and the patient population is pretty well off.  Very little violence, very little critical trauma, and everyone has doctors and takes medicine like they are supposed to. I see a *lot* less sick people...the problem is, when I do, they're usually way sicker than the average patient at the old job, because they only call if they *really* need us.

I had several ""clinical saves"" over the past year and a half.  That means they would have died without my intervention.  Most of them were in cardiac arrest, and we got them back, but none of them came out of it without brain damage.  A couple traumas that required rapid intervention to prevent death from blood loss or airway complications, but they were all violent criminals.

Until a couple weeks ago.  

I watched a elderly patient go into cardiac arrest.  I fixed her.  She woke back up.  And now she's back home, with her family, living her life like nothing ever happened.  I talked to her family.  They are so thankful.  I've never had this level of appreciation before.  It's really neat.

Idk why I'm rambling.  I probably won't log back into this account.  I just have to vent.  I don't talk about my job outside of work usually.  My family and girlfriend are all super supportive/proud etc. but I **cringe** hard when people talk about the shit we do outside of work.

The fact is that it was an accident. They escaped. Their new owner is old, I guess she couldn't help it. There is no one to blame, and especially not me that the only thing I did was gave a message.

I had a plan, graduate with a good grades at 22, get a well paying job at 23 and spend the rest of my life making my mom happy because she has sacrificed so much for me and my siblings. I wanted to give her the world because she deserves it and so much more.

Today, I'm 22 (almost 23) and I haven't graduated, my grades are not as good as I thought they would be , I don't have a Job because of how bad the economy is in my country so I still have to ask for financial assistance from my mom and it's killing me. I feel like a disappointment to her. Because of this, I've been distancing myself from my family, I don't pick my mom's call and always come up with excuses why I can't go home during holidays.

Last two month I opened up to my mom and she was really supportive. She said her pride in her children doesn't come from their financial status or how good they were performing in school but the in kind of life they lived. She told me that she will always be proud of me as long as I was living an honest life and I almost cried because I just kept thinking ""this woman deserves so much more than she's getting in life"" and I just ended up feeling even more like a failure. 

Fast forward to today, I'm not picking up calls from her and now I think am depressed because every morning I wake up thinking ""you've failed in life and you're a disappointment to everyone""",04Sep2019,3
111,"for reference, I’m talking about this more in a younger person sense, because well, i’m young 


Let’s say person A comes from a childhood
of negative things. Drug addicted close family members,, messy divorce , and other family issues. However person A uses that as a life lesson. they try to do everything in their power not to fall to addiction, and overall try to be everything their family isn’t 


Person B  has a similar childhood. however They seem saddened at the fact that life gave them these cards. They find themselves in relationships that hurt them and go no where, they self medicate with weed/alcohol to help cope but are still very smart and intelligent(way more than person A). Clearly very intelligent to put themselves on the right path but lack of support and a proper social circle that leave them almost stuck.


Over all what i’m asking, can being in a good relationship kinda save someone from a darker path they might end up on? or as i’ve heard before that U can’t save someone, it will just end up hurting u in the process. Person A is me and there’s someone who I have interest in. It’s not often u get someone who grew up similar to u and can understand u because of the things that both of u went through.  However they clearly had it worse and it reflects but I see potential. I’m asking u guys who are way more experienced and older to explain to me how this all works, thanks",04Sep2019,1
112,"I'm in a theatre program in college which requires you take part in the production of shows to get your theatre degree. My focus is acting. It's what I'm good at and what I love. So naturally, I want to participate by being in the actual shows. 

My first semester went really horrible. The other kids bullied me to the point that I was crying when I went home for the night, and I ultimately had to quit theater and drop my major because it got so bad. The director of the show told me it wasn't her problem that I was being bullied because her job ""is to put on a production at the end of the day, not facilitate relationships"". (For anyone non-theatre, that's not true. The director is literally in charge of making sure everyone feels safe, comfortable, and respected in the company. She knew about the bullying and turned a blind eye.) I ended up going to the Dean of the theatre portion of the school to tell what I had said, and he genuinely listened to me and addressed these concerns later (it comes up again further in this post).

Then last year (two years after the bullying and after I quit theater), I did some community theater and remembered just how much I love being onstage and realized I couldn't stay away anymore, regardless of how scared I was. So, I asked to have that major put back on my transcript to pick up where I had dropped it. I became the assistant stage manager for a show, and was doing fine (mostly). There was a new clause in the contract for players that none of what I had reported years prior would be allowed to go on any longer, as multiple students had complained of the same bad treatment after I had come forward, and it was making our department look bad.

I tried to act as though what happened my freshman year was a nightmare I woke up from, no longer real. Then, one of our players got really sick and had to drop out. I was thrown in DURING tech week (week before opening) for the player's part on Monday. I had to learn the whole script before that Friday, when the show opened. I did it. I learned the blocking, the lines, everything. I was so humbled by the praises people gave me, as I didn't feel like I deserved it at the time; I was just doing what I did best and they needed me -- Of course I jumped in! 

So my days continued with that same director as my teacher in classes and so they could see what I was capable of during class. They even said my projection, while staggering at first, was great for the stage. 

Fast forward to this year. We had auditions for a musical and a straight play on this past Thursday. The director for the musical is the same one as the play I was bullied from. I was not asked to come back for the straight play, but got a callback for the musical. That was last night. I thought I did alright. Heh. I thought. The first rehearsal is tomorrow. I received an email that I wasn't accepted for any part in either play. So let's recap;

I've proven my theatrical ability, flexibility, dependability, and so forth. I literally saved last semester's show, and remember that I am only just NOW accepting the praise I was given. And I HAVE to do something in the theatre to get my credit to graduate. And I wasn't accepted for a part. 

I'm bitter, but I don't want to admit it. I want to believe everything is happening for a reason and that it'll be okay. But I'm hurt. And I don't know what to do. I can't go outside the college to a theatre and get credit; I have to work WITHIN my college. I'm so lost and confused.",04Sep2019,2
113,"I actually thought I had escaped...that it was finally over. Some part of me knew the truth, but on a conscious level I was genuinely convinced that I had a chance. But we all know that in this vile shithole of a world, nothing can *ever* truly be wonderful.

As for how I got here: I started going to a new watering hole 3 months ago. One of the first few times, this drunk, ridiculously attractive chick comes in. Out of nowhere she comes up to me and starts grinding on me, like hardcore, after making suggestive comments. That was the first thing remotely sexual to ever happen to me and I was flabbergasted.

So in hopes of seeing her again I keep coming back to this place. Turns out she works there. She doesn't say much to me while at work...until 7 weeks ago. She comes in again on her night off, and after initially ignoring me comes up once again and kisses me on the lips (my first kiss ever), and grinds on me again. For the following several weeks she again behaves as if nothing happened. We talked a few times but nothing more than bartender-customer stuff.

The period in this window was among the greatest times of my life, with that night undoubtedly being in the top 3 days. I had not felt this kind of pure, genuine happiness and optimism since I was a child. My entire adult life has, with few exceptions, resembled a zombie-like state devoid of enjoyment and it appeared that I had finally broken away from this cage. But that more experienced, realistic part of me knew that there would come an end -- that I would have to pay the piper, and that time was coming sooner rather than later.

Then Sunday night happened. Seven weeks to the day from my special night. She comes in on a night off, completely ignores me and almost everyone else except some old dude (like 60/70-something) that she proceeds to rub and drool all over. On the way home I considered crashing my car into the side of a building and just fucking ending it. I had a dream where we got together, and then woke up yesterday to the worst morning of my entire life.

This also gave evidence for a suspicion that I had tried very hard to bury deep into the recesses of my mind -- that those first two nights meant absolutely nothing. Much like my life in general that, if I found out was going to end soon, would not phase me in the least. Because I'm back in the shit pit, and barring a miracle will never escape.

Thanks for reading, I don't have anyone I can talk to in real life about this.",04Sep2019,1
114,I’ve been debating pretending to be younger (like in my 20s) and not married. Basically because I’m disabled and home alone all day while my wife is at work. I literally have nobody to talk to.

119,"(Sorry for grammar mistakes)So some of you maybe know the Ukrainian revolution in 2014. So everything is getting worse. Now we have CIVIL FUCKING WAR SPONSORED BY THE BIGGEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. It have been 5 years since the war started ,Hundreds of people died for the EU and nobody seems to care. More than 10000 people died and still dying,country lost more than 7 million people. Crimea is still annexed. AND THE MOST FUCKING MAD THING THAT RUSSIA IS CAPTURED UKRAINIAN SHIPS WITH PEOPLE. That's unacceptable, ITS SILENT WAR people are still captured,Russia is taking Black sea over and terrorists are still killing. My dad is currently in Army. And I am scared! He can die at any time! A lot of cities and villages are destroyed a lot of people are homeless because of war. And the most FUNNY(?) Thing is ""Minsk agreements"" I think that's how it translates to English. So in that document written that Ukrainian army and DNR (terrorists) have peace treat(I don't know am I translated it right) So basically nobody attacks each other BUT it seems like DNR don't fucking mind, they're still shooting,the people are still emigrating,the Nazis (?) are rising in popularity.

She proudly sends me the upgraded Godzilla, complete with her name signed in the corner, and it really pissed me off. She's always been a great artist, and I've been aspiring to become one as well. So when I make something that I think is good, she's the first person I send it to.

124,"Just 5 months ago I was crying myself to sleep in a bed next to a woman who no longer loved me and hadn't for some time. That's when I could even get to sleep. Most nights I'd lie awake for hours thinking of going and buying a shotgun and blowing my brains out. I was also jobless and days away from being homeless. I was also pretty overweight and had no friends in the area I lived to speak of. 

Not even a half a year later and I have a good job, a place to live, I'm 40lbs down (still have more to go). I go to the gym 3 days a week. I put a lot of time into reading self help and changed my outlook on life and relationships. I'm poly and dating 2 women that I adore and they feel the same about me, and I have a new best friend that I bonded with over our shared depression at the time and now feels like we'll be friends for life.

130,"I was in an emotionally abusive friendship for over a year with my ex-best friend, Isabelle*.

Isabelle would guilt trip me constantly, not acknowledge the fact that she had flaws, seek consistent and constant validation, twist words of others, yell, scream, and drink, smoke, all sorts of things I was incredibly uncomfortable with.

She has been through abuse herself, and is raised by narcissists. She's grown up wealthy, and has exploited that constantly. She has suffered things that I would never wish upon anyone. 

Abuse gives nobody the right to mistreat people.

Everyone can grow and change, and trauma is one of those things that's hard to push past, but I know that there's a section of functionality that could be reached by her that she just refuses to attain.

When I realized how bad I was being treated, my first thought was being able to cut her off. I avoided her throughout the entire summer, though I knew she'd be there when I got back to school and in my clubs and activities.

So, when confronted today about how I had just abandoned her and stopped talking to her, after being guilt-tripped and struggling through my first day of forced interaction, I managed this text:

""it isn't that i don't want to talk to you, i miss you a lot sometimes. i've limited my social circle to people who i feel benefit me mentally more than the people i was hanging out with. i want you to be a part of my life, but it'd just be a smaller part than before. i don't think you're a terrible person or anything, i told you i'd always love you and i still do but i got into a very anxious and depressed state mentally when i was closer to you and more of the people who fall closer into your circle and i've been happier since separating from it.""

And I'm damn proud of it.",04Sep2019,7
