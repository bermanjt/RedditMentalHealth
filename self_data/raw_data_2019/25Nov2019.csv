0,"Just wanted to vent about this. Today I had brunch with some friends and everyone else seemed to be enjoying themselves, but about a third of the way through, I started feeling melancholy and I couldn't shake the feeling that I really wanted to go home and be with my family. I just clammed up and occasionally faked interest / laughter in the conversation, but my heart wasn't really in it. After brunch some of my friends offered to give me a lift home, but I pretended I was going to run some errands on the other side of town (where I knew none of them lived close to) so that I could take the bus alone.

And then I went home, with a brief detour at the supermarket where I spontaneously bought a big ass box of Ferrero Rocher like I was Forrest fuckin' Gump, and I ate all the chocolates with my parents and my brother ten minutes later. And I was infinitely happier doing that than I had been during the majority of the brunch with my friends.

I'm honestly not really sure why I wanted to GTFO today. I'm close with my family and they're cool, but quite frankly I rarely feel the urge to drop everything and be with them. The desire to go home was just overwhelmingly strong today and I have no clue why. I'm pretty sure my closest friend noticed something was a bit off with me, but I honestly didn't know what to do and I couldn't pinpoint why I felt like such an antisocial asshole among friends. I feel better now that I'm at home but I also feel pissed off at the suspicion that I might have killed the mood a bit, and none of them did anything to deserve it.",25Nov2019,1
1,"Sorry this is quite long. 

Today has been probably the most emotional day of my life and I just need to vent it, hear advice, anything really.

I (F, 20) took a pregnancy test today and it was positive, I fell to the floor in tears and had a panic attack. I took a second test as well to confirm. I'm in my second year of University and have had the worst year of my life. I developed Epilepsy, was robbed of £2,000 (my student loan) from my (then) boyfriend, lost pretty much all my friends from this, I've struggled through Uni, lost loads of weight due to malnutrition and am still pretty suicidal. I just went back on anti depressants recently and am on medication to stop my seizures.

I cannot in anyway have a baby now. I am still behind at uni due to my problems last year and am finally in a good position with it and my finances and then this bomb drops on me. I know it's my fault and I should of been more careful I really do but I'm stupid. I had a theory I was infertile as well so I was extra stupid.

I know I need to get rid of it, every single thing in my life points towards this being the worst possible timing. And I always said that if I got pregnant before I finished uni and settled into a career, I'd probably have to have an abortion. Gosh even typing that hurts. I've also always not really liked kids that much.

But I can't help thinking about being a Mum, I didn't have a great childhood and I'd love to treat someone the way I always wanted to be treated. I want to raise someone the best I can and make them have the most amazing life and love them so much. And this just hurts beyond believe. I didn't think it would I guess.

My boyfriend knows and is very supportive and upset himself. He told one of our best friends who proceeded to laugh in his face for a few minutes, tell him how stupid we are, talk about how they perform late term abortions (I'm only a few weeks pregnant) and then start shopping online for baby clothes after he said we weren't keeping it. Like, if our best friends can't even be there for us then what hope do I even have of getting over this? 

I'm not really sure what I'm looking for here, I'm just devastated that I'm probably going to have to do this. I feel like I love it but I don't even want it. It's the weirdest feeling of my life.",25Nov2019,1
2,"this is my (24f) first night sober this month, and it’s only because i’ve run out of money. 
i’ve finally wrung my savings account dry and i have to survive solely on my income of £500 (£380 of which goes on rent/bills) per month. 
if i don’t stop now i’ll have to choose between wine and food every single day from now on until i either become completely helpless or find a better job.
the main issue there being i have various mental illnesses and i find the part time work i’m doing atm overwhelming as it is. i feel so trapped and scared. 

my drinking has never been too wild, though of course i’ve had moments. but mostly i just drink alone while i work on paintings or i drink with pals or family in the evenings. i don’t eat a lot and i’m a fairly small person so i can get pretty fucked on a bottle of red wine but i often drink more. 
the thing is i don’t really suffer hangovers or any very negative side effects, i’ve only had alcohol poisoning twice in my 7 years of drinking, i’ve only blacked out or done something regrettable a handful of times. 
mostly it just allows me to cry and release painful feelings, mostly it makes me feel completely relaxed and free of negative thoughts. it’s hard because i don’t really have a reason to stop, aside from money. 
i know it’s not good that i drink almost every night, usually completely alone. i know it’s bad i can’t go an hour without wishing i had a drink in my hand and i know it’s bad that i’ve told a lot of people close to me that i’ve been drinking less recently it’s bad that i’m hiding it and i know that but i’m not That bad. i know i cant stop but it’s reasonably in control ? and
i’m just finding it more and more difficult to care about myself lately, i’m a failure; no career aspirations, no money, no partner, i’m ageing, i’m still unwell, i still cut myself, i still can’t stick to anything
so it’s becoming more of a reality that i Will choose wine over food most days, because i’d rather feel warm alcoholic relief than the air in my brutally cold  dark flat",25Nov2019,1

6,"I am 22 years old. I always had a hard time standing up for myself and this is one of the reasons. If someone is trying to take advantage of you and they are trying to use you to do something that you don't want to do. If you refuse to do it and they respond by getting angry and hostile, how do you handle that?

Also let's say you have friends or family members that make ""jokes"" about you that you don't find funny and you call them out on it. If they respond by saying ""We were just joking"", ""You're being too sensitive"", how do you respond?

If I have a different opinion on a subject from someone, and the other person makes me feel bad and judges me for having a different opinion from them, what do you do?

If I am being disrespected, and I stand up for myself and the other person gets angry and furious, how do I handle that?

I have been ran over, pushed around, and disrespected my entire life and I had enough of putting up with other people's crap. I have been dealing with this from friends and family members.

The problem is though I have a hard time setting boundaries and being assertive out of fear of confrontation. I don't want people to be mad at me or upset with me. However, I don't want to continue to be treated like crap.

How do I effectively stand up for myself?",25Nov2019,1
7,"Friday was my 6 months with my boyfriend, and while I know it’s not terribly important, it still meant something to us. He was away in a city about 415 miles away from me for work the whole week, and still won’t be back until the end of this week. After getting home from work on Friday, I got surprised by a flower delivery. He ordered beautiful flowers and a box of chocolates for me, and sent a sweet message in a little card. It really made my heart melt! 

He didn’t have to get me anything but it was a sweet gesture to let me know he cares and is thinking of me, and it means a lot! I’m not used to guys in the past putting in much effort for me even when we’re in the same city, and my boyfriend went above and beyond from far away and while he’s crazy busy and stressed. 

I’m sorry for the long post but I’m just so happy and love him so much and my heart is so full! I never thought I’d find someone like him but I’ve found my person!",25Nov2019,1
8,"Okay so my dad and I have never been close. He was always a workaholic and when he was home he was a hot headed jerk. I was literally scared of him as a child because of the rage outburst he would get into over spilled milk. It was traumatic for me. My parents have always been kinda selfish. They always had a Love/hate relationship but when it came to caring for us kids it was always my mom that we depended on and dad was just a dude that came around sometimes and we where lucky if alone with him that we could keep him happy and avoid him going ballistic on us. He never was a dad, but he was a provider. Now I’m an adult and my parents have divorced after going back and forth forever. My dad in the beginning of the divorce was always pissed off and would call me talking terrible about my mother, obviously upset that she wanted to leave him- but I had enough and told him not to bad mouth her to me. He agreed, apologized and moved on. We got to a point a few months later where he got along with my mom and him and I actually hanged out and enjoyed spending time together. I really liked for once the feeling of actually having a dad. Then like a switch he didn’t call, text or anything for two weeks. He then calls me pissed off because he felt my mom was misleading him. Which she wasn’t! My mom would invite my dad to family dinner night so he could be with my brother, grandkids and I. It wasn’t misleading at all. So, he’s upset and starts bad mouthing my mom again to me rather then to her and after that conversation I just haven’t talked to him since. It’s been 2 weeks and his birthday is today but I just don’t feel bad. I don’t want to talk to him, I don’t want to deal with him. I’m tired of his dramatic outburst. I have gone through forgiving him since forever and now I’m at a point where I don’t need too really and I don’t want too. My dad can send me a guilt trip message but I don’t feel anything for it. I’m sorry that I don’t care but I feel like I’m just done. I feel like since a child I was always the one to take the biggest hits from my dad and I’m so tired of it. What should I do? What can I do?",25Nov2019,1
9,"To give you a smidge of background my friends parents are very strict and will not allow my friend to have a phone so instead she bought herself one and hides it from them! 

My friend texts me on Snapchat and asks me to go grab a laptop that her friend (name her Liss) dropped off at her house and didn’t want her parents to find! so I walk over to her street and see some people playing outside on the escooters which I thought cool! Now they can witness me steal a certain computer from their neighbors house! I decided to wait behind a truck till they left but then I saw her dad (T) just sitting on the couch where the computer was supposed to be! I text her T is outside and my dumbass suggests I claim it’s mine since I did bring a laptop to a sleepover the following night! So I walk up to him and ask about the laptop and he says oh yeah! Wondering where that came from! and proceeds to hand me the laptop and fucking condoms which I say are not mine but he says they were all together and I have no guts to refuse so I accept them! I walk half of the street and just stare at the condoms I don’t want to fucking carry these things so I walk back, hide the laptop under a truck and set the condoms on a brick wall next to the drive way by going through someone else’s yard so T wouldn’t see me then book it back to the laptop and back to my house! I come in with just the computer and charger and my mom questions me about it I tell her I m holding it for a friend since her parents are strict. THEN FUCKING T FUCKING DRIVES UP AND KNOCKS ON THE DOOR! He explains the entire situation including how Liss dropped off the computer and gets my mom to have me give up the computer and condoms (don’t have) so I walk out with it and gave it to him and he gives me the oddest look since once again I don’t have the condoms! 
Now that I’m thinking about it there are so many things I could’ve done that would’ve been better or I could have just avoided the entire thing. In the end my efforts were in vain and my friend is going to get an ass kicking! 
So to my friend’s friend Liss I hate you! Thank you for making me go through that by leaving condoms there too probably as a joke which was not funny and I’m still shaking! :D",25Nov2019,1
10,"For all my life I feel like video games defined who I was and I'm even in school to learn how to make them, but I just hate video games so much since last year. They all seem the same to me, and just feel boring. Tried branching away from the games I usually play to try different genres or indie titles, but I feel nothing.

I just feel lost now in life. I always wanted to work in the games industry but I don't enjoy programming, don't want to work on a carbon copy AAA title in the future. And it's so hard to support yourself as an indie developer. But at the same time, all I think about is games because that has been pretty much my only interest for my entire life, I don't know anything else. I don't know what new hobby to get into. And if I'm not gonna be working in the games industry then what will I do for a career now? I feel lost and empty, like life has no meaning or purpose anymore.

13,"The truth is that we are very different people than when we met and hit it off many years ago. I do look back with fond memories of what used to be, but I have come to realize that those memories will never happen again.

Both of us are too different both in personality and circumstance. And, that is ok. What was not okay was how we treated each other and I apologize for my part. I was not strong enough to walk away for good and the guilt I felt for walking away kept me coming back. It was a vicious cycle that was entirely my fault. To this day I wish I had the strength and wisdom that I have today, so I could have just stopped it.

I never knew when your games really started, but I deserved all of it as punishment for not being strong enough.

But, I am strong enough now and I will normalize what our current state is. We are strangers, and that is ok. There will be a day where we will figuratively smile at each other in public, like strangers who share just a moment of awkwardness, and there will be nothing more than that. Neither of us will think anything more of it. I think this is the most ideal outcome considering everything that has happened.

The person I once knew is gone and what remains is a stranger. And that is ok for the person I once was is gone and, to you, I am nothing more than a stranger.

I feel if I can't see a future with my girlfriend then we need to move on from each other.

It's to the point where I enjoy the time away from her more than the time with her.

After being around for that time i realized it was not only men helping men to improve their sexual strategies but was full of men who were hurt by life and past unsuccessful encounters with women so they rant there, find men with similar ideas and fester their wounds, are filled up with hate and resentment towards society, women and other men who don't share their opinions.

They think realizing that being masculine and having traits that women are attracted to is ""the red pill"" aka awakening and everyone who is not masculine enough in their eyes, is against that sub or anyone who calls to a logical argument is ""blue pill"" or a ""beta"", ""cuck"", etc., etc. 

I was just banned by mods in that sub because i replied to a post in a civil manner and warned an OP to not get ""black hearted"" from all the hurt he received. OP was promoting red pill extremism and saying ""either you are with us or against us"" and had 200 upvotes. I did not insulted anyone, nor hate speeched nor used swears but banned merely because i was trying to show empathy to those damaged men.

I haven’t even seen him naked in months and we live together. He dresses in the bathroom and refuses to strip down further than underwear in front of me. 
I mean, I don’t know or really think that it’s a conscious decision he makes. But it’s getting to me so badly. I miss him, I miss his body, I miss being close to him. It’s like I have a roommate who kisses me sometimes, not a father of my baby, not a boyfriend/future husband... I feel like pregnancy has made me disgusting and ugly in the first place, and I don’t see it ever changing once she’s here. I don’t know what to do and I feel like I’m just being stupid and it’s all in my head. But I miss him so badly. I miss him.

46,"How would you feel as a 33M if a 26F whom you taken on several nice/expensive dates, sent you a disclaimer message. This is a rough draft—

So I need to be honest about something with you, which is that you have definitely captivated my interest and I would be interested in continuing to slowly progress our relationship between each other. I am comfortable with you seeing other people at this time if that is something you would still like to do, which is why I emphasize my desire to take anything that potentially builds between us, in a slow fashion. Essentially I don’t want to be just a fuck buddy, I’d like to know that I am in your consideration as as you get to know me.                    
But with that I also need you to consider that I am 26, and I’m sure as you’ve noticed am still very much growing and developing myself, knowledge and opinions, etc., especially while still in school. Therefore you’d have to be an individual whose confident and encouraging to my growth process, just the same as you would expect me to be for yourself.  
Additionally I’d like to preface that I need an individual with true self confidence and is able to genuinely understand and empathize with individuals from all aspects of life. You will find my life story is very different from most others. But the personality which has intrigued your interest has been shaped by my experiences. I wouldn’t be where I am in life had those experienced not been had, and I am proud of who I am, where I am, what I have accomplished, and what I am accomplishing. 
In such, if your red flags aren’t flying high, that is my full, long winded something I needed to get off my chest and would like for you to please consider.

The things that made me happy from the past now make me sad because things are no longer the same way, and when I think about things in the future that would make me happy I end up feeling sad as well because things aren’t like that now and it’s only a daydream.

I just came home from an amazing weekend with my wife only to find that while we were gone our house was burglarized.

It went from being one of the best weekends I have had in a long time to being possibly the worst thing that has happened to me.  We have been struggling through medical and financial issues(because of the medical stuff) and getting away for a weekend was great. Coming home to this just shattered everything and the two of us spent the last couple hours just crying about stuff. 

Its also amazing learning the things you really value more the anything else. They took tons of electronics and tools and other equipment but I would let them keep all of that if they had just missed my wife's wedding and engagement rings. And the camera that had all of the pictures from our wedding that was just last month. I hadn't even taken the time to offload them to my computer (not that it would have mattered because they took that as well.)

The police gave me very little to hope for. I am going to go check pawn shops tomorrow because I don't know what else to do. Replacing all the stuff we list is just one more burden in what's been an emotionally stressful year.

55,"  Many people say masturbation, also known as self-pollution, self-abuse, self-stimulation, etc  is a perfectly natural act, but it's something you may not want your child to do.  Maybe you have a religion where it is a sin, or people go to their bedroom a lot. Maybe you don't want him messing up the sheets, or just don't want them doing it in your house. However it is actually easy to curb it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Monitor what they watch.** Children are easily influenced by the media; programs such as Family Guy, South Park, The Simpsons, etc (which can be very sexual in nature) should be banned in your household. In general, TV should be minimized, and use of educational books and interactive family time maximized   


**Make sure they take showers frequently, but not for too long.** Not taking showers causes the genital area to itch, and so they might scratch there a bit too much. Long showers could mean they are doing it in the shower, and semen clogs up plumbing. 

 **Use light bed sheets so it is easy to see if he is doing it under the sheets.** Privacy is fuel for masturbation. 

   
**If your child is going through puberty, it is almost certain he is masturbating.** If you don't want people barging in on him, remove bedroom doors to stop it in the first place. 

 **Remove any lotions are lubricants; this should temporarily deter them.**",25Nov2019,1

I think soon enough, I'll probably be posting it online. For the last few days, I've been racking my brains out trying to get several of my last details in order and fill any existing holes. It hasn't been easy and I exhausted myself to the point of stopping early, but today, I think I got it! Here's a breakdown

""At the universe's inception, omnipotent god-like spirits were created from the fragment of creation. The spirits were divided between two groups in way of thought: The prosperity spirits, who always sought peaceful resolution and reign, and the spirits of conflict, who competitive and saw fault in everything. Though they had great power over the physical world, they were by no means invincible and could be killed by each other; these spirits did not regenerate and however many were born at the creation is the total number that will ever exist. In one world, these spirits would engage in war. Many of these spirits would be killed and the world was slashed and scorched to its foundation. However, from the ruins of that world and the ashes of the fallen spirits arose life. Unlike the spirits, life could continuously reproduce and give way to life from what was and though weaker than the spirits, it shared the traits of both classes; they would perish at life's end. The prosperity spirits were amazed at life's creation and decided it would work to help them grow collectively and hopefully replenish the souls lost to that terrible war. The conflict spirits, however, were divided. Some were also willing to help, though not with selfless intent; others believed the new creation to be inherently flawed and some even saw them as abominations and profaned their fallen and must be eradicated. Thus, these spirits would work to make the happenings of the world; they would be responsible for the weather, climate, disasters, luck, and other factors. Today, both spirit classes are worshipped as Gods with respective roles.""

74,"I feel like I'm being put in kind of a crappy spot right now  

I have a friend group that's pretty small but we're all really close friends of about 8 years  

A few years ago Jake started dating Tricia. We all wanted to like her and get along with her. I was still trying long after everyone else had said they didn't like her. Even when I was the only one still trying to be friends with her, she would be the meanest to me. Screaming at me for no reason, yelling at me to fuck off, calling me vulgar names, putting down my house any time I would invite them over for dinner - literally anything she could do to hurt my feelings she would and Jake would just sit there and say nothing  

I have never said anything to Jake about Tricia, but our other friends have after they saw her get drunk and threaten Jake that if he didn't do what she wanted she was going to call the police and claim that he was physically abusing her and that it would make him lose his job and she would do whatever she could to ruin his life  

She has been trying to get Jake to marry her and has gone as far as to lie about her job not offering health benefits  

Well, last night Jake texted me and asked for my help picking out an engagement ring  

I kind of had a feeling it was coming, but I guess I was still hoping that he would end things and get into a healthier relationship with someone else  

I am having trouble with this because Jake has basically removed himself from our friend group. They rarely come out when we invite them, they only hang out with Tricia's friends now, we never talk or text anymore so it kind of stinks that he's only reaching out when he needs something  

I want to be supportive of him, but I'm having a hard time with it and I definitely will not share this private information with our friends because 1) it's not my information to share, and 2) I'm pretty confident that if I did tell them they would probably reach out to him and be like wtf are you doing  

So I feel like I'm in between a rock and a hard place. There's no point in having that ""hey are you sure about this"" conversation, because everyone else has been for years and the only thing it has seemed to do is push a wedge in those friendships

I've been in a relationship with my SO for a few years. We have been long distance for a year and that is going to end really soon. I love SO very much and I'm ecstatic that we're finally going to live together. However, SO gets bouts of depression and I don't know how much I can/should support them.

It comes and goes in waves and often appears to come with a lot of self doubt and doubt about ""us"". I always try to be supportive, always say that they could have come to me earlier if they were feeling uneasy, try to talk things through and try not to suggest solutions unless SO asks for them. However, recently it has gotten tiring. Specifically when we began long distance it seems like these bouts come like clockwork.

Every 2 months after (from my perspective) business as usual, I will get a gut-wrenching text about SO having felt uneasy about sex/our future/their career/our location. I will never see it coming, and SO will reveal that they've been having these thoughts for ""a while"". These texts always come at night when we're both trying to go to sleep, and anecdotally they come when I am either having a good time or a bad time in my own life. We talk, we feel better, we move on, but then we repeat.

I'm in it for the long haul with SO. I would never break up because of SO's depression, but at this point it feels like it's a third wheel in our relationship. Popping up at times that from my perspective seem very convenient (as if it were saying ""how dare you be happy?"" or ""how dare you have a worse day than me?""). At this point I don't know what to do. SO truthfully does not have the time or resources to see a therapist (they are on meds). I don't know how many times I can be dragged down only to replay the same scenario. I feel untruthful saying the same things to help SO; untruthful because I've said them before, not that I am lying.

I feel like I'm an emotional dumping ground who has to bear a burden every time depression comes knocking. But... does this come with the territory of loving someone with depression? Is there a line for how much I should help? I truly want to help and support as much as I can, but how can I when it never feels like enough?

Instead I’ve been cleaning, playing a lot of Destiny 2, cooking, doing small things I need to get done. But the same feeling always persists, I should always be doing something. 

I’ve been wondering if I should take the break to literally do nothing, and my mind get used to being okay with having lots of downtime. It really stresses me out, and sometimes I wonder if I’m just blowing through my life.

And drugs crept in and I realized that if I didn’t go cold turkey I wouldn’t stop. So I did. (Also thanks to a certain somebody for the inspiration.)

Then on Thursday I decided I could handle a night out. It was wild. Then last night, again.... why does everyone always have coke on them? 

I’m really disappointed in myself. It didn’t make me feel good. Why did I do it?

I have a new goal of sobriety now: 1 year from today. And always, I guess. I just don’t like how wild it gets every single time. I like being sober.",25Nov2019,1

I (23M) may come off as an asshole here.

I lost a lot of weight recently and now considered good looking. Now I'm getting a lot of attention from women, and when I've been out to clubs, I've had lots of women aggressively hit on me, pretty obviously saying sexual things too. Also on Tinder, they've been upfront.

Now I'm no incel, I don't hate women and I can see why they weren't attracted to me.before, but since this has happened, **I'm feeling a lot of Nihilism, essentially a lot of meaninglessness**.

I feel meaninglesness from this. It's not destructive or anything, but sometimes I feel a low level of annoyance towards these women.

At the risk of sounding pretentious, **I feel like Superman from Man of Steel (2013).** He is gifted with great power but sees it as a burden. 

I'm not one of these guys who can have a good time with these girls and be grateful. I see it as a burden because I feel nihilism.since it started.happening. Why should I be happy and smiling? I've had sex with some of them.but only for the pleasure.

They are really good at what they do though and use their knowledge to crush me at work.

I recently started a role (3 months ago) and there’s a lot to learn, it’s not a simple one, but the person I work with the most is the same woman 22 years old living with her parents, needy, controlling and passive aggressive. She also has many connections in the company.

This is my worst nightmare at my workplace but I absolutely love the company I work for. It is a top 5 employer in the world one of the big 4.

I accumulated so many things thinking that somehow they can help in any situation in the future. My brain is constantly forgetting things (ADHD, maybe?) and this practice can help sometimes but I'm often thinking to myself:

&gt;*What about this? It can help me now? The thing that I'm choosing to do now is the best alternative? Am I doing the right thing? I'm not going to uninstall this app or delete this note, I think it will be useful hereafter.*

I'm trapped and paralyzed by analysis. I want things to be perfect planned and when I plan them, I can't act accordingly because somehow they don't spark joy anymore.

I have a tremendous difficulty to finish something. When I think I made the perfect choice, they turn out to be a struggle to go through the end and later I give up.

&gt;*Oh what about this book? It's great for me to read this now... Then eventually I found another one and start to read and forget about the old one.*

I want to learn how to do one thing and master it. I want to rebuild myself in a way that I can organize and structure only the really important things. I want to finish projects, to achieve one goal at a time.

I find beautiful some people dedicated to one thing and one thing only. But I can't be like them because I shift my focus everytime :(

99,"I'm not social at all and had no friends until last year where I met someone and we got too close and became really good friends. But things didn't go well lately and he started making space. I felt the change, clung, but nothing helped until I eventually allowed him to have his space. I know what bothered him with me, I can't talk about it with him because I'm not supposed to know anything (yes, he's talking about me to other people and thinks they'll keep his secrets like I did).

Now, we don't talk at all, we don't look each other in the eyes but we meet on a daily basis for over 6 hours a day and it's driving me crazy. I can't talk to him because I must keep the secret his friends told me, he chose to drop me instead of talking with me about everything so I guess what's right is just getting over him. But it's so hard, I've never been close to someone before, never been blindly trusted to that point, never been appreciated and unused for someone's benefits but shit happened... he's always in my mind. I have no one else to kill time with so I just sit there, with my nostalgic personality, thinking about the good times we had and what if nothing happened and we're still friends etc.. basically all scenarios that I wanted to happen/happened and want to live again. I see him with other people he didn't like before and say to myself ""so he'd rather be around that person who he really disliked instead of me?""

Anyway, I just can't get over him. we had a very solid relationship to be given up on (at least for me), I can't distract myself from him because as I said we meet on a daily basis for at least 6 hours, I'm drowining in the past and have no hobby/ activity to do without him involved because we were so close that we played the same games together etc so even if I try to evade everything he's always in my way. and I have no one else to talk to and distract myself until I get over him. I am convinced that he's gone, but there's that small ray of hope that just can't vanish. any suggestions are really appreciated and thanks in advance (I CAN'T TALK TO HIM, IT'S NOT AN OPTION, I MUST ACT LIKE I KNOW NOTHING AND KEEP THE SECRET HIS FRIENDS TOLD ME).",25Nov2019,1

101,"This is going to seem rather dumb but it has been in my mind for quite some time. I’m 27M. And a few weeks ago my gf brought up a very odd topic. She was talking about taking my last name if/ when we marry. Or rather not taking my name. 

It began by asking me about my father. Quick backstory, he’s a deplorable cunt who lied, cheated, and betrayed anyone who’s ever cared for him. Including me. Haven’t seen him in over a decade. She specifically asked me if it bothered me that I had his last name. It doesn’t. I may have inherited his name but he sure as shit didn’t teach me what it meant. That was my grandfather. My fathers father. I am only a 2nd generation American. When my grandfather was 16 he enlisted the US Navy. When the war was over the US gave him his citizenship. Quite frankly I think he’s more American than most Americans. He was willing to risk his life for the chance to become an American. Most people wouldn’t risk there life to stay American but that’s a discussion for a different thread. I’m proud of my name. 

After telling her this she dropped the well I’m keeping my name if we marry. Which I don’t give a shit about really. She’s proud of her name too. Seeded deep in America’s history and all. But then she said if we have kids they will have her last name / she gets to name the kids no dissuasion. And that I should take her name because my father is a deplorable cunt. 

This rubbed me very wrong. So my grandfathers legacy dies. The name I carry belongs to a true American hero will be forgotten. It can’t even be the middle name because “she gets to name them no discussion”. 

I find it frustrating that she put this demand (for lack of a better word) on me but if I put the very same demand on her it would be a travesty. 

I am by no means making and decision yet. We are both not read for that stuff anyway but I will have to think about this. If names are such a big deal for her than they can be for me. 

I am hoping to spark some scintillating discussion. By no means come to a conclusion tonight it perhaps help me see things differently. Get Reddit’s candor.",25Nov2019,1

Then she tells me she wants to go out for breakfast. I tell her, “Ok, but I didn’t really sleep last night and I’m really tired so I don’t know”
She says, “Alright,” in this passive aggressive, offended tone. 

Then a few hours later, she comes in my room and I’m still tired. And she tells me to get up. I told her I didn’t sleep until 4:30 last night and she says she feels like I’m sleeping my whole life away?

 One day after work a friend invited me to a party, I told him hell I’ll go with you, biggest mistake of my life... I took a slip into heroin. I was a addict for about 7 years. They were offering free drugs to those who were willing to go out and sling meth, I obviously took him up on the offer and in one week I made $11200 which I was suppose to give to them in exchange for drugs. I decided I was gonna make a run for it and get my wife and start a new life and both of us get sober. While packing my shit at my house my wife called and told them my plan. They came by in a white Chevrolet... still remember the license plate number. They held me at gun point and made me get in the vehicle, my wife had the money at the moment. The ride was very quiet I known why I was there and they known that. What I didn’t know was the pain that would ensue, 3 days I was burnt with cigarettes, beat, starved, and even water boarded with diesel and set on fire which disfigured part face and chest.

Due to my screaming during the torture a neighbor heard and called the police. They had me in a upstairs bedroom and when the police came a man ran up stairs and held me gun point and said if yelled I was a dead man, I screamed for help knowing good well he wouldn’t shoot me with a officer so close. The officer heard me and so did the man down stairs he slammed the door on the officer and then I’m guessing called for back up and basically held me hostage for about 2 and half hours until finally commiting suicide after this the second man surrendered 

I was rushed to the hospital and had to have skin graphs done and found out I had pneumonia plus a staff infection. I took a plea deal got no charges or anything against me for testifying and giving statements and showing them the location of a local meth lab.

All these years later there’s still stuff that’s sets me off, like the smell of diesel or cigarette smoke. I used to never leave the house because I was afraid of what people would think of my scars and such. Now I have a wife and 2 beautiful children... funny how much my life has changed since them, now I get out socialize and do things with my kids even go on a date night with my wife every Saturday.

I tried to keep it going by regularly restarting it and updating the software, but it's been 2.5 years and it kept crashing on me; camera app, email, web browser... And the battery juice just disappears with a mere 1 hour onscreen time. I missed out on capturing such great moments with my friends because either my phone died, or the camera app kept crashing.

I planned to invest in battery replacement as a Christmas treat, but instead, I got the 11 pro 256gb. I spent quite a bit upfront to keep the monthly bill low, and the total cost was 1256 - paying only 56 for the network plan - I thought it was a great deal! Though, my parents have strongly expressed their disappointment in my ability to manage my money. 

I feel so guilty. I feel like I could just live with the faulty one and not complain. Many people don't even have a phone, and they function. 

I feel like I could invest it somewhere else, like contribute it towards a car that I'm planning to buy in the near future. Or even a mattress, though, I don't think it'd make me feel any different throwing all that money on a slab of foam.

I come from a low income family, so having so much money available that I can genuinely spend on myself is completely new to me. I always looked and opted for the cheapest solutions in the past, all to save money to survive another months, and in all honesty, now, I just don't want to carry on living like that. 

I have more than enough for all my bills, and I admit, my first paycheck went for a lot of things I didn't have in the first place: backpack, winter coat, more than one pair of jeans, t-shirts I fit into... So after paying two month's worth of bills, and that, I didn't have as much to put into my savings account. 

I have planned out all my expenses for this year, all accounted for - and with savings too. I work a lot of over time, 10-25 extra hours a week, with intention to save up for university. But at the same time, I know that whilst at uni, I will not be able to afford such goodies, yet I still fail to fully justify the cost. 

Everyday, I see many people own items that are so much more affordable - it makes me not even want to take my phone out in front of my friends. I just feel embarrassed that I've spent so much money on something so trivial.

So ever since I remember, I was always excited about my future. I mean, all kids do is getting prepared for their future really. So at primary school, I always wanted to be an adult, like most kids, and I always knew what I wanted to do later. Then at high school, you notice that life doesn't work like that. For me it became hard to decide what I wanted to do, but I still was never really stressed about it. However now I've left high school, and have already tried 2 studies I didn't like, and I absolutely hate the thought of my own future. There's simply nothing that excites me. I hated school, but went with the thought: 'If I'm doing well at school, I can get a job that I will really like later!' Now I realised jobs are 10 times worse then school.

(Bit of a rant): My mind just can't deal with the adult life. We're all being treated like a bunch of numbers. And we're being slaves to humanity. No, I rather had just survival of the fittest. Even though that means I would've probably been dead already. We have to work 4 or 5 days out of every 7 dammit. Doing the same, OVER and OVER. For the rest of our lives. What a waste!!

I just can't see myself working in a few years. There are no jobs available for the passions I have. Everytime I read a job or study description, I feel super stressed and depressed cause of how boring and stressful it sounds. I don't think I can do it.

I have nephews and nieces that I have never seen before. It is *because* I got away that I am doing well for myself and not 6 foot under.

I don't want to think that way because they were already hiring me, I don't want me crying to effect anything either... I'm not sure how to feel about it other than they probably saw me as weak. I don't wanna think that my crying had any positive effect because that would mean I purposely cried for the job which I didn't; if they change their mind about me, I'd honestly understand and if they still hire me I'd be okay with it.",25Nov2019,1
132,"I am in my mid 20's and have always struggled to have a close connecting relationship with my mother. I am the oldest child and our family has been through a lot like many others. I admit I am very stubborn and connect better with my father since she share the same qualities. However, my entire life I have never been able to tell my mother about personal (relationships, sexual life, serious emotions I have had) like other girls my age have. She is not open and is very judgmental. I think it partially is because of how her parents raised her, very conservative and her parents passed when she was in her 30's. I am in graduate school, still living at home and can't afford to move out until I start working full time and graduate from law school. I have never been able to have guys around my house since I am the oldest child and I really have been struggling with being happy and getting through each day. I don't think I am depressed but the toxic relationship I have had with my mother has seriously been affecting me in all aspects of my daily life. We just don't get along, she screams at me as if I am the worst person in the world if I do the smallest thing she doesn't agree with or try to understand. I don't mean just scream either it gets very physical and mentally abusive. I am a good person. I don't do bad things, I have good grades and a good group of friends. I occasionally go out on the weekends but I take care of myself, do my laundry, clean around the house and also watch after my younger siblings. From the outside, we look like this perfect family but we are really far from it. I am jealous of my friends who are best friends with their mothers and I am stuck between not being able to move out which might help the problem or just giving up completely on trying to fix things, move out work my ass off (use every dollar I have in my savings) and try to afford working part time while in graduate school.",25Nov2019,1
133,"I was washing out a small sample container of BBQ sauce at my sink/counter and  the area is pretty cluttered. 

I keep a paring knife acroos the top of a plastic cup and my shirt's sleeve caught on it and the knife falls and lands tip down into the linoleum right next to my bare left foot. About a centimeter away. When I looked down the knife was still wobbling back and forth. 

And I just stand there kind of stupified as to how lucky I was. Otherwise I'd have to go to the hospital to have it stitched up or worse. Would have cost me a LOT of money. 

Kind of pissed at myself for being so careless. I am usually overly careful about a LOT of things. 

Gonna have to find a better spot to store the knife.",25Nov2019,1
