The premise is that if you listen to Spotify, we can help you understand how your music listening correlates to mood / emotion states (specific for you), as well as giving you new insights around patterns in your moods and emotions over time.

We're a team of mental health passionate people who are all recently out of college, and we're looking to get input from people (we're designing the app specifically for college students) on the concept and the app. We're still in beta so would appreciate y'all signingup and giving us feedback!

1,"For those who don't know what this is, I'll give a brief overview, though I encourage you to do your own Googling and take a more in-depth look at some of these studies. Basically, it's been found that black kids, when compared to white kids (especially black girls compared to white girls) are considered less innocent and more adultlike, and are therefore held to higher levels of accountability and afforded less protection than their Caucasian peers. 

While this is no doubt alarming and needs attention, I'm wondering why the hell nobody is talking about the age implications of these studies. Why is being an adult considered ""bad""? Why would it somehow be harmful for a child to be seen as ""less innocent""? I'll tell you why, because our society fucking FAVORS them over adults, yet nobody seems to want to acknowledge or admit this. It DOES mess with a person's psyche to be stripped of their ability to be treated as vulnerable, and what's even worse is the line between ""vulnerable"" and ""not vulnerable"" is a completely arbitrary point that our lawmakers drew in the sand for convenience sake. I have yet to find one person who was able to find me solid evidence that some kind of magical switch happen's in someone's brain the day they wake up on their 18th birthday, yet that is the age at which you are considered to have reached adulthood in America. 

First of all, how DARE you tell us that we are less innocent just because we hit some arbitrary threshold. Maturity exists on a spectrum. If I were to show you a color gradient strip ranging from deep, dark blue on one end to deep, dark red on the  other, you couldn't make a firm, fixed line at exactly the point at which blue switched to red, because it's NOT clear. That's the same thing with age. There isn't one point at which we magically become grown, and even then it happens at different times for different people. Why can't I still be considered a vulnerable young girl in my early 20s? Why is it that just because I've passed this arbitrary threshold of 18 people assume I'm all-wise and all-knowing and don't still need protection?

I'm not black, and I can't speak for the experiences of those who have experienced this kind of ageism based on their race. But I do know what it's like to feel that your innocent identity has been taken from you, even if you, yourself, don't feel that you've lost it. I'm not denying things like racism and sexism are still big problems in our world, but I think it's high time we started directing some of our attention to a type of bias that's flown under the radar for far too long. These days, people would balk if someone were to say, ""We should prioritize the white man over the black man,"" but most don't blink an eye when people say shit like, ""We should prioritize the child over the adult.""

3,"He’s 4 years older than me (I’m 22) which I think has been a social barrier for the past few years. He also started dating another coworker, but they broke up, which has made it pretty awkward for him to work in the same place. I feel like this has made him afraid to date anyone else at our job.

Also, 2 months ago he posted a picture on facebook with another girl, but I have no idea if they’re still together.

I want to ask him out, I would do it in a heart beat, but I’m so terrified of getting rejected and then having to keep working with him after. 

We have a ton of similarities but every time I’ve tried to be flirtatious in the past, there was some reciprocation but not much effort on his part. He’s either really shy towards girls or he’s trying to get me to take a hint.

My table is next to another group of friends I know, one of which I’ve been friends with for a little while now. I had noticed her and her boyfriend subtly looking at me, which caused me to try to hide myself even more. It’s pretty embarrassing for me, but I managed to pull myself together for the rest of the time. 

Later that day, I come home and one of my friends that sat at the other table tells me that my “friend” had seen me crying, and started laughing hysterically at me. Like, POINTING and laughing at me. I hadn’t noticed before. I felt hurt. I didn’t understand why she would do that; Id always been nice to her. I thought at least she’d be a sympathetic kind of person, so I don’t understand why she’d laugh at my misfortune like that.

9,"The purpose of this post is to gather and reflect on other peoples opinions towards my relationship and also to express myself. I apologize in advance for the length, but the situation is quite complicated and requires explanation.

TL;DR: long distance sucks.

I (24M) have been in a long distance relationship with my partner (21F) for two and a half years. We met in a different continent (where she was living, and where her family still lives) whilst I was on holiday. We found that we both really liked each other and so we met again on a separate occasion. After this, we both decided that we wanted to pursue and build a relationship together, so eventually (two years ago) she moved to the same country as I live, but on the other-side (our cities are about 3000 km apart).  The reason for this is twofold; we wanted to be closer together, but she also wanted to go to a good university to begin her studies (and there wasn't a good quality course on offer in my city for her career path). Her father is relatively wealthy, so he gives her a monthly spending allowance and his job pays for her tuition and her accommodation at one of the university colleges. Due to the nature of her father's job, she doesn't really have a 'home' so to speak, because he is required to move around the world (i.e. she doesn't really have anywhere to fall back to). Nowadays we roughly see each other once every one or two months, for a week or two at a time.

That is the context, and now I will describe the main problems (we are)/(I am) facing. I should begin by saying that we both really do love each other a lot, and we want to be together and make it work. For clarity, and to make it easier to respond, I will number the different problems (but they are all related in some sense).

1. Long distance: Currently she still has two years left of study, and I have (at least) one and a half years left of my PhD, which realistically means that we won't be able to live in the same city for at least another two years. Even after that, there is no guarantee that we will be able to live together because I will be doing research and I'll need to chase the funding (which might take me to places in the world where she can't or doesn't want to work/live). From the beginning we were both aware that this was going to be an obstacle in our relationship, but we didn't care because we wanted to be together. It goes without saying that long distance is difficult, and it is certainly beginning to take its toll (and has been for a while). There is also the uncertainty of not being able to live together after all of this, and if that happens then I don't think our relationship will survive (nor do I think it would be healthy for it to).
2. Jealousy: As much as I would like to try and be the type of partner that is supportive of her friendships, I unfortunately succumb to bouts of jealousy. This is because the majority of her friends are (single, straight) guys, all of which she lives with (at college), and spends a lot of time with.  In particular, they party together (alcohol, drugs, clubs, festivals) and have one-on-one time together (e.g. watching movies in their private rooms, smoking weed, photo shoots, going on holidays to Asia etc etc). There was also one occasion where she was unfaithful, which we have moved past, but which still plays on my mind. I try to be supportive and understanding, but I get jealous that all of these guys get to spend more time with her than I do myself, and get to experience all of these things with her. We have good communication and I have told her many times how I feel regarding this, but usually it boils down to ""this is who I am, and this is the stage I'm at in life (see point #3 for more info) "".  I definitely don't want her to stop hanging out with her guy friends altogether, because I know they're important to her, but there is a line.  But I don't want to be selfish and stop her from being who she is. I must admit, sometimes I do have trouble setting, and most notably, enforcing, my own boundaries (some might call me a pushover). Lately its difficult to tell whether I'm actually OK with various things in our relationship, or if I'm just lying to myself because I want to be supportive (or appear to be).
3. Stages of life: We both seem to be at different stages in life. For the past few years I have been very committed to my research and consequently have been very busy. This is not to say that I don't like to party or have a drink sometimes, because I certainly do, but it is not my priority.  She is at a point in her life where she needs to learn more about herself, have fun with her friends and experience new things.  Obviously the nature of long distance means that I can't be with her for most of these experiences. Sometimes this leads to the jealousy that I mentioned earlier (see point #2).  Personally, I feel like I have done a fair chunk of this soul searching in the years prior to our relationship, which might be why I don't feel the need to party and go clubbing all the time. I keep telling myself that one day she will slow down on the drinking/partying/drugs and focus more on her studies, or get a side job and gain a different type of life experience. But I have been telling myself this for a while now. Perhaps this is an unreasonable expectation. Perhaps this is just who she is and always wants to be. And that's not a bad thing, in fact one of the things I love about her most is how fun it is to be with her. But my idea of fun does not always coincide with hers, and the kind of full on lifestyle that she leads is not something that I am looking for (or can mentally deal with) in the long term. In her defense though, she is still very young (and so am I), and I don't want her to miss out on all of those fun things you do at 21.

With all of these factors at play, the rational section of my mind tells me that it is probably in our best interests to end the relationship. This would allow her to flourish as a person and explore the avenues of life that she wants to, without having the burden of my expectations.  It would also allow me to stop stressing/overthinking about what might be happening while she is experiencing these things (which most likely isn't) . This is not to mention the fact that there is a non-zero chance of us not being able to live together if we manage to get through the next two years of long distance. 

On the other hand, the irrational section of my mind, the part which governs my emotions, strongly opposes the rational part. When we are together physically, everything is so beautiful that it's easy to forget all of the above problems. My feelings for her, and her feelings for me, are so strong that we can't imagine leaving each other and abandoning all that we have experienced together.

 I suppose that I am confused on how to proceed and would like to hear your opinions and criticisms on what I have described (e.g. is one of us being unreasonable/unrealistic, am I being a pushover, is this just the nature of love, do you think our relationship doomed etc etc). Sorry for rambling on, and thanks for listening.",30Oct2019,1
10,"Hi everyone!

Just wanted to share a few things I've learned on teaching people how to treat me with respect.

Because it can be so frustrating and disheartening when someone behaves badly towards us and we wish SO MUCH that they can see their bad behavior and correct it.

But unfortunately, we can't change anyone's rude behavior, but I want to focus on what we can control...and that is us.

So here are 3 examples of how we can be in CONTROL and teach others how to treat us with RESPECT, especially when we find ourselves in awkward and disrespectful situations.

Here's a video I made all about it:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvH97uusFng&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvH97uusFng&amp;feature=youtu.be)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If you prefer reading:

The first way we can teach others how we want to be treated is to

1. Respond don’t React

Say you’re in a good mood, minding your own business. You’re watching your fav youtube channel, and then out of no where your significant other, let’s call him Bob, storms into the room, starts yelling about how enormous the electricity bill is this month. Then he starts blaming it on you, because you like to keep your heater on. And he starts calling you names..like stupid and careless

When this happens, what emotions are you feeling? You’re probably feeling a variety of emotions. Angry that Bob stormed in and yelled, confused as to why the bill is so high, guilty because you think you may be the culprit of the high electricity bill, and mostly hurt because Bob is being disrespectful.

And you’ve got a couple of choices on how to address this situation:

• 1. You can choose to react negatively which means you change your good mood and take on the negativity, which now puts YOU in a BAD mood and then you fight back and start yelling at Bob and calling him names. OR

• 2. You can choose to respond positively. Which means that you don’t engage with his negative actions. Instead you calmly say “I understand that you may be feeling frustrated right now, Bob. However, I don’t want to talk to you when you’re yelling at me and calling me names. I find it completely disrespectful. So, I’m going to leave the room and when you’re a bit more calm, then I’ll be more than happy to talk with you.

See the difference. When we choose to react, we take on whatever emotion the other person is feeling and we wear it. Our good mood gets ruined and we immediately go into a negative headspace.

But when we respond, we’re not going to take on negative emotions. We’re not going to allow ourselves to get pushed down to the other person’s level. We take control of the situation and distance ourselves from it, so it doesn’t affect us at all. When we do this, we TEACH the other person that we don’t accept that kind of behavior towards us.

I like to look at this situation the same as if you were dealing with a toddler throwing a tantrum. Because essentially this is what the other person is doing--acting like a toddler. And If a toddler yelled and screamed at you, you wouldn’t yell and scream back, right? You would calmly explain what is an acceptable way to talk to you. You don’t yell back at them and call them names, because you’ve got to role model and SHOW THROUGH YOUR ACTIONS what is acceptable behavior. That’s how they learn. Right?

The exact same principle applies to adults. Whenever we run into someone who is acting disrespectful towards us, we respond by staying calm and in control of our words and actions, instead of reacting negatively by mimicking the other person’s rude behavior.

The next way we teach people how to treat us is to:

2. Enforce Boundaries

Say you’ve had one of the most stressful work days of your life and you have a coworker who invites you out to dinner. But you are EXHAUSTED and all you can think about is wrapping yourself in a blanket, grabbing your fav snack, and vegging out to your fav Netflix show.

So you’ve got two choices to make when this kind of situation happens: You say yes to your coworker and spend the rest of the evening probably regretting your decision.

Or you can set a boundary and communicate your wants and needs. A boundary is basically understanding what is best for you -emotionally, physically, and mentally. So, in this example, what you may feel is best is to say “no” because you want to rest. So as a response to our coworker we can say “Thanks so much for the invite. I won’t be able to make it tonight but I hope you have fun.”

Now, if we say yes, even if we don’t want to go…we may be the type of person who says yes to everything, regardless of what it is, because we don’t want to disappoint anyone or we don’t want to be seen as the boring person. The problem with this is that we become the “yes person.” People start to know us as the “yes” person, so they think they can ask us to do anything, because we will ALWAYS agree… Why do they do that? Because we’ve unintentionally taught people that’s what we do. If we never stand up for ourselves. If we never say no, then people learn… “oh ok, she says yes to everything, so if I ask anything of her, I know she’ll do it.”

Now, if we have the courage to say no, then sometimes we have someone who doesn’t respect our boundaries and tries to push us to do something anyway. And usually there’s some flattery or guilt thrown in like…

“please it won’t be the same without you!” or...”just this one time…you hardly ever go out” or “you don’t want to leave me hanging do you” Do these responses sound familiar to you? It’s hard to say no when we get these sort of responses, right?

But if we change our response from no to yes…then without even realizing, we teach people that they can push our boundaries if they want a certain response from us.

Again, this situation reminds me of communicating with a child. If a child asks for a piece of chocolate and you tell them they can’t have any…then they may throw a tantrum, or use flattery or try to guilt you by saying “you never let us have chocolate” or “pleaseee I’ve been so good today” you’re the best mom in the whole world”

If you give in and say yes, then that teaches the child that they can push your boundary to get what they want when you say no.

So, whenever we say no, it needs to be firm. Whenever we enforce any kind of boundary, we need to be firm with it.

When we do this, we teach people that we respect ourselves and they should do the same.

The next way we teach people how we want to be treated is by:

3. Communicate Your Feelings

Say you have a family member who always picks on you about your career. In so many words, they tell you that your job isn’t good enough and that you need to make more money. When they do this, it can make you feel angry, upset, or frustrated, because it makes you feel as if you’re not good enough even though you LOVE your job.

When this kind of situation arises, whenever a family member picks on you about something, usually two things happen, o You give the silent treatment and avoid this family member like the plague or 

o You just take it. You sit there. say nothing. and maybe even kinda laugh it off a bit

But when you do those two things, it’s not addressing the issue that is at hand which is: when that family member says unkind words to you, it makes you feel worthless. And because you’re not communicating with that family member, you’re essentially showing them that it’s ok to say those things.

So, what we should do instead is communicate our wants and needs with that family member. We should tell them how we feel when they say something that offends us and that we would appreciate it if they stopped.

Now some family members are completely oblivious when they say hurtful things to us. They aren’t intentionally trying to be mean or hurtful…they just have no idea that what they’re saying is offensive. And it takes us standing up and communicating with them, so they can realize that their words are actually hurtful. When this happens, they usually feel pretty bad and change their behavior.

Other times, you have family members who keep repeating the bad behavior, which at that point, you’ll have to set and enforce some boundaries, which may mean that you have communicate to them that you are going to distance yourself until they are able to correct their behavior.

Otherwise, if you do nothing, they don’t take you seriously and continue with their behavior.",30Oct2019,2

Sometimes I wake up in the morning and I can feel the damage in my lungs and I think hmm I don’t want to die super young. There’s a good chance I’ll end up with lung disease but let’s not rush it.

Other times I want to marinate my already damaged lungs in as much smoke as possible.

I want to light a cig and take a deep drag and hold it in for over 30 seconds as I’ve done so many times before. 

Then I want to test drive another old diesel and take another bong hit of its exhaust.

12,"For a few months, my mood has been rapidly decreasing. Recently, a few really shitty things stacked up. I was feeling miserable, making mental lists of ways the people I know would benefit from my death. I was losing hope, and any will to keep going.

Then one of my friends told me she had a near death experience, and she pushed through because she had people to live for. I was one of them. 

I realized days later, she’s a huge source of hope for me. We’re making a web comic together, and a huge part of why I do anything anymore is so I can work on it. I want to feel like I have a piece of work that I put some of my soul into available for the public.

Not only does the project help, but knowing I have her in my life helps. When I see her, we always end up crying, breathless with laughter. She’s a reason to keep going. 

I think today is a turning point. I’ll push on.",30Oct2019,3
13,"I have always been like this, nobody to truly relate to, kind of lonely, dont get me wrong, I always enjoyed being alone, the silence, it's much better than being in company I dont feel comfortable around.
I was aware finding a person that fits to me would be extremely hard to find, barely possible, and I was okay with that. 
Especially after I had been ill for 3 years, seeing few besides my household during that time and realizing who I was, I was aware of this, I need someone on the same wavelength, who understands and accepts me, what I have gone through.
Then I met him, he is the only one to ever give me that feeling, I am not one to make quick decisions, but then I moved to him i to another country.
Things are going wonderful between us two, I love him like I never loved anything and I feel truly comfortable around him.
Times are very very stressful, and we still thrive.
But sometimes I just feel this kind of loneliness again, while we understand each other very well, our interests differ quite a lot, same with our views on some things and how to handle stuff. 
Which isnt bad at all, different views lead to more interesting discussions, but it still leaves me alone in this country I am not used to, with interests, memories, pains, thoughts, nobody here can understand or relate to.
I really enjoy some silence, I need some down time, time to think and find myself, find inner peace, even if its just a brief moment. 
He on the other hand always needs noise, an air purifier is constantly running making a loud buzzing sound, he also cannot go a minute without looking at his phone when he isnt doing something besides gaming or cuddling, when he does dishes, walks the dog, plays with her, on the toilet, taking a bath, brushing teeth, he always has a video running or  browses reddit. 
It makes me think of when I am very glued to my phone or pc, I begin feeling clouded and like on autopilot, I stop enjoying life itself, I told him that too, but he says  its because of his ADD (he is medicated) that he always has to multitask.
I know maybe this makes me seem selfish, but sometimes I just could cherish the silence with him, enjoy every moment.

17,"I feel like I can’t really talk about how happy I am with where my life is at to anybody without sounding like I’m trying to brag.  Which, I probably am, I feel like I’m so far ahead of other people my age and maybe I’m proud of where I am in life.  I’m 26, I’ve been married for a little over 4 years and we have a 14 month old son.  He was definitely an oopsie since we planned on waiting a little longer, but we had just bought our first house when we found out and I have a job in sales that I’m doing really well in so we were in a really stable place when he came along.  

And goddamn if we didn’t get just the best fucking kid you can imagine.  He’s been sleeping through the night pretty consistently since he was 3 months old,aside from the one off nights when he’s sick with a cold or something, and I just love him to death and can’t wait to come home every day to see him every day—he’s always smiley and giggling at something.  The house has been feeling small with him getting bigger and more mobile, so we are buying a new house and closing this week, moving into a 4 bedroom house that we could totally see having another kid and raising both in for a long time.  A lot of this has been possible because I’ve been able to do really well in my job—when I started 4 years ago I was making a $30K salary/year with the ability to earn commission and bonuses, and now this year I’m going to make $120K and am tracking to be around $140 next year.  

The house, the family, the job...it’s all come together and it’s definitely been a ton of work to get here—nothings ever as easy as it sounds when you just list the highlights but I’m just so damn proud of where we are.  I’m not sure why I’m writing this but I just really felt like gushing about how happy I am I guess.  Thanks for reading if you made it this far.",30Oct2019,3
18,"Whenever I mention to my friends that I've met a new guy I find cute and that we get along really well, they will inevitably ask me to rate the guy from 1-10.  However, I find this incredibly difficult to do.  It's difficult to reduce a human to just a number, and I always have to disclose that their personality is also attractive to me, and it will make me rate them higher because it's easier to overlook typical flaws when I'm just really into them as a person.  Then, my friends will see the same guy and admit that they had a much lower rating for this person than I did, even with me trying my best to be objective.  On that note, no one ever has the same rating for the same person.  What someone will rate as a 8 or a 9, I would say 5 at best.  And what I believe to be a 7, they tell me ""3, maaaaybe 4.""

Beauty is incredibly subjective.  We can all agree that there are flaws that don't help you, like being overweight, having acne, having bad teeth, etc, however, I can't help but notice that a lot of these flaws are also controllable as well.  At this point in my life, I honestly believe that most people are born being at least mildly attractive.  It's the kinds of faces and personalities that lead us to feel attracted to certain subsets of people - a type.  I have a type of face and body I am attracted to, but a close friend of mine has a completely different type that I'm not into. We always rate each other's interests really low and rate our own really high, and it's just interesting to see how different we rate the same person.   I think the way we perceive people is a very individual, subjective experience, and attempting to reduce people to just numbers doesn't help anyone but rather hurts them.  The best we can do is try to be our healthiest and happiest, mentally and physically.",30Oct2019,2

Basically I’m in a new relationship, just six weeks since we’ve been official, maybe two months since we’ve been dating. She’s fantastic, no issues at all, very much see longterm potential. The distance is a slight issue, as she’s still in college and had to move back to her hometown for a work placement, as it’s much closer than the city we live in. Her lease was over so she’s fully situated there until she finishes her work placement in the summer. It’s not terrible though, just maybe an hour if traffic is good. 

That said, I’m headed back to my hometown for a little while as the family business suffered a setback and my parents would like some help for a bit, and my hometown is a little far. Thankfully my job will allow me to work from home during that time, but I’m going to be so busy I won’t be able to live in my usual place for around 3 weeks to a month once I head back to my parents’. This will increase the distance by around 2 hours or more, which won’t be too much of an issue, but it’ll mean that if I want to spend time with my girlfriend, she’ll likely have to stay at my parent’s house. 

I’m fine with this, and I know my parents will be happy to have her, they’re very nice and welcoming. My main concern is that I’ve scared two girlfriends in the past off with rushing meeting the parents. I would hate to pressure her or make her feel like things are moving too fast, but I also feel that this early in the relationship such a long time without seeing each other could be very detrimental. 

Anyway, I realize that this will be make or break, because I don’t think just not seeing each other is an option, and I really don’t think I’ll have the time to be heading out to meet her halfway, so it has to happen, I’m just very nervous cause I really like this girl and think things are going super well. 

Thanks for listening!",30Oct2019,2
22,My best friend plans to take her own life by overdosing on Friday and I have until then to talk them out of it. I’ve called hotlines and her parents know but I’m terrified. I don’t have enough time it’s 2 days left I’m scared and crying. I’ve tried everything I can think of to talk her out of it she’s not listening to me. I don’t knoe what I’ll do without her I’m running out of time and I’m really really scared,30Oct2019,2
24,"The fun times.. the little details.. particular words that once warmed my heart are now slowly fading. Everything will be left there where it happened. Life will move on and there will be so many months and years gone by that I wont remember how it felt to be there and then at that exact moment as life had it. 


My last hour in that place, as I thought about everything we did, I listened to William Basinski - Disintegration loops 1.1. Just like those tape loops which with time got progressively corrupted and were rendered to their barebone sounds that merely resembled the ghost of the colorful sounds they once were..... so will everything I felt. 



By the end, I'll only hear a faint echo of genuine laughs that were once in the air near the foutain. I'll hear Canon in D play faintly from a distance. I'll listen to a question that I cannot hear anymore. The details of which were once important to me because I wanted to know what you think. But no matter how far I reach to recall those details, we just had to many to remember. And now.. with those details lost... so is my knowledge of you.. your feelings and everything else. I'll hear Bojack as a mumble in the background as we stop the show every second just so we can make a joke or express our opinions.. Anyway, I have a lot to write but I wont. We had the chances and it felt that every choice we made led to the wrong multiverse of possible continuations. Little butterfly effects of wrongdoings that seemed to heavy compiled together. Ultimately, I'm okay with all of these happening. Not because I'd be okay with it.. but because noone is supposed to fight time. As memories are lost, you get to make new ones to replace and cherish the old one... and as unfortunate as it is, you wont be there for the new ones. 


But it's okay. I hope you get to be happy and create memories more mellow than the ones of the summer nights. I'm very certain I will and you will too if not already.. or maybe the summer nights weren't all that mellow to begin with. Life is good. And I'm listening to disintegration loops 1.1 as I'm writing this too. The tape is almost over, it's meandering to giving up yet it fights quite heavily. Idk.. And I'm drunk.. otherwise i'd never write this.

I feel like I always have to be doing something, so I frequent the beach, various malls, I get high all the time, I need something. I have no money though. I’m in a relationship but for some reason I’m unsatisfied. i love sex and he doesn’t. I need it, I crave it, it’s my only dopamine release so i feel like i have to get off 2, 3, 4 times a day.

28,"We didn’t date for very long, about 3 months. We also didn’t do very much together we hung out a few times and it wasn’t anything special, but to me she was a special person and I really really liked her, and she made me super happy, I felt a type of joy I’ve never felt before, and the first time in my life I was content with myself and who I was. Then, about 3 months in as soon as our relationship got actually serious she ended it. She ended it, didn’t talk to me, didn’t want anything to do with me, and it really hurt me because I liked her so much, and it was almost like she was ripped away from me. I’ve tried to get over her and I thought I was doing really good, but I realized I’m not, ever since she broke up with me and stopped talking to me period, I haven’t really been myself. I haven’t been happy, I haven’t felt joy, I feel like I’m just there, as if I’m just floating in the wind, I don’t feel any emotion I’m just there. I’ve started to really wonder about my self worth sometimes. I’ve tried to bring myself forward and get over her, but I just can’t.

But now that I am not in school anymore, it seems everyone in public have smooth, shaved legs and I feel terrible about mine. It’s not super coarse or anything but I think it’s still noticeable. I am just afraid, I guess, that people would think of me as lazy or improper.

32,"I 21M can be very self-conscious about myself. Honestly it’s hard for me to imagine a girl ever being attracted to me. I have too many dealbreakers.

For starters, I’ve been balding since 18. I feel like the vast majority of girls my age don’t like bald guys. Let’s say I get extremely lucky and find a girl who doesn’t care. Then she finds out I have a 4 inch penis. What are the odds she doesn’t care about that AND my bald head. Let’s say I get unfathomably lucky and say she doesn’t care. What are the odds that she will stick around knowing I’m a virgin who never learned how to he good at oral or fingering? I feel like it is just too unlikely to find a girl (my age especially) who doesn’t care about balding AND a small penis AND virginity. I should also mention I’m also fat which is probably another dealbreaker, but that is the one thing I can change.

It just seems like I am a lost cause. I can’t even take comfort in calling these girls shallow because people are allowed preferences. The problem is me and there is nothing I can do to fix it. The likelihood of me finding a girl who overlooks these major dealbreakers is too small",30Oct2019,1
33,"When you're an attractive or average woman, you receive unwanted, creepy male attention through catcalling. 

When you're an unattractive woman, you get a few guys who are obsessed with you. They cling to you because they believe that no other woman would give them the time of day.  They have a low self esteem, so they won't go for an average or ""higher quality"" woman, believing it wouldn't work for them. They have an idealized image of the homely girl with a good personality and pure heart in their heads, so they won't move on. Receiving unwanted, creepy attention from this type of guy is the equivalent of catcalling for women who are too unattractive to be catcalled.

This is my own take based on my personal experiences. Could be wrong.",30Oct2019,4
34,"Last night, my life fell into place, and I can picture the exact moment when. 

—

It’s when he took my face in his hands, and pulled my face up to meet his gaze... I knew. He chose. And it was finally me. After everything we put each other through, trying to hate each other, the things we said to justify the misplaced anger. I remember his eyes, as he stared into mine and he apologized over and over. And he told me that he shouldn’t have run. He didn’t know what he was feeling. That he had never felt like this before, and that what he thought was love really was nothing close. That he was so scared because everything was so intense, so fast; right from the start. 

The intense need to be around one another, the feeling of freedom in not having to hide from each other, any thing. I knew him already, like he knew me. I could tell that he knew every part of me, and I had only laid eyes on him while he was walking through the doors of my apartment building, snow flying in the wind behind him. 


I think I nearly died of happiness in that moment, and oh, the thought of that feeling... of his forehead touching mine, tilting my face upwards into his, just standing there. Feeling him radiate love again, like fire. Loving me and meaning it. Something I missed. Him asking for forgiveness and at the same time asking for me to be his again. Promising me that he would never hurt me again. Because, he was right, I was his and will always be, his. In the same way that he is mine. We always felt it; from the first time he kissed me, standing in my living room on the first night we met. When our teeth lightly knocked together and he made a joke about it - I felt it. The recognition, the feeling of wholeness.  The feeling of being reunited with something that you loved but didn’t know that you were missing. 

It is extremely terrifying to admit that there is someone that makes you feel such a way... it feels wonderful and frightening, and it gives me such an anxiety, but in a good way, in a way I can’t even begin to explain. It sends shivers down to the base of my spine, and brings a subtle, stupid smile to my face. 

But on the other side, I’m also scared to death of him, I’m scared that he will pull away again. That he will decide that he doesn’t know what to do with how he is feeling, or how I show him I care, and when I simply just need to touch him. 

All I think about the pain I felt when he told me that he couldn’t, that he didn’t want to be with me, to be friends, to make plans. That he was meant to be alone, when he wasn’t. When he said that he was just too broken and too damaged from everyone else in his past, to love me because he didn’t know if he could love... It felt like salt being rubbed in a wound that covered my entire body. It felt like a hundred thousand tiny pins being dug into my skin. It was uncomfortable, it was nauseating, it made my stomach drop into the pit of my stomach and twist into a million fraying knots. 

In that moment, I felt my entire heart break and shatter like glass. I’ve never felt something that had no psychical form, hurt me so deeply, so profoundly. And I, unable to do absolutely anything to stop the ache.  My eyes rained tears, I could not control the sobs that were coming up from my chest and leaving my mouth. I could not control how my shoulders fell and let my head dip onto my knees, lifeless, as I wrapped my arms around my legs and just wept. 

How I fell asleep with tears still dripping from my eyes. When I woke up with my pillow wet, and my face still damp and blotchy with tears. And yet, I could not think of anything but him and how I absolutely, unequivocally, needed him. Period. I needed HIM to be with me. And if I couldn’t have him as my lover, than it was meant to be as something else. A partner? 

As I sat in a bath filled with hot water, knees up to my chest, smoking bowl after bowl from my bong, begging someone or something for clarity, I  think. I decided that I would wait. Even if that meant forever.  For as long as it took for him to realize that I was his, and that I always had been. In whatever capacity he needed me to be, whatever role he needed me to play in his life- I was willing. Just so I could hear his voice, see him smile, make him laugh and feel his eyes upon me. I was willing to see him choose what he would think was happiness with someone else. I was willing to support any decision, and any idea he had. That sacrifice? That is love. Something that can feel so right, and leave you so empty. 

I did not want to lose him, not after I had spent so long searching.",30Oct2019,3

In the last 3/4 years I've been helping with 13/14yo writing exams by reading and scribing for them. Otherwise no tests.

I'm the youngest in the group (23) and just annoys me that that's what they expect but you do not do that 5 minutes before sitting to write. 

Our main lady/mentor saw my reaction and after like 4 minutes of freezing freak out, she calmed me down with ""we've taught you more than you've needed to know"" and ""I saw your practice answers, your answers are good and you'll be fine"" no pressure from her just proper reassurance.

44,"I’m not from money. My parents don’t pay for my school. Most of my payment is in loans and I have VERY limited contact with my parents because of the horrible abuse they put me through until I moved out at 20. Some R/raisedbynarcissists level of bs. 

I finally made it into a nursing school. I’m first semester and taking pathophysiology. The professor I got would not lecture well and get off topic, not tell you what chapters would be on the test until maybe two days before if you ask a lot, not post powerpoints, not give instructions for assignments due, change dates for tests and quizzes dramatically within a weeks notice (moving one test up three weeks six days before the new test date and still not knowing what would be on it). There’s more especially parts about blaming the student for being lazy. 

I fill out a formal complaint. 

I drop the class one week later because I haven’t learned much and what I have had been self taught but not the right material for the test. I can’t get an F. 

The dean requests a meeting over my complaints. Continues to berate me for the topics I chose to complain about. Criticizes my working less than 20 hours a week and being stressed about school. Tells me I’m overly worried about taking three very hard clases next semester because of this hickup. (The three are called the triangle of death by other students and I was trying to avoid that by taking one of them this semester). He finishes the meeting with threatening me with silence and strongly implying bad things would happen if I told anyone about this meeting. 

Two weeks after I drop he is removed from teaching the coarse for incompetency. All the students schedules are rearranged and they are placed in a new class nine weeks into the semester with a new professor who lectures and test differently to cover the remaining material. I am offered to return to the class. This is a hell no. That’s not fair and we would be tested over material that wasn’t taught three days after this all happened. 

I meet with two advisors about getting a refund because I learn I may have to pay $1500 before next semester for the class. (Who knows though because my financial aid advisor doesn’t know until late November?) Both advisors tell me it is very unlikely and pretty much it won’t happen. One is sympathetic and the other says they did their part by offering me to come Back into the class. 

I email the dean and ask for a refund and possibly the W off of my transcript because of the extreme and unusual circumstances of this class. His reply is basically a hell no lol. 

I learn the next week that one of the other students dropped and got a full refund administered by an advisor I talked a lot to. (She comes from a very wealthy family and I feel that is part of why this happened). 

I plan to go to the president of the school and complain but I don’t know if I have the emotional stability for this shit. I feel like breaking down every time I talk to someone which makes me look crazy. I’m having heart palpitations related to anxiety and am VERY suicidal atm.

46,"So, first disclaimer, this was a private music teacher that I fucked years later as an adult, not while I was his student.

But I first met him when I was 15.

I took lessons from him for 4 years before I moved away and started going to school. He was so important to me, he helped me find my self confidence and my love of music. I came from a very emotionally unavailable home, and he was there for me in a way that no other adult had ever been before.

When I moved home again at the age of 22, we started dating. He was 10+ years older than me.

At first, it was awesome. I had had a crush on him for years and it was so totally vindicating to know he was having feelings for me now as an adult. 

The sex was mindblowing. But every time we did it, I fell more in love with him. He didn't feel the same way.

But what I didn't realize was that even though it had been a few years since he had been my teacher, I still felt about him the same way I did when I was 15. He told me that he cared about me, but that he wasn't ready to commit.

I asked him multiple times, but he would just tell me that he wasn't ready and I would vow to wait until he was.

All at once, I began to have this horrible realization that I was dating an asshole. That the man who had been my role model was sharing a body with the man who was also a selfish jerk. 

I felt like if I could only steer our ""relationship"" into more stable waters, then I could redeem the man in the present and save the man in my memories.

I waited 8 months before I finally told him it was over.

But I still can't stop thinking about him, and now all of my innocent teenage memories of him are ruined. And the parts of me that he helped influence feel ruined too.

He is beautiful. I had thought i would never call a man beautiful till the day i knew him. Not only is he beautiful with his blond hair and pale blue eyes, he has a beautiful soul. One that is caring towards humans and animals alike. He won't hesitate helping others. I still retain the vivid image of him lying on the floor playing with out cat or how he came home one day with a puppy to surprise me.
He loves me and cherishes me like no one else ever did. He would video call me in the middle of the night and we talk till the sun's up. We would sneak out and see each other between breaks. I love our midnight walks and cycles. All the kisses and touches and whispers in my ears. He would always lend me shoulder to cry on on my bad days. Then when I'm done crying, we would watch a movie together on his sofa and I'm wrapped in his dusty old blanket. His love is inexhaustible. 
I miss him, alot. I miss his scent of sweet cologne, the human smell of his skin and cigarettes. I miss the sight of his back while he's cooking dinner. I miss the way his strong big hand wrapped around mine. I miss the way the back of his hair curled up on a damp summer day. I miss his calm soft voice and way he drags out the ""urghh"" in his speech. I miss his stupid jokes and ugly faces. I miss his beautiful, innocent, child-like smiles. I miss his everything. And over all, I miss us together. 
Yet, even when he's gone, he never fails to put a smile on my face whenever I think of him. I want him to know that he's always on my thoughts and I still love him like I've done ever before.

50,"Some context: I'm in my mid-20s, I'm female, I'm the oldest of two children and have a younger brother. I grew up with my mum and dad, who split when I was 20. 

Over the last few years, I've come to realise that a lot of my personal issues (anxiety, over compensating in relationships for fear that my partner will leave, and being worried about what others think, etc) have stemmed from my mother and some of the things that she did to me. I'm not blaming my mum for everything, she had a rough child hood herself and I don't believe that her actions were necessarily malicious, but I think that it's important for me to acknowledge that some of my issues certainly are connected to her and that's important for me to know so that I can grow as a person. 

Growing up, I didn't have a lot of friends. My mum would say that it isn't true and that it didn't happen, but *I* remember being guilted by my mum for hanging out with certain girls because my mum didn't like their parents. I was 6. Why would you say anything like that to your child? These weren't sketchy people either, my mum (I think) was just jealous of theae kid's mothers and didn't want me hanging around with them. 

My mum had a very straight forward approach to teaching my younger brother and I life lessons. 

When I was 13, I was getting bullied pretty badly at school. I was overweight, and I felt so worthless. Literally the only thing that I felt that I was good at was my writing. I can't remember what I did, but I remember that my mum was in her room crying and I felt like it was my fault. I remember writing her a letter saying that I was sorry and that I loved her and slipping it under her door. I remember her coming out of her room and telling me that she expects much better writing from someone 'apparently' so good at it and that she was disappointed in how I'd written it. That absolutely destroyed me and I gave up on writing completely. 

When I got my period for the first time, mum told me to never tell anyone and that it  was my secret. I got so paranoid about anyone finding my pads in the rubbish that I hid them in my closet. I know, it's gross, but I was so scared of anyone knowing that that's what I did. One day when I came home from school, I found out that mum had been through my closet and told me how disgusting it was and how I can't do that. Obviously it was gross. I just cleaned it all up, but it wasn't until later that I wondered why she went through my closet and why periods were basically a dirty secret? 

When I was 14, a girl was bullying me and my mum told me to squirt red ink on the back of her dress. I didn't, but she wanted me to. The girl was 14!? As an adult I couldn't imagine doing something like that to a young teenage girl. 

When I was 15 I was overweight and my mum forced me to wear a longer dress than the other girls. I really wanted to fit in though, so I stapled my dress shorter. When I got back from school my mum forced me to turn around and take photos of the backs of my legs and show me how disgusting they were. To the this day even at a normal weight, I struggle a lot with how the backs on my legs look. 

Going back to around 12 or so, my mum got drunk one night. My dad was at work, my brother was asleep. I woke up to hear mum ruffling around the kitchen. I walked out, saw her with a knife, and she told me that she wanted to die. She was just about to slash up her painting, but I talked her down and told her to go to bed. I hid all of the kitchen knives in my bedroom that night. 

When I was 18 I got my first boyfriend. Mum forced me to swear that I hadn't had sex yet and she forced me to go to the doctor and get prescribed birth control tablets, which she told me to stop taking a few years later because it apparently messes up your hormones and she wanted me to get pregnant. 

Anyway, there's been a lot of things. Far too many things to get into and I'm starting to get overwhelmed. I had a panic attack the other day because I accepted that my upbringing wasn't normal. How is it normal to hide knives because you think your mum is going to hurt herself?

What set all this off? Mum broke up with her partner (not my dad) who she'd been seeing for a couple of years. After they broke up, I went out of my way to help her. I hired and paid for a storage unit for her, I asked my boss (new job) if I could borrow a van to move some of her things, and I asked some friends and my boyfriend to help with moving her stuff. Mum went a bit crazy during the breakup. She drove to her ex's house, she threatened to kill herself, got taken to the police station, etc. Anyway, she told me how abusive and horrible he was to her. She told me that she hated him. She told me that he was manipulative etc, etc, and had targeted her because she was so vulnerable. 

Today, I found out that she's back with him. They went away on holidays together and when I asked her if they were back together, she said that they were just friends, but going to counselling. Yeah right. 

Anyway, a few weeks ago mum asked me for a picture of my driver's license. She needed it so that if something were to happen to her, her money would go straight to me and my brother. Spoke to my brother tonight, she never asked him for a copy of his license. What does she need my license for?

Sorry for the long post. This is such a hard thing for me to realise because I've always put my mum on a pedestal, but I'm starting to realise that she's a toxic person.",30Oct2019,10
52,"It sounds so, so pretty. Very soothing and relaxing. It's like one of those voices you can hear in an ASMR. Deep and raspy. I always joke about that and tell him to start a YouTube channel, in which he jokes back saying ”But I only want my baby girl to hear it“

I'm so in love with him ;-;",30Oct2019,3
53,"So two years ago, I caught feelings for a friend of mine who was already in a relationship. Last fall, we started getting closer, but she'd said she wasn't looking for a relationship because she was still recovering from their breakup. A bunch of other stuff happened, and she got back together with her ex. The rest of this doesn't really factor into this, other than my feelings spiking at intermittent points of the year. I came back to town this fall, and we started to talk again. Apparently, she did develop something of feelings for me too. But she never said anything. Everything we were doing the year prior felt like it was just something casual for her (I have a long and tbh rough history with promiscuity) and a way for me to vent my feelings and ultimately get them to leave. But she just said if I had said something, we would've dated. But that would've involved A) reading into what was happening and being sure I wasn't just seeing what I wanted to; B) overstep her word of not wanting a relationship when there was no indication that period had ended; and C) done everything within a 2 month span of when we started getting closer and when she got back together with her ex. All of our friends side with her that I should've said something, but I was backed into a corner. Now she's with a new guy-and he makes her happy, that's all I really need-but I need to find a time to talk to her about all of this. But I can feel her slipping away from me. She's one of my best friends at this point, and I can't lose her. At this point, although I'd rather have her as a significant other, I'm perfectly content with keeping her as a friend. I don't know how to do it though, and I don't know the new guy, and I don't know if he's the one that wants me out. I don't know what the guy's like at all, but I know he makes her happy. I just don't know if her being happy means ejecting me from her life",30Oct2019,1
54,"This is hard for me to do, but I'm tired of lurking and I want to share. 
Last night I broke up with my SO after being together for almost 7 years. I had so many reasons both good and bad but more than anything it was just time. I didn't want to hate him, I didn't want to cheat on him and completely destroy him more than I already have and even though I sometimes feel like that'd be easier I know it wouldn't be right. We had had rough patches before and gotten through them but we'd grown into separate people after such a long time. We were both young when we got together and I believe that I need to learn how to be a person apart from him. 
It just sucks. Before the breakup I was scared and sad but also a little thrilled to be single. Not because I wanted to have a ton of casual sex with people but I just wanted the freedom to make my own decisions and be responsible for my own mistakes. Now I feel nothing. I cried when I broke up with him and I cried so hard afterwards but now I don't feel like crying. I want to cry. I feel like I should cry. But it's just not there. I'm trying so hard to mourn but I keep finding myself being distracted by trivial things. 
Oh...I need to unload the dishwasher. Oh...I need to upload a paper for class. Oh...my new roommates are home so I'll go talk to them. 

Has anyone else been there? Where is the pain? Where is the collapsed on the floor sobbing and days of not showering or eating anything other than junk food? Has it just not hit me yet? Am I a monster?

Please, I don't need responses. I'm just so confused and I feel like a horrible person. I'm just tired of hiding so here's my truth, for Reddit to see.",30Oct2019,1
56,"I’m not a religious person nor do I believe in a god or spirit.

Things haven’t been going smoothly lately. I recently went through a bad breakup and I’ve been having suicidal thoughts. I have a shit ton of schoolwork that I have to do (I’m homeschooled). I possibly might’ve lost a few friends.

I cried to my mother and told her that I needed professional help, to see a therapist. She asked me if I wanted her to call my primary doctor and of course, I said yes. It’s about time for me to seek help and I’ve waited too long.

Last night, I prayed to any higher being. I prayed that I would grow, mature, and heal from all of this heartbreak. I prayed that I will mentally get better. I prayed for them to send the right person in my path, and if there isn’t anybody, I prayed that it will be me. I prayed that it will be me who finds true peace and happiness within themselves.

I don’t know who I prayed to exactly, but whoever is out there, I hope they have received my prayer. Again, I’m not religious nor do I believe in any religion. I only pray when I get completely desperate and this is one of my very desperate times.",30Oct2019,1

I snapped a new blade off my straight edge, only to realize I broke it off too short and there wasn't enough blade left for me to do anything, so I took the broken piece instead. I'm messaging my  boyfriend to try to calm down, to have some semblance of sanity, but there's blood on my screen from my fingertips I guess and that's all I can see. I don't know what I'm expecting from this, nothing I guess. I don't want to talk to people even if they message me, I tried online therapy and psychiatrists and therapists over the years and nothing seemed to help.

59,"I’ve never written anything like this before, so apologies in advance. I suppose I never really liked the idea of bringing much attention to myself. The thought of being anonymous always seemed comforting to me lately. Also, there are plenty of people who have it much, much worse than I do. This is just an attempt to share my story. That being said, here goes…


I got into quite a bit of trouble growing up. A friend of mine says that is likely to have influenced my current desire for anonymity. In any case, I was suspended frequently in middle school. Even before that, I remember in 5th grade I would play with my action figures on the sidelines while the other kids played kick-ball. I was constantly bullied and ostracized, and my home life wasn't preferable at the time either. On top of that, the school’s counselors didn’t show much interest in the students. As a result, my most common way of asking for help was to lash out. High school was fine. It was a major transition period for everyone. The vibrancy of childhood faded to create a very bleak and gray setting for maturity. People were nice enough, but it seemed to be backed by a sense of going through the motions. Like everyone had a smiley face mask over their real face.

I liked to draw though, and it would often be a safe haven for my imagination. I still like to draw, enough to major in animation. I went to three different colleges, including my current university. The first two institutions were actually the same company, let's say College A, and actually ended up closing down entirely, hence my multiple transfers. At the risk of sounding sappy, cliche, or just downright pretentious, I actually met the love of my life there. Let’s call her Rachel. I say all this because it has had massive effects on me and how I perceive myself. In any case, despite the tone this entry has, my head was held high through high school and entering university. I like to think that is what helped me meet her. I was focused on my goal in life and set on the steps on how to achieve my dream of becoming an animator and filmmaker. It didn’t take long for Rachel and I to start dating. Our relationship was great and after not too long, the relationship became serious. We often talked about marriage, despite us only being 20 each. It got to the point where I had the whole thing planned out. She had never seen the ocean, so I was going to have us take a road trip to Cape Cod, Massachusetts (a place I knew very well after spending a few summers there). I’d bring her to the beach and ask her the question on the spot. Kinda cheesy, I know, but I’m sure she would’ve loved it. We talked about children every now and then too. Rachel would often take care of her niece and nephew who were toddlers, so the thought of children wasn't too alien. Soon however, I came to realize that in order to do all these things with her and to live that life, I’d have to give up my dream. You see, my dream of pursuing animation and film was what kept me together through the hardest times in my life; the promise to myself of leaving this place behind. Rachel couldn’t leave because she was too close with her family, which I understood. Soon, a realization came to me that terrified me to the core, and that was the possibility that I could love someone or something more than my dream, which was all I knew. In a lifetime of looking forward and planning for what was next, Rachel was the first person to say “shh” and to tell me to focus on right now; to live in the moment. And that scared me, so I ended up pushing her away and ended it. 

Months later, her and I started to hang out as friends. Things seemed to be fine on the surface, and while they truly were for her, I knew I still loved her. But by that time, she was starting to see someone else, so I backed off. I had no right to intrude on her happiness. In no way am I trying to seem virtuous by saying that. In time, I knew it was my selfish actions that got us there in the first place.

After that, came Japan. I spent a semester abroad in Japan in the fall of 2017. It was both the best and worst time of my life. All of my insecurities and realizations came to a head while I was there. While there, I had a wonderful friend who helped me. We’ll call her Jade, and her and I would go for long walks through the streets of Sagamihara until 4am. I’ve never forget those streets and those lights. It was those walks, those neighborhoods and those cityscapes that truly touched my soul. It didn’t take long to realize that Jade had feelings for me. Upon returning to the US, she wrote me a letter reminiscing on our adventures. About the times we walked past the blue star ornament that dared us to adventure onward, the time we had to take shelter from the cold late light November wind in a 24 hour local laundromat, the time we passed by a local bar in the late hours of the night and see the same three elderly people who were clearly lifelong friends, the time we gazed out at the city lights while under the watchful luminessence of the moon, and many, many more. Much care was taken into it and it was beautifully written. Her feelings were perfectly clear, but I just didn’t feel the same way. She was brave to offer her heart in such a meaningful way. But how low would I have to be to accept it when my heart was lost living in the past, with someone else? So I turned her away. Since Rachel, the idea of love just has never felt right. I even tried, but I just didn’t have it in me. Sometimes I’d think I found someone, but it’d fall through very quickly. Not long after Jade, I quickly began losing friends all around. Part of it was my doing, as they were mutual friends and I knew Jade would need them. The other part was simply those who expressed that I wasn’t a good friend, which was true, as I should’ve been upfront with Jade sooner. Regardless, I still keep her letter as a reminder of better times.

I share these two events because they have shaped who I am for the past half decade. I’ve abandoned animation and filmmaking in the years since, and have been grateful to the friends who have stayed with me. However, I will be leaving them as well to return to Japan indefinitely, beginning next year.


I was hesitant to share this because I’ve seldom shared it, and never in full, to anybody, be it written or spoken. Regardless, these events have molded me in such a way that I actively choose not to return to what was before. Maybe this makes me a martyr, maybe this makes me a bad person. I accept these consequences, just as I know this will affect others perception of me. In that lies my only pursuit, not for perception but for lack thereof. To live in the moment instead of solely plan. To see the now, and to do so as a passerby. My mind often returns to Rachel, not envious or angry, but happy and sometimes sad. She is truly happy now and I’m thrilled for her. Still, I have my fair share of regrets. What I would give to tell her she is enough now, but I know I must let her go. Not only that, but I must also continue down this path that I’ve chosen. I know the correct path is to choose to have these experiences build my character and to move on, and while I can do the former, I’m afraid I can’t do the ladder. 

Where I'm at now is considering whether or not I should send Rachel something to tell her I still love her. Friends say I should, but I have my reservations. I've already told her in a way, but unfortunately was A) while I was having a depressed emotional episode so it didn't come out at all the way it should've, and also B) it was over text. I've also extended the thought of remaining friends when I was is a better place recently, and more collected. Also, a direct letter mailed to her home after all this time seems very inappropriate. On the other hand, I feel like I have nothing to lose with writing a letter, besides possibly lessening her opinion of me even more than it probably already is.


What should I do?


TL/DR: Lost the love of my life, friends, and purpose. In the process of recovering, but should I tell her I still love her?",30Oct2019,1
60,"I'm depressed, I have anxiety and social anxiety and I don't enjoy my life. I don't know what being a friend with someone means anymore. Everyone I've been friend with has dumped me. At the beginning they pretend that they care about me, but after few months they just ditch me like an unneeded piecie of garbage. I start to cate about someone very quickly, I'm vulnerable. But I won't continue with this. I won't ever make a new friend. I won't start caring about somebody. I won't ever fall in love again. These things just make me weak and I don't want to be hurt anymore. I won't let others to hurt me that easily. Few days ago I started having feelings towards one person. But I will get rid of them. The process may not be very pleasant, but at the end I will be stronger.",30Oct2019,1
61,"Well. Title really says it all. So I’ve met this guy a couple times on random occasions (mutual friends) .. by the looks of his snapchat stories I never once got the “in a relationship” impression, let alone married. His Snapchat stories are consistently random girls/at clubs/etc. (I’m assuming his extra Snapchat account his wife probably knows nothing about) 

One day he asked me if I was aware of his “situation” which I replied...no, what? He was straight up told me he was married and said we could see each other as long as I kept it quiet. I said no way, that I’m not into destroying/disrespecting people’s relationships and that if I knew he was married I would’ve never been attempting to see him or whatever. 

Fast forward a couple weeks later, after a long day of drinking, (like a dumb bitch) I caved and let it happen. 

Prior to it happened we had a somewhat serious talk (idk how serious you’d consider it with me drunk and him sober), but in other words he basically said they’ve been together before he graduated college and things aren’t what they used to be (of course that’s what they all say). 

I was unaware who this guy ACTUALLY was. After doing a simple google search, turns out he’s a very successful business owner in the city I live in, I’m talking multi millionaire—so I’m assuming he has many girls flocking to him for that reason. I personally could not give a shit how much money a guy has, I literally just thought he was attractive (I hate how I sound rn believe me) 

Looking back my drunk stupid bitch logic was “if he does what he wants anyway..what does it matter” Drunk me and sober me are two very different people just to clarify. 

As guilty as I feel, I definitely was not the first one and I’m sure I will not be the last. 

I have now come to learn he has children as well. Not grown, toddlers. And a wife who seems to love him very much according to her Facebook page (wasn’t hard to find, they are apparently well known around here). 

I’m ashamed tbh.. one, that I allowed myself to be apart of his shittyness and second that he goes home everyday to a wife that is clueless. 

So I had to just get that off my chest. Feel free to rip me up I honestly deserve it

Warning: Long.

I am writing here to update all those people that were so nice and supported me to go for it in the original thread. I'm sad to say that I do not have good news for you. I will give a summary of what happened during this month. Unfortunately, I felt that I was fighting a lost war.

So after the last thread, I vowed to continue communication, and she seemed she wanted to as well. We talked periodically during the day, and we exchanged good mornings. Problems started soon after. The quoted text is real text from the chats.

Once, on a Sunday, I sent her a good morning as soon as I woke up. Being a bit sleepy, I sent ""Gm"" as a text. I got chewed out like hell. She said: ""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Really? Gm? Good morning is good morning"". 

&amp;#x200B;

When I told her that I was still sleepy and I sent it because I thought about her first thing in the morning, she said:

&gt;Im sorry, you can write a bit later, when you are ready to write the whole words. It is not obligated to send it asap

I was weirded out, and later that evening I tried to reason with her. She wouldn't listen. She blamed it on me and was a bit cold for a few days, but we kept contact. 

A week later, it was her birthday. I sent her a message early before she woke up, so that she could find the message first thing in the morning. I wanted to express affection to her, she saw it and seemed to like it. Good. Later that day I asked her if she wanted me to call her on her bday, she said yes, so being her bday and not wanting to disturb her, I asked her to tell me when is the best time to call her. She said ok, but as the day went on, she never messaged. I was a bit sad to not hear her voice, but since it was her day I thought she was very busy and let her be.  

The weekend approached and Friday night she was excited because her family was visiting. She mentioned her sister's husband left the shower setting on a wrong setting and she got showered by mistake. I laughed and reminded her I did the same thing when I visited her. She saw it, and didn't reply. Saturday came, and she didn't say anything. I was confused and wanted to talk to her, but I let her be in case she wanted to enjoy her family. 

Sunday came and when I woke up I found a good morning from her, like nothing has happened. The day goes on normally, and I told her in case she needed to hear it, that I am ready to work for this, even if there is a big distance. I told her:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In case you need to hear it, I am ready to work for this thing, even if it is very hard.

&amp;#x200B;

She said:

&gt;Thank you, it is good to know it. It is hard to talk about it when we are so far from each other.

&amp;#x200B;

A bit happier, we went on talking for the next few days. While at work, I noticed that I have a lot of off days I didn't take, so I thought about going to Lithuania for a week in December to see her. I spoke to her, she seemed in a good mood and told me that she would love to, but she cannot promise as December is a very busy time for them ( she worked retail). She said maybe if I gave her the days early she can fix something. She went to shower, I researched about which days would be best, and when she came back I asked what does she think about the days I found. She got a bit defensive, and said that she cannot promise right now. She said that probably it won't happen.  I said:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I knew it was difficult. But I told you I am ready to work for it and I tried 

&amp;#x200B;

Her reply stunned me. 

&gt;For you its easier to work for it. Sometimes you say, you understand, but i see that you dont. You  have your \[amount\] k salary. And i have other problems. I try to solve them and i cant really think about holidays for now. Im sorry if it doent suit to your expectations 

&amp;#x200B;

So here I am trying my best for this girl, and she just said its easy for me. I said:  


&gt; I don't think you are being fair to me now, \[Name\].I have my own problems and you do not know them.I am aware of your difficulties, and I knew it was going to be difficult. I am trying my best to make this work.""Easier"" would be to find another girl. That is easy. But I don't want to find another girl because the girl i like lives in Lithuania.What more can I do? 

&amp;#x200B;

She said I could be more patient. I was at a loss on what to say, really. I ignored it for a day, but then a day later I could take it no more. I was having a coffee and speaking with her in the morning. I had heard the plane for Lithuania leaving that morning, and it made me sad. I told her maybe some day, she replied wow that's not very positive \*rolls eyes\*. 

Honestly I saw red. I told her:  


&gt; It all depends on you. “It is easy for me to try hard” and I “do not understand your situation” anyway.  So why waste my time wishing for something that is difficult to happen? 

&amp;#x200B;

She said I don't understand her situation again, to which the chat followed:  


&gt;**Her**: Oh, wow Do you think, you understand?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me**: I know you do not have it easy.And I am not expecting that you drop your life for me. But, last time you turned your argument on me, and I do not think I was treated fairly. I know you are busy, have responsibilities, have problems. And that those come first.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Her**: Its not about responsibilies, its about lifeDaily life  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me**:Yes of course.I did not expect you to say yes for december and I am ok with it.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Her**: Do you think you understand how i live?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me**: I know you do not have it easy. I know it was sacrifice to even have me there.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Her**: I dont think, that you understand how ""not easy"" it is  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me**: But you think you only have problems? You think that I don’t? Because you painted me like I live a care free life.My family is broken and I have to take care a lot of things.That is one small thing of the many you do not know.I hope you understand that I am not angry or arguing with you. All I want is to see you again when the time is right.   


&amp;#x200B;

After that, she left me on seen for a week. I was sure that that was it. I 'll be honest, I grieved a bit for her loss. And started to move on. Suddenly,last Thursday, while I was in Italy, she wrote me:  


&gt;**Her**: Leaving lithuania in two days .I hope, you understand now, what i was talking about  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me**: I wish you all the best, honestly. To where?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Her**: Germany. It happend so fast, on tuesday they informed me and on saturday im leaving And on monday i am at new work  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me**: I am sure you will do well. But if you do not communicate with me, how should have I known?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Her**: Dont start it.Ive got the mood to talk and you are taking away again  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me**: There are many things i want to say  
&gt;  
&gt;**Her**: So say it  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me**: All i will say for now is that I miss you. Even if probably that doesn’t mean anything to you.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Her**: You know, im going to leave my home under the lock.. Empty. Don't say, that i dont care, Its just a time, when i dont know nothing, and i dont want to have that responsibility to plan something  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me**: I understand that.I do not understand how you can reply to “ I miss you” with “ i will leave my house empty”. Wow.I am in Italy and I am a guest with an elderly couple. Just because for once in a month you want to talk, I cannot do it right now.If you want to talk, let’s schedule a call, whenever you want , and we talk like adults, NOT CHILDREN. I hope I will hear your voice soon, \[Name\].  
&gt;  
&gt;**Her**: No need big letters .I wish you nice time  
 

That was the last I heard from her.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday was my birthday. I received many messages, but I was waiting for one from her. it never came. I feel very sad about it and I miss her. But I think I have done more than enough, and I will not support her abusive behavior anymore. If I say something she doesn't like, she withdraws for days, while she can say whatever she want. I cannot understand why she acts like this. Its like she wants to reach out but doesn't know how. But I am no one's therapist.

It is time to let it go. I do not know what to do if she ever speaks again. I think the best thing is to treat her like it really was; an adventure to a foreign country. One which I enjoyed and I will treasure forever. As for her, the person I had come to like, probably does not exist in real life.",30Oct2019,9

68,"You know, I think everyone is equal, because we're all made from the same stardust, originating from the same big bang. Each of us is sacred, a manifestation of the universe. I'm in a good place, though I'm writing from a psychiatric ward (for schizophrenia), and I was a virgin until 27 (I'm 30). I didn't even had a single girlfriend in my life to hold by the hand romantically, just 3 sexual relationships, so I had a tough life, and I suffered most of it, but now I feel invincible. I am so strong, and I fear nothing.  
  
Even my work life is a mess, I didn't work officially yet and I am a little more than half into a bachelor (computer science). I chose computer science because I was a full blown hermit, a true loner, and I couldn't imagine myself in a social environment, so I wanted to be a doctor, to help people, but I went for computer science (which is great and fascinating also, I do love it, so I'm not complaining).  
  
I'm sorry if you think I'm whining, but I'm just showing you that we can have what is objectively a bad, rough life, and still enjoying it all and overgrowing it. I know what I want to be, I want to learn Chinese, to make electronic music, and learn all of the world history, and to become a world expert in Artificial intelligence. I'm excited by these challenges. I know a lot of practical knowledge, like Photoshop or a little electronics or what have you, and I can take on anything. Everything is in reach, and I know that it is in your reach also, if you just believe in yourself.  
  
I never met someone stupid, I'm always surprised. I love everyone, and everyone loves me. This is amazing. You just have to fight for virtue, fight against bitterness, against the feeling of injustice, just blow through all that shit, and strongly stand up and believe that it is for the best, and then it becomes for the best. Never stop fighting for virtue. You know, I have dabbled in evil in my words, I was very bitter and misanthropic once, so I'm far from perfect, but I have corrected myself, and now I just want to spread the goodness, and share a bit of my strength. I regret everything evil that I did, and I keep it to a minimum, as you should. (Tasting a little evil is okay for the experience, but this is very dangerous and damaging, later on.) 
  
Also, I dream to be a leader. I see everyone is scared from existence, mostly. I can feel this is one of the essential problems. I know existential dread, I have tasted it, and I have bested it. The universe is not scary, it is an exciting adventure. Imagine how scary it would be if only goodness existed, then it means it wouldn't be free, it would be constrained, we would live in a psychological choke-hold, and I think even it would make it meaningless, it would lose its value. We need the freedom of evil, and we will best it, as we have bested Hitler. The world is full of good, and what people see as evil is mostly people fighting for their family, I believe, and trying very hard to be loved.  
  
Yes, this is what I see everywhere: people trying very hard to be loved. They dress the best, they behave the best, not because they enjoy it for the sake of it, but because they want to be loved, so very hard. Life is not easy yes, and we are all winging it, and we are all injured, and we all deserve to be loved to be so courageous, so human. Everyone is amazing. I don't like it when people say that we need ""bad people"" for the ""good people"" to stand out. I don't believe there are bad people, there are just people who suffered injustice, inequality, and that are fighting just as much as the good people.  
  
You're free to disagree, but I just see beauty and value everywhere and in everyone, so I think I am in a better position to enjoy existence. This is a powerful belief, like Faith. I'm agnostic, but you know that Faith gives a lot of strength also, and I think even prayer is great because it brings humility. I used to hate religion, so I've been among the cool kids, if I can say so, but now I am forced to see the value in it, and just let it be. Mostly, it keeps evil in check, strongly. But enough about religion!  
  
I prefer nihilism. Standing up from nothing, being stronger than everything, and just thrusting your value from all your strength, into the void of the stars. This can only be beautiful. Yeah, we're already a great success. I'm sorry to say, but my bitterness days are over. Truly I read Reddit, and I can't tell if someone is a man or a woman, a kid or an old soul, everyone just seems equal, bringing his share into the debate. How can you hate that? How can you be disappointed? You know, when I was younger, I was disappointed, but I was wrong. I just suffered too much coincidental injustice, and I had to give it back. If you look closely, you can only be satisfied.  
  
Anyway, this is very long, and I'll keep it at that for now. I'm not perfect, if you check my comments you'll see I've been a retard a great many times, but I won't hide it, because yes I'm not perfect. I show you my best, but I'm full of weakness. I don't mind that. It's allowed to be a retard a great many times, as long as we tend to be good. The universe is lenient, it is merciful. You can be a great retard, and still keep at it, and do something great eventually. Just keep at it, and believe in yourself. You're as sacred as the sun.  

I won't check the replies because I'm still very shy, but I hope I was helpful, and I'll keep working at being helpful, because this is what my mother taught me. ^^

I’m not really sure where to start as this story (my upbringing) is so complicated and so much has happened but I’ll try my best to shorten it. I appreciate you for reading this and I would really appreciate some words of advice, experience or just hope right now. 

I’m 26f - passionate about writing, meditation and a gentle spirit. I’m also the daughter of a alcoholic who is trying to ruin my entire life and kill me. 

I grew up with my mum until the age of 5, my house was a crackhouse and was the base for the local drug dealers in the area. I spent the first 5 years of my life living amongst overdoses and addicts. I remember my house being raided and the police taking me away into care. I returned to my mum 4 foster homes later at age 9. 

She was “clean” to them but I soon found out she wasn’t really. When I returned she started taking drugs again heavily, I have vivid memories of sitting in crack houses with her watching people light up spoons. Seeing people turn blue, being locked in rooms and watching the Bonfire Night fireworks alone from the upstairs window of a drug den. Fast forward a few years and she started drinking heavily which meant the energy of my house changed for the worse once again.

She swapped one vice for another.

School was hell, I was and still am a bright person but trying to concentrate and excel with a home life like mine was near impossible some days. I would go into school knowing I’d have to search the local area after classes ended to find her as she would leave me sitting outside the house on the floor for hours on end. I knew I’d be going home to no food most nights (I wouldn’t starve but I’ve never had a family meal or a full fridge often growing up). I’d be going home to a drunk who would tear into me for hours or she would just disappear for a few nights. 

When she was home she was abusive emotionally and verbally, full of rage. Keeping me up all night, or leaving me to fend for myself. It was hard. 

I struggled through college and dropped out of uni in my third year as I felt I was on the edge of a mental breakdown. I met an abusive partner who would beat me up any chance he could - that lasted 3 years and tbh I stayed as I felt worthless. I left him after 3 years and the last black eye and vowed to fight for myself. I spent a few years (3) in therapy and life ticked on (I work in radio now) which brings me to where I currently am in my life. 

I’m 26 and I’m still here in the same house that has drained me from the moment I returned from care, that little girl scared and abused is now a woman in society’s eyes and I’m really really struggling. I know people must think I’m a failure, 26 living at home. I’m not active on social media much anymore as I find it all so draining when my real world is so turbulent. I need to get out of this house and have my own space before I end up giving up and joining my mother on her path of self destruction but how do I do it? I love her but it’s a toxic love, a love that addiction has tainted and a love that will kill me if I stick around. I’m sad for all the achievements I could have made, the uni course I should have finished. The woman I want to be. 

I work but my job is freelance and not that many hours and rent in London is high, I simply can’t afford to leave right now :( Every time I try to work more or do something to positively change my life and my self she ramps up her abuse. Drinking to the point of oblivion, passing out on the kitchen or living room floor and screaming at me for hours until the sun comes up. I go to work on 2 hours sleep some nights. I’m watching her kill herself, she looks so weak and at times terrifying. Seeing the look in her eyes as she downs vodka every other night kills me.

Her energy kills me, I am a strong believer in the spiritual (universe, law of attraction) and I do my best to remain positive, to remind myself I am loved even if I’ve never had a proper mother. But how can I find the strength to take back my life? How can i live for me for once? 

Has anyone  done this before? Made it through the fire so to speak? Practically not just emotionally. Because if so please help me and tell me it’s possible as right now I’m surrounded by flames and I want to make it out! 

The thing that keeps me going is the fact I want my own life, kids and family. I want a home full of love and I want to feel proud of myself. If also like to help others who have been through situations like this. I’m ashamed that at 26 I’m still living here and I know people judge me for it as they assume I’m lazy but they have no idea how hard this all is to handle.

Trying to make something of yourself is hard enough, I feel so lost somedays it takes all my strength to get out of bed but I do. I go to work, I get on with things but I’m not thriving -  I’m still here, I’m just surviving. I don’t earn enough to rent anywhere and I could get more hours somewhere I guess but I feel so drained I find it hard to maintain for long. I am willing to try again though as things are becoming really bad and I am desperate now for change. I feel like it I don’t fight for my future now and next year there won’t be much of one left. 

I have a partner who I love very much and plan to marry. He sees how much this is hurting me and yesterday he told me he can’t be around my mother anymore, he won’t come to my house or speak with her. It’s understandable as she gets drunk and starts screaming abuse about me to him through the bedroom door. He said he can’t bare to see me being hurt like this anymore, she can’t bare to see me happy.

He said if he comes over and is nice to her when sober he is condoning her actions when drunk.

I understand his feelings but it’s hit me now that everyone moves on. Her energy ends up engulfing everything around her and killing it. I don’t want her to kill me, I’m desperate to get out of here and attempt to live my OWN LIFE.

I’m posting as I’m at a place now where it feels like life or death for me - for my future - my mental health - my soul. I’m sorry to sound so dramatic but this is how I feel 

If you’ve read this far thank you. I want 2020 to be the year I break these bonds even if at 26 I already fear it’s too late somedays.

If you’ve made it through the fire please let me know, I could do with some reassurance right now and some light because this is so hard and I’m just trying to find peace.


I will find peace.
Thanks x",30Oct2019,43

76,"The reason that I am making this is just that I am just so frustrated due to my friends/classmates being such close-minded people. I myself admit that I can't afford the new games nowadays unless they I either buy them with my own savings (which might take some time) or buy a pre-owned one. I just don't have the money to immediately buy it at full price. My friends on the other hand play on PS4 and whenever a new game releases that they want, they immediately buy it without a hassle because well they're rich and that's the reality of it. I also own a PS4 but the reason I bought one is because I just wanted to play the exclusives such as GoW and Spider-man but other than that, I would rather have it on PC since playing it online is free so I only have to pay for it once.  


I recently suggested that to them that for Call of Duty: MW, I would rather play on PC since it's free and it apparently has cross-play but my friends just fucking went ham on me saying that ""I cannot afford it because I am poor"" or ""Console Master Race just join us lolz"" ""throw away your PS4 if you're not gonna use it"" and some other shit. Moreover, the borderlands 3 crack just came out recently but I don't want to support EGS so I opted to pirate it instead but as soon as I asked my friend if he wanted to play too, \[this\]([https://imgur.com/a/hPL0ref](https://imgur.com/a/hPL0ref)) is what he said as he or they see pirating games as a sin and people who does that should be condemned and I agree that it is bad but that's not the case in this situation.  


I love gaming and I believe that people SHOULD buy games that deserves it in order to support the developers but I get it, some people just doesn't have the budget in order to buy that game that they want so they resort to pirating which is a shame, I am also guilty of that but of course if I really get the chance to buy that game, I would buy in a heartbeat especially that the winter sale for Steam is just around the corner.

I had a girlfriend that I met online on a shitposting group. We talked for 4 months and became official for 8 months, during that 8 months it was mostly lovey-dovey for the first four but right after we just fought day by day. 

We fought because I played video games too much and she also gets incredibly jealous evem though I am not doing anything that can justify her of being so. I told her that we should cool-off until we become better and she also agreed. 

This past few weeks, she has been changing into a good person and so am I, but she is also becoming more distant and cold to me to the point that she doesn't even reply a proper sentence to me. Then I saw her story a selfie with her friends and a guy, she told me that this guy asked her out. I didn't want to look desperate so I told her it is up to her if she wants to accept. She said to me that she didn't and she needs advice, so I said to her to ask on reddit. She did post an advice and she just mentioned that she didn't accept because she wasn't ready yet, not because she has a boyfriend or so.

92,"Why is it so bad? This is hard for me to post, but I’m struggling, and trying to reason through things. 

This isn’t meant to be anything other than me working through the thoughts in my head about my own experiences with sexual assault, as a kid, a teenager, and an adult. It is not an excuse for people to sexually assault anyone, nor is it meant to minimize what people go through when assaulted. It’s also going to focus on man on woman assault, because that’s my experience, but other versions are just as valid. This is gonna make A LOT of assumptions because I’m working through my own biases. 

Why is sexual assault considered so bad compared to other assaults or even murder? What makes the sexual aspect so much worse?

I think it’s because we as a society have perverted the value of sex so much. 

A woman’s value for so long, and even still, is intrinsically tied to how people view her sexually- how attractive she is, how hard to get with she is, how “pure” she is. Women are “supposed” to be virgins until married, even though that idea is slowly fading, yet if her body count is too high, she’s considered damaged goods and should be ashamed. And having that body count ticked even higher by sexual assault means that she loses a bit more of that purity than she had before. 

When a man rapes a woman, we still view it through the lens of what did she do to deserve it. What was she wearing. How drunk was she. Did she volunteer to be alone with him. Well why wouldn’t he assume she was okay with it? Why? Because for so long and even in some ways still, women were meant to serve men. We’re meant to find a way to please them, placate them, sacrifice our happiness because we don’t want to make them angry. And a man’s value is viewed sexually as having a higher body count- the more partners the better. He’s more manly if he’s been with more women, but their value is diminished each time. Men want that power, that strength that says they can be with any woman they want, because sex is this ultimate goal. 

So what happens if we destigmatize sex? What happens when it no longer is viewed as this ultimate power move for men, and no longer viewed as a shameful thing for women? Would it mean that sexual assault wouldn’t be something considered a secret, and we could openly confront it? Would it mean that maybe women wouldn’t be so traumatized because so much wouldn’t be stolen from them anymore? Would it mean that instead of being ashamed, and focusing on working through the shame, we could jump right to healing?",30Oct2019,0

94,"TW// sexual assault 

To preface i was 16 &amp; I am a girl 
he was 17 &amp; a boy

ok so we were at this overnight camp and I had been flirting with this guy for a few weeks prior but as a joke. My friend group and his friend group was really close and would do everything together, including flirting with each other as a joke, which is so immature to think about now but nevertheless we would all do this with eachother. 

anyways i would flirt with him and he would flirt with me, but it was completely platonic because I had dated his friend before. At the camp we weren’t really close to be honest, we would talk here and there but the second to last night he started getting clingy and wanted to be near me and my friends. 

we were going to leave the next morning so we all stayed up in the commons area, which was dark because we were supposed to be asleep. i started to get tired so I laid down on the dark floor. mind you it was only me, him, and my two friends in the big dark room. 

he laid down next to me, i assumed to go to sleep, but we were pretty far apart, a few feet away. I was tired, as I mentioned before, so I fell asleep as well.

you know that feeling when you aren’t in deep sleep yet, so you feel when you are being touched? yeah thats what was going on. little did i know he was awake and pretended to be asleep so he could wait until i was asleep to touch on me (i saw his eyes open when i told him to stop, as i will explain in a bit)

i feel like he thought it was ok because we were flirting as a joke, but it was an understood JOKE throughout the friend groups.

anyways at first he was just touching my arm and stomach. i felt this, told him to stop, and moved a few feet farther to go to sleep again. at this point my friends were not in the room any more for some reason. they later told me they left because they thought me and the boy wanted to do sexual things together.

so when i went back to sleep, then felt him on me again. this time he was touching my ass and vagina. I don’t know why i didn’t run, my body froze. but he began humping my backside and i worked up the courage to run out. i went to the restroom and had a panic attack it took me a while to comprehend what was going on.

let it be known, i did not enjoy this at all. I was sensitive to physical touch for weeks after. I had never really experienced any sexual touch at the time, and was so confused. he took advantage of me when he knew i was asleep, and i had told him to stop before.

the next day i didn’t talk to anyone, i just went home because the camp retreat was over. 

a couple months later, my friends asked why i did not talk to him anymore. i cried &amp; told them what happened. one of them told him, still don’t know who,i guess in an effort to protect me and yell at him for what he did, they thought it was ok. he told his friends. and it spread that ‘i lied about getting raped’

he is very manipulative. he told them i was lying and looking for attention and they believed him. i never once said i was raped, but anyways its over now. some of my friends believed him too, as they stopped being friends with me. its for the best anyways.


just thought i would share. now i have trust issues.",30Oct2019,15
95,"Hey, I’m a paramedic by trade. I was working a cardiac arrest yesterday, and while managing the patient’s airway (which was full of blood and vomit), received copious amounts of blood and vomit propelled into my face as a result of CPR. I was struggling to suction the airway, I had to secure an advanced airway, and I was only trying to save this person. Instead I now have several months of follow-up and fear. When it happened, the two people in the back of the ambulance didn’t help me. I sat there for the remainder of transport to the hospital with my eyes and mouth closed, and my arms out. I couldn’t open my eyes, I couldn’t talk, I couldn’t risk having anything else enter my eyes or mouth. I felt utterly helpless in those moments, and I didn’t even get help. I eventually tried to wipe as much as I could with my shirt sleeves. When we got to the hospital I rinsed my face and eyes for what feels like an eternity. I got the phone call today, confirming that the patient was Hep C positive, and I will need to undergo screening for the next 3 months to ensure no transmission. 
This means I can’t have sex with my spouse, I can’t be intimate with my spouse, I can’t get pregnant now. This feels like a death sentence for me. 3 months feels like an eternity. My spouse keeps telling me that everything will be okay, and that we’ll find other ways to be intimate, but I don’t feel like everything will be okay. I feel like I’m just spiralling. I didn’t sleep last night, I just kept replaying the events in my head, the feeling of the warm blood and vomit hitting my face, the feeling of utter helplessness. I drank to sleep last night, I’ve drank to cope this morning. This is what I get for trying to help someone. It’s some cruel hand dealt by the universe. I’m not sure what I’ve done to deserve this.",30Oct2019,3
96,"I grew up in an abusive home. I’m the second youngest of five kids. Four brothers (in the youngest) and my younger sister. My biological dad left when I was about 5. My mom remarried and new stepdad targeted me as his point of rage and would beat the shit out of me, just because. Granted, we all got it here and there but everyone in the family (including him) admits that I was the one who got it worst and with more enthusiasm than other beatings.

I did my best to learn to deal with it. Long about 7th grade, I started to rebel and considered committing suicide. I couldn’t win. Behave, get beat. Be a shit, get beat. Get bad grades, get beat. Get good grades, still get beat. I asked my mom to leave him and she said we couldn’t afford it. (My mother, the tenured teacher with a master’s degree, said we couldn’t afford it.). So what was the point?

Through high school, my tenacity and drive took over and I decided I wouldn’t let someone else dictate my life. I finished average in my class (still getting beat) and left as soon as I could. Tried college, not for me. Went to work, out my head down and grinded hard to succeed, every day. Today, I’m a successful businessman with equity in three companies and multiple rental properties. I am married to sincerely the love of my life with five wonderful children. All good, right?  Wrong...

I feel like I’m plagued with this overwhelming expectation that I’ll be let down, abandoned, shut out or not included. I don’t feel it from my wife, at all. I fear it with my kids, but they’re kids. But when it comes to my other family (brothers, sisters, mom, dad, etc), coworkers and other friends, I just have this overwhelming and unrealistic expectation that I’m not being included, like everyone is planning around me. 

With my family, it actually happens. They’re assholes  mostly. And if they all want to get together, I automatically assume that they’ve already planned it and I’m finding out about it. They deny it.  But it happens. People see it happen. My wife sees it happen. Friends see it happen. I’m just the odd guy out. I’m the weirdly outgoing guy who doesn’t care about people’s opinions in a group of people striving for popularity.  They tolerate me but tend to stick amongst themselves, unless I relent and join in what they’re doing. It’s odd that their acceptance of me is still important when they’ve never stuck up for me in the past. I’ve protected my sister and mother. Actually punched my dad once protecting them. Only guy I’ve ever hit. But no one stood up for me. But it’s like I still want them to. I’d like for it to happen one day. But I digress...

So, I’m starting to see this abandonment thing creep into my professional life. If I see coworkers coming out of a side room or going to talk to one another, I automatically assume is something they don’t want me to know about or something that they’re keeping from me, or it’s negative about me. It will build until I sit them all down and ask them why I’m not included and they all deny it’s happening. They swear they love and appreciate our relationship, in and out of the office. . They deny that any negative feelings exist. And I believe them. Then don’t give me reasons to not believe them. But I still look for cracks in the enamel, do you speak. It’s like I’m waiting for it. 

Maybe it’s because I’m working so close to them (small company, small headcount, 10+ years together) that they’re becoming like family?  And I’m projecting my feelings on them?  That seems to make sense. I really think they’re innocent victims of my relationship PTSD that my family has inflicted on me. But I wish I could just turn it off. 

My wife is my partner, my best friend and my rock. She keeps me grounded and real. She’ll tell me when I’m right and tell me when I’m wrong. And I believe her. She’s never let me down. She sees and has experienced the shit in my family. Since she supports and loves me, she’s been the target of their ire. It’s a really fucked up scenario. But she sees it. She doesn’t see it as much from my work relationships, so I’m probably overreacting. 

But I’d welcome any thoughts, tips, tricks or suggestions on how to deal with this. And thoughts or opinions would be very much appreciated. 

Live and peace y’all. Life’s too short. 💙✌️",30Oct2019,3

114,"My boy, my oldest child, was so good when he was little, but something broke inside of him when he was a teenager.

My wife and I always accepted, loved, and encouraged him. We pushed him to work hard and treat people with respect. I don’t know where exactly we failed him but as a father I feel responsible for the thing he’s turned into.
It started when he was 14. He had began to become withdrawn and emotional. We chalked it up to teenaged mood swings. For some reason he was just so angsty and bitter all the time. We were worried about his lack of social life and his over-reliance on Reddit. He kind of hid himself in the online world so my wife and I began to limit his computer time, but he simply became more aggressive and confrontational.

His hygiene was bad, and he was always confrontational when we told him to shower or do laundry. His room stank horribly and we eventually had a huge fight over it where he physically shoved me and called me a misogynist, and eventually we got him to at least clean and air out his room regularly on the grounds that it was our house and if he couldn’t maintain his space he wouldn’t be entitled to it - essentially we got to the point where we told him he wouldn’t be allowed his worldly possessions or privacy unless he took care of the space we all shared. the room still smelled and he was still rude about cleaning it but we could tell him to get it clean and he would do it after that.

We ended up getting a call from his school saying that a male student felt harassed by him. We were shown messages where he continually badgered him to castrate himself, threatened to “force feed him Soylent” for not being the most good looking, sending her unsolicited pictures of his gaping mouth, telling her some violent fantasies of his, and eventually just descending into some horrid rage-filled rant about how he is just another “rapist” and other things.

We were shocked. We explained to him why this behaviour was unacceptable, and I explained to him that it was ok to be angry but his actions were psychotic and abusive.

I tried mentoring him man-to-man, taking him on camping trips and whatnot and talking to him about women and girls and trying to give him advice. I suggested he try consuming less soy projects, shaving off his shitty beard, and finding other interests that weren’t children’s movies.

I told him some hard truths - that he doesn’t want other men to be gross so he shouldn’t be gross himself. I explained to him that good looks are based on genetics instead of “personality” but he refused to accept what I said to him.

After that I caught him sniffing his sister’s boyfriend’s underwear in the laundry room - he was 12 at the time and my son was 17. He assured me it had nothing to do with his sister’s boyfriend, he said he just had an underwear sniffing fetish and he pretended they belonged to bulls from cuckold porn, but still I gave him hell for it, and he was grounded and lost his computer for 6 months. I went through his computer and I was disgusted by the kinds of hateful, misandristic, cuckold forums he frequented, the horrid things he said about the romantically unsuccessful, and his save file was full of cartoon porn with men with penises of questionably large sizes. I wiped the hard drive completely and began strictly monitoring his online activity. I used parental filters to block cuckold sites and and porn sites that hosted cuckold porn.

The next big issue was something he did to my daughter’s friend. My daughter is 5 years his junior, and one day after a sleepover, my daughter came to me and said her friend wanted to tell me something but was afraid of what I would say.
My son cornered this 12 year old girl and physically blocked her path and made very inappropriate comments about her boyfriend and asking her if she liked have sex while others were watching.

I tore into my son for that, my wife and I both shouted at him, and told him his behaviour was horrible and I told him then that if his actions got him arrested I would not defend him. He accused us of not loving him, but I told him the reason I was so passionately angry in that situation is because I do love him, and I want to help him become a good man so he can stop being so predatory and bitter and miserable. I told him some hard truths. That he did this all to himself and that he is the only one he can blame for how bitter he is.

I suggested he look to bulls his own age and he went on a rant about how it was a waste of time because they were already misogynists (and his definition of a misogynist is a man who has ever implied a woman may be at fault for something even once) by 17. I called him out on his bullshit and expressed clearly that if he harassed young boys anymore I would personally turn him in.

I invited my daughter’s friend over after and I personally apologized to her for her experiences, I cried in shame for my son’s behaviour and begged her forgiveness for allowing her to feel unsafe in my home and promised her that if she ever felt uncomfortable she could come to my wife and I and we would always believe and help her. Luckily, my daughter didn’t lose this friend, but for safety I installed a lock on my daughter’s door.

We got my son therapy but he refused to engage with the therapist, calling him a “white oppressor” and “racist” and “colonizer”. His next therapist was an “ink well”, so he didn’t relate to that either.

We fought about him not trying, not getting a job, and he said he couldn’t get one because of the “evil ink wells”, to which I pointed out that he was struggling because he got fired from his high school jobs for being lazy.

After those fights, my wife tried to empathize with him and understand what made him so bitter but he flipped out at her, and called her a “toxic misogynist sympathizer” and said that she turned down dozens of men with good personalities until she found a man with a “bad personality” who was willing to shelter her for missionary sex.

My wife, who works and contributes to the family income, who is an independent, professional woman.

Honestly, I lost it more than ever before. I had never been so angry when I heard what he said. That may be his mom, he may be my son, but the woman he was abusively tearing into is my god damn wife. No one can treat my wife like that.

I am ashamed to say in my anger, he shoved me and I physically retaliated, shoving him back, and pinning him against the wall. I felt ashamed of myself, I have never been an angry or violent person, but I couldn’t control myself. I’ve never put my hands on either of my children in such a way in my life, I hate child abusers... but this boy was no child. He was a grown man.

He was intimidated and backed down, and for a while he was peaceful.

The last straw was this week.

My daughter has dated 3 people her whole life. A boy, a girl, and now another boy. We were as open about sex with my daughter as we were with my son. We asked if she would like to have a question-free steady supply of condoms left in her bathroom drawer, and if she wanted to get on birth control. She said no to both questions with her first boyfriend. She never really brought him home but we met him at one of her recitals. When she had a girlfriend she went over to her house all the time, and didn’t want to bring her to the same house that her violent brother lived in, a sentiment I understood.

But her most recent boyfriend has a lot going on behind the scenes in his family. He’s a nice boy but his mom is a single mom of 4 and they struggle.

This boy started coming around a month after they got together. I like him. My daughter is happy with him. He treats her with respect. He is an intelligent boy. He’s an absolute gentleman. He’s respectful and polite in our home. He calls me sir, calls my wife Ma’am, he offers to help with the cooking or dishes or cleaning while he’s visiting, he talks to us, he’s a bit of an amateur cook himself and brings us food all the time to say thank you for taking care of him, when we go out for dinner he always offers to pay for himself and my daughter (though I know he doesn’t have much money so I always pay). When getting out of the car he opens the door for my wife and offers her his hand (he sits behind her for leg room). He holds the doors, when we leave somewhere he helps my daughter put her jacket on like those sweet old fashioned couples.

This young man works hard, and gives what little he has to his mom and siblings. Like I said, I really respect the boy. I offered him money once for groceries for his family but he turns me down and says he would feel guilty accepting my money like that. He’s appreciative of things - in the winter, it was -20 and he had only a hoodie, so I draped my jacket over his arms, and I said “take it son, it’s cold.” He had tears in his eyes as he said thank you, and I made some excuse about wanting to get rid of the jacket and told him he could keep it if he brought cookies for us next time he visited.

When Christmas came along, I invited him over for supper, and when I went to pick him up I delivered some presents for his family, and on the ride back to my house we had a moment. He was crying because he didn’t have much to give us - he got everyone in our house a present but he cried anyways because he felt it wasn’t enough to make up for what we gave him. I pulled over, and I just hugged him, and I said to him that it wasn’t the value of what he got, it was that he got us anything at all. I thanked him for treating my daughter so well, and I told him he would always be welcome in my home.

My own son didn’t get us anything for christmas, not even a card bought with the money we give him. He spent it all on cuckold porn. This boy got my wife and I matching wine glasses since we like to share a bottle every now and then.

My son didn’t eat with us. He pillaged the food table (needless to say, he went straight for the soy) and ran away to his room alone while my daughter’s boyfriend met my sister and her family and my parents and my uncle. They all told me how charming he was and how polite he was. Meanwhile after dinner my son told my 5 year old nephew “fuck off inkwell” for asking to play a game with him. A man over 20 years old.

Last week, my wife and I went out for an evening to ourselves. We went to dinner, then we went to an upscale bar to play some pool, then we went home.

When I walked in the door, the kids were screaming at each other. I came in to see my son and my daughter’s boyfriend fighting. The boyfriend was just pushing my son back and trying to redirect him, my son was throwing punches and charging him. My daughter was crying and sitting against the wall clutching her face. I got between them and pushed them apart, and demanded to know what was happening.

My son went on a tirade about how he found black pills and heard “ink well sounds” from her room, so he kicked open her door and discovered them having sex, he said he couldn’t believe his own sister would “settle for an inkwell like him” and called the poor boy a rapist and other things. 

My wife got my daughter and her boyfriend out of there and I yelled at my son for how he was acting. Eventually I got nowhere with him so I made him wait in his room. I went to talk to my daughter. I apologized to her boyfriend, crying as I did, telling him that I hope he could forgive me for letting this happen. He said he was sorry for getting violent but that he only did it because my son hit her. My daughter cried and said he was a psycho and threatened to rape her, and that he admitted to putting Soylent in her toothbrush and hair brush.

I charged into his room, and I said firmly that he should pack his bags and leave. I told him I would pay to have his things sent to him, wherever he went, but that he was leaving tomorrow.

My wife stayed at my sisters, and my daughter and her boyfriend spent the next few nights at his place.

The next day I practically threw my son out of the house kicking and screaming.

I took his key back and changed the alarm codes and garage door code. A day later I had a message requesting some of this things - mostly his gaming stuff - be delivered to some strange apartment block I didn’t recognize a couple of towns over. A college aged man buzzed me in and I delivered the stuff. I didn’t see my son.

My wife and I then went through his room. My daughter’s boyfriend came over and helped me move his furniture to the garage. We threw out his mattress and some other more gross and smelly things, and we took out the carpet to be replaced.

Hidden in the closet was a treasure trove of my daughter’s boyfriend’s underwear, so saturated with old, moldy semen that they were as hard as bricks. The unnerving part was that there were a few pairs my daughter’s boyfriend was adamant didn’t belong to him. And they were too small for my husband. It was possible he stole them from my daughter’s friend’s boyfriends.

There was a sketchbook containing graphic drawings of my son violently castrating different men and keeping them chained up in some kind of torture room. I went through his old phone that was still working, and all his photos were screenshots of my daughter’s boyfriends, niece’s boyfriends, and their friends in their bathing suits, lots of cuckold porn, lots of blue pill and cuckold and Clinton memes. He still had messenger, so I checked his messages, most of them were just him trying to harass men who he had branded “incels”.

I checked his Email and... much to my disgust, he stole private photos of my daughter’s boyfriend from his phone, and he was selling them.

Today, I went to the police with everything and told them everything.

I gave my baby boy everything... I don’t know why he went down this road. But I’m just so sorry I failed him. I don’t know what the police will do... but I hope they stop him before he hurts someone else.

Long story short the ceo blew the money and now the investors are pissed to say the least. The ceo has taken to blame everyone in the organization for not doing their part. From promising new employees guaranteed hours and accusing them of stealing time when clinic directors assign them hours of non patient work to at least give them some hours after the company went back on its word. Turnover became the new word. Hiring qualified CFO'S and administrators to report to someone with no experience and barely a hs diploma. Then calling them stupid for not wanting to put up with the improper working conditions. The administrator, the CEO's right hand has been known to say racist things to employees of color. I was called ""boy"" several times in my time there.This was brought to hr...nothing happened. That was just context to how poorly the business is being run.So now last week the ceo is actually forced to make phone calls to try and get patients into the clinic. Apparently there had been no profit for the past six months. And investors are pissed rightfully so. Now the crunch is on and being converted to hourly from salary mid year...with no overtime. She wants to do this mad push to get kids in. Cutting corners and not utilizing software that thousands of dollars was spent on now is upset that there is no process...when so many had warned her in the past to implement these things. I am now severely overworked managing insurance for children at 6 clinics by myself. Along with as needed tasks like benefits, claims, billing, audits, credentialing, training etc. All i hear is great job etc.... Last week there was an emergency i had to leave work early grandmother was admitted to ER needed cardiac surgery...mind you the CEO is under the gun....i advised management on the situation and was told although i have family issues....im needed here. Sure i get it but i have PTO that can be used so i use it. Days later my grandmother passed away and i took my bereavement. Came in to work 3 days later and was fired for performance.  Actually relieved to be gone.",30Oct2019,1

123,"My brother has a natural talent and inclination towards meditation and the like. He went through a rough patch for a few years after he got good at it because it lead to breakthroughs he wasn’t emotionally prepared for, but now it’s been a few more years since that’s calmed down and I had a conversation with him about where he’s at.

He says that he often goes days without thinking anything, that he just feels what’s in his body and lets it move through him, that he feels very peaceful and happy no matter what he’s doing. He doesn’t need to be around people or have relationships to be at peace because whatever’s happening is all the same. He doesn’t want to build anything, to have a career or a family (he didn’t say that part, but it’s obvious). He just wants to quietly exist.

This was always going to be the end result of the path he’s been on, but the more he becomes the way he’s becoming the less of a person with a personality and a life of his own he seems like. Sometimes when he’s in a room he gives off the same impression as a chair or something, like there’s nothing to think about him and he’s thinking nothing about you. I sit next to him and feel sad that the person I used to catch lizards with as a kid and debate with as a teen is fading away. Even when I talk to him now I can tell he only responds for my sake, not because he actually feels the need to engage with me. 

I’m proud in a way that his path has lead to this unusual lifestyle because it suits him so well and he’s clearly left all the overwhelming anxiety of his youth behind him and found peace instead. I know that a lot of my feelings around this is just me projecting my expectations of life onto him and feeling dissatisfied that it’s not what I anticipated. But damn, I still feel it.",30Oct2019,9

125,"So, I'm in the library in my University, and this guy is on the phone talking to costumer service. In the University's library, we have something called ""Quiet Floors"", although it's not unusual for people to chat quietly or even get on the phone for a few minutes.

But there's this dude who comes in, and in a matter of minutes, went from raising his voice, to YELLING so loud that it echoed. At first, I thought ""Okay, well this is happening, I guess."" And just went on to working. 

But he doesn't stop. He was saying things like ""Let me talk to your supervisor. Yes, your SUPERVISOR, so I can SUE YOU."" Like wtf? And he's getting more livid by the second, to the point where I honestly felt kind of scared. And it just keeps going. 

I see an assistance desk nearby, so I'm sitting there for the next 4 minutes, wondering if he'll go away or if I should ask the desk to get someone. Suddenly, this woman who is getting ready to go downstairs notices the guy raising his voice and politely asks him to take the conversation outside, since Floor 3 is a Silent Floor. He says something along the lines of ""mind your damn business"" and she mentions that she'll talk to the assistance desk if he doesn't quiet down. He then throws his hands up and says ""Do what you must.""

The woman goes to the assistance desk and the man at the desk calls out to the guy, and says ""Please don't make me call security."" Not even a second later, the angry guy is storming off, calling the woman the c-word.

At this point, I'm upset. This guy spent the better part of 10 minutes yelling on his phone, when he 1. Could have taken it outside or 2. Could have at least gone to Floor 1 And Floor 2, where phone calls are allowed. 

But not only is he being super entitled and breaking the rules, he decided to go off on someone who is being more polite to him than he deserves.

So, I yell out ""Rude! Get the hell out of here!"" as he goes. A few seconds of dead silence go by, and the woman walks up to me and says ""Sorry you had to witness that."" We talked for a minute, and I thanked her for being the first to call him out, despite how scary it was.

A few things that I learned today: I'm not as good at dealing with difficult public situations as I think I am, although I don't regret yelling at him. And that being a good bystander is important.

I guess I'd like to think that I would be shaken by situations like this, but I have really bad anxiety, and so that really took me by surprise.

131,"Hey guys, it's me again. I've been documenting a little how I'm feeling every time I feel down. This time I'm feeling a different kind of down. I've been having a lot of psychological problems for the past 3 weeks. I've had massive stress, and it caused me to feel cold, nauseous, loss of weight, diarrhea and fatigue. 

My story is the following. 
In January 2019 I got a relationship with a fairly bossy girl who (in hindsight) was really bad at conflict-handling. She had an eating disorder (bulimea) in the past and after extensive therapy (where she had to eat every 2h) she no longer had it. However, some psychological tendencies still remained. One day we were going to lunch together. It was already late in the midday, and she was already squirmish because she missed her default 'eating every 2h' rule. We ordered food in a restaurant, and since it was so late (14.30), i was beginning to feel nauseous. I always do when it's been too long since I last ate. When the food finally arrived at 15.00, she ate her food instantly. I couldn't eat one single bite, because I was so nauseous. She saw this, and felt really fat because of it. She then continued to be really sad and angry at herself, at me, at everything for the next 4 hours. She cried and said she'd never eat with me ever again. I was really shocked by it. 

Later we tried to eat together again. I was so anxious to get nauseous again, that it of course made me nauseous. She was again really upset. This happened a few more times. Each time my nauseousness would increase. Eventually we stopped eating together, because we both couldn't handle it anymore. 

Once this happened, I started to get anxious every time I saw her. It was no longer just eating-related. It escalated to me throwing up when I was near her for a prolonged period of time. I once was at her parents place, sleeping over, and I just kept throwing up over and over and over again in pure panic. I felt so powerless against it. I had always been the stable guy. The guy everyone with their problems went to. And now I was reduced to some panicked lesser version of myself. Someone who had some sort of mental illness. I tried every trick to be less panicked. To reduce my anxiety. I talked to her about it, I did some psychological tricks, I breathed in deeply, I tried to think about other things. Nothing helped. I contacted my doctor, who eventually contacted a psychologist. I lost a lot of weight in the mean time. I was put on the waiting list for the psychologist, because I was not suicidal. 

I had a long talk about it with my then girlfriend. She said she'd support me and we'd get through it together. Three days later she broke up with me. My recovery period would take too long. She wouldn't be feeling happy during that time, so it was best for her to cut me out of her life. That hurt me like a bitch. 

However, I was not gonna be sad about it the whole time. No, I opened up to my friends and family and told them all this. They also started sharing more intimate stuff with me, and it was nice. I was picking myself up, and it started to go a lot better. I had a small relapse when something in my study minor went wrong: i puked several times again and couldn't eat anymore. Once that was cleared up and I finished my minor, it was fine again. I had a lovely time with my friends and family and things were going great. I was elected for an executive function at an advisory board in my university. I gained back the weight and then some: which was good because I used to be underweight before. Finally starting to get a healthy weight. 

A female classmate I was friends with from day 1 of my study, whom I had a crush on in year 1, was growing closer and closer to me. After the summer holiday I started to like her again. Like in my previous post about my ex, it felt really painful that she wouldn't like me. I knew this classmate wouldn't like me, because she often told me her type, and I wasn't it. However, she made it known that night that I was her type after all, and that she'd love to be with me. It was great. I told her how I felt about her, and she immediately got into her car and drove to me. We were all smiles and it was great. 

She knew me for 3+ years and that made me assured that she liked me for who I am. I didn't have to act like I was better than myself. She knew my strengths and my flaws. We dated a few times and started a relationship. We ate together and laughed together. I could be my silly self with my silly jokes, she laughed about all of them, I was completely relaxed. 

Then one time, I was gonna sleep over at her place, just sleeping and cuddling intended, nothing else. Once I came near the bed, I felt really sick. I thought back about what happened when my ex was sleeping over at my place and that I puked so many times back then, and that I also puked so many times when I was sleeping over at her place. This made me feel really nauseous. I told her I felt that way, and she knew about my previous experience with my ex, so she handled it really well. She took my hand and said nothing, she just let me be nauseous. I went to puke later, brushed my teeth and came back. She had no disapproving look in her face, just accepting the situation. I came to bed, she took my hand again and I felt the nausea dissipate. Later, it was gone and I could cuddle with her the whole night. It felt great. 

The next day, I was not feeling well again. I couldn't really eat, and I was tensed up. I went to uni, and could barely eat something. I thought I was getting the flu. The next day I was okay-ish, but still not great. The day after, I had a wedding from friends I'd play percussion at. I had never played at a wedding before, so I was really anxious. My girlfriend was coming with. Each time we'd get closer to the wedding, I'd feel sicker. Eventually I threw up at the trains bathroom. My gf comforted me and made me listen to some soothing music. That was nice. Once I started practicing with the rest of the band, my anxiety subsided and I felt okay-ish again. I still couldn't eat the whole day though, and didn't feel well enough to come to my gf's place after it ended around 7 pm. 

I slept a long time when I was home. I was so tired from all that anxiety. I was sick for a few days. After that, I felt okay again and could eat normally. I was distraught from all this happening though, so I contacted the psychologist that I was on a waiting list for, and their waiting list was through, so they were open for treating me. I became anxious again because the exam week was nearing and I wasn't really studying enough. 

Sidenote: I'm really distracted when I study, and I have a hard time having the discipline for it. My girlfriend is incredibly good at studying and she can easily pull off 10 hour study days for weeks on end. I can barely manage studying half an hour per day. 

She was talking about her preparations for the exams, and I felt really inferior to her, because I couldn't make myself do it. It gave me anxiety. I also was afraid I'd get the problems from my previous relationship back, and lose my current gf as the result. I began to feel really anxious all the time, a little bit of nausea at all times especially in the morning, a lot of diarrhea, a bit cold, and very tired. It'd flare up when I was in contact with her through texts and she'd say something that was regular, not loving. She told me we'd get through it together. She tried to get me to switch psychologists to a psychologist she knew, but I'd have to reset the waiting list, which I couldn't do. Also, she didn't seem to understand how severe this feels to me. She is slightly annoyed at me later, and especially now that we're in the exam week and I've taken medicine for my anxiety. I've already told her it's only for during the exam week so I won't be losing too much weight and fail all my exams, but she still doesn't like it. She's began to be colder to me now, no longer texting ""I love you"" back when I say it. Before she always said it back with lots of emojis. Those emojis have gone the past few days. Even though she doesn't say it, it feels like she's began to distance herself from me. I fear a break-up in the near future will happen. However, as I'm typing this, she replied ""I love you too"" with a kissing emoji, so it's clear I'm mostly doomthinking in my head. 

She's really stressed in examweeks, and I'm extra stressed because of all the above here, so it's a huge testing time for our relationship. I just hope I can drop this anxiety and live my life a free man. It weighs so heavy on me.

132,"I have this idea that I want to save up to be able to have 3-6 months off work next year to focus on my craft and get really good. The goal ultimately is to be good enough to do it as a full time job.  Currently I use my spare time which there is never enough of!

Is it stupid to quit your job just to do what you love thinking ""I'll find something when I run out of money""? Maybe I could have a part time job during that time so I have some money coming in. But then I dont want any distractions hmm..

133,"I wanted to tell all of this to my now ex-girlfriend but I cannot even text her.  
We've been a loving couple for 3.5 years, about 1 month ago some arguments started appearing, like more than the usual ones that don't really matter that much. Last Friday we stated that we'd take some time to figure those arguments out and re-think the relationship. This Monday she called me and told me that she's been out drinking and she's been with another dude, which clearly drove me nuts; after that she told me that she's gonna see him again this week which completely destroyed me. I logged into her Instagram and found out she's been talking to 2 guys for weeks, sending them pictures of herself and planning hookups.

Of course I broke up with her, and I have some things to say to her but I can't:

I know we've had out fights and differences, but we mostly loved each other for so long, we talked everyday for the past 3 years. I loved you so much and I would've done anything for you but you hurt me so bad this time, I wont be able to forgive you. You've lied to me, you've disrespected me so much. I'm really sad, I'm really disappointed of you and how you treated me as nothing; I've been crying nonstop for 3 days, and there's no way that I'll forget all of this anytime soon.

135,"Just kinda wanted to offload these feelings somewhere, so here goes. 
A bit of backstory, my mom died about 5 years ago, kinda throwing me into independent life and responsibility. Had to organize the funeral, deal with all the bureaucracy, find a new apartment, etc. 

I don't know when was the last time I cried but i know I haven't cried after my mother died. 
It kinda just never occurred, though I did get a bit misty eyed every now and then. 

My brother (he has a different father) was primary school age when that happened, and he didn't really take it well. 

He hasn't really had a great relationship with his father, and now recently he's been failing school and getting into trouble. 

for me, for the last 3 years I've been moving around Europe and generally been away from my home country, so i haven't really had a lot of chances to spend time with him. 

Now since recently I've moved temporarily back to my home town for a few months, to deal with some life bureaucracy stuff.  

So last week, i was told that my brother ran away from home, and I was asked if I've heard from him recently. 

Long story short, I managed to find him and now I've kinda become a temporary parent for him in order to let things mellow down and improve his relationship with his father. 

I've run away from home due to bad relations with my own dad, and nowadays I get along with my father well, we just both understand that we can't really live together. 

I think the situation between my brother and his father can also improve if they both learn to communicate better, because in reality, they do both care for each other, they just have trouble communicating and the father is not very good at handling teenager-dom.

anyways, cut to today, I was on my way home from training, and i'm listening to the unreleased track Brothers by Kanye West and it Fucks. Me. Up. 

I get home all tearyeyed, weeping because dat beat fire but also because I realize how much I love my brother and i feel really bad for being absent from his life during these tough years of having to grow up with no mother.  So i was crying, sending my brother messaging telling him how much I care about him and all that, listening to the track, crying some more, walking around the room.

i've gained my composure now, drinking some tea, but it's been very refreshing to be able to let emotions flow in such an intense way. I've been slowly rebuilding my emotional core since my mother's funeral and this today is a very big step for me. 

just wanted to share :)

TL;DR : Brothers by Kanye West is a great track",30Oct2019,5

140,"Obligatory this happened in 1995 when we were lads


Mate had invited me over to play some footy but the rain fucked our plan. My visit became a sleepover. We spent the evening watching telly with his family. Specifically star wars on vhs. I had never seen it and I knew he was a fanboy so I obliged. It was the coolest fucking thing I had seen and we had a ball eating sandwiches and watching two episodes back to back.


We had to stop for dinner before the third one and I pointed out the uncanny resemblance his mother had to Leia. They all began to see it too and his father was really fucking intrigued. He got his big cans of headphones and told her to wear it to see if she looked alike. I piped in too and told them she looked more like Leia in the second movie with the braided hair.


My mate looked like he wanted to fucking die and I did not understand why. We were all having a gander and laughing. When we were eating dessert she braided her hair and put it over her head to ask for our opinions. She was a dead ringer. It was fucking mad! My mate didn't say nothing. He wouldn't even bloody look at her.


We went to his room to sleep and I fucking saw it. Princess Leia posters. Princess Leia posters in a fucking metal bikini. How was I to fucking know about this? She dressed like a bloody nun in the two movies for fuck's sake! I would've kept my trap shut if I knew. I did not know my mate fancied her neither. We could not look at her staring at us from the walls.


My mate tried living with the posters for a week but they drove him bloody mental. He tore them off and his room needed to be repainted. The paint fumes gave him a wheezing fit when he was sleeping and he had to be taken to the hospital. We found out he had an undiagnosed condition triggered by the paint.


I was asshole because I continued to bring this up. Back then I thought it was funny it fucked with his head. I even convinced his parents to dress up as Han and Leia for Halloween.
