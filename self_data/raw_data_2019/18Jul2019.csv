Seriously though, what the fuck. What exactly is the right option. Where do I draw the line. When do I say, “got dam this guy needs to stop” and when do I say “well he’s trying so I shouldn’t be ass”? It doesn’t even feel like he’s trying. How much time should I give him? And should I reasonably expect someone to make a change so quickly, man idfk.

3,I thought I may end up like that 17 year old boy who was last seen alive with ''three stereotypical looking nerdy guys'' and then was found strangled in his car and the coroner said he'd been strangled between a set of thighs. Why do nerds always choose those horn rimmed glasses and why are they so skinny eating cheeseburgers and shit? They were sitting 5 feet away from me and looked to be 20-25. The thought of getting my neck crushed flat turned me off my fries and coke.,18Jul2019,0
4,"So this last senior year I ended up developing a huge crush on this girl. I always thought she was attractive since like freshman year of highschool, but I never really had any reason to be near or approach her. We ended up sharing one class senior year. 2nd day of school the teacher allowed us to pick our seats, and I ended up coming like a min late and practically all the tables(3-4 students) were filled out. There were only a couple spots available and none by any of my friends. Teacher told me I had to sit down, and my crush told me to come sit at her table with 2 of her friends. I decided to cuz why not. I'm smart, so I assumed that was possibly the reason. I'm a reasonably social person, but I'm usually shy the first week of school until I get back into the groove. We had a worksheet that required knowledge from a previous class that a lot of people in the class too, except I didn't. The teacher asked us to work on it, and since I was kinda shy at this table and didn't know how to do it, I just sat there confused trying to figure it out. My crush saw me and asked if I needed any help on it, explained it to me, and checked in on me again after I did it and asked if I understood it or not. Fast forward to later that month, one girl at the table suggested to make a groupchat for our table for that class and asked me if I wanted to be in it. I gave her my phone number. A couple days after that, my crush asked if I knew whose number was which in the groupchat and asked me for mine. Later that day, she added me on snapchat. She also requested to follow me on Instagram a couple months later after I just had made one. I snapped her that next day a random pic just to see if she would respond and she did. We kept snapping back and forth for a day until she randomly left me on open. I decided not to double snap. Two days went by without a snap and then she finally snapped me. It went back and forth again and then she left me on open late evening but this time she snapped me next morning. Pattern continued from October to December. Obviously, we got a streak and frequently snapped unless she left me on open. I usually responded to all her snaps until one week I decided just to respond once a day for the streak and then ignore her. Twice that week she blue messaged me random questions about that class that were pretty useless tbh. In class, she always used to ask me for help whenever she had a question(cuz I'm smart). We talked a decent amount then(mostly about the class). However, our teacher reorganized the seating assignments in like late October and I didn't get to sit next to her anymore. Since then, I didn't talk in person with her at all, but I kept snapping her. I drew up conversation with her a couple times by responding to her story and talking about if she was ready for a test, and she seemed really nice and had decent responses. Sometimes, I tried sparking a convo by saying a statement instead of a question, but in those instances, she usually just replied with a selfie(like all her snaps). Anyways, December to February she started to never leave me on open and started responding super quickly(sometimes in like a couple second or even minutes even if I took hours to respond). If I had to guess, I'd say she's shy except with her friends and girls. Doesn't really talk to many guys. In class when I didn't sit by her, I got a lot of attention from the teacher since I was smart and aced tests but didn't do homework. A lot of the times I got called out, everyone looked at me and a lot of times she looked at me and smiled. One time I could even hear my name in the convo I think she was saying I was super smart and then looked across the room and smiled at me(doesn't mean anything I know). Anyways, in February she went to a school dance with a dude from another school and through researching, I found out she was dating and had been doing so since early December, which surprised me because her snap frequency and response time really started becoming really good then. I became salty after finding out she was dating, and I cut the 100+ day streak we had because either way we didn't really talk in person anymore and she didn't start convos over snap. She still kept snapping me for a week after I cut the streak until I blue chatted her that I didn't want one. Two months later, I find out she broke up and a couple weeks after that I sent her a snap, and she left me on open. I didn't want to snap her again, so I just left it at that and she never responded back. 



I just want to know if there were any clear signs I should've pursued and asked her out here, or was it all ambiguous and meaningless tbh? I know I should've asked her out either way in the beginning cuz it seemed like she was really interested, but I had limitations. I was kinda addicted to seeing her hot selfies all the time on snapchat and wish I didn't cut our streak since she ended up breaking up because now I basically have no contact with her now. We are going to the same college this fall, but I feel like she hates me now but I still have a major crush on her that I am unable to get over. You think there's any way I could reach out to her when it starts?

TLDR- girl asked me to sit by her, always asked me questions in class whenever she was confused, added me on snap and Instagram, asked for my phone number, and responded to my snaps all the time and quickly. Also tested me(I think) by leaving me on open for two days after we snapped the whole day after she added me first. Smiled at me a lot of times in class and sometimes talked about how smart I was to other people. I cut our streak off(100+) after I found out she was dating and told her to stop snapping me. Snapped her a couple months later after I knew she broke up with bf and she didn't respond. Does she hate me now and did I have a chance or clear signs she liked me for getting her? Any chance or idea of how to reconnect with her in college this fall(we are going to same one)?",18Jul2019,1
5,"I'm 25 years old, but if I hadn't specified, you would think I'm more like 40. When I was in high school, I grew up in a small town in a very unique clique of artsy, passionate kids who all embraced the culture of 70s jam rock our parents grew up with. Some of us did social media to an extent, but some of us completely turned our noses at it, instead valuing face-to-face connections and deep friendships. It was amazing.

Growing up from that foundation, now that everyone has long since moved different places and formed new lives, I find myself completely alienated from how social interactions work in 2019. Way, way too late, I am realizing that I am being left behind and can't form any serious connections. I don't know if that's even a thing people do anymore unless they get married.

I'm something like an introverted extravert. I do great with a spotlight on me, and I have learned to enjoy a medium-sized party, but what I crave are the days when there was no question who I was spending my night with; it was a matter of a phone call to ask, ""So what are we doing tonight?"" I'm definitely an eccentric person who says big, philosophical things or weird, Monty Python types of things on a regular basis, and I tend to either feel huge, huge affection for people or not want them in my life at all. I can't really take selfies properly; I never feel comfortable looking at the camera. I have to be looking off to the side, more like a portrait shot.

I feel a little humiliated asking this, but how does friendship work in 2019? Especially interested in perspectives from artsy/weird people and really affectionate people. Thanks",18Jul2019,11

9,"I hope this is an appropriate sub. I’m going to try to give you a picture of my life. I am a 16 year old girl. I don’t think I’ve ever mentioned my age on reddit, so blowing that out of the way first thing feels kinda weird. I’m pretty enough. I like to think my heart is usually in the right place. Anyways. 

I have definitely been through my share of things, especially for my age. When I was almost 15, my father passed away. He had been sick mostly my whole life, and we were never very close. This drove me and my mother apart as well, but we have since fixed our relationship and are close again. Because he was sick my whole life, I never really had a dad. I had one, but he couldn’t do the things everyone else’s dads could do. From the time I was in elementary school, I envied everyone with a, “normal,” life. 
My childhood wasn’t horrible, but I was limited. We couldn’t go many places or do things like normal families, so this made me spend a lot of time in nature, and with my nose in a book. I would say this definitely made me smarter, but it only fueled the depression that would later set in. In school, I was always quiet and it was an actual problem sometimes. I would not talk to any other kids, not one word, and barely talked to teachers. I have never heard of anyone with social anxiety that bad, but that was me. 

When I started middle school, I cut myself up and developed an eating disorder. I still have the scars, and I still struggle with my image at times but I am no longer obsessive with my weight. I eat just fine. In middle school, like most young girls do, I started to like boys. This resulted in heartbreak of course, which made my depression even worse. I kinda started to talk to others at school in middle school. I was still afraid to speak in large groups, or to people I didn’t really know, but I could talk to my friends and I managed. In 7th grade, I started school online. 

Fast forward to now. I am supposed to be going into 11th grade. My social anxiety is, for the most part, gone. My dad died. My mom moved her new fiancé in, who hates me. I have been living place to place, in more abusive relationships than I care to admit. I am now living with my boyfriend, and I am very happy, yet so unhappy. He is perfect, he’s sweet and loyal and takes care of me. But every once in a blue moon, he gets very angry and it’s truly terrifying. He will punch things and yell and cry and hold a gun to his head. My mom lives an hour away, and I have a car but it’s shitty and bad on gas, and yesterday I got in a wreck that now has me afraid to drive. My car is on the side of the road with two messed up tires right now. I have a job that I guess I like. Although I still dread going to work. I had to leave my pets at my mom’s when I moved out, too. I miss them. I haven’t done school since last year and I am greatly behind. I keep saying Im going to get myself on track, but I never can. I feel so dumb. And I feel like a failure. It’s like I want to do so much but I have no motivation whatsoever and I just cannot move forward in my life. I am not passionate about many things. I don’t have many interests. I have no idea what career I would even want. I just want to sleep forever. It’s pathetic. 

I should be happy. But I’m not. My mental health is in shambles. I have no close friends. When I’m not at work I lay in bed and occasionally smoke weed, in the dark. That is it. I like to cook, but lately even that has been hard. Some days, more often than not, I’m too depressed to clean, or brush my teeth, or even take a shower. I want to go home, but I don’t want to leave where I’m at either. I can’t find any sort of balance. I can’t make myself change. I can’t help myself. I always tell myself I will do something tomorrow, or later, and I never do. I always dream of a day when I’m happy and successful and I swear I will get there, but at this rate I doubt I can even get into college. Lately I wonder what is the point. I don’t know what to do. I am only 16 and I feel like I have already failed and ruined my life. How do I fix this mess?",18Jul2019,10

11,"I woke up one weekday with a sudden perspective of the universe, almost its entirety.

I saw this concept of potential energy and kinetic energy, one of the basic fundamentals of physics. I started to imagine our Universe's expansion and contraction as a pendulum in free space, [going from full potential to full kinetic.](https://serpmedia.org/scigen/images/pendulum_3_ke-pe353x282.jpg?crc=4260082078) On my drive to work, about 45 minutes, I felt like I had grasped onto something. I started to realize that if I viewed this growing and contracting from maybe a different dimension from the outside it would look circular mapped on 2d paper as the cycle was just sinusoidal from -potential to +potential.

I was starting to see it ""4th dimension-ally"" as some sort of infinite series of connected circles of the universe traveling on the surface area of this shape in the 4th dimension. That is everything of this universe including time and other abstracts. I also started to realize the we exist in a series of infinite ""dimensionalities"" where you could perceive that existence integrally and derivatively, from the 5th to the 6th etc. The universe has no bounds (I'll revisit this later)

I quickly told my co-worker/friend at work which we bantered endlessly about meanings of life and just random rabbit holes, and he had some trouble figuring out what I had been trying to explain. So we both naturally scoured the internet to find such an explanation Then he sent me [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBf3LK-zijA) which demonstrated everything beautifully on how I was conceptualizing everything, this was the universe all drawn in my head. Then, as he saw what I was explaing we then started scouring the internet for the keyword ""Toroid"",[to realize this was a donut theory to our universe.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrPifMUUOeA)

Fast-forward to today, I am driving home from an exam at University and an Algorithms exam review at a University and start feeling weird and dissociated with myself from the extreme cold in the room from the terrible A/C, probably from the EC Stack I had taken in the morning, I was also finishing up the NeuraLink stream that had occurred today where Elon and his team revealed massive developments to neural interfacing stuff, , which just triggered my brain into ""intp"" robot/data mode.

Anyway, as I'm driving because of this stream, I'm just having those imaginations and creative logic thoughts as I like to call them. I'm thinking about energy being finite for whatever reason, I start to think about ""well is it really?"" My head starts going to the Toroid stuff I had thought about a few months ago at my internship, I start thinking about the expansion and contraction and the implications of that with potential energy and kinetic energy. Then I start to realize that energy is only finite to us, but is infinite in the Universe, and when I say Universe I mean its entirety not what we live in, but what we are part of - we are a subset not the entirety. I start to have thoughts about how we exist on a differential of infinite energy creation.

Try this, imagine a sin wave function, the derivative of this function at a point is the rate of the energy expansion. I can imagine this akin to our universe expansion as accelerating at the moment and the finite energy that exists the at which all of it becomes kinetic and we stop accelerating but we are at max velocity. The determination of max kinetic energy which = the potential energy is a single point a constant, a derivative of that point in rate of change.

At some point or perspective I should say infinite becomes finite infinite is to describe the rate of change from our perspective, like how Einstein described light. I believe this applies to all laws of the universe from the highest integral.

This also made me think about how modular our universe is and how the universe is an infinitely modular model which is why we are just a series of these derivatives which we can not imagine.

I'm not sure if I'm being cohesive in my explanation at this point as I'm just spilling my brain onto the keyboard, but there it is. I haven't looked up anything about the things past the Toroid. It feels like there is only discovering what has been discovered. Which makes these thoughts exhausting but also addictive.

Thanks for reading, I had to just type out my thoughts, I rarely express these thoughts to others as an INTP-T, if you're into myer-briggs.

I guess I should start with I have bipolar depression (easy explanation is I switch from periods of high happiness to deep sadness) and I have very bad anxiety
I take medication but stuff is still hard, cause it just doesn't go away and I do go to therapy 

Anyways that all aside I'm lonely and dumb, I have a crush on two people which I know is bad but I'm not pursuing either one of them, one is in a relationship and the other just isnt someone I should be with
The one in a relationship is one of my best friends and I don't want to stop talking to them and I'm not going to, I'm just sad, honestly I just want her to be okay and I want to talk to her, I'm honestly okay with my situation with her, but the other girl I like a lot but I know I shouldn't be with her, we're not really alike and I know it would end badly it's just infatuation. I don't know how to get over them and being near them makes me feel lonely once I leave, I'm not gonna stop talking to them cause they both are still good friends of mine

Otherwise I have two other really close friends but I find it really hard to tell them anything honestly just because I'm scared to, i know it's dumb but I feel like I'm annoying them with everything I say, and I also feel like they will stop being friends with me if I say stuff because I always seem so like a happy go lucky kinda person, friends I had in past left when I spoke of my problems, I don't know what to do

I'm just scared and lonely and dumb and well I needed to say it, I don't need advice I know what to do but it is always welcomed, I just needed to vent, if you are someone who read this far thank you, you're a lovely human being and I wish I met you in real life cause you seem like someone who cares and is really nice.

If I read a post on Facebook about how Jesus is the only way and sinners go to hell I feel compelled to argue with or even make fun of that person. 

If someone believes crystals can heal your negative energy I’ll speak up and ask why they believe that and how they came to that conclusion. 

If someone is antivaxx I will insist on them being logical. I even lost a girlfriend I loved over this. 

If I meet someone and they’re telling me they’re okay when they’re clearly not I will tell them they need to stop lying to themselves and others. 

If someone is being fake around me I feel the need to speak up and try to make them see the error in there way. 

I can’t keep my mouth shut sometimes and my aggravation towards the herd that is humanity is overwhelming. This mouth problem of mine has gotten me into trouble and has messed up my view towards people.

When you're done you have to get out of the shower and stand in the cold bathroom again, but this time it's way colder because you're wet. When you're dry and put on clothes again your wet hair takes an eternity to dry and makes your shirt wet and uncomfortable.

It's not only showering but also things like painting your nails, putting on a face mask, making time for a hobby etc. It just feels like wasted time I could spend in bed watching videos. Ironic, isn't it?

Sometimes I'm wondering if it has to do with how my parents raised me.

39,"I'm way too anti-Facebook to go anywhere near Instagram and Facebook (even though I conservatively use Whatsapp and consider it essential in my life, but that's because of the ~~jackasses~~ people I'm surrounded with), so I decided to get back on Snapchat and Twitter.

Twitter started off nice, it's amazing how informative it can be as opposed to (around) 6 years ago when I originally cut it off. But then I noticed that the same problem that I had with it still existed. It's repetitive, so most of the time spent there is wasted, and I'm already going to hear about whatever is trending there when talking to anyone.

Moreover, it's filled with people who put so much petty effort into trying to get famous. It's fucking ridiculous, it's even worse than it was before. The inflation in followings/followers is absolutely bonkers.

It used to be that you'd check someone's profile if you saw a million followers cause they probably mean something, but there are so many nobodies who faked their way through to that number and have absolutely nothing to say. Not to mention the number of accounts that are managed by marketing firms, so it's all just bullshit in someone's name.

Lastly, I appreciate Twitter's improvement on the ""interests"" feature. If I really liked football, they could get me into a community of football related accounts. But that's also a problem cause if I chose that interest alone, I'd never be exposed to any other fucking thing outside football and would miss out on so many things cause they've tailored my timeline and trends to only show related content to the accounts I'm following.

If I didn't already know accounts before I rejoined and didn't follow them, I'd be stuck in a nutshell of interests I picked off of them. But again, it did fix something that previously bothered me, that I couldn't find accounts similar to the ones I want.

Now Snapchat.

As you know it's much more personal than Twitter and direct contact. My previous problem with it pursues. People are so fucking clingy it's impossible. 

And the worst part (that made me leave social media) is that they'd fucking comment on whatever was done there in real life, and they'd ask you why you don't answer n shit. That reason carried over at Twitter and Instagram and Facebook when I had them previously, but now it's just Snapchat.

Not to mention that I almost hate everyone I have on Snapchat cause even though this problem has been addressed countless times, people still act fucking pretentious like everything is great and they'd feel obliged and committed to post everyday.

Had a ""friend"" that literally called me crying and talked about suicide, but the asshole posted hiking photos with his friends and he's all happy in them. When I mentioned it to my other friends they said that he's just fishing for attention. What the fuck am I supposed to believe? 

I had someone who asked me for money literally just two days ago, I have the Whatsapp chat. He said it's out of necessity and that he's in need. He's in fucking Dubai now and his Snaps tell you that he's a fucking playboy.

It's lonely af. It's like there's a giant wall blocking me from people, and I'm exhausted. I have no connection with anyone, I completely stopped talking to my siblings, I've distanced myself off from the two friends I have, it wasn't intentional: it just happened over time. I've never held hands with anyone, the only hugs I've received is from my parents. I'm so afraid of being judged, I barely leave my room. Honestly, I'd kill myself if I wasn't such a pussy.

47,"I really like looking at Loren Gray’s Snapchat because she’s so pretty (I’m a straight female btw. I realized how creepy this would sound if I were looking at her in a romantic way), and I realized that she posts a couple things that I’m not really sure are completely legal but people don’t call her out on it. 

For example, sometimes she’ll post a vid of her driving her friends places on Snapchat. However, in the state of California, if you’re a minor, you can’t drive around people younger than 20 without someone 25 years old or older in the car as well. She’s 17 right now so technically she’s breaking the law.

Additionally, I saw that she’s dating HRVY right now who’s 20 years old. She’s recently started posting a lot of pics of her and him together acting relatively couple-y. Am I the only one who thinks it’s weird that an adult is dating a minor publicly and no one is saying anything?

50,"I am fighting tooth and nail with myself. Every day. But it's not enough. Probably not fighting as hard as I'm saying.

I just feel like I'm lacking in life. Something is wrong with me. I'm trying my best to shutdown as much social media as I can. Shutdown all the distractions and just face myself.

I am incredibly lazy. I just don't work. I don't earn. I don't freaking earn. I don't have the ethic. I want it. I need the discipline, but it's like there's all these blocks in the way. And by the time I'm ready to work, I'm out of time. And then the day repeats, and it's back to 0. It is getting better, but I'm getting old. I'm 25. I need to have the discipline to be able to live on my own. I've been getting better at dealing with it, but I never feel like I'm enough. I never feel like I'm doing enough. I know I did nothing but productive things today. Even if it wasn't money work. But I feel like I'm falling behind. Like I can't hold myself in place. I force myself to motivate myself. I try hard to stay motivated. It just goes away. When I wake up, I forget. I forget all the reasons why I wanted to be the active person I know I can be. The person that can do all the things he knew he could. Someone who's created his life's work. But I'm hardly that person, and when I am, it's gone in a second.

I so desperately need love. I don't have any of it. I don't have the energy or the interest. But I do at the same time. I feel like I'm not even a person because of it. I don't know how to be affectionate. I feel like I'm broken. And I'm trying to pick up the pieces, but I keep dropping them.

I don't know how to be intimate with others. I don't know how to risk it on another person. I feel like somethings wrong with me that everyone notices, but I don't. Never truly had a significant other in my life. I know how to be alone. But I'm tired of it. I can only go this way for so long. And I hate that I'm complaining about feeling so lonely. I feel like I'm not even allowed to complain about that. But I am. I have been. My whole life. Is it karmic retribution? Have I done something so horrible that my crime is written into my spirit?

I feel like I'm constantly playing catch up with how to be a person. Every year goes by and I've improved myself significantly, but it's just not enough. I've searched for inner peace, for balance, for the ability to cancel out negativity. I used to be such a bitter asshole who never smiled. But I'm not anymore. I've tried more and more to be someone who keeps all aspects of his word. More honest than I thought I was. I don't have a best friend. Not that I care much for one. But my close friends, feel so distant. Like do I have any real friends, who I can just call up and say this shit that I'm saying right here to? Do I have anyone who I can fight the universe with?

I just feel like I'm breaking and cracking right now. I don't know. My feelings don't even really matter in the grand scheme of things. I can be another statistic. Another sad lonely unmotivated human being. I want to run away and start a new life. Be homeless, fuck it. I just want to disappear, leave all this bullshit behind. I feel like I'm waiting for someone to save me, but I don't want to rely on anyone else. But I have trouble relying on myself.

I think the thing that bothers me the most is that I don't feel any love or hate. I wish someone hated me with all their heart. It would bring me joy. I wish I could get into a bloody fistfight with someone. I wish someone could love me. I realized some time ago that I don't actually believe someone could love me. Whether true or not, I don't know what it would take for me to believe such a thing. I just feel like everyone sees what's wrong, but doesn't tell me. I wish I could be hurt by the truth. But no one tells it to me.",18Jul2019,3
51,"Long post TD;LR at bottom.

 So I was in a group chat with two of my friends and one we'll call her A and the other J. 
Anyways A texts me asking if she was blind to love. Me being who I am I like to tell people the truth. I don't sugarcoat it most of the time. So I said ""Ehh maybe a little but not too much why?"" 

A:""Just wondering"" 

So I was like ""Okay odd but whatever"" well my question got answered when she went to the GC and told J that I said she was TOTALLY blind to love. I know she was joking but I just said no I wasn't. Now my friend J doesn't really out up with mindless bickering most of the time so she was like ""Explain"" So I did and provided a screenshot to add flair. At the time it was all light and fun in the GC. So I thought nothing of it and J even went along with it. A was like NOOOO then she called me a brat l, and I'll admit I might have been a touch of a brat. But the convo soon stopped.

But I suppose A was bored because out of nowhere she said fish were better than cats change my mind. She knows I love cats, as well as other animals. Anyways I knew she was trying to provoke me since I'm know to get mad easily with some things. But I wanted to have a little fun so I took what A said as an invitation to a debate. I like to debate if the opponent is calm and has their facts. So I said you can pet cats. 
A said ""you can pet fish as well idiot."" 
I was a bit taken a back but brushed it off as a joke. So I gave some other things as a cat can sleep in your bed and you can cuddle it. She said if you get a big bowl you can do the same with fish. I was all like ??????? I knew she was joking but tf?! At this point I was a bit annoyed and confused but continued to calmly give facts to her, since of course she gave a bunch of nonsensical opinions. 
A then decided to say ""all cats were retarded""
At this point I'm sitting here thinking why she's even doing this because she was making herself look very dumb and making a bit annoyed even more. She also knows or at least she should because I've told her in the past  that I have anger issues and it's not fun. So at this point I'm thinking she really is trying to make me say things that she would ultimately regret, as I would as well. So I calm myself down and continue, reassuring myself that this is just a small fun debate. So I give a fact saying cats are known to reduce depression. A just said ""cats a stupid fucking losers"" at this point I feel like I'm arguing with a child and I can't really stand children (please don't come after me this is not about kids)  she then also made a comment saying cats are re*arded. Now I'm sitting down on my bed saying Wow, what the fuck? I type the cats are incredibly smart. (Looking back should have corrected her for saying re*arded since it can be hurtful and demeaning to people)  At this point I was getting tired of this so I told her if she has no facts then she needs to stop. I was getting  tired of it but my dumbass still kept interacting which I should have just stopped. 

So A leaves for a moment. J and I talk for a minute about something. Well A come back saying cat feces can kill people and give diseases.  Now I had no idea. So I searched, and skimmed since she didn't specify any disease. Then she copy and pasted parts of a wiki article on this parasite called T.gondii. Basically it makes you like cats and is a latent virus. I gave her that one. But I asked her why she all of a sudden decided to attack cats. She knows I have a pet cat that I love very much. She said she wasn't and that she loved me. I said okay.

A said I needed to calm down. I was calm though, so I told her that and she was like Chillll. I said I was. Then she out of the blue said she lost her hampster. I said I'm sorry. Well she found the hamster. She then said her hamster was better than my cat. Whoa okay you haven't even met my cat and I have never met you hampster. So I told her that it's natural to say that since she has a bond with her hamster as I do with my cat. Which is normal. She then proceeded for me to chill. I was all like ???. She then said she wanted to mess with my head before bad and to chill again.  I told her I saw this as a debate, and I told her I was calm so I saw no need for the chill thing that's why it confused me.  I told her that I proceeded to treat the convo as a debate since it seemed like you invited me to have a debate with you. So I did. I told her that the opinions did not help her case as to my facts. J took my side on this. 

I must have made her upset. Because she then writes a long sob story paragraph about how she had a bad experience with cats. And how she knew I lived cats and she wanted to get back at me for a dare I gave her months back since I didn't do my dare (It was a personal one and I did not want to do it since it crossed a line)  She then said that she was trying to distract herself for the fact she hugged her mom's bf for 20 secs. She then said sorry for any inconveniences and she would go to bed. 

First of all I didn't even know you hugged your mom's bf. She has a good relationship as it is so I didn't understand. (But I guess I don't understand a lot whatever) I debated with her and messing with her at first but of course I had to be serious. Fuck. 

Is it my fault? I just thought it was a good opportunity to debate something and I wasn't in the mood to joke around. (I was in working mode and I was on a break but I was still in a serious mode sorry if that doesn't make sense) Was I overthinking things. Am I overthinking this as well? I have a feeling I may have been too passive aggressive but was I? I really don't know

If anyone had told me I'd be where I am right now, say, a month ago or even two or three weeks ago I would not have believed it. And yet here I am.

I've met Jörg two days ago. We got to chat in a cute little bar. He's into aviation and loves airplanes, he even has his flying license for small aircrafts! He's 6'7"" and grey eyed, a bit of stubble, full head of hair. He's in his late thirties and slightly greying and yet to me he's practically a kid. Still has a bit of that youthful energy, too. We've gradually gotten more and more drunk as the evening progressed, and as Jörg and myself got more drunk, we also got more scandalous. Turns out we share a pretty outrageous and awful sense of humor. I'm actually a funny man, never quite knew, and he says I have a ""dry sense of humor"".

I’m 22 and I have his cycle I tend to go through. I only recently noticed it myself but the more I get into it the worse I feel until I eventually reach of point when I feel like the only point. Yes, I know all the suicide hotlines, yes I take medicine, yes I go to the gym, and yes I meditate but to no avail.

Anyways the cycle goes as followed -&gt; I’ll feel happy content and confident then slowly become paranoid and unhappy straight into the heavy depression and anxiety. Mind you the paranoia usually hits a bit hard and there’s usually really no big reason for it in reality but in my head everything and everyone just seems to be going against me.

I have been diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety and while I have meds I haven’t taken them here recently because I’m tired I’m so fucking tired and they only make me even more sleepy and tired and useless. I don’t know if there’s more to all of this or not but I’ve just passed the paranoia part, I’m about to move, the woman I love is moving to a different state, and everything is changing...so this one is different it’s hitting harder and the thoughts are getting worse.

Please don’t recommend seeing a therapist I’ve already gone that route and it doesn’t work for my schedule. I’ll be honest I don’t know what I want from this post except some help or maybe some advice. It’s worse this time and life fucking sucks.",18Jul2019,2
76,"Hi there. I'm a 21 years old female who's 3 months unemployed now. Last job I had is being a customer service representative in a call center. I only lasted 6 months there and went AWOL. Reason being is that I lost all motivation. Before, the salary and my work friends were enough to motivate me to go to work, but as time goes by, nothing I can think of is enough to motivate me. I would cry, my chest will feel heavy, I find it hard to breathe just at the thought of going to work. I went 7 days NCNS (no call no show). It even got to the point that I went to therapy, hoping I would be diagnosed with what I'm feeling, so I can take meds or something. I didn't know that therapy doesn't work like that, so after just one session, I quit it. And when I did go to work, I realized I just can't do it anymore. I left just a few hours after my shift began, and didn't come back.

Three months later, and I'm not liking unemployment. I missed having money to spend. So I started applying for jobs. I graduated last 2018 with the course Office Management, and stenography was a major subject. I had experience in being a court stenographer as well, and it was fun despite being difficult. I applied to be a court stenographer in a city hall, but government recruitment takes months (4 to 6 or more). So I applied for CSR again. They recruit fast, that's the thing. I finally settled for one company that is very near where I live, and it's not graveyard shift which is good because I'm not a night owl. I even got interviewed by the Aussie clients themselves. So I got hired, and instead of being relieved, and happy... I cried. I fought back tears during the commute on the way home. I was overthinking. What if I don't like it as well? What if I become miserable again? That's when I realized, even if I thought I could endure for the sake of money, I really couldn't. Even if I'll be letting down a lot of people (bc they only needed one and I got it), if just the thought of it makes me feel anxious, then I'll just wait for the job that I at least enjoy.",18Jul2019,1
77,"For a long time, I have been thinking that I am an introvert, but recently I have realized that I don't really fit into the description of it, and that the parts of me that do fit in are mostly due to my social anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out, I tend to feel way better around people in general, but then again I don't really open myself up that much to people out of fear that I will say something wrong, or do something wrong. But I tend to be quite social around people who I've grew comfortable with. What made me thinking about this was also a friend who is very introverted telling me how he can't keep up with that many plans I tend to make with our mutual friend group, and that it's not because he dislikes our us anything, but that it drains him. I've came to the realization that I feel just like that when I'm not surrounded by people, however, when I am with people I feel guilty of being there, and like a burden on them. I keep overthinking everything I do, and wondering if my friends are just tolerating me, despite some friends explicitly telling me multiple times how much they enjoy having me around. I also get very anxious at complimenting my friends, who I think grealty of, but I'm scared that my compliment will be understood wrongly, or I don't even know why. 

&amp;#x200B;

It overall sucks how I both want to meet people and be around people, but at the same time I feel like a burden no matter who initiates hanging out. But I feel like my main group of friends is more introverted, and they are used to me organizing stuff, and I enjoy doing that, but then again I get the whole ""you're just annoying them"" mindset all the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

When that mindset gets too 'vocal' I tend to cut myself away from people and I tend to feel really miserable about that, so I don't really know. I guess that the worst part of it all is how alone I feel at times even when surrounded by friends who I really care about, and I know they care about me, but it doesn't resonate in my head.",18Jul2019,12

More such incidents will be forthcoming from us &amp; our underlings unless Japan and the rest of the world can agree on the following:

* Japan unconditionally apologize for its WWII atrocities against our Chinese nation and criminalize the denial of Nanking Massacre, and to withdraw its forces from our Diaoyu Islands.

* The rest of the world would not maliciously meddle the normal operations of our internal affairs with regards to Xinjiang Autonomous Region. Contrary to sensationalist Western biased reports, the so-called ""detainees"" over there were actually being positively educated into being more productive members of the society.

86,"I don’t know if this belongs here but I didn’t know where else to write..

I won’t deny my privileged situation of being brought up by parents who could afford everything I needed and some things I wanted, but right now I live in an expensive city, I make £8.50 per hour in a cafe and I live pay check to pay check with hardly any disposable income. 

Today I was walking along about to go into the pharmacy to pick up some prescription medication which was going to cost me my last £20 when I walked past a woman who seemed desperate to get someone’s attention. I listened to her story about the young boy across the street who is homeless and just needs £5 more for some food and for a room to stay in tonight, I told her I didn’t have anything to spare but she followed me into the pharmacy begging me to please help as he was only 17 and her heart was breaking to see someone so young on the streets. I agreed to get out £5 to help as I realised that was the maximum I could spare and still get my prescription. Her story immediately changed to needing to give him £8. Against my better judgement I left the pharmacy, went across the road and got out £10. Again her story changed and she needed the whole £10 for the boy. Reluctantly I handed over the money knowing that I wouldn’t be able to get my anxiety medication now until next week. 

The woman was very grateful she hugged me and pulled me over to meet the boy. Immediately I could see he was drugged up something fierce. He had a cigarette hanging out his mouth, the stink of beer on his breath and his eyes were glazed, red and unfocused. The woman began to tell him that I had just given him £10, he didn’t seem to be able to concentrate and he turned to me and started his whole speech “please miss I’m so hungry I really need to get some food and have a bit of money to get a room tonight do you think you could spare me some change” all the while with my £10 in his hand which he absently shoved into his pocket. 

I just walked away, without the ability to fill my prescription, without my last £10 and without the feeling that I had at least helped someone who needed it more, because it could not have been plainer that these two were just going to go to the local sainsburys and pick up a pack of fags and a bottle of booze. I don’t want any person to be homeless and I find it sad that society often writes off a persons need for housing because of illnesses such as addictions, but I just don’t feel like I did that boy any good and I certainly don’t feel as though he needed that £10 for his drugs any more than I did for mine.",18Jul2019,9

The pay is decent for my area, the management is decent, and the conpany treats their employees well, I just didn't care for my position. 

People are disgusting and lack common courtesy and hygiene. They go into the stalls and wipe their dirty hands on the walls instead of washing them. Ladies don't dispose of their hygiene products properly  The men spit tobacco and gum into the urinals. They (both men and women for the rest of the post) clog the toilets with hand towels. They kick the walls with their dirty boots to make me have to clean more. They throw garbage on the floor.

100," 

We started dating in college. We broke up 6 years ago. I thought it was best. I was unhappy. There were things about him that just annoyed me and struck me as immature, and I was desperately unhappy with our sex life. (I have a vaginismus type condition that was undiagnosed at the time, but I wished he would have put more effort into making sex less painful for me.) Plus I was going abroad for a school year. He loved me and supported me. He never once said to me, ""don't go"" because he knew how important it was to me. He would have stayed together while I was abroad. I didn't want to anymore. Ending that relationship was the most painful thing I have ever done. 2 years later I moved to the same city as him. We always kept in touch. It occurred to me that since he was always so kind and supportive even after we broke up, that maybe he still had feelings for me. I never asked him to meet up because I didn't think I wanted to get back together with him and it just seemed like a can of worms I didn't want to open. He never asked either. I figured he wasn't interested, though I did recall that I had kinda taken that lead to a degree while we were together. That and since I had ended things with him, maybe he wasn't comfortable being the one to ask. I dated other guys, convinced that I would find that dream guy. I never told my ex about other guys, though he must have known from social media. He must have dated in the last few years, though he's never told me about any of those girls either.

Last year I finally got out of a relationship that was not good. We were together 2 years, but we were never in love and he was kind of a jerk to me more often than I wanted to admit. He also turned into a raging Trump supporter. Throughout the year or so before my last boyfriend and I broke up, I thought about my college boyfriend and how much better he was to me. He was a much better person. I became very sad realizing what I had thrown away. He really loved me, more than any other guy ever has. And I loved him more than anyone else. He might have been the only one I ever really loved if I'm honest. He was the only one I felt like I could really be myself with.

A couple of months ago I screwed up the courage to ask my college boyfriend to have a drink. We had lived in the same city for 4 years and never seen each other. I thought I would be able to feel out if he still had feelings for me or not (yes I know after how much time had passed how crazy that sounds). He seemed nervous when we first saw each other and I was too. We had a really enjoyable time talking, it was easy. However, it seemed pretty clear to me that he doesn't have feelings for me anymore. We're just friends, if that. We are just friends who text about city life and our jobs and cats. I was devastated. I cried the whole way home and into the next day, and periodically now. Of course he's moved on like any normal person. He probably has a girlfriend now. We still talk, and in reality it's the same as it's been for years.

Now that I've seen what's out there in terms of men, I've come to fully realize what I let go of in breaking up with him. I was too stupid and immature to see how great he was. No one has loved me like that since and I don't think anyone ever will again. I don't think men really love like that typically. Most men certainly won't put up with their partner having sexual health issues. I should have married him. I guess I got what I deserved in leaving him, but I'm still so sad. I know I need to get over this once and for all and move on but I just don't want to. I can't imagine doing that now. But I don't really have any other choice.",18Jul2019,1

I used to be a professional photographer. I loved to be out of the house, and on the job. But I have Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome +.

And my illness got so out of control that I couldn’t guarantee I wouldn’t be in the hospital so I had to stop working. 

My sense of purpose was lost. I loved being a photographer. But part of that was being a part of making someone’s life better in some tiny way by making their memories last the best way I could. And having that human connection. 

So yeah, I got stuck at home. I’m still stuck at home. But I started meeting people on Reddit. Then, despite not knowing them, I wanted to be able to help if I could when needed. So I volunteered to moderate in a support sub. That led to making lots of connections with people that I fiercely care about throughout the community over time.

112,"My traineeship is ending in about two weeks. I have been applying for jobs the last month and also had a couple interviews. 

Today, i have received two rejections - one of which was a job I really, really wanted in the humanitarian sector. The other one was also a good job in an international organisation with great benefits and the working environment seems to be really awesome. 

Clearly, the first one was really crushing. I was not too sad about the second rejection but the recruiter also included if I wanted feedback I could call her. And so I did. The feedback was very constructive but also made me really sad: she said that while my language skills are great, they could not feel my motivation to work there. It was a short interview (15 min), with open questions but I answered in quite short sentences in her opinion. And she also felt that my answers were even shorter than the questions. They also told me that they felt my answers were superficial. And she asked me if this surprised me. I did not know what to say. I am not sure why this made me so so sad either. Maybe because she was spot on? But also that the recruiters could judge me based on a 15 min interview? The questions were designed to get to know the candidates personality and were not competency based at all but still. 

I am indeed a more reserved person, and I also do not feel the need to talk for the sake of talking. I do not see why I have to fill up voids with sounds when my points came across in fewer sentences. And I do not open up to people fast and tell them stories. I do not need some time to warm up to people. I am feeling misunderstood and frustrated. 

Now it is evening time and I have learnt that another girl got the job offer, and I know for a fact she does not have the language skills I have. And in terms of experience, we are about the same. And it is really frustrating to know that even when I have an advantage, it is not valued. 

I have an upcoming interview on Monday, but I am so afraid to commit the same mistakes that were the reasons I lost this one offer. In addition, it is in the financial sector where my knowledge is extremely basic. And this is for now the last interview I have lined up. 

All I hope for is that tomorrow, I will feel better, with new motivation. But the nervousness is there. And I feel upset with myself. Frustrated with my own situation.

She said she lives just down the road and she has money and her fingernails were trimmed and she had come in before. I think she has dementia. She stayed for about an hour and she ate the cake we offered her and drank a coke. She kept smiling and saying that everything was so lovely and that she was so happy. She repeated in intervals, over and over about how she was scared to go home and that a man was banging on her door so she kicked him and ran away barefoot and that she was happy now. I offered to call the police but she had such a strong repulsion towards the idea. After she left, I sprayed the area she sat with antibacterial spray and wiped everything down. No matter the sympathy I felt for her, in the end I couldn't get over the disgust at her poor hygiene and I shied away from her touch. I felt sorry for her but I couldn't wholly accept her. I saw her at the bus stop on the way home, and I gave her some food and once again offered to call the police since it seemed like she was planning on staying out the whole night and was scared to go home because she though the man was waiting for her to return. But she refused again and at this point, I told her I had to go home now. I didn't insist as I was scared of taking responsibility for her and if I'm being completely honest, I was scared of her and her volatile state.

114,"Alright, I honestly don't even know where to begin with this.  Yeah, clearly I'm a little out there because I've literally heard of nobody else having this issue and/or addressing this way.  So...  I'm a woman who wears my hair tied back into a ponytail every single moment of every day.  I have a really hard time dealing with my hair touching my face and blocking my vision.  If I were to try to explain why I'm like this I'd be going on and on for a very long time and there's actually quite a bit that seems to go into it.  As you might be able to guess, I'm not quite neurotypical- I have OCD (the real kind) and even aside from that am someone who generally places high value on control, organization, neatness, efficiency, (etc).  Anyway, even when I do keep my hair tied back I have quite a few shorter hairs (baby hairs?) that end up hanging out.

Ok, part two of this weirdness:  I often have moments where the hairs that hang out go into my eyes.  If there's any breeze whatsoever it tends to happen.  Also, if I'm driving with the windows down it happens pretty badly.  When it does happen my brain basically goes into serious freakout mode.

The main issue that comes with this is that a lot of the cheaper pairs seem to be made with the intent as a fashion accessory and are poorly made (I've had pairs show up misshapen, also the lenses seem to get damaged pretty easily).  Appearance isn't much of a priority for me here beyond wanting them to look inconspicuous and fit my face reasonably well.

So, does anybody else out there have some experience/ issue with anything like this?  I think I have heard of people in medical professions wearing nonprescription glasses to prevent contaminants from getting into their eyes.  Other than that I feel like I'm pretty damn alone with this!",18Jul2019,1
115,"He makes her feel bad for not noticing him and saying hi to him when SHE DIDN’T EVEN SEE HIM, like how was she supposed to notice him??????? He’s a big hypocrite, objectifies her on the daily and she is buying it all. I do believe he can be nice, but it does not overpower all the shit he says. I feel awful that I’m so annoyed by it.  She’s my best friend, I should be happy for her, but I can’t. I told her I dislike him and found her ignorant on the matter (which was maybe a bit much, I agree, but I was mad), he’s the only subject she talks about and she’s changed. She hated guys like him before, but all of a sudden he’s amazing? I’m frustrated even though I shouldn’t be. Should I do anything at all? Or just leave it be?

Btw I’m not a native speaker, if you are wondering why I make certain mistakes:)",18Jul2019,1
116,"I am a mother (34F) of 2 rowdy boys who are 5 and 2.5. My 5year old started summer camp where they go to these fun events every day. Water parks, mall, movie, fun parks, etc. I listen to way too many true crime podcasts and decided to buy him a small tracker that clips to his belt. He knows what it is. I can see when he arrives at his destinations and where he is at all times though an app on my phone. It’s super accurate and discreet and costs around $150. 

Yesterday he went to a “fun park”. My husband text me around 4:30 to check the app to see if he was back at the school or still at the fun park. According to the app, he was still at the fun park. I called the school and they said all campers were back and ready to be picked up. 

Somehow the tracker fell off and it stayed at the fun park. I called the place yesterday and today and nobody had found it but it was clearly still there according to the app. My plan was to go there after work and find it. Once you are in a certain range you can sound an alarm. I check the app and see that it has moved to someone’s house, someone clearly found it and took it home. 

I’m not mad about it, might be an innocent kid just curious. Thing is, it serves no purpose to them AT ALL. They can’t use it. Once they figure this out they will probably throw it away. What would you do? Forget about it and move on? Go track them down? My husband doesn’t care and said just buy another one but that sucks.",18Jul2019,1
117,"Was taking a shower last night at around midnight. I don't know the extent of other people's imaginations when they do stuff like this, but mine is given to vivid, abstract flashes of a basic idea that often just occurs out of nowhere or from random stimuli I may not even be aware of.

Anyway, shower-- midnight. Started to noodle around in my head with some old doowop elements, speed, melody, general sound. Becomes one of those mysterious, sad, echoey sounding soul numbers. 

Now I'm hearing snatches of voice singing bits of tune. Lead's female, she's backed by males-- at least three. Being in the shower, I imagine it as an old nineties era Zest or Irish Spring jingle.

A song about soap-- a song about a shower. I'm taking a shower at midnight-- and I hear the singer in my head just like that-- ""...Whhyyyy not-- take a shower at midniiiiight...?"" And her backups: *Whiiii-EEE-oooh... take a SHOWER at MIIIDNIIIGHT!* 

Now I'm picturing what they look like-- and they SOUND black. They're keeping me company just outside the stall now, adding a little soundtrack to my shower. I can almost see em out there-- she's a ""large diva"" type backed by... four guys. Yeah. Four. She's in a white dress-- her guys are in white suits with hats.


I start trying to write other bits of this song-- bexause it sounds so good I kinda wanna hear it. She sings off a series of hardships in a day-- I forgot all of em, but they all fit just fine, if a little rough and simple, sung with slow, sad understanding-- this would lead into the lines above. How do they end it?

It's a song about taking a shower, and these guys are good... HER BACKUPS CAN PERFECTLY IMITATE THE SQUEAL AND HISSING PATTER OF A HOT SHOWER TURNING ON!! 

*Whoiiiii-Sssshhhhssshhh...* It sounds so good in my head that I instantly see them as a stage band surrounding a prop shower at a show-- she's the lady in a white bathrobe costume, her backups are all dressed as repairmen. I hear the whole song-- now with piano, drums, and sax-- it ends again-- inspiration! False ending, the real ending comes with a big, flat, atonal ""VA-pors!!"" 

I don't really know why I'm writing about just a random imagine spot I had in the shower-- but I enjoy when that happens, and this was one of the bar none best ones I've ever had-- thought I'd put somerhing constructive up for a change, maybe. I dunno. A look into my weird ass mind I guess.",18Jul2019,1
119,"Hi . I’m scared of my future, I don’t know what to study because I want to study in Europe something related to art. To be a professional pianist or a good painter. But I doubt I would ever be that because I don’t have enough money, my family is too ignorant and I’m scared (as a Latino) that I will not be “welcome “ in whichever country I decided to study in. My goal is to keep learning English and be better at writing so I can communicate with people and show that I’m not just a person who’s going to live in that country. I hope you understand what I mean.",18Jul2019,3
121,"I’m bored at work! I’m not sure if ive just managed to efficiently complete all my tasks but this whole week I’ve just been kind of sitting here on my phone or staring at my computer screen. I would like to do some school assignments or readings but the way my desk is set up I am the first person anyone sees when they come into the office and my computer screen can be seen from my  supervisor’s and director’s desks. 

I don’t want to ask for more responsibilities or let on that I’m bored because then I’ll get a lot of busywork to do. I’m usually more of a team player but they also recently cut down on my hours from full time to part time (budget reasons, not performance) so I’m kind of in a mood where I’ll just do the bare minimum instead of being innovative or extra productive. :/",18Jul2019,1
122,"I grew up in hell because of my ocd, anorexia, and depression. My dad had issues too while I was raised. He has depression and anxiety. Anxiety and depression run in my family, as well as a couple anorexia cases. Ik one of my kids will have a struggle with that. I really, really want to have biological children tho. I want to go to therapy more to unravel my childhood and the systemic problems in my family. I want to know how to help my kid and give them support. Am I still selfish",18Jul2019,2
123,"I kept on telling my housemate I can smell their cigarettes. It used to not come in so I don't know what he did before but yeah 

Soon enough he got sick of it and well I might have to find a new place I think 

I ended up spilling the beans the reason why I dislike it is because of my dad smoking cigarettes so often my mom got lung cancer. He backed off because I started shaking I think and now even an hour later I can't stop crying 

Why am I crying 

I don't cry when I think of my mom anymore or feel super sad but now I'm sobbing and I have to be somewhere soon and actually I'm on the side of the highway right now and it's embarrassing to have my face all red and teary.",18Jul2019,20
124,"I mean, I’m totally open to hear opinions that totally differ from mine, but the amount of closed-minded and judgemental  posts and comments has made me completely sad.

I live in a pretty open-minded and progressive country, and most people at least try to be accepting of the differences between everyone. So I’m not too used to these kinds of the racist, sexist and fat-shaming comments.

I’m surprised people are still judging and defining others in these ways. It’s honestly heartbreaking.",18Jul2019,8
125,"I started treatment for my eating disorder may 30th in that time, I've lost my girlfriend, totaled my car, been feeling the full effects of recovery, cost my parents thousands of dollars for my treatment, become unemployed, my parents had our walls painted grey and carpets changed to grey because they wanted to sell the house, but spent to much on renovation so we're staying, I'm just so tired of waking up to get my shit kicked in daily.

127,"I remember when I ate 1 cup of broccoli every single day for months. It was rough on my system but my body thanked me down the line. Well, that was in January. Here we are in July and I've eaten red meat every day, fast food, and barely enough veggies. I haven't gone to the consistently months.  I hate this part of starting/breaking/starting a good habit again. I can read all the books under the sun (not really thought I don't have the attention span) about improving myself but application is a bitch.  I used to journal everyday, wind down an hour before bed, stretch, roll out my muscles, and meditate. I fell off. Welp, tomorrows a fresh start.",18Jul2019,1
