So, today for the first time in years I felt my hip vibrate again. It’s weird tho because my wrist looked “naked”

2,"Long story short, I asked this girl out but she “wasn’t looking to date”.  We kinda stopped talking (she left the job we worked at, so I didn’t see her anymore).  About 2 weeks ago she replied to my story and we started talking. She said “I MISS YOU THOUGH. ARE YOU BUSY SATURDAY??”. I said no, and she said “My birthday is Saturday and I’m having a little get together. You’re invited :)”. 

That saturday “morning” at midnight she posted on her story screenshots of happy birthday texts her mom sent her (saying thanks), and one a former coworker sent her (saying she missed him). After seeing that I messaged her happy birthday, and she replied “THANK YOU ❤️❤️❤️”. Then she posted a screenshot of that.  I went to her get together and it was fun. Nothing special happened. When I was leaving she said “Thank you so much coming, I really appreciate it. Text me when you get home safe”. So I did and she texted me back “Thanks sooo much for coming!! I’ve missed you and hope to hang again soon !”.  Later I posted a selfie we took and captioned it “happy birthday”. She reposted it and added a heart (❤️).

Since she wanted to hang out, this past Saturday I asked her if she wanted to go to a Christmas themed amusement park this weekend (where we used to work together). She said “YES, what day?”. I offered two days, and she said “let me check my calendar”, but she never got back to me.  Today I was gonna ask if she still wanted to go, then I saw what she posted on her IG story. It was a video of her wearing two different shoes captioned “hypothetically if you were me going on a casual date, which shoes would you wear?”.   I assume she’s going on a date with another guy.  I doubt she’s talking about me since she hadn’t even agreed to a time.

Sooo... I decided to text her “Hey, did you still wanna go to (park name) this weekend? If you’re busy it’s cool”.  She replied “what day were you planning?”.  I told her Friday, and she said “would Sunday work?”.  I said “sure sounds good 👍”.  She didn’t reply back to that.  I figured she may not be interested in going anymore, but why would she suggest another day (Sunday) if she wasn’t interested?  Does she think this is a date?  Think she’s even interested in going as friends?  She’s not using me cause I don’t have to pay for anything.  Her texting is throwing me off.

I wouldn’t mind it being a date, but I kinda prefer it being as friends.  Should I ask how her “date” went when I see her, or should I straight up and ask if we’re on a date?  Also, she has bad anxiety, so think that may have something to do with how she’s acting?

What’s up???",19Dec2019,1
3,"Been two years since I decided I did not like that I was an introvert and basically friendless except one friend who’s in the army. I learned to talk to people but never made any actual friends  along the way and I have no clue what I’m doing wrong. Perhaps it’s because I can’t get into that mood of making jokes. People my age tell me I don’t act like I’m their age and people below their age tell me I act older and the people who are older tell me I act very mature. 

Maybe it is because I’m not consistent in my behaviour and way of being? I don’t feel comfortable with everyone to express myself fully. How can I smash that barrier?",19Dec2019,1

8,"To start off I’m 16 and in 11th grade. Ever since high school started I’ve gotten treated really unfairly, my mom is a stay at home and only works on the weekends with my dad, majority of the time I have to do the chores. Cleaning around the house, tidying up the kitchen, tables, rooms, laundry and dishes. No one in the house does laundry except for me and my mom even though she’s stay at home, only ever rarely does house work such as moping the floor and cooking. My dad is present but nonexistent at the same time, he never speaks to me and he only does in rare occasions or to either yell at me for a stupid mistake or to do something. I have a younger brother and an older sister who don’t get treated like I do, no one is grateful for what I do at home and my parents never acknowledge me and my accomplishments when they treat my little brother like an angel. My mom yells at me for little things such as not giving food to my brother even though he refused to eat or not changing the dog pad and cleaning the cat litter (yes I also clean after the pets which my MOM got). 

During freshman year, I met my girlfriend who I’m still currently with. My mom didn’t like her and preferred me to get a white girlfriend, despite my girlfriend’s kindness, doing good in school and staying out of trouble, my mom still found her to be a “slut”. My girlfriend was allowed to come over to our home but every time she came over when they were there, they never acknowledged her and continued to stare at the tv, it made her uncomfortable so she started coming over when only me and my siblings were home. I was allowed to go out with her and her dad to dinner occasionally and her home. That all was eventually forbidden because I 1) did my homework on a Sunday after spending time with my girlfriend on a Saturday 2) because I accidentally asked her if I can on my dad’s birthday which I forgot about. It has worn out our relationship as we can’t go out and have fun together like normal teens or really, go out at all... 

My brother is spoiled to the core and my sister can still do whatever she wants to. My parents have high expectations of me in school even though they dropped out because they just didn’t want to work hard. My dad, I don’t even consider him a dad. For the past few years my mom has made my life miserable, shes lazy and she puts all her anger on me for no reason. If it weren’t for my girlfriend, I would’ve ended it all or ran away from home. I’m thinking to move in with my girlfriend and her dad, who’s more a dad to me than my real dad. What do you guys think?",19Dec2019,1
9,"**TLDR**

I’m 30/m, a career wildland firefighter, and live in a ski town in the western US. About 17 months ago, I got dumped by my fiance and she immediately started fucking one of her coworkers. I was crushed:( It’s taken a long time, but Im doing great now… but am still missing something. Finally, in the last few weeks I’ve realized that I must and will implement the following goals:

* Keep working out
* Move back in to a big party house with a bunch of longtime friends
* I’m going to go travel abroad next winter (12-13 months from now), because that’s why I got into this line of work in the first place.

These realizations/goals are incredibly powerful. I feel as if a weight has lifted off my shoulders. I had similar goals back when I was 21 and 22 and that’s how I got into this career. Setting and accomplishing those life goals had positive fallout for years! But eventually, the fallout kinda ran out and my life kinda nose dived… I think these \^ goals are achievable, in-line with what I want from life, and will again have positive repercussions for years to come.

\[Note: as a career wildland firefighter, I make about $60k between March and November, with full benefits, and then have December/January/February off)

**Now the long story…**

I graduated college in 2011. I didn't know much, but I knew that corporate America and the suburbs were not for me. So I headed out West, did a season of wilderness trail maintenance, then traveled abroad to Central America, then did my first season of wildland firefighting, then traveled again that next winter, then did a second summer of wildland firefighting, during which I met my Ex…

I met my Ex when I was 24. She was my dream girl: smart, pretty, funny, really fit, and outdoorsy… oh and the sex was amazing. I gave up traveling abroad in the winter for her, cuz she was broke and couldn't join me. I basically became domestic. I did my extreme job all summer, but had a steady girlfriend, rented a house where we both lived, eventually got 2 dogs, and finally got engaged.

But she was also a toxic bitch. Legitimately, she probably has a personality disorder and definitely has a family history of mental illness (probably partially why the sex was so good). I wont bore ya with the details, but we fought constantly for years, she spent in excess of $18k of my hard earned money in the last year were together alone, then she dumped my ass and within 2 weeks shacked up with her coworker… let’s be honest, they had probably already shacked up before we broke up:( That was in July 2018.

It’s been a rough go since, but steadily getting better. I’m now in phenomenal shape. I’m happy. My friendships have all improved. Work is going great and I make an above average wage for where I live… But I’ve been missing something.

And that’s what I’ve realized: I live by myself now and am still domestic, but at heart Im an adventurer. It’s why I do this job! But I also crave some stability (a stable place to live or at least a legal residence). Also, I dont have shit do to during the winter months. I live in a badass ski town out West, but dont ski or snowboard (I just dont okay?). So it’s kinda all hit me at once…

Renting my own apartment is too expensive and lonely. Furthermore, I only stay at my own place 6 months/year cuz Im gone fighting fire all summer, or hunting, or visiting family. But I want to keep my residence in my current town… so fuck it, I’m moving back in with all my buddies. We all do seasonal work. We’re all single. We all like to party, but no hard drugs. We can afford and want to have a big party house. So fuck it. That’s happening. It’ll save me an estimated $5k/yr in rent and $2-3k in bar tabs, because I meet these same friends at bars/breweries regularly in the winter cuz we’re all bored and sitting at home. Cut out the middleman, save $8k. Sounds good to me. Also, I've been considering this ""big party house"" since July 2019 and my friends have all recently agreed on it.

Now, I plan on using this $5-8k in savings for 2 things: 1) fully financing an emergency fund, which Ive been struggling to do for years. At first my Ex spent all my money, now my cost of living has gone up from living alone and going out a lot. 2) Go traveling!

I became a wildland firefighter as a means to ends… the ends being: living in badass tropical places in the winter, cuz fuck normal life in America and actually traveling is pretty cheap. But I havent traveled in almost 8 years… Last winter I couldn’t, I was just getting back on my feet, cuz the breakup didnt really hit me up after fire season wrapped up. This winter, I shouldve, but missed the proverbial boat (didnt book airfare far enough in advance). So next winter… Im gonna do it right. Earmark a couple grand, get cheap flights ahead of time, and just go. I don't ski/snowboad, so fuck it, Imma go chill on a beach, hangout at hostels, meet fellow travelers, go on adventures, etc. And then return to all my friends and a secure place to live whenever I want. Having a goal like this is key in wildland firefighting! It makes all the early mornings and days of brutal work much more palatable… the goal, the reward at the end. Ive been missing this for years.

And finally, fitness. Once I met my Ex, my dream girl… I let myself go. Not terribly, but I gained about 20lbs. BIG MISTAKE, but a fixable one. I’ve made a major return to the gym since the breakup and am now the strongest Ive ever been. It makes me feel great and makes me better at my job. Simply put: gotta continue this indefinitely.

So there it all is. I’m feeling good. I’ve set a few simple life goals for the next year. I’ll probably aim to live with my friends until I can save up $20k (in addition to an emergency fund) for a down payment on a house (3-4 years from now, age 35ish), but really homeownership is not very important to me. My overarching goal in life is simple: don’t die with regrets and dont die having lived a boring life.

Sorry if this all comes off as bragging, but I just wanted to tell someone!",19Dec2019,1

20,"So... I don't really know what happened, but I was 10. We were in the Florida Keys. Fishing on the boat, eating at restaurants, hanging on the beach. Sounds amazing?

For some reason, this turned in to a point in time where I found feet disgusting. They were everywhere. From that point on, I started covering. 

No one in my family would see my feet again. I stopped wearing sandals. I wore socks to bed. I vowed no one would see them. 

My mom re-married after she divorced my dad. He literally thought something was wrong because I wouldn't show my feet.

My grandma, mom, sister, whomever... they just know. And if anyone tries me... they tell them to stop talking about it. I've had people try to pull my socks off and my family steps in and says ""no"". I get super freaked out to the point of crying if someone does that.

The odd thing is that I'm ""okay"" with people seeing my feet- if they're not in my family or I met them later in life. Because they don't know my history of the issue and so they don't think it's a big deal if they see my feet. But I could NEVER let anyone in my family see them, because they know my history.

It sucks because I live in Florida USA and I can never be in sandals or flops around my family. Also we are planning a trip to Greece and I'm already trying to figure out what I will do around the pool and beach around my mom.

At least I see the potential in someone who has given up but is critical. Not giving up means continually being self-critical. Self-assured people have already given up. They are going to continue being who they are, because they have decided that they are enough.

And the great evils of humanity come from the people who profess that they are supreme, and who in turn receive the benefits of their confidence, however misplaced, because people admire what this false confidence says. It says that, while alive, there is an end to being self-critical and an end to the struggle that is being human, a magnificent finish line at the end of the race. But this is a lie that only the delusional or the malevolent can tell. And so the hopeful and critical people of the world are dashed asunder.

31,"Sorry it’s so long


I am 16 living at home in a very well off family. My mum was not raised Christian (Protestant) but found Christ though a friend at an early age. My dad was raised Christian. Our house is not filled to the brim with religious stuff and are family isn’t weird about it and try to convert everyone, we’re normal people. But we are still Christian. 

When I was little I was devoted(my parents promised the church to bring me up Christian) and we have been going to church ever since. If I wanted to grab lunch with one of my friends on Sunday, it’s to bad so sad for me. 

The problem is I’m not actually Christian. So the obvious thing to do is to tell them, which I did, about 3 years ago. I told them I wasn’t religious and didn’t want to go church anymore but they insisted I go anyways. They said if I wasn’t religious I shouldn’t be teaching in the Sunday school( I do this cause church is so boring and I know I’d be there anyways). So I kinda just shut up about all. But lately it’s been kinda eating me up.  

By the time i was 8 i was questioning my faith so my parents got me a bible book and started reading it to me every night for awhile but I never really believed in it after that. Both my sisters and parents are religious and my older sister was even baptized. 

It’s not supposed to be but I do feel pressure to make notions to god even just going to youth group( I been tried it and didn’t like the vibes) I have one friend who is so Christian and she rubs in everyone’s face and it makes me feel a little guilty for not being like that. 

In truth I’m a little scared to be Christian there’s a lot and you have to fully comment otherwise god spits you out. But I do want to be Christian, but I’m just not. I would love to carry around that feeling that someone is in control and that I’m ok but I just don’t believe. 

A friend of mine told  me (as i lie to everyone about being religious) “that you Christians don’t know what it’s like for someone to ask you why aren’t you Christian? And ask you to pray or share what your thoughts on biblical texts”I didn’t say much to him. But its easier for him, he can say, with out backlash, I’m an atheist. I can’t I’m expected to be Christian and to be able to pray and have a similar belief system. 

Though I know my friends opinions wouldn’t change of me if i told them they just would not understand. This isn’t like you were raised Christian but never went to church, or just on Christmas, and left the religion. Or that you went to church twice a month because even that’s not the same it’s not a full commitment. I definitely feel alone right now. Which is why I turned to the web as There are billions of people so I can’t be alone.

 I don’t really know what to do. Right now,
Regardless of what I say to them now they will continue to push me to be Christian and that will just be annoying.  And even if I tell them later on in life they would be so sad and and look back think what did we do wrong,? And I don’t know if i can handle that. I think I might just say I’m Christian but never/rarely go to church and pretend until they die. I just feel not good about all this and want some help.

Plus those white kids used to make fun of me, and call me the N word in a white suburban neighbourhood, plus i tried to tell my mother, she didnt care... yo i didnt even like my Toronto born ex from Portugal cuz he was too Canadianized for me. 

I actually wanted to say North America, but i dont wanna hurt my fellow Caribbeans and Hispanics and put them into this. 

I hate Canadians, because they try to be this fucking tolerant redneck ass country, but they are not. It’s all fake, and it’s just like America, except with free healthcare and more Native rights. It’s so cold, and the prime minister and all the white men up here are so fake they act tolerant (i say this because of the photo of Justin Trudeau doing Blackface), but are so racist against black women/men and middle eastern people and seem to only like women of color (hispanic , black , asian women, etc) due to stereotypes and stuff. (black women have big asses, asian women have tight p*ssies and are submissive, hispanic women have fiesty anger and have nice asses too... etc)

Americans are just horrible, they don’t have free healthcare, the dating culture with hookups and tinder and everything, is nasty. Just everything about that country is fucked up, i’m sorry. At least us Caribbeans chased away most of the white people out of our countries. They are just like the Canadians, but way worse.

39,"2019 is one of the most dramatic years of my life. So many ups and downs but I think I did well. 

Unpleasant events 

1) My parent's health

2) Stuck in a job where I don't belong

I broke down so many times due to work pressure, especially in September and November. I was like living in hell during those months. So much pressure in work and treated badly for the things I didn't do. I worked so hard and achieved a lot of things in the job but never be appreciated. But when it comes to the blame, I am the one to put. Just for the sake of money, I had to find a way to cope with my anger and sadness. The world was unfair to me in 2019 and I am still stuck in this toxic workplace. 

On the bright side

1) I got myself a spouse

2) I hit the gym regularly 

3) I learned  ""Not to worry about the things I can't control"" which is very difficult for me when I am carrying the weight of the world on my shoulder

Overall I think I did well for 2019. In 2020, there are a few things I want to do.

1) Improve my English especially in speaking (more articulately)

2) Change the job 

3) Try to live my life in the present as much as I can.

My friend asked me if I ever did or do something purely out of curiosity, for my own entertainment, without expecting to impress someone... And I fell into existential crisis. I can not think of a single thing.

Since childhood all of my actions are driven by calculations of how I can use it to impress someone or to just receive this ""wow! You can do this?"" and ""Great job"".

I'm naturally curious about everything but everything becomes a subject to excel in and impress someone with it. For the past hour I've been trying to imagine doing smth and not using it to receive feedback. It seems just pointless..

\*\*Background: SF (SemiFriend, 22M)\*\* is a roommate of \*\*CN (Childhood Neighbor, 22M)\*\*, and we all attend the same university. We're from the same hometown so the 3 of us hang out together, but that's usually me making plans with CN and he brings SF along as SF has little to no friends. Lately I've found myself distancing from SF (and thus, CN) because I simply cannot stand SF's life choices, out of irrational jealousy.

\*\*Story:\*\* The university we attend is one of those expensive ""trust-fund colleges"" whose student population mostly majors in Partying but enjoys an ridiculously prestigious reputation (read: extremely good career-prep resources) because almost everyone who attends is well-connected with suit-wearing daddies. I chose to attend this private school as my hometown has limited prospects for non-STEM careers, and also because my family can afford to essentially buy me a career path of my choice. 

Both of my parents grew up in \*extreme poverty\* and my dad never even made it past middle school. However through hard work, they are now multi-millionaires but that only happened when I was in my teens, so my siblings and I grew up relatively normal. My parents are frugal in all aspects except when it came to our education - as a kid I would get yelled at for spending my weekly allowance ($15) on secondhand novels instead of lunch but they were ok with splurging thousands of dollars on private tutoring to make sure we could salvage our shittiest grades. I took a year off after high school to take on apprenticeships but eventually decided to go college at my mother's insistence. 

I spent MONTHS researching on schools then finally mustered the courage to inform my parents of my decision. I very carefully laid out the pros &amp; cons and financing needed (4 years of tuition &amp; living expenses would total around $160k) and promised I would make the best out of it. We agreed that they would foot whatever costs I incur upfront, and I would repay them after graduation like a 0% interest loan. I applied and got in after submitting an appeal (I was rejected the first time).

CN and I have been friends for 10 years. He decided to apply for my college because he wanted to work in a similar industry and his high school was affiliated with it. CN's family is maybe only half as well-off as mine, but still financially-comfortable and his parents are a lot more loose with cash than mine are so the decision didn't seem OOC. CN got in, together with SF, his friend from high school, and they did everything together (house-hunt, picking classes, moving in etc). They're 2 years younger and also took time off after high school to ""find themselves"", so I was already in junior year when they became freshmen.

When CN first introduced me to SF, I didn't really mind or think much about him, except maybe their friendship came off as a little odd. CN and I are both very structured people - we're the types who NEVER go a week without doing the laundry or clean, we attend every single class religiously and a B grade is borderline anxiety-inducing. We're not scholarship-good by any means, but we're the kind of kids who will at least try to be the best at everything. 

SF is the complete opposite. He sometimes goes days wearing the same hoodie because he's out of clean clothes. He sticks to the minimum amount of credits every semester and yet still skips more classes than he attends. His grades are abysmal because he doesn't try at all. Now, this behavior isn't atypical for the ""trust fund kid"" culture at our college (after all, Daddy can just find them a job) and I usually don't bother concerning myself with the lives others but SF is an exception.

Because SF \*\*isn't\*\* a trust fund kid. 

He's the oldest of 5 siblings, his dad is a median-wage white collared employee and his mum is critically + chronically ill. I didn't know why, but I found myself \*\*fuming\*\* when I discovered this. SF only applied to our college because CN was going to as well. At least CN's choice had a couple of legit justifications - his family could afford it and he had a career-specific goal like me. SF picked a $160k degree he had absolutely no interest in pursuing at a school 12 hours away just because he \*\*doesn't want to live at home.\*\* His dad is drowning in debt to keep all of his kids in school and their mother alive, and all his lazy prick of a son does is whine about how \*""life is so fucking meaningless""\* (direct quote) and he's thinking about going to graduate school just so he can delay looking for a job. He depends on CN to kick his bedroom door down every semester just so he can wake up in time for finals. 

I started getting irritated at his mere presence after this discovery, to the point where I turned down invitations to hang out whenever I found out he was included. For the longest time, I wondered why I was always so exceptionally agitated whenever I ran into SF. Sure, he's lazy, but there are literally thousands of kids like him around campus. Why only him? Then I came to realise that this anger stemmed from jealousy within me. 

His high school GPA was \*\*literally half of mine\*\*, but he managed to get in with an unconditional offer simply because his high school was affiliated. At one point, I guess his financial cushion was thinning because he started asking around for easy internships/freelance gigs, which I refused to help him with. By virtue of dumb luck, SF managed to snag an internship with 0 effort because an acquaintance had a vacancy at his company and CN put in a good word to the acquaintance for him.

I was livid when I heard about the news. For most of senior year, I was only on campus once a week as I'd snagged a full-time, work-intensive internship at a famous international firm. But this was only possible bc I busted my ass clearing my credits for graduation by signing on the maximum number of classes for the first 6 semesters - and I only got the gig due to the   hundreds of hours I spend on studying just so I can have the best possible-looking transcript to pretty up my prospects. He got a job that pays $10/hour to fucking make coffee and copy documents without even trying. He eats out every single fucking day and splurges on game consoles while I stick to home cooking as much as possible so I can limit my spending to $5 a day. 

It just makes me so angry how someone could be so lazy and extravagant and selfish, and somehow have so many things land in their lap out of pure luck? CN tries to justify his behavior by pointing out SF has depression (like, actually professionally diagnosed) but I don't understand how anyone with SF's ultra privileged life with literally 0 expectations imposed upon them can be depressed. I know depression is a real problem and it can happen to anyone, but I can't see it in a guy who yo-yo's all the fucking time between ""man, I feel bad for my dad,"" and ""I hope I can stay in college forever ugh why do I have to work.""

I'm supposed to be the \*actual\* trust fund kid, but my life has been the exact opposite of his. Due to my our strict family culture, and my parents' overachieving natures, there were several points in my life where I failed to meet their expectations and turned suicidal because I just simply couldn't cope with trying then failing to live up to them. Even now, after I'm done with college with a job I love and made it through like I promised my parents - I still have a $160k debt on my shoulders that makes me panic sometimes. A lot of times I feel like an underachieving piece of shit - if my blue collar parents could be multimillionaires, I should be Zuckerberg 2.0 right now with all of the financial support and opportunities I've been given. 

I never sought counselling, but fortunately no longer cut myself and learnt to convert that frustration into drive to do better. Which goes back to my opinion that SF's ""depression"" is an outright excuse for spoiled laziness. And because I think it's not real, I get even angrier about it bc I think this masquerade is an insult to true sufferers of depression who have legitimately distressing lives.

Most days I don't even remember SF exists, because our lives hardly intersect anymore. But any occasional mention or sight of him (we still run in mutual circles bc CN brings him around) and my blood boils. I turn into a passive aggressive person around him. He's never been rude or unpleasant towards me, but somehow the obnoxiousness of his lifestyle makes me angry. I suppose that I'm the genuinely obnoxious one for being so petty about something that doesn't even affect me, but I honestly don't know how to switch it off. At the darkest point in time when all of this was happening, I fantasized about his father going bankrupt just so I could go up to him and rub it in his face tha he deserved nothing he had in his life and good riddance that he doesn't get to do it anymore. I'm so embarrassed of myself because I'm literally a bitter old boomer over such a ridiculous irrelevant non-situation like this.

53,"I've had a strange relationship with suicide over my adult life. It has at times been a notion I've recoiled from in horror, and at other very painful times it felt like the only choice I had.

But as my mental health has become a little more stable, I have come to a place where it isn't something I want to do, but feels like a viable Plan B. If everything in my life goes terribly wrong, at least I can just kill myself.

When I sit around thinking about all the ways my life could be ruined, it gives me peace. What if my husband died suddenly and I couldn't cope with the grief? What if I lose all my money and become homeless? What if I become paralysed? What if I accidentally killed someone in a car accident, was convicted of dangerous driving, and had to spend the rest of my life in prison? 

Then a little voice in the back of my head says: ""Don't worry, if all of that happens you can just kill yourself."" 

With that small thought, I immediately feel at peace. There's a plan in place, a self-destruct mechanism, a big red button that can get me out of even the worst possible situation.

I have no desire to commit suicide now, but I do see it as the way I will eventually die. When I'm old and frail, when I have no close family left and no pets depending on me, and I'm coming to the end of my independence, I'd like to be able to bow out gracefully. I would like to choose my last day and what I do with it, whether I have a big party with my friends, take a solitary walk by a lake and watch the sun set, or binge on pizza, ice cream and my favourite TV shows.

I see at as a way of taking control over my own destiny, choosing how and when I go, and limiting the amount of pain I'll have to endure in my life. To me that is beautiful, not tragic.

The only choice in my mind is the timing. I would prefer a dignified end to a happy, long life. I would prefer not to cause too much collateral damage to the people around me, by waiting until they're all gone themselves. But I can always bring that day forward if my life goes way off the rails and I need to escape.

The future terrifies me. It feels like a vast dark chasm that could bring immeasurable joy or unbearable suffering. Having very little control over it makes me so uneasy, so it comforts me to know that if I don't want to play the game any more, I can always quit.",19Dec2019,1

Being a kid was awesome, but I feel I didn’t have the proper socializing experience a kid should have. My Mom was very lenient, and didn’t punish me for most things kids would get punished for, and it showed. I didn’t have the best common sense growing up, and I kind of learned the hard way from a lot of people. As a young kid that can make you feel pretty inferior. 

The older I got, the more introverted and insecure I became. I was just so tired of being the “dumb” kid with no common sense. I really tried my best to still fit in. It was exhausting. On top of that I was a horrible student. I would always lie about my grades to people because I didn’t want them to think I was dumb. 

I was so insecure. Always having to put on a mask just to fit in at school. It truly made my high school experience unenjoyable, and made me very depressed and anxious at the time. I just hated socializing. 

I just turned 20. I’ve been out of high school for 2 years now and I still haven’t figured out what I want to do with myself. I live at home with my parents and work a shitty fast food job.

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me.

This school is just... 76% is the great mark and 90% is ""impossible"". So I have been getting what is considered by my parents and other schools. Bad marks. In my school, getting an A or B is amazing but my parents think that every school is the same and that 30 years ago has no different to tomorrow (they keep saying when I was your age I got A+ in everything). I am on par with the students in my school, but all this talk that I will with such grades... that I am a failure is just devastating. When I asked my teacher about my grades, he says I am doing great, but to them I failed.

While I tend to not care much about my parents view in my study, it's too much that not just my parent but me too, when seeing the marks I would get last year and my friends at my old school, that I am a failure.

59,"Hey guys, this is just a rant. You don't need to read/respond if you don't want to.

I have fallen into a depression that has ruined my 2019. I have zero motivation or willpower which has impacted my life in two ways:

a) My grades at school have been awful, and I need to get an A\*A\*A at the end of the year if I want to study the course I love (all courses are similar grades from AAB-A\*A\*A\* for Physics). I don't think I can raise my grades to this level, and consequently, I won't get into University. Everyone else in all my classes is getting A's and I'm the only one struggling, I feel like a fraud as I got 9's (A\*'s) at GCSE but am now getting E's. I have no motivation to change this.

b) I have had no motivation to improve myself (including my grades). I have so many aspects of myself that I need to improve, and I don't have the willpower to do anything at all.

To stifle my disappointment in myself, I have been comfort-eating for the whole year, gaining 10kg within a few months. Not only do I now have horrendous stretch marks, but my whole wardrobe is now too tight to look nice on me. I have spent most of my year trying to starve myself which hasn't worked at all and only ended up with binging that made me gain even more weight. 

I depend on self-love for happiness. I cut my hair to pixie-cut-length on impulse in March and I have hated it ever since I got it done, it has absolutely screwed my self-confidence and I loathe the way I look every day. To add to this, my skin has been disgusting even though I've been taking ridiculous care for it and been prescribed antibiotics.

I gave up my favorite sport to focus on school and that helped me get fat. If I go back to it now I will be incredibly weak and it's humiliating to have to spend months being terrible at it as I was once amazing. Plus the sport is only fun when you can do the most difficult parts, the easy stuff is incredibly boring; I never do anything I love anymore. All I do is count calories, cry about my grades, and wish I was pretty.

Essentially, I have spent the year wallowing in self-pity instead of actually *doing something* *about it* and I am scared that this is going to be my life forever because I have zero motivation to change. I hate that there are so many people with way worse problems and I can't get past a little extra weight and some bad test scores. Depression is slowly ruining my life.

Enough is enough. I need to actually live and not just survive. So I did it, I found a casual gaming event to go to and I'm going to force myself in to it. I may end up having a panic attack and have to leave early but it feels like a big step that I'm committing myself to something and I am feeling good about that. 

It probably won't lead to a friendship but it's a step I should have  taken a long time ago and at least I'm doing it now.",19Dec2019,1
62,"On the moon of Europa, covered in layers of ice, with a vast ocean underneath, there exists a small population of large, octopus like creatures. While being autonomous, they do not maintain an illusion of individuality. They communicate simply, by sharing thoughts.They occasionally meet for small discussion about this or that in the surrounding areas.
“Have you seen Earth these days? Have you seen what the humans have done?” said the octopus. Yes, said a octopus. It is a tragedy born of conditions. “Conditions are not an excuse.” No, but we must have empathy, they taught us that, said a octopus. The octopus considered this, and replied, “Empathy means nothing when their world is ending and ours is not.”
A octopus replies, their condition should give you empathy, imagine being that hopeless. The octopus could not understand, “Why feel anything for a being so self destructive? Why go through the motions of feeling emotion for something that does not feel empathy for itself?”
A octopus simply said, you made my point.",19Dec2019,1

65,"I am very analytical about myself, especially my flaws. Its easy for me to see where in life I am coming up short, but I have either no drive, or no idea how to better those parts of me. Mostly socially. 

An example of missing drive would be; I struggle with conversations. Finding the right words to say, how to convey my thoughts eloquently, how to carry a conversation longer than a few back-and-forths. I figure I could remedy this by reading more, but I have no desire to do so.

An example of not knowing how would be that I am very sociable and get along well with people on a surface level. Exchanging pleasantries, asking how things are going, etc etc are easy. But I struggle to form a deeper connection with practically anyone. I feel like I don't know what to ask or how to respond to deep questions. It also doesn't help that my memory is terrible and I often forget what someone's said, even minutes after they've said it. 

All of these things, hand-in-hand, make it very hard to form deep personal connections with people. It hasn't caused a problem for me yet (except the memory part), but I foresee that it has the potential to leave me feeling alone and isolated.",19Dec2019,1
66,"Here’s some back story, we’ve dated about 4 years now, and all was good until around March this year. I was unfaithful as I would give my snap to random girls in hopes for more attention and it was the worst mistake of my life. 

I never actually fell through with it, but it was that I attempted to twice, and lied about it the second time that I think really hurt her.

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, we had a fight because I didn’t want to go over to her place after work (which I also regret), this lead to a huge fight and into a break to which she wanted to revisit things in the new year, as she felt hurt still about what I’ve done.

3 days ago, she came over and broke things off with me. She said that she doesn’t see herself being happy if we were to get back together. I told her that she was wrong and that I think we are a perfect match for each other. I said that we’ve been through so much together and that I could get us couple counselling. But she didn’t want that she said she doesn’t want to be with anyone until she’s finished school (2 years from now).

Yesterday she moved all her things out, and I’m going to bring the rest tomorrow.

But I am SO hurt... I love this girl, I’ve never loved a girl the way I love her. You know, we were suppose to move in together this summer. I thought I was going to end up marrying this girl. It feels like half of my soul is consistently missing and whenever I do something I just want to tell her. She’s my best friend after all.

Since the breakup I’ve barely ate anything, I can’t. And when I sleep I dream about her and her family, which inevitably wakes me up in tears. I cry so hard some times that I puke, I just don’t know what to do. I have a counselling appointment booked for the 24th and a Doctors appointment booked for the 8th. 

I just wish I had could take it all back. Another thing is that we have a cat together and when I told her that she could have him (it’s her cat), she said she didn’t want him because her roommates allergic and that she would send him up for adoption. She later texted me and said she was just upset and wouldn’t put him for adoption. And then when she was moving her stuff out, I brought it up again and she said that she loves him so much and that she doesn’t even want to pet him because it hurts so much. I love him to death too, but should I give him back?",19Dec2019,1

70,"Hello Reddit! I've been a long time lurker here, just recently turned 18 and in my third semester of my bachelor's in computer science. I've always been passionate about IT and ComSci, but I have a huge problem of procrastination. Being especially passionate about Cybersecurity, but falling off the curve in comparison to others, hurt my chances multiple times so far.

Every once in a while, I start off with a motivated spirit, inspired enough to crack 10-15 competitive programming problems at once. I start preparing for certifications, I set study plans, and eventually within a week I find myself slacking off all day.

Now that I think about it, being from India, I read reports and news on the daily about there being a lack of skilled professionals in cybersec in India. The year-over-year salary and demand rate has been drastically rising, but there is not enough of it being taught anywhere to counter it.

I came up with a solution to counter my laziness and hold myself accountable, all while also catering to the lack of cybersec learning. I think I want to do a quick little podcast or video series everyday (maybe of ten minutes) just talking about all that I learned and all the news I read on that day, related to the field.

TL:DR, I want to document my journey into the world of Cyber Security by doing a 10min podcast or video everyday, of everything that I learn on said day (news or concepts). This will help me be accountable to myself and to my viewers, and also give me motivation that doesn't die down easily unlike before.

I want to grow and learn everyday, but I'm just not sure if this idea would be ideal or not. As long as it doesn't backfire, I guess!",19Dec2019,1

75,"A couple weeks ago we got the talking out of the blue, and she invited me to her birthday get together.  I went, and afterwards she texted me “Thanks sooo much for coming!! I’ve missed you and hope to hang again soon !”.  Later I posted a selfie we took and captioned it “happy birthday”. She reposted it and added a heart (❤️).

Since she wanted to hang out, this past Saturday I asked her if she wanted to go to a Christmas themed amusement park this weekend (where we used to work together). She said “YES, what day?”. I offered two days, and she said “let me check my calendar”, but she never got back to me. 

Yesterday I was gonna ask if she still wanted to go, then I saw what she posted on her IG story. It was a video of her wearing two different shoes captioned “hypothetically if you were me going on a casual date, which shoes would you wear?”.   I assume she is/was going on a date with another guy... but was she talking about me? I doubt she was talking about me since she hadn’t even agreed to a day/time.

Sooo... I decided to text her “Hey, did you still wanna go to (park name) this weekend? If you’re busy it’s cool”.  She replied “what day were you planning?”.  I told her Friday, and she said “would Sunday work?”.  I said “sure sounds good 👍”.  She didn’t reply back to that.  I figured she may not be interested in going anymore, but why would she suggest another day (Sunday) if she wasn’t interested?  Her texting is throwing me off.

Also, she has bad anxiety, so think that may have something to do with how she’s acting?  

I was looking forward to it, but now I don’t know.  It doesn’t even seem like she’s into it, but if she didn’t wanna go wouldn’t she just say she was busy?  Or is it my mind playing tricks on me?  Do you think she was talking about me on her IG story?  I’m not sure if she thinks it’s a date or not.

Should I offer to pick her up, or is that weird?  It would be out of the way to pick her up, but if it’s a date I’d prefer to pick her up.  Should I just ask her if she’d like me to pick her up or meet there?  I’m just planning on texting her Sunday what time I’ll get there.  Or should I figure out a time sooner?

76,"In a group of peers, we were trying to have a discussion instead of a debate. Somehow, one of the persons got offended and called my buddy a xenophobe, transphobe, sexist, racist, and expletive curse-words.

78,"it has been about 5 years now since i first thought of being one. Small, cute, kind and gentle. But i brushed it off...

I have always been sensitive. (i cried to most of the movies i watched that had sad scenes.)
I am more comfortable talking to girls than guys.(but i don't really attracted men)

My thoughts are in shambles. I imagined, if i were a girl, every problem that i face would completely disappear. I would have purpose and live life to the fullest. I would study hard and be the best there is. I would travel around the world, explore everything there is to know.

And every now and then i would be a small burrito sitting on a couch, watching cartoons. drinking hot coco. during light winter storm.

89,"  As a struggling Ph.D. student, it was hard to be optimistic or have positive self-esteem and self-confidence. The constant fear of failing the degree, imminent joblessness, inherent lack of accomplishments, poor knowledge and loneliness gnawed at me constantly.

However,   I did get my degree last month and my Ph.D. supervisor offered me a Post-doctoral fellow position.  This has created a shift in my brain.   Now, I have realized that over the past half-decade, I have been obsessively thinking negatively about myself. All this self-deprecating behaviour and negative self-talk created a dismal picture of the future for me. I have taken a stand that this can't be entertained anymore. I  have achieved an accomplishment that was very important to me, and I  should rejoice that. I should look towards the future as an opportunity, no matter what comes my way. I need to address any shortcomings as an opportunity and not as a failure.

On a personal level, 

* My first goal is to get healthy. I have started intermittent fasting and regular exercise. I will reach my weight goal in a month and a half. Already down 3.5 Kgs in a month.
* My second goal is to practice meditation seriously. I am striving for a calm and composed mind.
* My third goal is to be more social and develop a positive image during conversations with strangers.

Finally,  I hope that when I do get the job that I want, I would be in my best shape mentally, physically and spiritually to perform in the best possible way.  The same goes for finding a relationship to cherish.

95,"When I was young I was an exponentially smart kid. I was speaking sentences by the time a normal kid was learning to speak. I was offered collage classes by 3rd grade. My mom refused becuase she didn't want me to be overwhelmed. This went on till 5th grade, when my mom became terminally ill. She had a weak heart and had a few heart attacks before, but it was determined terminal when her body started refusing potassium. It put to much stress on her body and her heart has a hard time keeping up. This triggered something in my dad and he became a serious hypochondriac. He kept self medicating and became severely bipolar ( he was already pretty violent but this made it much worse). He ignored all moms problems, he quit his job, and this is where it all went down hill. He started getting violent with me and my siblings, with only our mom to stop him from hitting us. He would call me a useless lazy peice of s***, that I  would amount to nothing and stuff like that  multiple times a day(thats not acnolaging the stuff he told me during his spurts of anger). Since he quit his job we were often eating the same stuff for weeks at a time, potatoes, ramen, and rice. The only protein coming from school lunches. He'd often treat himself to steaks, pork chops and  sweets right in front of us. (This is where it started to affect my schooling) I developed bad anger issues and clinical depression. I took up football and wrestling to keep my mind off stuff. I was a natural at both anxiety kept me from doing state wrestling. When I was home it was straight to videogames. Any time to my own thought we're hell. (At about this time it was middle of 6th grade sorry for the lack of time updates) I lost lots of sleep I didn't do my homework becuase I was always distracted. My grades dropped I kept getting yelled at for it. My dad was putting more and more stress on mom. I didn't do football and wrestling in 7th grade becuase just the thought of performing in public gave me anxiety attacks. Finally just after 8th grade ended my mom and dad seperated. Due to years of depression and lack of sleep my memory became very selective. I was at about a little below average in my grades. Slowly I started to heal our money situation got better. I was going to rejoin football (the head coach bought me a ps4 to bribe me into it). At this time i was still very athletic, becuase my dad made me costantly cut fire wood and it sometimes go haying. Then at the worst possible time i got sick. I got very sick. I contracted mono which is pretty common and not much to worry about. Except in very rare cases like mine. I couldn't stay awake for more then 3 hours my spleen and kidney were swollen to the point that someone bumping into me could burst them. Due to the constant sleeping the little time i was awake was just constant migranes. This went on for 6 months I had troubled lifting a gallon jug. I had to take a skip year, but I decided to convince my mom to let me just get my G.E.D. and forget high school. I passed really fast since I at least had the basics of each subject down. That was about a month ago. I'm 16, I have regained my strength and more, I'm preparing for collage, I got passed my depression, my memory is getting better, and things are a lot calmer in the house.

97,"I've always found myself skimming through reddit posts over the years about different things that people are dealing with. I am not exactly sure what I was drawn to. Maybe it was to see that no matter how badly I thought I was doing in life, there were always people who were dealt a worse hand. That may have helped ease some of the difficult times. Not once did I think I'd ever be so lost, helpless, and alone that I'd end up creating an account just so I can get advice from strangers over the internet.

But here I am. 

To summarize the past few years since high school: Had a career-altering injury that made me lose my athletic scholarship, dealt with the death of my grandfather and cousin within a very short time frame, dropped out of university because my parents were both dealing with health issues that made them take a break from working, have had nasty bouts of depression and self-harming thoughts along with constant anxious breakdowns. 

I started to do a lot better for myself recently. I got a job doing corporate sales and was making a good paycheck that I was using towards paying off the credit card bill I had racked up for my mom in the past year. She lent it to me to spend a bit on myself for courses and certifications that would help me. But unfortunately for a few dental issues and other circumstances, I ended up spending a lot more. I was fired 4 weeks back just before the holiday season and it has been really tough finding a job during this time period. Well today the credit card bill came in and it has racked up to $15,000 with the minimum of $1000 due on the 29th. My mom is already dealing with severe heart health issues and if she gets any hint of this it would break her. I am so grateful for my parents and I love them to death, I cannot believe how badly I f\*cked them over with this stupid stupid error. 

Family over everything and my parents have always told me I can count on them to pull me through any situation. Unfortunately, I already know everything about their financial situation and I know there isn't anything they can do for me. They are already taking care of my younger siblings as well. I feel like the worst piece of sh\*t on the planet. I feel worthless and have hit rock bottom. The moment I saw that bill I started shaking and immediately felt my body just collapse. I've contemplated doing the absolute worst things to come up with the money but ultimately its not in my character, i cant stoop that low. Although when you feel suicidal and have feelings of self-harm its much easier to fall down the wrong pathways. 

Basically I am absolutely f\*cked. I can't realistically get hired anywhere until after new years. Then for a first paycheck we're looking at anywhere from mid to end of January.  I can't really take out a loan as I have piss poor credit from younger years and there's no proof of employment. How would you guys approach this situation? I need some advice so I don't completely lose my mind and ruin my life. Any practical advice for the situation? I still cannot believe that I'm in such a bad position that I need advice from complete strangers on a public forum just to keep me from running onto the freeway butt naked smh",19Dec2019,1
98,"I know that’s not true but it feels very true. She keeps testing me or playing tricks or mind games or trying to get under my skin. She has she belief that I am some judgmental person, bad with money, and stuck up. Anything I tell her something to be nice or honest like when I compliment how nice her home looks since I knew she was super cleaning it for guests. She immediately defends herself and tells me that she always cleans her house and it’s weekly thing. When I had to live there temporarily when I looked for an apartment I went and bought light bulbs and a lamp because they had white light and it gave me headaches and made 10pm seem like 4pm. Anyways she was super weird about it. Like it was the biggest deal. When I visit my childhood home, I use the upstairs bathroom because old habits and she was weird about it- as if the downstairs bathroom is not good enough for me. I am getting married soon- will be a very small wedding. She keeps trying to push weird online stores that sale knockoffs. I tried to tell her that it’s sketchy and I might not get the dress in the picture - she dismissed me and told me it’s so much cheaper and I can use her card for it. She knows I wouldn’t do that since it will go against my beliefs. I can’t just do that to my mom  or anyone knowing that it is a scam. 

I have tried explaining to her why I do what I do (ex use the upstairs bathroom) so she knows I am not judging her.  I am trying to be calm around her and more easy going - I know I have a “not so fun” personality for example I don’t drink  which apparently means I judge everyone that does (not true). I dress simple but that makes me boring. It doesn’t help that my sisters might as well be the “Kardashians”I can go on and on. I am just confused why she thinks so negatively of me.

I’m a good person to flake on because I usually don’t care too much about it, but this time it’s my 20th birthday, I gave everyone a heads up weeks in advance, and I set it around the time everyone said they would be free. It makes me feel as if no one actually cares at all, like I have no true friends who will be there for me.

New friends are easy to come by, it’s becoming good friends and having someone that you trust that’s the hard part.  I’m just really upset tbh :////",19Dec2019,1

I’ve made no friends there due to my severe anxiety, I’m so lonely and sad and I’m starting to think I deserve it. I’m dreading going back and just want to stay in my bed although I feel like I don’t belong at home with my family either. I can’t seem to find any motivation and I’m seriously starting to consider the fact that I would be better off dead if it meant I could stop feeling so depressed.",19Dec2019,1
101,"Growing up I had always hated cats (if anything, I’d call myself a dog person), It was mostly for things I grew up believing (i.e. cats are violent, they may scratch you, dogs are loyal pets and cats are meh). Also, I would be frightened and grossed out by them, especially how their tail just moves on its own like a snake (it made me squeamish).

But when I grew older I was influenced to adopt two cats and later a kitten, whom I lived with nearly two years collectively and during this period I realized what it means to have a cat’s affection.

Now when I ever see a cat in anyone’s household and it approached me, it makes me so happy. I still love dogs and no doubt they are the most loyal pets. But everything about a cat’s personality, see, I read this somewhere a few days ago, “Dogs come when they’re called; cats take a message and get back to you later” - says a lot.",19Dec2019,1
102,"I seriously can’t take it with all these people supporting this stuff. I’d like to respond with a fun Facebook status update using Trumps own words:

“Listen, you “motherfuckers”, I’m gonna “move on you like a bitch”,  “grab you by the pussy”, “try and fuck you”, and then ship you off to “shithole countries”.   If you would like to apply, I’m now interviewing for 2nd &amp; 3rd husbands, as well as porn stars and playgirl models to have sex with, while still being married.   I’m excited to get started since this “bullshit” is all now condoned and accepted by evangelical Christians! Woo hoo!”",19Dec2019,1
105,"If you are going to buy or try and return anything made by HP, be careful. If for some reason you lose the proof or purchase or receipt, you are out of luck. Also if you buy anything made by HP and it isn't from the right place the warranty is void. Anything second hand has zero warranty, unlike Apple, whose AppleCare can actually be transferred. There is a reason HP is HP and Apple is who they are.

So again, the chat support may say one thing and the email people may say another. May the Buyer beware from HP.",19Dec2019,1
112,"I (19F) live in a really small town and went to the dollar store today and when I walked in and went down an aisle they were saying ""she's kind of a loner"" and ""she's always with her mom"" which I am because I live with her and have a lot of social issues, I guess. But I'm trying to work on them and I was already having a bad day and it just hurts that people see me like that. I've had some shitty situations and a lot of isolation happen in the last couple years so I missed out on a lot of social development stuff. Honestly, I didn't know where to post this. People tell me I just need to go outside more and just talk to people, which I try. I mean if I go to a store or something, there's not really any clubs or classes or anything here under $100. But even just being around people makes my stomach hurt. I'm pretty sure I need some mental help but there's nothing here and it's an hour to get anywhere else. The town is surrounded by steep passes and our car has really bad motor mounts and bald tires, so we can't make it down the passes because if something happened there's not even service out there. I can't get a ride with anyone, I can't try reaching out online because it's still too expensive. I didn't finish high school, I want to get my ged but again I can't get to the test center. And I have trouble studying for the test because I can't focus very well and it's hard to comprehend stuff. I just feel stupid and awful and I just needed to rant because I have no one to talk to. I can't stop having nightmares and headaches I think because of stress. My mom is an alcoholic who is drinking more because I don't have a job or any friends. And I want a job but I'm so painfully awkward and slow I don't want to just get fired and that's why I quit my last job because I couldn't handle talking to customers. I thought about getting into car accidents and just ending it rather than having to go. I can't stop having nightmares and headaches over the friends I used to have and people leaving and hating me. I have no one to talk to, and when someone tries to talk to me I shut them out and just ghost them and it makes me feel awful. I want to just go to sleep and not wake up. I feel so stupid and ugly and weird and I've always felt this way, but not as bad until the last couple years.",19Dec2019,1

115,"Like right now. Always checking something, looking at some funny stuff, just watching youtube videos.. consuming without creating, and I always have been the “creator” type but ever since my life went to shit I don’t create anything, still get the urge but it gets lost quickly and when I realize I wasted another way without creating anything.

It’s like an endless loop of shit. I’m so tired of it.",19Dec2019,1
