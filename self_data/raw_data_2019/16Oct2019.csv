3,"I was an ice cream man for a season. Everybody loved me and I would even get tips! People would come out when it was pouring rain or even when it was cold. I had a lot of loyal customers and got to know them and their families on a first name basis. They knew who I was and they knew who I was. I would always cut it off at dusk, just because there was was just no way around that being sketchy.

I only had trouble once, when I ALMOST got robbed the one time I went into a neighborhood I never drove into just because they never had any money. Plenty of kids, but never any money, or adults around for that matter.

There was one guy that flagged me down and started going bonkers ordering whatever this crowd of about 10-15 kids wanted. It was mostly bubble gum and sodas and it was fine until they started grabbing the stuff and walking off before he had paid. This became problematic as I proceeded to tally up the total for him. I cut it off and said this is what just went out the window, this is how much you owe, and he started getting angry because he wasn’t going to get what he wasn’t finished ordering. It was about $10 worth of bubblegum and soda and he wanted to argue about it, meanwhile I hadn’t seen any money or even a wallet in his hand. He started yelling and cursing and I hopped in the driver’s seat and drove off. 

When you’re the ice cream man, you’re king of the hood. What you says goes, and people will vouch and fight for you. It really felt good being the hero to so many kids. I felt really sad when I’d see the sad faces of my loyal customer kids peering out the window when I drove by. I was a kid once too, so I know there was a reason they couldn’t have ice cream that day. I wouldn’t go back to that though!",16Oct2019,1

Almost 23 years old…the laughing stock of a nation",16Oct2019,6

I'm a 23 year old male and I just lost my virginity yesterday. I never would have thought this was possible before.

For the past nine years I've been in the Incel community, long before it had any media attention. But my problems with sexuality stretch before that. I have Asperger's syndrome and I was also abused in my early childhood to mid adolescence, both by family and by teachers. To my knowledge nothing sexual happened, but mental health professionals did look into whether something sexual happened. I didn't have the social skills to seek help and I developed a lot of self loathing from it, specifically having the idea that I somehow couldn't have sex because of my lack of social skills. I repressed my sex drive a lot over the next nine years and for quite a time saw sex as completely off the table for me. I am lucky to be fairly physically attractive, I learned in hindsight that many girls had been interested in me but had seen me as unavailable. I went through phases of ""looksmaxxing"" and trying to find relationships on various dating apps and sites but I never got anywhere since I never challenged my core attitudes. But since finding [r/sex](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/) I've become a lot more open and accepting of my sexuality. I don't want to be a ""Chad"", I just want to act on my desires, either by myself or with another person. After introspection about my desires I decided to join the kink community since they value this type of openness. It was very quick, only about a week for me to find a woman willing to take my virginity. She was older and much more experienced, and made the experience very good for me. Although we met in the kink community this encounter was fairly vanilla since I didn't want to be overwhelmed by things like bondage for my first time, she seemed really happy with the experience too which was a very pleasant surprise. We used protection and it didn't harm the experience. I'm now looking to have my first same sex encounter as I've always been a little bicurious. I'm really happy I found the sex positive community as it has drastically improved my life. I also played the final fantasy victory theme after I lost my virginity.

9,"The ""Mind over Matter"" or ""it's all in your head"" and optimistic ""You can do anything with the right mindset"" mindset is all well and good. But I feel like it's very childish and naive. That's not something you can say to a war vet with severe PTSD, which is triggered quite often by random unrelated things, therefore it proves that there are things you simply can't overcome by pretending you can. Saying that mind over matter makes you limitless is, unfortunately, delusional. I don't mean to be a downer, nor am I saying you shouldn't make an honest effort to overcome all obstacles. But asking for help and recognizing a weakness or a wall you simply can't overcome by yourself isn't lacking personal responsibility, it isn't being weak. It's strength. It's true that in the west tons of people don't eve try and can't take responsibility for their own lives, and its cancerous to our society. But you also need to recognize that you can have the whole ""you're just blaming something or someone instead of dealing with your own internal problems"" mentality but eventually you'll hit a wall and encounter something that completely breaks you and destroys that mindset, then you realize that you too are subject to human weakness. I don't have anger or spite for people who think that way, all I'm saying is they won't understand until their spirits get shattered by something outside their reasonable control, and that's not their fault that's just how it goes.",16Oct2019,7

And that's not even mentioning brain damage from pitocin, which causes reduced transplacental blood flow and net reduced cerebral perfusion in the infant from repeated rapid spikes in blood pressure due to the mother's contractions, AND tries to use its head like a battering ram through a birth canal that is not prepared. Or vitamin K, which increases the viscosity of the blood of that little infant that just got asphyxiated when its cord was clamped, its little heart beating away at 200bpm. And you increase its viscosity. With something that also contains aluminum.

17,"My little brother (M20) has struggled with depression for years. However, in the past month it has really come to a head and he was hospitalized for 4 days for suicidal thoughts. Since then he has been home with my parents, but he hasnt been back to work and says that he thinks about suicide every day. He is undergoing outpatient therapy 3 days a week and says he feels better after therapy, but gets worse on days without it.

I dont live at home, so I see him about once a week. I saw them all yesterday, and after I left he admitted to my parents that ""I love (me), but I dont have anything to say and it's just so hard making small talk"". I've been inviting him to my apartment for the past two weeks to spend the night and hang out but he hasnt responded at all, and I suppose this is why. Im okay with not seeing him as much if that helps, but Im not sure if it would. I feel like him isolating himself from work, then me, and my parents wont help anything.

I've started texting him in the evenings and I say that he doesnt have to respond, but that I'm thinking of him. I then usually send him a bunch of memes from pages that we both always enjoyed. I hope it doesnt annoy him. I just want to make him happy.

18,"**Abusive MOM**

On labor day, last week (October 9th), my mom was extremely abusive and I had no idea why. I had no cell phone to call, no computer and no internet, because

My mom was CRAZY angry (for no apparent reason), and she just decided to  kick, slap and punch me  at the very same day. I didn't know what to do at the time, because I had no internet, and my dad took all my electronics away on purpose, so I didn't have to get access. I have told my teacher, but they don't really care on what I have been going through.

 My mom used a pair of metal tongs, and she would beat me up with them, whenever she got annoyed with me. She would pull my hair and curse all the time. She also uses a field hockey stick. On Wednesday, she banged  it really hard on the table, and said from her mouth ""this would be a good way to hit you."", and then she would be laughing. My mom hit me with with the field hockey stick too, and I started crying, because I didn't know what to do.

My mom doesen't agree with grounding, and has been in trouble with CPS, she also has a bad reputation , (due to recent abusive times with me and my mom, and the gossip that people spread.)

&amp;#x200B;

(I blame my mom's mom for the way she is today.  I understand that my mom grew up super poor in her country, and she decided to marry my dad, and live as immigrants in our new country.  My mom was NEVER disciplined when she was young, and has lived her life pretty spoiled.)

19,"Can someone give me advice? I'm having a hard time right now... Basically I just haven't been feeling well for a couple years. I'm a sophomore right now and i didn't think that it would be this hard on my life already. First off I'm going to be going to therapy soon already but we're waiting for next year for our insurance, I thought I could wait a bit longer but i'm becoming very frustrated. I have been getting really angry recently and then i get angrier because of me getting angry, sometimes any little noise or something just touching me makes me want to burst into tears, it's been happening at least once a week now, but i think me getting angry in general everyday is bothering me more, I really don't mean to..

I also have a hard time speaking to others which had been VERY hard on me, Its so frustrating to me that i'm not living out my high school life to the fullest like everyone else around me. I've been getting unbearably jealous to those around me. I have people to sit next to in most of my classes, but whats the point if i can't talk well to them? I have been feeling so lonely, I just want to be close to people but my skills are lacking, my friend I've known since 2nd grade has been leaving me for her boyfriend and more popular people, i went to a mutual friends party just to be left alone at a table and have my mom pick me up early ( i am getting to know some really nice artsy people now to that's cool).  I'm friends with this girl who i like very much, I don't know why but i am getting tired of hanging out with her, It's not like i hate her but maybe i need more time? I don't know, i'm probably being selfish right now. I've been coming up with excuses not to hang out but i really don't want to, what do i say to her? Is it just being rude?

My parents think i'm being dramatic, that i put myself into a situation in which i'm sad all the time, am I? i genuinely don't know. That may just be because i joke about depression and suicide constantly so they might just think that i'm not serious with this but being honest, i think those jokes are the truth but i don't know how to tell them. I can barely talk to people normally already so i already know i can't talk about serious things. One time i tried to tell my mom i thought i was bi and she yelled at me and said i was confused. i think i found out i was in 6th grade, then told her in 7th, then we never talked about it again. Maybe she forgot by now, she jokes that if any of her kids we're gay she would kick them out. I think my dad wouldn't mind if i was, that he would still love me after, but i'm scared. i want to be young and date people, a very beautiful girl had a crush on me but i was too quiet and shy so she stopped talking to me because she thought i was boring and quiet. maybe it's for the best, i think i would be too scared to date behind my parents back. ( they're fine with guys 100%, so for now i'll stick with that) I'll wait till i'm the child they're proud of then i'll tell them, maybe if i graduate university i will. That's all they want us to do anyway.

I'm very sorry i made it this long but genuinely haven't told ANYONE before about all this before if you could give me advice i would be grateful, even if no one replies i'm happy i at least released something after all this time.",16Oct2019,6

I’m not talking about smoking weed (I don’t), I’m talking about real, hard, addictive drugs just to get fucked up as a means for something to do and temporarily patch up my depression, anxiety, loneliness and boredom. That’s the average day in the life of me.

I don’t go out on weekends, I don’t hang out with friends because I don’t know enough people where I live (and the people that I do know are never down to chill) and I wish I was. I’m too self-aware and introverted. I absolutely **hate** talking to people, it’s the most uncomfortable feeling in the world. Every conversation just feels awkward as much as I’m trying to keep one going. My life feels like a movie and every action I make will have a consequence so I just don’t do anything.

I’ve always have had self esteem issues. I’ve always been the heaviest in high school, and right now I’m still not at my goal weight (150 aiming for 130). I’m also the older one in the relationship so I feel so so shitty around his friends, considering their younger, prettier, smaller, and just more interesting.

He has gotten so sick of me comparing myself and just shutting down and have meltdowns that he refuses to have me around which is understandable .. I just don’t know what to do with myself anymore. 

I’m afraid of being in that moment and just shutting down. I over analyze everything!

• What’s the girl to guy ratio of friends?
• She’s way smaller than me why is he with me?
• What do I have that’s so special compared to others?
• I was never athletic in life but all of his friends seem to be? Only thing I do and have changed in my life is going to the gym. I’ve never been good at sports...

It’s really ridiculous, and I am so sick of myself. It makes me feel even more worthless once I breakdown. I start to feel like things are just better off and he’d be happier if he was never with me. It’s like no matter how hard I try, I will never be enough in any situation.

He’s having his travel friends over this week for fame night and I am freaking out.. only reason he said he wants me there is because it is at our place and if I have a meltdown I’d be able to retreat to the bedroom.. even this makes me feel shitty but I don’t blame him based on how I’ve acted in the past.. 

What could I do to be friendlier? More confident? Outgoing and not so quiet?...it’s not like I don’t have friends.. this only happens when I am surrounded by his group and I start to feel worthless...

Any advice, videos, articles, etc would help. I just wish I wasn’t so angry in my head. I wish I didn’t compare myself. I wish I wasn’t always in a state of competition. I hate feeling worthless.

He was trying to give me a 130 fine for a non existent law he made up on the spot to harass me after I crossed the street.

If that officer was not doing anything wrong he would not have been running away from me.

He and I are the same age (25) and she is younger than us. She and I also went to the same high school and had a class together my senior year. She’s been in a relationship for years and doesn’t work in his field. A totally mystery. Shortly after we started dating he removed all 4 of them from his friends list. I never brought it up but I’ve always been curious about how he knows her. After a recent series of events I was given access to all of his online accounts. I saw his “list” of people he’s slept with typed in his notes, skimmed it because I’m nosy, and saw that one of them was labeled “Sarah - Cancun.” Y’all I knew in my GUT it was her and I was determined to prove it. Two weeks ago I casually asked if he knew anyone by her name and he said no. So with nothing to go on but a hunch I started investigating. I figured out when he was in Cancun, that she was in Cancun that same week... 8 years ago, one month before she started at my school. They stayed at the same resort, no photos together, and not a single interaction other than her posting happy birthday on his wall 6 months later. “Sarah - Cancun” really was “Sarah from my high school” and I knew it in my bones I swear. After sitting on it for a week I brought it up again, either he was lying or I was about to drop the biggest coincidence in his lap and finally prove that 1.) my ability to find things out knows no bounds and 2.) I live in the biggest small town in America.

So I bring her name up tonight and he was annoyed that I asked again after he already told me he didn’t know her. He knew they were friends on Facebook at one point but he didn’t remember how they met and didn’t recognize her at all (she’s changed a lot). He wanted to know why I was pushing the issue and I just said I had a theory about how they met but I wasn’t 100% sure. After a little bit of pressing he figured out what I was getting after but assured me it wasn’t her. He legitimately did not remember who “Sarah - Cancun” was but he was positive it wasn’t the girl I went to high school with. Mind you, this is the only girl on his list he didn’t actually know or have any sort of relationship with. A totally random one night stand in another country. Anyway I told him I found out she was in Cancun the same week as him 8 years ago. He had no words, at this point he’s starting to think I’m right but made me dig a little more because I didn’t have any photos of her in Cancun and I didn’t save any proof. Needless to say I found all the proof and then some, and his response to all of this was shocking. He legitimately didn’t remember it was her because it was a brief encounter almost a decade ago. He said he wondered who she was but accepted that he would never know and moved on from it. Like any normal person would. I was expecting him to go off on me for being a legitimate psycho, piecing this together from a name as common as Sarah. He said that I was the smartest and most incredible person he’s ever met, he doesn’t know a single person who’s mind works like mine and just figures things out on a gut feeling (he’s seen me do it several times since we met). My heart fricken melted.

Anyway there’s no point to this other than me just needing to tell someone about it.",16Oct2019,6

52,"After many years, during the last few months I had some chances for some kinds of relationship with girls.

But, for some reason, even when it's clear that a girl likes me and is flirting with me, even heavily, I can't do anything.

I do show my interest is some way, but I just can't properly respond to the flirt. There's something in me that stops any attempt to put into reality that I'm having my way with a girl.

I had my first kiss during this summer, and it was thanks to a particularly proactive girl, who just wanted to pass a good night with a guy that happened to be me. In that case, I was just inexperienced, there was no way I would have been ready even for some basic foreplay, we only had very light petting that she initiated, and only after hours of that I *asked* for a kiss.

Notice that I asked for it, I didn't just go and kiss her. We were close, she didn't do it up until then because she thought I didn't want it (otherwise why would I not do it before?). I had to ask, and she led it. But again, being my first time cuddling with a girl, I just explained my behavior to me that way.

Afterwards, I had another girl heavily flirting with me. She was a bit less proactive, so I had to take some initiative. But I couldn't even kiss her. What's more: a month have passed, and I didn't write to her, who in this case lives in my city. It was pretty clear to me and to others that she probably wanted sex that night. Did I not want sex? Maybe, again it would be my first time, so the pressure is quite high.

&amp;#x200B;

For the last month I've been thinking of what is going on in my mind. And that seems to be the case: I'm really passive. Even with friends, I hardly ever propose some activity to do, I hardly ever invite friends to places. It's just my nature. If I see some activity I might like, I won't even save the link to its info. I just can't think of proposing it to my friends.

I did invite friends to go out some Saturday nights, but that's just because I don't want to be alone at home.

But this nature of mine is ruining my chances with girls, as they won't ever take the initiative, and even if they do, I wan't respond as I would.

Is it just that I'm nervous? I'm scared to show how inexperienced I am? What I feel is that I can't convince myself that a girl is interested *in me*, and *me* means ""*what I want*"". For some reason I feel like when these girls flirted with me, they wouldn't have been interested in knowing me, some part of me is convinced that they just wanted my body and I would have been a bad driver for it. Put it shortly I feel the pressure of being inexperienced and that I'm not cut for girls' expectations.

And it's not just an experience gap. I've been dating a girl (18F) for some time, she was pretty shy, probably inexperienced (maybe not as much as I were), but she initiated the dating by writing to me every day for a week. I invited her to have some walks alone, and we didn't even touch. In short, I couldn't flirt. As soon as she stopped being interested in chatting, I stopped inviting her. See, I have no initiative, I don't have it my way.

Of course I'll try to be more open about my desires the next time a girl flirts with me. But will I be able to? Is there something I must confront about myself?

&amp;#x200B;

(about me flirting with girls, problem is that I need to experiment, I'm still a teen inside, so if I were to flirt with any girl I liked, I would be flirting with at least half of the girls I know. That's why I prefer to wait for a girl to show interest)

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: *Lately, some girls flirted with me, probably expecting to have sex. But I'm extremely passive, and I stop as soon as they stop. I feel like this is because I think I'm not cut for their expectations, because I'm inexperienced. But it's probably deeper than that, as I don't feel my own desires and lust, and I'm generally a passive person.*",16Oct2019,2

61,"I’ve been dating a girl for about a month and a half, and we haven’t had sex yet, I suppose we’re both a little old-fashioned. Not to give the wrong impression, I have had sex before, just not with this girlfriend. 

I’ve been extremely busy lately, and I noticed that I hadn’t had a wank in almost two weeks, I decided to see how long I could go, just for fun. 

At the two-week mark, my girlfriend popped round for a visit. I ended up taking her out and we had a lovely time, I think she was quite impressed with me because as soon as we came back to mine she was all over me. One thing led to another and the next thing I know she’s trying to get my clothes off. 

She told me she wanted me, and as I’m but a man, who am I to deny her this? So I obliged, or tried to. Unfortunately, within seconds of her grasping my knob I climaxed with the force of a firehouse all over the inside of my trousers. 

She had to leave as she had work in the morning and it was getting quite late, so we never got a chance to go again before I could “reload.”

64,"Okay so this is a story that has occurred recently. So I was apart of a GTAV Roleplay ( RP ) community for the past 10 months odd. Now this community was more around what we wanted to see and happen. 


Okay so let’s call these people Jim, Cam, David Frank. These are the main people that were either in the discussion, played a part or just said something. 


Obviously not their names that they go by. 



Ok so Jim asked about when we are mainly active and why haven’t we been patrolling much since he joined. So myself and 5 others answer with along the lines of “it’s coming in school time and it’s winter so many people won’t be active as much.” So I replied the same thing but included “If you wanted a community patrol 24/7 maybe and perhaps and I’m not saying you should go and leave this and join another one but a larger community might suit you.” Now this wasn’t intended for Jim to do that. And many community’s allow a person to be in more than one. 


So Cam Stated that I had no right to be saying this and so on. Person Cam then also stated that “Oh okay now he did thanks guys”. And basically called  me out. 


So then I had said “okay well I need to leave and get some rest”. (Because I was tired at the time and need to take a nap because I knew something was going to happen.)


So I left for an hour and it kinda settled down but then David types this long thing about ‘How we say we are a second family and yet it doesn’t feel like it’ and so on. ( Because we tried to make it feel like another family ) 


Oh so then this sparked it up again so then Cam posts an @ everyone saying ‘that is all BS and we shouldn’t be treating everyone like this and for this reason I am leaving.’


Oh and this started a mass exit about 10 people had left before this announcement and when this hit another 15 goes. 


Now from my point of view what I had said to one person would have yer had him considering to leave but what I had said after what Cam and David said that was the main reason why people started to leave. Did what I say contribute?? Maybe.

Dear Sir,

I am contacting you in regards to the ongoing and escalating State-Sponsored Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity (torture unto murder by means of advanced Military Weapons Platforms utilizing directed energy and frequency-based delivery systems) being perpetrated against the civilian populations of the USA and Europe by their respective governments through the intelligence agencies as well as with the direct involvement of Defense/Military and International Defense/Weapons Contractors. The pretense of this being a so-called “shadow operation” with plausible deniability is no longer even remotely viable. The wide spread evidence, victim testimonies and whistle blower exposures make such pathetic attempts of the perpetrators at denial utterly ridiculous. These atrocities and crimes are the most heineous and egregious offenses ever to have been committed against the human race.

It seems to me that the validity and purpose of the UN itself is now on trial. Having been born of the necessity for Justice and future prevention of the Nazi Murders of WWII, there has never been a more pertinent need for what the UN declares itself to represent than right now. Yet (from you) there is only silence. While the atrocities grow every single day, it is only the responsible and truly courageous citizens and whistle blowers whose voices are heard amidst the cacaphony of political rhetoric and outright lies spewed forth from propagandizing banana republics as they cowardly declare their citizens to be “threats to national security” and militarize themselves and every level of government/law enforcement against the populace. Escalating daily, (they pass unconstitutional) new laws and legislation, just as their Nazi predecessors did. (These have the effect of) “legalizing” baseless incarceration, institutionalization, torture, atrocities and crimes against humanity on an unprecedented scale.

Basically, in realizing more and more, that as i improve myself more, im finding how fake and non genuine people can be.

As some background, i was not a popular guy in high school (19 now, graduated in 2018), but i got around quite a bit. I had no regard for how i made sexual partners feel, and had no problem dropping them and moving on to the next cheap thrill.

Now that im out in the real world, with a real job, and real responsibilities, ive calmed from that lifestyle. Now ive formed myself to be a caring, genuine dude, who wants to love and be loved in return. 

But is almost as if women my age do not want this? Not to sound like too much of an incel, or to come off as misogynist, but it seems to me that as soon as i calmed down and started treating people right, i became the one getting played. 

Its very strange to me, that everyone i played back in my ‘fuckboy’ days would complain over not being able to find a good guy, then once i work on myself enough to be the best guy i can, no one wants that anymore.

(it came out so long... read it like a telenovela atlist itll be funny)

im 19 years old, i never had a serious relationship with with someone, iv dated only 2-3 women and had sex only once in my life.

in  the last 2 years or so, i tried to foce myself to look for the love of  my live and i forced myslef to fall in love with a couple of women i  never really loved.

in the last 2 years i searched for LOVE

i  started to work in this place 4 months ago. its a regular workplace  with minimum wage. i even have a friend from school that works with me!  (im from israel and in my country you have to enlist y when you finish  highschool, i chose to keep studying 2 more years to get an engineering  diploma and then go to the army).

so life is fine so far.

apparently  there's  this beautiful girl that started to work on the same date that  i started.  so we met a couple of times at work, actually we have been  working alot together. i really liked her, she was beautiful, smart,  kind, and when she smiled or did a weird face i felt dizzy.

but then one of the workers told me that she had a boyfriend for 1.5 years.

but  lucky me- i didnt had any expectation for a relationship with her,  cause i knew i had a problem falling in love with everyone .

so  we continued to work together, as usual. but after a month i saw that  she had something on her mind the whole shift, and i started to ask  whats bothering her, and i discovered that its alot.i offered to take  her to the beach someday in the afternoon and i would love to talk to  her and hearing her Sharing her feelings.

so  we did it, we went to the beach and set down and talked. im sorry, she  talked, a lot. but it was fine cause i loved it, i loved her voice so  much. but then i listened so her story. and it was rough as hell.

and  we met a couple of more times. and she countinued to talk and talk and  talk.and  i listend.  and i felt in love with her more and more every  single meet.

but her story, that i kept listening to. it started to go deep in me.

let  me share her story so you could get my point:    today shes 19, like  me, she had 2 parents who always abused her as a child. oho yeah and  they were cracheads- doing drugs. when she was 12 her father died from  overdose, and she was thrown into boarding school.

at the same year she was 12 and thrown into boarding school, she was also raped by the pool guy at the boarding school.

RAPED

when  she was 13-14, she had a Socialist and a group of workers who helped  her pass this trauma. and there was a special man who really healped her  out. she said that he was like the father she never had. and listen  here to the funny part. the same guy, yes yes this guy who ""was like a  father"" to her, he raped her. for 3 months. after one YEAR of HELPING  her going through this. he raped her for 4 months. 4 fucking months. at  the age of 14.

she had a boyfriend  at the same time. she met him in this ""school"". and she told him about  everything. he fricked out and called the police and  Immediately the  guy was arrested and again a Socialist  took care of her.

oho  yeah, im sorry, again. this boyfriend? they'v been together for a year  now, and he abused her. yes, yes- ABUSED HER, PHYSICALLY. for a year.

pretty fucked up life hah?

today  she's living with her current boyfriend. he is 26, living in his  perents house, he never studied, he dont even want to study anything.  and he is a pizza delivery guy. the funny part is that she think he is  gay. she gave me alot of reasons why, and im not going to share them  beacuse there are too many ditalis. lets just say that i belive her when  she says that he is gay.

at this  point i know this gir for 2 moths. and we both acknowledged that we had  feelings for eachother. and we kissed for the first time.

as  more as we go further is this story i notice how miserable she is. she  live with her boyfriend beacuse her mom is  Psychopathic and she have no  family to go to. she dont love her boyfriend, and actually. either as  him, he dont show any love for her at all. but she cant breakup with him  beacuse she have no where to go.

3 and half month is this story by here.

every  meeting. we kept falling in love. i loved her so much but there was  nothing i could do. we tried to breakup and stop talking. but we coudnt  do it. and we kept falling in love.

then  she told me that in less then a month from now, she have to Enlisted.  and we thought that maybe through the army she could get fundings to get  an apartment  beacuse she is considered as a lone soldier beacuse she  dont have a family.

we were happy  cause we though that less then a month everything is going to go alright  and we could be toghther and love eachother finally like we want to.

and then she got a message from the army.

she have to go through a course of 3-4 months, and in this 3-4 months shell be at home only 2-3 times a week maybe even less.

that means that she have to wait 4 more months untill she even get an answer for her fundings for an appartment!

4 MORE MONTHS!

so we are at the present now... and my head really hearts. i dont know what to do.

i  really love her. i love her so much, i never knew i could feel like  this. but she casuing me so much pain. it was hard for me to keep it  like this for 3 moths, i was so close to breaking this all up. but i  didnt. now? for 4 more months? and i could bearly see her! if ill get  lucky only once a week! i dont think that i can do it.

i think about braking this up

its  so painfull. i know she loves me, and i really love her. but is it  really worth my soul? i feel like i cant function without her, i thought  that in 2 weeks everything is goind to be okay, but 4 more months?!

i dont know what to do, and i had to share it with someone, even if no one is gonna see it.

There was, however, one girl who I have been friends with since primary school. She moved to another town when we we’re 6 or 7yo. We met up again when we were around 12. We have been each others besties also for quite some time. Her friends knew she liked me, my friends knew I liked her, yet nothing ever happend.
She is the only person I have ever fallen in love with. She had the same feeling as I did and when we were both 17, we were somewhat dating. 
However, when we were about to have our first kiss, she had a panic attack. From that moment onwards everything went downhill.

Today I have never really had a crush again and I barely have any feelings left for this girl. The past few weeks I was really struggling with wether I’m ever going to have that feeling again.

81,"I feel disconnected but also I feel so much emotion. Any thought that enters my brain makes me want to cry. 

Last night I prayed for the first time. The first time in years, willingly and not just because everyone else in church bows their heads. Instead of reminding myself of gratitude and everything that I’m thankful for I prayed for acceptance and change.
 
Accepting myself is hardest part of this change . It’s obvious I over analyze, and I’m the biggest critic of myself. I have “not being good enough” ingrained in me, a bad habit I need to kick to the curb. My criticism of myself spills onto others who call me out on my behaviors. Which is great, call me out on my bullshit. When I lack self-awareness tell me I’m acting like a turd. 

But really? I want to be told “hey, it’s okay that you’re feeling this way. This emotion will pass. I’m here for you.” Affirmation is what makes me feel secure. I feel less than when I’m called out on my bullshit without that affirmation that it’s all going to be okay. 

I suppose I need to tell myself that more often, instead of getting butt-hurt when that expectation is not met. 

I asked God how I could love someone so much, so very much. I asked God how I was unable to love myself just as much.",16Oct2019,4

84,"We dated for 3, almost 4 years, she was honestly my favorite person to be around for a while and we loved each other a lot. I mostly ruined the relationship by being an ass to her, but she wasn’t perfect either. 

We had different goals, different values, and we just weren’t that compatible although I thought it was worth it because of the love we had for each other. 

It’s been 2 months and she’s a completely different person and it’s crazy. She’s dating some guy who posts shit online like “Don’t push me, I would kill for mines”. She grew up with a rich family and works as an engineer. I literally just can’t fathom it. 

Anyway, I just can’t get over how she was everything to me and now I want literally nothing to do with her. Even after the breakup I pretty much begged (sad, I know. Never talk to your ex, learned that lesson) for her to try again and now I just wish I could erase every memory of her. 

I hate that she knows everything about me, hate that I wasted so much time. I learned a lot from the relationship and how to treat someone but I held on for way too long.

Problem is I still think about her. Some days a lot, some days not at all. I just don’t get why or how to stop it. She was such a good gf and person, it’s hard to accept she’s just not the same anymore. I never thought she was like stunningly pretty but now that she’s gone I do. It feels like my idea of her isn’t what she really was but I can’t think of much negatives when we were together. 

Also feel forced to rush into dating now. I’ve seen 6 or 7 girls since the breakup, a few were just hookups but one I really liked but that got messed up because my ex and I tried to work on things. I just feel so codependent and like I need to find someone quick. Like when I only get 2 matches for day on tinder or if I don’t have a date or plans lined up for the weekend, I just get really down. It sucks and I don’t know how to change that feeling. Before my ex, I was perfectly fine with being single. Feel so mentally weak. 


TL;DR I have some issues after bad breakup",16Oct2019,1

91,"Our society demonizes such a final choice, whether it's assisted or self-committed. Any discussion on the topic is invaded by pleads, offers of help and emotional messages. The topic is so controversial that I'm avoiding the S-word: give a look to this subreddit's rules, even. I can understand that this is the safest option, as terminal thoughts could be caused by a temporary disease or fixable issue.

However I think that it should be possible to have a rational or philosophical conversation on the argument. I would like to discuss why our society handles deaths the way it does, what could be the best way out that minimize harm to the survivors, whether one's curiosity is caused by fixable problems or chronic ones.

99,"Hey guys, so clearly by the title I'm failing college. 

So some backstory: First semester (18 M) in community college. Long story short, I felt pressured to go to school even though deep down, I knew I wasn't ready or interested to go right after high school. My parents threatened to kick me out of the house numerous times if I didn't enroll. 

They also made me get a job for the summer since I enrolled for the fall (not complaining, just adding additional details) 

I also have a passion for photography/video work. It's going pretty well, I'm slowly building a lot of high up connections, just got off a tour with some rappers, and getting a mini fan base. Which is good considering I've doing this for less than a year. However, it's still not at a point where I could be self sustaining yet (my dream/ life goal) 

Once school started, I started feeling the pressure of working 20-35 hours a week + full time school + my nearly full time photo work. I felt disconnected from myself. So I told my parents I wanted to let go of my job. They said I shouldn't. But a month and a half into the semester, I couldn't take the pressure anymore and quit my job. As I much rather go to school than work at a shitty fast food joint. 

Because I tried to tackle so much at the beginning of the semester, I missed many assignments and have straight F's across all my classes. I've been doing the work consistently the past 2 weeks but my average barely increases and with time slowly running out, I don't think I will be passing this semester. 

I also don't really feel like I'm gaining anything out of school though. I'm majoring in film production but I honestly feel like I'm wasting my time and could be doing better if I simply worked and focused on continuing down my photography path and see how that works out. 

I'm going to finish this semester and hopefully pass. But I would like some 3rd person input.",16Oct2019,1
100,"So October break just ended, and I failed my math exam that I wrote before the break (Grade 12 IB Math HL). To my defense, even the smart Asian kids in my class said that this test was super hard and even they only got 80s or something, very few ppl got 90s. 

I'm Indian, I've been living in Germany almost my entire life, and my way of studying, my behaviour, my attitude towards anything, etc, is obviously different from that of my parents, who grew up and spent most of their life in India. Now I'm not saying I'm like completely German - I speak my mother tongue fluently and am equally as Indian as I am German. However that changes when it comes to maths and studies in general, as all Indian parents think that because they were A+ students and always got full marks on all of their math exams, their children should be able to the same ""because it's in our DNA"". BULLSHIT

I was 2 marks under the passing grade, and this was definitely my worst exam, but I might be able to get two marks out because my teacher marked something wrong. But even after saying that, their justification is that you'd rather fail and do the retake and get a better grade instead of barely passing, and my dad is threatening me with all sorts of things like taking away my laptop (I need it for essays etc), not letting me hang out with friends, remove the WiFi (I'm the only one who doesn't have a data plan on their phone), not give me dinner unless I do maths the entire evening after getting back from school, etc. He's also being very emotionally and verbally abusive (as always) instead of being supportive and trying to help me: whenever an exam comes up, he immediately distances himself from my studies and says ""I don't care how you do it or what happens, I only care about the grades, and if you're grades are below 70s then you're getting pulled out of the school."" 

It's a private international school, 21500€/year, so I understand that part, but it still doesn't help in any way, even though it's supposed to scare me into studying all it does is scare me more and demotivate me from doing what he wants me to do.

My mother just straight up started restricting everything and also says that she's not angry, just disappointed, and that too in the morning when I got up late and got ready for school too late, and we weren't even talking about maths. To add to that my sister, who saved my ass many times in maths, is also not being supportive and is taking my dad's approach, which hurts me deeply, because I've always relied on her in some way or another to a) be my safe haven when both my parents were mad at me or at each other and b) save my ass when shit went wrong. 

To add fuel to the fire, my dad and sister are not on town for the majority of the week because of their work, but as soon as they get back, the first thing they comment about me is my grades and my ""lack of effort regarding studies"". My sister got a 42 in the IB, which is one of the best grades you can get. And she's 8 years older than me. But even though she's the same generation as I am, she can't even bother to be helpful or supportive when I do fail my exams.

After 1 1/2 years of IB, I can't help but ask myself: am I doing something wrong here, or is my family  just emotionally and verbally abusive? Everytime I get a bad grade (which isn't very often and I have an 87 average for this year so far) I come home trembling and looking for excuses and reasons to justify that grade. It's as if my family judges my worth based on my grades, and it's extremely hurtful. And they know it. 

I can't react or retaliate to their abusiveness because they'll think I'm rebelling and being disrespectful and that'll make them more pissed. But I don't know how to vent it, and I don't know how I'm supposed to feel about this or how to confront them. I know I have to get my grades up, but everything except maths is in the 80s. It's not like my GPA is bad. But apparently maths is the only important subject and failing it is equivalent to being a disgrace and failing everything in their books. I've never been a good student in maths even though I like it, but I can't possibly be at the same level as my parents, it's too late for that unless something miraculous happens and I suddenly turn smarter than everyone else combined.

109,"My own fault. My life is about as bad and pathetic as anyone could get, having been given enough privileges and gifts as anyone would reasonably want and need. I squandered them all, mostly because I didn't try, also because I was ineffective when I did, mostly because I have no experience because I never tried. Ever since I was young I have distinct memories of clear thoughts about suicide as an inevitable eventuality, the only differences being the variables and how far I actually get. 

I've wasted time thinking of redoes in life, but long since come to the conclusion that I'd make the same mistakes for largely the same reasons. Laziness, cowardice, no work ethic. I've never really been happy, at least in the way others with extrensic motivation are. Have you noticed how every goal is easier, and you're inherently more effective when you're working to help someone else, or to support someone who wants you? I never got that lucky, and wouldn't want someone with me at this point, they'd just be slowly disappointed. 

My situation is my own fault, so I don't really have a right to how I feel or complaining about my own laziness and fixable problems on the internet. I usually feel like I'm thinking and living through a fog that I hardly ever care to fight through, but I've always thought very clearly about killing myself, like the fog clears on its own.

113," 

31, haven’t had work in 3 years or had romantic intimacy in 4 years. 

Background: From 23-27 I worked a good job making 90-115k/yr. 

At 27, I was hit by a vehicle and left with an “invisible disability” and chronic pain. Accident put me out of work, lost my career (and friends associated with it) and will likely never return to conventional work. At time of injury I also moved back home into parents’ house-it’s a big home in an expensive city and I get along great with them.

I ‘won’ a lawsuit from the accident and as long as I don’t blow the money (I wont) it ill be drawing a very modest amount for life, much less than I would be making in my career however. Not enough to support a family but enough to support my self. 

For a long time, I resigned myself to singlehood,  but I’m starting to desire some form of romantic involvement/commitment ( from 18-25 I was cohabitating with steady girlfriends). 

Problem is- I don’t have a career and likely never will. 

I’m in a few volunteer groups I attend (pain permitting) and I get interest from women there and when im out doing errands. 

Women assume I have a great job because of my mannerisms, looks and dress. After a few hangouts they ask “I just realized I never actually I asked what you do?”. I usually respond vaguely with “not much, just freelance engineering work here and there.” They accurately read that as “oh so your unemployed”.

I don’t bother to further pursue any of these prospects because I assume that they are looking for a man with a career (which is totally reasonable on their part). I never bother to tell ‘my story’, because it elicits one of two responses; false pity or resentment. 

So a QUESTION I wonder is “How do women for marriage purposes (yes I know they are not all the same) view a man who is good looking, intelligent, and charming, lives at home (by choice) but has no career prospects but presents no financial burden because he has a modest nest egg?”",16Oct2019,3

116,"TL;DR: I am a worthless waste of life and I don’t see why I shouldn’t kill myself.

I don’t want to be alive anymore.
It’s an existence of pain. To know everyday, almost every moment, that you are utterly worthless.
Why shouldn’t I kill myself?


I’ve got nothing to live for.


Family? I don’t care about that. It’s sad but it’s true. It’s not them I want.

Friends? I enjoy my time with them, but they aren’t a reason to keep suffering like this.

My future? What future? Fate has shown me that my future will be bitter and depressed.
I know I’ll fail at getting a decent job. I always fail at these important things. I’m already a failure at everything else.


What’s the point? Why should I continue to live?

I’m a broken, hollow failure of a human. I don’t even deserve to call myself human. I’m just a husk. Worthless scum.

I can’t even feel basic emotions correctly. Only really the basic 3.
How funny.
This was my place in life. Truly, I was put on the earth to suffer.


Why? Why couldn’t I just have been born as someone else?
Everything came together for me to be born as myself. And I failed the moment my lungs took their first breath.


You get one chance at life. One chance to experience it. And I failed. I’m a failure at life.


I’m 17 and I already know how utterly low I am. It’s funny really.
I can’t tell anyone because the moment I mention my age I know they take it less serious. It’s not their fault.
It really does seem like some minor issue. I’m so stupid. I can’t even have actual problems.

I want to kill myself.
Why at 17? It’s so young after all.
Because, why should I keep living when the rest of my life will be like this?
I can’t fix my problem. I can’t solve this depression.
I’m so much of a failure I’m going to kill myself over being unlovable.
What a stupid thing to kill yourself over.

It’s a fitting reason for me I suppose.
That a failure like myself would kill themselves over this.


I think way too much for antidepressants to work. Antidepressants won’t stop me from knowing that I don’t deserve to live.

Therapy wouldn’t work. What are they going to do?
There isn’t any coping technique they can teach me. I’ve tried everything.
Positive affirmations, breathing, trying to distract myself, telling myself that my thoughts are just the depression.
None of it works.

Even if I could manage to trudge through this until I die naturally, I don’t want to.

I do not want to live my life if I’m just going to be alone for it.


I was just unlucky. It’s not anyone else’s fault. Nobody but me is to blame for this.


I’m unlovable and that’s just how it is.
Nothing about me is good.
I’m unattractive. I really fought my myself to stop saying this but it’s true.
I’m ugly. Inside and out.
I know that this isn’t something I can judge about myself because it’s subjective, but I’m not stupid. Although I’m too dumb to be successful I can see that I am ugly, within my heart and outside it.

That’s Hollywood, baby. With as many people as there are in the world, it’s only natural that complete and utter worthless scum like myself come about.


I know that depression often clouds the mind. I know that most people think of themselves negatively. I know that people in my situation get better.
I know that life is worth living.

But I also know who and what I am.
I know that my life has no meaning other than to be unhappy.


Literally every childhood memory of mine is of times where I’m unhappy.
My first memory is of a little 1 year old me, looking up at my father. 

He was angry and had his wooden paddle and was going to use it on me. I remember in that moment not understanding what I had done wrong.


I see my past. I see my present.
And I can make a pretty damn accurate estimation on my future.


What does it feel like to be near someone who makes you happy? 


I’ve had only one crush and I was a fool for it. I let myself think I had a chance. Fortunately, I was able to see the truth before I ruined myself.

I actually thought that fate had finally decided that I had been through enough. 
What a joke. I let my emotions sway my judgment. I embarrassed myself for even having those thoughts.

I let my emotions get the better of me.
I won’t be making that mistake again. Rest assured I will not let myself be so naive ever again.


How wonderful is the feeling of knowing that somebody loves you?


All the true joys of life are unknown to me. I’ll never get to know how wonderful love is. I seek that pure and wonderful connection with someone else.

God I’m pathetic. What a stupid thing to be depressed about. I really am worthless. 
I have to be, when this is my issue.


Everybody I know has someone.
My mother has her boyfriend.
My sister has her boyfriend.
Quite literally all of my friends have someone or have had someone.

As they should, they are good people.


No longer is it just a matter of “I don’t want to live anymore”. 
I WANT to kill myself. I don’t have that fear of death anymore. And I absolutely do not want to live as myself for upwards of 70 years.


You only get once chance at life. One chance to experience it.
And I failed.
I was born to be a failure.


I spend almost every free moment in fantasies played out in my mind.
How pathetic.


It’s funny honestly. I really am a joke.
I know that no woman would be attracted to me, so I never ask. No point of asking just to make a complete fool of myself. 

That, and my absolute lack of confidence would mean that even if I did like someone, and I stupidly thought they liked me back, I wouldn’t ask.

Somebody would have to ask me out. 
But that shit ain’t gonna happen.
That’s not how the world works.
The fact that I have to rely on something so unrealistic is a clear cut example of how stupid and pathetic I am.

What a joke.


I really do hate myself. It’s true. It’s evolved past the point of “Oh, I just don’t like myself”.

I hate myself. I’m angry that I’m like this. Angry only at myself.
But I am bitterly depressed that I’m me as well.


I hope my mother can deal with my death. It’s gotta happen.
I’m just so tired of all of this.
I feel so physically exhausted.
Can she handle it? 
In truth, I don’t care. I feel nothing for anyone. 
I’m a broken, hollow being.

No connections. I truly feel nothing towards people.
I can lie. I can pretend. I’ll put on my little mask and pretend I’m interested in what they’re saying.
But I don’t care.


I’m too exhausted to lie about this anymore. Even in this very writing I’ve styled it so that my thoughts are filtered.

I want to kill myself. I want myself dead. I’ve become so good at detachment that I’ve detached from myself. Hilarious. 

I can’t even fully remove the fake person I live as. His words overtake mine. Even in a post about how much I want to literally kill myself I can’t help but filter my thoughts.

What a joke.


And what should I do?

“It gets better”.
You are correct, it does.
But this isn’t something time can fix.

“You have so much to live for”.
No, I do not.
And the idea that I do is intriguing, but every bit as false as the fantasies in my head.

“You’re so young”.
Correct. But why should I wait?
That’s what it comes down to. If not now then when? Should I wait until I’m 25?

Life does not get better for people like me.
This isn’t a fairytale.


It’s been quite the emotional ride.
But lately I am almost at peace.
I’ve felt so neutral and almost bitter.
Still constantly suffering. It just doesn’t seem to make me as sad.
I’d dip into sadness, here and there. But nothing past mild sadness.

But It didn’t last anyway. It never does. It’s always the most bitter of lows before about 2 or 3 days of normalcy.

My soul is empty.
My life is empty.
I’m a joke.
I’m a man who’s so worthless he’ll never have love, but has become so entangled with it that it’s killing me.


Everyday I am reminded just how pointless I am.
Love is everywhere. You cannot escape it.
It’s must be such a wonderful thing for it to dominate society as it does. There are so few stories in any medium that don’t include love.
As I walk from hall to hall, as I sit in class, people talk and I hear the words they say to each other. I’m reminded of my awful existence by everything.

I can’t live if literally everything related to love kickstarts the depression.
That’s not normal.


I just can’t see any reason why I should continue to live.


I’ll have to overdose. I can’t do it any other way. I’ve heard it’s not painful.

I asked my friend (literally said “do you know if overdosing is painful?”) and he joked. Told me he just bought a bottle of ibuprofen I could have.
It’s funny. I don’t know if he realizes I’m serious. I can’t blame him.

Asked my other friend the same question. Gave me a gentle “Why? No don’t, talk to someone.”

Were it so easy to solve this I already would’ve.


I have no outlets. I can’t express myself in any way. 
I’m poor, so I can’t afford a computer or the license for any software.
I can’t draw at all.
I have no way to express myself.
The only thing I can do is write. It’s all I ever do now. I sit from 4 pm to 12 am on some days and just write.
Not stories, but things like this post.
For 8 hours straight.

I’m just sorry I couldn’t be better. I failed. I failed at life. 
So many wonderful things I’ll never experience.
I can’t live like this. Dying over this is dumb. But it’ll be reality soon enough.

119,"Incase you’re interested in my past post: [first post/previously ](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/di0ioh/i_am_a_woman_from_a_possible_future_and_stuck_in/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

It’s that too long here is a short version: I’m a female from the future, I repeated the same day for one hundred days. Could not remember how I got here. People have said I’ve been here for a weeks time already.

Now for the updated info, the times I’ve learned since two days for the rest of you. Which has been two hundred days for me. 

After every one hundred days I advance one day.

Each day is connect to their previous corresponding day. Day 1 of my 100 day repeat is connect to Day 1 of the next 100 day repeat.

Basically I am living in 100 different timelines at once. I believe if I die in one I obviously will reduce the different timelines 99, 98, 97 etc. I don’t believe this would be a good idea. I believe I suffer from memory lost because I’ve learned that timeline one (from this point on I’ll shorten timelines to TL1, TL2, etc.) I was hit by a car and have been places in the hospital. I believe I’ve suffered from some bad head trauma. Two days ago in TL100 (this timeline) when I posted last I had thought that I was having a bad dream but was not the case. My time in TL1 has been very short the last two times as I’ve woken up for a few minute, only to be put back to sleep by the doctors.

All the notes I’ve written down and thought may have been disappearing, they didn’t. They just stayed in the timeline that I wrote them in.

The timelines are parallel timelines and don’t seem to breach off of one line. I won’t say that they are parallel universes because from what I know then they all would be different in some way. I have not noticed a differences in them. They all seem to be the same unless I do something different or make something different happen. 

I have said was suppose to check out of the motel I was staying at but since I haven’t figured out how to do back to my own time I have increased the stay for all of the TLs that I could. TL1 is kinda SOL right now since I’m stuck in the hospital.

TLDR: Female stuck in parallel time lines has figured out a few things but not how to go home yet.

Ask me anything / suggestions?",16Oct2019,1
120,"I have done something terrible 4 years ago and it’s been hunting me every single day. The pain just couldn’t go and I always felt so guilty. 
I always worried my fiancé would leave me once he knows my reality. 
I decided to tell him and he was actually very supportive and understanding. I feel like a huge weight was taken off my shoulder and I think I’m the luckiest girl alive! I’m just so happy that I’ll spend my life with him. 
People don’t just settle for anyone, real love exists! 
It feels amazing to be accepted and welcomed",16Oct2019,2

122,"This is a work of alternate reality fiction where due to a different chain of events, controversial EU copyright bills ""Article 11"" and ""Article 13"" failed in the parliament.

2018: The EU's controversial copyright filter and link taxes bills first proposed by MEP Axel Voss passed the parliamentary committee and was sent to the EU parliament which vote to reopen the directive for debate in September 2018. However on 12 September 2018, an updated position of the parliament was approved with the final vote.

*.....just as the situation seems bleak for the internet.......*

This time around the cubesat Audaciy 0 was successfully launched via a SSOA rocket from Vandenberg later that year and deployed, whose control GUI was then accessed by a young hacker going by with a Star Wars name and proceeded to manipulate its attitude. The kid then posted the videos of him doing it and dubbed it with Ready Player One trailer music. In his blog post and an ensuing interview with a journalist from the BBC he stated that he's doing it to increase awareness against the copyright bills which threatened the internet as a whole like how Parcival did against IOI in RPO before ending his remarks with a reference to a scene of an Amazon web series depicting an Axis victory.

After the news story broke a greater attention on the European copyright bills were raised and resulted in some protests that were merged with the Yellow Vests. Out of the blue the satellite company has chosen not to prosecute the hacker as he had first informed them to patch it first thereby making it a white haty hack.

As a direct effect Hacker Giraffe and his partner printed out ""Subscribe to Pewdiepie"" and ""Save Your Internet"" messages across printers in the world, further increasing awareness and opposition against those bills. Besides that numerous DDoS actions against pro-copyright websites and flash mob protests in real world were organised by the Anonymous group. For some observers it's essentially a repeat of Operation Chanology that occurred almost 10 years ago.

2019: The aforementioned problematic copyright bills were vetoed by the EU parliament amidst great pressure. Voss then ranted on his Facebook that 'Google' and the 'bots' were behind almost everything else in the opposition against his bill, not excluding that of the Star Wars hacker himself. Much to the hacker's chagrin, he had been described in some circles as the ""Greta of the Internet"", along with Green MEP Julia Reda. The copyright lobby reluctantly accept a compromise solution which entails the creation of a DMCA-like system in Europe.

Later that year an extradition bill was proposed in Hong Kong which resulted in an even larger scale of protests. Inspired from the ""Ready Player One"" and the European copyright protests, the young protesters took to the streets and demanded shelving of the bill. After a violent incident at Yuen Long the demands increased to five. A lot of themes from the 2018 Spielberg film were incorporated into the protests as well.

2020: Donald Trump tried to ride on the RPO bandwagon to incite his support base to vote for him in that years election, however as it turned out he failed by a wide margin. After he lost the presidential election he ranted on Twitter that he can't play the RPO card successfully like others did and proceed to accuse the deep state of meddling it.

2028: Due to being the inspiration of several moment-changing protests Ready Player One was inducted in the Library of Congress' National Film Registry for being one of those ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant films"".",16Oct2019,2
125,"All throughout HS and College, I (23F) never really thought about dating because I was poor and focused on school. Nobody ever really asked me out or ever showed interest, so I kind of just dismissed it as dating just not being for me.

Right now, I'm in a good place in my life. Have a job I like that pays relatively high, no longer dirt poor, gym everyday and go on hikes sometimes, travels semi spontaneously. But still, dating isn't something I can get into because it makes me uncomfortable. A lot of my friends tell me what I'm missing out on so much because dating helps you discover yourself and learn about how you are in relationships and shit. I checked online and reddit, and a lot of people seem to say the same thing and it kind of makes me depressed now.

Honestly, I don't think dating would ever happen to me because a.) I work from home and dont go out as much except for my hobbies, b.) dating apps makes me uncomfortable and it probably wont work for me, c.) up until now, I've never been asked out and nobody seems at all interested in me, so if it hasnt already happened then it means something is wrong with me (I mean dating has happened to all my other friends without them trying so why hasnt it for me?)

I guess what I'm asking is, is it really that bad that I havent dating/been in a relationship up until now? Am I reallyy that emotional and socially stunted because of it? People say dating is supposed to be just fun and meeting new people but it's really hard for me? Like physically hard. Where's the fun in that?

It makes me kind of sad to think about it because I can't take back the time, and it's definitely not gonna be the same now cus I'm older. Plus having no practice just means I'm doomed to fail. It kind of makes me want to cry because I'm incomplete in the personal development part because of something that's out of my control.

tl;dr

Never dated/had a relationship. Am told that I missed out on a lot. Dating doesnt seem possible because of lifestyle. Will most likely end up a spinster.",16Oct2019,2
126,"I am getting packages from Walmart that I did not order but were addressed to me.  They are pre-paid.  The two items so far have been a single bag of those sour peach ring candies and a bottle of a peach colored nail polish with the name 'hottie'.  I did not examine the first box but the second one I checked closely.   One of them had a coded sticker that when scanned reads LQTMS.  I have found only one explanation for those letters, internet acronym for Laughing Quietly To My Self.  The sticker looked official.   No one at Walmart could help me.  I'm thinking if they send another package I will send it back unopened but my mother thinks it might be a mistake.   Can anyone tell me what could be going on here?  Thanks in advance",16Oct2019,1
127,"Here me out (not sure is this the quite the right place) butttt
Everyone will always dream sometimes, but recently, I have had a gap between employment for stress issues and have been able to lie in without setting an Alarm clock. Because of this I noticed a pattern. I have been having intense dreams every single night. my dreams have been so vivid, fun and memorable. It makes sense that this is because I haven’t had to wake up abruptly and can wake up slowly going into REM the last few hours of the morning waking up naturally. These dreams have been really nice and have given me a few ideas to actually use is my life etc. And that’s when it hit me, maybe humans are actually missing out a lot on this part of life? Humans now run on strict routines, always getting up early, rarely getting enough sleep etc. Dreams are away to release different feelings, increase creativity massively and where also a lot of ideas come from. Dreams are basically important AF

Every meaning, every thought, every value we have is important only because we took the initiative to say it is. I know this isnt mind blowing. I know it is a pretty common school thought. But the fact that it clicked to me After years of saying that everything has a point has just set me at ease for the first time in my life.

132,"I am in a relationship and I know that a month or two ago I felt really good about it, we are leading up to our 2 years together. 

However, recently I have felt so down. Nothing is making me feel happy at the moment. 

I think I am being swamped with Uni work and it has killed my mood. 

I know I love my bf but with not feeling happy at the moment, I am feeling little to no joy in anything. I don't know how to talk to him about it. I don't want him to think I am not happy in the relationship, which I know I am, even though I don't feel happy in general just now. 

I am really bad for not talking about things, and I get stressed and worried easily. So I just wanted to write it out and see if it made me feel anything.",16Oct2019,1

134,"So basically I don't have a car. I live roughly half an hour drive from the nearest place I could get any kind of employment. Me and my grandmother are living in a trailer. We don't have to pay rent, but she only gets $1200 a month from SS benefits. She has no credit and I have no income. We need a vehicle. ANY vehicle and I have no clue how to go about getting one. I've already tried to get a loan from the local credit union and to noones surprise, they wont do it without a cosigner. My parents are dead and I really don't want to die alone in the middle of the woods. Our residence is legal. My only internet access is via mobile data. I've been trying to find something on craigslist which we could potentially purchase via a lump sum of ~700 but I'm afraid I'll end up with something that barely works.

135,"I honestly never imagined being 22, I never wanted to rush into adulthood or to grow up like a lot of kids. I really enjoyed my childhood and my teenage years when life was relatively simple. Yes, I lost my father to cancer and my mother got diagnosed 2 months later, but life was still relatively simple compared to the clusterfuck that is the adult world and academia/grad school. That said, to get this far I guess I’m pretty decent at this life thing so it’s an accomplishment for me to bounce back after a huge depressive spell at the beginning of the year following a breakup. 

Feels so weird to be going to the beach on my birthday, I’m from Michigan originally and at USC for grad school so it’s fucking roasting in SoCal right now. Hope y’all have a great rest of your week, love you all.",16Oct2019,15
