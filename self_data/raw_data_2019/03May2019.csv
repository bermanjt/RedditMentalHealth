0,"I am posting here because I have no one else to talk to. 

I had my 16th yesterday and my mom gave me her old cellphone which is decent enough for me to use. She also bought me a $320 electric guitar which is also quite expensive for us. All I can think of is that I don't deserve this. Ever since I was little, she gave me everything that she can afford to and I always disappointed her by doing stupid things. 

My mom is a wise lady. By looking at her eyes you can tell that she is already tired (she started working at the age of 12). I want to say sorry for everything that I did and I want to say that I love her very much. 

Mama if you're reading this I love you.",03May2019,2
1,"Druggy home, manipulative mother, psychological abuse, ghetto part of neighbourhood, getting beat up by other kids, movign to my father hoping for a better life at 12, stepmother ends up hating me beign very controlling, more years of psychological abuse ensue, I move back to my mother, get a job, suddenly become mysteriously ill, lose 15 kg in 6 weeks, no doctor finds a cure for 3 years while I struggle to stay alive, barely able to eat due to stomach pain and nausea, while family threatens to kick me out as they think I am just crazy. 
Turn out I had a rare condition, big 8 hour open abdominal surgery follows to repair and reconstruct arteries in 4 places with the help of an artery removed from the leg.
7 months passed, I am 21 now, 2 of the other patients I know with the same rare condition are not feeling well, one had their condition come back after 1 1/2 years, has to have another surgery... 
I am feeling  okay, iron deficiency since november, but my mother wont pickup the prescription thats laying in the doctors office since a month, so I have trouble breathing and heavy craving, with some other light symptoms.
I feel like thrown into cold water, I dont know where to go or what to do, while everyone pushes me to do something.
I feel so lonely, I have nobody, I never had anybody, I feel uncomfortable with intimacy for the most part, but at the same time, I cannot stop dreaming and imagining people from my fantasies. I crave for some love, genuine love, someone who understands me, I don't need it, I know I can go this path alone, but I yearn for it.
Before my illness, I was slender, even a bit muscular, I had a flat chest and nice skin, I was happy with myself, inside and outside, I had found peace.
But now, I am the same weight as beofre my illness, but I look fat, my doctors keep trying to tell me to do plastic surgery as they find the scars ugly, but I want to keep them, but my stomach itself is now shaped weirdly, it has a large bump at the bellybutton, and my bellybutton is like pulled to the side...  the scar on my thigh is very big, as the skin strecthes a lot there... but it also looks strange, all bumpy, as if you see the artery was taken out there.... one of my boobs somehow had a growth spurt after surgery, and is now even larger than the other than before...I want my flat chest back
I feel so uncomfortable, so incredibly lonely and... ungood, I want to do so much, but I cannot do any of them, I missed so much in my life, I wasted so much time being ill... I feel so lost

I just want to lay into somewhere warm and close my eyes, and not have to worry or be alert, I just want to sleep, I just want to have peace and enjoy life.
After the last 21 years, I am losing hope it is even possible for me",03May2019,2

I wish I could tell people the things about me, but I just can't. 

Lots of abuse has left me lots of problems but nowhere to leave them.  I dont remember much of my life age 13 and below (I'm 17) because of multiple fucked up shit and because its like I locked that me away and started as a new person. 

Super hard to explain. 

I guess you're gonna get a sneak peak of me? Things I've never told people.  It's like kinda fucked but it's me, I think . 

Like my father doesn't believe in depression/therapy so while I desperately need it, I have no access to it. I've been diagnosed with depression (I got in contact with one briefly through my school counselor) and had multiple suicide attempts but I can't tell anyone. 
I was molested at a young age, not that badly , but it's still ..yeah... I was in another country and i couldn't get away from the guy. I told my dad and the guys wife. Nothing happened, I still had to be around him which gave me a fuck ton of shit in my brain. 

I can't remember much bc I've repressed so much of life. Sometimes I walk around and I think about myself and I feel like I should know who I am. But I just feel like I'm in a stranger's body and not where I'm supposed to be.

5,"I know this is a generalization but I'm so fed up honestly. I'm 22 and I don't have a job, like many of my friends, who don't have jobs or who have low paying jobs after university and all their money goes back into paying off student loans.

We're miserable. And quite honestly it's humiliating sometimes to STILL live at home and be treated like you're a kid when you're an adult (yeah I know their house their rules but that just adds to my point. Why would we voluntarily stay in this situation?) I just don't get why the general consensus is that younger people are lazy and don't wanna work and want to stay with their parents forever.

I don't like the fact that I have to be asking my parents for money still and I wouldn't if I didn't have to. Once again, its humiliating.

And it frustrates me when they make it seem like we aren't trying. Like we don't apply for jobs. I feel like they still haven't grasped the concept of job applications being submitted primarily online. They want us to get up and hand deliver applications when nobody does that anymore and your resume will be thrown out.

Like we don't go to interviews and get turned down. Or like we don't go to minimum wage jobs we hate and get talked down to by older people who just have it in the back of their minds that we're lazy and entitled. 

Idk.... Just why do y'all think we LIKE living this way???",03May2019,9

I immediately got upset about if and I went to my team leader and assistant manager and refused to take their food to them I wanted them kicked out but my team leader wouldn't coz he said I can't be sure they were making fun of me. later on I had to check the toilets and I walked upstairs to girls toilets and the door opens and it was them girls I looked up and the girl that laughed earlier smiled at me, and I overheard em saying whys a boy going in girls toilets and walked past me as normal.

Even with my life not being that great Reddit has been a wonderful place to browse and ask questions. It has given me a place where I can connect with communities that share common interests or problems of mine. It has given guidance on how I can improve my life and it has given me hope so that I know that depression doesn't have to last a lifetime. My goal right now it to cut out all of the horrible frozen pizza that has made up basis of my diet for about a decade. I'm also a picky eater but the people on Reddit have told me about healthy food that I can actually enjoy. Reddit of course is made of people coming together, sharing and communicating.

She then proceeded to completely open up about what was going on in her life. And it was SO SIMILAR to the stuff I’m also going through. It was like we were brought together in that moment.

Like, if a comment has hundreds of downvotes, there isn’t much I can do. But if I see a comment with a big “0” I just get this urge to upvote it so at least they don’t feel shitty.

I feel like we neglect how much of an emotional impact our “fake internet points” actually have on some users on the site, and therefore I will assume it hurts everybody, and not downvote anything.

Am I wrong to upvote somebody who is wrong just so I can make them feel right? Because some people ask me when viewing me using Reddit over my shoulder, “Wtf why’d you upvote that?” And then I constantly have to give this same explanation.

24,"So to start, I'm (M20) bestfriends with this girl (F19) that I met in Facebook around 5 years ago.
I need to tell some backstory so please, bear with me ahah. 

Something to have in mind it's that it's not hard at all for me to have a friendship with a girl, I quickly know if I would like to be his friend or get to know her better to maybe be more than that etc. etc. you get the idea.
One time we were having a conversation and I can't remember well what I was talking about with ther but she said that she used to have feelings for me and wanted to confess how she felt towards me. This was only like 2 months after meeting me. I said that I was truly blessed to have a friend like her and that I didn't wanted our friendship to end so I wanted to keep being just friends and she said that she understood.

Fast forward to the present, around a week ago, I was just talking to her like normal stuff [btw we don't live anymore in the same province as I moved away but we still text]. She was telling me about a boy she kinda liked but this guy was a total jerk. I just gave her some advice that she shouldn't feel sad or anything because the guy wasn't worth it and was just wasting her time etc etc... Until today she said something that I don't know how to feel about it. She said: "" With you, why do I even need to have a boyfriend, you're like 1/4 of my life"" ( The other 3/4 are her parents and her sister) 

It's like... she valuates our friendship A LOT she's kind of jealous when I tell her that i've been hanging with other female friends as she says that she's MY BESTFRIEND and states that clearly. 
She's doesn't control me or whatever, she doesn't get mad even if i hang out with other females, but to the point that she says like I dont need to have a boyfriend... because I have you? I really don't know how to feel about that tbh.

My question is: Is she just someone who valuates friendship a lot? Or maybe she still have feelings for me? I don't know.

30,"Today I watched [Long Shot (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2139881/) at a cinema. It's a movie about a romance between the main character and a candidate for the US presidency. That's in the trailer, and I don't intend to offer spoilers.

I knew it wasn't a genre of movie I tend to like, and knew some parts would be painful, but it was way more painful than expected. My mother wanted to see a movie, this was convenient, and I was curious about how I would experience it. Now I'm left wondering why it was so painful.

I don't think the movie itself is supposed to be painful, and I'm pretty sure it was okay and wasn't painful due to being terrible. Nevertheless, maybe 90% of the movie was painful for me.

I saw that there are two main patterns which made it painful for me: romance and awkward stuff. But I don't have very much insight about emotions. Like, it mostly wasn't thoughts or emotions I can identify, just pain.

I know part of why romance was painful was because of lack of that in my life. But, it doesn't feel like that tells the whole story, and it seems like a lot of the pain was due to other reasons.

I know awkwardness can be painful due to empathizing or maybe I should say imaging what it would be like to experience something similar. But again I wonder if that tells the whole story.

I've had experiences where the same awkward parts which are typically painful can instead bring about laughter and a sense of release which feels really good. It seems when I'm in a bad mental state my experience of such things tends more toward pain, and in a good state my experience tends more towards laughter. But I need to be in a very exceptionally good state for that experience to tend towards laughter.

I did see that when others laughed during the movie, on a few occasions that caused me to laugh. But such experiences were quite rare. Though it doesn't' seem like others laughed much during the movie, which makes me wonder if it's actually good.

So, I have some insight, but I feel like a big chunk of what's behind my reactions is frustratingly opaque. While frustrated by this during the movie, I thought taking drugs and watching the movie on my own might help me. Maybe cannabis could help with insight, or DXM could dull emotions enough to make them easier to handle and understand, or maybe I could even try watching it while tripping on morning glory seeds. But I'm not convinced any of this would provide sufficient insight or be beneficial overall.

I know maybe I could just say, it's just a stupid movie, who cares, I'll just learn to not watch movies like that overall. But I have a nagging suspicion that the way I found the movie painful is related to what significantly holds me back in real life. That's why I'd like more insight.",03May2019,1

33,"                                                       Introduction

Sometime around March 2000 I was conceived, on the island of Madagascar, off the coast of East Africa. Family rumor has it that there was a meteor shower that night. I cannot confirm nor deny the truth in that particular statement but I reckon bullshit.

 My mother married my father when she was 16, but their marriage was considered to be common law and they had been together for 7 years when I came into the world. 

My parents, were an unusual couple. My father, was 26 when he met my mother at a dance party, and she was young, very out-of-control but ultimately impressionable and vulnerable. She craved the father figure she never had, and as someone who felt lost, my father was someone for her to follow.

Together, they were pretty much both wild hippies. Smoking pot, living in Jamaica before I was born, travelling around the world, and heading to Africa for some strange , rastafarian spiritual journey. 

One day when my mother was pregnant with me, her and my father were driving through Ballito in their little brown Jeep, one of them tuned the radio, and it bellowed

“Got to have Kaya Now,
 Got to have Kaya now, 
Got to have Kaya now, 
 For the rain is falling, 
I feel so high, I even touch the sky, Above the falling rain,
 I feel so good, in my neighborhood, so here I come again”

I’m not exactly sure what was said in the conversation, but somehow, it came under a mutual agreement to name me after the song “Kaya” by Bob Marley. 

The “Kaya” he was alluding to was pot. My parents were fully aware of this and this made it all the better in their stoner-Hippie Rastafarian eyes. 

On December 7th, 2000, I was born to David and Sarah in Durban, South Africa. I was a mixed race child, half west indian, half mystery 7 years after Apartheid ended. 

 As a toddler, my hair grew in blond loose curls and I was the spitting image of my mother. My father, was dismayed, because he had wished for me to be darker in skin tone and more “Hebrew” in appearance, aka Black but that’s a discussion for another time. 

We moved from South Africa to Mauritius, to Seychelles, then to Cayman with my father’s family, but then Hurricane Ivan wiped out the infrastructure and flooded the house. After that we went to Florida to stay in a trailer with my grandmother, and then moved to Bathsheba, Barbados, renting the top level of a beachfront house that my mom also helped to manage. My parents surfed, would tell me strange retellings of the Bible and pretty much cursed the outside world. We were pescatarians and I did not taste eggs, red meat, or poultry until after my mother divorced my father.

I remember once when I was 4, we were riding in a jeep with friends in a jungle like setting, and my father was smoking pot as usual. He handed the blunt to me to puff on, and I handed it to his friend. The smoke made me cough and congested my chest but I did what was shown to me. 

My parent’s marriage was very troubled at that point, and I would often hear them arguing. My mother would lock me in my room while they screamed and bickered at each other. My father was working illegally as an underwater construction worker at the time, and my mom, knowing his permit was expired, got him deported from the island, divorcing him. 

We went to the airport to say my goodbyes, he told me that he loved me. That was the last time I saw him in person, and for 13 years I would have no contact or correspondence with him.

Me and and my mom moved to Florida to live with my grandmother sometime in 2005, who was living on this couple Anita and Mitch’s ranch. 

When we came there, I had dreadlocks, because of my father’s religion.  One evening my mom would prop me up on the toilet  lid and take out a pair of glistening scissors. My tiny feet dangled off of the edge as my mom, one by one, snipped my locks, revealing spiral curl new growth which she’d place a little pink bow in. 

She cut my hair to cut my ropes to the past.The past of Barbados, Cayman, and most importantly, my father. 

My mom left with her boytoy to go on a vacation in Hawaii. She had gone there years before when she was married to my father, but this time, was different. In the time my mom was gone, I got to experience America. I would imitate the movements of those inflatable tube men outside of used car dealerships, tasted artery clogging abominations such as funnel cake and cheeseburgers, and went to places ranging from the State Fair to the Build-A-Bear workshop.

I watched movies with magic with my nana, something I wasn’t allowed to do when my father was around due to his paranoia surrounding witchcraft. 


Chapter One 

When my mom came back from Hawaii, we ended up moving to Kauai. I was enrolled in Hanalei School at the age of 6. I had a bajan accent and was a good amount taller than all of my classmates. In a sea of blond, blue eyed children, I was tanned and curly haired. I obviously stood out. The children themselves were too young to say off colored remarks regarding my racial background, but at times, adults were the ones to do so. 

My second grade teacher compared my curly hair to a rat’s nest,astutely claimed my accent was a speech impediment and that I also was mentally disabled, so I was sent to speech therapy to rid me of this affliction as well as put in the “slower” kid’s math class,which was very easy for me. Later in my elementary school years, I would become quite the loner, and everyday, I went to the end of the school courtyard, propped myself against a lamppost, and drew. I had one friend that would come here and there, and we were closest during the last two years before I left the school in 5th grade. 

In 5th grade I became a bit….popular, and started to mix with more friends. I enjoyed being at school, because my home life, was falling apart. We had moved from a large suburban home in an upper middle class neighborhood to a small condo in a lower middle class neighborhood in second grade, and my mom always had some drinking problems, but it seemed to be getting worse around the time I was 10. 

When she first moved to Kauai she was very wild, much to the dismay of my grandmother. She’d bring random men to the house and come home drunk and high on both uppers and downers. She’d also practice witchcraft and try to rid the house of evil spirits. 

After the first half year she calmed down, and started working at a hippie souvenir store called Divine Planet, the type of the store that sells tumeric dyed hemp wovens, wooden carved jolly fat mermaids, wind chimes, and jewelry. She’d make jewelry for the store as well as me and my nana. 

She quit her job and started  mooching off of my grandmother’s trust fund when I was in third grade. That was when she started losing her shit. 

In 5th grade she became highly suspicious of me, and started becoming….purely….off. I didn’t wish to speak to her as often yet she became more and more clingy. She accused the bus driver of strange things such as giving the kids drugs and got into an odd involvement with the school that the bus driver was giving children drugs. 

Chapter Two

One day after school, I had an exceptionally heavy backpack due to having to carry my history textbook and two binders in it. I was sucking on my ruby red, cherry flavored cup of hard ice, which melted into a sticky syrup in 85 degree weather. I was walking home, and went upstairs to the loft, which I shared with my mom. Curious on how much my backpack weighed, I placed it on the bathroom scale. I also discarded my hard ice cup due to its emptiness. 

“Kaya, we need to speak” My mother said in a concerned tone. 

“Yes?” 

“What, was in that backpack Kaya?”

“Um books, it was heavy” 

“Kaya, we need to speak, what have you been hiding?” 

“Umm nothing mom” 

“Kaya, you haven’t been yourself lately, what has been going on?” 

And that was the end….of the beginning and the start of my absolute hell by the hands of my mom. As we spoke, she started throwing crazy accusations at my schoolmates that I was being sexually assaulted at school, by my classmates and that I was doing hardcore drugs such as ice in school. 

She acted out sexual positions using my Barbie dolls and asked me graphic questions about “my sexual assault”. I told her she was wrong and that I had not been assaulted, been offered or had been using drugs but she insisted. She really believed what she was saying. She blamed specific children, children whom I knew she did not like the parents of. 

 She whipped me with a leather belt and boxed my ears for “my atrocious and disgusting acts”, shamed me for being a filthy whore, and relegated me to my corner of the room, in which she threw a Bible at me and told me to repent. She refused to feed me unless I propagated her lie to the school authorities. 

Lucky me I got my period at the same time too, which my mom blamed on “the rape”. She performed “exams” to examine the “rape” often, aka pulling down my panties and touching me. She took me to the doctor to get tested for drugs, and still insisted I was on drugs despite the tests showing no traces of drug use. 

At first I tried denying the whole thing and explaining that I didn’t know what the hell my mother was on, but strangely enough, they took her side and forced me to “tell what really had happened”. My grandmother, also sided with my mom. It’s important to note my mother started experimenting with drugs and having sex at this particular age. 

Confusing the school with a bizarre and incongruent story, she pulled me out and placed me into a small Christian school, in which very wealthy, conservative Christian parents sent their children to. I hated this environment but my mom felt it was needed to cleanse my soul of the disgusting sins I had committed. 

She told the school of my “sexual assault” and “drug use.” And the boy who had supposedly been a one of the suspects went to that school after the “incident”, which infuriated my mother. 

By the near end of the year, the same story played out at this school, but with students from the new school. 

My mom, claimed I was assaulted by older boys, and that I was too drugged to realize it. She threatened to kick me out of the house at 12 if I “didn’t tell my story” so I went along with it, albeit very hesitantly, feeling horrible, and shaking in the principals office. If I fudged a detail my mom would squeeze my hand. She held my hand the whole time. My grandmother was there as well, and refused to believe me when I tried to tell her the truth of the matter beforehand. 

The principal said I wasn’t welcome anymore and that lying was just as bad as rape, so I never set foot on that campus again. 


Chapter Three 

My mom started homeschooling me afterwards, and told the online school I had been brutally assaulted, bullied, gang raped and had been abusing drugs. They sympathized with her “plight” and I wanted to die. She kept insisting I was thriving and was the happiest I ever was. She would tell people about how she had “saved” me from my horrific drug abuse and sexual promiscuity.

My mom, cut me off from any semblance of a social life over a year before that. I wasn’t allowed anywhere except if my mom was going somewhere. We were as if we were attached at the hip, I was her doll. She dressed me in tight maxi dresses like the ones that she wore, heels and full makeup. I was not her daughter, but an extension of herself.

 She even attempted to dye my hair peroxide blond like hers, but ended up turning it to a garish shade of brassy orange that was quite unflattering to my skin tone. 

My grandmother started working at a grocer when I was in 6th grade and this greatly dismayed my mother for a reason I don’t know. Everything would offend my mother. My mom would accuse me of poisoning the dog, inviting overnight guests, talking to my estranged father and other strange, improbable accusations. 

My mom started smoking some sort of laced maurijuana when I was 12 or 13 and offered it to me on several occasions. The smell made my head spin, and felt nauseous and sick. It made my cough and my chest get tight. 

My grandmother called the cops and I was taken away from my mother. I stayed with my grandmother in someone we knew’  house that they let us stay in due to it being empty at the time. I, never had been away from my mother, so I attempted to run away to her. 

I got caught and I was sent back to my grandmother. My mother persuaded my grandmother to come back to her and we did. The case kind of just fizzled out. 

When I was around 13, we started having financial issues and the trust fund was put on hold due to a bank transfer. My grandmother started working and living in another family’s house as a housekeeper. 

My mom, refused to work because she believed there was a worldwide conspiracy against her to keep her away from her millions of dollars. She attempted to brainwash me into believing this was true, but I always felt it was off. 

After 7th grade, we couldn’t afford the private online school due to the bank transfer, so I was out of school for around 9 months. My mom also started becoming obsessed with my teeth and wouldn’t allow me to start school until I got braces. She also shunned normal schools and wouldn’t ever allow me to go to a normal school. 

My life, even though some have had it worse, was hard for me at the time, and I took refuge in writing and drawing. I made imaginary friends because I had none. I’d share these things with my grandmother secretly, because despite her living in the same house, I wasn’t allowed to speak with her. 

My mom had a freak out where she yelled profanities at me, beheaded all of my dolls, spat at me and threatened violence. I hid myself in the bathroom. Cops were called by a neighbor, who let me come and hide in his house with my dog and my nana, but my mom bailed that night. The whole thing was swept under the rug. 

Our financial situation worsened. 

That thanksgiving, we ate stale cheese crackers and canned cheese from an expired gift basket. We were running out of canned food in the cupboard, and my mom refused to accept food from food banks. 

Our neighbors offered us fresh food around December, but my mother refused to accept it after a while. 

For Christmas we drank hot cocoa mix with water and had pancakes made with water for breakfast, which was the food for the day. We eventually ran out and she accepted small amounts of grocery items from the neighbors, but then stopped accepting it again.  

The power was shut off, and we were being evicted. Out of desperation, my mom went on food stamps, applied for welfare and found a job at sales, in which she was fired shortly after due to her incompatible personality. 

When the bank transfer was finished, it was around January. My grandmother came back. I got the braces my mother always desperately wanted for me and we moved to a small cabin in the woods, even more isolating than my previous situation. 

I started 8th grade in February or March and was in a rush to complete my 8th grade year. I looked up all the answers to tests, and did everything in my ability to skirt through. 

In this time my mom became excessively obsessed with straightening my long, very curly hair and claimed I was listening to other people’s opinions on my life when I told her I didn’t wish for this. The singing heat from the iron would burn the tops of the moles on my scalp and my hair would be burnt and fried. 

My hair became extremely dry and brittle, something my mom blamed on me trying to harm myself by not conditioning it. She also insisted I was giving myself acne on purpose. 

She also forced me to get acrylic nails. Something I absolutely hated but she loved. 

Around the time I was 13, my mom became extremely obsessed with my physical appearance in general, but also, my weight. 

When I was a toddler I was a bit chubby, but I hit a growth spurt at the age of 5. After that, I was always fairly slim and lank. 

My mother was always fairly athletic and was never, ever, remotely, even close to being overweight. 

She was anorexic throughout her teenage years and lived off of coffee, alcohol, energy drinks, cocaine and stimulants as well as took psychedelics. 

My mom was going to be a model in New York before she met my father. Physical appearance and weight was extremely important to her. 

When I was 13, she started not allowing me to eat normally and forced me to intensively exercise for long durations. She didn’t want me to gain weight as I grew taller. 

I grew from 5’6 to 5’7” and fluctuated in between 115 and 125 pounds until I was around 16 and a half. My mom would praise me when I was the lightest, and warn me about being chubby and undesirable if I tipped 120. And anything over 130, was positively, absolutely, no doubt fat. 

 I thought I was fat and would refuse to show skin unless i was under 120. When my weight hit “normal” on the BMI scale my mom would encourage me to diet until I was “underweight” on
 the BMI scale. 

When I was 16 the doctor expressed concern over my weight, told me it was unhealthy and that I should probably gain some for health reasons. My mother told me I should take it as a compliment. 

She also placed me on birth control at the time, which caused me to bleed everyday and worsened my acne. She would put concoctions on my face that would make my skin raw, and then blame my flare ups on a lack of personal hygiene. 

When I was 14, my mom threatened suicide unless she was able to get the plastic surgery she wanted. 

 Her request was granted, thus we went to Honolulu, and stayed at The One, an extremely expensive apartment complex built right on top of the Ala Moana Shopping center.

 My mom booked a hair salon appointment she said was a trim, and I ended up getting my hair permanently straightened pretty much against my will or previous notice. 

Meanwhile, she underwent extensive cosmetic surgery on her body. A tummy tuck, breast implants, liposuction, butt lift and more. She claimed it was medically necessary but I knew better. My grandmother thought it would help “her heal” from the abuse of my father. I call bullshit. We stayed on Oahu for a month and went back to Kauai. 

Chapter 4 

We moved houses again when I was 15, and then moved to the island of Oahu when I was almost 16, to a three bedroom city apartment on the 38th floor. Here, I would be mostly a shut in. I wasn’t allowed a social life or time on my own. I was an extreme case of helicopter parenting. Most nights my mom would become drunk and nonsensical. I didn’t like speaking with her and she’d suddenly become hostile or erratic. 

I began going on Omegle at night, secretly, to kill my utter boredom and loneliness. 

I was rarely skipped, namely due to online female privilege. I got attention from guys, which as someone who was pretty insecure, I sought validation in. 

We’d usually exchange instagrams and talk for a few days. There I was exposed to photography of the male appendage, which I’d block promptly. 

But there was one young man on Omegle whom would impact me years on. 

He was a hint unfortunate looking and deathly thin, with deep smile lines, a bulbous nose and dark eyes. He had a look that I hadn’t seen in American white men. I guessed he was Russian, and I was right. He asked me if I knew Russian and I said I could spell “CTAC” or “Stas”. 

He said that was his name. We exchanged instagrams and became friends. We shared the common fact that we were both lonely. Very lonely, to be specific. We both were in ruts. He began to fall for me. And I didn’t know how I felt about him honestly and thought I could be experiencing love. But I liked the thought of him and not actually him, because I ignored his red flags. 

By the end of the year he wanted me to live with him, to come to America and escape both of our lives. We never dated but engaged in an odd dating role play. I never loved him or wanted to but I loved fantasizing about having a boyfriend. We were close friends. 

When I was 16, I was taken into foster care after talking to my online school counselor about my home situation, which was becoming progressively worse. My mother was becoming violent and erratic, and I lacked any freedom to be, or a real social life outside of my friend Stas. 

I was sent to a group home and I was miserable. I hadn’t been around people my age in a long while. There was one girl coming off of drugs, who was trying to get on the right track. The others were a bit rebellious. Never having been away from my mother, I broke into the safe for my cell phone and ran with two girls after one week. They stole my money and we didn’t have food to eat. 

I stole sandwiches from supermarkets, and tampons and clean underwear from Walmart. I also stole art supplies, in which I wanted to draw portraits on the Waikiki strip at night for a few bucks a pop but didn’t get to doing that. I had more freedom than I had ever had. I relied on the kindness of strangers for a bed, was nearly raped by a man who gave me a ride and could had been killed multiple times. I turned 17 on the streets of Salt Lake City, Oahu. 

I met a variety of people whilst living in the streets. Crazy people, users, drug dealers, and some genuinely good people. I will remember one older gentleman whom let me sleep at his place and made dinner and breakfast for me, as well as let me take some food items with me, in which I couldn’t carry the bulk of it and gave mostly to homeless people on the beach in Waikiki. 

Meanwhile, my mother and grandmother were vacationing in New York. Initially I didn’t come back, but hot showers and warm meals lured me back to my mother like bait to a fish. I was not allowed to go outside for a while, and we went to stay in a beach house mansion on the north shore for about two months, in which my mother put me through hell in. 

In that period, I realized Stas was not a good friend. He was emotionally manipulative and becoming creepily attached. I ended up dropping him, but he wouldn’t be dropped. He would create alternate accounts to contact me. We’d talk off and on until less than a year later I stopped responding completely. 

Chapter 5

We went back to the city apartment that year in March, and much to my expectation, the trust fund was out. April 2018, we went to live in a Motel for a little bit. We packed what we could carry and brought our pet chihuahua Roosevelt with us. Me, my grandma, and my mom, in a tiny dingy motel room, for approximately 2 weeks, watching TV. My mom and my grandmother had an extremely strained relationship and it seemed to settle down during those two weeks. 

We then headed to a hostel on the north shore called Shark’s Cove. 

On April 29th, we started living in the car. My mom applied for food stamps so we had food sometimes, but spent it all too quickly so by the end of the month we’d barely have enough to get by. We’d bathe in public beach bathrooms or on campgrounds. We’d wash our clothes at the laundromat or in public sinks. I was still doing online school at the time, in which I’d study in Internet cafes. 

In a stress and alcohol induced rage, after two weeks my mom kicked my grandmother out of the car. My grandmother began living in the public bathroom and started working full time at a grocer, indeed the same grocer chain she had worked at before. 

There was one particular old man whom grossed me out and would constantly hit on me whilst I studied. Everyone else was fine though. The Internet cafes had a handful of regulars, some of which were also homeless. 

My mom got a job waitressing at a restaurant across from the Internet cafe to support us, but was shortly fired after she got the job. She had been applying to jobs for a while but had no luck. 

She’d spend money on alcohol quite often and would waste it on drugs. I graduated 11th grade with mostly Cs and Ds, but at least I passed. My mom had no intention on me continuing my schooling, so I was out at the time. 

I had no whereabouts of my own. I was completely dependent on where my mom drove the car. So I’d get out and go exploring around small woods and forests. In this time, I also drew a lot in pencil and went swimming in the ocean. The outdoors was my home, the car was my shelter. 

Meanwhile, my mom dodged CPS and had to hide from my case, which was still open. We became quite destitute and my mom, already having issues with finding employment, became more and more desperate. 

We had nothing to eat, and my mom decided to audition at a seedy strip joint in the ghetto to put food in our mouths. My mother didn’t have money, but she did have beauty, and was slim and agile. 

Immediately, she was hired. We could finally eat food. We splurged on quarter pounders and sushi those first few days. 

But stripping, would prove to be an ascension into the worse. My mom, would drink heavily every night, and I was trusted with watching the car and my dog. When she worked, I was alone at night in the car. 

There was a local mall in which I’d use the bathroom in before I went to sleep. Occasionally I’d pick up Chinese steamed buns (Dim Sum) because they were cheap and filling. The manager was a bit shady and started keeping an eye on me. Middle aged, short Hispanic guy with gang tattoos. 

He’d ask me to come to his apartment (that was in the mall) and would tell me things of the area, who to avoid and what not. He’d give me gifts.

I went to his apartment once. He wanted to have sex and was saying how great ice was and I told him no. I noticed a bag of ice on the table and I made an excuse to leave. 

I noticed every night there’d seemingly be a different young girl coming to his apartment all seemingly drugged out. I suspect he was a pimp. 

I carried a knife wherever I went and slept with one eye open. 


Chapter 6 

Eventually, living like this took its toll emotionally. Having a phone, I got into contact with my guardian ad litem and I was removed sometime in September of last year. I was placed into the same group home, but this time, I stayed. In one week I was found a foster placement. 

It was in a centrally located suburb I had never seen before. I was greeted by a short Filipino lady who seemed to be a bit artificial in demeanor. She was quick to badmouth the girl who had formerly stayed in my room, for being dark skinned and overweight. 

I was expecting to get a GED, but they said it was too expensive. I agreed to go finish my senior year of high school. I thought, “Well, fuck it, might be like the movie mean girls”. 

Beforehand, I cut my long, crazy, sun bleached, salt water damaged, relaxed, frizzy wild hair into a neat little Afro. Which grew into what it currently is like crazy. 

With my big black back pack and brand new clothes, I started attending Pearl City High School on October 15tg. Alarmed by cliques, I usually sat in the classroom at the beginning. I was always friendly and was overwhelmed by being surrounded by so many teenagers. It was an utterly surreal experience. My marks were good, and I was driven.

 But, I simply couldn’t relate to most people my age. My life was so different from theirs. I hung out with the “nerds” in the beginning and befriended this guy Ryan. He was really outgoing. Physically he was a stocky, tall Asian boy. Not bad looking but his personality rubbed me the wrong way at times. 

But before he met me, I noticed one young man. He’d usually be by himself, drawing. He was tall, rather large, pale as a ghost, and wore glasses. He always looked angry and was kind of intimidating looking. He was a dead ringer for a specific character of mine named August. 

To be honest I found him really fucking cute and wanted to talk to him, so one day, during lunch, my friend Ryan is making preparations for an event during culinary. 

I initially am with him in the classroom, but decide to venture downstairs where the boy who usually draws sat. I was rushing with emotions and had my stomach in a knot but went down anyways. 

“Hi, can I sit here?” I asked. I didn’t realize from afar but in person he had the most gorgeous light blue eyes that lit up his face. He was actually quite a nice looking boy.

“Um, yea, sure” 

“What’s your name? My names’ Kaya” 

“JJ…Ake” 

I asked him his age and where he was from. He said he was a local, which was slightly disconcerting to me due to his very fair complexion and general style of dress. 

I asked him about his hobbies, and he revealed he was into art and drawing. My eyes lit up. He showed me his sketchbook and it was amazing. Beautiful, realistic, detailed drawings. I hadn’t seen someone my age so into drawing in my life before. His skill was way beyond what I expected. 

We talked about things and what not and I liked him even more afterwards. 

The bell rang and I had to go. He shook my hand beforehand and said it was nice talking to me. 

I’d see him around school but would be much too nervous to talk to him. 

I ended up dating Ryan for a week and going for my first date. I gave my first kiss to that guy. It was cool having that experience but he was irritating so I’m glad that one didn’t last long. 

He also almost kicked “Jake”. That was the day I broke up with him. 


Chapter 7

Meanwhile, I’d become quite the social butterfly. I started hanging out with stoners, and smoker weed on multiple occasions. However, my grades stayed fine and it didn’t seem to affect me too much. That fell out due to my foster sister snitching on me knowing who I was hanging out with.

I was also reconnected with my biological father via CPS, so I began talking to him online at this time. 

One day in November I made a note for my crush. He was speaking with someone. I hid behind the staircase with a note and tried to signal to give it to my crush. I thought both of them saw me so I ran. 

 I began hanging out with the local arthoes. They were curious who I liked, and I didn’t want to say who at first. They didn’t know who I meant when I said I liked a tall, stocky guy with brown hair and pretty eyes. 

One time he passed by us and I said, “that’s the guy I think is kind of cute”. 

My friend at the time turned he head at me and said 

“He’s not attractive” 

“He is” 

“Kaya, what the hell. He’s just like...not attractive” 

Over the next few months it would become apparent I wanted to talk to him. My friend at the time, despite her insults regarding my taste in men, his general appearance and weight, pressured me into talking to him. 

On January 11th in a crowded cafeteria I sat down across from him. It took about 3 months for me to finally get the courage again. I was sweating buckets and reapplied my lipstick before I sat down across from him. He was looking down, picking at his food and I said,

“Hey, sorry to freak you out but, I think you’re kind of cute” 

“No worries”

I learned I got his name wrong. It wasn’t Jake, it was...James...

After a bit of talking I got his number. He had to leave for a class. When I went outside he was waiting for me. Apparently he gave me his old number. 

I texted him the next day on Saturday and we talked a bit about our lives. On Sunday he told me that he couldn’t talk for a while due to things going on in his life. I thought he was simply not interested so I texted him a few days later just saying I hoped he was OK. That upcoming Friday I saw him at an assembly and we spoke. 

He said that he had a lot going on in his life but would date me later that year. Next Friday I saw him and spoke to him again. He seemed to be in better spirits and we ended out going to the park together on Sunday. We kissed and it was evident feelings were involved at that point. My friends dropped me after I started dating him. 

We’d hang out every day at school and we’d become more and more close. We went out to the movies shortly after we began dating  and I made out for the first time in my life. James was and is my only friend. While we’re dating, he’d slim down, shave a bit more and started wearing jeans. I started wearing less pink and quit wearing wigs to hide my natural hair. 

We clicked as people and had chemistry that I had never felt before. I was in love. We were in love. And we are in love. Deeply, madly, in love. 

Who knew the guy that looked kind of angry all the time would be the guy I’d fall madly in love with and be moving in with? 

Meanwhile, my biological father finds out and disowns me because of my boyfriend’s race and my mom’s gone insane,  but at least…..

I’m 18, I have the love of my life, my boo, James, I’m moving in with him this month, and am set to graduate.

34,"On Facebook, I have my account setup very specifically. Only friends of friends can add me, I don’t show where Im at, and I’ve set all my profile pictures to private, except my current one with my boyfriend and I in it, which isn’t even a good photo honestly. Nobody can see my friends, or my interests. I’ve hidden all my posts. Nobody can see my school or anything and it makes me feel so much more secret. I only have Facebook and Instagram, but my Instagram account doesn’t have me in my profile picture. It’s a photo of my cat. I have that account set to private, and I barely even post on there. 

It’s so fucking awesome not being on social media that much. It feels great to have people not know who my boyfriend is, not know my basic shit, not know my likes or friends or what my face really looks like. I love how I don’t post so much anymore, so much pointless shit. I got rid of Snapchat, I only have my boyfriend as my only friend on there. It’s more convenient texting on it. It’s so awkward having your whole life online. I wish more young kids and such knew how good it felt to have your life private. I don’t understand why they feel the need to show off their face constantly, their very personal thoughts, their problems, what they ate, etc. All I do is share memes on Facebook, that’s it.

42,"I am rooted.  Connected to the earth with the dirt that made me whole. That made us all whole. I sway and creak with the wind that flows through my veins. Soaking in the sun, every day. Growing for years, learning about the nature of existence, all while rooted in one place. My outer shell wraps around my form to protect my body from decay and, ultimately, death. I am a breeding ground for animals, a sanctuary for others, and the provider of life.

I am used to create and destroy by the world. I can destroy if I lose my footing with my grounding. Is that my purpose? Or shall I remain calm and timid, to create life and bring new possibilities? Examining my experiences as each unfolds beneath my shield. 

My shadow embraces the traveler looking for a break. I rejoice, and I give back. I leave some apples to feed and rehydrate the traveler. They are weary and eagerly indulge in my fruits. They then discover the potential I have. 

They create complexities, foods, drinks, structures, tools, weapons, mathematics, physics, and books. All to which I am pleased, but I also see myself fleeting. With each invention the traveler scrapes away at me, taking a larger and larger chunk each time. Until I am sick or unable to provide the traveler will continue to take, rarely giving back.

I see my brothers and sisters being used as well. But wait...I see new brothers and sisters too. STRONG brothers and sisters. Fed by these travelers. I am filled with excitement and happiness! Yet, I only have that taken away after seeing the traveler use them, just like they used me. 

I am growing sick now. No longer producing, no longer useful for the traveler. They cut me loose from my roots. Leaving me to burn among other fallen siblings. They took all that was good and created the world the way they saw it, for them. They did not look at the harmony of life, of the system that was already in motion. The traveler took a gesture of kindness and helpfulness and used, abused, then neglected me. Nothing in return. 

And here I lay, burning away. I pray to find myself again away from this awful place. Somewhere that may seem that they are not a part of that place. The traveler must stay here, on my old, dying earth. Never to be exposed to any other innocent life that has no intention of harm. They must stay.",03May2019,2

did you know I didn't do anything wrong? did you know this is the worst thing anyone has ever done to me in my life? 

I'm going to come out better. I hope you do too but Jesus why is that my train of thought when I can't wait for you to figure that out anymore. I need to stop thinking about you right now right now right now. I can never be with someone who did this to me because of fear. 

i thought you were the one. i loved you with all my heart. that's why this sucks so fucking bad. I'm sitting here with a clean conscious waiting on you to figure your shit out but now that this happened I can't even do that

when shit got real you got going. I wonder if deep down you knew I was pregnant and was scared of the consequences. Wanted to make it my fault. Wanted to scarlet letter me. embarrass me and leave me scared and alone

apparently at least 3 months pregnant. with your baby. no one else has even fucked me without protection. i don't know why I thought you were different because you have shown me you're not just the same.. You're worse. And to think I ever wanted a real one with you when this is how you treat me and our mutual mistake together I'm so sad

 I was so vulnerable with you. I don't want anyone there but you but your thinking is so cloudy no words left to change it. I fought for you. I fought for us I'm sorry we went about it so wrong though I was not there I am pregnant I have been too high too drunk too crazy too full of anxiety too sensitive but what can you expect out of a 3 month pregnant girl what can you expect when you go against everything you go against me and you go against all the moral fiber I thought you had


you have done such irreparable damage I have no idea if we could even glue the pieces together even if you wanted to. I keep telling myself that I don't want that. I'm really really scared. the only one I trusted like this is you. 

abandoned. worst case scenario. you have left me in the worst manner no matter how good I was to you and how patient and trusting and risk taking with y o u you have no unconditional love.

I can't believe YOU said that to me you have NO idea. my body is carrying your weight and the weight of the world and my heart still aches for you only. stupid

you. everything to me in such a short period of time. you. special. But now this. what the fuck are you to me now. what is life after you and after us. why did you make it so we can't go back ever",03May2019,2

Though I've yet to have anyone particularly close to me that has passed away, as of recently I've been realizing more and more the inevitability of death for the ones around me and for myself.  Which is odd considering that for most of my life so far I've viewed death as peaceful, something to almost look forward to in a way. But now it seems more difficult than ever to accept, as though my mind can't seem the grasp the concept of non-existence. And since no one close to me has passed away yet, I'm not sure how I'll react when someone I care for inevitability does die.

Some coffee and sit on my porch. It was nice. I felt comfortable at night, cozy even. 
Not for whatever reason, I feel sadness and impending doom. Maybe it’s because the temperatures here in the last two weeks have dropped, while it was in the high 90’s for a bit. I’m not sure. 

My anxiety and depression have been curve balls this season, but I think mostly due to stress. So I’m trying not to feel like this is permanent. It will pass. 

I just wish I had the motivation to do things no matter what the sun was like. I’ll stop certain activists because I feel too disorganized without the sunlight. I dunno. Maybe if my back yard was actually livable, I could go out there and sit and have a nice time at night. I really miss being able to do that. Get on the hammock, stargaze.

When I woke up I realized that sometime during the night I had cursed out my ex gf and now she may be filing for a civil restraining order which would be searchable and would absolutely murder my job searches.

I have borderline personality disorder and I’m 10 days from graduating, I’m going to have an intervention with my Dad tomorrow to figure out a mental health plan moving forward so the path to recovery was so close this time. 

I want nothing to do with my ex gf I already blocked her on social media and removed everything I could of her yet she still very well may legally serve me and ruin my job potential. I just want to move forward and I apologized for the swearing and I even showed screenshots that I did in fact delete everything. I am a flawed person but I’m trying so hard to be better and I was so close this time around.

I already told my close friends to call the police if I do get served cause I feel like if I get that envelope I’m gonna be an absolute danger to myself, I haven’t left my house in 3 days, it’s currently 4 am and I haven’t had more than 2 hours of sleep since I was aware that I might be getting served because I am sick and paranoid. 

I’m mentally ill and I just want this to be over with and I am not a threat to anyone else other than myself. I’m scared, I’m flawed, but I wouldn’t hurt a fly. I just want to move forward, college was one of the worst 4 years of my life and I’m not even attending graduation I just want to close the book and move forward. I’m starting my new job the next day but if she actually escalates this issue my job may be long gone.

I also live 50 minutes away from my girlfriend and my Job is an hour away from my girlfriend so I just don’t know why she thinks I’m a threat to her when I want nothing to do with her and am actively seeking treatment.

56,"So this is only my second post, but I’ve been thinking about this topic a lot recently. I’m 20 years old and live a pretty basic life. Boring even. I’ve never been the talkative type... Some would say I’m introverted, but I don’t think this is the case. I had a very bad acid trip almost 8 months ago and since then I’ve realized a lot about myself. I thought about all of the things I’ve done that I no longer agree with and this lead to a lot of built up guilt. To the point I started to hate who I am. I find it hard to laugh or simply smile at anything and it eats me alive. I used to write music and loved doing it at one point, but now I’m just very uninterested in anything. I have no motivation during the day and rarely get excited about anything anymore. I find myself wanting to sleep a lot because of this. I don’t like listening to music or feel anything from listening too it. I find it hard to start and carry on quality conversations even with my girlfriend/friends. I want to take my girlfriend on quality dates and have fun with her living in the moment, but I can’t get behind anything enough. I want to be a happy person, but now I question if I even know what happiness feels like anymore. I want to be able to entertain people and laugh at things that are supposed to be funny. I ask a lot of pointless meaningless questions because I find it hard to add anything to a conversation. I used to have so many dreams and aspirations and goals... Now I feel like a shell. I have a blank face most of the time, and lately the only feelings I’m able to feel are sadness and emptiness. I just want to enjoy living again and love all of the simple pleasures life has to offer, but don’t know how. I’m sorry if this is random and all of the place. I felt like venting to someone. Anyone.

57,"I was with a friend and we were having a very casual conversation and as he's talking I started cooking up a weird lie that I just wanted to convince him. I was going to tell him after a couple of minutes but I just kept going further and further and I forgot about it until later that day when I watched him explain it to someone over the phone and sell it *just* as passionately as I did. Watching him tell it was like watching your child grow up, move out of the house, and start a life as their own because as hilarious as it was for some reason it almost just made me proud. He didn't say someone told him, and he definitely made the story his own. After he got of the phone I told him and we both laughed at how ridiculous it was but who knows what he told the person on the phone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I figured that if you want to tell a ridiculous lie that it should sound exactly like a ridiculous truth.  Andy Milonakis theme song sung by Queen came almost unnervingly natural. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The explanation for this lie kind of went like this:**

The original version of Andy Milonakis was by Freddie Mercury during their third or fourth album when Freddie was starting to get a bit more experimental and the ""Andy Milonakis"" character from the song was one of Freddie's alter-egos.  It was supposed to be silly and stupid, and most people didn't like it when it came out because it was honestly not one of their best songs. 

So the guy that *PLAYS* Andy Milonakis was just some random thirty something year old guy that picked his name *BECAUSE* the Freddie Mercury song. You know, kind of like how Lady Gaga was after their other song. Anyway, the Andy Milonakis kind of just plays the character from the song, a weird and goofy kid, then he covered the song and nobody really caught on to what he was doing cause it was so weird and pre-internet. 

&amp;#x200B;

TO SUMMARIZE: 

I lied told my friend a ridiculous lie because I can, he believed it. Right before I told him that it was a pointless lie, he told somebody else the story very passionately. No one is angry or hurt, but hopefully that dumb story is making it's way to more people out in the world.",03May2019,2
58,"So I had my first experience with it today, I’m a 23 y/o M. I have severe anxiety of anything doctor related and only had to get an endoscopy. Anyways they held the mask firmly over my face and I really REALLY disliked the sensation straight away and started writhing a little and trying to not breathe it in. Was not enjoyable, did not smile and I didn’t become talkative just dead silent. I wouldn’t say in pain, but definitely big discomfort. I heard the heart rate (or was is oxygen intake?) monitor start going extremely rapid then completely flat line while the nurse went from cheery to frantically telling me to breathe while I kept repeating loudly “F**k, F**k, *F..K” while crying. Now I’m dreading ever having to get it again, and the whole ordeal was way worse than I anticipated even with my anxiety considered. I guess I didn’t realise how much of a procedure it really was, I wasn’t aware I’d have to change into a hospital gown and be carted about, and then going straight into a room with 6-8 doctors/nurses and machinery was extremely foreign. I managed to keep it together for a while and lost my cool the second I had the happy gas. It felt like it disrupted any of the peace I managed to scrape together and sent me into panic mode trying not to flail.

I facebook stalked an estranged family member and got myself angry and sad all over again about the things that caused the rift.

Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way.

67,"*Created this account because this is a very personal issue for me. I tied to include as much detail as possible in the hopes it will help in finding an answer, but I am in such a bad place right now.*

I'm 19, and am about to attend 2nd year at University.

I am in so much physical and mental pain every day. My body wakes me up at 6am, I am nearly always nauseous and tight chested. I am now incredibly susceptible to overthinking, general anxiety and very intense paranoia.

*Before I talk about the trigger for my sudden behavioural change, you should know these things about me before I suddenly changed:I always suffered from low self esteem, and have always been more on the neurotic side, particularly around social situations. That said I managed to pull through with the anxiety and can now just about navigate social situations. People now go as far as to call me ""cool"" which is something I never expected. My father was an alcoholic and used to constantly be angry, anxious and worried about everything. As a result without intending to, I now overthink everything to compensate.*

The trigger for my sudden behavioural shift is my first and only love so far. She is incredibly attractive and lives in Spain. After knowing each other for over a year, I flew to Spain one month ago to visit her for a couple days. For the first time ever I kissed and had sex. My trip to Spain I look back as the best days of my life, as both her and I were incredibly sweet affectionate towards each other. The only downside back then was that when having sex, often I would get too nervous and overthink it, meaning I couldn't be in the moment and satisfy neither myself or her. That said, she still really likes me. Next to her however, I always feel pathetic and inadequate.

**After my trip to Spain however was when my psyche when completely downhill.**

Despite us being the same age, I had absolutely no experience with girls, and she had been in several relationships in the past. **She has reached a point in her life where she wants to be free of commitments and just have fun**. Me on the other hand, have never experienced any true affection from anybody beyond my family, and so **I desperately want a close intimate relationship**, even a long distance one.

She knows I want a relationship, and I know she does not want one. She also established that we are not mutually exclusive and does not mind if I hook up with other girls. We are trying to plan times we can see each other again in the future, because she wants to take it slowly with me. This is possibly the start of something great.

Despite these realities, I am trying so hard to cope with the fact that I am not in a relationship, and that we are not mutually exclusive. **I'm trying so hard to see it as an opportunity to let go of any serious commitment and be free, but I feel as though I am barely able to hold it together and on the verge of collapse.** Three weeks after Spain, I got diagnosed with **Generalised Anxiety Disorder**and am now on anti-anxiety medication. It still ought to take about another week or two for the meds to kick in. I also just started to see a therapist, but it has only been 2 sessions so nothing has been properly discussed yet.

My rational part can see that you cannot predict the way relationships work, or control the other person's wants and needs. You need to accept the way things are, count your blessings and keep moving forwards with your life. However, **my irrational part has never been so vocal before** and has made me also realise that on an emotional front, what I truly want in a relationship is absolute control over that person. I want to use them as my cuddle teddy bear, my pet for emotional support. I want to know everything they do and micromanage them. Any time she tells me what she's up to (i.e something that is beyond my control) such as clubbing, having drinks, going to the gym - **I immediately feel jealous, angry and spiteful**. I've had to delete my Instagram because I was only using it to check up on her stories. I even had to refrain myself from checking to see what posts she liked.

All I think about is her all day, and my emotions are so out of whack I severely struggled with exam revision, resulting in mediocre exam performance. **I have no desire to do anything I used to enjoy anymore**, and would be quite content just lying in bed all day slowly starving to death. I have to force myself to get out of bed and see friends. But even with friends I get completely detached because my mind drifts back into its anxious state, meaning I often put on a fake funny happy persona with others. I have also **tried meditation** twice a day for a few weeks now, but my irrational thoughts and feelings are too powerful to be suppressed. I have also been **working out** every day for a few weeks in the hopes it would help me. Working out makes me feel momentarily better for about 5 minutes before my madness kicks in again.

She knows that I'm not relaxed about it but **has no idea of the extent of my madness**, because I try incredibly hard to mask it during video calls with her. **I don't want to scare her away since it is still early stages**. She summarised the situation perfectly in the following text:

""I think that we should chill about this stuff.I mean, we should just let things happen.It’s good to talk about what we feel and what we want to do.But we are not in a hurry""

**I want my brain to accept this, because she is being perfectly reasonable!!**

I am unable to relax or enjoy life or take everything less seriously. **I honestly do not feel like a functioning rational human being** since I flew over to Spain to see her for those few days. It's as if 70% of myself is messed up. Ultimately, since falling in love, I feel empty and corrupted inside. **I feel awful and scared that I have to put up with such an irrational brain and creepy wants.**

This is what my rational part tells me I ought to do:

*Start to let go of her , and enjoy my life. Possibly start dating other women. We keep seeing each other and see what happens in the far future.*

Ultimately, in an ideal world where I can relax... *I want to be happy with myself and comfortable with my life (as she is with her's), and have flings with other girls. I want my long distance ""Significant Other"" to be a nice little bonus on the side whom I have warm affections towards. I don't want to get emotionally caught up.*

**Anyway, my question is: What do I do? I laid out what I ""ought to do"", but my (currently dominant) emotional irrational part refuses to accept this.**

**If you have been in a similar situation to this had have hindsight, what helped you shake off this behavioural shift?**

Thanks for taking the time to read this and apologies if I come across as unhinged, I'm getting very desperate and honestly wish I was normal.

**TL;DR: unable to cope with irrational thoughts and feelings since hooking up with this girl who does not want any relationship.**",03May2019,1

71,"So, I'm currently a college student in my junior year of college. I have four sisters who are around my age (21- 25) and pretty much none of them are financially stable or have a place of their own, except recently one. I'm doing work study at my school and get paid about $200 - $300 (if I get extra hours) every two weeks, but I have to pay $186 dollars every month, on top of buy groceries for myself and pay for laundry. So, even though I'm making decent money, I still have other things to pay for. 

Now, of course, I don't mind helping them out every now and then and to be fair, they usually don't ask for much (usually $10 - $30), but what frustrates me is that it seems like they don't know how to budget well. I understand things pop up, for example both of my sisters just asked me for money back to back (yesterday and today) which is why I'm posting this now. But, since I know my sisters, and I know they like to buy things that could wait till later down the line, it makes me feel aggravated when they ask, but there's also that guilt if I don't. 

One of by sisters has trust issues where she feels like people don't always have her back, including family. The other, I know has the capabilities to do what she needs to do (they both do), but she does not know how to resist the temptation of buying things. I'm not perfect, I slip up on occasion myself, but I can afford to do so and I make sure it won't affect anything else. These two, on the other hand, have to pay to get to work, pay rent, etc. yet end up asking me for money because they're short or their job didn't send their checks on time. I understand the check thing, but at the same time, I feel that if they saved up like they need to, then they would be able to counteract these situations. I don't know, am I being too harsh? I don't want to straight up tell them no, but maybe I should so that I'm not enabling them to keep thinking they'll always have a backup.",03May2019,8

I thought this news might be worthy of a text to my mother and sister. Both called me rather than return my simple text. And neither of them even mentioned it. Not even once. It’s like my text just reminded them that I am alive and available for them to rant about themselves to. 

My sister proceeded to talk about herself and her round the world holiday in detail I’ve already heard for an hour an a half. Going on about her business seats and how they better be flatbeds with no regard to the fact that I earn less in a week than she does in a day. 

And my mother simply complained that my sister is a terrible daughter and I should tell her to be a better daughter. And tells me what I “should do” in regards to every aspect of my life unsolicited. 

I’m an auditory receptacle for their endless self obsessed diatribes. I could vanish and they’d only notice a month later when they’d realize they hadn’t been able to talk about themselves with me for hours on end. I just sit there and say “yep”, “yes” etc and they don’t even notice. 
If I were to say “do you realize in this entire conversation you haven’t asked a single question about me? They would lash out and hang up. 

Why do I even answer the phone?",03May2019,635
75,"I was a essentially a prisoner in my own home for a year and half. And even now (sometimes) I wish I could talk to the man who abused me.

I will try and break it down as simply as I can-- but to say, ""I was in an abusive relationship,"" isn't the whole story. It's more complex.

In 2014 I lived in a very remote and very isolated northern community (I'm talking sub-arctic, literally). The community consisted of maybe 900 people at that time. I was young and small and pretty. So, naturally when a tall handsome man around my age mysteriously showed up in town, I was intrigued. His story was that he was in the US military for years but suffered an existential break-down after his relationship with his ex-girlfriend fell apart. The military was hard on him, he thought about suicide and wrote about it in his journal. The military found his journal and he was discharged from the military. He said he drove all the way up north to kill himself. 

I'm very maternal. When I heard of his story I immediately wanted to help him. I offered him a place to stay on my couch. I helped him meet friends. I would cook him food.

My roommate was on vacation when I offered this guy (I'll call him G) a place to crash. I knew I had to find him another place by the time my roommate came back. But before I knew it, after a couple glasses of wine G and I played footsies. And to me, a good game of footsies doesn't necessarily mean anything. But he pulled me into the kitchen almost immediately and started going off about how he has ""rules"" about relationships. A little wine drunk, I thought this was his way of asking me out. But-- apparently this was actually me agreeing to be in a relationship so volatile that it would take getting G deported to escape from. 

So. Six months into the relationship is when G started slamming my head against things. He also got fired from his under-the-table job by showing up to his workplace high on acid. He also almost certainly cheated on me. And all while I couldn't get him to leave my house. He would only beat me when my roommate wasn't home. And would be highly manipulative when I would threaten to tell someone. He would immediately tell me that he would go kill himself or that he had 'no other place to go' in -50C. So I put up with it for much longer than I should have. 

But, besides his abuse. I still feel like he was the only person I could talk to on an intellectual level. And I'm not saying I'm super brilliant or that he was either. I just can't get people to understand a lot of what I'm thinking. I'm not amazing with words, maybe. But he always understood everything I threw at him. He said that it was mutual. I know that the way I feel might be residual effects of his manipulation. But, damn. Sometimes I just miss him.

Anyways, we moved to a slightly bigger city eventually. I gathered the courage to call the police. He was arrested. Thank Jeesus I had medical records of physical trauma to back up my statements and he was deported (he was an American living in Canada).

That's all I really needed to get off my chest. I feel ashamed and guilty. I'm in a very healthy relationship with someone who doesn't abuse me now. I love him a lot. There is no question. But I still miss conversations I had with someone who essentially imprisoned me in my own home. The end.",03May2019,1
76,"Like I volunteer in a class for students with special needs, and this teacher here is talking about fillers in vaccines and how there are chemicals in vaccines, and saying things like ""how is it ok"", and it's just...with all the ""vaccines cause autism"" discourse, and the fact that it's borderline political, I feel like it's inappropriate? Especially in this environment. One, we're with students with low-functioning autism, and two, we're in a school, where you should keep political discourse to yourself anyway.

78,"So first of all let me say I’m female, 21 soon to be 22. I moved out of my parents house when I was 19 to move to the city where I went to school for a year and got my college diploma. I then moved back home with my parents for the summer and went back to the city later that fall for a few months to take a few more courses on the field I’m interested in. Both these times I moved out I was totally fine and happy being independent. 

For the past year and a half or so I lived with my parents again while I worked in the field I went to school for. I needed to live with them while I got on my feet and made some more money so I could support myself. I guess I should mention our home is in a beautiful area on an acreage. 

Just this past week I moved in with my boyfriend in a basement suite (in my home town) just for the summer while he’s back home from college. Don’t get me wrong I do love every minute of it. But for some reason this time I’m missing my home so incredibly much. 

I do miss my parents but the biggest thing I miss is my cat, and that I’ll be missing all the beautiful things about summer on that acreage. I miss the quiet and privacy, and I’ll miss hearing the frogs at night as we have a creek nearby the house. I’ll miss the birds chirping every morning and watching the leaves come out and witnessing everything turn green. I grew up in that home and it’s so hard for me to not live there knowing it’s only about 15 minutes away from me currently. Yes obviously I can visit but it isn’t the same. 

I just feel so pathetic because first of all, I’m only moved out for a few months until my boyfriend goes back to college. And second, I should be feeling happy that I get a chance to be independent. I mean I’m almost 22 it’s time for me to stop being attached to my childhood home and to grow up. 

I’m aware of how dumb and “first world” this sounds. I’ve just found myself tearing up a bit every day because I miss the peace and content that home brought to me over the summer months. 

Anyways, if you made it this far on my spoiled and whiny little post I thank you. I just needed to get this out somewhere.",03May2019,1

81,"I go to a small school where most of my classmates have been with me since the third/fourth/fifth grades. We’re seniors now and will be graduating in June. 

Up until the 10th grade, I was a major bookworm and it was common knowledge to everyone who knew me. I’d never go anywhere without a book. My name basically became synonymous with “someone who loves to read” Reading helped me through some extremely painful situations where I struggled a lot with my mental health. 

From the 11th grade onwards, I got super busy with school. When I wasn’t busy with school, I was too emotionally drained to do anything but sleep. I still love reading but I no longer feel like my love of reading defines me. I’ve grown so much and learned so much about myself in the last two years. I’m so much more than just someone who loves books. 

The thing is, I keep a lot of stuff to myself. Nobody really knows what I’ve gone through, and those who do only know the surface details. They have no idea how hard I fight every day to get through everything and how much it affects me emotionally. 

For my piece of the senior mural, I’m having trouble deciding what to paint that represents me. Everyone I’ve asked has suggested I either do something related to books or something matching with my best friend. However, neither of those are things that are *me* and I’m just now realising that nobody, not even my closest friends, really knows who I am.

84,"In a nutshell, I hate my existence. I do nothing, accomplish very little, and hate myself all the time. So, what if come tomorrow morning; I start practicing acting by choosing a character that is the total opposite of who I am and just stick to that person? Can someone's personality change? Am I the way I am because the person I am, like the personality that is me, is this lazy, unmotivated fat nobody? 

The perfect character is going to get up early, do stretches, brush her hair, meditate, make her bed, NOT CHECK SOCIAL MEDIA first thing, NOT DRINK 3 CUPS OF COFFEE before 10 am. This perfect character is going to do some work, then leave for work, then go to the gym at lunch time, then get back to work and have lunch; and spend the evening working on side projects that are going to secure her an internship somewhere awesome. She's not gonna get in bed to watch tv shows with her lap top on her belly; No. She's gonna watch stuff sitting up so it's not so comfy. And then she's gonna read while drinking tea, then night routine and then bed. 

The perfect character says yes to things that she's never done before and no to things she doesn't have time to. She's strong enough to apologize and admit that she's made mistakes, and secure enough to stand up straight and no shy away from how she looks. She feels proud of herself for being able to do things, even if she's not doing them yet. She has hobbies, creative hobbies that actually produce things. She has friends, and not just people whom she's friendly with. She goes out with her friends almost every weekend, and sometimes those weekend outings turns into roadtrips. Her instagram is NOT filled with suicidal posts and Radiohead Creep lyrics about hating herself. 

She's writing the book she's always wanted to write, she's not drowning her boredom (despite having a shitton of things to do) and stress with FOOD, JUNK FOOD and more JUNK. She's not shutting her brain off with tv show binge sessions, rewatching Charmed for the 10th time and actually legitimately deadass restating all the dialogue from memory. No, she doesn't waste her time like that. Instead, she goes to the gym and is friendly with people there and high fives people and loves looking at herself and acoomplishments in the mirror. When she's not in gym and she needs a break from her own mind, she picks up her camera and does the thing she loves most: creating stories through images. 

She takes online courses so that she never settles for being mediocre, and actually finishes them. She takes acting classes to meet different people and help her social anxiety. Every night before going to sleep, she feels accomplished and satisfied with herself. Even if not achieving her dreams right away, she's at least doing something about it.

88,"My soon to be husband and I had a long talk the other night. Its started as a conversation about spending time together and how I enjoy going out and doing things and spending time with others or just him. If we do go out it's usually with our mutual friends or his. ( I think hes doesnt like my friends)  Furthermore, while he likes to wind down and play video games on weekends, it often leaves me to entertain myself. I usually dont have a problem entertaining myself but I do get bored and wish he would go out with me more. 
     This led to a discussion of dependance vs independence. He feels like I am not happy on my own and rely on others (him) for entertainment, fulfillment. The comment that really struck me is that "" I just dont think you really like yourself.""

It really hurt... mostly because it's probably true. He doesnt say things like this lightly and the fact that I have been upset about it for the past two days goes to show how that I may have self esteem issues. 

I have been going to counseling because I have lashed out etc. in the past and treated the people closest to me poorly. My counselor says that I have issues with shame... and it makes sense.

In our fight I was talking to her frankly but with honesty that she’d be hurting me in ways and the way she was acting was mean or awful even

She’d gossip and put down other people EVERY DAY, and that was disgruntling to listen to especially when I knew these people and they were nothing like she’s make them out to be. And the annoyances she had with them were enough to make her amplify those issues and project these people as harbingers of doom and destruction in her life. The circle jerk attitude of that group she was the unspoken leader of wasn’t good either.

Everyone either agreed or pissed her off and if you annoyed her that wasn’t good.

Anyway, in that fight I mentioned how her gossiping was mean and pointless and the response she gave me still throws me off every time I think about it.

Then the next day I emailed  her again and asked her could I get a bus pass for the first week of work as I worked a week in hand and apologised again also about my misunderstanding and she replied ‘that’s fine graham, don’t worry, if you want to come in to office ‪before 5pm today‬ I can sort this out for you’. Later that day I  went in to my advisor and I sat there about 10 mins (I thought she’d of wanted rid of me quick tbh?) she asked me about getting to work and how much it usually costs etc. I felt bad and there was an awkward silence as she was writing the paper form out for the bus pass, so I apologised again she then said 'it's alrigggghht' (but sounded annoyed) I then explained my manager questioned me about it and she seemed surprised and said 'did he?'

100 press ups.
100 squats.
3 minute plank.
100 lunges.
100 jumping jacks.
No time limit and just smash out as many as I could.

Through lots of tough breakups, denials and sob stories. I found the one for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Fate is a topic up for discussion, you can't really tell if it's real or not. Science can neither confirm nor deny it. We basically know nothing about the fourth dimension, time, so no one can say for sure what is real. 

I believe I had a meeting with the goddess of fate on just this one occasion, or occasions to be precise.   
You see, I have reason to believe in fate. 

I met my ex by chance, my one friend just happened to bring a friend from 4 hours by train away to a LAN party. This friend just happened to have a twin sister that by chance had locked herself out of their home and forgot he was away from home. So she called, my curious ass decided to take the phone out of this friend of a friend's hand, and things just kind of went on from there.   
This is all real, in retrospect even I have a hard time believing this too.

We met up a couple of times and all of these times, were moments of pure ecstasy, joy, and passion.   
But things never really worked out, she couldn't handle the distance, and I couldn't handle losing her. I lost myself along the way. 

Fast forwards a couple of months, and I get back up on my feet, and I feel well again.   
I found myself using the same friends' that had introduced me to his friend, and in turn my ex, phone. During this voyage of my friends' Snapchat, I found myself chatting with this, blonde haired, blue eyed, short girl. Just like my ex, weirdly close even in the name, Sara instead of Saga. 

I didn't really know how I felt about this, yet I found myself adding her. We got nowhere, she wasn't the rebound, not the next big thing. But she was the spark of something great. 

You see, during kindergarten, this one girl had a crush on me. But when I moved to another city (just ten minutes away), we forgot about each other. 

She had seen me once when I exited the train to go to school in the town I used to live in, whilst she went on the train to go to another school in another town.   
She recognized me straight away. 

This is where Sara comes into play, you see, they were classmates.   
This girl had seen me on Saras Snapchat. Sara encouraged her to add me, and so she did. 

Believing she was someone else I added her, started chatting until I realized she wasn't who I thought she was. 

Not so surprisingly, I had forgotten about her, but she hadn't. Although that did not matter. We spoke nonetheless.   
After a couple of weeks, we met up. A month passes and we're official. 

Fourteen months ago I got into a serious relationship with the woman of my dreams. I was the first one for her. She's into art, she dedicates her life to the very concept of an artistic spirit. It amazed me back then, and it amazes me as of this moment too. We've loved, laughed, and cried. We have hurt each other and made ourselves whole again. I can with confidence say that she is the love of my life.

She has memories of us from 14 years back, yet I was the one to find my way back to her.

If this friend of a friend hadn't come to this one LAN party, and his twin hadn't locked herself out of her home, and forgot about him leaving. If I hadn't used the same friends' phone and met this one girl similar to my ex. If she hadn't gone to the same class as this one particular girl, whom I had met 14 years ago at the time. None of this would've happened.

We met at the fourteenth year of our initial meeting as children, and 14 just so happens to be my lucky number since my birth.

I've never been too bothered coming home after work, or a Friday night staying in watching a movie. Since being ghosted however, it's almost taken the veil off of my life and I can't stand anything right now. I hate being at home. I can't stand being at work. I do everything I can do all day to avoid being home on weekends. I hate the mediocrity and purposeless life I have right now. I'm just...existing. For no particular reason. There hasn't been anything I've found that can help me forget this girl. After only 1 date, I still hope every text is her, and it's been 3 weeks.

Now this guy is slacking off BIG time during his shift ... because he can get away with it. And good for him. I have no problem with it. I slack off even more. 

Well, one of the things he does is play video games and watches movies (movies that he brings in) on the company devices (the devices werent meant for employees to use). The games for the video game console are provided by the employer (for clients). 

He's been playing too many video games and not watching enough dvds. He brings in his own dvds from a free source outside of his workplace (the workplace doesnt provide DVDs). 

That means I can't borrow the dvds (he leaves behind) and watch them on my shift. So, what I did was I opened the video game console and temporarily disabled it so it wouldnt work. That way he will bring in more DVDs to watch. Which allows me to watch them too.

112,"This is going to be brutal.
My head is a mess right now. I don't even know where to begin...
My childhood was shit..we moved around a lot, never long enough to make real friends where ever we landed. My mothers husband (who ended up legally adopting me, but I'll never acknowledge or refer to him as my dad) molested me from the age of 9 or 10 until I was 17 at which point I moved out to get away from him. He wasn't only molesting me, but my younger sister (11-15) and my oldest brother (not sure how old he was..) Which I didnt know at the time. My mom was the bread winner in our house so she was always gone 8-12 hours a day. We were trapped there with him 24/7 365...he convinced my mom to let him homeschool us so he'd have even more access to us individually and wouldn't have to worry about any of us talking to people about what was happening behind closed doors...anyway fast forward a few years..he got really sick because he was addicted to pain pills, which ultimately ended up killing him. Before that happened, I became pregnant with my oldest son at 18. He did not like that at all..tried to bribe me with a shopping spree if I got an abortion. I said no, and as sick and almost dead as he was, tried to manipulate me into having sex with him because ""having sex with me being pregnant already means I can't get pregnant again.."" 

A few months before my son was born, he finally died. I never felt so relieved in my life. My mom still had no idea what had been going on all these years. She still didn't know about this for another 3 or 4 years..I'll never forget that phone call with her. Saying it out loud for literally the first time ever in my life made it so real. We cried on the phone for hours. He had been putting her through her own hell which was why she was always working and gone. That was the first and last time we ever spoke about that. 

I'm 30 years old now, and I still feel disgusted by my childhood. I have no idea who I am outside of this trauma..and that's probably why my mind is always a mess. I am disgusting. I am embarrassed. I am still so deeply hurt. I have tried to bury this..so many times..and everytime I do..it comes right back up. I tried to forgive him, but how do you forgive someone who stole so much from you? How do you just accept that? I've met so many victims of sexual abuse and they seem much happier than I am..why can't I let this go? I need this to not be so painfully present in my life anymore..it's starting to spill over into other relationships in my life.
I've never told ANYONE about these feelings or my childhood.

116,"I had a group interview on Wednesday with my top choice grad program that I applied to, after already being rejected from 3 out of the 5 programs I applied to, and being waitlisted on another. I have felt like an underdog through the entire application process because I don't have as much professional/volunteer experience as I believe other applicants have, but I believe that I came across as genuine and engaging in my interview. The professor who interviewed said they were in the last week of interviews, so we should expect a phone call today (or possibly tomorrow). I'm not sure she'll call even to tell me I didn't get in.

The level of nervousness has reached the point that I am struggling to do relaxing activities that I enjoy, like playing video games, listening to music, or watching TV. I would have so preferred getting an e-mail, so I could just look at it when I'm ready and not have to react on the spot. I'm trying so hard not to get my hopes up so I'm not crushed if I get a rejection. Today's my day off of work and I have plans tonight, and I hate that I'm wasting the day just being nervous. I also don't want to ruin other peoples' good time later if I am really disappointed. 

I'm trying to remind myself that I did a good job with the interview, and that even if I don't get in this year, I can try again. Just getting interviews with two schools was already a major win. I was in the top 40 out of over 100 applicants to the school I got waitlisted to, so that means I'm not total crap. I've learned a lot about this process and I know what I can do to strengthen my applications. I still just want this so badly. I want to move forward in my life and start actually working toward the career of my dreams.

122,"Life Help! First Post. I am new to reddit all together and have no clue what’s going on but I could use some universal, unbiased advice...

My father is at an inevitable point of going into a nursing home facility. My father is my best friend. He was the best man at my wedding. I need for him to be happy and comfortable. I blame myself for not being ready for this all. I knew it all too well. I could really use  advice for how to handle this all emotionally, financially, ethically, pragmatically, etc. 

My dad is 75 and has dimensia. He contracted a UTI last night and was hospitalized. They suggested a facility for short term rehab and re-evaluate on Monday. There is basically no money in the family. Non the less, The area in which he lives in NY has really crappy facilities. I worked in one, have many friends/family that have worked in several and it’s terrible. That is actually the problem; it is just a job to most people in that area and these facilities employee a lot of people in an area without many jobs. I watched the 3 grandparents I’ve ever had die in nursing homes after changing as people. 

My dads home life is not ideal (it’s complicated) he basically lives by himself and this is almost the better option. To be honest I’ve been hoping for this process to start; I was just hoping for more time and planning. I though his quality of life would be much better. I live in NC currently and he is in NY, almost 12 hrs away. Most of my immediate family is in his general area of NY but  as stated the facilities in that area are atrocious and no one is able to provide the “round the clock” supervision that he really needs. I would bet nursing homes and other facilities in my area of NC are far better but he has so much family up north too, it seems selfish. Also, I have no idea would one would cost be there is no money in the family and I assume a nicer place=more money. 

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated. I have grappled with this for a long time coming but I am still not prepared. I was honestly hoping someone could relate and offer some suggestions. Anything. Thanks to you all!",03May2019,1

I was desperate so I kept posting about my symptoms to different forums to no avail until recently I got one saying I should try this product. I bought it out of desperation since my tinnitus, vertigo (my balance was basically nonexistent) and ear pain that rivaled toothache. It cost me 30 bucks but I would of tried anything at that point and drugs didn't really work to bring my symptoms to acceptable levels.

Every time doctors looked at my ear, they said it was retracted, fluid behind it, or the eardrum looked really dull. I looked this up and found out it's something babies usually get, called glue ear, but it can last for years in some people and cause all my symptoms.

So I tried this product (I will name it if anyone's curious) which I used every day for 20 minutes. By the second day, I was getting laundry out the laundry room which is the quietest room in the house and I noticed something was different. My tinnitus was essentially gone!! I wasn't stumbling or losing my balance as bad (which is especially bad if I'm getting out of bed and the only light is coming from my lamp). Beforehand the tinnitus was literally defeaning in silence, I had to have my computer and laptop blaring or I couldn't sleep but even then it took me like 3 hours to fall asleep. Now I can enjoy falling asleep! 

I am seeing an ENT soon and I don't know if I will still need grommets, but that nasty whirring sound basically went from that stand by signal on max volume to an almost silent soft ambient sound that doesn't bother me anymore.

I kinda made someone sad, should've thought more about it, I didn't acknowledge it much and it just went, i think all is good now. No big deal. Also, \[Redacted\] went to US. I remember saying bye that early morning. Came back September.

July 2018:  I got the scholarship.. World Cup binge watching... staying up till 7 am is a common occurrence.. pat some puppies at 7 am once on the garden. Went to the road at 5-6AM.. there was this guy on his 40's on the back of a big truck you waved at. He waved back.. you were at 5-6 am with \[Redacted\]. Football, debate, VFEEFEEEK.  All the things are on 12 btw.. always remember.

August 2018: You know the 27th.. trippy12. Early August was the festival.. drunk there.. You registered for driving license, a lot of sleepless nights, car racing with LRF. 

September 2018: You started college, first semester. 10th of September was new for you. You were hopeful. Then November came, I\`ll talk about it on their category. September was college month. You learned to solve the rubik. And \[redacted\] came home.

October 2018: Lots of learning, sleeplessnes, roommates, and the strong sentiment 122x.. a lot.

November 2018: Individual chess championship.. started well, better than expected. Unproductive... check 11th of October on yt channel. Kinda got better. Strong 122x. 

December 2018: Awesome month, things got sweet. The GPA you wished for.. Things worked out, snow was awesome.. 13 December was very cozy. So was 14 December. You started programming by the end of the month. Doing your project. New Years was approaching.

January 2019: An awesome month, you know what was happening, check youtube. Apart from the \[redactedthing\], you programmed a lot, listened to Joey Diaz podcasts, and just worked on improving your website. 

February 2019: Got sick, moved in with new roommates. Nice roommate stories. Other things you know too.........

146,"He broke up with me a little bit ago. In my heart, in my bones, it is not the end of our story. I will live my life, I will be open to new things, I will love myself. I will not sit around and hope and dream, because I know I don’t have to. And I know that we will come back to each other again someday. It may be a long time from now. And others may come and go. But when you know, you know. ❤️",03May2019,1
147,I’ve been drinking fluids and sleeping regular hours. I don’t feel busy and I’m not getting the shakiness associated with lack of food. I basically feel completely fine. Wtf is going on with me?,03May2019,2
148,"My girlfriend graduated basic training yesterday and I had to travel out of state to see it. Between the hotel, rental car, and miscellaneous expenses like food/gas it cost me nearly a month's pay. 

The day did not go as planned. What should have been an afternoon of relaxation and celebration turn into a day of running errands due to several mishaps. The evening ended with the realization that I no longer wanted to date her.

I want to ask her if she'll be my wife. I know I am not good enough. she's beautiful, smart, strong, and kind. all I want is is to spend the rest of my life striving to be the man she deserves to have beside her.

I traded a month for a day with you Asha, and it was worth every second.",03May2019,24
