0,"I am so calm. The calmest I've been in such a long time. No worries, not a care in the world, I am safe. I feel loved, and cared for, and all it took was for someone to look me in the eyes and tell me everything is going to be okay, and that they love me. They have my back if anything ever goes wrong, and we're in things together. It's taken 4 years... but I am not alone, I am okay. ",12Mar2019,2
1,"First,I know that millennial word is created by previous generation to bashing millennial but I just want to say things about my generation. 

The millennial undoubtedly is misunderstand by baby boomer and media. However, I also dislike the idea off my generation by being too negative toward life. I get it that we have bad economy and uncertain future but we tend to forget that we are the generation that are most educated, have longest life expectation and more tolerate.My generation has tendency to berate someone that has problem not because they deserve it but because they want to feel better about them selves in internet. I'm sure that even baby boomer and Gen Z have different difficulty that they need to solves. By the end of the day, life is not all rainbow and sunshine but life also not gloomy and dark. It's mix of both of them.

I'm sorry if I rant about this but I can withstand the overloading pessimistic idea that demotivated my generation to become better and enclosed them in echo chamber of self destructive",12Mar2019,2

5,"Growing up we didn't have much. We never starved, but we also never took the family vacations that my friends had, or had the latest technology. A family of immigrants, my dad was a janitor and my mom didn't work as she was busy raising me, her youngest, and then her grandkids while my siblings worked. Growing up we didn't have much but we had each other.

My dad passed almost two years ago and I promised myself I would do whatever I could to take care of my mom. I recently got a substantial raise at work and can now easily afford to give her whatever she asks for or needs. My parents were very frugal, and they definitely instilled that quality in me. So even though I still buy my clothes secondhand and cook most of my meals at home, being able to pay my mom's medical bills for her, or replace her 7-year old phone, makes all the hard work so worth it.",12Mar2019,754
7,"
I have body dysmorphic disorder and it manifests itself as severe racial dysmorphia over my appearance like eye color, hair color, hair texture, and particularly skin color. I’ve been suffering from this condition for years. It’s driven me to the consideration of suicide and to literally injuring myself in distress. And no one will acknowledge the pain I feel as real. I have dysphoria over my appearance which is extremely critical and real - just as real as dysmorphia is, and for me all that’s recommended is I seek therapy and medication while people with dysmorphia can be treated with mutilating surgeries like phalliplasty that are validated by the medical establishment. I’m told my condition isn’t real, which is a literal slap in the face, I am real! I’ve sought out extensive therapy and still my feelings of dysphoria over my race and bodily appearance are unchanged. At this point, why can’t we consider it a valid alternative that I could live the race and appearance I would prefer to be? How is this different than a trans person living as a woman? There is a disconnect between my self-perception and my personal feelings just like with a transgendered individual. People claim in defense of transgenderism that you can feel like a woman while you can’t feel like another race. You can feel like another race, however, there’s no biological basis for it. My adopted Asian friend raised by white parents has told me she feels white. My Pakistani therapist has told me since she was raised and born in Virginia Beach she feels white. These are cultural and social reasons where people grow up in one race and feel another race because of upbringing. There are social reasons I hate my racial identity and would prefer another one. There are also psychological, verging even on biological, reasons like what I have as severe dysphoria/dysmorphia that make someone feel they should have another racial appearance. We don’t question or demand that the identities of trans people be biologically valid. We don’t question the claims of people saying they’re a self-made gender, gender fluid or even metaphysical identities like two-spirit. If transgerism is built on biological validity, what biological validity is there to claiming to be two-spirit or a fictional gender? But if I rejected these designations I’d be a bigot.

My argument is simple. Racial dysphoria/dysmorphia is socially, culturally, religiously, and psychologically valid and real. I believe people should be allowed to live life the way they want in a way that brings them happiness. I’m not a terf. If it makes you happy to remove your penis, wear a dress and call yourself a woman then good for you if that’s what makes you happy. We only have one life to live and cannot biologically alter either sex or heriatage, but that shouldn’t stop people from living the lives they would like to achieve even if it means physically altering the body to appear as a different race or gender.",12Mar2019,0

9," There's a guy in my class who's kinda cute. Anyhow, I was at the library studying. Then I thought I'd borrow a book so I go upstairs. I see him and until then, we had never talked in person, I just knew about him but not much. He sees me, smiles at me and says ""hey"" in kind of a suave way? Maybe I'm overthinking, but given that we didn't know much about one another I found his reaction weird. Is it because he might be into me? If he is, I don't know how to flirt. I just sent him instagram follow request but that's dumb and apparently guys don't see that as flirting. So pls help I really don't understand how guys think.

10,"This week has been an odd one for me. I'm always lonely because I have no hobbies, and I have no hobbies because I don't enjoy anything. I'm a 26 year old man who just started college for a degree I don't know if I even care about.  


The video games I play are just to waste time, it feels more like a chore to be awake than anything else. But recently it's been getting worse.   


When I browse reddit on my main account I'll see pictures of happy couples, or even just pictures of old friends on facebook, and it makes me feel like something's wrong. My heart sinks and I feel like I need to take a nap because there is no point in being awake; why should I even get to look at attractive people when I'll never be with one myself?   


Then something even more strange happened today: I was talking with someone I knew a couple of years ago on facebook and her reply to what I said was ""I love you!"" and even though I know it was totally innocuous, I felt something. I stopped walking on campus and I tried not to cry. For a moment I felt like one day somebody really could love me, and then it hurt that much more knowing that I was wrong.   


I don't know what to do. Seeing people makes me feel sad, not going outside makes me feel sad. There doesn't seem to be any good options.",12Mar2019,1
11,"I scored a 1010/1600 on the SAT. This was like pretty much a year ago and I never bothered to re-take it at all. I was so foolish. At the time I was in a bad place mentally. I basically suffered from depression since middle school but it didn't become overwhelming until junior year of high-school.

I guess what I mean to say is I don't ever take into consideration the reality of the situation.

In middle school I used to feel smart, maybe even smarter than most of my classmates so I felt proud. I didn't have many friends and I've always felt lonely and sad but not enough for me to think to take my own life. It got really bad when I went to high-school, especially junior year when I would be taking the SAT. I hated myself, I had little to no self-esteem, no real friends, no actual hobbies, and not much support from my family and just those thoughts that I would be alone forever got me to the point where I would cry myself to sleep just wanting to die. 

I didn't think the SAT to be a big deal even though my school kept stressing it, so I never studied. I guess I was still a child, carefree with no responsibilities. Now I feel like such an idiot. while others are discussing the major colleges they got accepted into, I'm sitting here wondering if I'll even get accepted to a one. I just feel so stupid compared to my classmates now, but maybe I deserved it as a wake up call. There's nothing I can do now but keep moving forward I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

On a side note, I am doing better mentally as I got myself into therapy. It's still a little rough but I have hope it'll get better. Sometimes not so much but it feels good to know that I at least have someone to talk to.",12Mar2019,1
12,"me: 31M / her: 30F

&amp;#x200B;

We started dating almost 6 years ago. At the time, one of the things I admired about her was her work ethic, because it was something that I sorely lacked. She worked overtime at a dead end job every week. I also worked a shitty job but only part time. Another big thing that brought us together was our common struggle with social anxiety. I always hated meeting my previous partners' friends because of this. It felt like a huge weight lifted off my shoulders to be dating someone in the same boat.

&amp;#x200B;

Did I mention that she was (and still is) completely stunning? Seriously, model-like good looks and body to match. This gave me a lot of confidence.

&amp;#x200B;

The past 6 years have been a whirlwind for me, mostly for the better. I traded in my video game obsession for a programming obsession shortly after we started dating. I was lucky enough to make some connections and get hired early at a startup that has now become fairly successful. I'm starting a new job in a couple of weeks making well over six figures. I'm generally a very confident and happy person. All of my previous anxiety has all but washed away. For the first time in my life, I feel like ""myself"".

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, she has barely changed. I fully supported her financially to go back to school. She finished her program more or less at the bottom of the class, I later found out. She was the last to get a mandatory unpaid internship required to graduate, and is one of the few people from her class to not have a job in the field now. I supported her fully for 6 months of not working or going to school to give her time to look for a job. Without much luck, and after a couple of fights, she's back at her old dead end job now. She still has a good work ethic, but she hasn't worked through any of her anxiety issues. I think this is what's killing her chances (whether self sabotage, or otherwise) of advancing her career.

&amp;#x200B;

There are other problems. Sex over the past two years has become non-existent, and I hate to say it, because of me. I still have a very healthy sex drive. I just don't want her. We tried couples counselling for a while with a very well regarded therapist. It went okay. It certainly helped us solve some logistical issues, and I think we are both better partners for it. It didn't help us rekindle the passion.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the years, some of my friends and family have told me I'm too good for her and to end it. I always shut them down. An emotional connection is what really matters, I said. Most of these people have eventually apologized. Now, I can't help but think that they were right. 

&amp;#x200B;

We live in a very expensive city, and I've saved up enough to buy some real estate. I've always dreamed of owning my own place. It feels like a step I shouldn't make with her unless we are on the path to marriage. It also feels wrong that she's not involved in the decision whatsoever.

&amp;#x200B;

There are the other usual problems that I suppose come with a fading mature long term relationship. All of our friends, outside of my work friends, are shared. We've been living together for 3 years. She has nowhere to go and no means to support herself here. Her family lives on the other side of the country, and I don't have a lot of family, so some of them have become my family.

&amp;#x200B;

I still really care about her. There's no doubt she's helped me become who I am now. Often, when I try to bring up some of these issues, or discuss anything long term, she shuts down or starts crying. I've tried to get her to go see a counselor. I've been open about how they've helped me. But I can't force her to go. I'm not sure if I still really care about her as a lover.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm afraid that my life is slipping away here. Unlike six years ago, when I wanted someone who would tolerate my shortcomings and personal issues, now I really want someone who will challenge me to be a better person. I want someone strong who can be an example to my future kids (daughters?).

I also end up getting really frustrated cause I’m always stuck with my family and that I’m never around my extended family members (cousins, uncles, grandparents etc.). I guess it started when I visited my home country after a few years and realised that so much has changed. Until now, this county I’ve been living in still feels foreign, things are good and all but there’s just this strange feeling like I’m holding my breath.

23," I'm not someone who gets angry easily, but I want to cry right now.

You see, Quentin Tarantino and his movies were the reason I decided I wanted to be a filmmaker. After watching his art and learning how he came up from nothing and ended up being one of the greatest film directors of today was what finally made me say ""I want to become a filmmaker"", and using the scolarship I worked so hard to earn on a carreer that focuses on visual mediums.

So you guys can imagine how excited I was when our local film festival announced the man himself, Quentin Tarantino, was going to be in the opening of the event. This was a week ago, me and my friends were all hyped up to the max. A whole week in which I couldn't hold my excitement. I was gonna meet the man who helped me choose the path I chose (or at least see him in person).

Finally, we reach the day before the festival. I rewatch Pulp Fiction out of excitement.

It's 10:12PM right now. I was about to go to bed when the festival decided to announce that Quentin wasn't showing up. It was a lie to proff how powerful the media is (Quentin's arrival reached social media, newspapers, hell, even my grandma knew). You have no idea how angry I got. I almost started crying right there and then. I almost couldn't tell my mom what I just read.

Why? Why did you guys needed to lie? Why crush the hopes of thousands of people? And most importantly, did you guys really thought everyone was gonna go after the shit you pulled?

Needless to say, the backlash already started. Quentin was the reason everyone was going, so now no one is. As simple as that.

27,"I am only 24 years old, yet I have actually already chosen my last tie. It’s the one that I will wear on my funeral a few months from now. It may not match my suit, but I think it’s perfect for the occasion.
The cancer diagnosis came too late to give me at least a tenuous hope for a long life, but I realized that the most important thing about death is to ensure that you leave this world a little better than it was before you existed with your contributions . The way I’ve lived my life so far, my existence or more precisely the loss of it, will not matter because I have lived without doing anything impactful.
Before, there were so many things that occupied my mind. When I learned how much time I had left, however, it became clear which things are really important. So, I am writing to you for a selfish reason. I want to give meaning to my life by sharing with you what I have realized:
• Don’t waste your time on work that you don’t enjoy. It is obvious that you cannot succeed in something that you don’t like. Patience, passion, and dedication come easily only when you love what you do.
• It’s stupid to be afraid of others’ opinions. Fear weakens and paralyzes you. If you let it, it can grow worse and worse every day until there is nothing left of you, but a shell of yourself. Listen to your inner voice and go with it. Some people may call you crazy, but some may even think you‘re a legend.
• Take control of your life Take full responsibility for the things that happen to you. Limit bad habits and try to lead a healthier life. Find a sport that makes you happy. Most of all, don’t procrastinate. Let your life be shaped by decisions you made, not by the ones you didn’t.
• Appreciate the people around you Your friends and relatives will always be an infinite source of strength and love. That is why you shouldn’t take them for granted.
It is difficult for me to fully express my feelings about the importance of these simple realizations, but I hope that you will listen to someone who has experienced how valuable time is. I'm not upset because I understand that the last days of my life have become meaningful. I only regret that I will not be able to see a lot of cool stuff that should happen soon like the creation of AI, or Elon Musk’s next awesome project. I also hope that the war in Syria and Ukraine will end soon.
We care so much about the health and integrity of our body that until death, we don’t notice that the body is nothing more than a box - a parcel for delivering our personality, thoughts, beliefs and intentions to this world. If there is nothing in this box that can change the world, then it doesn’t matter if it disappears. I believe that we all have potential, but it also takes a lot of courage to realize it. You can float through a life created by circumstances, missing day after day, hour after hour. Or, you can fight for what you believe in and write the great story of your life. I hope you will make the right choice.

Leave a mark in this world. Have a meaningful life, whatever definition it has for you. Go towards it. The place we are leaving is a beautiful playground, where everything is possible. Yet, we are not here forever. Our life is a short spark in this beautiful little planet that flies with incredible speed to the endless darkness of the unknown universe. So, enjoy your time here with passion. Make it interesting. Make it count! Thank you!

So im an 18 y/o guy and like all guys my age im a pretty horny fucker. But here's the story, so about a week ago this girl follows me on instagram, she's followed by some of my friends so im like, ayyo Bidness got a new friend.

Fast forward a week and she dm's me she says some pretty pervy shit, which should have been a red flag but it didn't for some reason. we get to talkin and eventually she convinces me to add her on Skype, so I do and I say hi so she knows its me.

2 weeks go by and she says nothin, then out of the blue she messages me ""heyyyyyyy ;)"" which obviously means she wants Bidness' Dickness. So I tell her hi and she wanted to do a cam session, wasn't sure what to expect but I open Skype and video chat her, she had a smoking hot body and she wanted me to turn my camera on, it was at this point I noticed some odd things, she would say stuff in the chat but not type in the camera, but by the time I realized what happened it was too late.

She had screen recorded the whole thing and said she would post it to facebook sending it to; my mom, my dad, and 3 guys I went to High School with. she said she was messaging it to them so I initially tried to comply with her. she initially wanted $450 usd. but I was eventually able to talk her down to 200.

being the broke man I am I still couldn't cover that so I asked for time, she said no. so I did something I am not proud of but for accuracy I have to include it, I offered to sell out one of my friends if it meant getting time to get the money. she said no, so exhausting all options, I put my 3 HS friends in a GroupMe chat titled, ""I'm being blackmailed"" and informed them not to look at their facebook messages unless they wanted to see my wang.

I texted my mom becuz it was kinda late and I didn't want to deal with her, I emailed my dad because I don't talk to him because hes an alcoholic who fucked us over. my friends have been really lighthearted about it and we've been cracking jokes back n forth for the last 20 minutes.

example: after I filled them in one of them says ""I want to see""

then that started a line of jokes about how they got me from the wrong angle so it looks like I have a 3 inch cock

one said he isn't a shower he shows-her a bad time.

so this just goes to show how you're never safe on the internet, and ill probably edit this later for formatting and grammar so yeah. thats the story of how I got blackmailed.

And the Moral of this story is... don't trust girls who dm you on instagram and are really pervy, never ever sext on Skype.

32,"It has been 3 days ever since my previous entry. I couldn't write one because tablet no battery but all good now.

I've been thinking about the topic of disappointing people because that is likely what I will be dealing with soon. It makes me feel bad disappointing someone. What happened is unfortunate but it is necessary for my development. I'll have to disappoint and deal with it, eventually moving on. This is for the better (of me and my surroundings at least). Maybe I'm exaggerating but it really does affect my mental state. Past 2 days it has been clouding and hovering over my head (2 days ago is when the decision to disappoint was made). 
I really can write and think of just one word-- unlucky.

I'll consult a friend tomorrow about this and see their opinion.

Thoughts don't flow into my mind right now, so my writing will be shallow and not meaty today. Intimacy is the only thing that pops up now, again. How changed of a person would I be had I went through that thing? Would it be for better or worse? Either way, I'm happy with how things turned out, for now. I'll probably regret this in the future but hopefully not. Only time will tell. 

Past friends. So mom tells me 2 days ago on Saturday about how a childhood friend of mine is eager to get in touch with me. What do you mean mate? We have met in first grade and were tight childhood friends til 6th grade where it all collapsed. I just moved a school, was it really hard to contact me back then?  Why did it take you 8 fucking years ? What changed?  Did you realize you aren't as big and important? Did you get bored of your rich social life that you started thinking of me? I will always hold this grudge. I feel betrayed. I can't trust you. I might give you nice smiles and looks but deep down that connection has severed beyond repair. It was rotten at its core. The only way to fix it is by rebuilding it, cleansing the current base or perhaps creating a new one. I have 0 expectations. Though I would love meeting you.  
I want to show you what I achieved. I want to show you how much of a changed human I am. I want to surprise you So bad, you don't even know man. I feel like an alien typing this. Because this whole surprise and show you my achievement thing comes not from a positive place to help you too, rise, but from a negative one-- looking down on you.  This hatred is last remembered when I was around 13-14. Around the time you ditched me. 
I felt so alone, nobody close. School was a battlefield everyday and I was a lone soldier, yet I survived. Fuck you fucking cunt for not being there, ditching me and then having the audacity, through the years, saying several times that you want to meet me yet doing absolutely NOTHING. Fuck you, you are fake. I don't care what happens to you, you can die and I wouldn't even flinch you bastard. This lonely school experience taught me to be independent and self reliant. I do not regret it, hope you do or will. Because I will smash you to bits. When I meet you I'll put the best show I can just to make you feel bad, on what you have missed. Fucking dog.

Reading back on what I wrote above made me rethink of some of my writings but that is the beauty of it. I like seeing raw thoughts translated into written words without any proof reading, rewording. Just as is! 

I feel tad better having my thoughts organised now. I didn't give this childhood friendship topic much thought since 9th grade. Bringing it up again awoke some anger. I will try to approach this as maturely as possible.  I will be working on a reunion this month. I want this to happen-- I want to show you. See you by the end of the month. Or not.",12Mar2019,0

You make yourself find the positive things, even when things are shit. You *create* the positive things. You work hard towards what you want and you go all-in for it. It really is beautiful. I’m beside myself when I talk to you. You know how to be happy. And I understand you’re not perfect. You have your shortcomings and your annoying habits and your terrible grammar. But those pale in comparison to your strong points. I wish I could see you. I desperately hope we do see each other again as we’ve planned. What a terrible disappointment it would be otherwise.

34,"TW Suicide, hospitalization, mental illness 

I had an acquaintance mention to me that they were suicidal. Because we weren’t close, I was dumbfounded that they came to me with this information. I called them on their phone to ensure they were physically safe, after having sent them mental health hotlines. When I got a confirmation that they were hospitalized for their suicide attempt, I blocked them. I was shaking with anxiety the entire time because I couldn’t handle being their lifeline for their suicidal ideation.

39,"So, for this job that I got laid off from had to do with my career. I worked there for 4 months after they gave me the news with out any heads up at first. I couldn't figure out why but I think it had to do with the fact that I was going back to school in August as a part time student. Before I got laid off I just gotten married and my husband and I planned a trip to Florida to go to Disney World. I let my boss know 2 months before the trip that I was going to be gone for a week. As the days were getting closer I prepared everything for my boss and scheduled everything in time AND I would even work overtime that way she won't worry about anything when I""m gone for the week. Mind you going to Florida and staying there for a week while going to Disney World and Universal studios wasn't cheap. The week I came back from the trip I go in work and get called in my bosses office. She basically told me that I had to many good qualities that they can't use and told me to pack my things. I didn't make a big deal because I was shocked about this situation at first. THE WEEK BEFORE I LEFT I BUILT THEM A FUCKING WEBSITE FROM SCRATCH. I put my soul in that website. After I left the office I immediately called my husband and told him the news. The time when we needed money because we spent it in Florida was just not going to happen. I was livid. Came back home crying because I felt defeated. My husband told me not to worry because I have a good resume so I can quickly get a new job so, I started searching. This happened back in August 2018 and now it is March 2019 and I just got a new job. There had been times when I would break because we weren't making enough money. After we would pay bills we barely had any money left to buy groceries or put gas in the car. The struggle was real. I even went low to the point were I had to ask my dad for help with money because we weren't making enough. I hate asking my parents for money. I was convinced that I wasn't getting call backs and getting hanged up on (jobs)  because I'm a part time student. Now I feel that things are getting better as I got a new job on my career path again. I am so grateful now. In a way I feel like this happened because I didn't know how struggling felt till I lost my job.

I have decided to try to disconnect myself with the outside world, this starts trouble I understand but hear me out. People in the world are so rude to each other, this site is a community of people who care, one of the first people I meant in college has thought me to be so much in the past months about being here and life in general. There is no judgment on many of the subs on here and everyone wants the best for everyone. Of course, they'll always be a troll. I've grown up in that age when social media tears myself down more than it builds me up and I'm realizing it more and more often lately. I've always wanted the iPhone because it's what social media is better on but I hate it. I titled this post because I had to and because without college I don't think I'd be where I am, with the improvements to my mental health that have come with this all. I'm blessed for my parents to be able to provide for me, I need to do better with what they give me for help. Next phone I get it's not going to be an iPhone because I want to also start a new life with my social life. I'm not the point where I don't know if I'll reread this because it's longer than I thought. Also meaning I don't know if you understand the post as much as I do. Am I even using this sub right? This is the start of my life, a happier life when my worries seem to not exist, where the things I enjoy are put into my spotlight. I am over the things I always put into competition with myself. I have never wanted an iPhone but my friends had it and it was cool. At that age I knew I didn't want it, I didn't stick up for what was right as a child, as most people don't. I suppose I sound like a brat. It's nearing also 3:00 am, who knows if I will go to bed. My favorite book is The Catcher in the Rye and I think you can see where I'm going with this. I've proud to be here at this point in my life, I feel like I can breathe and live a little better, I just have to go out and do it. For a while, it's been hard realizing that not everyone is going to be with you forever. It's just a cycle of life, I'm tired and want to go to bed, whoever reads this should listen to slenderbodies they make amazing music. I'd be nice if y'all could also ask me questions, send your music suggestions, subs that are generally universally awesome.

For example, there's a youtuber I kind of like but started to drift away from his content. Part of it was I didn't like how much he would complain about things, I found a lot of what he had to say as negative, and his content was becoming less comedic. Despite all these valid reasons, I doubted those opinions and kind of pushed them aside, because I didn't really see other people with those same opinions. I just recently started watching him again, and noticed that a lot of other people are now saying the things I was thinking.

As soon as I saw this, it was like something in my brain clicked. Now I was allowed to have this opinion, and I now knew that my opinion wasn't built off of irrationality and negativity.

I don't want to have to turn to other people to stick to an opinion, though. Having my own thoughts and opinions entirely independent of others is something I find difficulty in. I do have some pretty strong opinions, but those are on things that are less subjective and based off of my own research and experience.

Your intuition is a powerful tool.  And he could be a great guy—just not what some part of you is looking for.  And you can’t in all fairness continue the farce.

There IS someone out there who is going to match your intelligence, make you laugh til you cry (pee a little if you’re REALLY lucky),  who will take all your small mannerisms and cherish them, who will take care of your mental, emotional and physical needs.  And you WON’T wonder if he’s the one.

Genuine, deep, abiding love —that’s the goal, right? Your partner must be primarily your friend.  Not just your friend—in the words of Meredith Gray—they must be “your person.” You have to want to be around them, to tell them everything from the girl at work you daydream about punching and the crazy fantasy you have only barely admitted to yourself.

That said—even the One is going to irk your nerves sometimes.  He is human, and you are human.  But your MAIN emotion when you think of him needs to be things like “home” “safe” “acceptance” “funny” “companion” “sexy”

If you don’t think this person is bringing everything you want, there’s literally billions of others.

I don’t know where I've read it, but it's stuck in my head. The author said, I think she was a woman, that our misery is largely traced back to us having once been children. I don’t recall reading the whole thing, but she also mentioned something about kids understanding that there are two worlds; the adults' and the children's, and they were quite content with theirs as the adults' imagination (or lack thereof) don’t usually determine its content and its rules.

I feel as we grow older, we come to realize that life is but a game, with no serious consequences: a series of absurd events that lead to our demise. A game which we can't help ourselves but to take seriously. However, much to our dismay, we are no longer children; we’ve lost the ability to play, and the game becomes impossible to play without automation and self-loss.

I don’t recollect much of my childhood nor do I dwell in it, but there is an undeniable leftover views of the world that surface every now and then. They’re like flashes that sort of tell that I may have lost the way, that, this is not what I should wake up to every morning. 

I know there are these beautiful moments we sometimes get lucky to enjoy like, the return of spring, the sun sinking beyond the horizon. They evoke into us unfathomable emotions like serenities proceeding the eruption of dormant volcanos. 

I get confused very often, especially about what growing up entails. I’m usually content with that, I learned to dance with uncertainty. But sometimes, given the state of current affairs, I doubt that childhood even happened. It’s as if we were robotically made into adulthood; an un-simplifiable complexity. 

It has to be even worst with unhappy childhoods. 

I meet people with, I don’t know how to phrase it better, but I meet people with dead children inside them. No longer interested in playing with the most playable thing ever; life. 

Although childhood has been/is a true source of discontent with how things are now, its resurrection has become the holy grail keeping me going everyday in this hard life. I see signs of it, I keep gazing at the night sky hoping it would tell me something I know I have forgotten about it.

there, trapped in my own feelings that torture me, and I lose just my whole motivation to live or do anything at all...  I'm lacking everything then - all the power I usually

have. It just gets lost and leaves me emotionally crippled and what feels like innerly hollow... That's when I end up at home being sad and wasting my time on whatever it

will be... video games? memes? Just to cope. In a way, I guess that could even be compared to taking drugs or drinking to cope with problems...

When I'm really down like this, I lack the willpower to do anything, even move... I just sit there, thinking, overthinking and slightly wanting to end it all.

the emotions I have and make them feel special, give them everything good I have or can offer and put all my effort and power of love and soul into our relationship and maybe

just once be finally truly happy, glad and satisfied in my life, I am disappointed by fate again.

I tried explaining to her that I was told I didn’t have any more shifts and was to wait till the next schedule was to be put the new schedule out (which was to be next Tuesday) but she wouldn’t listen. Because I’m brand new and she blames both of us due to miscommunication, I might be suspended from work for two weeks. But I need the money to pay for my car insurance, and am just at a complete loss and feel like I hit a brick wall.

I tried telling my mother right after I got the call, and all she could do was yell at me and say how this all my fault, and I need to either get on my knees and beg that I get another shift soon, or start searching for another job, and if I don’t pay by the end of the month, I will have to transfer to a closer school, and all of my stuff will me taken away, my phone, computer, anything that’s fun, it’s gone.

I needed to put this out cause since my mom didn’t really comfort me, I just feel like I’m at a loss and have no idea what to do but to just wait.",12Mar2019,8

81,"(This is a long ass rant of a post, and while I did put a TL;DR, it doesn’t really come close to capturing how complex all this shit is)

I probably would call bullshit if I heard myself claim I was (am?) in love with someone I never even dated. It just sounds kinda like some rom-commy bullshit, but they always say when it happens to you, you know it’s happened. For me it wasn’t like I seen this girl and there was some firework going off in my head and I knew right there and then I wanted to be with her. It was really gradual, it snuck up on me. We’d work together, we’d joke around more and more, we became really close friends over time. I’m talking over like a year and a half, we’d slowly get closer and closer, find excuses to hang out outside of work, message each other all day everyday, etc. I’d find out these little details about her that would have bored me about other people but when it’s her it’s just the most interesting shit in the world. Anything that happened in my day, no matter how mundane, I’d instantly want to share with her (and still always do, it’s like an instinct at this point).

Eventually I realised holy shit, I am in way too deep here. It seemed, again, like stupid movie bullshit. It was the classic tropey romance storyline; here i was, best friends with a girl who I am inseparable with, while I have all these feelings for her and she has a boyfriend. The thing is, it’s nothing like it gets romanticised to be. Instead of her falling into my arms and realising I was the guy for her all this time, I sat and agonised for months on end on what to do, spending basically every day hanging out with her while being completely head over heels. I tried to just keep it cool and be friends, cause she really is the person I’ve opened up to most in my life and I don’t know what the fuck I’d do without her. But it got way too much for me, I just couldn’t be around her everyday and wonder whether it could ever be more forever. I’d find myself reading into every single thing she said as if it was some kind of sign she likes me back. While to this day, even in hindsight I still think there is something beyond friendship there, it was getting to the stage where I couldn’t have a normal conversation without reading some subtext into it all that just wasn’t intended.

So I told her, almost exactly a year ago. She stayed with her boyfriend, we decided it was best if we both cut each other off as much as it made us feel like complete and utter shit, and I thought that was that.  For a solid month after I was barely functioning; I had exams that I failed miserably, I couldn’t stop thinking about how bad I’d fucked up, and from little things I heard I knew she was really upset about us not speaking anymore too, which made me feel like even more of an asshole for fucking up what was the best friendship either of us had at the time.

Eventually one day she hit me up and told me she needs me in her life, that she’s sorry for how things went and that her and her boyfriend were breaking up. I had spent 3 months slowly getting over her by this point, had just got to not thinking about her every second of the day, and here she was coming back into my life. I wanted to tell her I needed more time to get over it all, but when someone who means that much to you tells you they need you in their life it’s hard to say no. Plus, there was obviously a part of me wondering if she’d reached back out cause she was newly single and wanted to see where things might go between us.

I didn’t have to wonder long, cause her and her boyfriend got back the next day. I felt like a fucking idiot for getting my hopes up, and for the next month or so we were messaging each other, but only like once every few days, and it was really stilted and awkward. I think she reached out to me when she was in a shitty place and we both realised soon after it was a bit too soon. But I just stayed civil with her, and slowly but surely we got back to kind of being normal.

A year on we are now insanely close again, but the whole fact that I feel that way towards her is like a massive elephant in the room that we’ve never mentioned again. We’re close again, but we’re not quite THAT close like we were before I told her, cause I think we both realise that it wouldn’t be a smart move. It sounds like it from this post, but I’ve not spent the full year moping around about her. I’ve really tried hard in college to make up for my shitty grades, which has gone really well. I’ve downloaded Tinder which has been a bit of a confidence boost, been reading a whole lot more, went to counselling at college which was a big step for me (I’ve always been kinda depressed and it was something I’d have to deal with sooner or later), and there’s even a different girl right now that is actually into me and I could potentially end up dating.

But no matter how much shit I fill up my time with, I just can’t get rid of how I feel about her. Most of our talking is through snapchat now (I think it’s kind of went unsaid between us, but I’m sure this is because we both m realise that us hanging out together every second of the day like we used to is just gonna lead to trouble), which makes it easier to kinda put her to the back of my mind a little, but maybe once every few weeks we’ll find an excuse to hang out. And literally every time I find myself back to square one. Just being around her stirs it all back up again. Just every little fucking thing about her still gets to me even after I’ve spent so long trying to get over her. I can kind of forget about it until I see her, and as soon as I’m with her all bets are off. There’s just so many little moments between us that seem too significant to write off. Like I’ll always catch her smiling and giggling to herself, and ask her what the hell shes smiling about, and she’ll be like ‘aww nothing’, all shy and shit. Kind of exactly like [this clip from The Office,](https://youtu.be/Y9XSb0KODzw?t=05m06s) which is weird I suppose since this whole situation does sound like an unhappy Jim and Pam story. It’s like I get given a little glimpse of how things could be between us when we hang out, one tiny little glimpse, and it ends up being all I can think about.

I tell people I’m over it, but I’m not really. Thinking about her doesn’t dominate my every waking moment anymore, but she’s still a big part of my life. She’s probably the first girl I’ve been in love with, and I honestly just don’t think I’ll ever be fully over her. Every time I try date someone else I compare them to her. I could probably date this other girl I know if I wanted to, but I just feel like it would be unfair to date someone else knowing you’re still hung up like this. I can go weeks without seeing her, and as soon as I do I’m right back to square one. She almost split up with her boyfriend (again) a few weeks back, and I found myself feeling terrible for her while selfishly wondering if this might open up the way for something between us (and there were definitely some really flirty messages between us in that little space of time, hell she basically ‘joked’ about sending me nudes, but I didn’t want to take advantage of her being vulnerable), but in the end a year on I’m still in the same position. I’m probably still in love with my best friend, and while I’ve tried and tried to forget about her and move on and use it all as a learning experience, the fact is I don’t know if I’m ever gonna be fully over her. It feels like the best I can do is just keep her at arm’s length like we kinda do the now, but it’s like some kind of addiction; I know as soon as I’m around her even for like a few minutes I’ll be right back to where I started. I don’t know if I’ll ever quite shake that.

**TL;DR:** Slowly became best friends with a girl over a year and a half. First time I’ve fell for someone like that. Told her how I feel even though she has a boyfriend. Cut contact for a while, but a few months after she told me she needed me in her life. Now, while I try entertain the idea of dating other people and try focus on other things, every time we hang out I go right back to square one. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to be fully over her, it feels like the most I can do is limit it.

I am constantly in a state of being in work-mode and last night somebody I really admire, for lack of a better word, said I'm bad at not being in work-mode. The words used have made me self-conscious and insecure about where I am in life, lonely, angry, and sad.  I, however, do what I need to do to survive and try to make my odds of a better life that much greater...  


... but, I'm starting to buckle. I'm struggling in my classes, which has me stressed about my scholarship.

I also have always struggled with biology itself, but I have never felt more passion than what I have for aquatics!

96,"**(I attempted to post in TIFU, but they said it violated the rule about kids in obscene situations. I don’t see it, but, that’s ok I have this sub.)**

I babysit for a family occasionally when their regular sitter is busy. 

Kids are 2, 5, and 7.

The mom and dad had their sitter cancel last minute and they call and I’m free so head over. 

I warned them I could handle bedtime and all but needed to study for a test and asked if they still wanted me to come under the circumstances. They said it was no problem, and to just throw on a movie for the kids until bedtime. 

When I got there it was already the littlest ones bedtime so the parents left and I took the kids to watch a movie. The littlest one was already half asleep and I wanted to capitalize on that and get him in bed so just quick skimmed the movies in their “recommended for you” section, because they were all clearly kids movies with cartoons and all. I’m looking at the titles and I’m like “Do you want one about trains, one about bears, one about Peter Pan—“ they cut me off enthusiastically requesting Peter Pan. I thought it was a low budget sequel because the cover just had the title of the movie, no actors or drawings or anything. But whatever, it didn’t prompt me to pay money so, I figured the kids had already seen it.

I flip it on and take the little kid to bed. A car alarm went off waking him back up, so we spent over an hour going down. After about 30-35 minutes I called downstairs and said “Everything good?” And there was a nice aerial shot of a beach on the screen and an airy instrumental, nothing out of the ordinary for a kids movie. They said they were fine so I went back to tending to the baby. Over an hour passes and the toddler is mostly asleep when I go to check on them and see they’ve turned the TV off and were playing with toys. I asked how the movie was and 8yo says it got boring so they switched it off. 

We put the toys away, start bedtime routine,  and the older one keeps calling everything “anus” and I figure he heard it at school, like kids do. He clearly had no idea what it meant, so I grouped it in with the same phenomena as when he called everyone Mr. Butt Crack for a week. 

They go to bed, they fall asleep, parents come home I collect my money and leave. 

I studied until 4am for my 1pm test the next day so slept in. I woke up to 18 missed calls and 6 unread texts from the family. I panicked thinking maybe something happened to one of the kids like they got sick or something and the parents wanted to know if anything seemed off while I was there. 

I don’t even look at her texts at first, I just call, and she says “You’re lucky. I was just about to call the police.” I have no idea what she’s talking about and my heart sinks thinking something happened to the baby (SIDS was my first thought.) 

I say, you know, are the kids ok? And she says “OF COURSE NOT. HOW DARE YOU SHOW MY CHILDREN PORNOGRAPHY?!??!!???!! IS THIS YOUR IDEA OF A SICK *JOKE*??!” And I’m thinking “What the fuck?” I tell her that absolutely did not happen and ask why she would ever think I’d do something like that. She says “Stop lying. The kids have been asking all morning about why someone would want to suck on someone else’s genitals. I THOUGHT YOU HAD PIMPED THEM OR MOLESTED THEM AND ALMOST CAME TO YOUR HOUSE AND MURDERED YOU.” And I say I have no idea where they would’ve heard about oral sex and she says “THEY TOLD ME YOU SHOWED THEM VIDEOS WHERE THEY LEARNED ABOUT IT.”

And I’m so flummoxed at this point. Because I have no idea where that could’ve come from. I tell her again I have no idea what happened and would be happy to come discuss it further with her. She’s continuing to scream at me when I hear the husband call to her “Hey you better come check this out.” And there’s a brief silence and then the mom says “What movie did they watch?” And I said “A Peter Pan sequel.” And there’s a lonnnngggg silence, she takes a deep breath in and out, and says **”Leaving Neverland is not about Peter Pan.**” 

For those unfamiliar, like I was, Leaving Neverland is the graphic recounting of Michael Jackson’s sexual abuse of children (doesn’t actually show any sex acts, thank God, but still deeply disturbing for adults let alone children). I didn’t read the description in my haste to get the half asleep baby upstairs, and I accidentally traumatized two young children forever. 

The mom chewed me out some more about not screening their movies better and I apologized again and again and again and offered to give them their money back but she refused and chewed me out some more and hung up. I don’t think I’ll be called to work for them again.

97,"I'm 23. I grew up in a Christian home all my life My mother died when I was 12 (parents were already divorced) and that's when I was pulled out of public school and put into a private Fundamentalist Christian school. I was a huge theology nerd ever since; I can tell you exactly what the apologetic is for any criticism of my distinct sect is and I still argue with myself about my falling away and I'm pretty damned terrified of dying because I'm afraid of going to hell (of which apostasy incurs greater wrath). My dad was always a helicopter parent and I was pretty much an angel child because I always obeyed, which I really regret.

The good is that I just moved out of my dad's household 3 months ago and bought a condo with my mother's life insurance which was sitting in a bank account for all these years. I also started my first decent paying career job 2 months ago but...  


I feel like I'm completely unprepared for life. I've never been all that social even within my church. I have an unhealthy amount of social anxiety around groups and the only way I know how to form relationships is when I'm literally forced to be around them in the form of school or work for an extended period of time. I'm an absolute social retard when I'm around people that I don't know. I'm not really sure why, but I just feel intimidated and I'm afraid that I'll embarrass myself by saying some cringy shit and that everyone else knows who they are while I'm just this boring blob of human - so if I'm forced to be in public social situations I mostly just stand there quietly, smirking.  


I guess I'm just really bitter. I feel like I wasn't allowed to have a childhood. I'm angry that I'm still a virgin. I'm most angry that I was never allowed to make my own mistakes, as funny as that sounds. I'm pretty much a 23-year-old who is just now in his angsty teenager stage.  


I want to do something with my life but I feel like I don't have any tools and I'll eventually still have to deal with the fallout of being found out to be a godless heathen.

The girl that did this to her is sort of a big deal, a high ranked girls baksetball player in our state.

Because I (16M) was pissed somebody did that crap to my sister I went on a local preps sports message board that discusses high school sports for our area and I basically talked mad shit about the other girl. Nothing personal or anything, I just said she's overhyped, can't shoot threes, undersized for her position at the D1 college level, a dirty player to overcompenstate. Again nothing personal, just talked shit about her basketball abilities. It was petty and I feel petty writing it out but I did it.

I told my friends one of whom went on there and stupidly said I was my sister's brother from our school and that's why I wrote that crap. So she knows who I am.

Well, for about a month now I've been getting a ton of messages from the other girl, both on Facebook and this message board private messages. She calls me a ""hater"" and asks why I'm talking all this shit about her when I don't know her or don't even play basketball. She says shit like ""wow your life must be so sad.""

I haven't replied to any of her messages (because I'm embarrassed) but she sends them like... every other day. For real.  She's like crazy or something, I've really gotten into her head and she can't let it go that somebody doesn't like her. I mean she's really pretty and athletic and I assume popular at her school but she can't let it go that a rival player's little brother said she's overrated? It's just really weird and I have told a few friends but nobody else and not my sister.",12Mar2019,14
108,"Today I (20m) ate dinner at my aunts house. My dad (52m) was sitting beside me. I had my foot on the table foot. (The table stands on one middle beam and has 4 wooden support feet at the bottom hopefully that makes sense.)

He put his foot on top of mine and started pressing quite hard and digging his toes into the top of my foot. I kicked his foot off, yelled “ouch” and it kinda made the table shake. My aunt asks what happened. I said “he pressed his foot really hard on mine.” and then my dad goes “see, he just kicked my foot, see how my kids treat me?”.

I’m disturbed, is this sociopathic behaviour?",12Mar2019,2
109,"And totally shitting bricks and can’t sleep. 

He is 5 months old on Thursday and bar 3 days we’ve spent every day at hospital since he was born. 

He has Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome and has had his first op but his lungs are also not right and he has always had a way too high internal pressure. So tomorrow is another trip to the cath lab for cardiac catheter to re-stent, re-balloon and to measure the pressures in the lungs. If they’re low then we can press on for his next (2 of 3) surgery. If they’re borderline, the surgeon has said he would do what’s called a Sano shunt potentially buying him some time. If the pressures haven’t come down then we are staring down the barrel of comfort care, which probably won’t be more than a few months best case. 

His pressures need to have more than halved. Doctors have said they’ve not often seen pressures come down by that much in this time. 

I can’t stop feeling like tomorrow we are going to my son’s death sentencing, and he’s barely known life outside of the hospital. 

It’s fucking shit.  ",12Mar2019,62
110,"For as long as I remember I have been quite paranoid. Right now it’s up to the point where I can’t sleep if I haven’t checked just before bed if I turned the gas of, I can’t sleep if I’m not 1000% sure the front door is locked, I can’t sleep if I hear any sound in my house (which is difficult with neighbors and thin walls). Just tonight I checked the gas before going to bed and when I was in bed I heard a sound like a door opening. I have roommates so that’s what it was, i knew that was it but I had to go downstairs and check every empty room anyway. These are all examples of being afraid of dying. I remember being scared of dying when I was very young too. I can’t remember when it started. I don’t want to live my life scared like this anymore but at the same time I don’t want to lose this control. How can I be less paranoid? ",12Mar2019,3
