0,"This is the third time in a row that this has happened. I meet a cute girl on a dating site, we meet up for a first date and hit it off, and we go on a couple more dates and things even start to get physical. The last date goes well, and we continue texting, she still seems enthusiastic, and then a few days later I get hit with the ""I don't think this is gonna work out"" text.

WTF is wrong with me???

I've never been particularly great with women, but a few years ago I started putting in some serious effort to improve myself and get better at interacting with them. I initially didn't get very good results, but each time, even if things didn't go well, I was able to figure out something I did wrong and make sure I did better the next time. Improve myself every time. And I did improve myself, I got a little bit better each time.

What's fucking me up now is that the last two times, I feel like I've done everything right. I can't think of any major things that I would've done differently. AND YET IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH. Some people somehow manage to just get into relationships with no effort. What am I doing wrong??? It's happened three times now, clearly I'm doing something wrong, and yet I can't think of a single major thing I would've done differently.",26Jul2019,2
1,"Hi everyone!! First reddit post here; kinda bummed it has to be about this though

For anyone who has been in or is in a Long distance relationship; how do you deal with trust issues?

This is the first time I’ve fallen in love again with someone ever since my physically and mentally abusive ex boyfriend who cheated on me (who also recently passed away), so it kinda brought up a lot of bad memories that I was repressing in the back of my mind.
 I know trust is a huge part in LDRs and that’s why I’m seeking advice on how to help myself throughout this:  I’m tired of constantly feeding myself negative thoughts and needing to reassured cause I just feel as if I’m a burden because of it (even though he repeatedly tells me I’m not).

Any advice? Please?",26Jul2019,1
2,"I moved to a new place to study. I had to wait a year because I missed the deadline for enrolling to college. I didn't know anyone, left all my family behind. It gets really lonely, it actually made me depressed. I can't tell you how many times I contemplated giving up and going back home. I got some jobs but they were solo jobs and I didn't get to see people much. The only thing that made me bear it was a discord server. I initially joined to. Talk about stuff I liked, like games or anime but then I met some amazing people and they helped me a lot. Those lonely nights seemed a lot more bearable. Online friends might not be close to you in distance, but they sure can be closer to you than the ones around you. I only have one month left till I go to university and I can't express my gratitude for those people. You helped me through a rough patch. You guys are da real MVP's!",26Jul2019,1

4,"There's this big fluffy Persian that lives in my mom's neighborhood that seems to only visit me during big transitional points  in my life. The cat is grey and it's very old, but when it visits me it's the sweetest thing. It rubs up against my leg and demands pets, and I'll occasionally invite it inside my mom's house and feed it. The cat visited me the day of my high school graduation, the week before I moved into my college dorm, the day that I signed the lease to move into my first apartment, and it visited me again today. I'm set to move back in with my mom for a little while due to issues finding a new place, and I've been really stressed about it, but I went over there to move some stuff, and the cat was in the driveway waiting. I feel like this cat is a sign of good luck, like a way for the universe to tell me that it's all gonna be okay. I know this sounds like some crazy zodiac-sign-tarot-card bullshit, but I just think it's interesting that this cat has shown up to hang out every time I hit a new chapter in my life",26Jul2019,27
6,"I've got my fair share of traumatic, sad, painful, and depressing events in my life. Sometimes when I'm down or when one of them is brought up in conversation I often have it met with dismissal and competition. Like if I've recently went through a breakup and am a mess they'll say ""yeah that sucks, at least you didn't have ABC-PROBLEM happen"". Like can people please just have some sympathy? In the last two years I've lost two dogs in traumatic instances and went through my first breakup after a year and a half with the most amazing girl I've ever met. But when I talk about it or it's brought up people dismiss them. It's always like y problems don't matter because others have had worse. *(the next few paragraphs are tangents to explain my pain stories, skip to the last for the conclusion)*

**TWO YEARS AGO:** The dog I've had for a long time and my best bud in the world including human friends got ran over by a garbage truck. We don't have a fence so we have a long leash and tie him to the tree in our yard or something else. We were playing outside and the leash wasn't on the tree and I tied it to the foot of the (heavy wooden) lawn chair I was sitting on. I got up to grab my phone and when a truck came by and he bolted for it (he was kind of a spaz that way) and it slipped off the chair--it's technically my fault for not thinking--and he ran into the road and along next to the truck with the leash trailing behind him. I ran faster than I've ever ran in my life and was literally a foot or two away from reaching it when he went under the wheel. He's a terrier so needless to say I was met with a somewhat flattened spassming dog. I got my mom and we (my little brother included) rushed him to the vet, about 5 minutes down the road, but he was basically dead by the time we took off. Fuck. Btw, that was the summer between junior and senior year of highschool.

**LAST SPRING:** That senior year I fell in love and did the whole naive  ""we're gonna be together forever"" and whatnot. But her and her family was christian and I was an atheist. I had no problem with it and neither did she, but her family is from Texas...need I say more? I'll continue anyway. Her mother (craziest woman I've ever met in my life) broke us up once and basically hated us the whole time. But after the backlash by my then-gf she told her ""I'll allow it but I won't support it"". Then we spent a whole summer and the first half of my first college year trying to get her family to like me. She also had lost all of her friends right before the school year so I was her only positive in her life. Then she got some friends and started getting upset at me occasionally and pushing me away and she's come at me with everything wrong with me that wasn't her opinions but her mom's. I think her mom and family just got to her. She became really mean and hated things about me she never did. Also when her mom broke us up she said ""I don't wanna have to choose but if she's acting this way I can't choose her and live with myself""...she changed her mind on that by the end. We broke up on Christmas, no joke, and got back together then broke up disastrously and out of nowhere on valentines day, again no joke.

**YESTERDAY:** About 6 months after our dog died, we moved on a bit and got a new one. I was the closest to the old dog so I still wasn't fully over him. I still am not. But we got a replacement (that's how I saw it anyway). He was a young dog and we quickly figured out he must've been abused by his previous owners. If you pulled on him (to get down from a couch or something) or nudged him and he didn't want to move or tried to pick him up he would yelp like you stabbed him. It was weird. He was also very shy and often hid under things or in his bed (which we put in the laundry room as his safe space). He was super gentle and calm and would've made a great therapy dog for kids or old people due to how calm and trained he was. He loved belly rubs too. Anyway it was slow but he gradually grew on everyone, me the slowest since I was in college and only saw him every few weekends apart from the summers and winter. He grew on me and I love him too, though to be honest not as strongly as the last one it seems given what happens next. Yesterday I'm at work and my mom comes in, red-eyed, and gets me. Something's wrong. Given the deja-vu of the situation as we walk to the car I just say ""Darwin?"" and she nods. He was running around with my brother having fun (he rarely does this but apparently it's the happiest and most excited he's ever seen the poor dog. As he was running be somewhat hip-checked the wall and yelped, though not hard or anything, then ran to his bed (which was moved into the living room at the moment and did the little dog-spin before sitting down. Then he got up, took a few steps, then tipped over and seized. He shit and peed everywhere, a sight I'm glad I didn't witness and saddened beyond sad that by family had to see. My dad tried CPR but slowly lost him as they made their way to the vet. Fucking freak accident. Out of nowhere, he was young and always seemed healthy. No car or diseases or injuries, just having fun they fuck-I'm-dead. Also a weird thing is it's not as painful as the last one, and since he hid in his room a lot it's as if he's not really gone, or maybe it hasn't hit me yet? Idk but I've cried occasionally but I'm not a mess like the other two things. Also my little brother witnessed both of those dogs AND a previous one first hand, he's gonna be scarred for life and that makes me so sad. I wish I could take his pain for myself, since I'm apparently used to suppressing is by now.

All of this shit always happens to me and my family. We've had two dogs before these and one was cancer and the other also a car (scared of a firework and ran into the freeway a few houses down). And I've lost all of my friends in disastrous ways once in middle school and once in early highschool. Plus other lesser things but those are my main pains. But nobody fucking cares, my problems aren't as bad as other people's so I shouldn't say I'm sad because I haven't blah blah or seen blah blah like they have. My family is the only people I can talk to about this as I'm not close enough to any friends and my gf who I *was* close enough with is not one of those pains. I can talk to my family but sometimes you need to talk to someone who isn't also hurting with you. And sometimes it's brought up at work, school, or with friends or whatever.

Anyway, that's my stuff. Mostly wrote this to clear my mind and release a frustration that my friend/coworker was giving me today (and most other days, she's had a somewhat rough breakup recently as well). Anyway if you have any thoughts on this, not just about me specifically but if you relate to other people dismissing your problems because they're lesser, feel free to comment.",26Jul2019,3

(I know this is an incredibly immature thing to do and I resent all the times it’s happened to me, but I just can’t imagine him really caring that much because he isn’t as nearly attached to me as I am to him.) I want to do this BECAUSE I’m so attached and I feel stupid for letting myself fall so hard, and I know that I’m just going to end up getting hurt like I do every time so why not just back out now... I want to protect myself

But the problem is I know that’s going to leave me vulnerable.. and I currently have my ex boyfriend pining over me trying to win me back. I’m the one who broke off that relationship because it was emotionally and borderline-physically abusive relationship. I know he feels a lot of remorse for everything and he’s just been in a bad place mentally, and I can acknowledge that, but I KNOW I can’t go back because of everything he did to me. However I know I’ll be feeling lonely and heartbroken if I break it off with the guy I currently really like, so I’m scared I’m going to have a moment of weakness and give into my ex again..

Can someone please just tell me I’ll feel better I’m so upset right now.



I mutually ended a relationship today and we agreed to spend this last day together.

We went to a restaurant a bit far from home and I drove and paid for his lunch. He asked me to plan the day out. I only planned going to the restaurant because I was sure that maybe the area we were going to would have stuff to do.

It didn’t.

He got really annoyed with me and he told me to take him home. I kept asking him where he wanted to go. I’d drive him etc. and he shut me down or he didn’t say anything.

The whole car ride was in silence. I kept apologizing saying that I was sorry for not listening to him and for wasting his time. Obviously he didn’t really talk much and said “it’s fine” while complaining to his friends on Snapchat lmao.

Literally trash talking me.

I brought him to his car and asked him if there’s anything I could do to make it up to him and he said he was done and wanted to go home.

I told him to take care since this was the last day and I made a promise to myself that I wouldn’t talk to him anymore. And he just said “ok”

I’ve been crying. This is the first time he acted this way to me. And I guess the last time since he won’t be seeing me again.

18,"My thoughts on happiness and how to live a meaningful and fulfilling life very is simple – we only have to maintain an honest and loving heart, with kind and sincere intentions. This is because real happiness comes from being a kind person. On the other hand, unhappy people generally have a heart of anger, jealousy, and selfishness, and it is because of such traits that they experience much anxiety and suffering, internally in their mind as well externally in their environments and from the people around.

As human beings, we are all different, and our unique characteristics make us special, but we also have many similarities that connect us and brings us close to one another. Not only do we share the same green earth, but we all strive to be happy, to feel loved, and to live a comfortable life while wanting to avoid pain and suffering at all times.

&amp;#x200B;

**A Kind Person**

Kind people enjoy a happy, loving and stable mind because kindness has the properties of patience, empathy, generosity and compassion, qualities that soften and relaxes the mind which leads to peace and joy internally. Externally, they also benefit from having positive relationships with family, friends, and colleagues which lead to much happiness and satisfaction. Because of such positive relationships, they experience pleasure at work, at home as well as in social gatherings. On the contrary, unkind people have minds of hatred, self-centeredness, and ill thoughts, which lead to much fear and suffering. Internally, they know no peace and constantly worry, while externally they have unhealthy relationships with others and continuously experience stress and anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

**Three Acts of Goodness**

The good news is that transforming from being an unkind person with an unhealthy mind, into a kind person with a happy mind is very straightforward. We must simply practice doing good deeds, speaking good words and thinking good thoughts, or namely, the Three Acts of Goodness. By doing good deeds we bring others joy, by speaking good words we encourage and inspire them, and by thinking good thoughts, we purify the world.

Of course, this practice is much easier said than done, but we must take it a step at a time. Start with the simple things and work our way up. Then, slowly but surely, we would have turned the practice into a habit, a lifestyle. At that point, we will be doing it all effortlessly, and the world around us will suddenly feel so much more homely and pleasant.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Practice**

The key to the practice is to continually observe the mind and question the intention of our conduct with honesty and sincerity. Are we really trying to help someone or are we actually after self-benefit? Do we really care about the person we are helping or are we just doing it out of obligation? This is important because the intention behind our actions influences the energy perceived by the people around. Not only that, ultimately, the point is to identify our selfishness, greed, hatred and slowly replace it with generosity, patience, and kindness, so that we can live free from mental impurities, and experience unending joy and happiness.

To summarise, only good people experience real happiness, and good people practice the Three Acts of Goodness. They are:

1. Do Good Deeds
2. Speak Good Words
3. Think Good Thoughts

&amp;#x200B;

May we all realize peace and joy in every moment of our lives and shine forth our inner light to touch the lives of all those around.

I only be negative because I love critiquing so I can build off of it. Apparently, people don’t like that about me. I need to fix that. 

I’m not going to tell which grade I’m in or how old I am. All I’m going to say that I’m in high school.

Now let’s talk about what I’ve done when it comes to girls (I’m a male) I’ve driven away multiple opportunities for a great relationship. For example, since I’m not a hug person, I’ve denied many hugs from girls, like “end of the school year hugs”, a “I haven’t seen you in a long time hug”, etc. I’m almost completely oblivious to hints. I’ve been yelled at from a female friend of mine from ignoring signs from both her and her close friend. I had no knowledge of doing this. I’ve also caused break ups because I don’t hang out with them enough/get bored of them. Not bored as in I’m completely bored with their personality and them, but bored is in I need to do something exiting or I’m going to die. I’ve also noticed that I have a huge problem with boredom. 

Now for boys. I’ve messed up relationships because I didn’t want to hang out/accidentally favoring some friends over the others. Not hanging out with friends due to missing/playing with friends from countries/states I’ve moved away from.

I feel really bad for what I did. I wish I knew the entire time, they were good, genuine people.

I love them so much and I wish they didn’t live 1,000 miles away. 

They’re in Colorado, the rest of his family and I are in Illinois. They moved out there to be close to my sister in laws family, but I think he’s always somewhat hated it. Before they ever left, they stated they have a deadline as to when they’d like to be back in Illinois. Cost of living is so much out there, they’re having trouble saving.. I pray to God they can move back soon. 

He’s recently been appointed “godfather” to our niece and it breaks his heart that he’s not here to see her/us more than 1-2 times a year. I sent him a video of our niece, just because I knew he hadn’t seen it yet and it was very cute and funny. I know he was grateful for it, but he said that videos like that make him even more sad that he’s not here. ☹️ they were in town for Easter to meet our niece. Him and I had a very long, drunken talk at 2 am and he told me that when he was asked to be her godfather, it took every ounce of him to not burst out crying.

Throughout all this i cant stop thinking about a million different scenarios where she ends up cheating. I don’t know where this comes from bcuz i trust her completely. So she goes to this party and after a little bit she  gives me an update and says she drank a can and a half of twisted. Immediately my heart starts racing and i feel a deep pain in my chest.

So after a bit she gives me another update and turns out she took a shot of vodka. This of course triggered another attack.

The second time I was driving, I think I was ""triggered"" by a black car on the side of the road, as soon as I saw it, I felt myself disconnect from everything and I felt like I was driving on autopilot, both times I've also felt the air sucked out of my lungs.

so im still young but im gay &lt;kind of bi but not really&gt;

i have one girl who is my friend and shes really sweet so when i say things like ""females treat straight men like trash"" to my friends i dont mean all women its just how we talk.

so i was at a bar with my boyfriend and we got really drunk so we didnt really mean what we where saying, i said something like ""women are trash they all have lower iqs and sexdrives, i bet they dont have a sex drive at all and only want to manipulate straight guys""

the female bar tender over heard us and got angry, she said thats really sexist of you i bet you get laid all the time, i said of course i do my boyfriend is right here, i bet you suck alot of guys too because your a whore.

she said your really sexist for a fag, i said what ever bitch and me and my boyfriend left, i thought about reporting her but didnt want to go through all that, and also because i was being really rude too.

i do think women have a lower sex drive and iq on average but it does not concern me because there low sex drive does not affect me it only effects straight guys.

my boyfriend got mad when me left he was like ""why the hell did you say that to that women im so ashamed to be there with you""

39,"I currently hate these feelings that I have for one of my co-workers.
I've had feeling for her since February and unfortunately they have slowly grown stronger.
I didn't act on them as there were already co-workers dating and everyone giving them shit for it (I personally didn't give two fucks about it since they are grown adults).

I respect her as a co-worker since her growth in knowledge and ability made me proud as one of her mentors.
But I hate being around her since she sounds so sweet and I find her to be extremely cute.
It's to the point on where I am trying to push her on going to a different shift, since there is currently an opening on her ideal shift.
I've even began sitting a bit further away from her to prevent me from looking her way.
I can't look at her for more than a second out of fear that I may accidentally leak my feelings.
I am fairly sure one of my co-workers figured out I might have feelings for her considering he teased me slightly about how I acted around her.
I know I've improved on hiding these emotions since I no longer stutter around her.

As much as I want to tell her my feelings, I know she is dating someone else.
I also know that these emotions are due to an infatuation and not actually love since I barely know anything about her.
So rather than allowing my feelings to take over, I would rather stay as her mentor and co-worker, even a friend.
I hope for her happiness, much like I wish for all my co-workers happiness, even the few I hate.
I just want my feelings for her to disappear so I can continue on with my life and not be distracted by them every five minutes.

41,"Hey y’all this is my first ever post lmao

I just wanted to come here to vent yenno and get some responses n advice

All of my traumatic events happened in the span of 5 years; high school. Mom got cancer, dad got a heart attack &amp; lost job, brother got a drug addiction, close friends betrayed me. I tried to say strong with all these things in the beginning but when things kept piling up that’s when I felt like I was losing myself. My family sees me a strong &amp; talented young woman while to my peers I act quiet, distant, and unbothered. In reality I’m just tryna get through the day, try not to let my anxiety get the best of me, over analyze everything, and blame myself for the littlest things.


2 years ago was the worst time for my mental health as that’s when I seriously felt like something was wrong with me; isolating myself, crying every single day for no particular reason, having suicidal thoughts, and even attempting to commit suicide. Even now I can’t believe that I was like that. I do have to say that although I have made some improvement compared to then, it has greatly affected me. Since I isolated myself for a whole year, I find it difficult for me to socialize and open up to others which limits me from making new relationships with people. I was quiet before but I found it super fun to meet new people and make friends. Now I just feel uncomfortable. I overthink too much, I can be super negative on myself, and even though I know I have talents, I don’t push myself to show people even though I do want people to see what I’ve got in store. 

Basically throughout these past few years, I’ve been having waves of depressive and obsessive thoughts and it’s not like I get better but I kinda push it aside and act like nothing happened WHICH IS SUPER BAD IK

I just sound like a super insecure person, right? Sigh.

OK so... after writing all this I just feel icky like there’s is so much more happening in the world and to others that I have no reason to complain about my life. I am lucky to live the life that I was given. Just gotta get thru these annoying obstacles.

Fuck it.. I just want to hear how people’s lives are going whether positive or negative; brag, self-deprecate, whatever it is! 

Sorry for the messy vent in the beginning, I was having a sadboi vibe moment for a bit lol",26Jul2019,2

   I am an 18 yo male who has worked a summer job with the same boss, who is 39, for the past 5 years. Throughout the years we have gotten close and become very good friends. He knows my mom well and even went on a couple dates with her before. He has been divorced (for about 8 years). Last week he invited me to go with him on a work trip to pick up some stuff at our job site, the drive is about 3 hours. On the way there he begins a conversation about personal stuff and tells me that he has struggled with his sexuality and considers himself on the gay end of the spectrum. This was a large factor in his divorce. 

   He then reveals he knows I have also struggles with my sexuality (thanks Mom!). I tell him I don't really care that he is gay and it doesn't really change anything about our friendship. 5 min later he tells me that he ""has feelings"" for me I was confused and caught if guard. He tried reassuring me that it wasn't a sexual thing and he didn't fantasize about having sex with me. I told him I had zero interest in anything sexual or romantic with him and the rest of the day was extremely awkward. I am still processing this and I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to quit the summer job and end our friendship but I also don't think I can forget or look at him the same ever again.",26Jul2019,1

44,"I think a lot of things in life are really beautiful, events often unfold in a poetic way. I think society devalues beauty, it's often regarded superficial. Especially as a man, it feels like we're supposed to think of things as sexy or extreme rather than beautiful, for fear of coming across as timid, or overly sentimental.

Beauty has a impermanent quality. It's enjoying not only the flash of a firework, but the glimmers as they fade into the night.

I personally think we neglect beauty because we are insecure. Beauty is honest and genuine. With genuinity comes vulnerability. We are afraid to show people who we really are, for fear we will be judged to harshly.

Beauty exists in the imperfections, the asymmetry. We know that we are all imperfect, but worry that we are slightly more imperfect than everyone else.

A peice of advice that I overlooked, or misunderstood for most of my life was ""be yourself"". It's repeated ad nauseam, to the point where all meaning is lost. Maybe a better phrasing is ""live for yourself"", not in a selfish way, but be your own reason for waking up in the morning. Enjoy yourself and others will enjoy you.",26Jul2019,2

On one side of the family, I'm related to neo-nazi gun supporters that love Trump &amp; his ideals. I live in Australia. These people must be one of the biggest groups of neo-nazis in the entire country. And there's so many of them. They're my grandmother's siblings and she had 12 of them, they've all got children and grandchildren, some have great-grandchildren.

Then, on the other side, I'm related to a mass murderer. My cousin killed 50 people in a terrorist attack. I had no idea that it was him until yesterday. I knew he existed, but hadn't connected the dots.

I have no idea why I seemed to escape the crazy, I consider myself relatively normal and definitely are not a neo-nazi nor murderer. It's horrifying to think about.

My friend the other day brought up the idea of creating movie analyses or critiques in order to help me improve my writing and creativity.

62,"Both in our late teens, been together for 6 months and best friends for quite a long time before coming together. Long story short, my family went on vacation and left me home alone for a bunch of days. I naturally invited my girlfriend over. This is the first time she's ever visited my house. One thing you should know, I have some childhood trauma connected to the place. I haven't invited anyone here since early elementary school. My family is poor and my father is mentally ill. The house is basically an ugly mess and I was always scared people will judge me based on it.

However, I didn't worry much because me and my gf had known each other for so long and all that. I figured it's time I face it and let someone in cause it's a part of me after all. I was a little nervous but overall felt fine. The thing is, when she walked in and we talked for a while my eyes got glassy out of no where. I would've never imagined I'd act like this. I guess my mind just started wandering back to childhood and reverted to that state. I've always been dominant and took care of every problem in the relationship so this was very humiliating for me to cry over something like this. 

We'd left and got into a little fight, nothing major at all. All of this happened in the span of a few minutes after leaving. My mind was still on a rollercoaster ride and seeing her cold expression and hearing her cold remarks just pushed me over the edge and I had a full on panic attack out of nowhere. I don't even remember our walk to where we ended up. This is the second panic attack in my life. I very rarely cry if ever at all. I feel like I've lost some aurhority because of this experience and I just feel so humiliated and have no idea how to deal with this. One more thing, she's been supportive throughout the experience, excluding the fight. I'm not ashamed to admit I'm dying to hear some advice

64,"I’m back at the bottom of corporate the ladder again, trying to figure out what to try next. Liquor store cashier at $9/hr.

I hate the bottom, not just for the pay and shitty treatment; more so for how you’re expected to be a blind, silent follower. Follow really stupid rules, don’t point out poor management, etc.

I tried to play along. Be like my coworkers, not care, just be there for the paycheck.

But there’s so many easily fixed issues with the store! It drove crazy!

I started on small things. Paper bags kept falling on top of each other? Cardboard dividers. Easy. The same people buy the same things every day? Pre-bag them. Easy. Etc., etc.

My managers liked these ideas. I decided to go further. The inefficiency of the counter storage space was screaming to be fixed.

Managers were more “ehh” with this bigger change. Kept saying “it will be a lot of work.” Not really? Maybe for your lazy asses, but not most people.

Started thinking, planning, running numbers. Only the most sold items should be stored up here. Which isn’t most of it- have 3 out of 4 of the back stock shelves are pints we almost never sell. There will be a lot of free space. 

“Ah-ha! Moment” came upon me.

We have a drive-thru behind the counter. Most folks get cold beer from it; but we have a few regulars who get the same hard liquor every day/week. Or just really common items from different people. 

Put those under the counter. It would save so much time. Yeah, walking to the back of the store, grabbing a bottle, and walking back only takes 45 seconds. Won’t matter much when the store is slow. But during rushes, when there’s 5+ cars at the drive thru and 10+ people at the counter? That 45 seconds adds up. *Especially* if there’s only one employee there.

Told my manager my idea. “I don’t think [owner] will like that.” 

“Why not?”

“Because it’s your guys’ job to walk through the store. You don’t get to be lazy.”

“It’s not laziness, it’s time-saving. It isn’t hard to walk through the store, it’s time consuming.”

She shrugged and told me to ask the owner whenever he comes in next. Which could be weeks.

I thought about what she said. It’s bullshit. I hate that management philosophy most of all: “don’t do anything to make employees jobs easier, they should suffer as much as possible! My job as a manager is to make my employees suffer as much as possible!” It’s industrial revolution-era bullshit, and needs to fucking die.

Fuck her, fuck the owner, fuck their shitty philosophy. I’m going to improve the store as I see fit- barring they actually have a better reason not to than “it will make the slaves lives easier.”

So. I did it. She has no backbone anyway, it’s why the owner keeps her around. Couldn’t even fire someone, asked me how to do it, then made the owner do it anyway.

She just mumbles at me “I don’t think it’s a good idea...” I reply “I’m not going to work somewhere I have no control. I give a damn about my job.”

I do give a damn. I like that I give a damn. I give a damn no matter where I am or what I’m doing. I’m not rolling over, looking down, or shutting up. I’m innovative, I’m creative, and I’m a problem solving. Those are my strengths and passions, I won’t sacrifice them for $9/hr.

But, to this day, I’m still struggling with people assuming I am a female before meeting me.  I’ll send an email, or receive one, and get replies with “her”, or “she” or whatever, in return.  It’s awkward to correct people and I know they feel some level of embarrassment at the mistake.  I don’t shame them; if anything, I am the one who is embarrassed by it.  In my professional years, I adopted my first name initial, and on emails and correspondence to people, I sign off as “X. Ashley Lastname”.  I’m using X as a placeholder here (first name is not Xavier :D).  Still, the issue persists.  I also reside in the southeast US, and it seems Ashley became a HUGELY popular female name in the time around when I was born, and just after, and to this day.  Before then, Ashley was rare for men and women in these parts, and I was actually given the name because my mom’s favorite movie was Gone With The Wind.  Whole other story there....

So, I’ve not lived over half my life, most likely, with people whom I’ve yet to be introduced to, assuming I’m a female, until we meet in person.  It’s ridiculous, and I know there are a lot bigger problems in this world.  But it’s been a personal frustration.

Okay... well, a long shot but a thrown spear goes straight, exactly the path it should be on. It is strong and useful. 

That’s me. I’m a gary. I’m a strong, bold spear floating through life, exactly on the path I need to be on.

Somehow I always knew she was going to end her life by her own hands. Her father killed himself 2 years ago, and I know that she's struggled with his death ever since it happened. She had told me he was the only one she could trust in her family. She had a complicated family history, with her parents' divorce, and inheritance after her father's suicide. 

I never thought I would be the one posting this, after having seen so many posts on death of a loved one. I've always empathised with them, how much pain they would be in, and I just can'r believe this happened to me.

I miss her so much. I don't know what to do with her photos, with her text messages. I wish I kept all her voice recordings in our chat messages. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do anymore.",26Jul2019,39
71,"First off, wanna apologize if this is not appropriate for this sub. 

I’ve always held pretty well with my self confidence even though I was never that attractive. I heard through a friend of mine that a couple guys through high school had referred to me as ugly and I felt a little bad but it didn’t bother me that much because I barely knew these guys. And then I fell in love with my best friend senior year of high school and he didn’t feel the same way and this was just a very bad toxic time of my life so I went through his messages. He had told his friend that he just didn’t feel that way about me because he wasn’t physically attracted and found me “borderline ugly”. And that was the beginning of the downfall. I went to college a few months after that and I couldn’t even look at guys in the eye because I felt so ugly. Fall semester of 2nd year my confidence was at an all time low because of spending time a lot of time with a toxic friend who talked about men a lotttt and all the different guys she was getting and I felt so bad about myself. But then at this one party I got with this guy who I had had noticed since the beginning of the semester and thought he was very attractive. My appearance started changing a lot in college and I started getting with more and more “attractive” guys and that helped me realize different guys are just attracted to different types. Since January I’ve been casually seeing this guy who’s very very attractive and someone who I definitely would not have been able to be with in high school. I’m sorry if any of this sounds conceited or something. I know it’s bad that I place so much value into whether guys find me attractive or not but that’s just how I always have been and don’t know how to not do that. 

So to the current story, I met a guy(23M) at a frat party a couple months ago and he was an older member of the frat. We talked a bit along with some other friends and all added each other on snap. Haven’t really thought much about it until a couple weeks ago I posted a snap story with my friend who was also at that party  and he replied to my story asking what we were up to and asked us to go out with him and a couple friends that night. My friend wasn’t up to it so we didn’t go. He texted me(I was alone at this point) later that night clearly very drunk and asks me to come over to their frat house and I said I couldn’t. Again today he replies to my story and asks what me and my friend(a different friend) were doing and asks us to come out so we went cuz we weren’t up to anything anyways. I started assuming he was kind of into me and I began kind of being interested in him. I couldn’t get in since I’m not 21 but they met up with us for a bit and then we split up. I was later texting that guy and he says “your friend is hot” and honestly my self esteem just shattered. I was also kinda drunk and replied “she has a boyfriend” and also jokingly said “woowww I’m insulted lmfaooo”. He replied saying “I mean so are you obviously” and then basically was like so I can’t make a move on her?? My friend said a lot of men are just like that and will ask about people’s friends too even if they’re into them. I’ve experienced this on dating apps, too. Idk why this is affecting me so much I can’t stop thinking about it and I feel like all the progress I’ve made over the past year has gone down the drain. I’m just tired of feeling like the ugly friend. Sorry for the long post maybe I just really needed to rant but I was wondering how to stop letting things like this affect me so much.",26Jul2019,1

76,"I come from a large Italian family, and I stumbled across an article from 2004 that detailed the trial of a Sardinian businessman who was accused of ratting out a mob lawyer to the London mafia in 1982.

As I read the article, I recognised one of the names in there as my aunt, turned out she'd been serving as an interpreter for the businessman during his stay in England, completely unaware that he was there to set up a murder. The lawyer was found hanged by his neck underneath a bridge in a staged suicide and my aunt had to serve as a witness. My great grandmother is also quoted in the article.

80,"As a former Special Needs Student of 12-13 maybe 14 years, I'm disappointed with the current state of Special Education Schools, I truly believe high-functioning students like me deserve to be treated like adults and have great education.

We're fully functional, fully aware humans, not animals.

The fact that I witnessed high-functioning students like me being treated in the same way how low-functioning students get treated makes me sick to the stomach. You're supposed to fix us like psychologists do, not dragging us around and treat us like children  

I demand a bit in the current legislation where high-functioning students should not be allowed to attend Special Needs Schools. Special Needs Schools should only be for low-functioning students who are unable to fit into society due to how society is nowadays. 

Just because i'm Autistic with Moderate Learning Difficulties (UK term for Learning Disability). doesn't mean you have the right to treat me like a child. I'm as high functioning as a neurotypical. Teach us advanced topics, not childish topics like Year 1 math, I find it hard to believe that their are people who believe that high-functioning students belongs in the same group as low-functioning students. If I went to a mainstream school, I come out as more intelligent and less broken. 

Seriously, i'm waiting for a Special Needs teacher to come and confront me, and tell him/her how wrong he/she is, I'm waiting for a justification for high-functioning students belongs in the same group as low-functioning students, a justification for treating high-functioning students like children, a justification for teaching primary school level English/Maths/etc to way older high-functioning students and a justification for all the shit Special Needs Schools does to their high-functioning students. I need accurate answers and reasons on why this is happening.

85,"I’ll try to keep this short as possible. There is a controversy in my sons little league and games have been postponed due this. The coach has a brother and my daughter is friends with the brothers daughter. 
This past school year my wife and the brother would coordinate play dates and sleep overs through text and phone conversations. This never bothered me at all. 
During the little league controversy the brother has been conveying inside details that he gets from the coach to my wife. She would then tell me about the details and that they came from the brother.  This also hasn’t bothered me until this morning. 

When she was getting ready she mentioned that other little league games were being played, not my sons team. This was a rather big detail and she never told me it, she got the text from the brother last night.  
This controversy has been ruling our life this week since we need to be able to schedule. I asked why she didn’t tell me about the other game last night, she said “I thought I told you.” Considering what’s been going with little league, any slight detail is a point of conversation. 
It bothered me she didn’t tell me the detail then offered a lame excuse. I was upset thinking about this while lying down in bed, because this didn’t seem to make sense. I went down stairs and asked to see the text message from the brother. She said she had deleted the text message and all other messages from the brother. I asked why? She said because she knew I would get mad.
So that’s where I’m at, I asked why she would delete innocent messages when I know they’ve been corresponding. No real answer other than telling me she’d know I’d get mad. 
Now, I’m starting to freak out over the fact that her deleting the messages is totally suspicious in my opinion. Has anyone had any relatable situation with a SO and deleting text messages from a known acquaintance? We haven’t had a lot of problems with suspicion in our marriage, we’ve had our problems but we are far from a toxic relationship.

91,"I’m using a throwaway for obvious reasons.

I’m a college student, I work as a desktop support technician at the moment, and overall a normal human being with a foreseeable future. 

However what I’ve been experiencing has just been let known to be isn’t normal. And I’m terrified to say the least. 

As to what I experience now, I always hear my parents yelling my name. Even though I haven’t lived with them in about two years, I don’t hear them inside my head, I hear them from what it sounds like in another room or downstairs. 
I also hear music constantly, it’s quiet, and always plays what seems to be inside my ear, I can’t recognize what the lyrics say but I recognize the genre always. Usually it’s always punk music. 
I’ll also always hear cable TV static, I don’t pay for cable, nor do I use my TV a lot. I hear the static and sometimes I hear a voice come thru the static. Again, I can never make sense as to what lyrics or voices say (Besides my name).

Here’s what I’ve done about this in the past (and past experiences):

I used to see shadows a lot as a kid age 10, they were always transparent and dark colored (dark reds, blues, greens). I looked at them and they looked back to me, they were always dressed in what seemed to be 40’s and 50’s attire. 

I eventually told my mother and she took me to a psychic (we both thought I was seeing ghosts), psychic was able to give me a ritual on how to make them go away. I will not say what the ritual is nor explain because I don’t want these visuals ever again. And it legit worked, I remember not seeing them. Besides ones you see in dark rooms or sleep paralysis, but that is considered fairly normal I think. My parents also told me to never ever mention my visuals to others, ever. 

Around the age of 12, I was taken into a mental hospital for a suicide attempt and then diagnosed with severe depression and a panic disorder. I remember the intrusive thoughts I was having and just wanted my mind to be quiet, thus trying to kill myself. I was later diagnosed with severe OCD at age 16 as my intrusive thoughts were more superstitious (if I don’t do this, this terrible thing WILL happen - mentality). My psychiatrist told me my anxiety and depression were rooted from OCD. 

Around the same time I was mentioning the voices I was hearing, however since I commented on sleeping too much, she wanted me tested for narcolepsy (hearing voices when you’re too exhausted). I got my diagnosis and ever since then I’ve regularly been taking Luvox and Modafinil. However, I am not sleepy anymore and my most intrusive thoughts have quieted down. I still hear things. 

I’m 22 now, I live in a weed legal state and work in the tech field. I’ve smoked weed for a while, but I’ve heard of drug psychosis before, and I’m starting to hear my voices louder every time I smoke at the end of the day. Sometimes new ones will come through and I can never tell whether it’s real or not. I’ve stopped smoking a month ago and my voices persist, and I hear them more often. There are no new ones however, only whenever I’m under the influence...which is very rare unless you wanna count my medications, caffeine, and nicotine! 

This is what made me realize the voices and things I saw as a kid may not be ‘normal’. If drug psychosis is making my symptoms worse, how can I be for sure what I experience is normal? 

I called my mom about this recently (I’m close to my parents still), and she says it’s spirits talking to me and not to go to see a doctor because it’s nothing. I just need to pray and do the rituals I was told to do years before. She mentioned to me there is no past psychosis related disorders in either my moms or dad’s family. She tells me it’s nothing serious because, “my nightmares aren’t in the real world, ” and, “If you’re crazy, then we will put you where you belong (long term mental hospital stay).” She also will claim she hears her name being called as well and it’s a normal thing. She used to do this with all my diagnosis (relate to any symptom I had). I wonder if she has something and doesn’t know...

I’m terrified that I have something untreated, I desperately want to try to look for someone. But money is tough, and I can’t see a specialist for an evaluation rn (wage and parents insurance). And I fear that my parents will disown me and make me move back to my hometown if I try to get a diagnosis. 

I want to be here where I reside now, and I don’t want to go through a psychotic break, I want to stop this early if it’s anything. My whole life I thought what I experienced was normal until recently. I’m lost, I feel stuck, I’m not hopeless, just terrified of what may come next. I needed to vent out somewhere. I don’t want my life ruined by this. Because it’s so good now. 

I don’t know what I need rn, I’ll do anything to calm myself down about the situation. Sorry if this whole post is messy. I hope all of you have a good day today and stay well, treat yourself good, and eat some cake. 

TLDR: scared of a psychosis break thru bc of the voices I hear and how long I’ve experienced similar symptoms.",26Jul2019,3

Recently I feel like I'm..... a walking dead. To give you a bit of background, I was a good, hardworking kid in my high school years. I was an A+ student and was steadfast and hardworking, during the second half of my gr 12 year I've become more laidback.. skipping classes and not handing in assignments, things that I've never done before. I felt rebellious. On the last day of high school most of the graduating students felt excited, but at the same time sad that they have to leave it all behind. Meanwhile I was finishing up my overdue English homework.... on the last day. Nevertheless I was still able to attain a high enough grade to get into the Faculty of Engineering.

Once in university I begin to turn back to the old me once again, doing well in the first half of the semester... but then for some reason... I just got tired of university life and said.... fuck it. I was tired most of the day, wandering through the hallways to get to my next class like a soulless skeleton. the same goes for the second semester. At the end of the year I finished with the minimum grade possible to stay in the faculty...and VWed(Voluntary Withdraw) two of my classes, right now I'm taking Calculus 2 one of the class that I VWed.

I've become lazy and started to avoid responsibilities. I now sit in a room all day and just go on youtube mindlessly. I've tried changing but... it just seems like I don't have the energy to change anymore. Even just thinking about changing seems like a huge effort that I'm not willing to undertake.

101,"I live in a city of around 800,000 people and our transit system is obviously designed for a much smaller city. It's considered unreasonable to expect a bus to be on time, in fact a study was conducted and it found that buses here are on average 5 mins or more late 45% of the time. If you live anywhere outside of the core your service suffers dramatically- for example if I work at 12 noon on a Sunday I need to be on the bus before 1020am. The buses dont run much on sundays or holidays and it's a 20 minute drive or a 40 minute bike ride. Never mind taking the bus home if you work until like 10pm. Because the buses stop I have a half hour walk home, which while inconvenient isnt a huge deal (for me) our winters average -25f which makes things much less manageable.

And sometimes (often enough to be a problem) buses just... dont show up and you wait double time. Imagine this happening when it's so cold outside air exposure can cause permanent damage in a short amount of time.

My dad today just asked me for 1800$ out of random and I said no because i lent him 1200$ two months ago and he never paid that back.

I've been picking myself up and I'm glad I did. I'm proud of what I've done, of the help I managed to ask for, but that's not really what I wanna talk about here. 

As I said, I'd like some thoughts about relationships. I just (basically 2 days ago) confessed to a girl (17 y) who I had spent quite a lot of time with recently. 

I like her, a lot. After I confessed to her she was shocked, and told be she isn't in the best mental state at the moment, and I'm glad she told me that.

Now, the day after, we spoke to each other. Basically just of how we kinda liked one another and it was kinda cute ya know.

She said she would like to give it a shot, because experiencing something is a big step for learning...
And now we're a thing I suppose  c:

But as I said, she has gone through some stuff, and I can relate to a bit of it, and I just want to help. I thought I accepted that there isn't always something I can do, and that she has to be the one to fight for her mental health (and I know she will try her best to do that). 

I just worry...a lot. I'm pretty good at that. I guess I need some reassurance or something, I've never been in a relationship before and I'm ready to fight for this to work between us as much as I possibly can, even if it hurts. 

Of course there's always the chance that we aren't right for each other, but still. I want to have a future with her, and my fantasy makes sure to remind me of that...

I just-  is there anything I can do? Or do I just need to be patient and make some good memories with her and just have fun? Because of the things I've experienced I worry a ton, especially since I want her to feel good, to be happy and become stronger, mentally.

109,"Basically the title. I've always had issues with relationships. Meaning, I give so much of myself that I usually loose me and forget to take care of me first.  I always catch it and I usually bounce back, but that usually ends up in me ending that relationship and then spiraling out of control for a bit.

Anyways, I got married in my early 20's and I molded myself into him. My typical style unfortunately. I changed all the things I loved about myself, even changed the things I didn't like, which that part was for the better. Although, we are now going on 3 years of marriage and lately, I have been so down in the dumps. I guess you can say high functioning anxiety/depression kind of thing. I was thinking of me loosing my youth to a man and relationship, I couldn't even remember what I liked to do for fun, what music was my favorite, all I could think of were things my husband likes, not what I like. To the point of questioning myself even, *Do I like this? No, I don't think so, that's what babe likes..wait no that's what I like..* These thoughts were giving me mixed feelings in regard to my relationship, which I DID NOT want to happen. My husband is the best man I have met, and he genuinely wants the best for me, our relationship, and our future. Recently, it dawned on me. I have been living in a shadow and on auto pilot for so long.

I am literally doing ME for the first time in my life and I am slowly getting out of my 'midlife crisis' I like to call it. I'm becoming happier, and feeling more free, I am remembering ME.

110,"Hi guys, not sure if this is the best place to post this. But I was wondering if anyone happened to read about a post where OP said he finally woke up from being auto-pilot and realized that his parents are dead and that he completely looked different? I was reading it and fell asleep and can't seem to find that post anymore. Also not sure if it's a dream that I had but I was sure some comments were suggesting that he had a dissociation of some sort. Any help?",26Jul2019,1
112,"It all started when we were talking on the phone about life in general. After 15 minutes of talking, I was saying some important stuff about my self and mental health and she hang up on me. I wondered why? Maybe lost connection. So I tried calling her back over and over again and she wasn’t picking up the phone. I thought something happened to her, I thought she was unconscious. So I immidiately run to her house to check on her, and what did I see? Her watching YouTube videos on her laptop. She prefers to watch funny videos rather than helping her son with his mental illness. Because I caught her, she confessed to me that she no longer has feelings about me and she only keeps contact to me because we are blood related. I was in shock, literally about to faint. My own mother, the one that we’ve been through SO MUCH just said that to me. I literally couldn’t believe what was happening. 

Now I just run home and I’m clueless to what to do. She is trying to reach me out to apologize and try to confront me, but I don’t want to pick up the phone and talk to her. 

I don’t know what I should do.",26Jul2019,1
114,"It's been going nonstop for days now. I feel severe emotional distress, a persistent urge to cry and overall borderline lethal cortisol levels. I can barely breath painlessly at this point. I have been familiar with depression and loneliness for practically my whole adult life, but this is more visceral than anything mental health-related I have gone through. The only methods I use to distract myself from the pain are games and music; and they prove to be no longer efficient. I patiently await sleep since as early as I wake up; and sedative antipsychotics seem to be me only consolation in this regard. I contemplate death more than I ever have, and reached a conclusion that whatever comes after this life would be more bearable. I don't go out that much; but when I do, I get faced with people's suspicious looks and expression that remind me of how alienated I am from this materialistic world.

I am tired of all of this. I am tired of having to consult a psychiatrist just to be prescribed yet more sedatives or classic antidepressants that numb the senses or relieve the physical symptoms for a while, but do absolutely nothing about my chronic inability to live. I tire of therapists who give me the most basic advice possible and the stigmata I carry whenever I try to open to anyone about my desperation. I just wish to be relieved at this point.",26Jul2019,1

I plan on marking stuff off as I go, so that at the end of the day I can look back and feel accomplished. I'm happy there's a sub where I can post something small like this!",26Jul2019,4

118,"Life has done nothing but give me everything these past few years, but in no way, shape or form am I happy.  When I was younger, I had a million problems.  Life beat me up really bad all the way until I graduated high school, even into the first year of college, but after that I haven't had any problems.  In fact, I couldn't imagine it going any better than it is.  I've got a family that cares the world about me and is very much so together and functional, loving and supportive.  I've got a job that pays me $5k a month as a 22, almost 23, year old who hasn't even graduated college yet (super senior, but doesn't bother me).  That said, the job requires I work 72 hours a week but frankly I wouldn't do much otherwise if I wasn't working so it doesn't matter.  I've got great friends, and lots of them.  I've literally got dozens of people who would more than happily go grab a drink or hang and play some Xbox or whatever we might choose.  I have a girlfriend who is the sweetest, cutest girl in the world who everyone tells me might be the most beautiful girl they've ever met in person (she is gorgeous but they're def exaggerating).  I travel a good bit, not as much as I'd like only a week every couple months or so, and traveling is one of the few things that I find makes me truly happy, but not alone, I need a companion.

All of this said, I am by no means happy.  I usually come home every night vehemently depressed, and have even had suicidal thoughts recently.  I used to suffer from significant mental health issues but I've found great coping mechanisms and been able to control it ever since doing some outpatient therapy at a major facility after my freshman year of college.  I'm usually able to snap out of the suicidal thoughts and severe depression, but, still I'm not happy.  I feel very lost, very out of place.  I can't necessarily afford a therapist right now, nor could I even get out of work long enough to go see one, but I've been through so many years of therapy I'm not so sure there is anything they could help with anyways, I know the tricks and tips.  I'm not seeking any answers or anything like that from this post, it's more so just me finally spilling this all out to someone.  While I do have many good friends as I've said, none of them are particularly good advice givers, some are good listeners but I don't want to bother them with this.  I just needed an outlet.  I certainly welcome any comments and insight, but it's not what I'm seeking.

Sorry for yet another ramble, Reddit, but I greatly appreciate this community every time you let me bother you with my thoughts.",26Jul2019,2
119,"I make greetings cards on Etsy. You can see a [previous post about it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/cf1170/i_make_kinky_greetings_cards_on_etsy_these_are/).

Most of the subreddits that might be applicable to these cards don't allow self promotion. Most subreddits just don't care about businesses being, well, a business.

So, with that in mind, what other services might be good to promote myself? Where might people happen to follow me? I've got all the usual stuff like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter. I've even just signed up for Tumblr. Is there anything big that I'm missing? Anywhere that would be able to type in a tag, for example and find me?",26Jul2019,2
120,"1. People just use eggplants instead which look nothing like dicks
2. It's not like that censors anything as people send *actual pictures of a dick* via text all the time
3. So just make a dick emoji

122,"The Pando tree forest in Utah are made up of clones of a single tree that are all connected underground. One tree controls all other trees, so the entire forest is one entity. That is not only larger than the blue whale, but weighs more than the blue whale.

So the blue whale isn't the largest living thing, is it?",26Jul2019,1
