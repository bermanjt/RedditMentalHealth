Tonight, I'm going to go ahead and dismantle every single theory  about reality, I'll show you how it cannot be defined with words or  beliefs...  If you care about it, go ahead and read.  If you don't, just  ignore it.

Every single human experience starts out the same  way, as a baby.  No baby has ever started out with any type of knowledge  of itself.  They are completely surprised by what's going on, nothing  makes any logical sense.  Despite all of this, they know how to cry, laugh, eat and poop.  What a wonder...

 Fast forward to now...  You've heard ""grown babies"" tell you that  science explains what reality is, religion is the truth and that you are  simply a ""human being"".  Now, let's take a moment to examine what is  going on...  This ""expert"", be it a teacher/parent/guru/scientist/priest  etc., whoever it was, claimed that they know the ""truth"" of ""you"" and  they told you who you were...  Well, let me ask you something, how could  they possibly know?  They started the same way you did!!!  Please, give  me a break.  Their experience began in a position of complete  ignorance...  nothing has changed, they are still ignorant.  Their minds  were vacant of knowledge when they ""started"", but then they began  speaking about reality and defining themselves and the ""outside"" world  with the words that they use to talk about it!!!  What a laugh!  They  simply don't know what's going on and if they continue pretending like  they do know, they will only try to fool more people.  

All of  these ""experts"" think that they know what it is...  well, check this  out.  They don't even know how it was that they began ""thinking""!!!  Nor  do you...  They don't know what thought really is...  Nor do you...  I  don't either, that's the only thing that I can claim...  Complete  ignorance!  Meet me here and you will never be fooled again.  Nobody  will be able to get at you with words.  You won't even be able to get at  yourself with words or theories.  You'll drop the nonsense and dwell in  ""experiential reality"".  Everything will be as it was when you ""began"",  but you won't see yourself as something that began. A complete  mysterious, wonder... beyond all explanations.  Nothing will hold you  back, absolutely nothing.

Have a nice weekend.    : )",11May2019,0
1,"My cuz (F50's) has been having a time here of late in and out of hospital problems with her digestive track.  Was notified today she has cancer all over her body.

I use to play with her as a child playing catch, and tag your it.  She use to claw my arms up pretty good.  LOL.  But was too little to do any thing but run to get methialade put on the scratches.  She just loved to scratch me.  

I love her dearly as I do all my cousins.  I hate to see this happen to a wonderful person.  Worse because of my back surgery I cannot go help out.  Nor can I contribute for her hospitalization and care.  I just don't have the funds.

Might I add, I lost my Mom 2 years ago and my Sister just last year.  I am all of my nuclear family that is left.  2 bro's lost in accidents '74 and '93.  I am getting feeling pretty old now days.  Pray for her family!  She has 3 young men, 1 daughter and is a grand mother.  Her mom is still living and is aching that she cannot take care of her.

5,"You were just the new girl, the person sitting in the spot on the other side of my cube wall, where my friend had sat before moving to a different department. I don't recall ever formally meeting you, but that didn't stop us from chatting over the wall and joking together.


Later, we were working on a project together. Our daily interactions were nice. I remember once during this time when you wore a flowery dress and you left me stammering as I tried to discuss the latest issue and not stare at your legs and dress. I think you noticed, because you adjusted your position a little, but we never mentioned it.


Your English was very good, and it was clear you had a mastery of the language, but your accent was cute and lead to me eventually telling you I thought you were adorable. Later, you shared that you thought I was charming.


We both moved to different cube locations, still close, but not really close enough to casually talk over the wall. It was a bummer to be moved like that, but it made our efforts to talk more visible to me, that we'd have to stop by to purposefully have a chat. You were always a pleasure to talk to.


Learning you took another job broke my heart. We still talked, but our time was now limited. I guess our time here is always limited, it is just more noticable with a specified deadline. So, we had a goodbye lunch, and I shared my phone and email and said to not be a stranger.


I'm happy for your success, but I'm selfishly devastated. Life isn't fair, right? It seems like things could have been different, but I'm not sure how. I initially think maybe a different time, but thinking about our pasts, I don't see a spot that would work. So, I'm left with just wishing we could have met differently.


I'll miss you. This hurts, and I'll mourn. But, I don't regret meeting you and the time we spent together. And, I hope that I'm just a hopeless case, seeing things that weren't mutual because I wanted to see them, and that your thoughts of me are all the happy fun, but none of this pain.

It's no secret that we live in a world of people who want ""instant gratification."" And, I suppose it should be of no surprise either that many people don't want to put in the work to get certain things either.

Allow me to expand on this for a moment.

I'm not talking about ""ability,"" to which many people simply are not as capable as some others! I am speaking about ""attitude,"" to which I personally don't understand having a bad attitude (and not trying).

There was a time when I didn't work as hard for what I  was interested in, and that time passed with a little ""encouragement"" from others. But, I've noticed that ""encouragement"" can be tricky. In other words, being nice can get bite you in the ass!

19,"I realize she was a sort of toxic friend.  Whenever we got into arguments, which were usually small things like this character is better than that character, she would always manage, by the end of it, to twist into some thing about how she has no friends and the ones she have hate her and stuff like that.  I used to really enjoy her.  However, she told a friend of ours some personal information of mine.  That really upset me, and I took a step back from her for a few weeks.  Eventually, we fell back into how things used to be.  And a few days ago, we got into this satirical argument, or at least it was in my opinion, about how she had never had traditional ramen.  I was joking about it, like asking her what the toppings were or whatever, logical things to make sure she'd actually had it.  She refused to answer my questions, but at the same time saying she'd had it.  Anyhow, that was sort of stupid and I thought it was just a joke argument, which we get into all the time.  But then she did the thing she always does and said something along the line of, ""If you're going to assume I've never had ramen, I can assume you're a fake friend""  This hurt me for obvious reasons, and when I asked her why she would say that, she just said she her reasons.  Just now, she texted me and apologized about it, and said she'd never had reasons in the first place, just trying to prove a point that it was stupid I was assuming things.  I told her how much, even if it wasn't real, it still hurt me a lot. Now, she told me and a few other friends, that she has been fake to us the entire time we've been friends.  She said we would've made fun of her ""true/old self""  She made this assumption based off the time we spent in summer camp for two weeks when we were in 5th grade, which is ridiculous.  Anyways, I don't consider us friends anymore.

I'm in a tough spot, I'm dying, I was in a coma last year, was given 3 months to live almost 13 months ago. I really did a number on my liver due to excessive drinking over the course of my early adult life. I drank my feelings away for a long *long* time.  
  
Ever since I woke up from my coma my life has progressively gotten harder and harder. I developed my motor skills, learned to walk again etc etc. I got sober with a few relapses and a stint in rehab thrown in for good measure.

I've done everything I've ever *wanted* to do except for getting married.  
  
Is it wrong for me to want or crave affection and love knowing that I could be rushed to the hospital and not come back at any time? 
  
And as a plus, if I were to get married I could finally have someone respect my wishes and NOT resistate me if I die on the table again. (I don't have another physical recovery in me... That shits hard)

I have to think extremely deeply about every word i say. I don't have much to say really that isn't already being said, but...

I'm not the best person. Let me start by saying that. I just want to live an OK life, unhindered by the problems of extreme emotional discontrol. I'm an awkward, cryptic, middle aged, weirdo nerd bastard, deeply into videogames and bizarre sexual preferences.

I struggle to connect. Ever since i was 16 or 17, it has been a challenge at best to say what i mean, much less stick to my word and trust that others mean what they say at any given moment. People hardly disappointed me but they sure have talked enough shit to make me erroneously remember that they did and continue to.

Maybe I'm crazy. Maybe I'm detached from reality. Maybe i trust nobody because there was nobody or anything trustworthy enough to trust during my fragile teenage years, spent in an extremely foreign country, distant as all could be from even my closest family, far from who i ever felt i truly was, or even had the potential to be.

I just want to live an OK life. I'm so tired. I'm so fatigued. I like nobody at this moment, even though i have in the past. I'm emotionally stupid. I'm well educated. I didn't complete the entirety of my studies. I'm so lucky, and yet whatever is going on in my head is so twisted that at this moment it literally has no meaning for me.

I need help. I have so many twisted secrets that even my tens of journals from the past 5 years aren't ready for.

So, i damage myself. I isolate. I hurt my relationships. I abuse substances and i disregard any potential and existing relationships. I hurt myself on purpose because that's the only thing that releases any steam. I don't hate myself, and i don't really hate people, but the idealism from my youth still defines my worldview, and it hurts so much to see and feel so much vicarious pain that i feel like i want to destroy reality, in whatever way is possible.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 19F who's friends with 24M (we'll call V) and 29M (we'll call D). I became friends with these men when I was much younger and more ignorant, they have been my substitute brothers and a huge part of my childhood/life. Both of them live in New York  and we've all been openly friends for 5+ years, V &amp; D don't talk as often with each other but I keep in good contact with both. For a few years, D and I have gotten close (more so than I am with V), our relationship is definitely a supportive big brother/annoying little sister dynamic where as V and I have a more chill relationship but still big brother/little sister dynamic. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, D has been considerably more close to me which I found suspicious, when I told V about it he said that D has an interest in me, partially due to being legal. I ignored him knowing V is joking and D has explicitly told me there would be nothing more. During this interaction, V expressed his own sexual interest in me which again, I ignored due to V's usual humor. Later, V continues to talk about sexual themes with me, despite having a girlfriend of a few years. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where it gets messy. I ended up caving in, I was also sexually attracted to V and have been for a while which resulted in me sending and receiving some explicit messages to V.  V and I have been messaging more frequently with light flirting throughout, I feel guilty because of his girlfriend but I have no way to contact her to tell her about this. I asked him of pictures of himself since I hadn't seen him in a while, he was still as attractive as I remembered which just reinforces how I feel about him. V and I had talked about meeting, getting high and hooking up to have kinky sex while I was there to see both him and D. I have accepted that our dynamic has definitely changed and I know there's no romantic future between us due to him being taken plus our personalities are too similar to be functional, I believe I'm only attracted to him due to us having similar childhoods (abusive parents) and turning to weed to cope, he also makes me feel important and desirable. Despite knowing how wrong it is and how I feel, I still want him even if I would be a homewrecker. 

&amp;#x200B;

I explained to D that V found me sexually attractive and he immediately became cold to me, he asked for pictures of V (which I didn't have at the time), asked if I was also interested in him, and became overall irritated with the situation which made me more suspicious. After showing my roommate, she mentioned that D might actually have interest in me despite what D tells me due to the context of our messages and how cold he got when I mentioned that V had sexual interest in me. I still don't believe he would have interest in me but I feel like it's important to note due to our relationship dynamic. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to have sex with V badly, I know how horrible it is but, as bad as it sounds, I can't help how I feel. I know he's shitty for cheating and I shouldn't enable that behavior. D doesn't know I want and have been planning to have sex with V and I feel like he would get upset if he found out. I don't want to lose my friends I consider my brothers. I don't know what to do, V is very attractive and our relationship has already turned sexual so there's no coming back. I just feel confused.",11May2019,1
32,"I just moved for for the summer to a new town.  I got a job offer for a 4 month student position at a great company, which I was really excited about after months of searching for a summer/school-related position. 

&amp;#x200B;

The job offer happened when I was visiting my SO across country, and came as a (lovely, but genuine) surprise. I had a week to organize things and cancel some plans. At the top of my list was finding a room to rent in the town I was moving to for the summer. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finding a room in a house was a pretty easy process this time around, which I was incredibly thankful for. I called a landlord, the room that was posted was already taken but he had another. Great. He was friendly, showed me around the house via Skype, and that was that. Everything was straightforward, and the paperwork was done within a few days.

&amp;#x200B;

I spent most of the day in transit today, lugging around everything I would need in a backpack and giant suitcase. It was exhausting, and finally arriving at the house was such a relief. I was excited to get settled in, unpack, shower and sleep like a fucking rock.

&amp;#x200B;

The landlord unlocks and opens the door to the room I've rented out, and immediately this warm waft of pungent air hits my face. He comments, ""the rooms been closed, it's a bit stinky. Just needs to be aired out."". 

&amp;#x200B;

It smells like cat piss.

&amp;#x200B;

I grew up with cats, and it's a smell that I can't stand. Instant headache. I've spent the last few hours with the door and window open, with a great smelling candle lit, and the room and mattress smell awful. I forced myself to take a nap on the bed, over a freshly washed sheet, to try and manage my headache. The bed smells musty, my sheet smells musty, and the lingering smell of piss is up my nose. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am incredibly upset, wound up, and pretty angry with myself for not asking more questions and for more photos/information about the room. The landlord seems like a genuinely nice dude, so I messaged him telling him that I likely would not be able to stay, because I wasn't willing for my belongings, or myself, to pick up the smell. I'm still waiting for a reply. I don't want to be the person at work who has an odour problem.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm angry, depressed, filled with anxiety, and now I smell like pee.

The second minute, he said something to the effect of me being upset. So I said hurtful things. I told him to leave the room since I don’t do anything good around him. I asked him to leave since I only made him so upset, that I rile him up- almost consuming him. 


Then he cried. 

It was subtle at first until he didn’t want to remove his arms covering my face. It hurts to see. 

I love this guy. But I guess sometimes, there is too much touching and it’s not what they want or what they need. So I let him be.



He left after a few minutes and I am stuck here. I wish we’d never forget how to take care of each other because this is a stressful time for the both of us. And I know that life isn’t always strawberries and peaches.

I know he’d come around though, I know we would come back stronger from this. We always do.",11May2019,9
35,"I’m only young (19) and I try not to dramatise the events in my life because I know there are people much older than me who have gone through so much worse and I don’t want to act like I’ve got it worse than them. All things considered my life has been pretty good, but for the longest time those I’ve loved have hurt me and abandoned me sometimes without me ever knowing what happened to them. I’ve never been sure of who I am or who I truly love or what really matters to me. At times I’ve felt like literally nobody because of how lost i’ve become and feel completely untethered from reality like I’m dead.

For the last year I’ve been with someone who I know I truly love. Someone that no matter their flaws they’re still perfect to me in my eyes. I don’t wanna sound like a cheesy teen but she’s been more than just a girlfriend and a friend. She’s brought out my true self and shown me who I really am. In my mind she’s everything thats great about life and although I am usually very philosophical and logical and scientific, I know she’s my soulmate. 

She isn’t the only reason I’m happy, but without her idk if I’d even be here. I used to see life as such a painful existence. I never thought being this wrong could be so beautiful.",11May2019,2

39,"I’m a sophomore in high school and generally known as the laid-back kind of guy that everyone gets along with. I’m usually pretty quiet and don’t say too much except to my close friends. I’ve been pretty happy with this kind of lifestyle, but lately I just feel like something is lacking. I’ve had no progress getting in any sort of romantic relationship and I’ve had to watch all my friends have their own success among their romantic lives while I’m left behind. I definitely wouldn’t say I’m unattractive but I’ve been holding myself back because I have bad social anxiety. I spend a lot of my time just sitting in my room playing video games and watching anime. But I do exercise most days of the week. I guess I’m rambling on a bit but I guess my main problem is that I just keep finding myself in an inescapable boredom with no one to lean on but myself. I feel like I’m lacking someone/something special to hold on to . As someone who’s going of to college in the near future, I don’t want to spend four years of my life in a torturous boredom away from home with no one except myself and my own thoughts.

41,"Ok so I wanna say first off that I’m not the type of person that thinks highly of sleeping with people while drunk, i usually try and avoid that kind of thing. But I was young and dumb and let myself get too out of hand. 

Back when I was 19 my parents were out of the house for a couple weeks and one night my cousin came over to hangout and asked if he could invite some of his friends over for drinks. I said sure and then we all got pretty sauced, towards then end of the night I ended up in my bed with a couple girls, things started happening between me and the one and after fooling around a bit we got up to go to another room (to avoid waking her friend up) and after a few minutes she stopped me and said she had to get back to her friend. So I backed off and she got up and went back to my bed to sleep. In the morning she must have left before I woke up cause I don’t think I saw her. In all honestly I was so wasted I don’t even remember what she looks like....anyways I just feel like shit about the whole thing. I found out the next day that she was only like 15 or 16!She was young and i just feel like sleeping around while you’re intoxicated is sleezy to begin with. 

So I’m almost 22 now, and it’s popped up in my head from time to time and for whatever reason I just can’t get past it. I just feel so bad, the weight of the guilt is killing me. So I reached out to my cousin who i haven’t seen in forever and tried to get the girls name or figure out who she was. And after talking to him I think I found her on Facebook, so I sent her a message trying to apologize for that night and being drunk and sleeping with her and all. She hasn’t read it yet (been a few days since I sent that apology) But I feel like apologizing was the right thing to do. It was a mistake and I’m really not that kind of person at all. I don’t think of myself as a shitty person but idk....I guess part of me is worried It’ll come back to haunt me in a bigger way. But I genuinely feel bad for letting myself get into that situation and going through with that. 

Anyone have any thoughts or advice? Sorry I’m new to this subreddit and idk if this is the place for this but I figured I’d give it a try (also this is a throwaway account)

I only have 3 or 4 friends left here now and one of them is her roommate. Its hard for me to get over the relationship since I always get little hints on her life through him. For example he calls me on his way home from a party they were together and talks to me about his problems and stuff, but the only thing I think about at that moment is : ""Wow cool, since she's not with him on their way home ( he wouldn't call me when she's with him) she obviously went home with the guy she's lied to me about before we broke up and started dating with a few weeks after."" I can't blame my friend. It must be weird for him too, to switch between friends and trying to avoid talking about the ex.

I'm [M17] gay but have a history too long to get into and right now I'm fucked up on painkillers since I relapsed after a few months of clean time and idk why but I decided to tell my mom that they hit me. It never hurt too bad, but it was often and I had bruises. I never hit back or first or anything, I dont get it. I mean I kind of get it, the first one was because I told school counselors she was having mental issues and self harming (even in class, I had to stop her myself from fucking stabbing her self with pencils siccors and digging into her skin with her nails) along with telling her I was questioning my sexuality and her disagreeing with my politics and religion and just about everything else I am. It was shitty and abusive and left me in the psych hospital, though I've had issues since 7th grade and it wasn't my first time. The other was a secret relationship that my parents still dont know was more than best friends (I did it cause I was scared for her life and didn't know how to say no, more on that in a sec). She has terrible terrible mental illness including some form of rapid cycle bipolar involving delusions and hallucinations and shit, I dont want to get into it I'm about to start crying again and I dont want to wake my parents up. Anyways whenever we had some intimacy (not even sexual stuff, just like hugging and cuddling) She would go cold and turn away and reject anything I tried including talking and asking what was wrong and almost always it escalated to her hitting me. I can still ""feel"" it, but like I said before it wasn't that bad pain wise but it fucked and continues to fuck me up. Almost forgot, me and both of them are terribly codependent. 
I told my mom about the hitting from both of them, not why but that it happened, and she kept asking me if it was jokingly or playful, didn't really validate what I was saying but didn't exactly dismiss it either. I thought i was making some progress even if I fucked up and broke sobriety again, idk. I'm sorry guys, I can't fucking format right now and I'm shaking and trying not to wake my family up with my fucking pathetic crying. This all sounds really pretentious and ""look at me I have issues"" and I'm sorry, I just had to do something and none of my friends are responding rn.

She gave her shift away tonight and mine got cancelled tomorrow but she still doesn’t want to stay over. Said she’s too tired from hanging out with sister and her friends today which is fair enough I guess. She did ask me to pick her up but I’m just too sick to drive, thought she would want to come look after me but guess not. 


She shows me no affection anymore. Never kisses me. Annoyed that I touch her bum so much. I guess she has been extra stressed these past 2 weeks which is pretty explanatory.

For all those who feel that they are socially awkward, dorks, nerds and anything of the like, i just want to say that hang in there. You (we) are not as awkward as you (we) are. Yesterday i went for a hike with some folks who were friends of my friend. My friend unfortunately could not make it, so I had to go with 3 unknown guys. I thought that this was one of those wasted days where I would just say quiet the entire trip and end up spoiling the hike for myself.

I was so wrong! The guys made me feel so comfortable that by the end of the trip we ended up exchanging numbers and talk once in a while. I opened up with them, stared stories, listened to their experiences and had a wonderful time. Not a very big achievement, but for me it was - considering that i'm in my mid 20s and never dated, kissed or had sex. It made me realize that I am not as much of a social recluse as I thought I was.

55,"*‘Graphic designer, entrepreneur, adventurer, easily distracted by sausage dogs.’* 

&amp;#x200B;

My brief and witty dating profile description that has gained me over **15,000 matches on Tinder** and countless messages about sausage dogs, but only a handful of dates. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I grow ever closer to the big three-oh and find myself single once again, I’ve had to question what getting a match actually means anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Initially, Tinder couldn’t have come at a better time for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

After graduating from university in 2012 and taking some time out to go travel, I found myself working for a tech start-up in central London and living with a Canadian and two Australians in a small house in Greenwich. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn’t actually know anyone else that lived here. Fortunately, this was also the year I discovered Tinder. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went to museums, galleries, Starbucks, rode the Underground every day, and not once did a girl ever come up to me and say hi. Nor did the opportunity ever arise for me to naturally spark up a conversation that led to a date. The movies lied. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, Tinder it was. Swipe, swipe, swipe, match, match, match. Lots of girls actually talking to me. Amazing!

&amp;#x200B;

It wasn’t hard to set up a compelling profile. A few well-chosen photos showing off my good side, a handful from my travels, and one of that time I wore a suit. 

&amp;#x200B;

My brief description played to my strengths: ambitious, adventurous, has a sense of humour – all subjective of course (but hey, I was trying to sell myself here). Somehow ‘pedantic, only goes on holiday when money allows and laughs at own jokes’ didn’t sound as good. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went on a few dates, had some fun experiences, and even had a long-term relationship come out of it.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s hard to say why my now ex stood out from all the other faces. She was spontaneous, which is something I really like – she agreed to go on a date without any bulls\*it or games, and we hit it off. That certainly doesn’t happen every time. 

&amp;#x200B;

But once the honeymoon period was over, however, we both had to do some real soul searching and decide if we could actually see ourselves spending the rest of our lives together. 

&amp;#x200B;

So back to Tinder it was. 

&amp;#x200B;

As time went on however, the app seemed to change, and so did my experience of using it. My swiping got faster, and people’s bios became more trivial. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most people’s bios either didn’t really tell me anything about them, or most just felt compelled to specify they weren’t looking for ‘hook-ups’.

&amp;#x200B;

I was mainly swiping out of boredom, focusing solely on people’s first image. The matches soon racked up. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn’t truly consider if I could see myself dating someone until we’d matched, or they’d sent me a message. If a conversation with a girl didn’t go perfectly right away, new matches would inevitably push her further down the list and I couldn’t help but forget her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everybody started to become the same person. The question would then become ‘well, why would I want to pursue this girl, over this other girl’ when I knew nothing really about either. Leaving me back at square one and back to swiping. Rinse, lather, repeat.

&amp;#x200B;

I’d managed to get over 15,000 matches and yet I was still single and still with no sausage dog. After my 28th birthday it started to dawn on me that out of all my friends, I was the only one not in a relationship and the prospect of dying alone was quickly approaching. 

&amp;#x200B;

It prompted me to make my own dating app called **Attrct – The Story Dating App**, where people share stories, much like on Instagram but only people you have matched with can see. 

&amp;#x200B;

Relationships aren’t built in a swipe. I think it takes time to really get to know someone and to get a sense of who’s really worth pursuing, and who’s not. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t think that finding love ‘online’ is a lost cause – or that romance is dead. I just think the quick wins have blurred people’s focus on what they were originally looking for. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was returning to Tinder, day after day, simply for the ego boost. Even if it was purely superficial, I enjoyed the fact that somebody had matched with me. It was like them saying they found me attractive – who doesn’t like hearing that? 

&amp;#x200B;

But once the moment was over, I would then just be after the next one, and it never ends. 

&amp;#x200B;

My priorities in life are changing. The endless matching culture we seem to have fallen into just doesn’t cut it for me anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I want to spend my time more wisely in the search of something real, getting to know what people are really about, and discover who I truly have a connection with. 

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of falling into the trap of constantly looking for somebody new to match, I want to really get to know the people I already have. 

&amp;#x200B;

Who knows, maybe that special someone is already there?

56,"After high school I spent 3 years in crippling anxiety and depression because of the pressures of figuring out the rest of my life. I spent a literal year in my house and isolated myself from my friends because I felt that I didn’t deserve to have any crises they were all taking steps forward in their lives. While I spent all day in bed doing nothing, no work, no school, nothing. In my isolation I found someone truly special to me, we started a long distance relationship and I loved her dearly. She gave me some motivation to actually do something with my life so I decided I was going to try and be an EMT. All I’ve ever wanted to do was help people and I thought this would be a good way to do that. I signed up for a course but found out it was way too rigorous for me to handle, so I dropped out and joined an easier one with the financial help of my parents. I was about halfway into the course when I ended up being in a car accident. My friend was driving and was looking through his phone to play a song, I was also focused on my phone texting my girlfriend but she was ignoring me which was a little out of character for her. Since she was ignoring me I closed my phone and looked at the road ahead only to see ya speeding towards a stationary car, I warn my friend in haste and he manages to hit the brakes just in time for us to not kill ourselves but we ended up hitting the car anyway. I came out of the accident with a broken thumb somehow. I found out later that the reason my girlfriend was ignoring me was because she was with another guy, cheating on me. So the only reason I’m alive today was because the love of my life was cheating on me. That’s a sick cosmic joke I’ve ever heard one. Due to my injury I had to leave the course I was taking because it was very hands on. I got a partial refund and my parents were livid with me that I made them waste their money. So I had to drop the course, my girlfriend left me and I couldn’t find work with a broken thumb. I was back to begin at home doing nothing again, through no choice of my own and was worse off that were I started. That had to be the lowest point of my life up until that point, believe it or not it gets worse down the line. Thankfully this was only for one month, which I find extremely bizarre because it sincerely felt like a year. My friend helped me get an interview at Costco for a seasonal position and my girlfriend came back to me. And although I had a job and I had my girlfriend I couldn’t get over what she’d done. I was stuck in the past and found it impossible to forgive her fully. I became mentally abusive towards her, I accused her of still cheating on me and became extremely paranoid among other things. She already suffered from mental issues herself and I was making it worse. I was angry at her and I was angry at myself especially. I fucking hated myself for treating her that way. It’s hard to put into words how sincerely much I fucking HATED myself. A couple weeks pass and I eventually find out that she hadn’t gotten out the relationship that she left me for. I think a part of me died that day. I stayed with her, she convinced me she was only in it because it was difficult for her to break it off because he never did anything wrong. I think at that point I knew I was never going to be able to trust her again, she made me feel like I was crazy the whole time and I ended up being right. She broke it off with him and we went on with our lives together. The following months we were together was me being even more paranoid accusing her of cheating and verbally abusing her and more. It eventually became to much for her and she left me for someone else. Even though she had done all that I still loved her, I sincerely wanted to forgive her and move past it but it was extremely difficult. I was heart broken. Two months after the break up I took some magic mushrooms and I felt like for the first time in my life, I was alive. Turns out magic mushrooms are are excellent in treating depression. Everything seemed so easy, I decided I was going to finally start school and major in psychology. Again all I’ve ever wanted to do was to help people and what better way to do that than to help others who’re going through tough times in their lives. Before school started my girlfriend came back to me again and this time we were going to do things right. I was the happiest I’ve ever been at that point. I was going to school and taking steps to a real future for myself, I worked as a cashier at a McDonald’s, which may be something weird to be happy about but it was work and I had the love of my life back again. I know it may seem like I’m trying to demonize her here but I’m not. Most of the things she did were reactionary to my actions. I couldn’t let go of the past but I sincerely loved her. Months go by and everything is peachy, one reason I didn’t want to go to school was because I always felt like I was really dumb but it turned out that I’m actuality academically inclined. I did really well in my classes. I eventually left the job at McDonald’s for a better job elsewhere but it didn’t work out. I was jobless again but it was a mere bump in the road at this point. Months go by and I maintain good grades and out of the blue I get a job that paid really well for my standards. So at this point I had a decent job, a loving girlfriend and was killing it in school. Things however took a turn at some point and I fell back into the paranoia of my girlfriend cheating on, me among other issues. We slowly slipped back to our old ways and our relationship deteriorated. My job also went through a transitionary period and I wasn’t working again and the next semester for school hadn’t started. I was at home again doing nothing. Things only got worse for me and my girlfriend at this point and she left me again for someone else. I was a toxic person and she couldn’t handle it anymore. It so happened that I was also out of a job again, as the transitory period became permanent. Which brings me to now, $5000 in debt, mostly on trips from visiting my girlfriend, out of a job and dealing with my failure of keeping the person I love most in this world by my side. I’ve done so well in school that I was accepted into the honors program and a somewhat prestigious honor society but as of right but it’s painfully difficult to even get out of bed, let alone maintain good grades. I still have all As but I have an important essay I need to complete soon and I can’t for the life of me, even start it. I also don’t have the will or motivation to look for work, I know I’ll only be able to get a job as a cashier at a fast food restaurant or something. So here I am now having to get a job to pay for expenses on trips I took to see my ex-girlfriend, watching my slow but definite descent into academic failure, missing my girlfriend to the point of physical pain and having less than zero motivation or will power to do anything about it all. I feel like I’m at the end of my rope here, I have no one to talk about all this pain I’m feeling or lack of any feeling. Sometimes I just want to go to sleep so I won’t be conscious. Ever after all that, I don’t think I’ve ever seriously considered suicide but it just seems so easy right now.",11May2019,0

I just wish I wasn’t such trash and had friends besides the people who want to sleep with me.

I've been live streaming games on Twitch for a while now (no plug here) and I do it solely for fun. Still, I'm regularly accused of using my cleavage for attention. I don't accept donations or give out my social media profiles, so I have no reason to try and ""attract"" people to my channel. I do love interacting with my audience, and all I ask is that you enjoy the gameplay, and hopefully I'm interesting enough of a personality to keep you around. I'm well aware that there are going to be those people who only watch me because of the way I look, and that's fine and all, but I'd rather it be because I'm a decent person who plays fun, interesting games.

I wear clothing for comfort. Nothing beats coming home from work and switching out to a nice tank top and shorts to wind down, especially during these warmer months of the year, and it's something I do whether I'm streaming or not. I'm sorry, but I'm not going to make myself uncomfortable for the sole purpose of satisfying people who are triggered by the sight of my boobs.

It's part of the female body, and not every woman uses it for attention. Heck, I think having big boobs is overrated and I'd rather not have them, but forking out the money that I'd rather use to pay my bills and afford the things I need just isn't feasible at the moment.

I'm sorry if it offends people, but I just want to be myself and as comfortable as possible so I can enjoy doing what I love, and if it means that I need to regularly put up with comments from people who think there's some ulterior motive when there isn't, then so be it.",11May2019,17

(This is not for the feint of heart, as this is more of ""I really need advice"")

A few months ago, I was talking to some friends on discord (just texting, not voicechat), and one of those friends had other friends over at the time. Turns out, that friend had sex plans and tried to rape her. I managed to get someone to kick him out, and all's good, right?

Wrong.

Earlier this night, I was talking to one of my other friends, and they met the same guy that tried to rape the other girl. I told them to be extremely careful, turns out for some fucking reason she invited him over, and she got raped aswell.

All I know is that he said something along the lines of ""I'll do this everyday"" to her. I tried bringing up the cops, but for some reason, NOBODY WOULD DO THAT. I live in a different state, which really limits my options.

Any suggestions or advice? I'm very stressed out and have no clue on what's the right thing to do.

I haven’t been able to find a job, and I’m behind on bills and stuff, and it just... wears on me. I’ve been applying to places, but I haven’t gotten a response from anyone besides the negative. 
I also lost my support system. Everyone’s at least 3-4 hours away, so I can’t go to them. I’m not that social of a person, and find it hard to talk to new people, much less with everything else going on. I’m just... tired.

I’ve been hospitalized twice, I get extremely stressed out and don’t know how to handle it anymore and break down. I’ve also been made fun of for most of my life, which made school even worse. Every year I would have at least 30 absences, but typically more. In October I started doing online school. Because I missed so many days, they placed me back to sophomore year even though I was supposed to be a junior.

By the second semester I was a junior, and now next year I’m going to be a senior! I’m really proud of myself. There were so many times that I thought about just dropping out and not finishing school at all. But I’m doing it! I get to graduate next year! And my teacher is so nice, one of the best teachers I’ve ever had if not the best. She knows I’m mentally ill and let’s me talk to her and has taken me out for lunch when she’s in town. 

I’m just so happy, and I’m so proud of myself. Ideally I’d like to go to college, but I’m not completely sure if I can handle it.

65,"When I was about 11/13 years old, I was on holiday in Greece with my parents. We were staying in a pretty huge private villa, and throughout the time we were there (about two weeks) a number of groups, and backpackers came to the villa, or pool, or wherever we were and asked if we had any rooms available. We told them all that it was a villa, and not a hotel, and they all left and we never really got any hassle.

I was in a room on my own, but instead of a swinging door to the room, there were roller shutter doors. I shut these every night religiously when I went to bed and it was always the last thing I did.

One night, I woke up to the scraping noise the roller shutter doors made when they were slid open. I opened my eyes but kept completely still assuming it was just one of, or both of my parents, and not wanting them to be annoyed that I was awake. What I saw was a woman wearing a red sarong, and a man stood behind her. They opened both doors - sliding them away from eachother, and both stuck their heads in the door. I could see that it WAS NOT my parents. At this point I wasn't remaining still because I wanted to, I was frozen in fear. The woman came into my room a little more, and looked right at me for a few seconds. Then both of them backed out of the room, and left. Neither of them shut the roller shutter doors.

After what felt like an age, but was probably only two or three minutes, I got up out of bed. I was absolutely terrified but was a relatively ballsy kid and if something was going on - I wanted to know about it. I walked the whole of the villa, and looked at each and every door and window. The two people were nowhere to be seen and all the doors and windows were locked. This I remember vividly.

I went back to bed, still scared but assuming that it was my parents (I hadn't gone into their room as their door was closed, I imagined still from when they'd gone to bed). I didn't touch my (now open) roller shutter doors, and left them as they were. When we all got up in the morning the first thing I checked was my doors. Still open. As I hadn't touched them, I knew someone else had to have. It was either my parents or two strangers who had gained access to the villa.

I went and found my parents and asked them. They told me - no, we went to bed all at the same time, and they'd only come out of their room about 10 minutes ago. And they definitely hadn't come in during the night. My dad checked all the ways in and they seemed to be locked.

However, my doors were still open and I hadn't touched them. My parents also denied doing so.

Years and years later, my parents still tell me I must have been dreaming, and promise me that the two strangers weren't them.

67,"On May 8, 2019, NBC News censored the “OK” sign.

This was part of a story where a man flashed the sign (👌) behind a black broadcaster at a Chicago Cubs game. The OK sign, of all things, has been under scrutiny lately, after a troll post on 4chan somehow convinced the real world it means “white power.” There are no origin stories that prove this, and the sign has more or less existed as an alternative to “thumbs up” (👍) for many years. Now, “white supremacists” have apparently adopted this common sign as a signal.

This is a real test of speech and expression. How easy is it for everyday expressions to be co-opted by bad groups? Evidently, really easy. All you need is a post online somewhere and some traction on social media, and you’ll have a report by a news organization that treats your idea seriously. If you’re lucky, it’ll be a major network, like NBC, blurring the sign meaning “good,” turning it into a new age middle finger.

How do we fix this? Easy. Everyone just start using it. And if you haven’t stopped using it, don’t stop. High profile minorities should make videos flashing it. High profile straight white males should too. If everyone is using it, then it goes right back to where it was: the positive “I’m good” sign.

But if we keep censoring it, keep calling out people for (innocently or not) using it, then we risk actually turning it into a slur.

Let’s not let our language, particularly our positive language, be redefined by a small minority of losers. Please use your “OK” sign today.",11May2019,2

70," For such an individualistic and self-obsessed society, the West has surprisingly few transparent cars on its roads showcasing the beautiful bodies of its drivers.

Perhaps that's because the body position we'd be revealing through the car's clear outer shell would hardly be flattering. I guess if you have a nice pair of legs then it might be worth your while, but our bodies would basically be fixed in a Lego position - which, for both driver and spectator, becomes dull, fast, after the initial moment of novelty.

If the advent of driverless cars ever arrives en masse then it would resolve the issue, allowing human 'drivers' the freedom to move around as they wish within their vehicles whilst traveling, along with the new freedom to distract and promote themselves to other humans also traveling on roads in automated vehicles.

A new market for content is then created as vehicles on roads inadvertently become mobile personal theatres/videos/adverts circulating throughout society, saturating public consciousness even further with incessant projections of our banal ideas, ideals, and idealised selves. The tranquility found in cruising down an open road with a mind free to roam without obligation is then lost, replaced by another consumer-created environment in need of filtering.

Eventually those still choosing to drive the old-fashioned cars of yesteryear with bodywork of solid colour, are framed as laggards - old codgers - stuck in the past or even worse, deemed to be hiding something. Because if you have nothing to hide then you ought to be proving this by showing everybody everything all of the time, right?",11May2019,0

So while I was just kind of sitting there, enjoying the feeling and browsing social media, I saw one of my friends had posted a screenshot of a Reddit comment conversation where they blurred out their username, but not the person they were talking to. Being the snoopy fuck I am, I looked up that person’s comment history to see if I could find the conversation, and while the comment chain had been deleted, I noticed they frequented an aesthetic/porn subreddit that fit my friend’s aesthetic pretty well, so I go to the sub, not really expecting to find anything and BAM. There they were, titties hanging out and everything. I browse through their profile some before I get the brilliant idea to ask them about it. I was very curious, and we’d talked about doing a FWB thing in the past, so I figured it wouldn’t be a huge deal. They were understandably a bit upset that I’d found it, and I quickly realized that maybe mentioning this wasn’t the greatest idea, so I just apologized a bunch and we haven’t spoken since, and now I feel like I’ve kinda fucked up that friendship. I started feeling super anxious about the whole thing, and I was coming down from the ecstasy, so some part of me was just like “fuck it. I’ll just post my own nudes.” And I did just that.

I have it in both of my legs but it's worse in my left leg. And it causes me to be in very much pain if I'm walking for more than 15 minutes straight. (*That's exactly how much time it takes me to walk to school*)*.*

But there are many people, including some of my friends that don't believe me. They say that I'm just being lazy and that I should be outside more often and go for a run now and then.

Well, here is the thing, I'm overactive. And I take at least 6 short and intense walks every day. But since the pain started coming (*around last year, (I've found out about my condition a few weeks ago)*). I've started to take less and less walks.

Every time someone (*especially adults)* asks me why I don't go outside as much as I used to. I always tell them the truth and try to explain about my condition. They ALWAYS say that I'm wrong and just saying BS. That I'm just being a lazy lying brat and that there is no way I know what I'm talking about. Since I am just a child and not a scientist. And to be honest, the point were they tell me that I'm wrong is just another way for calling me a lier. And hearing that, hurts like hell and feels like a slap in my face or a sword in my heart. (*This has happened multiple times since I've found out about my condition*).

It just makes me want to scream: *If being outside and being active is supposed to be good for the human body and health. Why does it hurt like hell every time, everyday I'm outside and being active? Why in the damn hell am I laying on my bed crying in pain everyday after coming home from walking and being active?*

For brief background: I work in a luxury car dealership call center and as you might guess, we get some very frustrated, angry customers. It’s reasonable, I mean we’re talking about their CAR, and it’s an expensive car at that. You paid for it, you should be able to drive it. I get it. 

Anyway. About 3 days ago, we have a customer call. He is foreign, and does not seem to communicate his ideas too well. He is claiming that he dropped off a car (my coworkers assumed for service) and that there is a paper he needs signed and faxed inside the car. Strange ordeal, but not quite rare. My 4 coworkers are more confused every time he calls, and he is angrier each time as well. He keeps asking for people like our sales managers, parts managers, etc. and even claims that the car is our service manager’s “personal vehicle.”

I realized by listening to my coworkers’ sides of the TWENTY NINE CALLS we received from him over the past 3 days that he obviously was not looking for the people he claimed, but had seen their names on the papers he needed and clung to them. However, my coworkers were rather selfish and failed to listen to his needs fully. 

He was OUTRAGED today when he called. Day 4, and he is yelling, obviously frustrated, and very very upset with how he’s been treated. 

Now, I have a huge passion for customer service. I’m the weirdo whose smile is genuine and who actually cares about what you’re doing this weekend if you tell me. I’m a people person by definition, and it’s great for this job. 

He calls back and I immediately tell everyone in the room not to answer, I pick up the phone. I swear my coworkers are holding their breath waiting to hear how it does. 

C: (screaming in his Czech accent) THIS is the worst experience I’ve ever had BLAH BLAH BLAH I need to speak to the sales manager, etc. 

So I calmly wait for him to finish and say, “Okay, (Name). I am so sorry you’ve had this experience, I can’t imagine how frustrated you are. I would be upset too and it’s embarrassing that you are treated this way by my employees. Can I ask you something?”

He agrees, so I continue. “Sir, I don’t think you’ve been talking to the right people, and that’s our fault so I’m really sorry. You’ve probably explained before, but would you mind explaining exactly what is wrong to me one more time?”

He explains his situation, still a little angry-toned and snappy, and lo and behold, not a SINGLE person over the past few days has been the right one to talk to. Awkward. 

“Okay, thank you (name). I think I understand the situation now and I apologize for our lack of understanding” and I explain the situation back to him to make sure. 

So at this point I’m ready to transfer, and I get him down to the correct line. He gets disconnected as he’s driving through a bad area, and I answer when he calls again. I was surprised at how nice he was when I said “Hi (name), it’s (me) again, were you disconnected?” And he says “Yes, can I be transfer again please?” 

He was on the phone for about 15 minutes with the person, and hasn’t called back since. It’s been 2 hours since our last encounter and I am fully confident that his issue was resolved. 

TL;DR— i was a decent person to an angry customer and resolved a 3-day-long, 31-phone-call problematic situation with him in no time at all. I’m proud and want to share with someone who doesn’t know me because I annoy my friends with work stories a lot(: but this is why I work in customer service! I love it!",11May2019,7
102,"Ok so today I learned something that made want to share this story. 

So I enlisted in the marine corps a few months ago. As time went by my fitness level started going down due to how badly we are fed over there. In the beginning  I thought I was the only one but as time went by other people started saying this too. 

Well, there was one drill instructor who used to hate my guts and idfk why. He would get anything he could get his claws on to pick on me. As I said before, my fitness level started decreasing which meant less pull ups. At some point he started full on humiliating me. We’d be done with chow and he’d be like “hit the pull up bars” and I’d be like alright good we doing pull ups but then as time went by and he saw me actually trying em he went from pull ups to gathering the platoon around only me doing pull ups and having them watch while commenting shit. Then people would volunteer to help me do assisted pull ups and he’d be like “no” so we’d just be there staring at me for ten minutes trying to get up the bar. 

Because of this everyone thought I absolutely sucked at anything physical. I started getting comments like “damn (name) I didn’t even see you at the run how far did you fall out?” And “do you even do the hikes? I never see you” etc stuff like that. Except what no one knew (thanks to this DI) is that my fitness level was pretty high.. I’d always be at the front of the runs, I was the first person at the hikes, at times I even took the squad leaders place in formation from them falling out.  Etc. so today at MCT I learned I actually had a first class pft score which is the best pft classification (there’s first second and third class) 

Oh and at chow I’d be literary the only person who would try to eat as healthy as possible and from then to time (like 2x a month) id get a cookie and he’d be like “oh so now you can get cookies?” Bitch you just walked past the whole platoon who got brownies and cookies and fucking ice cream and you come to me? Nice. But ya oh and my crunches were 134 and run time is 18min which for both are maxed out. 

When we first got to MCT the DI was like “if you’re a bad hiker  get to the front” and everyone was like “my name” and I didn’t even say anything and I just went to the front 🤷‍♂️ hey at least that DI did some unintentional good lmao made MCT easier for me",11May2019,0

106,"Recently, I posted here about the passing of my fiancee. Thank you all again for your comments. I did not anticipate what the words of internet strangers would do for my mental health, but my spirits were lifted. I want to share a happier story.

&amp;#x200B;

When she passed away, I wasn't just hurt- our entire friend group was devastated. Jeff especially. Jeff and I were coworkers at first. And Jeff was a dick. Awful attitude for work, dismissive towards bettering his attitude. Shit- we almost fired Jeff. But through mutual friends, Jeff and I started playing in the same DND group. And you know what? Jeff wasn't such a bad guy. His dismissive attitude was just an air of inherent sarcasm. I actually started to see him smile and be human. And then his fiancee split with him...

&amp;#x200B;

I watched Jeff fall apart. Every day I could see the circles getting darker under his eyes. Jeff wasn't a native to our city, and didn't have a huge friend group. At this point, my fiancee and I were just getting to know him, and were about to start hosting another DND game of our at our house. She suggested we invite him. Gods, she was caring that way. I invited him with some apprehension, not entirely happy at the fact.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll spare you the bromantical details, but Jeff and I became best friends. There was one instance, before he left for the night, where he very honestly told my fiancee and myself ""You guys are my best friends."" When we found out she was murdered, he was the second person over to my house. He didn't leave here for a week. He wasn't going to leave me alone. And now, months later, he's my roommate. No longer coworkers, he works at a newer local game shop that's become a big central hub for the Magic the Gathering and DND scene. 

&amp;#x200B;

Like myself, and most people in their late 20s, Jeff has his own run-ins with depression. And on top of this, he's sort of a misanthrope. Recently he was telling me how annoying the kids at the shop can be. They're loud, they don't buy much, etc. I used to be ONE of those kids. I remember being 8 or 9, it's 1999 and America still feels innocent. My mom would drop me off at the LGS store and I would play the Pokemon TCG or what not for hours without spending a dime. Eventually however, I got on to the real cardboard crack. Magic the Gathering. Tim, the owner of the shop I frequented, taught me how to play, would give me the occasional free pack, help me deck build. The local card shop was the cornerstone of the community, and even though I was probably a little shit to the employees of that shop, I remember those days fondly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before he leaves for work, I always make it a point to tell him to have a good day. Yesterday, as I could see he was looking pretty down, I say ""Jeff, make a kid's day at the store. I'm going to ask you about it when you get home."" He just laughs it off and leaves.

&amp;#x200B;

Time passes. Jeff gets home. I ask. And with this small smile on this face he says ""I actually did make a kid's day today.""

&amp;#x200B;

He goes on to tell me how this one lad's buddies didn't show up like they usually do, and he was all alone. He was too shy to ask the older teenagers or adults to play a game of Magic, so Jeff just walked up and asked him what was going on. Jeff spent the next hour or so optimizing the kid's deck, teaching him some of the more nuanced intricacies of the game, and even filled out the holes in his deck with free cards; most of them from Jeff's personal collection rather than the store's. Jeff went on for 30 minutes telling me this story. 

&amp;#x200B;

And most of the time he told the story, he had a smile on his face.

107,"I just want to punch and strangle them. This is why I will never have kids, nor do I offer to babysit for anyone. It’s also a big part of the reason I left the Mormon church, because if you don’t know, the pressure for girls to pop out baby after baby is HUGE in that culture. I can’t imagine a God who would be so inflexible with his plan that he would expect everyone to follow the same life path, but I digress.

Anyway, I’ve pretty much always been this way. I’ve always hated little kids, especially when they’re causing a fuss. My heart starts racing, my face turns hot, and I have to remove myself from the situation immediately. If I’m walking past a crying brat in the store, I will instantly turn around and get the hell out of the area. 

I’m also not a fan of hearing people cough, but I don’t get nearly as angry over that. I don’t have violent fantasies or anything, it just bugs me. But I know for a fact I could NEVER be a parent, because I’m certain I’d be one of those that ends up on the news for shaking their kid to death in a rage or something. That doesn’t bother me, because I really don’t like little kids anyway. I don’t find them cute. If that makes me a bitch, I don’t care. I figure at least I have the self-awareness to know my limits and understand how ugly things could get if I’m put in a high stress situation.

115,"It's getting pretty annoying to the point where I feel like I can't say anything, because whatever I say will either A) be unnecessarily questioned, or B) be ""offensive"" to someone.

Let me give you an example- today, she was watching this video about a lesbian dance club. She said she didn't know they existed, and asked me where I thought the club was. I guessed NY or LA. Instead of just accepting my guess, she started questioning why I guessed those places. I said they were big cities, but that answer wasn't enough for her (because ""there are other big cities""). So I said I just thought those cities had the most unique businesses. She started pressuring me for examples- I said I didn't have any, and she said that I should ""educate"" myself before ""making assumptions."" Like geez, it was just a guess about where a club was located? Then she said she was going to ""educate herself on the club,"" and she kept commenting on how I wasn't ""educating myself on things"" so I just said ""I don't care."" Then she said it was extremely problematic to say that and offensive to the LGBTQ+ community that I didn't care about this particular club. The most annoying part was whenever I hit her back with a logical argument, she would find ways to poke holes in it by changing her original statement- so for example, I said ""if I don't care about one particular pet store, that doesn't mean I don't care about pets."" And she changed her original argument from ""not caring about this club means you don't care about the LGBTQ+ community"" to ""not caring about this club means you don't care about the portion of the LGBTQ+ community that cares about this club."" And then she said it was offensive to compare the club to a pet store.

Is there a word to describe people like this? I'm honestly getting to the point where I can't stand it anymore. Anything I say needs to be questioned a million times. Sometimes there's no deeper reason to things. Guessing what state a random club is in isn't something that needs to be analyzed. And now I need to be afraid that every little thing I say is morally wrong. I'm kind of pissed that she says me not caring about the club (when in reality I didn't care about her comments anymore, but that's not the point) means I don't care about the LGBTQ+ community at all? Seriously? As if she has any authority over that anyway. I'm just getting fed up here...",11May2019,3
116,"Making a throwaway cause this is pretty embarrassing but...

So last Thursday I had 2 AP tests, Chem and psych, with chem being in the morning. As you can imagine, I was pretty stressed out, especially about chem. Possibly due to the stress, my body decided to release diarrhea (like I said embarrassing, at least it wasn't in my pants though) dump during the multiple choice during chem. As a result, I missed the last 10 or so questions. In addition to those 10 being wrong, I probably got at least 15 other questions wrong on the multiple choice, which wouldn't be a big deal if I didn't miss the last 10.

I don't think I compensated enough with the FRQ's (maybe a 30/50 if I'm lucky) and at this point, I'm seriously doubting on whether or not I'm passing the AP. I'm a decent student in that class, I just really don't want to disappoint my teacher or my parents with my AP grade.
