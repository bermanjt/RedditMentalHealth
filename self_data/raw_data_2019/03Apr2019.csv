0,"OK by nerd I mean a nerdy looking dude, like the Warden of Superjail (he is hot as hell to me). Let's say the nerd was so pissed at me he wanted to utterly destroy me and put me in a scissor hold to strangle me to death, but before this, I had the time to wipe tons of butter all over my neck. Would I be too slippery for him to strangle? Or would he just find it gross and choke me harder for making such a stupid decision? ",03Apr2019,2
2,"It’s my 25th wedding anniversary. I was 19 when I got married. There’s so many memories, highs, lows and lessons learned. We’re still in love, still attracted to each other and still miss each other when we’re apart. Can’t ask for more than that. Always remember that everything is temporary except for love. That shit stays with you. ",03Apr2019,10
3,"I’m starting to feel like myself again. I love to joke around, laugh, and smile a lot. 

Lately I’ve been feeling down about myself. I’ve been seeing myself as unworthy and I’ve been a complete mess. 

Yesterday I just let it all go. I still have some letting go to do but I really just did what I wanted to do and began to feel like myself again. 

Today I forgot about my “problems” and was in the moment. I haven’t felt so happy in a long time. My problems are not my problems, they are the past. 

I didn’t realize how good and fun of a day I was having until I felt how sore my cheeks are from smiling all day. It’s been so long. 

If someone is going through a tough time and feeling low, please push forward and be here now. Focus on what makes you happy and feel good. ",03Apr2019,3
4,"I was able to pay out of pocket for one month. My psychiatrist and I were hopeful of expediting an agreement with the insurance company, but we have had no such luck. I cannot afford it again this month.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been off my meds for a couple weeks now.

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot bring myself to study or do homework. I fell far, far behind in a relatively short amount of time. I was never prone to depression, but now I cannot stop thinking about suicide, day and night. I called my parents today to ask for help (not even money, although that would be nice; I just wanted someone to talk to), and they say, ""that's just what medication does to you. We saw this coming, and you denied it."" Well, no shit, that's just what medication does to you when you ***abruptly stop taking it***.

Time isn't real. I'll randomly fall asleep on my floor at 5 PM and wake at 2 AM. I'm lucky I still brush my teeth once a day, but I cannot remember the last time I showered.

5,"People often ask me how I've gotten so good at what I do in such a short amount of time.

As Michael Jordan once said, ""I've failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why I succeed""

That is the secret.

*The secret to success lies in the willing to fail.*

See I've put myself in countless situations where I had NO CLUE what I was doing and failure was pretty much inevitable.

But every time I got it ""wrong"" I was forced to consider how to get it right the next time.

And then I did.

My failures have taught me so much more than my successes ever will.

And I'll be honest - it's not fun to fail.

But every time we fail we're faced with a decision.

A decision to either run from our failure...or to LEARN from it.

Because failure is the BEST teacher there is.

And to avoid failure is to miss out on the PRICELESS lessons it has to teach us.

So you want to get REALLY good at something?

Fail.

Over and over and over again.

And that is why you will succeed.",03Apr2019,2
6,"I have really really been struggling. On and off most of my life, but I am 22 and this past 6 months has been my 2nd intense debilitating depression, first was age 14, was hospitalized and more. I have been pretty depressed my whole life, but these are something else.

I have at times such a strong inner critic that tells me I not human, I am evil, I am shit, everything. That i need a painful death. So many nights in the past half year, I am alone with a loaded shotgun in the woods and I honestly really want to do but I think of how it will destroy my family and I cant do it. I still am scared that I might though.

I am trying to find a way to enjoy living and not want to die. Its hard now, the past week and a bit, ive felt better than normal because i got a job, but still pretty bad.

The worse part is that i feel like now, i am constantly trying so hard to sleep enough  eat well, exercise and everything because i need to maximize how good i feel. If any bad event happends now, i am so unstable and poor coping mechanisms, i could go back to being in danger.

Her and I are really close, but I would never want to do something to her.

10,"I will follow the ""show, don't tell"" rule and give a brief example first. 

   Two days ago, I was in the supermarket with a sweet friend of mine, and while looking at stuff near the exit, we saw a VERY old lady arguing with the cashier. I think she was about 80, maybe even older, and she could barely talk, let alone carrying all that stuff she bought. After waiting to see if there was anybody to help her, we decided that I'd go help the lady carry the groceries and my friend would keep shopping and buy whatever else was on the list. Fast-forward, we're in front of her house, and she suddenly loses her balance, falling down to the ground. At this point, I should be panicking and helping her, but I felt nothing, done nothing and just stared casually at her for about 30 seconds. Then, seeing her efforts to get up, I helped her get up and didn't even ask if she was okay or not, I said absolutely nothing and just gave a smile afterwards. She thanked me, I said it was no problem and went back to the supermarket, feeling no remorse about it later on. I still don't, but I'm well aware that this was odd. This sort of stuff happens a lot, and I would appreciate your comments about it. 

   Also, when speaking to people that I like or respect, I will generally give overly detailed answers to things, describing my thoughts/feelings/information exactly and making a point near the end (for example, if I am describing a feeling, I would talk about what specifically made me feel this way, and what can be concluded by this), not missing any details whatsoever. In a casual/friendly setting, it often overwhelms people and makes them think I'm misinterpreting the subject and talking deeply about something casual, while it was just as casual for me. It's completely opposite with people I don't know and/or see likable, but that can change if I need to be good with that person for some reason (usually not for any sorts of manipulation, mind you). And I'm often emotinally drained by small-talk. 

Do you think these kinds of behaviour are problematic? Why? I would geniunely appreciate some thoughts.

Dropped them on the counter. T-shirt, jeans, bra, undies (granny panties lol), socks. Even some pretty expensive sneakers.

Smiled and said ""don't feel bad, the little nerd deserves it"" and left.

It is especially hard to make new friends in high school when you come from a faraway school. People are already arranged in their cliques, while I float, constantly day after day during lunch. I can't even hold a conversation for more than 2 minutes because I either get ignored or the person seems obviously bored. It just makes me sad because it makes me feel lesser than others. It's like my pre-existing friends don't even notice that I'm clearly bothered. Right now there are only a few people that would talk to me sincerely, but they get swept away by their respective cliques. I always find myself walking the halls trying to find someone to talk to which makes me feel lonely,miserable, and embaressed.

15,"Last few months have been exceptionally rough for me in terms of my social life.

It sounds silly considering that I’ve had people I’ve considered my friends for more than 10 years (some are more recent but they are a part of my group circle). 

But I really don’t have any common interests with any off them.
 Sure we like some of the same TV shows and movies. But so do me and my work colleagues. So it’s not something I’d consider as close bond.

The only time they talk to me is if they ask if I wanna go out for a drink and even then I feel like I’m just invited because I’m part of the group, not because they actually wanna hang out with me.

I’ve tried on numerous occasions to get a few of them involved in some of my hobbies. I like competitive PC gaming so I’ve tried getting them to play League of legends counterstrike, Rainbow six siege.  None of my friends play on PC I’ve explained that there are a lot of games that don’t require an expensive PC/Laptop  to be able play on.

I know I can’t force my hobbies on people. But I’m just trying to reach out. And have other conversation instead of the same stuff every other week.


Lastly i feel exactly the same with people I play with online. I have a group of friends who I used to hang out with irl but only really hang out on discord or we just bump into each other in my home town.

None of them wanna play games I suggest, and a lot of the time my messages get completely blanked. I posted about trying out Dota 2 and about an hour later no one acknowledged my message and 3 of them were talking about something else (the discord’s not big there’s like 4-5 active users on there.

Excuse my language but I’m just so fucking sick of being treated like a fucking plant in the corner.

I’d love it if my opinion gets taken on board for once or my friends do what I wanna do for once I’m tired of getting dragged around doing stuff I don’t wanna do.


I don’t wanna keep saying no to things though as that’s how people stop talking to you.",03Apr2019,2

21,"So I'm a barista. I left my old job a few weeks ago because of some unprofessionalism between the manager there and a co-worker that he liked. The manager wouldn't do his job anymore and would only schedule himself to work with that one person, everyone at work ended up getting frustrated, and I along with several other people left in the hopes of finding a better job. I work as a barista btw in a small shop, so it wasn't a big loss. Everyone of my co-workers that was working with me pretty much felt the same way.

I went to another local coffee shop after work (I was still working at my old job) and the manager was there. She told me that she was having trouble because a lot of people left on her and I told her that I was just leaving. we talked for a bit, I signed an application and I was hired on the spot; she didn't give me an interview. Her name is Sarah btw, 30 years old. I'm 24.

So far I've worked a total of 4 days at my new job... and I'm getting really self conscious on what I'm getting myself into. I just left my job because the manager and a co-worker couldn't keep their feelings from the workplace but I'm afraid I might get myself into the same situation.

I quickly got myself accustomed to the job; it was a pretty easy transition and because of my work ethic and personality I got along well with my new co-workers. Most of them had already known me as a regular there because I would go there to write and drink tea before I asked to work there. There isn't any bad feelings towards me that I feel and I feel very much welcomed.

Now Sarah, she and I hit it off very well. At my first day of training she was very professional but as the hours went by she and became less and less formal with each other. Our natural chemistry and vibrations clicked and we could tell we were comfortable around each other. The next day she told me how she was hungover from last night and how she had a horrible night, and we small talked for a long time. The third day I was restocking the drinks in the lobby and she was working on the receptionists table. I knew she was looking at me so I scratched my groin to try and get a reaction from her and she instantly looked at waist. Later on that day she was talking about how she was feeling stressed out lately and I gave her a back massage... so yeah things are definitely moving forward very quickly.

She and I are the same height. She's fucking gorgeous and looks my age. I'm pretty short for a guy and I have an athletic build. I've never been with someone who is 6 years older than me but with everything that's happening right now she and I are giving each other signs to no end that we want this to happen; we're flirty, we play around physically with each other, there was even this one time where a guy came for an interview. All of us working at the time gave this guy attention and me and Sarah constantly looked at each other (I think she caught on that I was getting jealous of this guy for talking to her for so long). After the guy had left she went and talked to me a bit playfully, just to reassure me that she still had feelings for me. 

But I'm afraid. I really do like this girl a lot but I just got the job. And coming from my old job and the reasons why I left there I can't help but feel that something is contradictory about me wanting to be with Sarah. At the same time though I know that the sexual tension is very much alive between us and it's only a matter of time before my new co-workers catch on to the feelings that the both of us have for each other.

She and I haven't actually said anything about our feelings for each other though; I think the both of us are afraid because of work. But the next time I work with her I plan on going further and kissing her, asking if we could go to a bar when we're not working together. A part of me feels like she's waiting for me to make a move on her.

I just... I don't know. I know this is a bad idea. But I really want to do this.

I guess what im trying to ask for is advice. Help me help myself.

Either way just msgd him that he better answer me or I'll drop the deal. Were my sources wrong or did he think he was imagining things when he received that message, thinking it was some old one from the past that was sent just now? Or could it be he is so disinterested that he literally doesn't even bother answering me? That's rude, I hope it's not the case. If it is then it will be a good motivation for myself to become the best successful version of myself. We will see...

24,"Hi everyone - I'm in a tough spot. I'm moving out of my apartment in a few months to live with some new people, and I'm worried because my current roommate and I have lived together for a few years, are very close, and I know she's going to have a hard time adjusting to living with new people once I'm gone. We're good friends and I love her to death, but I think being good friends doesn't make you good roommates. We've just gotten so used to living together, and I'm really concerned that it's going to be very hard for her to know and adjust to the fact that I'm leaving, or that it'll ruin our friendship. I don't want that at all. I just need a change in my lifestyle, but I don't know that she'll see it that way. I think she'll take it very personally. I'm so afraid of her reaction that I haven't been able to sit down and tell her my plans yet. I don't handle conflict well at all.

The way we live together is not an ideal situation for me right now, and it's sometimes even very stressful and emotionally exhausting. We're similar in our interests but very different people. But even though I'm not happy here and I know that, I can't shake this feeling that I'm abandoning my current roommate, that I'm being selfish by pursuing something that will be really beneficial to me mentally - and I can't shake this feeling that it makes me a bad person for doing something that I need to do, because it'll put someone I care about in a more uncomfortable (but completely liveable) situation. I struggle with OCD and anxiety so thinking about all this constantly has completely taken over my life and is really damaging my mental health.

When do you find that doing something that you need to do for yourself is more important than making sure someone else will be okay once you've made your decision? Am I making a mistake or being an asshole by thinking of myself in this situation? I can't get over this guilt that I'll be hurting her by moving forward. ",03Apr2019,2

For the past two years my dad has been in Afghanistan (military) and I used to think that a lot of the problems in my home were caused by my father.  The past two years have been incredibly self challenging in the fact that my mother blackmails me often to my family. She tells my older brothers how disrespectful I am, how I never help around the house and basically am a slouch. I actually run a business full-time and take a couple night classes. I do promise I help around the house DAILY. Besides shaming my character to other family members who view me almost below them now. My mom always verbally abuses me saying I’m not normal for wanting to play video games when I get home from work. She tries to regulate everything I do and I can’t stand it. I do my best to always work outside of the house to get away from her but night time I always dread the most. From my understanding most older teens/people in their 20’s have the ability to decide when they want to go to bed. I always go to bed around 12 and read 30minutes before bed.  Today she was upset and wanted me to go to bed at 11 and I tried to explain that I just want to stay up for a bit longer because I have worked all day and want to enjoy myself. Not to mention 11 is quite early. So, today she threw my tv on the ground breaking it. One of the few activities I like to do after work and she destroyed my tv. I didn’t say anything I just got up and walked away. (If you’re wondering yes I 100% WANTED to punch a hole in the wall because that shit blows)

35,"Most people who dont really get to know me, or even sometimes people who are close to me, think im mean because of my expressions/ ticks and things. 

Let me explain: for one, i always open my eyes real wide, my eyelashes touch my eyebrows and it’s uncomfortable so i do that (and look up too for some reason) and i had no idea everyone thought i was just ROLLING MY EYES!!!!! This started when i was in the 8th grade, I’m 19 now. 

When i was in cheer camp, one morning my coach came in and yelled at all of us because apparently someone had attitude and she said ‘and the rolling of the eyes needs to stop’ but like actually really mad and it was a big deal and i had no idea who she was talking about!!!!! only 2 years later my friend told me it was about me, i felt so awful and everyone just thought im a brat but there was nothing i could do to convince anyone at this point :(

A second, i started to hear word from my sister that  her friend’s older sister, who is in my grade, said “yeah your sister (me) hates me for no reason” i was like ???? ok whatever that’s not true, i have NEVER said or honestly really ever thought anything about this girl. to set the scene, this girl is a part of a small friend group of girls who are the more awkward type who dont really talk to anyone outside themselves. then i heard another rumor i took pictures of another girl in this lil group, a girl on the nerdier side with sort of big poofy hair. i never said anything about this girl ever. they said i took a picture of this girl and put it on my snapchat story and said something about having an afro ????? (this girl is white and doesn’t actually have an afro, it was meant to be insulting i guess?) that girl was on my bus to and from school and lived near me and i think they said i took it from the bus or something.

obviously i wanted to tell her i did NOT do that, and once on the way home from school she was sitting alone and i was like hey can i sit here for a sec? and i said hey, i heard something about me posting a picture of you in my story, and i just want to let you know that that’s a total fabrication and i’m really sorry if someone DID do that to you but it really was not me. and she was like oh yeah someone said you did that, didn’t really say much else.

another girl a part of this friend group is “CAITLYN”. i went to elementary school with this girl, and she is 2 houses down from my best friend since kindergarten. Caitlyn was honestly always super weird, just didn’t fit in with us, but we were always nice to her and included her in sleepovers and the hannah montana movie premier n whatnot. Ive realized now she has aspbergers.

10th grade, my friend who happens to be Caitlyn’s cousin, tells me Caitlyn says she wont come to an event at the school because my best friend bullied her. My friend heard this from Caitlyn’s mom, her aunt.

12th grade and i have the first 4 classes with her and 4 other kids. She was always super cold and avoided eye contact but i was always nice to her. 

End of the year we go to costa rica for a field trip and she turns 18, i was rooming with her and 2 other girls.

39,"This is my first ever reddit post, but I’ve been lurking for a while.  I don’t really know where to post this so please let me know.

Tonight something sucky happened. 

I was coming home from hanging out with some friends and a cop who had only recently gotten behind me pulled me over. I didn’t know why because I couldn’t think of what I had done wrong in the short time that he was following me. I pulled over and he came to my car and said he did so because I ran a stop sign. Now I know my city very well, and I would never run a stop sign on purpose. If there was a stop sign I didn’t see it, and I apologized to the man. Then he told me that my car smelled like marijuana and you know how it goes from there...... 
He “only” charged me for possession. 

I guess what I want to know is: what should I do? My dad is suuuuuper pissed, as you can imagine. I don’t want to go into too many details in case it would bore you guys.  It’s my first offense though.  Any feedback would be much appreciated!",03Apr2019,3
40,"So, I found myself in this scenario yet again.. Yes, something similar to this has happened to me many times. If you're bored and want to hear about a shit show, go ahead, otherwise skip to the bottom lol.

I saw this guy (18M) who I met off Tinder for about a month and a half. I met him not with the intention of having sex right away, just to hang out and smoke some weed. Well, of course he put the moves on me &amp; I gave in because I was really bad at saying no to sex! He seemed nice enough, and I thought he was nicer than the last guy I hooked up with. Oh boy, was I wrong. We continued to have sex at least once a week, and he convinced me not to use a condom (stupid me). I loved that he never flaked out on me &amp; that he shared his weed with me.. &amp; I know some of y'all will think the age difference is weird, but I thought he was adorable.   He met my coworker once &amp; we all smoked weed together, &amp; she thought he was cool &amp; didn't look like he was too young for me. Something felt off, though. He would dip as soon as he got off, and he came too quickly. He didn't even attempt to last long enough to get me off. I thought it was b/c of his age &amp; inexperience, but it was actually b/c he was using me!

We had sex 7 times total, and made a sex tape together. I felt something was off after the 7th time we hooked up, so I looked him up on Insta &amp; saw it had a girl's name with a heart next to it in the bio. It was very suspicious, so I recorded all of our snap conversation just in case he had a gf &amp; was cheating. I didn't like how he didn't take much initiative in hitting me up, but I was stupidly into him so I did hit him up anyways. Last time I hit him up, he said he wanted to hook up but was in his hometown on spring break. THEN he asked me to unsave our conversation so he could say whatever he wanted. That was so suspicious, so I asked why.. he said it was b/c he didn't want anyone to see us talking about drugs. So I went ahead &amp; asked, ""do you have a gf?"" And he said, ""no, but I might soon. so I'll be more comfortable if you don't save the conversation."" I told him, ""I enjoyed this, but we shouldn't see each other anymore."" He said, ""me too :/"" It sucked. I irrationally developed a crush on him, and just like that, it was over.

So this shit has happened to me so many times. I meet a guy, and he ditches me for another girl.. or he had a gf the whole time. I was uncertain which it was. I thought he found a new girl &amp; was leaving me, maybe. So I said, ""yeah, except for the fact you were always ready to dip as soon as you came. Why do guys always just fuck me and leave me for someone else like I'm good luck Chuck?"" All he said was, ""well damn,"" then he deleted me like I was nothing to him.

Looked him up on Twitter &amp; easily found his gf's Twitter, then from that found her Insta. Looks like they've been together. Her profile pic AND background pic were of them together. She was the kinda chick who posted angry tweets filled with poor grammar and cuss words all the time; it was either that or about smoking weed or juuling.  On her Insta, she had his name with a heart next to it in her bio. I messaged her and told her what happened between me &amp; her bf.. She didn't see it until weeks later.

So yesterday, she asked for screenshots. I sent the video. She asked how this happened, and I told her. She asked what his back looked like, and I said he had bacne. Then she asked if I was a student at his school &amp; said no. So she asked, ""so why fuck an 18 yo?"" &amp; kept telling me how old I looked, how I was so much older than him. &amp; well, that's not what her bf told me. I'm obviously older than them b/c I graduated college &amp; have a degree, &amp; post pix of living my life as a career woman rather than as a student. I told her I didn't want to engage further if she was gonna be rude, and she asked for the sex tape (which of course I wouldn't give her).

After that, I looked at both their Insta's and neither of them have each other's names in their bios anymore. She must have went off on him. She retweeted some tweet about deleting a post saying that they were dating their favorite person. I recently got tested just to be safe.

TLDR; I am tired of finding myself in this scenario. It's happened with multiple different guys I've hooked up with, and two guys I didn't hook up with but who tried to hook up with me. 3 of the guys I met from night clubs and 2 were from tinder.. Yeah, figures. I've had a poor judge of character &amp; have wasted a lot of time on shit heads. Yes, I was just hooking up, but I didn't want to help anybody cheat. Whenever I catch someone cheating, I expose them. So I decided the hookup life isn't for me b/c I'm not okay with the possibility of hooking up with cheaters. I want to get some background info on the guys I hook up with from now on.. ",03Apr2019,1

51,"So for context: I'm 24, female with a long term boyfriend of five years. My colleague is 41, married with two kids and another on the way. 

So at a colleagues leaving party, a co-worker I consider a friend out of the blue drunkenly propositioned me. The issue is is that I have no doubt he meant it, and that it wasn't just because he was drunk. He's wreckless and impulsive and kept telling me he'd have no problem with the moral aspect of cheating on his wife. He kept asking to kiss me and I kept having to tell him we can't do that. 

He kept asking for the rest of the night until I left (as soon as it happened I messaged my boyfriend to come pick me up, but it was still about 30 minutes because of traffic).

He's married with two kids and a third on the way, and has a reputation for being really nice and helpful and fun. He has been there for me when I've had a really difficult time with mental health, but when he was drunk he even admitted that he was thinking about how sexy I was when he was hugging me to help me calm down from a panic attack (a very vulnerable time where I was having a dissociative episode and several panic attacks and suicidal thoughts).

He kept talking about how he thought it was really hot that I did ice skating. But I don't ice skate, I roller skate, avidly, weekly, I even have a tattoo of a roller skate, and I talk about it a lot how he got the two mixed up, I don't know. It made me realise he hasn't been spending time with me as a friend at all because he doesn't even know some of the more basic things about me.

He spent the remainder of the time I was there touching me, not in a sexual manner, just in an overly friendly way. I was drunk too and didn't handle it well because I was scared of his reaction, and stupidly of hurting his feelings.

I said he was attractive (he is) and if we were single and didn't work together then I'd maybe consider it, but that ultimately he knows this could never ever happen between us, because it would never end well. 

Unfortunately I think that all he took from that was that I said he was attractive and I don't know if he now thinks its a possibility, when I was describing an alterative universe in which he doesn't have kids and isn't double my age and married. We kind of hugged it out (which I also wish I hadn't done, in retrospect) and I tried to explain that it can't happen but I don't think he was listening. 

I think he must have known it wasn't great because I hid in the toilets for 20 minutes after I managed to peel him off of me. My other friend was texting me to check I was okay and I went and waited for my ride outside with him. I told him what happened and he thought it was pretty gross of him.

I told my partner and he also said it wasn't really my fault but I feel guilty for not immediately shutting it down. I feel bad for trying to be kind and polite and to try and stop it from being weird but now it's weirder.

Whats worse is he's now messaging me asking about how work is going and how I am and if I'm in the office or working from home.

I don't know if he's trying to pretend it didn't happen, or if he's just waiting for his next chance to make another move. I felt so guilty for just even remotely humouring him long enough to leave, how can he not feel guilty for his poor wife who is heavily pregnant?!

What do I do? I'm going to have to engage with him soon, but at the moment because I haven't actually seen him in the office I haven't answered his messages.

Telling my boss is out of the question, they've been best friends for 15+ years and she'll definitely believe him over me if he tried to make it seem like I iniated it. Do I try and talk to him again and make it clear we can't have this conversation again. Am I right to feel like I was being used this whole time and that the friendship I valued meant nothing to him?

I've since heard rumours he's had affairs before. (no one believed the rumours because he's 'too nice')

Do I need to be worried about being alone with him, should I avoid future work outings in case he tries this again? Do I confront him or let him act like it didn't happen? Do I ignore him now except for work stuff. ",03Apr2019,5
52,"Hey Reddit. I’m currently writing this from a hostel garden while my friend is having sex in our hostel dorm. We are currently traveling together.

But I’m writing this because I need to vent my yearlong frustration. Reddit I suck so so much with girls. I’ve been trying to come up with excuses for years, I’ve tried to hide it and I’ve lied my way into making people think I’m some sort of Hank Moody style player/girl whisperer. People even buy it...

But at this very moment I’m so close to smashing in my friend’s head with whatever I can find. EXCEPT I won’t. Because I know that I am extremely, extremely frustrated at myself.

Reddit, I have not have sex yet in 2 years... I’m 27 years old. I’m supposed to be in the ‘prime of my life’ but honestly it has been a massive disaster. Reddit it’s been horrendous.

I cannot begin to explain how bad I am with girls. I REPEL them. I don’t get them attracted to me, I repel them. Maybe the first 10 minutes they think I am somewhat attractive or insteresting, but then they always drop off. I cannot close, let alone have proper conversation.

—-

My friend just came to see me in the garden. He stopped having sex because he knows I’m uncomfortable. So now I feel I cockblocked him. I honestly don’t know how I feel about it. On the one hand I feel really bad, because I don’t want to be that kind of a friend, the buzzkiller.  But on the other hand I am quite happy and relieved, because if he would get laid another time on this trip I think I would start a depression.

—-

Continuing again from my hostel room. My friend is laying in bed with the girl, they are (at the moment) not having sex (yet). Though I think he’s probably fingering her based on the sounds. 

Reddit, I don’t know what to do anymore. I am screaming for help here. I don’t want to live my life like this, but it is happening. I’ve looked for help, but to no avail.

—- I think they are starting to have sex again —-

What. The. Fuck. Happened to my life. How is this even possible. I am now sleeping in a hostel room where there’s a couple having sex. Oh and do you want to know the best part? This whole thing is costing me 900 euros. Yeah, let me tell you that.

So I am currently traveling

—- they are definitely having sex now —-

And today we were supposed to fly back home. We met 2 girls on the plane who were traveling as well but our plane was massively delayed. We ended up hanging out with them. Long story short, we decided to miss our flight so we could hang out with the girls. We had some good vibes going and I definitely though I had a chance with one of them.

So we decided to not do our return flight, but book a new one (for 900 f*cking euro) so we could spend the night hanging out with the girls. Do you know what happened next? My friend is banging one of them in our room. I think the second one left and I am here, 900 euros lighter and stuck in a f*cking hostel dorm where my friend is now for sure having sex in the bed next to me.

— now writing from the communal room because they closed the garden. The door didn’t close very well and they are now audible through the whole hostel—-

—- Plot twist. I tried to hide in the kitchen. Turns out they were actually having sex there. I now JUST ran into them whilst having sex. WTF —-

I think I’m having a nervous breakdown. I’m shaking and trembling all over.

I...

Reddit, I’m screaming for help. I don’t know what to do. I’m desperate to talk to someone about this. I need to vent.

I’m not doing well. Please help.

Is this gonna fine? What do I do?

It’s all over. I’m gonna hear this story for years. It’s gonna echo in my head. I paid f*cking 900 euros to have my friend have sex right next to me while I haven’t gotten laid in 2 years.

I am living through my worst nightmare. 

This is not good. I feel really really bad. Help.

I don’t want to be a player. I don’t have to sleep with a different woman every week. I only want a nice girl that loves me back.

I’m done with lying and pretending. Reddit WHAT THE FUCK is happening here. I’m writing from a dark hostel kitchen because my friend is having sex in the dorm.

I just took a cigarette. I don’t smoke.

What did I ever do to deserve this?? I’m always respectful towards women. I’ve never #metoo’d any of them. I’ve helped some out of very tough situations and all I ever got was a thank you. I just want to feel loved and romantically wanted by someone.

And this is what I get? I’m on a holiday, I’m supposed to have fun. This is the worst I’ve ever felt. I need to go back to work tomorrow. I don’t know how that’ll go. 

What an absolutely mess I am in right now.

Fuck my life.

Please.

57,"I’m in college and I am a horrible procrastinator. I write almost every essay the night before. I also hold myself to an extremely high standard and have never gotten below a B, so I think that’s why I still do this even though it’s my 4th semester and I should know better by now. I have an essay due tomorrow and surprise, I started it tonight. It’s a fairly simple essay but the planning and research took me longer than expected, and my procrastination further delayed the process. It is now 4 a.m., I have drank an entire Redline energy drink over the course of the night, I have less than 1 page written out of 6, and my brain and body are shutting down. Each sentence takes so much effort to write because it’s so hard to think about it and I have been feeling nauseous for the past few hours. Not to mention, I have anxiety and caffeine really makes my heart beat faster than comfortable hahaha. As I write this, no one else is awake and I just feel sort of hopeless. I have two options: write the damn thing and not get any sleep or try to sleep and take the L of turning it in late. If I turn it in late, there is a 3 point reduction per day. That isn’t too bad but this particular professor is a tough grader and I have a feeling this won’t be my best work. However, with the extra time I could work to improve. Additionally, I have not made below a B on an assignment in this class yet (I’ve made one A and one B). An even bigger however, though, is that I have a first draft of a longer research paper due on Friday that I also haven’t started. Taking an extra day on this will delay my progress on that. I have been so overwhelmed these past few weeks with school and I think it’s a combination of my procrastination and my high-standards because I can’t half-ass anything. Anyways. Does anyone have any advice on what I should do? Should I rest and take a reduction or just try my best to get it done tonight? Thanks for listening.

80,"My dad is probably the best, hard working and most honest man I know in my life. He grew up in an abusive childhood until he left for the Canadian army. But until that day came, he was like the “chad” of high school, did wrestling, football, track and field. He got athletic awards, and whole bunch of stuff like that. He left his home at the age of 17 to join the Canadian armed forces during the Cold War (1978). He stayed there for 3 years as infantry and all throughout his years he was offered special roles and officer ranks and was asked to stay longer when his time was up, hell, they even pulled him out of a airborne course to put him in a leadership course because they wanted him to be an officer. He was in a bunch of NATO exercise, his most memorable one was the one he was sent to Norway to be the front lines troops. 

When he was done with the military, he become an police officer but before that, he got a motorcycle and travelled across Canada and America. So in maybe 1980, he joined the police academy and become a police officer. He did amazing stuff for the community, he did 15 years provincial policing (which is about the equivalent of state trooper but they operate in towns as well). He also did 15 years in my town. He been mentioned in several newspapers for stuff he did, he even helped out the American border city one or two times over some special cases. He did so much for the community and for the police force. 

He did firearm teaching, was the leader of special entry kind of thing (sort of like swat but for local police force, can’t remember the actual name) he did search and rescue. He even went scuba diving, several times with a team to find bodies in the river. He did so many amazing things, it would impossible to list them here but there are two stories always stood out to me. I’ll make them really short. 

There was a break and entering robbery going on in a small convenience store. My dad got the call but he didn’t have to respond because he was not in the area but he took up with it. So the standard procedure was to have back up since only the alarms alert the neighbours so it was unknown how many and how armed they were. But my dad rushed in, gun drawn on the guy, it turns out it was a young teenager with an axe to break and enter. My dad told him to drop the axe or he’ll be forced to shot him. He fucking make the kid pissed himself. When my dad looks back at that night, he feels bad for scaring him like that but it was necessary. Funny enough though, the CCTV that recorded the whole thing, they used it in the police academy because he rushed in without back up and without checking the rest of the store. 

The one other one, and many other similar ones where he would deal with hell angels or aboriginals, he would deal with them differently. He wouldn’t try to get into a fight or insult them. He would often stand there and wait them out and give them sly remarks. One would asked “what the hell you looking at” and he would respond “nothing” and he told me when I was older, “I said nothing because to me, he’s nothing, just an asshole”. My dad would try have respect and connect with the people he arrested in the back of his car. He once asked if some crackhead would like McDonald’s before taking him in. The same hell angels guy I mentions earlier, he was spitting and insulting my dad when he was cuffed and bought to the car but during the ride to the station, the man apologized and asked if he could have a smoke before being sent in. My dad let him have his smoke and continued to treat him with respect until he was put away. 

Nearing the end of my dad’s police career, he signed up to some really light light undercover at the local casino to clamp down on drugs and illegal gambling. When my dad told the staff sergeant he was interested in signing up. The staff sergeant audibly shouted out “fuck! Now I gotta split your cases and assignments between 3 sergeants!”. My dad was truly a one man army to the point where his cases was given away to three sergeants. Like all of this feels so fake because it’s insane on how much he did for everyone but it’s all real and it blows my mind. 

The only times he would go off the police guidelines is with domestic violence calls, my dad has no pity or empathy for husbands would beat and abuse their girlfriends and wives. He would just kick the doors down and just take care of the asshole who think it’s okay be abusive, he made sure they get a good beating. This goes back to his childhood, growing up two
Other brothers, a dad who’s a cop and a mum who was a stay at home. His two brothers got into fights with the abusive dad as they got older but wasn’t able to “win”. The sad part is when my dad came home to visit his mum half way through his military service, he came home to the screams of his mum getting beaten. He would tell me that it was the last time his father would ever hurt his mum. My dad swore that when he become a police officer, he would anything to ensure domestic violence survivors would be safe and teach the assholes a lesson. 

He’s been retired for a few years now, 6 or 5 years now and he’s still working, got three jobs, he’s gonna keep working till he’s 60. In the past 2 years, his life begin to change. He learned that he wasn’t the son of the abusive father he grew up with, that he has an another technical brother, he only learned this because when his older brother was dying in the hospice, he told him that he might not actually be his full blood brother. Then last year he got split up with his wife, because she found another man. And my dad been going to therapy because he and others think he has some mild PTSD from his childhood and his policing years. But Everyday he wakes up, takes me and my sister to high school, goes to work, go work out and he’s involved with the local legion marching band as a bass drummer. He could have been a very different person, he coulda been his father and be abusive, he coulda Been a bum for being dumped but he’s not. He doesn’t deserve this but he’s a soldier, he always said “the stuff you learn as a child and in the army, will stay with you for the rest of you life” so yeah. 


And all of those stories, pictures, awards from higher ups in the police force, recognition from
The major, he’s just my dad, to anyone else, he would be seen as a badass and I get that a lot. And I don’t know how to show that I appreciate the 33 years he gave to protect the people of Canada. He’s truly a good man and I don’t know how I could ever live up to my dads legacy in a sense. A lot of people know him and a lot of people know me. And I want to show m

83,"It is weird. I feel scared and anxious in silence, so I've been indulging in TV shows. I can't focus on a job search, learning things for my career or hobbies, and my mind is filled with thoughts about HIM. We dated for over a month and now this thing is fading. I initiated conversations, offered to meet up, I thought he liked me too, but now I think I was just feeding his ego. It's sad because I rarely meet anyone I like, and now I am really careful at first. I know how to let this all go, but deep in my brain I still keep thinking, that maybe he's too shy, or too depressed during these past few weeks (he has mental issues), so I should give him more excuses and just wait until he missed me. But all I see are the red flags. Red flags everywhere. I want to give the benefit of the doubt and I keep waiting to hear from him - because I am tired of texting first. I still want to send little nothings and talk, but I don't think I should. I want to be wanted, missed, I want him to be excited to see me, not pushing myself into his company, even if I crave it more than my usual coffee in the morning. 

He's always on my mind. It's not even serious, but I don't know how to get him out and go back to being my old happy self that used to do things! 

I was at peace only in the morning, while I was cleaning around my flat. The day was just starting so there's plenty of time to hear from him. But now it's 4 pm and it looks like it's another day of silence. All days are just like this now. I keep thinking what is he doing and how much I want to do everything with him. I feel pain when I think of all the things he chooses to do without me. I have just moved from far away and don't have that many people around me, so I value each and every one. 

Can't handle this silence... I used to love silence. Now it's driving me crazy. Whatever I do, he's on my mind. I wake up at 4 and then worry. I was so peaceful before. 

I have this text message ready to send and just close this chapter. I hate being in this limbo situation. Overthinking, analyzing, worrying that maybe it's my imperfections that are driving men away, but on the other hand I believe I am a great woman. But maybe I am just fooling myself? Maybe I have something that drives men I like away and I have no idea what that is. Or maybe the world has changed so much that everyone needs weeks or months of space between the interactions and I am just pushing way too much. But no. Wanting to see my date at least once a week should be a normal thing... This is just sad. ",03Apr2019,1
84," 

So recently my GF had some traumatic things happen to her. I didn't respond the correct way I should have to the issue and we wound up ending it. However, the next day when we met up to exchange some things we basically said how we still loved each other more than anything. We agreed to remain together but take a break from physically seeing each other so she can deal with these issues and better herself from it.

She did say we can talk, even on a daily basis. So this was a rule differing from anything I've seen on other posts. I have figured out most of the issues dwelled from me only dwelling on negativity not positity. I told her how I want to be there for her and support her through it all and she genuinely seems to understand that. But she she said she does want space to seek counseling and better herself so we can eventually start dating again. I know I have changed her life for the better and we have bonded and experienced so much more than any of our past relationships, especially on her part! She still says when we message each other she loves me , and loves me more than anything.

I miss her so badly and know she is the one that I would want to spend my life with. I want to know how to get her back into my life and rekindle what we had but make it better. My mom believes she will come around eventually. Has anyone had anything similar play out and work out? Or what should I be doing?

Until then, I was able to have confidence in and believe positive things about myself--that I was a chill, smart, ambitious, attractive girl. I felt (relatively) confident around guys and about the fact that I was a person people could be friends with. 

&amp;#x200B;

A short history of me: Let me just say, that if I write a list about myself, on paper, I sound not so bad. I loved my undergraduate degree (graduated in '16) and am very passionate about my studies, and did a major research project with fieldwork I did myself for several months in Asia (and won several thousand dollars to do it). I graduated, got a great internship in my field of interest for a year, started dating a guy (we are still together). Then I was unemployed for about a year (last year) and I went through a lot of my savings during this time and had a hard time getting a job (around the time these feelings intensified), decided I needed out for a while, went to Asia for a few months to solo travel (didn't enjoy it and now feel embarrassed), now I'm in Spain for several months taking language classes and doing an internship. In the Fall I start a Masters in Anthropology at Oxford. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really at a loss at how to improve my attitude other than ""positive self talk."" I compare myself to my older boyfriend, who has two masters degrees and speaks three languages and has a great job (I have none of those things). All my friends have ""real"" (aka professional) jobs, and I'm just spending my savings to do random things. I feel like I'm a mess. I avoid social situations and feel extremely uncomfortable and anxious talking to people. I am insecure, I don't feel attractive at all, I don't see why anyone would want to be friends with me, and I don't have any idea what my boyfriend, who loves me very much, sees in me--at all (not that I would ever tell him that, though he does know I'm insecure). I truly believe I wouldn't find anyone else again if we weren't together and am therefore painfully insecure about our relationship, which is terrible. Compliments and recognition of my own achievements go right above my head. I know this is a lot of negative self talk and I would never say these things to a friend, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really miss my confidence. I push myself to do things, but don't feel any sense of accomplishment after. Solo trips used to make me feel great, now I just avoid people and feel like I'm wasting money, even though I love to travel. I'm anxious to learn Spanish, but all I feel is sad and frustrated that I'm not improving fast enough. 

I go to therapy and am on anti-anxiety meds, but I feel at a loss. I feel a little better when I exercise regularly, but I have a hard time not being obsessive about it and it only helps to a certain extent. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I don't understand is, how the hell can this big of a change happen?  I desperately don't want to feel this way. All I can think about is what goal to achieve next, thinking it will make me feel good about myself, then I achieve it, and I don't feel any different (obviously). Can anyone relate, or share what has helped them?",03Apr2019,2
95,"cw for sexual assault, abuse, and just some really sad fucked up shit

Hey guys. This is my first post in a while so let me give you some backstory.

I'm 19, female, bi, and in what I consider to be a really great relationship. Before I started dating my current boyfriend, we'll call him K, I was dating a girl named D for three whole ass years, from 15-18. We started dating in my freshman year of high school and broke up last year.

I'll try to keep this short. Basically, the problem is, D abused me very badly during our relationship. She raped me over the course of our relationship several times. She would get me high in exchange for sex, and when I tried to say no she fucked me anyway. In addition to this, growing up my dad used to beat me and my mom would just stand there and watch. The only things I remember from my childhood are screaming, seeing red, begging, and just feeling so fucking angry and sad. When I was 16 I was diagnosed with major depression, PTSD, panic disorder (which later became GAD), and had early signs of schizophrenia. I've been in therapy since I was 13. I'm trying to get better. I take my meds every day. I'm converting to Buddhism, I practice ahimsa (nonviolence).

Recently, I have been notified of the act that D goes around and tells people that she was not only the VICTIM in our relationship, but that I abused and manipulated her.

Here's where things get complicated.

My current bf, K, has a brother named W. W is acquaintances with D and her group of friends. This is how I found out that D and her friends talk shit about me constantly and have basically blackballed me. 

I confronted W about this. Obviously, I am very sick so I can't really control my emotions like someone without an emotional disability, but I do try really hard. I told him that he really upset me and that I wish he hadn't have said it. He proceeded to tell me that it was my fault for asking, which I guess is true. But honestly? I'm probably schizophrenic (I have been diagnosed with psychosis), and one of my long standing delusions is that others are out to ""get"" me, hurt me, poison me, or otherwise tear me down.

That's the real reason why I asked W if they ever talked about me. 

I don't think he understands this.

He made me have a panic attack, then I had to call off of work because of it, and then even after I told him that D had raped me, he said he didn't care. I told him he should care! If the situation were reversed, I would have been so upset on his behalf. I would never have spoken to the assailant again and would have apologized immediately. This makes me very scared. I'm very afraid that I have too much empathy and that it's going to get me killed.

Essentially, I don't know what to do. I'm scared and I can't eat and I just want people to know the truth. Thank you for reading.

We're both doing ok with the break up, I think.  Using the separation to improve ourselves, I'll admit I wasn't the best boyfriend. I was very loving and caring but I wasn't accomplished enough in my personal life to keep up with her. She deserves someone who actually wants to go out on hikes and thinks flowers are interesting. I get that, I respect what happened and I just hope I can improve myself to the point where she would consider getting back together.

That being said, at least once I week I have a some variation of a bad dream where she clearly doesn't love me anymore and it feels like going through the most painful breakup of my life all over again.

103,"So around a month ago a girl I knew from a couple years ago came back into my life. We both used to have feelings for each other but the situation wasn’t the best and we were both in different parts of our life etc. Now, two years or more later, we start talking again. We were both flirting back and fourth and I thought everything was going good, and so I asked her out. Her response was “You’re a great person Ray but I was in a relationship for the past two years and I forgot how nice it feels to be free etc. and I don’t want a relationship w/anyone right now, I just don’t want to be locked down.” Fast forward to the next day and she ends up hooking up with one of my friends and they’re now dating. So I was crushed, my “dream girl” of the past just crushed any dreams of us that I had, and simultaneously made me insecure and have no trust in her. 

Fast forward a week or so me and this other girl start talking, and she’s really into me. Like genuinely, says she’s all for me and wants me to ask her out when she gets back from vacation. We talked and called each other every night and hung out every couple of days. This weekend something changed, and she’s barely talked to me since and doesn’t wanna hang out. At that point my anxiety kicks in, I start to overthink and worry about her/us in general. Yesterday she was hanging out with her ex, with the girl that friend zoned me earlier and her friend. I was fine with it, whatever right? Well I message her to tell her how I feel about how she’s getting distant and how I feel she’s putting in no effort recently and she says “i’m just going through a rough time and need to go through this by myself, if i need your help i’ll ask.” Next thing I know I get sent a snap, and it was her laying on her ex’s lap. I messaged her asking her if she’s with her ex and she says “No I’m home” and leaves it at that, I ask her how her nights going and she says well and keeps being vague and doesn’t reply after a couple texts back and fourth. I say fuck it and trust her, just thinking the girl on her ex’s lap was someone else. Today, I message her good morning and all that stuff, she ignored me. I messaged her again about an hour ago and i get a snap from her ex of him and her kissing. 

At this point, Im just done with her bullshit and remove her off everything, Im furious, she lead me on for weeks and lied to me throughout how much of it? I was constantly there for her trying my best to make her feel happy and loved, not talking to anyone else or even hanging out with anyone and what do I get for it? Used, and thrown out after she feels better. Why can’t I find someone who actually cares about me or wants to be with me? I try the hardest I can in all of my relationships, friends or s/o. I keep putting my all into making others feel better and what do I get for it? Twice in a month though, that’s a new record. I have no trust or confidence in myself whatsoever now, and I feel absolutely crushed. Do I just isolate myself, or keep going out and getting hurt. I don’t know what to do. I just needed to get this off my chest. ",03Apr2019,2

108,"I don't live in the US or anywhere in the west,  and I one day want to go to the west. I am 20 years old,  and as of late,  my interest in girls have been around the age range of 15-16. Whenever I look at girls around my age,  I feel zero attraction. 

Girls of my age,  in this case 20 or even 18, look like they're 30. They look...  Older than me..  And I say this because my height is 5""7 and a half, and all these girls look like they are in their 30s and are taller than me.  I haven't been to the west yet,  but I've already been to the UK once and I've already seen almost all girls around my age group are taller than me. 

Whereas for some reason I feel more relatable to high school girls.  16 is technically the legal age if consent,  so dating then would be fine,  yet knowing today's society,  there's a lot of Shaming when it comes to the age difference. 

High school girls are more..  Girly..  But college girls seem to be really different.  They look like they are older and they are even taller than me. Like I said,  I'm only 5""7 and a half. Plus,  all college girls do is focus on their studies (naturally,  they have lots to study).  So I don't even know whether they want to get into a relationship or not

I am confused.  I'll be going to the west in a few years from now,  but I'm afraid I'll be ""too old"" By then,  considering that I'll be 23 - 25 years old by then. And I get the feeling that at that age group,  girls will only be focused on their studies and jobs. 

High school girls are different.  They are so relatable and go out for foods and hanging out. They have so much time to spend. 

I wish I was born a few years later or at least I wish I had gone to the west much sooner because I'm not feeling it at all with girls of my age group. I feel ZERO attraction and I'm worried that by the time I'm 25, it will be too late. I wish I got a gf when I was 19/18 but now I feel I'm getting older and older. 

Just wanted to let my feelings out.  People say ""date someone your own age"" But im just not feeling anything with girls of my age. 

I haven't been to the west yet except the UK.  I need your guys' inputs. Because I am super confused

Another thing I forgot to mention is college girls in my country are conpletlet busy with studies and have zero interest in starting a relationship ship.  This is why I'm afraid that I'll never get a gf because the older the girls get,  the less interested they are. 

I don't know how this will be like in the west,  but probably the same. I have friends online who are 15-16 and they seem much more relatable.  I would still like some input. 

Ps.  The girls in my college are shorter than  me.  But in the west, girls around my age are all taller than me.  I'm only 5"" 7 and a half

I came across a character who both looks and acts like me to the point it is scary and for whatever reason this made me angry at both myself and the character. For example I wanted to invent something (not for money, but strictly to help people) but got belittled and laughed at for my ideas. In the show the character invents lots of things too. The physical resemblance is uncanny and this makes me angry too.

Sometimes I watch the show just to get angry and yet I have a strange fascination with the character at the same time. I have been under a lot of mental stress in recent years (self harming in some cases) and often get angry at myself. Sometimes when I am upset I like writing fanfics where this character is either brutally killed or he dies in horrible ways. The character dies in the show sometimes and I like it when violence happens towards this character.

This happens with every single character that looks and acts like me. People often make fun about how I look as well. It has also happened with real people, I met my doppleganger during high school, and I became enemies with him intentionally.

The last fanfic I wrote, this character died from a drug overdose and died while his friends were trying to save him. I made sure to write it as though he died painfully, vomiting blood, having seizures etc.",03Apr2019,1

I have tried new friend groups but find it incredibly hard. I have befriended people in my class (engineering major) but not a lot of girls. The girls I am friends with are just very different from me, and don't really seem like they want to hang out :/ 

I'm trying not to think or my upcoming birthday as an anniversary of the horrible breakup with my last friends, but because we're still friends with a lot of the same people I see them around. It took me too long to figure out they were very negative for me and manipulative, so I've also realized I may not be good at making friends because I'm not completely comfortable with myself.

Watch these videos:

https://youtu.be/V_ga94-AUdE
https://youtu.be/jusDJvI8FaA

They were made in the 2010s but they don't differentiate the 00s and 10s. This really bothers me.  Because I think the 00s were a solid decade for music,  games, cartoons,  movies but no one ever talks about them. Probably cause we never found a proper name for them.


I feel like we're experiencing a ""millennium nostalgia glitch"" because I should've sworn that by 2006 everyone was already talking about the 90s! Is that true? Nobody in 2016 talked like this about the 00s, we were still on the 90s. There's even [a page](https://www.retrojunk.com/article/show/119/10-reasons-why-the-90s-beat-the-00s) on Retrojunk FROM 2006 that says the 90s were better than the 2000s! 


Now don't get me wrong,  I know there's alot of people who ARE nostalgic for the 00s today.  But they only say that under certain circumstances. Like when the video itself is about the 00s. When the videos about any other decade (90s, 80s, 70s) people act like everything after 2000 is the same.  Or when they say ""90s and early 2000s"" but that only includes up to 2005. (HELL, some people call the entire 00s ""the early 2000s""!)


I hate when people say oh 2000s music and cartoons aren't good as the 90s, then proceed to mention Nicki Minaj,  Katy Perry, and cartoons like Teen Titans Go, all of which are 2010s things.  It's like they totally forgot there's a whole decade in between.


When will this shit end? But I get it,  the 00s and 10s just don't feel different.  The media does no favors by practically NEVER mentioning the 00s. How do you even say it without sounding weird? Zeroes? Two-thousands? And that's another thing! ""Two thousands"" can mean the century or millennium too! So technically they're not wrong when they do that! But it's kinda unfair to that first decade.


Do you think by the 2020s this will change? Will we finally be nostalgic for the 00s or will we be stuck on the 90s again? That's kind of scary. I feel like for us to truly be nostalgic for the 00s or 10s, life will have to change drastically. There has to be a noticable difference between the 00s and now. Will people look back at the early millennium the same way as the 90s one day? Or has 9/11 ruined it?


Listen this shit really bothers me and I don't know where else to go to find answers.  I'm so obsessed that I scroll down thousands of YouTube comments on 90s related videos just to see what they're talking about the 00s if they make this mistake again",03Apr2019,6

117,"It was a couple of days ago, but I'm still so happy right now it's difficult to express. We were high school sweethearts. She'd walk me around the high school hallways on a leash and throw dog treats at me that I would have to eat. It was an unbelievable feeling being the slave to the woman that I was in love with. I was hers and she wasn't mine.

Ten years later, and she still walks me from time to time. But we have added some variety to our lifestyle. Every 6 months or so, we change it up. From BDSM we went to watersports. From watersports to inflation. From inflation to crossdressing. From crossdressing to food. From food to scat and on and on. 

A couple nights ago, we were playing with an enema in the bedroom, something that is very sentimental to our relationship because we have been using enemas during sex since college. She squirted water into me, and the water emptied out along with other stuff including a ring. I asked her if she would be my bride and she said yes! We're already planning our wedding, and we're gonna name the tables after different kinks and hire a local dom as the dj!",03Apr2019,15
118," 

So basically I've been with my girlfriend for about half a year, she sent nudes to at least 7 different people before me including someone who was a sophomore in college at the time, was in an awful on and off relationship with someone over 2 years older than her, who cheated on her several times. She was in a relationship with a girl in between for at least 5 months that was objectively more wholesome from what I can tell from the other girl's old posts, but she regrets it from what she tells me and she basically lied and led this girl on for the entire time. She also ate this girl out when asked to try it, says she did it ""once or twice,"" now says once. She also told me she had dated her for 2 months, only found out it was 5 from the social media timeline. She had a party where people slept over including her, she had told me they weren't together at the time but social media also disproves this. Basically I think she's only been telling me what she thinks I want to hear to protect me or something but she can't seem to listen to me when I say honesty is more important.

I obsess about this stuff all the time, but since I found out all of the truths about her ex-girlfriend I haven't found it in myself to bring any of this up to her anymore. I had been asking her about what kind of stuff they did together, how they talked to each other, what she liked about her. However, even for objective things such as black and white facts she says she ""blocked that shit out."" Part of me is disgusted that she didn't respect herself enough to say no to this person and that she led this person on, or that she did love her on some level and doesn't respect me enough to tell me the truth.

She was back with the on and off boyfriend (trans male) when we met and she definitely clung to me a lot, but she jokes about sex a lot with our mostly male mutual friends (whom we've both known forever despite not knowing each other) and is very huggy and touchy with them and a lot of other people, to the point where people expect hugs from her. She never officially broke up with her boyfriend, let him keep hugging her even in front of me and went to have the conversation about her wanting to be with me and that somehow ended in her getting a hickey from him. She told me immediately and my brain just sort of didn't accept it for a month, I couldn't think about it or be bothered by it. She continued to let him do things like cry on her shoulder, and at a party she left me alone for 40 minutes and let her ex take her away to talk this through. I have no suspicion they did anything but talk but it still hurts so much that she thought it was okay to leave me alone and be alone with him like that.

Starting then all of the issues with her past started to become crippling to me and they have been ever since. I've had moments of pure rage at her, though I've never really called her names and I've certainly never laid a hand on her. This bothers me so much because I see so much of my father in myself when I get mad like that, and I had promised myself that I would never show her that side of me. For a long period of time I literally couldn't stop myself from questioning her and continuing to talk about these things even when she asked me to stop.

The reason I get so upset is because all of my life abstinence has been so important to me. I've dated other people before but never more than a few weeks at a time. I'd never so much as kissed anyone before her, because I knew I was waiting for the right person. I knew she was it when I met her, but it hurts so much that I've slowly learned more and more about her past and how she not only didn't wait but has sent nudes to people she didn't know, tolerated cheating and consented to a sexual act with someone she says she didn't love. We've had a lot of very intimate sex but all the while this has bothered me in the background and I can barely get myself to school anymore for fear of seeing the people from her past. She alternates from calling me a child for not being able to stop being angry for one second to saying that all of my anxieties are her fault because she didn't wait. She loves me so much and has told me she wants to spend the rest of her life and in a perfect world that would happen because I really have never loved anyone as much as I love her but I can't see myself getting past this.

I find myself scouring my past trying to find any relationship I've had that is equivalent to things she's done, telling her these things even when she doesn't want to hear them, even exaggerating and trying to make myself believe I did things that I really didn't really do. I just need myself to be okay with what she did. She's frustrated because she's changed so much for me, and I just feel guilty that I made her feel bad about herself and made her change when in reality I'm upset about the past, which can't be changed. It also concerns me that the changes she did make, such as being less touchy, were because I complained about them so much and not because they happened naturally or because she wanted to be better for her own sake. I feel so guilty for influencing her like that unnecessarily. It makes me uncomfortable that she sometimes seems like a completely different person than when we met.

Also, about 3 months in I started getting the idea that if I had the same experiences she had and had multiple partners I could come back to her later with a more open mind. Never did I want anything but to end up with her, however. I went on a school trip without her but with one of her best friends who despite previously resenting for (in my opinion) influencing her and getting her into the act of sending nudes to people, is one of the funniest and most insightful people I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. I got to know a lot about her childhood and anger issues and their similarities to mine and I felt really close to her. On one night of the trip a group of boys and girls stayed in her hotel room overnight and shared beds. I shared her bed with one other person, and I ended up holding her and eventually kissing and caressing her, and both of us had our hands down each other's pants before we finally stopped. I immediately told her that it couldn't happen again, and she agreed as she has her own boyfriend of 4 months.

However, when I went home I had hallucinations during sex and laying with my girlfriend of this other girl's face. I am still good friends with her but I can't help but feel that we've pretty much ruined our friendship, despite it being the closest friendship I've ever had. I was going to tell my girlfriend that same day but she had been in and out of the hospital for severe headaches for several days and I couldn't bring myself to tell her during that. It ended up taking 2 weeks for me to finally tell her, and I will never forgive myself for not telling her immediately, let alone doing it in the first place. I had a period where I really thought I was going to kill myself, I felt I had ruined my life by cheating on anyone, I have always harboured such a resentment for anyone who cheats under any circumstances and I couldn't handle the fact that I did it myself.

She forgave me after a few days however, and it all just feels so wrong to me. She had always said how she was worried about me leaving her, saying ""it always happens eventually,"" and I basically proved her right. It bothers me that she can be okay with this, I can't help but think about how she tolerated cheating in the past. Even still, I can't accept what she's done and I can't live like this anymore. There's a good chance she might see this but I don't really mind, she knows I'm thinking most of this stuff anyway. Any advice at all?",03Apr2019,1

122,"\[It is my conclusion after having matched several elements, so I will avoid writing down names for now\]

A few days ago I found the adv of a flat on sale in Barcelona. The price was great so I got in touch with the owner. She got me back explaining a bit who she was - a doctor who had to move in the UK for work - and she told me she hadn't enough time to handle the selling process so she would have passed it to an international real estate agency .

I wrote an email to the contact she gave me and the agent wrote me the following email:

&gt; The property can be reserved in your name for a private visit; you further have the step-by-step description of the manner of scheduling a visit:  
&gt;  
&gt;**\*** In order to start the procedure, we will need the following details from you:  
&gt;  
&gt;**#** Your complete name\*\*:\*\*  
**#** Complete address:  
**#** Telephone number:  
**#** Fax number (if available):  
&gt;  
&gt;**\*** The next step is filling in a pre-contract for setting the private visit. I would mention that this contract shall not bind you by any means to purchase the property, only the terms of the transaction are specified in this document.  
&gt;  
&gt;**\*** You, as a potential purchaser, shall receive a notification containing a transaction identification number which shall give you access to the privatea area of the clients on our website.  
&gt;  
&gt;**\*** In your private area, you shall have access to all the details of your transaction, as well as the pre-contract signed and stamped by us.  
&gt;  
&gt;**\*** At this point, you, as potential purchaser, with an exclusive purchasing right, shall have to constitute an earnest money deposit at our agency, within maximum 72 hours from generating the contract. The payment must be made by bank transfer to one of the agency's trust accounts.  
The total value of the earnest money deposit has been set to 2,5% of the total purchasing price, i.e. **€ 4.275**. Please note that the earnest money deposit is a deposit meant to prove your interest in purchasing the property, and should not be mistaken for a down payment for purchasing the property.  
**\*** After initiating the transfer, you shall have to send the scanned document from the bank to our agency, together with the contract signed by you.  
&gt;  
&gt;**\*** After your payment is confirmed in one of our bank accounts (it usually does not exceed 2 working days), the visit shall be set, and I, as an agent in charge of your transaction, shall be delegated to organize the visit. I mention that I shall be accompanied by a legal representative of the owner. During the private visit, you can check all the property-related aspects, including the accompanying juridical documents.  
&gt;  
&gt; After visiting the property, there shall be 2 possible situations:  
&gt;  
&gt;**1)** In case you decide not to purchase the property, the earnest money deposit shall be reimbursed into your bank account on the same day you visit the property. In this case, the pre-contract shall become null&amp;void. All fees for our services are entirely paid for by the owner.  
**2)** If you decide to buy the property, all the documents shall be signed in the presence of a local notary, and we shall authorize the release of the earnest money deposit to the owner, as a down payment for purchasing the property. They shall also set a certain deadline within which you shall have to pay for the rest of the amount in order to cover the entire price of the property. In this case, you will pay the notary fees; the fees for our services are completely paid for by the landlord who has hired us.

So she was asking 4275€ of deposit to arrange a visit.

I went on their website and the page looked terrible. an international real estate with such a horrible page does not sound right to me. Therefore I inspect the page and in the header i found the indexing tags muted:

&gt;&lt;meta name=""Description"" content="".""&gt;  
&lt;meta name=""robots"" content=""nofollow,noindex""&gt;  
&lt;meta name=""robots"" content=""noindex""&gt;  
&lt;meta name=""googlebot"" content=""noindex""&gt;  
&lt;meta name=""robots"" content=""NOODP""&gt;

on top of that the website was using an http unsecure connection.

I couldn't even find any information about them googling their name, and the address provided in Street View didn't take me to a building I can say it looks an office.

I even did few other tests to get more evidences.

They got my data because I react naively without reading through the email (at first glance I thought they were just talking about their fees after the selling) .

Quite frankly I don't care that much about myself, I'm sure I'll get by, but the entire process was very well thought that someone else could being caught.

It is a suspect of course, but still...

Question is, what shall I do know to avoid that?

but I have sort of a wholesome ‘I don’t work here, lady.” story which I think about from time to time. it makes me smile.
so where I live, lot of farmers markets pop especially during the spring and summer. they sell fruits, vegetables, baked goods, crafts, etc. (I love going to these, you can get the best fruit there.)
anyway, I was standing waiting for my mom while she was buying tomatoes at one booth.  
right next to this booth was a tarp on the ground and whole bunch of watermelons that the booth was also selling. 
I was staring at them (cuz, I don’t know.) and a little old lady asked me “do you know if these watermelons are good?” 
I said “oh, uh... I don’t know I haven’t had one of these, I don’t work here. I’m just here shopping.” 
She smiled at me and laughed and just said “oh, that’s okay! they do look good, I bet they are!” and walked to another booth.

126,"Trying to make things short. I'm in love with boxing since May 2018 It has been my obsession since the first time I saw Ali x Frazier. But I never made any formal classes, 'cause I was in a music course and couldn't afford the music classes AND boxing. 

So I made it clear to my father that when the music classes are over I would start boxing. He agreed. 

Last week, I went to a ""try out class""(don't know how to say this in English) and I loved it. Sayed It to my dad and he simply said that he wouldn't pay for It and when I said that he had previously agreed with It, he said that he thought I was only joking. 

I got out of all the WhatsApp family groups and cutted contact with him. I Just feel stabbed and extremely sad every time I remember this. ",03Apr2019,1
127,"Weird question I know, but I had one last night and when I was hanging out with three of my friends earlier two out of the three of them have had similar dreams.

The parts of the dream we all had in common was that there wasn't any pain and the tooth or teeth came out really easily.  Also it didn't seem weird to any of us in the dream to be pulling them out.

It just seems weird to me that three out of the four of us have had such similar dreams.  Though I guess some dreams seem to be common for a lot of people.  Falling, being chased, ect.",03Apr2019,1

130,"High school has been great; I have forged some of my best memories through the people I've met and the experiences I've had since the age of 11.
I am now approaching my GCSEs and I feel empty, stressed, and above all else, anxious. 

I have no idea where it came from . I have started to care too much about how people perceive me; every glance in my direction is like being told exactly what people are thinking, a reminder of my scruffy hair and increasingly bad acne, a reminder that, when I haven't slept longer than six hours a night for months, my exhaustion looks as bad as it feels. 

I have never liked making phone calls to strangers, booking appointments etc, and just as I've started to get over these mild fears of social interaction, I am suddenly terrified of speaking to many peers I have known for over four years now, even my closest friends acknowledging that  I come across more socially anxious than I ever have before. I feel trapped, suffocated by my thoughts competing with one another and by my every day life. 

And some of these thoughts are becoming increasingly dark, toying with ideas of death and making me question the value of my own life.

I have never felt so alone; and these feelings couldn't have come at a worse time. 

I have known her for as long as any of my high school friends. She is stunning, intelligent, hilarious, and there's noone I like to spend time with more. We have spoken romantically in the past and she knows exactly how I feel now. For a while, even after being told that she didn't want a relationship at all right now, I believed I had a chance. ""Not because it's you"" she had told me. Since then, the two of us have met up alone a couple of times, just me and her and both times have given me nerves - the good kind. She looks at me in a way that makes me feel wanted, and smiles in a way that makes me want her. 

But I've felt a sudden change. 

She doesn't talk to me as much, in person or online. She doesn't hold any enthusiasm in her voice, and the times where I feel any connection are fewer and far between. But I have no way of knowing if this change is because of her, or because of me and my new found anxieties. 

It could be her; she could finally have decided to try and study for the exams she's been avoiding doing any revision for (honestly if that's the truth she's doing better than me), or maybe she straight up decided she didn't want me. 

It could, on the other hand, be me. My nerves, the bad kind, stopping me from being myself, making my voice quieter and my jokes less funny, and making me seem meek and small... It doesn't help that I'm only 5' 9"", yet another insecurity... 

At this point, I'm not sure why I'm posting this (sidenote: this is a throwaway account). I just need a hug. Honestly I just don't know if I want to live to experience my future when I feel this way and I don't see a way out. 

I just want help, and someone to talk to who may have experienced something similar. 

I do not want to be like this, it is not me.  ",03Apr2019,2

132,"Last December I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Back then I was barely moving, apart from occasionally going to the gym; I was living a very sedentary lifestyle. I work (worked, got fired last month smh) in front of a computer and commute by bus so that means most of my time was spent sitting down.

After the doctor told me my diagnosis I started to change a couple of things in my life, since I don't know when exercising will become strenuous.

First I stopped smoking. Then I bought a bike that I'm using every day including weekends, I started hiking and doing mtb trails, I also went back to a nice 6x/week pace on the gym, went back to playing basketball, I even went parachute and rope jumping.

134,"My childhood was rough. Lived in several different places in the first 13 years of my life. Didn’t have much money (until my dad started a business). Struggled in school due to having learning disabilities. Got suspended from school many times. Was arrested five times before the age of of 20. Lived with an abusive narcissistic father who made my life a living hell. I’m 28 now and even though I’ve have a stable career and a professional license and a side business that is doing well. I still suffer from low self esteem and anxiety. 

Imagine your father yelling and belittling you all the time for the slightest things. Imagine having your father forget your birthday and even ruin it by ignoring you the entire day. Imagine a father who threatened to take you out of school because you were struggling. Imagine a father who threatened to disown you if you didn’t get accepted into university. Imagine a father who destroyed your Xbox for getting a 96 on your exam. Imagine a father of ran you over in the driveway in order to teach you a lesson. 

My wife whom I’ve known for nearly 10 years now. Told me to stop being a victim, and wallowing in self pity. I’m really trying but it’s hard. It’s impossible given the emotional abuse and neglect I’ve suffered. Yes I have a successful side business and a professional career but my PTSD, depression and anxiety hinders me sometimes. It’s hard to get over the trauma you experienced as a child. 

I know having a shitty childhood isn’t an excuse to treat people like shit or make bad decisions. I know that I’m responsible for my life now but I still feel waves of depression and sadness and I deal with it by yelling at the wall or punching a pillow. I want to break the cycle and give my future children the childhood I never had growing up. What can I do?!

I’ve had therapy several times over the years without everlasting positive results.

136,"I never tell this story. It's a crazy story, but absolutely true. I won't tell it to anybody in real life. Not to Hannah, who inspired it. Not to any friends. So I'm telling it here.

I am a 22 year old geek.

Last year I was a 21 year old, glasses-wearing geek who was a senior in college with nearly a 4.0 GPA. And I'm still (blush) admittedly a virgin. I'm only about 5'7, a ""studies-while-eating Doritos"" belly on an otherwise normal frame.

I told my friend Hannah about how I like to wake up very early on some days and head to the local nature preserve before class. I'm always alone, and it's beautiful.

She told me that her and her boyfriend used to go, and sometimes, she would strip to the nude.

My eyes bulged. She giggled and said it was not sexual at all. It allowed her to be ""one with nature"".

She said ""You should try it sometime, if you ever got the balls. Literally haha"".

Yeah right. I never even take my shirt off at the beach.

Then, one Tuesday morning at 6:30 am on a bright, sunny, only slightly brisk early Spring Tuesday morning...I got the itch.

I don't EVER do anything out of character. Why not just try it out? Nobody will ever know.

I actually undressed. I took off my heavy boots and long socks. My sweater. My pants. My undershirt.

There I was, shivering (it wasn't THAT cold, just a tad chilly, but the nerves got to me) in nothing but my light blue boxers.

I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and slid them down and kicked them off into the pile.

Now, clad in only my glasses and as bare as a newborn baby, I cupped my package with my hands, and I timidly walked towards the lake, about 50 yards from where I left my clothes, and I looked up at the gorgeous view.

The trees. The mountains. The beautiful, clear, blue lake.

Without even thinking, I placed my hands at my sides.

And there I was. Martin the virgin geek.

Naked.

Buck naked, in fact.

More naked than the trees, which were ""clothed"" in leaves.

More naked than Adam in the Garden of Eden, who at least had a fig leaf.

I was exposed. Not just physically, but exposed to new excitement and beauty.

Inspired, I even walked around the entire lake, as naked as the day I was born.

My round, bare belly shaking. My white-as-a-ghost ""bubble butt"" that Hannah would also make me blush over that she said I was always ""hiding"" under my nerdy khakis jiggling behind me. And my small package (hey, it's a throwaway!) bobbing in the brisk air.

I walked around the entire lake.

The crisp breeze occasionally startling me by caressing my bare butt. The tickle of a few flowers on my belly and package as I walked. The feel of the fresh grass through my bare feet as I walked.

Standing there, basking in the view, it was then that I heard it.

""Beautiful, simply beautiful.""

It was a woman. About 43 years old. Pretty, with a slight hard-to-pinpoint foreign accent.

She had a GIGANTIC, expensive, HD camera. And directly taking photos - OF ME!!!

I stood there frozen in shock, eyes wide, mouth open, as naked as a newborn baby with my hands at my sides in the bright sunshine for about 5 full seconds.

Then in a panic, I cupped my package with my hands and I ran behind a tree as she giggled and kept snapping photos of the scenery.

I poked my head out from behind the large tree, hiding my vulnerable, naked body behind it, with the now colder breeze attacking my bald, defenseless white buttcheeks behind me.

""You can't take those pictures!""

She said ""I sure can, sweetie. We're out in a public space. Nobody forced you to go traipsing around in your birthday suit.""

I replied: ""You can't share those photos!!""

She said ""Relax, and don't be so embarrassed. I've seen many men in the nude over the years. I'm no virgin here.""

That made me blush beat red.

She said ""For ruining my carefully planned shoot, I'm going to use these photos to create a painting.""

As I spoke up, I felt my naked, white butt-cheeks jiggling as I was shaking in panic and anger.

I said: ""A painting?! Of what?"" as I clung desperately to the tree shielding my body from her gaze.

She smirked. ""A painting showcasing true bravery and vulnerability.""

I said ""I'm no model for a painting.""

She replied: ""Oh, but you are, nude boy. It's one thing for some confident, viking man to walk around here. You're not one of those types, with some big, silly penis flopping around to show off.""

I subconsciously placed a single hand over my package, even from behind the tree.

She said: ""But you. You're the true picture of vulnerability. Your lily-white skin. Your adorable chubby belly. A hint of a bosom on you, even with hard nipples in the cool air.""

She giggled. And I subconsciously used my other hand to hide my nipples like a damsel in distress.

""And your little penis exposed for the world to see. Standing fearlessly, without cover, in the open. Clothed by nothing but your smattering of body hair, and a slight, endearing pink blush across your cheeks. I'm going to paint you.""

My ""pink"" blush turning RED as I cried: ""But you can't!!""

She said ""I can, and I will. Google me."" She gave me her name.

""Your bare body will be in my gallery in a few months.""

Defeated, I said ""Well I'm going back around the lake, the least you can do is give my dignity and avert your eyes.""

She said ""I'll do no such thing. I have more photos to take. Now go run along, naked boy. Get that cute tushie running around the lake and get dressed, it's getting cold.""

As I ran around the entire lake, with absolutely no cover, feeling my bubble butt literally shaking behind me, I turned to see her unflinchingly smirking and staring at me. And even snapping a few more final photos.

A few months later, I did Google her, and sure enough, there I was.

A sight that a girl had never seen before, my naked body. It was expertly painted I must say, with unfortunately exquisite detail. A lush greenery set against beautiful mountains, with my blushing, eyes wide, mouth open, naked spectacle, arms at my sides, standing in front. My small penis and balls prominently displayed right in front.

With 2,000 favorites on her website. She displayed it in a gallery. It was sold for $5,600.

And it hangs right in the lobby of my town's city hall. Amazingly, nobody has noticed it's me. Or, they are too embarrassed to tell me...

139,"I had a panic attack about to leave the house. I didn't do this without having a main job to fall back on; it just feels bad quitting a job I guess. 

Last 2 jobs I quit I had a fallback job, this one lasted the longest at like 6 months or so. 

I had a job last year as a custodian at a school in the evening and it was a genuinely toxic environment, you'd think janitors would be chill but the two senior custodians were both pill heads, the other two juniors were 1. a social anxiety wreck who played into one of the pillheads' shit and 2. a fat guy who moved slowly, everyone else shit on, and clearly only stayed there for paid vacation to smoke weed. I quit that motherfucker mid shift one night so I could catch the bus; most nights I got off at 11 and would have to bike for 45 unforgiving minutes home on a walmart bike after 8 straight hours on my feet carrying a heavy ass vacuum. Lmao I lasted like 3 weeks. 

A year before THAT it was KFC, they were teaching me how to make chicken, the main and the evening managers commented on how much flour I had on my *black* uniform and *black* apron after *learning to make kentucky fucking fried chicken.* I quit the next goddamned day. 

Anyways, management sucked and people were miserable, 10/10 glad I quit, 0/10 hated the panic attack. ",03Apr2019,1

141,"I want to say it's been almost a decade without friends in my life. I actually enjoy not having friends. I do want to point out that I am not a lone wolf or anything. I associate with my family especially in certain get togethers, but the obligations you feel when doing those things are different than when you decide hang out with friends. I guess I just don't care to put the effort in, knowing the type of ""friends"" I hung out with in the past.

My reasons for not caring about friendship may not be agreeable to you, but it fits my lifestyle. 

I've always kept to myself and have always been known as the introverted/shy girl who enjoys staying at home and just relaxing. I am also the type who hates drama and dealing with other people's nonsense shit. With friends back in high school and college, I've noticed things that would annoy me:

If you choose to not attend an event or social gathering they planned, they make you seem like the a hole for saying no (or try to guilt trip you to go). In my shoes, like I said, I'm introverted and rarely like to go out. I have made efforts to go out a couple times, but it just seems awkward since I'm not comfortable in that type of environment. It's just not my type of scene, but they were all about going out Friday nights blah blah (and probably still are to this day). 

Without friends, you get to do things on your own terms and not have to deal with nonsense backlash and drama/gossip. I love the freedom to do things when I feel like it or when I want to. Family can sometimes already provide bs and drama so no point in trying to uphold something that was just meant to dissipate over time. Friends might be alright to have while in school, but afterwards if the connections aren't PURE then what the heck is the point of trying. Sure, you might meet just ONE or two great people, but other than asking how you've been or catching up on each others' lives, there doesn't seem to be a point.

I wonder if this makes sense to readers or if it just looks strange that someone wouldn't give a flick about friendship.",03Apr2019,1
