College is expensive, child care is expensive, government assistance is complicated and feels invasive at times, my only choice is deal with the trap that is government assistance or work myself to death in a factory. I have subsidized housing and the more money I make the more my rent goes up, so I still can’t afford to get my license or a car. If I get a job that pays well enough to rent a house or apartment around here I’ll have to pay full price for the apartment I’m in, which would make me unable to get together the money to rent somewhere else. I know there’s ways around it but everything is so complicated and it seems the only choice I have is work to death, I’ll never get to spend time with my son but I’ll be able to afford an actual house and a car and stuff.

11,"My older brother is acting like a lunatic. I really want to tell here because I'm ashamed of telling someone else. I need help! Excuse my language and  writing much but i want you to feel it.

I’m an 18-year-old high school graduate. My brother is 4 years older than me and unemployed. My brother and I have been out of order since we were little. We couldn't share anything. We couldn't sit together. We used to argue a lot. It was the classic brother fights. But the problem is. we have grown and our problems have grown with us.

My brother has been a ridiculous boy since his childhood. It was strange. He didn't have many friends. When I grew up in high school, my brother and I started to fight more and they were more violent. And my father didn't fix the door for us to take lessons. My brother and I don't get along. In the past, fights were always a simple problem. For example, I would not put the soap on the soap dish in the bathroom. We'd fight. I wouldn't let my brother play the computer. We'd fight. But we've grown up and it's really shit.

My brother had a hard life in high school. In the first year of high school, he only went to school for three days. But i wish i could say he did something else instead of going to scohol.NO, he just slept… at home… all day he slept like an ox whole day. I was young back then. But now I realize. My brother was depressed. He used to woke up at 7 in the morning. Every day he used something as an excuse. He took off the pants button and used it as an excuse. They would argue with my mother. My mother used to accuse her of not going to school on purpose. He was griping a lot.My brother refused. They would argue. I was waking up an hour after my brother. And I'm sure he made an incident every morning without exception.

In short, my brother was a troubled person. He couldn't handle his own business. he never studied. When high school is over; He couldn't get it to the college. Failed the exam. My father sent him to work to a familiar guy he was a welder, at least to make money. He worked for a year. He used to grumble about how hard the job is. He was easily tricked into people. He had stolen his money or a valuable item too many times. My mother always told her to walk upright .But no . He walks very aggressively on the road. In the outside he looks like a complete idiot. So it is easy to fool. 

Because he's ignorant of job security. Without realizing it, he had a hernia. And because he was afraid to tell us that he had something wrong at his body,didn’t tell us. We went to the hospital 3 months after the hernia grew. begged the doctor, he finally agreed. But my brother was stubbornly grumbling that the operation would hurt. We dealt a lot. He cried every night because of the pain of the stitches.

Although he has corrected herself a bit in recent years, he has a really disturbing life. This year I am preparing for the college exam. A long way. But, I cannot really study in this house. I don't even know where to start telling you.

My brother is 26 and unemployed now. He lives with us because we live in a small town and my parents think he can't live in another city. And that's really a big burden on me. We stay in the same room and behave like an animal. When he wakes up, he makes a lot of noise in the house. Very irregular nutrition and etc My brother eats by himself after the whole family finished eating. And he sleeps at least 13 hours a day. I understand him because he has no job to do. He has 2-3 friends, but they pity him and they stay friendly to him. They're aware of his strange structure. I think he's on the verge of depression. But even if I do what I can to help him.? ☹

Sometimes I get so angry that I want to KILL HIM.I thought several times. My mother and father bothers the same situation. It's not my mom or dad. they are both really good people and friendly. But my brother's mad at my mom one day. he blames my father another. I think my brother's got some mental problems. I am not sure. He's not as dumb as a monkey, I mean at some tests he even take greater score than me. But he's really hard to communicate. we disagree. If he loses an argument, he tries to justify himself true by informing the other one’s weaknesses. We had succeeded to talk like real guys sometimes. but only if he wants to. He can be a nice guys sometimes. But he talks about nonsense things and disturbs me. Asks stupid questions. So I keep it away. My brother has been talking to himself since I was 10 years old. OH YEAH For example, when my father explained to him why he should not speak to himself in public. He refuses to argue. He's acting like they're blaming him to be stupid. He doesn't know how to treat people. He upset them when he's joking. Or he puts himself in a funny position ☹

1 month ago. My brother and I had a very intense arguments. It was 12 pm at night. I told him to leave the house if he isn’t gonna follow the rules. He said he didn't want to. I forced him to get out of the house. He went out in all his majesty. I thought I finally succeeded it. Then I opened the door slowly. I heard him crying very silently while leaving the house fastly. I couldn’t stand X( . I went after him. Found him and then we argued on the street until 4 o'clock. Even though I can't solve it, I've told him unlimited times how good our parents are. And what a good life we have to live ahead. We were not people with disabilities and why we should praise for that. He apologized and said he wouldn't do it again. He said he is gonna hug his dad as soon as he got home. And more. AND the same thing happened the next day's dinner. Uhhh.He found a job lately. But it does himself used by other persons easily. He works for very little money.

If you've read my brother's story so far, thank you very much for having a thought about me. 

I can't stand it lately. My studying isn t going well ,is really boring and I can't focus. They argue every night. And something very different happened tonight. My father changed his attitude. My father was always in favor of reconciliation. He never hit my brother. (My father is old and suffering from diabetes. So I'm really worried about these stressful times. He also smokes 1.5 packs a day. I mean, he's already a depressed man.) This is exactly what happened tonight; At 11 pm I was playing video games with my friend,I don’t play video games usually. But he asked me to play. We were talking. I laughed a little loud than usual. My mother was with me and she didn't say anything about it. Despite this, my brother got up from the other room and came to me and shouted at me; “Don't you know the neighbors are asleep at this hour? Look at you seated there playing games nothing to do. "" Said. I got angry and hung up. It's none of your business. I said. After that, he started yelling at me. Mom warned us to be quiet. My brother suddenly said that he had decided to sleep in a ridiculous way and immediately went to bed which is next to the computer.I told him that he does it on purpose he is not sleeptime. I realized that I didn't turn off the computer so he got angry and went to bed to make me silent. Meanwhile, I got kicked out of the game so banned. and got angry. We started talking louder. I was complaining about my brother giving me orders. At that moment my father came and scolded us that our voice was too loud. And he was mad at him for acting fakely. My brother said to him very loudly “Shut up ”. My father, mother and brother went to the kitchen to discuss.

Five minutes later, I heard my mother was crying out while saying inaudible things. I ran to kitchen, What I saw when I went to the kitchen made me soo angry. My brother went full-mad and shouted at my mother he was saying, ""What can you do huh?"" My father was sitting with a sad face there. Then my mom started hitting my brother when she had enough. My brother was screaming insults like a maniac. Then, he talked to my father said,. Have you looked at yourself? What can you do with your weak body? he pushed. after all these years My father punched my brother in the face. and said, ”Behave yourself” “After all these years, should we kick you out? "" said . I couldn't stand the events and left the house and walked aimlessly while in tears.I used to smoke but i quit 9 months ago and I really don’t care about the damage right now. But I wont gonna buy a pack. Because I know how hard it is to quit owing to my dad. 

Now im in a park about 500m away. I really don't know what to I got no one to tell these. I'm really embarrassed to tell actually.I wonder what kind of illness he has. I don't want doctors giving my brother medicine to turn him into a sleeping addict. He's a really strange person and his making my life persecution. Please give me advices.

13,"Comforting someone can be hard, especially when you arent good at words or know what to say. People need comforting for all sorts of things; death, loss of a job, panic attacks, not winning anything from their $5 lottery tix.

(I am aware this sub isnt for advice. So don't feel you need to answer my question.)

Anyways, im frustrated. When someone keeps repeating the same cycle of self sabotage, and then freaking out because of their own lack of action. It can be annoying. 

i.e. You forget when your work is due, and then the night its due you panic. I tell you that you should write down deadlines, set alarms so you know when to work on things, put it on a calendar. But after that one instance, you KEEP forgetting and then panicking. 

This cycle is tiring. Just learn to write it down, just find a way to remember. I cannot comfort someone who keeps doing this to themselves. You tell me youre overwhelmed? I have to constantly comfort someone who wont learn his lesson, and then tip toe on eggshells to make sure I dont hurt your feelings. Get it together. Or we cannot be together.",20Sep2019,1

26,"Hi Reddit,

I want to know how many people (at least in this subreddit) share the same belief as I do about avoiding or being averse to any kind of risk in life.

I was born and raised in southeast Asia for a majority of my life and moved to the US 10 years ago. I have lived my life with squatters and shanty houses, and am fortunate to not be living there anymore. I share this because I want to put context that I’ve seen the majorly shit part of life and the minority good part of life and experienced context in both.

Moving to the US, the culture here seems to push the constant chase of “risk” to achieve “dreams”. I always hear the underdog, success, “started from the bottom now we’re here” stories. “I started 200 bucks to start my business, slept on corrugated board on a moist basement and now I get to go to Europe as much as I want because I built my own business”. To me, sure that’s good for the individual and I support and respect the bravery, guile and perseverance to get to that level.

Moreso, in the US the going big or go home mentality is at the highest. Look at the lotteries, with how many people buy in and only 1 winner comes out. Where the price of investment is an obvious, statistical monetary loss.

My perspective is: how many people have had the same starting point only to fail? It’s why winners are called “winners”; in a race or competition, only 1 wins. Out of the many “success stories” there are, millions of losers are down and out. Sure, many of the “losers” started with nothing and it could only have gotten better from there on out (or live then die in sheer, inescapable poverty), but how many of the “losers” had a pretty good leg to stand on in life before they made the bet on “risk” but lose everything afterwards.

To me, risk is inherent but should be avoided if an option to do so presents itself. I am the turtle in the race with the hare. I coldly calculate my odds and proceed with the highest statistical chance of winning even if another path with more risk and higher reward is available. In the most extreme sense, here’s and example: “if you have a 1% chance of getting bitten off by a shark in the ocean, it is incredibly low and you statistically will probably be fine. But, it only takes that 1% of occurring to ruin 99% of your life. Would you really take the chance, or have the same experience in a safer environment without sharks?”. 

My point is, so many people take risks that ended up being a loss when following a safer path would have netted them a success. I have been looked down upon by so many people because of my lifestyle; frankly I don’t care but find it amusing how “not getting married, not having relationships or sex (and risk STDs), not taking psychoactive substances (which includes alcohol), not job-hopping and monkey branching to better jobs with more up-front money, not moving out from where I live, not starting my own business” is so looked down upon. Sure, I get this flak from those “success story” folk as well, but if I follow my current and safe path, I will be a close and undisputed 2nd place (maybe even first) and will be richer than so many people who took the unneeded risk. I am not the richest but I am far from the poorest, and I will never risk this for a 1% (even a 20%) chance to be the richest person on the planet

I have seen how bad it can get. I’ve lived it. Living in a shit neighborhood where the sewers overflow the streets is not something to glamorize and editorialize on your “success story” and “if I can do it, you can do it too” mentality, because a lot of success is chance.

Before anyone gets this wrong, I am not talking about avoiding being the best person that you can. I am talking about safe life investment. Sure, be the best at what you do and be content with your work at the end of the day. But by god, if you have $2K on your bank and your rent is $1K, don’t invest it in starting up your own business. Save up money, cut unnecessary spending, save up til you got an emergency fund and enough of an investment fund THEN start your business. If you have to eat shit at work, do it because you will have a 100% chance at victory in the far future. Over 90% of small business fail in the US, and all of those business owners had the same mentality as the “underdog winners”.

I apologize if this was unnecessarily long. I just want to share this though and am interested if other people share it.",20Sep2019,3
27,"I was in the shower and I had an idea.   I thought to myself, what if tomorrow I simply go through my day as if I’m the highlight of everyone else’s day...   that when I go get coffee, gas, or go to the gym, I just manage myself intentionally as the potential highlight for another.

I started to think about what that would look like in practical terms, and what I envisioned was that the secret to being the highlight of anyone’s day would be to treat that person as the highlight of my day.   To listen to people newly, with real intent and curiosity.   To acknowledge people I encounter for anything I notice.   To greet everyone as someone unique, important, and respected.   

To be the the highlight of the day for others simply looks like making everyone the highlight of mine.   

What would this do in your life?   Relationships?   At work?   In your marriage?   At that job interview?

What if we could set aside the automatic narratives we form around others, and just be with people and allow them to inspire us?   To be generous enough to truly listen to people.   To get them and where they are at, and what they are all dealing with?

So I’m going to wake up, and choose to be the highlight and see what that’s like distinct from how I’ve already been.   Anyone else want to try?",20Sep2019,7

But if he were to do it, would i feel responsible for not saying something?

30,"Hiya. The title might appear to be misleading, but it’s really not. Secondly, this isn’t some elaborate allegory, it’s literal. For context, I’m 16, and that fact makes everything below 1000% worse.

I’m very ashamed to admit, that I’m addicted to compliments. On paper it sounds minor, though a bad habit regardless, but it’s worse than that. 

I’ve had low self esteem for a while, as long as I can remember. I don’t receive compliments much in my usual day-to-day, I’m almost impressively unimpressive. 

Still, that feeling of receiving a compliment is so amazing that I can’t help but chase it, it’s like a total satisfaction with myself, if even only for a second. Because of this, I’ve gotten into the habit of chasing compliments in what has truly been the lowest of any sources. 

Online, I’d seek out older men (yes I’m ashamed as you could possibly imagine, it makes me wanna shoot myself that this is fact), and swap unsavory images with them, to say the least, in hopes of receiving a compliment. 

This has continued off and on for over two years. I can’t help myself, every time I’m at my lowest it’s pretty much become second nature to do so. I’ve tried stopping over 10 times, and I’ve burned through over ten accounts, spanning from Kik, to Snapchat, and every potentially dangerous messaging service for someone my age. 

I would like to make it clear, that in no way, shape, or form, was I preyed upon, and rather, I sought out these people. That to me, is the worst part of it all. I can’t even hide behind the guise of “I was a naive kid, preyed upon by an ill intentioned adult”, when in some way it was the opposite. 

In brighter news, I’ve been “clean”, so to speak, for over two weeks. That honestly though, isn’t really that impressive, but I’m satisfied with it anyway. 

That’s really all, I just wanted to share this mess, and beyond that, I think I wanted an adult opinion on this. I don’t know what I’d do if an actual adult in my life had the slightest clue about this, so I’ve chosen the, admittedly reckless option instead.",20Sep2019,1

Background on why I'm asking:
I'm going to therapy for depression/anxiety/other things I don't want to get into and my therapist assigned me homework to talk to someone online, so here I am.

However (warning: small rant incoming), I'm confused as to why she assigned me this as homework. I don't have significant issues holding causal conversations in real life, and I especially don't have issues holding conversations online since I have more time to think of a response. I told my therapist this during the session. I also told her that my real issues are determining whether someone wants to be friends with me as well as how to go from being acquaintances to being friends.

I probably should have asked her what the purpose of this homework was during our session but I was really sleep-deprived that day so it didn't occur to me. :/ If anyone has advice on the friends thing I would appreciate it, but I mainly just want someone to talk to me so I can say that I did my homework.

34,"I’m 20 years old, two years out of high school. After graduation I chose to completely stop being active on social media. I didn’t post, nor did I keep up to date on the lives of the people I walked away from. I broke up with my girlfriend and I only kept in contact with people who put as much effort into a friendship as me. 

Two years have passed, and I just recently started seeing what the people I left behind are doing. Some people are thriving. Some are not. Some of the people I was friends with are completely different people. It’s extra weird to see girls liked throughout the years and how they’ve grown, or stayed the same. 

I’ve had my fair share of growth too. I lost about 40lbs last year and now I’m about to start working out at a gym to gain a bit of muscle. I changed career plans and I am about a year away from a well paying, almost guaranteed career. I have a “best friend” for the first time in my life, and I have plenty of hobbies. Personality-wise, I’m much more confident and headstrong. I’m more sociable and people look to me for advice about things. 

All in all, life is weird. High school feels like the world. Then you enter the world and you grow and change in new ways. And then you see people from your past and the people they’ve become.

40,"I mean let's be honest. That's the main purpose in anyone's life. Even if they have kids / family whatever work is the most important thing to support them. Anything you wanna do for enjoyment has to be secondary to work like it or not and you probably won't have the energy to do it anyway. Hobbies, interests, passions, friends, family all have to be secondary to work because you need money for all of those things and just literally to survive. 



Whenever I bring this up people just say you have to find ways to distract yourself from this reality. I guess they don't see how terrible that is too. 



I don't want to be alive if all I have to look forward to is spending half of my waking hours for 50 years working and the rest of the time recovering or distracting myself from work.

42,"When I was still a kid all the way through to my early 20s, I lived a live where my whole family was absent so there's not much parental figure to guide me, and I was so closed off that I could never share anything I feel with anyone even even if it's someone that I would consider my best friend, I would hire prostitute as a teenager just so I could proof to myself that I could love someone and just so I wouldn't spend the night alone, I was fucking miserable and I know it.

The craziest thing is that even though I know that I was miserable, I always thought to myself that I deserve a better life than this, and that's what change, over the years even though my life is getting better, I have a loving partner, my family starting to get closer and actually started to bond with one another, I realize that there's nothing that I love about myself and this fucking kills me.

In my head there's only two modes for me, either there's nothing I could do to make the pain numb or I feel so fucking numb that the days turned into nights without myself taking notice. It's tiring living like you would welcome dying at anytime of the day, and all I could wish is that I die a death worth celebrating. I'm just tired of being alive while there's so much more to look forward in my life, and I hate myself for feeling like this while knowing how ungrateful I am with my life.",20Sep2019,2

I really don’t want to feel like this and I wish I could see my therapist like once a month instead of every two weeks but I just fucking can’t and it makes me so mad that I can’t be normal.

44,"Background: I'm in my second year of college right now, and I've been struggling to make new friends. A few high school friends and I still occasionally meet up to eat or smoke, but they is the extent of my social group outside of any obligational settings (classes/work). On the outside, I am living a pretty good life. But inside I feel very lonely, even though I do meet up with different friends a couple times a week and have conversations about our lives and feelings. I have a job and like the people I work with. But these work relationships aren't strong and don't extend beyond our shifts.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I came to the realization that I have been unable to empathize with most of the people close to me in a meaningful way. I'm always competing with these people (mostly other guys), seeing who has a better life. It really sucks because I want to genuinely about these people, and I want to wish them success in everything they do. But when they are succeeding, I feel like I am falling behind, which builds up resentment among these people. This resentment is never malicious, but it's always present like a raincloud over my friendships. Like, someone gets a girlfriend or gets to work on a cool project, and I do not feel happy for them. I'll always react positively, and cheer them on, but it isn't coming from a place of sincerity. I wish they weren't doing better than me, because I'm insecure about the life I have. I think the thing that this is holding me back from building strong friendships with people. This is probably also why I can't form lasting connections with people at work or in my classes.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that just because I identified this problem doesn't mean I've solved it. I am reflecting on my relationships with people, and trying to see things in a more supportive light. I feel sick that my insecurity is imposing barriers on people I care about, or people I want to get to know. This probably won't be some quick fix, but I'm hopeful for the future.",20Sep2019,1

47,"TL;DR all the therapists ive seen dont help nor seem to know what they're doing. im wasting an hour of my life showing up because im leaving more emotionally drained. therapist i currently see goes on tangents that take over majority of the session. ive mentioned it before in text but it keeps happening and i have a hard time speaking up.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had a handful of therapists over the course of since I was about 15 y/o. I'm 22 now and not one helped. You're probably thinking I'm the common denominator.. maybe so because I don't take charge of the sessions. One therapist barely spoke, one had approaches that didn't work for me, and one was just as much of a mess as I was. She would talk about herself, her rocky relationships and family. she would TEXT multiple times when I'm in the middle of me talking.

Now, I've been seeing a new therapist for several months now. I like her. She was helping me up until recently. I feel like I'm wasting an hour of my life going now. I like that we have a good relationship but I think she sees me too much of a friend. I hadn't seen her in a month because my schedule is so busy but I really needed a session this week. I squeezed one in today and for 40 minutes she talked about herself. I would try to stir it back but she would override me. I only had 20 minutes to talk about myself. She ended up crying to me in the last few minutes about how she missed her mom. I feel bad for saying this but it felt unprofessional. Not only did she cry but she started saying how she sees her mom in me.. which right before she said her mom was a mess. She started encouraging me to become a therapist because I'm a good listener. She's already told me several times I should be a therapist before.

It just annoyed me because I don't want to be a therapist. I'm not here to play therapist. Everyone already uses me for an ear, nobody lets me fucking talk and express myself. After my handful of experiences, I'm just realizing how I get more out of venting on strangers reddit than I do in therapy. I also feel like doctors take advantage of my good insurance and don't take me seriously. Thanks to anyone who read all this.",20Sep2019,2

53," “Life is a comedy to those who think, a tragedy to those who feel.” ―  Jean Racine

Et bien, Monsieur Racine, mais que peut-on faire pour quelqu'un qui pense et ressent?

What can be done for one who both thinks *and* feels?

Mom took a prescription overdose of painkillers when I was fifteen. By the time I was eighteen, my alcoholism had progressed to daily drinking. I was a late-bloomer anyway, this didn't help. I knocked up a woman I was dating. I was 21. The marriage lasted two years. Next to ""Classic 'Woman Scorned' in the dictionary"" is a picture of my first wife. When Dad's final heart attack killed him at 43, I was 23. No brothers, one sister nine years my junior. Nine months later my new girlfriend, a co-worker I had been in love with for almost a year said ""Yes"" to being exclusive. 


This was a special person. She did volunteer work reading to the blind, and at the local family planning clinic, worked for a political candidate she believed in. She was stunningly beautiful and in her early twenties did not fully understand her effect on men - no, not kidding. She once moved to a sketchy neighbor hood and started working at the local greasy spoon. She had to be apprised of what her nearly waist-length hair, and a shape reminiscent of [young Brigitte Bardot](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=pictures+of+young+brigitte+bardot&amp;t=ffsb&amp;ia=images) could do. Again, no. Not kidding. She did not have BB's fine facial bones, but had a more Nordic beauty. And that does not begin to describe her radiance. Have you ever met someone who just shines? A person who when they enter a room full of people standing and talking at a party, cause a shift in how people move around the room? The draw certain people toward them, both men and women? I've seen this described, usually attributed to a strong spiritual bond, almost Shamanic, as it was with her. Smart, beautiful, funny, possessed of some level of magic. As well as my heart. 

I was soul-sick. The suicide had blown my head off, watching my beautiful, 36-year-old mother take her last breath on the living room floor. Dad was a genius, a legit Renaissance man, my rock. His death seven years later had left me gutted. Admiring her, spending lunches with her, I *felt* better, physically and mentally. Her Shaman rubbing up against my wounded empath.  I was crazy in love. We were both 23.

 I had been being a friend, a secret admirer. The only way I managed was because I wanted her so badly that I figured out the *only* path to her heart lay in acting exactly as if I had no designs on her at all. None. And I made it work. No one knew (other than the intermittent guy-to-guy expressions of appreciation for such a beauty) I had any interest, although I'm pretty sure my poker face doesn't extend to having a lunch by the river with the girl of my dreams. But she was cool. She waited until I asked to let me know she'd been looking my way, too. I suspect I was the straw that broke the back of the camel that was her LTR. She'd met him at sixteen, and had outgrown him. I asked her to be mine on a Thursday, and she swore me to secrecy. I didn't know it was so she could go talk to her quasi-ex boyfriend to make it official that he was through, whether or not he was done. She gave him a poem she had written including the line ""love each other enough to set the other free"" on Friday.

On her way home late Monday night she was brutally stabbed to death, one of the wounds piercing her heart. She was left to die in a snowbank beside the road. 

I hadn't even kissed her.

 [Sometimes someone else writes the song your soul is singing..](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmsU0JfnmpU&amp;pbjreload=10). And  the timeline makes no sense at all. But the line about ""take a bath..."" Yeah. I'm right there. I have encountered great beauty..., but the Japanese have a word, shibumi, that means ""effortless perfection"" -'a simplicity of spirit; an attitude of refinement without pretension, honesty without apology, beauty without artifice'. Yes. If you were given that description, and she was in a group of two dozen women, you would pick her out.

Having been inoculated against suicide by my Mom, I kept existing, and met and got involved with crazy, who before she left the area, fucked my entire social circle, including my wife-to-be.

For a few years, I owned a very distinctively numbered cab medallion, which would later be worth a quarter-million dollars. The daily drinking had led to poor decision-making, and the cab was running uninsured. I was in the bar playing pinball when I realized that I had enough equity to not only insure the cab, I could, given the cab medallion market at that time, buy another medallion and car. With the two-cab setup, one would always be on the road. I was *saved!*. I was having a self-congratulatory beer and pinball game when the barman called out my name. I had a call. It was the cab dispatch office. My then-girlfriend had run a stop sign driving my cab and T-boned a car. I was done. Lost my equity, everything. I went from being an employer to an employee in three seconds.

Found a woman who wanted me for me, smart, principled, sexy,- got married, drank a bunch and then quit together, had a baby girl, bought a house, custom pickup, minivan, three dogs, and managed fifteen good years. And then first her workplace, then mine, conspired to fire us. The Dept. of Unemployment Assistance adjuster agreed with me and no one else showed at the hearing, so I won. My Bride won her unlawful dismissal by way of hostile workplace suit. But we still lost the house, truck, perfect credit rating, all our savings, fenced (at our $7000.00 expense) yard, above-ground pool and deck I built, ~20k worth of landscaping...and then the Government and the banks conspired to break the law, and re-write the law because the robo-signing of all the foreclosures was illegal, and would have essentially invalidated the process. So the banks had the congress pass a law retroactively shielding the banks from lawsuits.
Five million, nine hundred thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine other homes were likewise stolen.

As we're actually moving out, we lose the moving van and crew because no checks. I had one sixteen-year old boy, my daughter's boyfriend, and me, to move a three-person household. And my Bride, who has filled out seven separate sets of mortgage application papers over the previous two years at the request of motherless droids at the place that rhymes with Mel's Cargo, is sitting in the middle of the empty living room, sorting colored pens and markers. I ask, ""Honey, don't you think there's a better use for your skills than that?"" and she replies, ""Well, if I don't manage them here, I'll just end up managing them on the other end"". That's when I realized that her diagnosis of ADD-I(nattentive) actually had *teeth*. The thirty straight hours of moving was an experience I am no longer capable of.

We move into the new place, I'm working. Huge fights, she is so shattered by losing the house that she has to blame me, and as a result is lashing out constantly. I move into the attic. Run multiple extension cords, built a room with insulation and wood that we had been forced to move to the new place. Did everything but sleep up there for about six months.  I get injured on the job, and everything gets bollixed up at the start, leading to prolonged lack of income. After rehab, I'm done working. 100% disability retirement. At 61.

Years later, my bride's memory is malfunctioning. She described one aspect of the change she has experienced. She can look at the clock in the car and realize that the bank is closing now, and she's 5 minutes away. ""I can still make it"", she thinks, and continues on. Any kind of stress eliminates competent decision-making. Her personality has gradually acquired a more juvenile aspect. Doing an hour's worth of errands takes her four-five hours. Four stops within two miles, grocery, drug store, etc. The apartment (as did the house during the last year) looks well on the way to ""Hoarders"" territory. We have been headed for a split for about a year. 

In May I got around to doing the bloodwork I was supposed to have drawn last November. Something abnormal, Primary sends me to a urologist. Biopsy. Prostate cancer. Slow-moving. Treatable. Except mine's a little ""hot"", and has already metastasized into the seminal vesicles. MRIs, CT scans. Radiation incoming. No chemo. Yet.

59,"Recently I got out of a 4 year relationship, im 22 now and a single father. When my ex broke up with me I was devastated, i loved and i still love her but I know we have no future together, she said she wasted her life with me which is kinda true, she was 17 when we got together, and would rather smoke weed with me everyday than go do anything with her life, and I was the same. It all changed when she got pregnant and we decided to keep it, we got an apartment i started working more and smoking less, but for her nothing changed. When our daughter was born she had cannabis in her system and she had to stay in the hospital for 2 weeks, i was broken, i knew it was my fault because I failed to quit myself and my ex wouldnt even consider it. After my baby got out of hospital we were so happy, but of course that didnt last long, she soon got diagnosed with depression and didnt want to treat it, she kept saying i should support her and i should do more... i did everything, cleaned the bottles, fed the baby, put her to sleep l, wake up when she started crying in the night, i cleaned, I cooked and I worked at the same time while she did nothing around her, i never pointed it out or made a fight out of it, i knew she was going true hard times and I just wanted to make it easier on her. Once her maternity leave finished she went back to work. And from then she seemed genuinely happy. Soon I found out why, she was seeing some guy from work, it hurt me like nothing before, I screamed at her, i called her horrible things but in reality I still love her so much. Despite everything she did to me she was still the mother of my child and my first real love. Now she moved out somewhere with the new guy and i moved to my mothers with my daughter. One thing I realized in all this, is that in the 4 years of that relationship I never done anything with myself, i have no ambitions, no plans , no hobbies and I just feel like im super boring.  I feel lost and alone.  Recently I started working out, i was always quite fit but I can feel myself getting stronger with each workout. I want to find a hobby but i dont even know what interests me anymore.

60,"I enjoy being at work more than I enjoy having my own time.
I'm a 24M living in rural Australia. I work in a technical mechanical field. I work with a really great group of people and I always find it hard to relate when my friends/family/acquaintances complain about their jobs and coworkers making their lives suck. My work is basically my life, the majority of my purpose and self worth comes from my job. But outside of work I have really no hobbies or interests that I put time into. Growing up I always had very good grades and was in advanced learning programs and such during high school but always got in a lot of trouble with teachers and law enforcement. I'm a recovered meth addict (nearly 4 years), and have struggled with alcoholism most of the time since but never let it effect my work life, nobody at my work place is aware of this (some of my workmates know I drink a fair bit but the alcohol culture here is strong and nobody as far as I'm aware really views me as having a problem). After work and on the weekends I pretty much just write myself off on alcohol and  listen to music or watch movies. My co-workers all have lots of hobbies and other interests like sports, fishing, camping etc.
I feel awkward when we talk about plans for the weekend and they all have things to do while my plans are pretty much get drunk and wash my work clothes at some point before Monday. Should I aim to have more hobbies? Is it bad that my life is based around my job?",20Sep2019,1
61,"So the other day as I was doing that dreadful task known as the laundry (like seriously it’s like glitter and std’s, it just never goes away), the handle on my laundry basket broke and I was so mad! The little heifer had gone through so much and I didn’t think it could take anymore duct tape. We have two laundry baskets, both $1.50 from Walmart, and while they’ve held up for quite a good while, they were nearing the end of their useful lives, just like the Eskimos did with their elderly, it was time to put them on an iceberg and push them out to sea. But I REALLY didn’t want to have to buy more laundry baskets. We’re a middle/lower middle class family (not complaining, we have a great life and the things we need, there’s just often a little TOO much month at the end of the pay check. I’m sure many people can relate), and I would much rather splurge on a delicious snack than buy laundry baskets (priorities, right?). Anywho, a few days later I was at the store picking up a couple of things for my son and we passed the laundry basket aisle. So I sighed and went and picked up two more of the flimsy $1.50 baskets and went on our way. But then I happened by the cleanse section, and there they were, beautiful, sturdy, BIG laundry baskets for more than half off!! Four reinforced handles, hard plastics, and did I mention there were FOUR reinforced handles!?! Like I heard angels singing. So I got two of the sturdy baskets and left the flimsy ones with their superior brothers (I know, I’m a bad person. I apologize to retail workers everywhere), and mentally skipped happily to checkout (i can’t skip physically because I’m dealing with a chronic annoyingly excessively pain causing mystery illness right now and skipping would just hurt too much, but it’s the thought that counts, right?). And now I have two laundry baskets that are twice as sturdy, twice as big, so I can fit twice the amount of laundry, so I can procrastinate TWICE as long! Huzzah!! I honestly never thought a laundry basket could make me so happy inside. It’s the little things in life, right?",20Sep2019,3
62,"So first let me explain myself, just note that none of this is an excuse. Growing up I was never loved, my father died when I was 6 and my mother fell into a deep depression because of it, literally never showing me love. When I was molested at 5 she beat me, when I came out as gay she denied me, at every point when she needed to be a mother she wasn’t. Well let’s get into my teen years, Ive always suffered from depression but because I was in school the routine kept me sane. But after highschool when I was supposed to keep soaring and achieving, I fell flat. Now in highschool I fell madly in love with a guy, and we’ve been together for 3-4 years he’s honestly an angel but I don’t feel loved by him or anyone for that matter. He doesn’t touch me or even look at me. He says he does love me but I never feel it, maybe it’s something within me or maybe he isn’t loving me enough, I genuinely don’t know. So because I don’t feel loved, I have this void and I seek to fill it with men that will love me, not just sexually but emotionally and mentally. So I cheat, and I know it’s wrong. I don’t want to hide it from him so I just tell him right afterwards, because me as a person I knows it’s wrong, but in the moment when I need love it’s nothing but right. I don’t know what to do or how to do anything anymore at one point. I was high in my class, good grades, friends, goals and dreams, but now I just exist to wake up play video games maybe eat then depression sleep.

I don't believe in God, but I dislike calling myself an atheist because it straight away brings to mind arrogant people like Dawkins. I think there's great value and joy in religion done right.

65,"Being depressed always seemed cool and apparently its the in thing  right now. Sorry if the following is incoherent, I dont have the energy to go over it.

Since I moved to university away from home, I’ve been fucking lonely. Basically main causes  are separated by the ones I really hold dear (apparently you don;t  realise until its too late). Im talking about my family, my close circle  of friends, Its funny really when I’m surrounded by those I care about I  prefer being left alone but then, when Im separated by them, I miss  them a lot

You know I fucking saw this slow breakdown happening a mile  away,  its gonna happen, the climax is gonna hit one day, its about how much I  can hold it back day in day out. I do have friends here and shit but  then IDK I still wake up feeling up like this. I think another big cause  is the lifestyle change and me NOT being able to live the way I want. I  fucking love to procrastinate as we all do but when someone ELSE is  being inefficient with MY time, it really gets on my nerves.

NO, I dont want to wait for the bus, I fucking hate commuting, every  damn jouney requires some sort of planning, even Uber takes a while, if I  had a damn car to drive with and easy access to parking it’ll solve a  decent amount of woes I reckon’. But then as I go back to the old ways,  I’m pretty sure I’ll end up like this again,

Its either me being too busy to process me being sad or me having too  much fun with everyone to realise the truth. Some foundation in me is  not really a foundation at all, I dont feel GENUINELY happy. I always  float in the circumstances, chained to my environment, happy as the wind  blows, sad as the oceans rumble. 

I think my parents did a pretty good job raising me but apparently  I’m missing some sort of inner strength here, I look totally functional  on the outside, but the inside is getting darker by the second. I’m  doing all the things that objectively seem to make sense: prioritising my studies, solid amount of gym, trying to be as social as my  anti-social self allows, dont smoke or drink.

MY physics lec said “no smooth sea made a smooth sailor”; I can only  hope that is the case, and I’ll learn how to manage myself better in the  future. Maybe I need to start relying on God. But that just seems like  another crutch, another band aid, how do I achieve this true inner sense  of wellbeing I wonder???????

I dont want pity, but if you’re going through similar circumstances  or feelings, knowing how you’re coping would make me feel better I  believe. M’yes. No I’m not suicidal or anything but this certainly  doesn’t seem like a good road to go down on. The apathy is setting in…..",20Sep2019,1

The worst part is I know that this is my fault, I could have pulled through the last time i lost weight, I could have stopped avoiding social events and maybe even met someone nice. I could have done better in so many ways yet I didn't. Is this really just me? Am I always going to be like this? I've told myself so many times that I'll change, that I'll do this and that different, but I'm just all words, no real action to be seen. I don't want to be like this, I don't want to be myself, but I know I'm not going to change and that just makes it worse.

74,"I started this job about 6 months ago, and the learning curve is very steep.  Recently she sat me down in the office and started criticizing the way I do something too slowly.  She went on to criticize no less than 6 different critical aspects of my job performance over the course of an hour.  I tried to be respectful and come up with solutions for how I could try harder, but by the end I was near tears.  I went home and cried for 2 hours.  

She has never said anything encouraging to me like “you’re doing a good job with X.”  In fact, the only time I’ve ever heard her compliment anyone was a backhanded compliment when she was criticizing me for not doing X but said that (other coworker) has been doing a good job, thank you.  

If she was the only person I had been working with, I probably would have given up as hopeless and quit.  However, I work with other employees and a former employee who all say she is like that, always negative.  And I’ve had the joy of working with substitutes when she was gone, who encouraged me and said I was doing a good job, especially for how new I am.

The thing is, it has really hit my self esteem.  I can’t stop thinking about it.  I know she is watching over my shoulder and mentally calculating every single mistake I make.  I know it will only be a matter of time before she brings all my failures to task and demands me to do better for every single mistake.  I have no desire to work hard for someone who is so caustic.

The internet speed is still 4G which is just as fast as my phone. The menu navigates just as fast. Other than the better camera (which I don't take photos anyway), the water resistance and the added security (which is redundant because my pattern lock is almost impossible to memorize) there's no added benefit. The screen resolution is redundant too just due to the size of the display. You don't need anything higher than 720p on a display that size. The difference in image quality is marginal.

Problem is that many people do not use the product's name in their video so how are people supposed to find it!?  Man I HATE that. And there are many products that are similar so by searching what I call ""side words"" you end up having to dig through all the video results that are similar but not the exact product. 

Like for example you want to look up info on compact appliances generally for dorm rooms/RVs/small apartments. So you search the  name brand.... and you find those because they are easy, then to dig deeper you search for the specific applainces name (not brand name, but what it is called), then you find some that way, then to go deeper you search using words describing what the appliance does (cooks) and where (RVs,dorm rooms,small apartments).

We have no way of knowing that when we die. We know nothing once we die. If we have been remembered. If we made a difference. If we wasted our time on earth.

87,"Do you know that saying ""you don't know what you have until it's gone?"" well, I am currently experiencing this. A few months ago, I met an amazing person online. Despite the fact that all we've ever done is text, I found myself quickly trusting him and enjoying our conversations. We could talk for hours, and I wouldn't even notice. He would send me all of these funny memes and cute animal pictures, just to make my day a little bit better. Everything was great.

That was until I started going through a rough patch emotionally. My anxiety was at an all-time high, and I began to become afraid that I would lose him. So, I did the worst possible thing and started to act a bit crazy. I kept accusing him of not wanting to talk to me, of trying to ghost. Two or three times, when I was having a panic attack,  I told him I didn't want to talk anymore, only to go back and apologize - begging for him to come back. I was so afraid of getting hurt, that I was pushing away an amazing person.

Each and every time I would freak out on him, he'd forgive me. Promise to do better...but over time, he started to do what I always feared. He started to pull away

Messages that once took an hour tops to respond to, would not get a response for 5 or 6 hours, or even worse we wouldn't even talk for a day or two. Our conversations started to fall flat. He stopped sending me things that reminded him of me. A few days ago, it occurred to me that it had been a while since we actually had a conversation where it didn't end with me just saying goodnight because I didn't get a response for hours and it was getting late. 

At that moment, I realized how much I missed him. I missed our weird inside jokes and our random gifs. I missed when we were closer. Then, I realized something else. Somewhere between my craziness, and him pulling away I had fallen really really hard for him. Maybe that's part of the reason why I acted so crazy. I wanted us to be more, but I just mentally couldn't work out how we could be together so I tabled my feelings. I tabled them for so long that he moved on and now we're barely even friends. Sure, I could tell him how I feel...but would it even accomplish anything? I think it's better to just let him go live his life. Maybe find someone who will realize how awesome he is from the very beginning, instead of when it's already too late to even have a friendship.",20Sep2019,1

91,"In the last two months I've severed quite a few relationships and I don't know if I'm being reasonable at all.

I just finished university and as you would expect, I lost sight of quite a few people who were around quite often while I was doing my degree.

I've bluntly told two friends to forget about me as they were being very dodgy about making plans and cancelling last minute every. Single. Time. I literally told them ""lets not pretend like we want to see each other then, have good one and good luck"". They then answered with protests saying things like ""wow what are you talking about, what are you even saying"". But then again, they didn't really fight to keep the relation alive from what I can see.

I was dating this girl who after a week of slowly texting less and less told me she didn't feel like she liked me as much as she thought she would. I told her it wasn't a problem, these things happens, I told to never change and she was great and I had fun while it lasted. She followed by ""maybe we won't go on an other date, but we can still hangout will our mutual friends!"" To which I answered that i'd rather stop any contact as it wouldn't be moving on. We haven't spoken since and I honestly don't plan on talking to her again. My last message was literally a ""good luck and hope everything goes well in your life""

I can feel my level of tolerance slowly fade away as I'm becoming more and more reactive to bullshit. 

The event that prompt me to write this post happened a few minutes ago. A long time university friend (4 years) invited me to her place tonight. She said she was throwing a small gathering. When I asked who would be there she was being dodgy which didn't bother me. Answering with sentences like ""some people"". I told a few jokes and dug a bit more, she then sent a message saying ""honestly I don't feel like doing this"" (this being joking around by text) followed by ""anyways, you can come at 9pm"".

My instant reaction was to type ""nah i'm good, see you some other time"" as her attitude irritated me. If you're busy say it. Be considerate. I stopped myself and wondered if I was being reckless. Part of me thinks I'm being overly sensitive by the way people are responding to me. Part of me also thinks there's such a thing as respect.

So there you have it, I have no clue if I'm in the right subreddit.

Am I being reckless? Have anyone went through a phase were they bluntly cut ties with multiple people over a month or two? Am I being sensitive or am I being too blunt?

I've always been told that I am straightforward and quite blunt. But even for me this is a bit new.

TL;DR : I'm destroying relationships due to the way people respond to me.

Too many cancellation, not enough motivation to see me, lack of romantic interest and finally, lack of tact while talking. 

Am I reasonable or not? Is this a telltale sign of something else?",20Sep2019,1

Years later, the kidney was rejected and went septic. At this time, my Dad had to go back in dialysis, and as an older person, had so many complications come with it. 

Veins wouldn’t take IVs anymore. Pain meds became a daily occurrence. His mobility suffered greatly. Near the end, the constant pain, the hospital visits, the medicine, the procedures... all of it was, understandably, so fucking difficult.

The more years passed, the more normal things became and the cadence of visits became lesser (family, work, life... it all adds up). I would still visit and send letters and food to him and surprises... but I never went back for a long or extended period of time. 

I just can’t help but think if I did that, would I have seen something different, or would he have felt more supported? The chances are he’d have told me to “stop being a sunnova bitch and don’t worry” (again, his words not mine) and I would have went back home with my wife.

I usually drive with my grandma and this was no exception. I saw the light turn green and asked do I go? and my grandma responded with no it’s a red light but it was green! We were both confused because the lights were in a really awkward position that could’ve been for both parties and we were both looking at 2 different lights. So she kept screaming at me and I kept screaming at her whether or not it’s my turn to go and the ambulance behind me started honking its horn at me but I had no Idea what to do. This went on for 2 or 3 lights and I kept telling my grandma that the ambulance behind us was honking at me to go but she kept saying the lights not green! So at the 3rd light I got overwhelmed and freaked out and just turned right! but I’m pretty sure I turned right wrong because to turn right you had to go straight as shown by the white dotted lines but I was too freaked out to turn and ended up making an illegal turn regardless. By the way the intersection was this weird X and the ambulance didn’t have its lights on so I don’t think it was an emergency but I still feel really guilty and I keep thinking about it.,20Sep2019,8

I bought one but the guy I bought it off was taking a couple weeks to get it all ready for me, getting it MOT'D, serviced but it was all taking too long for her so I got the money back and went and bought this piece of shit for £100 more than what I originally paid for the first car. From day 1 I was driving it around illegally and I didn't even know, granted thats my fault for not double checking but I've had so much going on.

I was driving to work one day and the car fills up with smoke from the engine and it nearly suffocates me as i was driving. So I found an oil leak but I'm only 22 I'm broke and to save money I fixed it myself with the help of my dad. We needed a new oil filter. Got that all working and then the battery died, okay so get a new battery, now all seems well then I get a flat tyre the next fucking day. Right, get a new tyre and now this tonight

You're probably reading this and thinking im over reacting with the title but I've been dealing with lots of trauma and mental health issues the past year. I helped my ex as much as I could but in the meantime got so burnt out helping her that my own mental health deteriorated. 

She had some terrible things happen to her before which caused PTSD, I tried caring for her but maybe I didn't go about it the best way. It got to the point where she never did anything for herself. We moved in and I was working and going to university at the time, all while she was recovering. She didn't have anything to do during the day I said she could go volunteer somewhere or go to college but no she stayed in the house for months. Never really cleaned up behind herself to the point the kitchen was pretty much out of use. Now I would try but I was so poor in providing for her off a student loan and 9 hour a week job that I was only eating 1 meal a day for the longest time. So I'd get home late most nights exhausted and starving and the house would be even messier than it was when i left in the morning. It got to the point she'd only want to eat takeouts all the time for every meal because she was too unwell to cook or clean. I did cook and clean sometimes but she was in the house all day every day and would just make a fucking mess of everything so quickly. Whenever I cleaned the house it would be disgusting within a day again.

Fast forward a bit she joined college and said she needed a break from the relationship. I had no money and we lived together. She said that I could stay there for the time being. Within a couple days she was on tinder sending nudes to guys and she went and met up with a guy from there but told me nothing happened and yeah she met up with her abusive ex boyfriend behind my back 3 times. We were literally dealing with police and the courts to get a restraining order on this guy. He threatened to kill me and then I found out they were meeting and keeping it from me???

During the break my best friend asked if I wanted to move in with him. I was in this weird loop of trying to provide for my ex and I didn't want to upset her (dumb) but I said maybe. I spoke to her about the offer and she said it was a good idea. About a week before I move in she wants to get back together with me and I said yes. (Now I know now that was a bad idea but the past year of my life I've been fed lies and stories to make me feel sorry for her. I fucked up... ) Once I move in she gives me constant hassle about moving away from her even though the only reason I did move was because she said it was a good idea. If at the time she said no I wouldn't have went through with it. That's how much she controlled me.

Surprisingly to everybody we broke up after about 2 months again because an argument  (which was her telling me how shit I am and me apologising until i would get upset and retort). I tried to leave her house, she said she wanted to break up and I was to get out of her house. I put my shoes on and she said no no stay i need you.

 I stayed. 

That happened two more times in the night and i eventually said fuck it I'm leaving which she then proceeded to block the doorway out and wouldn't let me leave. I just kept repeating please let me leave over and over again I didn't stop saying that. Then she came and tried to pin me to the ground then I just ran straight out the door.


Now fast forward I'm living with my best friend we moved into a flat together in another town and the only thing keeping me going is that I'd feel bad if I did kill myself that he would have to deal with the rent and bills himself. I don't want to put that on him. I know it's over between me and her and I do not want to go back to her but I still feel guilt for some reason. I can't justify why, I may have sometimes been a bit of an asshole but she was next level abusive but for some reason I feel so guilty and I can't stop thinking about all this shit and I just feel so alone. 

Sorry for dumping all this I feel like I'll probably delete this post soon but I just need to know I'm not crazy here. My head has been absolutely fucked for a while and I can't tell if this is my fault i feel this way or not.",20Sep2019,2
108,"I have zero friends, I’m alone pretty much all of the time, I drive without a license, and I’ve been unemployed for a year and a half. 

I’ve tried getting a job, but I really can’t stand the idea.. I have had two, and I quit both after three shifts. I’m ashamed to admit that but it’s true. 

I don’t know what I want to do. I just feel like crying whenever I think about how much of a loser I am. I really have no direction and I want nothing more than to normal for a change. 

And the constant loneliness hurts. I’ve tried to make friends but it doesn’t happen. I feel like everyone wants to just make fun of me because of my shy aura. 

I’d love someone my age to chat to and to feel like an actual human being with. 

I’ve been depressed for a while. I have no motivation. I think I have some undiagnosed condition. I feel like an alien trapped in a vessel. 

And I have nightmarish states sleep paralysis ever since I found a suicide victim in the woods. After I quit college and cut myself out. I didn’t think I was hurt by that at the time, but now I’m feeling the effects to my mental health. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t have a friend in the world to talk to.",20Sep2019,1
109,"I’m in my first relationship since high school and I just really don’t know how to be in one. For me, all of college was about having fun and not really trying to date seriously so I generally would hook up with guys that I had no emotional attachment too. 
At the same time I would “date” guys that I wasn’t physically attracted to at all to still get that emotional support. I know it wasn’t the best situation for me or any of them, I was kind of a wreck. 

Now I’m seeing this guy and I really like him and could see myself loving him but I cant get over my approach to relationships. If we have sex or things are going in that direction, I completely emotionally detach. The sex is amazing and super hot but I don’t really want to be near him afterwards like he wants to cuddle or hold hands for a while after and I do it because I know it makes him feel good but I feel so uncomfortable and not at all attracted to him in the moment, like I’m trying to leave a one night stands place at night and he’s cuddling with me. 

On the other hand, when we are having emotional conversations and talking about deep things or even cuddling or holding hands outside of sex, I can’t think of him in a sexual way. 

Basically, to me, these things (an emotional connection and sex) have always been separate and I’m having a hard time in this relationship because I can’t like join them together. Do you guys have any advice? 

tl;dr - I have a habit of separating sex and emotional connections and I’m afraid my relationship will fail because of it. Help!",20Sep2019,1

Currently I took a break from work to get my engineering degree in the field I was working in. I still have status in my field and there are still people asking me about all kinds of stuff. The interesting thing is: the more I learn the less it concerns me to say ""I dont know about that""

But like a month or so ago after I was able to kill the man in my walls,  I woke up floating on my back in our pool, as my sister was pulling me out(right then I was baptized).  After a few hours she decided to take me to a psych ward which I stayed in for like a month.  I decided not to eat any of the food because I knew that satan was tempting me with food(cause the nurses would try and get me to eat).  I would only drink water, and would have frequent black outs and “fuzzy moments” where it was like I was black out drunk, and cravings so hard that it felt like my stomach would split open.  See writing this down it sounds retarded, but when it was happening it felt like all the pieces of the puzzle in my head was put together.  So I went to the Vatican, then I went to Brazil to meditate under a waterfall, for a few days. I found what I was looking for there and like half of me was torn away and replaced with a deity",20Sep2019,1

119,"What did Israel ever really do?  
Why does Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, or any other country give so much of a shit about what someone's religion is?  
Why do so many people there care if someone is gay, or straight or bi?  
Why do they treat women like shit? Like they are nothing more than servants to give birth to their children?

I say, if we got rid of those 3 major countries and any country that was on the extremist side in the world, like what was that country in Africa that was being a dick to another? Not allowing freedom of speech to the point that Facebook said ""here's an Onion link to facebook through tor."" What does that tell you?

120,"I am sick of being below average in everything. Everyone has higher grades than me and extracurriculars and somehow can get a better grade than I do. I work hard and have more studying time (due to physical disability and my own pickiness making extracurriculars boring or painful) yet don’t get their grades. And I don’t want to hear that bullshit where they say that maybe I have bad grades and am truly smart like those dropouts from school who failed but secretly are smarter. I have a shitty GPA, but I try my hardest and don’t cause trouble. And my standardized testing score is SHIT. It is terrible and below average. All fucking 17 year olds (born 2002, I am born 2001) have fucking AP classes, can socialize, aren’t boring to others, have a 130+ IQ, and tell me it’s my fault for being distracted. I HAVE FUCKING SENSORY PROCESSING DISORDER AND STRUGGLE TO FILTER STUFF OUT. I already had sensory therapy and try my best to focus on my own stuff BUT IT IS HARD WHEN THAT SMARTASS WHO DOESN’T NEED TO LISTEN IS WHISPERING AND IT SOUNDS LIKE A SPEAKER TO YOU. Damn earplugs don’t work. Headphones isolate the sound too much to the point I can’t hear the teacher or speaker. I can’t filter out moving things in the corner of my eyes, screaming, certain sounds, hate changes like my fucking birthday weekend now being shifted from the weekend before my birthday to AFTER because two fucking friends of my parents are coming over. I hate changes. I fucking hate this.

SHUT THE FUCK UP IF YOU ARE SIDE CONVERSING, DISTRACTING THE TEACHER, OR FREAKING OUT WITH YOUR FRIENDS. I CAN’T FOCUS AND NOT EVERYONE IS AS FUCKING SMART AS YOU. FUCK ALL OF YOU HIGH SCHOOLERS. I AM ACCOMMODATING MYSELF AND EVEN WITH MY MEDICATION BEING UPPED YOU SHITHOLES MAKE ME HAVE MELTDOWNS DAILY BECAUSE OF HOW LOUD AND DISTRACTING YOU ARE.

I am so fucking lonely. No one wants to talk about psychology, pokémon, tardigrades, neuroscience, philosophy, etc with me at my school. ALL YOU FUCKING SAY IS “cool” or “okay.” THEN I AM SAID TO HAVE ATYPICAL THINKING, NICHE INTERESTS, AND AM SOCIALLY UNAWARE OR RUDE. I TRIED SO HARD TO FIT IN BUT ALSO BE MYSELF AND IT DIDN’T WORK. THIS YEAR I AM MYSELF. DOESN’T WORK. WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT? AM I A RETARD TO YOU? I hate that fucking word, but a few months ago I was told I could be on the spectrum and I already have a huge medical history and toxic personality to people/doctors. I am tired of trying to smile, force myself to be polite, and all of this.

I studied the wrong section for my anatomy class THREE times out of four. The teacher says it’s on the calendar and shit and I am here seeing it now yet didn’t a week beforehand.

Then I study for three hours on math every single damn night (except tonight because I honestly am in such a shitty mood). And I get a C- on my fucking test.

And I was born deformed and abandoned as a damn baby with disabilities and had 17 surgeries and three sets of braces. Fuck this.

A few hours ago I was sobbing, shrieking, cursing, slamming my hand against the leather shotgun seat. And my hand was burning from that. And I was kicking like a toddler and punching it.

I AM NOT AVERAGE OR ABOVE AVERAGE IN ANY-FUCKING-THING. I CAN’T SOCIALIZE, HAVE BAD GRADES AND BAD TEST SCORE YET STUDY HARD FOR THEM,

I AM TRYING SO HARD TO BE HAPPY AND DETERMINED BUT JUST WANT TO KILL MYSELF BECAUSE I CAN’T DO SHIT. MY PERSONALITY IS TOXIC, MY GRADES ARE SHIT, MY EXTRACURRICULARS ARE NEARLY NONEXISTENT, MY BIRTH PARENTS DITCHED ME, I CAN’T ADD BASIC NUMBERS, I AM UGLY AS FUCK BECAUSE OF MY BIRTH PARENTS QUESTIONABLE HISTORY (unknown), AND EVERY DAMN PERSON YOUNGER THAN ME SEES ME AS OVERDRAMATIC OR A CHILD WHEN REALLY I AM BAD AT EXPRESSING MY NEGATIVE EMOTIONS AND CAN’T REGULATE THEM. FUCK. I have no positive attributes or anything good and clearly I deserve to die because of how fucking useless I am. You see inspirational younger people who make use of their hard situation then me, a baby who is crying and trying her damn hardest but keeps having things pile on top of her.

Fuck you all. Especially those who have a higher GPA than me and are younger and somehow have fucking friends yet I have none because I am apparently unpleasant, intense, rude, autistic, atypical, assholeish, impatient, mean, toxic, immature, strict, rigid, uptight, stern, just fuck off with your damn SAT score, GPA, AP classes, abled body, biological nurturing families, etc
