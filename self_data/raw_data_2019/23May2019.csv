7,"I dropped my wallet somewhere and mobody's turned it in. It's not about the money. I didn't have too much cash and can freeze the cards. But there were some things in that wallet I can't get back.

There was a metro card from last year's cherry blossom festival, printed with pink trees on the waterfront and warped from the heat of the car, that I bought on the day of my graduation. It was the only happy thing about that day.

There was a gift card I got as a present for my birthday from a friend's mom who I barely thought knew I existed to celebrate my 18th. It reminfed me that people do care even if I can't see them.

There was a small piece of foreign currency, 10 manat, that may be the last thing my grandma gives me.

To whoever stole an 18 year old's wallet for the $20 in it: was it worth it? Are you happy? Do you feel all warm and fuzzy inside having taken so much for so little money?",23May2019,2
8,"NEET stands for Not in Education, Employment, or Training.

If you find yourself in a spell of unemployment, are a young adult who just dropped out of high school or college, someone who is lost in life, or even someone who has been a NEET for a long time, don't come to /r/NEET seeking any form of life improvement.

If I had to make a comparison, the community of /r/NEET would be the work equivalent of Incels - the former, for whatever reason, get lost in the cracks of society and have now developed a hatred for working people (e.g., calling them ""wage cucks""), just as incels develop a hatred for women for relationship problems (or lack thereof).

When you seek out a community for support with life problems, it's important that the community fosters a healthy outlook on life. With /r/NEET, many of the posters advocate for lifelong unemployment, with the concept of ""NEETbux"" being given to them by the government or the people around them. This outlook on life is unhealthy as it not only encourages dependency on others, but further hampers the development of self-confidence and dignity.

There are a few posts in the subreddit that are positive and show an outlook toward a healthy future, but they are sparse and not representative of the subreddit as a whole. Most posts are negative and have explicit hints toward defeatism. While it's good to have people you can relate with, I feel like NEETdom is one of those things where it's unhealthy to be around people like you. Of course, a lot of the posters have people in their lives who are not like them but who have enabled them to be this way, so I am not sure if there is a definitively better community for sharing experiences without the negativity.

To be clear, I am a NEET myself. However, I feel as if over the years, lurking in /r/NEET may have subconsciously affected my ability to look at things positively and get out of my rabbit hole. On one occasion, I took a look through numerous posters' Reddit histories. I found that they also frequented hate subreddits (that I don't really care to list here) and found myself rethinking each and every post I might have came across, wondering if they might have had misogynistic or racist undertones.",23May2019,5

I found out about everything last monday, and tried to help him, even when i didn't exactly know how. Today he was going to meet a psychologist at our university, and he asked me to go there with him, and asked the psychologist if i could stay there while they talked. It was a weird experience, but I'm so happy i can be of any help, he said talking was way easier with me there. I'm happy he's doing alright.

10,"Just copying from r/advice

I figured this sub would give me a lot better answers and discussion than I got on r/gradadmissions , r/casualconversation and r/gradschool. I‚Äôve got into both of my dream schools after 3 denials from each in undergrad and their film schools this year. I‚Äôm over the moon. However, now it‚Äôs time to decide where I‚Äôll be for the next two years.

**what do you want to do in life?**

I wanna go into politics longterm and work with the UN, helping build schools overseas and in developing countries for poor kids. My cousin does consulting work with the UN and runs schools in Colombia, Nigeria and a few other places. I wanna do similar stuff. I‚Äôd also like to obtain my PhD and lecture at my alma mater(Glasgow uni)

**Go with whoever offers the most money**

USC only has like 5 scholarships for the MPA and I didn‚Äôt get any of them, I am applying for the Norman Topping one which is for graduate students in general though, haven‚Äôt submitted yet. It‚Äôs 25k a year I believe based on what a lady in the financial aid office sent me yesterday

NYU is pretty much same thing, NYU is notorious for not offering financial aid and charging their students high amounts of money, it is what it is. NYU has the pro‚Äôs of offering a more international geared degree which is my preference because I want to work internationally and have an international degree already. There‚Äôs also the PhD in IR which is the terminal degree for the field.

USC has of course, better weather, a friendlier atmosphere, MPA seems to have more options available and is obviously a very in demand degree, we‚Äôll always need administrators, policy makers, planners, government consultants, etc. I‚Äôm giving myself until the end of this week to make a decision so I can start planning my summer trips and autumn stuff as well. I feel like you really can‚Äôt go wrong with either as they‚Äôre both prestigious uni‚Äôs and highly ranked programmes(Sol price is #3 for public policy) with advantages to both. 

I‚Äôd really appreciate some help on this or if anyone has done either before, what were your thoughts?",23May2019,0

That'll never wash out. must've been from when she got a glimpse of Kagan's panties and started getting horny.

She produces a tampon from her purse and inserts it with a kind of ecstasy. She loves that feeling. The dry cotton inside her wet cervix is so titillating she shivers.

Then, she begins stimulating her clit. Her cunt is dripping wet at this point and she's started grabbing at her tits to stimulate her nipples

12,"I am a 16 and a half year old male. I'm in the 10th grade, and I attend school near Richmond, Virginia. As of late, my life has started to quickly derail. At home, my mom and dad constantly fight and they are never home. Ever since my dad has found out he has type-2 diabetes, he has seemed like a different person. It was only a few months ago, but it seemed like he changed almost instantly. My mom and dad have never really seen eye-to-eye on anything, but they have really been vocal about it lately. They have started to work different hours so they don't have to be at home with each other. This results in me getting home from school at 4 PM and being home alone by myself until around 6-8PM every weekday. On the weekends, my mom doesn't work, which basically means it's a scream-a-thon between my mom and dad over every small detail. My sister is in college, and she seems like a total mess. She's really been the only person I've been able to talk to about my mom and dad, and we both think they will be divorced by the time I leave for college. My sister, however, may or may not be a druggie. She got high in my living room and she couldn't drive me to Target so I could pick my reserved copy of Smash Bros.. She claims her and her roommate grow weed in their dorms, but I haven't seen any proof of it. She used to post pictures of her smoking and drinking all over snapchat, which is a great reason why I barely use it anymore. I also have a brother who is two years younger than me. According to my parents, he is one of, if not, the best swimmer for his age in the state of Virginia. He is constantly at swim practice every day after school, and since my dad likes to take his time picking him up, I also never see him, too. The only time we are at home together is weekend mornings and nights. Honestly, I hate coming home after school. My school life is absolutely atrocious(we'll get to that later), but sometimes, it just hurts to come home and rot away in my room for hours on end. I'm supposed to get my driver's license in the beginning of June so I can work at my summer job, but my dad doesn't like me working there, so he has stopped driving with me. He wants to stop me from getting my license so I don't have to work there. That makes me feel like a piece of shit(excuse my language). For me, I hate being at home. But my school life sucks even more.

&amp;#x200B;

I go to a high school somewhere near Richmond, Virginia. I'm in the 10th grade. Personally, I had a good time in 9th grade. I was having a good time this year, but something happened. Now: I take pretty advanced classes for my grade. I am a math ahead and take smart-kid math and history. In ninth grade, I was in classes with dumb kids that I hated being around, so I took Geometry over the summer. It was the best decision I ever made. I also play volleyball and basketball for my school. So...about my incident...there's a kid at school that everyone knows the name of. His made-up name is Chuck. Everyone knows and loves Chuck. He's cool with the jocks, the rednecks and the nerds at my school. Even the teachers, school staff, and coaches all know and love this kid. I used to be very close friends with him and all of the other kids he generally hung out with. If there was a scale with ""Jock"" at one end and ""Nerd"" at one end, I would be dead in the middle. Chuck would be in the middle of ""Jock."" When I was friends with him, he would complain to me that every girl he tries to get with friend zones him. A few weeks ago, I found out why. I started to pay attention to the things he says, and I realized that he's kind of a asshole. He makes extremely racist remarks and he makes jokes about women and people of color. He occasionally makes jokes about Jewish people to all of his friends, who finds him hilarious. The only reason he tries to date these girls is because he thinks they ""have a big butt"" or ""they're thick"". I understand all teenagers talk like this, and I was no exception. I stopped talking like this because I felt genuinely disgusted with myself. I stopped talking to these kids and started to break away from them. I now only have three real friends(I will talk about these boys later). Well, one day, me and three of my friends were playing GTA on our computers. Two of them were my friends and the other was some kid I didn't really know, but we were still cool. One of my good friends suggested we hade a ""Real talk"" with each other, where be basically ranted about how garbage our lives are. When it was my turn, I told them a few personal things that my parents don't even know about. I didn't tell them about my situation at home, but I told them some different things. I said that my mom was a social worker, and she thinks I have autism(I don't think this at all.) I also told them more personal things, but they were all okay about it. Well...the one kid I was on good terms with told another kid. And that kid told Chuck about the things I said. Chuck then proceeds to tell everyone he knows(almost everyone in the goddamn school) about the things I said. The worst part about it was how some of the stuff I didn't even do, and I could actually get in serious trouble if a teacher heard these things. According to Chuck and now everyone else in the school, I watch child porn, I'm a incel and I hate women, I stalk girls online, I have raging autism, I masturbate in the school bathrooms, I'm borderline a sex offender and I'm a pedophile. As you could assume, this didn't go down so well the next day. I had kids left and right asking me if I did all of that horrible stuff. I'm surprised a teacher hasn't heard about this, actually. And quite honestly, I want to tell someone about this, but I know how the staff at school basically worships Chuck like a god, and if I go in there and tell them this scenario, they're either gonna believe Chuck or they're gonna make the situation worse and basically spread these rumors even more. According to one of my old friends, every girl in the school thinks i'm a rapist and they are scared of me(I will touch on this later as well). Nobody except for my three friends wants to be around me anymore. All of my old friends(who I thought we were cool with) basically ignore me and have left me to dry. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another chapter of my horrible life is my own self. I'm around 6'2 and I weigh 195 pounds. This might sound good, but I look like a goblin. I'm serious. I have man boobs that stick a mile out from my chest and I have HORRIBLE back acne. My face acne is still pretty bad, but my back is basically just a mountain range of pus. I try to use back wash, but I think it made it worse. My parents nagged me to go to the gym, but they aren't ever home to take me. My dad does it the worst, and I think it's ironic that he wants me to go to the gym more often but he doesn't want me driving. So...I resorted to not eating breakfast, drinking two bottles of water for lunch and having a small dinner. I know it's stupid, but I am that desperate to lose weight in order to not look like a gremlin. Over the summer, I work at a concession stand at a pool. I have no idea why my dad hates it, but I don't think it's that bad. According to my sister, who was a manager there last year, nobody who worked there is coming back and the lifeguarding got sold to a company. The pool still manages the concession stand and the front gate, so a whole new wave of workers *should* be coming in. When I heard this, I was actually excited. I thought, ""Maybe everyone here will be around my age and they all don't go to my school. Maybe I can finally have more than three good friends and I can finally...maybe...get into the relationship life I always wanted to have."" The pool hasn't opened yet, but I'm actively trying to lose as much weight as I can and go to the gym more so I can have a good first impression. I'm trying to find a good form of back and face wash so I can look nice, too. Compared to last year, I have cleaned my act up significantly. I like to feel that way sometimes, but other times, my self-esteem has nose dived into a cliff. When I was a kid, I had plans to not get married and not have kids. I was gonna be rich and famous. I don't want that anymore. I want to have a wife and kids and I want to move as far away from all of this as I can. Unfortunately...my parent's don't have enough money after they spent $40,000 on college for my sister. We were always lower-middle class, but holy crap. It's actually my worst nightmare being stuck here. Most kids at my school are losers that aren't going anywhere, but I really, really want to leave. I can't stand living in Virginia. And if my parent's don't somehow get enough cash or I don't get a scholarship, I am gonna end up stuck in bumfuck Virginia(sorry for the strong language)...where everyone knows I'm something I'm not. I stay up all night and worry about this sometimes. I lose sleep over that thought. I feel like my life is spiraling out of control and I can barely try and improve it. My parents hate each other, I barely have anyone to talk to and everyone else thinks I am a horrible person. All of the girls don't even bother looking at me in the halls anymore. I feel like I've been tainted when I'm at school. Most of the reason why I'm cleaning my act up and losing weight is because I don't have anyone to talk to and I want a girlfriend that I can do just that to. Honestly, a part of me is happy that the girls are afraid of me and don't want to talk to me, because honestly, the girls at my school are about as bad as they get. Vaping in the bathrooms, doing drugs, not caring about schoolwork at all....I don't like that one bit. I find it unattractive as hell. I want someone that acts normal, looks about normal and isn't stupid. Which is nobody at my school. It's a shame really, because the person I just described is practically me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know this was extremely long, but it feels really good to vent out my problems like this. I really hope the train that is my life doesn't derail and goes back on track. I know I'll find someone eventually. I know everything will work out okay.

15,"My heartfelt goodbye

Saying goodbye to you, 

You that are always in my mind. As I am happy for you; as I am eager for your future; and as I am content with being your friend. The truth is all the words below are meaningless but necessary for me to say.

I am well over being heartbroken, in reality, I'm okay with how things turned out, doesn't mean I don't wish things had been better. 

A little part of me tells me that we were meant for each other, but I guess destiny had other plans in mind. Other people for us, and lives apart.

I still look back and picture things from another endpoint. All the promises that we made and the plans that were never fulfilled. And then I wonder, was it worth it?

Every time you left, every time you gave up, even if it was my fault, Do you think that was the best thing to do? when you said that you liked me before, a lot; that you were scared that I would I leave, I promise that in a million years I would've never done such a thing.

And even if I did have to leave, that doesn't mean it would have been over, as I would have done anything possible to be with you.

I missed you, a lot, so much that it was sickening; so bad that my heart stopped trusting the world, and so much loneliness my thoughts wander to obscure places.

To know your past and how much you have suffered, drowns me in angst. Then I wish I could be the one that reassures you day and night that everything is okay. 

It is hard to believe, trust me, it took me a minute to realize, but by the time I knew what I wanted, it was all too lost. 

The words that come out of my mind I understand how hard they are for you to believe, but when I say that I'm in love with you, I mean it. 

The fact is, I loved you, and deep down you knew it.  It sounds dumb, I know, I'm the one that says that love is built on with months, and years. But there is something about you, something enchanting, something powerful. The way you smile that brightened my day. Your sweet voice replying to my every thought, your eagerness to listen and be there for me. 

Your eyes

Your voice

Your courage

Your intelligence

Your sense of independence

And yes I admit it... your booty as well.

How you listen to me; how you trust my opinion; How you always come back; How you make me feel. And that if there is a God up there, he made you perfect, at least for me.

&amp;#x200B;

After all, I wish you the best. I am so joyful that you're in love with your boyfriend. You deserve love. I am grateful that things are looking better in your life, and I accept your decision of leaving one more time. 

You don't need me, and I don't need you. We're are capable of living wonderful lives. And we will.

All I ask from you is to stay true to your promise. That you won't give up. And though we're going separate ways, the thought of you leaving early this world is the most horrifying thing.

Be safe and look up high, you're one of the brightest persons I know, and I see so much grandeur in your future. I wonder where the universe will drive us but remember you'll always have a place wherever I'm at.

Keep fighting hard, you'll find meaning and a happy life.",23May2019,2

18,"I'm introverted and asocial, with a healthy (?) dose of ADHD and aspberger traits. Compound that with some anxiety and depression that while regulated, still are a thorn in my side from time to time.

I loved working visuals because it wasn't people focused and I got to decorate for work. Then a lot of our workers moved on to better jobs or quit. Being short staffed meant being a sales associate and a visual associate.

I thought I wouldn't handle it well but despite the odds I'm really thriving. It's not my first customer service job and while I've worked wholesale retail this is the first up close and retail sales experience in my life.

I'm actually really loving it. This is also the first job that I can say that I love working. I'm nine months in. The customer base, my coworkers and management are great. The work is easier every day that I'm more familiar with the products and function of the store. I want to hold onto this job for life I enjoy it that much. I have a 401k even though it's part time and I'd elfome full time. Plus the company discount will be great once I get around to building my own custom van for that sweet roadlife.

19,"I (F42) have this vision stuck in my head where humans are nothing but chimpanzees throwing shit at each other, some more than others.

It's become obvious to me that I have some trauma regarding close friends who projected their dysfunctions and bullshit onto me, then gaslighted me when I fought back, and when I was so confused I felt crazy. There was emotional, verbal, and even once, physical abuse. I've cut ties months ago with genuine feelings of repulsion at the thought of ever being in the same room as them.

I get used to being alone pretty fast. I don't feel helpless. But I also know I've taken this to an unhealthy level in the past so I have to watch out.
The problem is, there are so many people around me that suck and I don't want to have to deal with any of that shit AT ALL.

Someone from work I appreciated and basically trusted more than others flipped out at me for no reason. He just reacted aggressively to something and I happen to be the closest person so it was directed at me. I reacted right away by loudly telling him to not talk to me that way. Then he gaslighted me. Then he insisted on talking, and gaslighted me some more in more subtle ways. I got so disheartened I kinda pretended we were cool. But he's secretly black listed and I'll avoid him now. I don't trust him anymore. 

I can do that now. Completely shut that shit out. 

I planned a trip overseas for this summer. I've been focusing on that. A friend invited herself and I eventually got excited about having a travel partner. Then I got anxious cause she's the flaky kind and now I just want to go alone cause she annoyed me last week with her usual flaky behavior/wasting my time. I kinda lost interest in her cause, again, I don't want to have to deal with other people's shit.

You get the picture. I'm shutting everyone out . I mean, shutting out abusive people is a good thing. But I've no tolerance for general annoying human flaws now.

I'm not even going to talk about dating sites. Fuck all of them with their stupid sunglasses and pictures with dolphins.

I see myself going my own way, doing my thing, and being content with being completely alone all the time. That scares me. I thought I was done trying to prove the person who says no man is an island wrong.

And I don't know how to change that. There's got to be kind gentle people out there right?  People who won't flick their shit at me and tell me I'm too sensitive when I complain about it? People who won't turn on me? Right? RIGHT?",23May2019,2
20,"Recent events have gotten me thinking about death.  More from a philosophical view than anything else.

&amp;#x200B;

I live my life by the words ""Memento Mori"".  Remember to die.  This admittedly morbid saying has two meanings to me both separate yet intertwined.  The first is the realization that all we do, all we are, all we create, and all we will ever be, will eventually cease to exist.  We are not Gods and so must remain humble.

&amp;#x200B;

The other is that life is fleeting and may go at any point.  As the old saying goes: ""Eat, Drink, and Be Merry.  For tomorrow, we may die.""  This is a meaning I've been reminded of almost daily for the past year.  I've seen friends I was almost certain would outlive me go long before their time.  I've seen my town literally torn apart by natural disaster.  Every day, it seems, I open my social media to news that tragedy has struck someone I know personally, be it illness, accident, or the darkness within.

&amp;#x200B;

And so, I find myself meditating on death.  Its meaning both in the literal sense and to the dead and the living.  What death is and how it relates to us.  I suppose this is a question scholars have sought to answer since we were sentient enough to realize our own mortality.  I wish I was smart enough to have an answer.

&amp;#x200B;

It's our mortality, I believe, that makes death so painful to the living.  We spend our days in earnest pursuit of anything else that the sudden realization that we will end is often a slap in the face, leaving us stunned and unable to process.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the one question that all of us, yet none of us, will be able to answer is what will happen when we die.  I say all because, let's face it, we'll all die and I say none because the dead keep their secrets very well.  But I've always seen death as a natural progression, like drinking a beer and having to pee.  I don't fear death any more than I look forward to it.  I suppose you could call it apprehension mixed with more than a little curiosity.  The only downside is I won't be able to report on my experiences after.

&amp;#x200B;

That inevitably leads into the question of what we are.  Are we the sum of our life lessons and experiences?  Are we some ethereal being within a crumbling shell or are we something else altogether?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

I know what I believe and what I don't believe and these beliefs often clash with the beliefs of others.  I'm not here to debate or persuade.  Merely to share.  I suppose I'm only making an attempt to organize the thoughts in my head for some sort of analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there some ultimate lesson or even a central point?  I couldn't say.  Perhaps I just needed to speak my mind.

21,"I'm a college student, and I like to think of myself as fairly frugal when it comes to money. I'm definitely not someone who blows their paycheck the minute they get it. I save quite a lot, budget, but I was actually fortunate to receive scholarships and pell grants for next school year (and likely beyond) that will entirely cover my tuition. As such, I've been able to buy a few things that I held off on previously due to the need to save it all for school. 

This week I purchased a new phone, replacing the one that I've had for four years. There are a number of reasons I've been wanting to upgrade, but haven't been able to afford to until now. My dad won't even act excited for me, sneering at me, ""So glad you have the money to spend on that."" I won't go into much detail about this, but it's entirely hypocritical of him to criticize me for getting nice things every once in a while, considering he is one of the worst handlers of money. It's a constant point of tension between him and my mom. Anyway...

I just wish I could buy things every once in a while without having him make me feel irresponsible and guilty. Actually, part of the reason I got this new phone was because I wanted to get on my own plan so my parents wouldn't have to keep paying for it. Now that I don't have tuition to worry about, I'm able to start paying for a lot more of my own expenses.

""Africa isn't a fucking country.""

I have no reason to doubt this bold claim of yours, but 'White African' is generally used as a shortener for 'White *South* African'. 

""In the most Northern part of the **continent**of Africa, white people are native to those lands.""

1) Again, this person could be talking about South Africa.

2) This is Africa. See as how it is the origin of the human race, technically all races are native to this land.

An arbitrary distinction must be created; a drawn line, in other words. I'll leave that to smarter minds.

""And it's called immigration you fucking idiot. If there are no white Africans then there are no black Americans or Europeans.""

There are no *native* White Africans. That's why they have *white* before African. If they were native, they'd just be *African*.

Same applies to black Americans and Europeans. You wouldn't qualify those nationalities with an ethnicity unless it were foreign... at some point.",23May2019,0
25,"I grew up a white kid in the burbs, but Static Shock was one of my favorite characters and shows growing up. Of course I *related* more to Richie (Ritchy? Ritchie?) being the geeky white kid, but Static was still da bomb. I even made up my own character based on him. I just think it's a missed opportunity by DC/WB (*shocking*, right?) and a missed opportunity as a whole that they haven't done anything with that character in YEARS.

Maybe Injustice 3? I just don't understand how that cool and interesting of a character gets brushed aside.

Also Batman Beyond.

28,"I‚Äôm turning 19 this year, and although a lot of you might say that‚Äôs young, I‚Äôm just in the mindset that things need to change now or soon than later, because and then things are just going to stay the same. The best picture I can paint you is that I‚Äôm terrified of having a life like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/bn81hy/men_of_reddit_how_do_i_get_over_the_fact_my_20s/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app). 

I live in my parents house as an upcoming sophomore in college, and I probably have the independence of a 10th grader. Most people my age are busy going out and stuff, and it would be crazy if I decided I wanted to be out past 9 anywhere. My parents just blow my phone up, my dad will cuss me out, my mom will interrogate me about what I was doing, and it‚Äôs just like they try to make the biggest deal out of everything I do.

I don‚Äôt even have a relationship with my dad, and he just likes to bring me down whenever he gets the chance, and the best way I could describe it is just imagine a highschool bully was your dad, bc that‚Äôs what its basically like.

My mom is basically your textbook helicopter parent, and up until last year, freshmen year of college, is when I finally stopped letting her track me on her phone. She cried and literally balled her eyes out, and that kind of shows you the level at which she‚Äôs at because she thinks I‚Äôm some moron who doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs doing.

And all this has affected me, I don‚Äôt really have any friends, my summer so far had consisted of being high all day, and if I‚Äôm not high then I‚Äôm working out, and that‚Äôs pretty much it. I skateboard high, and I‚Äôm pretty much into every sport, but there really aren‚Äôt any leagues I can play in at this age, that aren‚Äôt extremely competitive. 

I feel like I‚Äôm living the suburban tragedy. Dysfunctional family, middle class, parents think there kid is fine, get decent grades, depressed as fuck, and the list goes on. I don‚Äôt like the direction my life‚Äôs heading in, and I don‚Äôt think I can continue to live like this.

Is there anybody who can tell me how to get out of this place, of your life just sucking. How do I change things up?

32,"I'm 19 years old still living with my mom as well as my sister except they both have jobs and I've been out of school for almost a year now so I'm pretty much a good for nothing at the moment except I help out at the and do the chores because they're not here to do it and it makes my moms life easier.

I was at home waiting for my sister to come back home from work so I can take the car to pick up my mom from work since we have only one car, I went to go take a shower and when i came out she was gone with the car so i called her while a little upset because she didn't say anything including i needed to pick up our mom and she didn't answer like always so it just made me more frustrated and I called my mom telling her what happened and we just assumed my sister went to pick her up.

When they both got home my mom had a frown face on and my sister just walked into her room. I asked my mom what happened this time? And she said that my sister got impatient and started acting like a brat then argued with her boss after her boss told her that it's wrong to talk to your mother like that.

3 days pass and me and my sister go to my other sisters house hang out for a bit and I just sitting with my after they start talking and then she told my bigger sister about what happened at my moms work place and she made it sound like she was the victim and made it sound like my mother's boss's attitude was the aggressive type and that hers was the calm soft type, like I was listening and was thinking to myself "" wtf!? She can't be serious, that would never happen but my moms boss is such a nice lady and my sister is kind of an aggressive impatient person"". 

The next day I go pick up my mom at that usual time, while we drive home and I ask her to be specific with what happened the other time with my sister and she tells me that my sister got impatient and went to basically tell her off saying "" why are taking so long!? I've been waiting in the car, I could've gone and done other things, blah blah blah blah..."" and so on , she said it in a very bratty and defensive tone and my moms boss heard and saw that and told my sister in a nice voice saying "" you shouldn't be talking to your mother like that"" and my sister said ""excuse me ?! Who do you think you are!?"" And things escalated from there verbally.

The only reason the boss intervened was because  my mom and her boss are friends including her children are very respectful to them, I know that for a fact and including she was very surprised to see my sister acting in that manner because she never brought her fucking piece of shit attitude outside the house so there was no surprise for me anywhere in that situation, hearing that in small detail it made me pretty upset because that boss is a nice lady and didn't deserve that treatment from my bitch of a sister. 

 including now my even older sister we visited now thinks that kind is nothing but another irrelevant bitch on the street, I honestly hate my sister that lives with my mom so much because she is fucking manipulative and treats me like fucking shit when shes not content and she verbally abused me every now and then during the weeks, sometimes she even fucking hits me by smacking me from anywhere from my shoulders up, and it fucking hurts, I yelled at her loud because it pissed me off and yells back at me as if I did something wrong. 

Shes been doing this for months ever since she moved in, and things that happen in the house she always twist everything my mom or me say and makes it sound worse than it really was or lies about things by mixing truth with lies and make herself the victim, shes a fucking pro at it. I honestly hate that fucking bitch so fucking much I just want her ass out the fucking house because she fucking ruining my self confidence that I've been trying to build up because I already had problems at school that fucking made me depressed and feel useless and her disgusting character just adds a huge load to it, because she mentions my personal struggles, takes a massive shit on it, and just throws it at my face, And what makes it worse, she doesn't even give a fuck. 

I'm tired of her and don't want to see her ever again but obviously I cant, shes the fucking reason i only eat 1 small meal a day and it not even a meal it's just cancerous junk food or cereal and that's it, I lost my appetite for food which is why I lie to mom that I eat three times a day or two because she gets mad when I don't eat, and because of it I've been feeling more sleepy than usual and and weaker and just out of it. 

 fucking hell even the 16 year old at my church wanted to box at my local church after church because he loves boxing, I said no because I wasn't  feeling it, just like wasn't feeling it for anything at the time, but he was being persistent so I said fine , and he fucking beat my ass because his stamina was superior to mine, but wasn't surprised because I was weak , malnourished,  tired and depressed, even so I felt like a complete useless and empty after that and I just ended making myself feel worse than I did before the boxing, but I didn't show it. 

My sister acts normal sometimes like if she doesn't have a nasty character but that's only when shes content, when something is bothering her she makes a big deal out it and gets mad at me for it, it's like she's fucking two face or something or has two personalities, and disgusting personality and then a Normal nice one, like I hate her so much but then when she acts nice I don't,  and its fucking bothering so much that she changes to her self entitled mood in an instant, I had many times where I wanted kill myself but never put it into action, the worst harm I've ever done was trying to stab my arm but only pushed it in my skin like half an inch and pulled out because of the pain, I can't even try to cut myself properly because I'm too much of a fucking pussy to. 

I just hate everything and hate my sister so much I even cried one time when home alone because i was thinking how much of a pathetic my existence was and that I wanted to fall asleep and never wake up, I bet it would feel way nicer than my current state, all I do is play video games or watch anime because that's the only thing that puts a smile on my face but I can't even do it for long because it becomes a chore so I just end up sleeping during the day but whenever I sleep during the day I just end up thinking of my sister calling me a lazy Useless peice of shit, because I'm still sleeping while she wakes up early and shes probably right.

35,"I‚Äôm in my early twenties. Had just finished school when I got the call about having cancer. The next 10 months are a blur, honestly. I went through fertility treatment, had my eggs frozen, got a port installed in my chest, and then began 12 rounds of aggressive chemotherapy. My last session was a week ago. 

Everyone is so happy for me. They keep saying I must be so overjoyed to have my life back and be getting back to normal. I don‚Äôt know how anyone with a brain can consider what I‚Äôm doing having ‚Äòmy life back.‚Äô I had to quit my internship back in November and haven‚Äôt worked since.

And actually, I get it. People in their twenties are not supposed to get cancer so I can see how that would be scary for them. 

Every time I look in the mirror, I just see my head with a few hairs and my thinning eyebrows, sunken eyes, I lost over 20 pounds during treatment. And beyond the physical parts, I am simply not who I was before I started treatment. Fuck, I was so hopeful. Life was good. And now I am scared. I‚Äôm a mess.

As I write this, I am sipping on a Coke and eating a whole row of pre-packaged cookies.

I can‚Äôt stop. I don‚Äôt know how. To. Stop.

And, tomorrow will be yet another day where I get no exercise.

Yes, I'm being a bit dramatic... but, I feel more helpless to overeating and food by the day! And, I'm super aware of my situation, as evidenced by the detail in this post!

I‚Äôve analyzed various aspects of my diet and have made a few strides to lose weight, but as of late, nothing's working and I am basically stuck.

In fact, the only time I see a way out is when I‚Äôm about to be full or I am full, then everything seems doable!

Can anyone relate?

I can‚Äôt take a weight loss drug because most interfere with my necessary psych meds. And the ones that don‚Äôt, have other problems that also make them a bad fit.

I do see a nutritionist and am doing so on a regular basis, so that's good.

What else do I do?

I don‚Äôt know how to get to rock bottom nor do I know how to get this monkey off my back.

This, coming from someone who used to be very mindful of what I put into my body, and what energy I was expending.

I'm not feeling sorry for myself here, but I am feeling a great sense of desperation!

My previous ex and I had started talking and we hooked up, we then hooked up on valentines day. And by then I had moved back to my home town. Recently I had something traumatic happen to me in my life and needed someone to hold me so I went and stayed at her house. That night it seemed like she was ignoring calls and texts while we cuddled and talked about getting back together officially. Next thing I know her brother busts through the door with his phone out on speaker phone and some guy yelling at her. She showed him away and I proceeded to grill her about who he was and why he was so upset about it. She told me he was her brothers friend who they had been talking for a week because he got her number from her brother. And that he was over reacting and that she wants to be with me, fix things and move out of her house, get a new job.  I wanted to give her another chance to be happy together and give her the world. Today I talked to her boyfriend of two years about what she had told us and how she played him and me for months. We spoke to her brother, who said she had been getting heroine for free and that there was probably another guy involved. I‚Äôm so heartbroken, I‚Äôve never been blind sided like this. In a moment of need I got betrayed, used, and weaponized to hurt her boyfriend emotionally. I‚Äôm crushed.",23May2019,2
51,"Ok so I was at my girlfriends house and she‚Äôs been having a shitty last few days. First off she lives in a trailer park and had a very dysfunctional family. A couple of days ago she went to the doctor for several appointments but the doctor got sick and canceled. Her grandparents then yelled at her during her work hours in front of everyone. When we went out, she wasn‚Äôt very talkative and then when we got back to her house, we had a conversation about eye color and apparently I interrupted her by mistake (even though she took a long pause so I thought she was done speaking) and then she got upset with me over it and stopped talking to me and completely fucking ignored me, I apologized profusely and said I didn‚Äôt mean to. After continuing to ignore me I said something along the lines of ‚Äúyou playing‚Äù and then she freaked out at me told me that I always interrupt when I had no fucking idea I was and never bothered to tell me and then continued not to talk to me. I had finally gotten tired of being ignored and after leaving she threw my jacket and at me, said goodnight angrily through gritted teeth and I told her i hope she feels better soon. Honestly I‚Äôm upset about the way that she treated me. I know that her family treats her well, but I still don‚Äôt see that as a good excuse to take that pain out on me. All I wanted to do was support her and she chewed it up and spit it back out in my face I feel like. I‚Äôm not sure what my next move should be.",23May2019,1

55,"I've never posted to reddit before so if I fuck the format up I'm sorry. I'm just at a breaking point in my life and I don't know how to cope or who to turn to. 

I'm nearly 11 months sober from a meth and heroin addiction. I also struggle with Bipolar disorder and I made some stupid decisions while manic lately that have fucked me, decision 1) decided to stop taking Abilify because I'm gaining a fair amount of weight from it 2) rationalized that it would be a good idea to start working graves at my job (in a addiction recovery setting).

Now (two weeks later) I'm dealing with the consequences of my impulsive decisions and I'm stuck miserable working hours at a job that have me as suicidal as I was in the depths of my addiction, wanting to use, and starting to feel crazy coming off of the med.

I am working on finding another job since my current job won't put me back on regular shifts, and I have started taking the med again until I can see a psychiatrist.

In the meantime, what do I do to deal with the depression and loneliness at night while I'm at work? I have a lot of free time to myself. any advice for how to steer away from a trip to the psych ward or relapse would be great. I tried figuring it out myself but I haven't come up with anything.",23May2019,3
56,"I broke up with my girlfriend 3-4 months ago, after 4 years living together (27M/29F).

I‚Äôm currently back to my country (Italy) for a few days. I‚Äôve been here for a week and I was supposed to go back to London today (which is where I live).

Since I still have some sort of a relationship with my ex, we were supposed to see each other one of these days. On my way to the airport I‚Äôve realized I was going back just to see her and it didn‚Äôt feel right.

I‚Äôm looking for a new job lately (I‚Äôm a UI designer) and I‚Äôve spent the last two months in London being depressed all day and basically staying there just to see her once a week, for a couple of a hours. It‚Äôs not worth it.

I was going to do the same mistake today; going back there, see my ex for a couple of hours and then spend an entire week depressed until I see her again. It‚Äôs not healthy and it‚Äôll not take me anywhere.

So today I‚Äôve decided to not go. I‚Äôll stay a few more days here with my family and enjoy the great weather and the beach.

Like they say ""yeah, uhmm, hmm, right"" all the time.

I never have an interesting conversation with anyone. I never had a best friend..so im a pretty horrible person with horrible personality.

Its always me asking questions not them..all i talk about is nonsense. No wonder no girl likes me ever. Or no one hangs out with me

Even my mom doesnt like me, she doesnt hate me too.

I dont know how to ask open minded questions.. just one word questions.

I chase people so they would give me attention and feel worthy but when it doesnt happen i feel unimportant. I want girls to chase me and give to me just like others guys get it also.. 

Like what the fuck do i do to make people like me and value me? Just dont chase them? How i do that w/o ignoring them?

And if i talk positively to my self if would be lying to my self. But i dont know how to do self improvement.

But i dont want to stay like a loser like this always.. i want a change but i dont know where to start. My soul doesnt accept this.. 

i might play video games and move away from those problems. But now i dont watch porn anymore cause video games..

65,"She broke up with me in a pretty brutal way, which was really unfitting for her usual behaviour. I mean even the break up was really weird, because the relationship went quite well. So at first I was extremely angry at her. For 2 months. But then when I became more neutral towards the whole thing I noticed that something was off. The last few times I saw her I was barely able to recognize her. It was almost like.. she was high on drugs. She was really energised and happy, which was quite weird since she was suicidal not even 2 weeks ago. But I was happy about that, so I didn't really care, I just enjoyed it. And then it struck me 2 months after the break up. At some point during the relationship her mental health was so damaged that she was in a clinic and she took a test there to see if she has a bipolar disorder. 

I informed myself about the illness for weeks and it became really clear that she in fact entered a manic episode. I looked through our entire conversation history on social media of the last 5 years (we only dated for 2 of those) and it became clear to me that there is certain cycle. 2,5 years depressive. 10 to 11 months manic. She even complained about it on a site similar to reddit, because she didn't know why she suddenly felt so bad again, after being extremely happy for 10 months. That was before our relationship.

So I messaged her. But she wasn't the same anymore. She told me she will never feel bad again, and that she hasn't felt that good in years and that I should please stop contacting her because she has someone new (that hurt.). 

I just told her ""Alright I won't, but please \[ex name\] if you feel bad again please contact me. I'm scared that you won't tell anybody about it."" (Reason for that is that she tried to commit suicide 2 times after she got out of her last manic episode, and they often regret break ups so I'm scared that she will just kill herself, without messaging anybody about it.)

So now I can't contact her again. It's been 7 months. The mania should end in 3 to 4 months. I have no way to find about how she currently is doing. There is a relatively high chance that she will commit suicide without even trying to contact me. Since she is undiagnosed I can't just call an ambulance.

There is a good chance that she will die during the mania. There is a good chance that she will commit suicide after the mania. There is a good chance that she will destroy her life during the mania. And there is absolutely nothing I can do. I won't go into detail, but if she behaves like in her last manic episode there is a really, really, really high chance that she will get raped or murdered. 

I don't know what do. I feel completely helpless and I hate it. I just want to help her, but I can't do anything but to wait to either learn about her death, may it be an overdose, murder or suicide, or to have her contact me and to then learn about how she destroyed her life, may it be HIV, drug addiction or a huge debt or criminal activity. 

It's been 7 months now and until now, no minute has passed without me thinking about her. I'm only 20, but this situation is by far the worst situation I've ever been in. I don't know what to do.",23May2019,5

68,"Hello,

Been looking around different subreddits trying to find a voice of reason. Long story short, I'm a do it yourself type of guy. I also hold myself and those around me to a high standard, which can be a downfall of mine. I've had friends (acquaintances) come and go. But this one in particular, could use some clarity. Have this friend since I was 9 (31M) so roughly 22 years. When I ask him to go out to events/parties/guys weekends, I am always the recipient of an excuse. 

This has been going on for about a year now, since I built him a PC. Some other information, he has been single for about 7 years, has a low income job, lives with his grandma. He also has a low self esteem because of some of these things. All of his close friends (i.e Myself and others) arent single, have kids, big boy jobs. It's hard for all of us to watch him struggle, however we have made numerous attempts to help. 

My question to you is. Do you give up on a lifelong friend? Whenever he asks for help I'm there. Whether its home improvement (for his gma), car repair, needs money. If I ask him for a simple favor, it's an excuse. So many excuses. I buy him stuff (low income job) so that he can do hobbies (ie Hunting/fishing/PC gaming/etc). Get him Birthday/Christmas gifts, with no expectations of a return. I'm trying to help his mental state but lately with life (2 kids under 4) it's been alot. Very very draining. So what would all of you guys do? Seems like losing a best friend is almost like losing a girlfriend, but I'm at the point of making a decision. 

Thanks so much for your input.",23May2019,3
69,"The question of how do you convince people to be good is a fascinating one, it‚Äôs at the core of almost everything that important to us in moving towards a safer more civilised future.

As far as I can tell the crux of morality is the ability to empathise - that is, to feel pain when we see it in others.

The universal real reason we don‚Äôt hurt other people is because it hurts us - this happens at 2 levels, the individual and the collective.

At the individual level, if we have empathy, the act of hurting someone else causes us emotional pain, so we avoid it.

At the collective level, hurting someone else makes society a less safe place, which is generally something we all want to avoid.

Every single reason and argument we have for being ‚Äúmoral‚Äù can be reduced to one or both of these two things - even the religious arguments for this boil down to an argument from avoiding pain, ‚ÄúGod will punish you (i.e make you feel bad)‚Äù.

I (and many other science fiction writers) have often wondered what we would do if an all powerful Alien species just like us (but totally devoid of empathy) came to Earth wanting to destroy our planet for their material gain.

There would be absolutely nothing we could say or do that would convince them not to destroy us.

If the same species like us, but with empathy, came to do the same thing, we could employ a huge number of arguments, all of which would be rooted in their ability to feel our pain, that might convince them otherwise.

I think this really gets to the heart of what it is to have a dialog about behaving in a moral way, and it really makes you realise that all of it is rooted in the ability to feel pain when we observe pain in others.

So the conclusion I come to is that morality is rooted totally in empathy. 

Therefore it follows that the argument that religion gives you a morality is a false one, it says nothing about the direct relationship between pain in others causing harm to yourself, instead it says if you do ‚Äúinsert arbitrary action the creator doesn‚Äôt like‚Äù, you will be punished by an external force, which isn‚Äôt a basis for morality, it‚Äôs a basis for tyranny.

With this in mind, we should be aware that for the reasons stated, a psychopath who is totally devoid of empathy and fear, can never be a moral agent. They can pretend to be, but the core capacity upon which all morality is based on is missing - which is why if given the proper opportunity, these people will almost always act in an immoral way if they think they can get away with it.",23May2019,0

74,"I'm 27 years old. So far in my 20's, I've had sex with over 50 prostitutes, almost killed myself in December, tried a lot of drugs, and almost died in a motorcycle accident. Sufficient to say I've had a pretty shitty go at life. I remember being told growing up that I ""had potential."" It was meant to be a compliment, but it just created a lot of pressure to be the person that everybody thought I would be. But I never believed in myself. I never believed that I could do the things other people encouraged me to do, and as a result, I settled. And then I blamed the people who convinced me to settle. But at the end of the day, it was my decision. It was my decision to take out a loan for a degree in a field I hated, only to end up in debt for no good reason. It was my decision to stay high for the better part of two years. It was my decision to fuck rando hookers because I was too afraid to be genuinely vulnerable with another person. I stopped believing people could love me, and almost killed myself over it.

Every year, I ask the people I love on their birthdays two questions. Where were you this time last year, and what is the biggest lesson you've learned since then? Nobody I know is gonna remember the question I asked them, so I wanted to give myself an opportunity to answer on my 27th birthday.

Last year I threw a birthday party for myself and invited everyone I knew. I remember being in a panic setting up. I remember nobody was helping and people were complaining the drinks weren't cold enough. I remember being anxious. I remember people showing up late when they were in charge of supplying things. I remember a distinct moment when I realized I wasn't close to any of them.

The most important lesson I've learned in this last year is to not waste time. Don't waste time on people, bad habits, a shitty job, whatever. You can't get it back. What you do everyday matters, and we get to choose. And I choose life. Today I just signed up for art classes at my local community college, and it's the first adult decision I've made that I can say with confidence I made for myself. Here's to a good year.",23May2019,65
75,"Last night I had my first experience using a Gender Neutral Bathroom built for more than single use occupancy. 

I am all for gender neutral single use restrooms (and gender equality, for what it's worth in the context of this post), but my experience last night gave me pause, and I had to share to see what other's thoughts are. 

I am at a local music venue for a show. I walk up to the bathroom door that I am used to using, and the sign ""MEN"" has been replaced with ""MULTI-STALL RESTROOM"". It had me hesitating to go in, but I figured that verbiage was a way of communicating gender neutral something. I push through the door to immediately be met by a group of girls. I pause and ask something like, ""is this gender neutral?"", and they half acknowledge that it is as they rush out the door. I'm feeling a tad uncomfortable, like I had intruded or something. I sense their discomfort as well. Whatever, I do my thing.

At the end of the night, I use the bathroom on my way out, and I bump into a girl that I had a couple causal, non serious experiences with over three years ago. It didn't end badly or anything, but we remember each other and we don't speak. So we both ""err,,,"" past each other to do our thing, and I leave before she does. Again, a slight feeling of discomfort, and it's probably the last place two people with that sort of history would want to bump into each other.

My main takeaway from this experience is just that I feel strongly these style of  bathrooms eliminate a certain level of privacy and safe space, for everyone involved. I believe this can be more or less true based on the context of the venue or environment. 

Are multi-stall restrooms more appropriate for say, casual, family friendly environments, and not as much for 21+ venues such as clubs/bars, or other entertainment venues (sporting events, maybe anywhere where drugs or alcohol are likely to be present? Was this more of just an initial shock, something that will take getting used to should these bathrooms become more popular? Has anyone else had a similar experience to share, good or bad?

This experience has been running around my brain and I'm anxious to put it out there to see what other are thinking about this sort of concept.",23May2019,6

I know my Dad will be understanding. He is not a stranger to these types of things, and we‚Äôve even (kindof) talked about this kind of stuff. 
My Mom, however... I have no idea. I think it‚Äôs possible she‚Äôll feel hurt and she‚Äôll think it‚Äôs her fault and that I hate her. I don‚Äôt. 
If I were to be diagnosed with some form of personality disorder (realistically speaking, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this were the case) I think my Mom would use that as an excuse/explanation as to how I act. 
They will both look at me differently for this, and I don‚Äôt know if I can handle that. Of course, I should be happy about that. I‚Äôm not the same person I was in 2015. I‚Äôm hardly even the same person I was 6 months ago.
A little while ago, I told myself I didn‚Äôt want things to stay the same. I wanted things to change. I either wanted things to get better, or worse. And they have gotten worse. 
I don‚Äôt know if I can handle the change that this will bring on. I want things to get better, but they‚Äôre going to have to get a lot harder first.
I haven‚Äôt even started on the therapy itself. 
I don‚Äôt know how to talk about how I feel. I don‚Äôt even know how I feel. And even if I were able to describe my feelings, it wouldn‚Äôt feel real when I started talking about them. The last time I went to a therapist, it was the same way, and I know it won‚Äôt be much different. 
I was never comfortable with making eye contact with people. I‚Äôm still not. I don‚Äôt want to go back to a therapist to have the same experience I did then. I want to talk as mutuals and I don‚Äôt want to be told what to do and if I don‚Äôt want to do something you have. To. Understand. That. 
Privacy is very important to me and it has been violated many times in the past. If I tell one person something personal (although I don‚Äôt do that anymore), I don‚Äôt want them to just go and repeat it to someone else. Don‚Äôt go through my phone again. And don‚Äôt just walk into my room and look through my stuff whenever you feel like it. 
I can‚Äôt stand being serious. I try not to take anything seriously. I avoid answering serious questions from my friends, and in turn they‚Äôve stopped asking. But I‚Äôve gotta do this if I ever want to be happy again. I don‚Äôt really care if I don‚Äôt end up being happy though, I just don‚Äôt want keep feeling like whatever this is.
Both parents are in the dark about this stuff, but they have their suspicions. 
I need to tell them that I need to see a therapist, but how do I approach this? What do I tell them? I don‚Äôt want to end up putting this off ‚Äòuntil next week‚Äô... then ‚Äòuntil next month‚Äô... because then school will start back up again and I won‚Äôt do it at all.

81,"TLDR; After 10 years of being anxious to drive, afraid of being bad at something, and being pushed and pressured by everybody I know, I FINALLY conquered my anxieties and I can now drive a car all by myself!!! 

I live in Ontario, Canada where we have the G1 (written test, must drive with a fully licensed driver), G2 (can drive alone with some limitations), and G which is fully licensed. I got my G2 yesterday, but since I am old af I don‚Äôt have some of the limitations that are in place for younger drivers. 

I‚Äôve always been anxious in cars, and have issues with perfectionism so when I tried driving at age 14-15 (on empty back roads with my mom), and I wasn‚Äôt good at it? I completely shut down. Not in a boastful way but I usually pick things up really easily, but driving was really difficult for me so I just felt stupid and avoided it. The drive centre was on strike when I turned 16, and then when the strike ended I just never bothered. I moved to Toronto when I was 18 where it is unrealistic to have a car, so again I never bothered. I got my G1 when I turned 19 so I could have a piece of ID (legal drinking age) but I still never practiced driving. 

As I got older, friends and family really started ragging on me to get my license which made me feel even worse. It just wasn‚Äôt acceptable to them that I was afraid or anxious. I felt so embarrassed that I was in my mid 20‚Äôs and couldn‚Äôt drive. And as we all know, the older you get, the scarier things become lol. I moved to a smaller town with my boyfriend and having to rely on him for rides put a huge toll on our relationship. I am a social worker, and all of my schooling was done in Toronto where nobody has a car, so nobody told me that social work jobs outside of the city will *require* your own vehicle. So it has impacted my professional life as well. 

I finally told myself enough is enough, and I completed 3 months of Driver‚Äôs ED, and yesterday I drove my G2 test and passed with flying colours!! I‚Äôm looking at buying a car literally tomorrow so that I can be open for more jobs. I can‚Äôt believe it! 

Sorry for the long story, it‚Äôs just been such a long road for me to get to this point and with the exception of my mom and boyfriend, I‚Äôm still just getting the ‚ÄúWOW FINALLY‚Äù response, and lectures about how I‚Äôm still not a good driver because I‚Äôm new lol. Soooo I just wanted to express my excitement and pride here üôà thanks to anyone who read!",23May2019,5

Hello, I am 21 years old in my second year of college and I want to talk about some stuff that I have no one else to talk to about. My life is a complete failure, literally. I have finally discovered that I have no friends and the worst thing is that I can‚Äôt do anything about it. I don‚Äôt fit in anywhere in the society I don‚Äôt like any of the things that my society is interested in. At first that was okay for me but then everything changed. I can‚Äôt find a group of friends that I belong to.

I had friends in school but I always had the feeling that they treated me with pity and I hated that but I continued to hang out with them; even though they always didn‚Äôt care about me because when I disappear for a while because I have had enough with them no one calls me or asks how I am doing. And when they remember to call me (like once in the week) I am the one who is always blamed that I don‚Äôt call or ask how are they doing.

I started disliking their company because they always hang around and do nothing in the same places and complain about everything. I don‚Äôt feel happy around them they bring me down and I want the kind of people in my life who lift me up. After a while I became fed up with that and I couldn‚Äôt stand this no more so I decided to take a break from them for a while. It‚Äôs been 4 months now and in those 4 months they called me like 7-8 times and they say the same shit again and again.

My new friends from college, actually I don‚Äôt consider them to be my friends, not because they mistreat me but because I don‚Äôt fit in with them or their friends and it hurts me a lot but I don‚Äôt know anyone else in college so I stick with them. I have the same feeling that they treat me with pity but I got nowhere else to go.

I don‚Äôt know what to do my life is a train wreck right now and I don‚Äôt know what to do I am very depressed and I think of suicide a million times per day and what‚Äôs worse is that I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to about any of this my brothers live abroad and they can‚Äôt help me even if I tell them. I don‚Äôt want to talk about all of this a lot to my mom either because I don‚Äôt want to upset her and depress her like me; I mean she‚Äôs doing the best she can to provide to herself and me a good life because my dad is douchebag who doesn‚Äôt pay allowance for me since they split up 8 years ago.

This lead to numerous problems:

1-I can‚Äôt afford to go to the gym or to go to a nutritionist to start a diet and exercising because I am 30 KG overweight. I have a lot of insecurities because of this and I can‚Äôt do anything about it which makes me even more disappointed.

2-I can‚Äôt afford to learn drums which is something I really love and I want to get into.

3-I want to buy a bike but I can‚Äôt afford one.

I have major OCD which is getting stronger and making my already miserable life more miserable. I don‚Äôt communicate with girls well because I don‚Äôt have any sisters and in my childhood I didn‚Äôt have contact with many girls. I have never been in a relationship.

I wasn‚Äôt doing many activities as a child which is a major contributor to this, and was because of my dad also that I didn‚Äôt do much because he wanted to raise me as an introvert nerd which, I think now that I look back at my life, is true! Now I am having difficulty communicating with girls now that they are in my everyday life.

I feel like the rest of my life is going to be that way; that nothing will ever change, that I am going to live and die as a useless piece of shit. All of this has been around for a long time and I always had hope that tomorrow will be better and one day my life will be as I imagined it. But recently I can‚Äôt help it but get depressed all of the time and I can‚Äôt see hope again, I lost faith in everything and I can‚Äôt think of anything but suicide.",23May2019,7
83,"So I'm going to try to explain this as best as possible. I try to be an ally for all marginalized communities of people, and I realize that I am not perfect, but I'm trying.

So what do I do when someone in that community expresses an opinion that is the opposite of what is generally believed by that community.

Example: If people are discussing Black Lives Matter and someone pops in with a: ""Well, I'm black and I think this is all stupid""
Or recently on a message board people from the LGBTQ community were expressing similar opinions on one subject, but there was one person who kept arguing against it. I responded to that person to say something like: ""I'm thinking we should trust the opinions given by people in the LGBTQ community who have commented"" and the opposing person fires back with: ""I am LGBTQ"".

Or I get in situations where I am trying to call out family members or friends for saying things that are blatantly racist or awful and someone of that community will be like: ""Well, I'M not offended""

So what do I do? Should I just not talk? I thought being a good Ally meant having difficult conversations and checking your peers when they say/do something inappropriate. But what do I do when that peer turns out to be part of the community? Or someone from the community excuses the other person's behavior?

92,"I wanna preface this by saying that overall I like my boss, he's a good guy, and he's been good to me over the last 16 months I've been working for him. With all that being said, there's some things he does that really irritate me. Of all these things, the one that's top of the line is this habit of his that I find to be rude, gross, and unpleasant.

&amp;#x200B;

I swear on average every 2 minutes or so, my boss makes this loud, unpleasant, grunt-like sound in order to clear his throat. I took the liberty of recording some from my laptop (unbeknownst to him obviously- and I know I'm an asshole for doing that) You can listen to it here: [https://clyp.it/jpgf1qsp](https://clyp.it/jpgf1qsp) 

&amp;#x200B;

Our desks are about 8-10 feet away from eachother and it's typically pretty quiet in the room while we type away on our laptops, so it'll always come completely out of nowhere and usually startles me.

&amp;#x200B;

What bothers me about it the most, is not because its gross, which it is, but it's the fact that he seems quite shameless about it. After making these noises, he never follows up with saying something like ""excuse me"" or ""sorry"". I understand that as humans we occasionally get congestion in our throat and in our sinuses and we need to relief ourselves of it, but come on. At least acknowledge and understand that there are other people in the vicinity whose ears are being subjected to these frequent and foul sounds.

&amp;#x200B;

We all get stuffed up from time to time, I don't think any human goes through life without ever having a period of congestion at least once in their life. Sometimes I need to clear my throat and so I try and do that as quietly and subtly as possible and if I do make more noise than usual, I'll say excuse me. I think most humans when they're not feeling well, will try and do something about it, such as take medicine or simply drink a cup of tea, etc. My boss on the other hand, doesn't seem to try and do anything about it. Every single day, he drinks on average 4 to 5 cans of diet coke. In the 16 months I've known my boss, I HAVE NEVER ONCE SEEN HIM DRINK WATER. As a living organism, I don't understand how he gets his water.

&amp;#x200B;

Anywho, I just wanted to share this. As gross and bothersome as it is, I'm glad I've encountered it because these things teach you to be aware and mindful of the people around me.

100,"I created this account to make this post. I don't have anywhere else to put my feelings, so I guess I'll vent here. 

backstory: 

I'm almost 14 years old. I've been dealing with severe mental and physical health problems since I was 9. 
right now, I'm overseas because I just had a surgery that is supposed to help with my medical conditions. the surgery isn't available in the US so I had to fly to Spain to get it done.
my family is really poor so a few months before this trip we made a gofundme and we raised a pretty decent amount of money to help cover the 20,000$ surgery. 
I have filum disease accompanied by postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and chiari malformation.  the surgery I just had was a tethered¬†spinal¬†cord release, in order to cure the chiari malformation. the POTS is likely caused by the chiari, but there's no way to tell. 
I am recovering well and don't have any more pain than usual. I don't feel any different so far but it will take me about a year to fully recover. I'll be flying back home in a few days, and in about 40 days i will start physical therapy. 
I have been very weak and constantly fatigued since i was diagnosed. I've dealt with constant head/leg/back/neck/stomach pain for years. 
until I was 10, i was really strong and active despite being a little kid, because I was a dancer. I danced for like 5 hours a week but i quit because my symptoms got too bad.
in 6th grade and the first half of 7th grade, I started missing a lot of school because of my mental &amp; physical health. I basically completely missed the whole second half of 7th grade. 
I'm terrified of the process of recovering and starting physical therapy because my tachycardia makes it really hard for me to be physically active. 
i'm terrified of mentally recovering because I genuinely cant remember my early childhood before being diagnosed or being happy with my life. I feel like I've missed out on my whole childhood because I've spent the whole time being miserable, and I want to get out of it, but at the same time I don't know what it's like to be happy with myself and I don't know what I would do with myself if all my problems were gone.
I've self harmed a shit ton in the past and been suicidal for as long as I can remember. one of the only things that has kept me from suicide is the fact that I don't know what happens after. what if it's not what I expect? what if I go to hell for being a lesbian? I don't fucking know.
The other reason is that I love my baby niece and nephew too much to leave them behind. 
for those reasons, I know that I'm not actually going to do it but that won't stop me from being mad at myself because I won't and crying because of how much I want to. 
I'm supposed to be in 8th grade now, but I was missing so much school and was unable to focus on any school work that my mom has decided to ""homeschool"" me. 
My mom is gone/busy most of the time and doesn't really homeschool me at all. even if she did try to, I probably wouldn't be able to do it because I have a lot of trouble focusing and am sick most of the time. 
another reason I stopped coming to school was how terrible my ""friends"" were. I was with the same group of weird furry kids until I left school. they accused me of faking all of my illnesses on countless occasions, and they would make up rumors about each other and about me. everyone believes everything they hear at that school. honestly those kids are the biggest idiots I've ever met in my life. Bryson, if you're reading this, FUCK you. seriously, you're a dramatic asshole and you smell like cat piss. even all of your asshole friends agreed with me that you smell like cat piss. 
When I left that school, nobody seemed to care. Not that that's a bad thing though because I really don't want anything to do with them. 
I'm supposed to be in high school in August/September (can't remember which month) and I'm terrified. I don't have any friends, so I spend all of my time isolating myself, laying in bed staring at the wall or playing ukulele. 
I basically have no education after 5th grade because even in 6th and 7th grade it was hard for me to focus or complete homework/schoolwork. 
I barely ever leave my house or even my room. I have bad social anxiety so I do not talk to anyone except my family. if I do talk to anyone at all, I stutter, I talk too quietly for anyone to hear, I mix up my words and generally either sound like an idiot or like I'm being really rude.  

I don't really know how to end this rant. if there's actually someone reading this who made it this far - congrats I guess. I'm sorry it was so out of order and random. I struggle to put my thoughts into words but I just had to put them somewhere.",23May2019,4

102,"I wanted to avoid the embarrassment of having to tell anyone I have failed the test, in case it happens, and it did. One family member in particular is not supportive of me ever driving so I currently suffer in silence.

I have so much anxiety when I take any test really, so my heart was pounding but I tried to stay calm. Everything went well, the highway, the parking, the turn-around, until the last minutes on the way back, I suddenly didn‚Äòt see an old man trying to cross when I came around the corner. I‚Äòm SO MAD AT MYSELF, how did I literally check every time before at every crossing or intersection and on this corner I didn‚Äòt...

I wouldn‚Äòt be so upset with myself if it wasn‚Äòt so expensive to just take the test. It‚Äòs almost 250 ‚Ç¨ where I‚Äòm from. Not talking about the driving lessons, only the test. So I had to pay that much just to feel sad and disappointed in myself lol. I wish I was rich, just to get rid of that financial pressure, because it makes me even more nervous.

So now I‚Äòm posting this here because I don‚Äòt know what to do with my sadness all by myself and maybe there is someone who knows how I can cheer myself up.

103,"A bit morbid so definitely not for anyone too emotionally sensitive. I just felt like I need to put this down somewhere because although I've spoken to my girlfriend and friends about what I saw just to let it out I really just wanna put it all down for myself and this seems like the place to do so. But again, disclaimer for more emotionally sensitive people 

So, I was being driven home by my mum yesterday with my sister in the car, we were just one road away from home and I look up from my phone for just a moment and just in front of me I see a child stumble from the hands of his mother  into the road for a millisecond, and his head collided with the wing mirror of a car. Even though I knew what had happened I didn't really process it fully until the car drove past and I saw the kids body, motionless on the ground. The mother screamed and I think I'll remember the sound of it for the rest of my life. It was horrifying and bone chilling and I could feel the pure terror in her voice as she fell to her knees and just kept on screaming and screaming. Immediately there was a panic and everyone at the seen gathered round and called all the necessary emergencies. For a few minutes I watched as people came over help the child and attend to the mother but from the sound she had made it was as if she already knew there was nothing to be done. I looked over at the kid that was still not moving and saw a puddle of blood forming around his head and I just knew that this was seriously bad. My mum had to stay there with my sister in the car because we were witnesses but luckily my sister didn't really see anything and wasn't aware of the condition of the child, but she heard the screams and closed her eyes and cries at the sounds of what was happening outside. The ambulance eventually arrived and the three paramedics immediately began CPR on the child and have the vivid image of them on their knees around the child pressing on his small chest with the mother just watching. At this point they took the mother away and I knew that there was no hope for the child. 

Eventually the police dismissed us and I got home, hugged my mum and I called my girlfriend to tell what had happened and to let out my feelings and that really helped. But I can still hear the sound of the mother's scream and the image of the paramedics trying to resuscitate the poor child is stuck in my head. I think this is one of the moments that stay with you forever, I know the mother's desperate cry will definitely haunt me. 

I've been mostly distracted from it all because I'm working on my A-levels at the moment, but I really just wanted to take a moment to let it out and this has helped.",23May2019,17

Very abruptly my boyfriend‚Äôs(31m) job went south and he wanted to move back to his home state to finish his degree. I support him in this and still do. I came with him so that we could build our lives together for a better future for us.

After telling me that I had a great video interview, seemed very intelligent and that they would have loved to hire me on the spot. When I got the email declining my application I called the hiring manager very politely asking for constructive criticism that I could take with me for future interviews. 

I go through periods of hope and despair. I just so desperately want to start working on my future. I hate that my boyfriend currently has all of the financial burden for the both of us. I want to be contributing to our future and lightening his load.

118,"(I'm on mobile so sorry if the formatting is a bit wibbly!!) 

Three years ago, I left my old secondary school (I didn't graduate btw I left of various reasons). Flash forward to now and I've been in my new one since around spring 2018 and I should be enjoying myself but I can't, I genuinely can't enjoy most things anymore. 

Ever since I've left, all of my childhood friends from school a have crafted amazing memories and inside jokes. Of course I've still kept close to them, but it's not the same when you're trapped behind what seems like a glass barrier, watching everyone get closer while you're getting further away. 

I was out of school for two years. For two years I had barely any contact with anyone that wasn't my immediate household family. This has genuinely damaged my ability to even converse with people and my friends list is so small that you could count on two hands and still have fingers to spare!
I was isolated (unintentionally) but I didn't actually feel the effects of that and having to move down a year (because of timing with the school switch) until now... I didn't realise how lonely I was.

Their last day of secondary was today, but I have to stay to finish another year and im pretty sure I'll lose all contact with them. I'm so alone, I don't talk to anyone where I am now and I'm just longing for something.. Anything! It sounds silly. They're all going to move on, move away from me, and forget me. I'll have nobody and that's what terrifies me. I don't want them to forget about me, but I realise that I wasn't really the best person to connect with socially anyway. 

Just to round up, I'm in a bad mental health place right now. I'm lonely, my friends are getting on with their lives and I feel like I'll miss my chance to stay in their lives. Not really a cry for help, just wanted to get this out of my system.",23May2019,1
120,"I‚Äôve been going through chemotherapy since March. It‚Äôs a less aggressive one, so I live pretty normally with the biggest issues being my low blood counts and nausea for a few days after treatment. 

Since chemo murders your immune system and since I thought I‚Äôd be done with treatment at the end of September, I thought it would be best to take a gap year from college. This way, I could heal for a few months from treatment, go travel, and still be able to start as a true freshman in college with all of the freshman events that come with fall quarters (I didn‚Äôt want to start mid year). 

Now my oncologist is saying I‚Äôm ending chemotherapy a month before my college date starts, so if all goes well I could technically go to school. This wouldn‚Äôt leave time to fix my blood counts or really be ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù again, but I‚Äôm halfway through and right now I feel good. 

I thought I‚Äôd be excited, but I‚Äôm just confused and conflicted. I already had a gap year approved and set in with the school registration, I missed the dorm deadlines, I changed my honors program for fall 2020 and not fall 2019, and I just hadn‚Äôt expected to go. Now that I can and it‚Äôs possibly an option (if they find chemo was successful)- I‚Äôm just, disappointed? Confused? College was and is my dream, but I had mentally prepared to hold it off for so long that I feel lost now that I have that option again. 

Is this wrong to feel this way? I feel like part of me wants to keep my gap year, but I hate doing nothing right now. Obviously I would also get a job next year but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll be wasting my time and life if I choose that. My family is upset at me that I‚Äôm not as excited as they are, and are mad that I‚Äôm not sure what to do.

121,"I‚Äôm a junior in high school, and this year has been really down for me. Last year, I was pretty social (went out with my friends at least once a month) and more open with my friends (like being friendly or wanting to be with them).

But this year just feels like a curveball. I‚Äôve been sleeping more, about one or two naps a week, which I never did before. I haven‚Äôt had nearly as much motivation to do stuff with my friends. I‚Äôve denied one of my friends a few times, which I think makes him frustrated, so he‚Äôs done stuff with other friends. My other friends have moved onto doing stuff with other people. It makes me a little jealous, but the thought of socializing feels more like a big deal than last year.

I made a friend last year and another at the very start of this year. They tell me they‚Äôre there for me if I want to talk to them about private stuff. But for the past few months, I‚Äôm getting this gut feeling that they are better than me and I‚Äôm just not really important to them. When it‚Äôs us 3, I always feel like I don‚Äôt belong there and that they sometimes leave me out. But, they expect me to be funny, and I just can‚Äôt do that all the time. These new friends also work at a nearby mall, but I get nervous and tired, so I don‚Äôt wanna walk in or see them. 

These new friends tell me that they‚Äôre there for me, but I never get any motivation to talk to them about stuff on my mind or even ask for help on math homework. When I talk to them, I always get that same gut feeling that I‚Äôm not needed. And its getting to a point to where I sometimes feel like sitting by myself than having to force myself to socialize. I‚Äôve also been sitting away from my family, like they‚Äôre all downstairs and I‚Äôm up in my room because I don‚Äôt wanna socialize.

I do have some things that I enjoy, like anime and sports. The good part of this year is my new friend set me up with a date for my junior prom. We didn‚Äôt talk a ton at the prom, but I had a fun time at the prom. And I‚Äôve improved on small talk with different people. But there‚Äôs some things that have always kinda lingered around with me. I‚Äôve never liked photos of myself even when I was young, and I never take photos of myself. I personally don‚Äôt like the way I look, tbh. And I‚Äôve found myself thinking ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point?‚Äù more than usual (but I‚Äôve been thinking those thoughts for a few years now). 

I‚Äôve had a therapist for a few years, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve been this open to her. I used to have bad anxiety growing up and I could‚Äôve been on medication if I asked (her words). She says I still have a mild anxiety, since I worry a lot about small things. 

What made me open my eyes was that I heard my parents talk about me behind my back and say ‚ÄúI think he has depression‚Äù. When my parents said that, that‚Äôs when I started to think about how this school year has been like this sort of loop. I‚Äôve been telling myself the past few months ‚ÄúEverything will get better next year‚Äù, but I just don‚Äôt know.

I know mental health is a very complicated topic, and there are people with more serious problems than me. I apologize if I offended anyone or anything like that, or if I‚Äôm making irrational conclusions. I appreciate those who read the whole thing, and if anyone has thoughts, I‚Äôll read them.",23May2019,1
122,Because of my OCD I keep a 2 foot distance between myself and the urinal. There have been times in my life where I was able to stand closer but right now I don‚Äôt stand closer than 2 feet. This has not been a problem for the most part and only a couple times has someone walked through my urine stream. How far away do you stand from the urinal? Does anyone here stand farther than what is considered normal?,23May2019,0

I will update this post twice a day for the duration of Karen's stay. I thought it would be fun to update it as everything happens so everyone can experience each segment right after they happen.

If you would rather the full post once the visit is concluded, leave a comment, and if people seem to agree, I will remove the post and re-upload at its completion. 

# Preface:

Here‚Äôs some context before we get to the weird. I currently live with my brother and sister-in-law which works well for everyone because my brother spends about half the year in other countries for work. So I take care of the house and animals while he‚Äôs away and my sister-in-law is visiting family around the US. I‚Äôm not a huge social person. I guess you could say i'm an introverted extrovert. If left to my own choices I‚Äôm perfectly fine by myself for months on end. However, If I am put into a social situation i'm pretty outgoing and enjoy myself.  Here is where it begins... My sister-in-law asks if her friend can stay in the house for a week as she is coming in town for her daughter's graduation. I thought it was super nice she asked even though she didn‚Äôt really need to, as it is her house. Of course I say no problem and then we begin.

# Night 1: 

Lady, we will call her Karen, arrives. Karen is roughly 12 years older than I am. I‚Äôm in my late twenties. We start talking and drinking, thinking if i‚Äôm going to spend a week with this person I might as well get to know them. Hours go by and lots of drinking, turns out we can both hold our alcohol pretty well and we‚Äôre having good conversation about all kinds of random things. Several hours into talking I realize I've met her, her kids, and her husband a couple years before. I‚Äôm pretty honest, direct, and hard to make feel uncomfortable, especially when I've been drinking, but even I didn‚Äôt quite believe the series of events about to unfold. She asked if I wanted to watch a movie, I was like yeah sure, that‚Äôs cool. Then she quickly added ‚Äúand cuddle‚Äù afterwards. To which I replied, ‚Äúuhhhh, no haha, I‚Äôm not feeling that‚Äù. No awkwardness at this point. She's a touchy feely person and i'm not so much unless its my girlfriend or something. So when Karen gets close or touches my arm too much, I subconsciously move somewhere else. Karen calls me out on this, saying ""Oh, you don't like to be touched"". I reply with ""Yeah, pretty much unless I know the person well, then I really don't mind at all"". 

Here‚Äôs where shit gets weird. She then proceeds to declare she wants to take a bath.. Okay whatever right? Strait up gets butt ass naked and starts walking around. Please remember, shes way older than me, has kids, and is married currently. Even in my drunken state I was like WTF internally, but kept my cool like it was no big deal. Karen then proceeds to ask me to join her in the bath. That was a hella quick no from me. Karen then is not quite yelling but louder than a talking voice is requesting that I at least talk to her while she is in the bath. Again, my mind is saying WTF, but I act as normal as possible, thinking it‚Äôs only the first day, try not to make it awkward for the next 6 days. So much to my own unease I continue to talk while looking anywhere else. Skip to after, I‚Äôm thinking okay, its late, i'm tired, and that was a lot of weird for one night. I say goodnight and start walking to my room. Karen quickly asks to get me to sleep in her bed, or if she could sleep in mine. That‚Äôs where I finally started to get a little annoyed and told Karen absolutely not, maybe if your daughter was here, she could. Not being serious but trying to make my point that it‚Äôs not going to happen, ever, in a million years. Karen finally gives up and goes to bed alone.

# Day 2:

I wake up and Immediately text my friend (female) about the night before, to which they thought it was fucking hilarious. I also happened to talk to my brother for awhile and told him everything to which he has the same reaction I had so far. Something along the lines of ‚ÄúWhat the actual fuck? That‚Äôs kinda hilarious and a really funny story.‚Äù My brother knows of Karen but doesn‚Äôt really know her any better than I did. My brother then proceeds to enlighten me that this isn‚Äôt the first time one of my sister-in-laws friends has done something like this. According to him, everyone in the town they are from does some shit just as seemingly odd to us. Specific examples include adult women showering with their mom and unrelated adult women showering together. At this point I realize I‚Äôm going to have to roll with the awkwardness because it‚Äôs going to be a journey. When I see Karen in the morning, she is, of course, walking around naked again. Not exactly the first thing I want to see in the morning. We exchange a good morning, and I proceed to go to my office and start working, as I work from home. At this point she is getting ready to go to her daughters graduation and I realize this isn't going to stop so I might as well get a good story out of it and let everyone else enjoy...

127,"I‚Äôve been depressed for probably my whole life. 

Aimless, wandering, full of morals but unable to keep them, always failing and flailing, thinking everything and everyone is pointless... commitment is challenging for me... but I‚Äôve decided recently that I want to live the way of the warrior and be risky and courageous. 

I want to be wise but I also want to be vulnerable and open. I want to love other people without expecting anything back. 

I want to commit to being something great and doing the most I can in the world for humankind to at least help end the suffering around us and for us. 

I am going on to commit to these things- they‚Äôve always been there calling to me, but I‚Äôve been afraid to take the risk.

I‚Äôm ready now!",23May2019,1

129,"I (f) kinda liked this person (m) in the beginning but I was pretty much hung up on this other guy and was also pretty scared of falling for someone else. Now it's the end of the school year and I've healed almost completely and just need to worry about final projects and exams. Now he's a year above me and is graduating soon and is probably not going to be at school after the beginning of next week. I wasn't sure if I should try to make a move and kind of risk myself for this last effort of falling for someone who really isn't so bad. 

Please help me with some advice and guidance!!!!",23May2019,3
131,"The car is totaled and I have loads of bruises and scars on my legs from the airbags (newer vehicle) and a rather gnarly scratch down my neck/collar bone. 

We ran into a tree in the middle of the road, at night, in the dark. Almost got hit by a car (who also wrecked into the crash) and had to worry about open power lines.

I am in shock we all made it out with our life and so upset about the fact that we almost all lost our lives.
