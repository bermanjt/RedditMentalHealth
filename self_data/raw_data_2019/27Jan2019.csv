1,"I work at a place that sells sandwiches. I've been there since June. My boss and I hit it off great, and I considered her a friend. 

A lot of my coworkers left not long after I came aboard. One left because she hated the boss being, well, the boss. Another left for a family crisis, another got fired. People came and went, but I was always the one that she'd ask to stay late because one of them had an emergency, or one of them was sent home because he was drunk, or this or that. I was the person she asked. When the morning opener called out one too many times, who did she ask to come in at 6 every day in his place? Me. 

I forgot that at the end of the day I'm just a body. Anyone can swoop into my place and I can get booted out and no one behind that counter will give a shit. I am a low-paid fast-food worker.

My boss ratted me out to *her* boss. Her boss scares me, and she KNOWS he scares me. No one likes this guy. He's a huge dude who's given my boss anxiety attacks, and he's never got a kind word to say. He's just a mean spirited person.

He played nice. He came over to my table and had acted as friendly as possible as he told me to stay with the company. 

""You're one of our best workers!"" and ""I'm impressed by your work!"" and just laying on the compliments that I knew weren't true. My job is to build sandwiches and punch buttons on a computer. Anyone can do that and he knows it. He knows people are leaving.

I'm not as oblivious as people think. I've got enough brain cells to put two and two together. I told my boss what it'd take to keep me, and she told her boss what it'd take to keep me; Him not being an asshole, and better pay.

Well... at least now I know I am worth a *quarter more* and a shitty pep talk to these people. That's it. That's what I am worth.

My coworkers are, currently, job hunting. Even my boss is job hunting. The reason I told her in the first place was because she told ME FIRST that she was looking. Why?

She hates her boss.

Everyone is leaving because this man is a polished turd, the pay is shit, and no one wants to be here when half the people who come here for food are assholes.

I'm mad at myself for trusting her. I'm mad that I thought she'd appreciate being given a heads up. I should have known better. 

The only upside to this? The woman at the corner store I pass on my way home is an actual friend. I applied to work there, and I had the interview, and I chickened out and told her boss I was no longer interested the day after this all went down. Why? I'm a goddamn coward who thought things might change.

So when she asked what happened and why I withdrew... I told her. I told her everything. You ever see someone go from friendly to pissed off in half a second? That was her. The funny part is that she used to work at the store I'm in. She knows ALL about the fuckery behind the scenes. She knows what I'm dealing with.  So, she, being a generally nice human being, said she'd talk to her boss about what happened and see if she can get me back in his good graces.

What a fucking week.",27Jan2019,1
2,"I'm seeing things, is this what I saw before? I fear that I will kill myself from whatever that figure was. ""Childhood"" is what I called it, I believe I was calmed by using reddit. It's scary but I may not be able to be sane enough to get medicine. I can't drive, I feel like passing out. I am going to die without knowing it. I hope God stays with me.",27Jan2019,1
3,"I probably have asthma. My GP was almost certain, and I've had all the symptoms of asthma for years. Difficulty breathing with certain triggers, wheezing, a history of eczema, and I've been rushed to the er multiple times almost completely unable to breathe. The doctor ran a test where, for 3 months, I would use a steroid inhaler to see if my symptoms improved. (yes they have)

My mother has always been in denial. She never wanted to accept the fact that I have a potentially life threatening disease that could last a lifetime. But she also absolutely despises narcotics, so fanatical that it bleeds into regular medicines. Also, she is extremely stubborn and will refuse to listen to anyone who does not agree with her.

She believes that my inhalers are causing my asthma. She told me that they are addictive, ams that if I had an asthma attack I could just rest for a while. She said ventolin was to only be used if I was on the verge of death. I obviously told her that she was a fucking idiot and that I wasn't going to endanger my own life because of her stupid fucking rules. It really angered me because  she had never experienced an asthma attack. She had never genuinely feared she would suffocate by the side of the road. She had never had to sleep in a plank position night after night. So I kept using the emergency inhaler secretly.

Today she caught me. I'd been recovering from flu (one of my triggers) and I was taking a few puffs so I could lie down to sleep when she came in. Oh what a fucking cluster fuck. She told me she finally realized I had a problem. Sounds good right?

Oh fuck no.

She said that asthma could never get better, only progressively worse and worse until I suffocated. She said I should ""stop inhaling chemicals"", she told me she didn't care what happened to me anymore because I would be dead soon anyway, and most importantly, she told me it was my fault I had asthma, and that I wouldn't have ""caught"" it if I had just wrapped up warm in winter.

I calmly explained to her that it was not my fucking fault I had asthma, but she didn't listen.

Mum: ""one day you're going to suffocate and there's nothing you can do to stop it.""

Me: ""actually there is. I can just take my steroid inhaler and take ventolin when I can't breathe. Do you have a better solution?""

Mum: ""I don't, I just know you have to stop taking medicine.""

The worst part is she's now trying to control me because of this. She says I won't be able to go on holiday because of this and she won't let my brother take me camping. I explained to her that I could just take the inhalers with me but she just told me to kill myself (her default argument when she has no answer)

I feel like I'm in an impossible situation, because my mother won't love me anymore if my asthma gets worse or if I take my inhaler, but it's completely out of my control and I feel like shit.",27Jan2019,1
4,"I finished my laundry about half an hour ago, but decided to come back in and just sit for a while. I’m fighting a cold or some bs, so I’ve been exhausted all day.

7,"I had a few bad things happen, mostly friendships and family, but I thought I'd moved on and everything would be fine.

It started when my parents argued, but instead of just ignoring them I listened, and I felt completely different for some reason. I felt there was a part of me missing, and the thoughts of everything in the past came back for me. I thought it would go away, but it's stayed like this for a while now, just the nagging feeling something is awfully wrong.

I doubted myself on long dead arguments. I thought about broken friendships. Before, I realised they were just bullying me and I left, but now it feels like I did something wrong, despite me not knowing what. I knew they would call me worthless and that they hated me, but somehow it feels like I was wrong, and I can't shake that feeling. I think about current friendships and about why anyone would want to be my friend at all, and I'm constantly scared they'll suddenly realise I'm an awful person, even though I can't figure out why they would think this. I feel like I've failed my parents, even though my grades are good. I've felt a terrible, aching sadness all the time these past few weeks. In the past i could have talked to some friends, but now I'm all alone if I want emotional support, so I'm just gonna put this on reddit and leave it.",27Jan2019,1
8,"It was a warm winter,  but we still had big snowpuffs from road cleaning, full of wet snow. On the side of the road there was a fresh roadkill cat, laying peacefully. It was whole,  no wounds,  no injuries, just a lifeless body. 
I stared at it for some time,  then looked on a tree with a crow nest,  where two birds sat and watched me staying near the corpse. I didn't want the crows to rip off the cat, since they actually could find food everywhere else. So I picked up snow stone from the road side and put it on the cat's body,  and another one, and another. When the snow pile was big enough to cover the whole corpse,  I beetled it hard to prevent the snow from  prayers attacks. 
It took me thirty minutes or so to bury this random cat whole in the snow. I wasn't able to ever find its body again. I hope now it rests in peace. ",27Jan2019,1
9,"This is similar to another post I made about being afraid of losing happiness when you have it.  So, after 7 years of depression, social anxiety, suicidal thoughts, and drug abuse.... I'm finally getting better.  I'm going to therapy and using mindfulness and meditation which has helped me tremendously.  The me 4 months ago is so much different from me now, for the better. However... 

Now I'm afraid of dying.  Before, I used to welcome the thought of dying.  I wanted to die almost all the time.  Now that I'm actually happy with my life... I'm afraid of losing it.  I'm afraid those seven years of barely eating, abusing drugs, chainsmoking, being sedentary, hardly any social interaction, etc. have shortened my lifespan, and I'm just overall afraid to die now.  I don't want to lose this. 

Does anyone else have a similar experience?  ",27Jan2019,1

12,"I’ll preface this saying I have social anxiety and I’m a freshman in college


I was looking forward to the weekend after working hard this week, but due to some circumstances It looks like I’m not gonna be doing anything. Before i came to college, I was afraid I was going to be like this 24/7, yearning for social interaction but too anxious to make friends and whatnot. Fortunately, I do have friends here and I’ve done relatively well.

But this is the first weekend I haven’t really done anything, and my chaotic mind (as usual) is catastrophisizing things. I’m afraid one friend group I’m in might be splitting, I’m worried about becoming my worst nightmare as a loner, and other things.

But I can’t sit back and let these thoughts consume me, but I don’t know what to do. I could go to the gym, but I have a bad back so I could only play basketball and run. I don’t know, and I feel like I’m rambling at this point, but it’s because I’m really anxious. I just don’t know what to do",27Jan2019,1
13,"So, I'm a sophomore in college. I live in an apartment a few blocks from campus. And I feel like I'm going to end up utterly alone.

Let me explain. I've been at this school for about a year and a half. And in that time, I made two close friends. Going to call them L and J. Outside of that, not much. There are a couple people that I talk with in one of the clubs I'm in (it's a Christian group, but really chill with basically zero judgment. We do movie nights once a week and services on Tuesdays) but I've never really spent time with them outside of that. I'm not really involved in any other clubs, which kills me because I really want to be but it's hard to join stuff if you don't do so at the start of the year.

Well, today L says she wants to split. I noticed I hadn't heard from her in over a week, so I texted her and asked if I'd done something to piss her off. She says absolutely not, but there's something she has to get off her chest. Says she's got too much going on and can't be dealing with a lot of friendships, so she wants to end things.

Alright, fine. I'm not going to push her. She does have a lot going on, she's dealing with a lot of issues. She's had a rough past. Fine. I made her promise she'll take care of herself, and make sure she knows that if she ever needs to talk, I'll be here. I hope she can get through it.  It's hard though, because she was one of the only people I could genuinely confide in. And I've helped her through a lot of bad shit since we met. And now she's gone. 

Honestly, I'm just not sure where to go from here. J is great, and he's my flatmate now that we're out of the dorms, but we don't really do a lot. And he gets out a lot more than I do, since he has a girlfriend and some other friends he's known for ages.

I've dealt with depression and some anxiety for a long time, and I thought I had it mostly under control. But I wasn't expecting something like this. I've lost a lot of friends over the years, but it was usually because my family got transfered. I had months of warning, and I knew I would be getting a fresh start.  Or they stabbed me in the back, and I would at least be angry at them. This is something I've never dealt with before. It came out of nowhere, and I can't be angry at her because I really want her to be ok. So what can I do?",27Jan2019,1
14,"It is more for learning Pinyin and how to speak it, but I like learning a language I find interesting since in my school there are no classes where you can learn another language and being able to learn new words little by little is amazing.

15,"So last night, there was an accident close to my house. It turned out it was between a semi and a pickup truck, where the semi swerved out of his lane to avoid hitting a car in front of him and slammed into my buddy. His name is Robert, and he was such a genuine guy. I want him to be remembered, he didn't talk to a whole lot of people. He had a darker sense of humor and he was insanely funny. I worked with him, and he was always doing the goofiest stuff. 

I'm also just going somewhere to vent, I'm just so sad that he's gone. He was supposed to graduate this year, he just turned 18 and I hate that that's gotten taken away from him.  My buddy Ryan last year shot himself junior year, and my other friends Van and JD drowned three months ago. I live apart from my family, and my sister has been really inconsiderate of the whole situation, so I came here for some support.

16,"So if you’ve been following my posts/post history, you know the story by now. Broken up with over cyberstalking situation. Don’t hear from ex for a couple days then eventually pry out of her that she’s seeing someone new. 10 days after saying she loved, missed me and was confused. 

Forgot I had the LSAT scheduled for today tbh. Struggled to sleep last night, got about 3 hours. Showed up, took the test, most of it actually was really easy and I finished most sections with 10 minutes to go. Section 5 was hard as shit, though. In the break times between sections and the 15 minute break I was legit consumed with thoughts about my ex. I have inner conversations in my head, I assume y’all do too. So what I tell myself: “dude, you’re torturing yourself. You can’t control this situation. Why she left, her seeing this guy, not replying to emails, having you blocked, etc, just relax. What’s meant to be will be” but the thoughts don’t go away, they persist. I still keep wondering what she’s doing, how she can just give off this air of being so fine and “happy” with someone she supposedly went on one date with and just started seeing. Then the replaying conversations starts “Mate, just relax you can’t change the past, it is what it is, you did all you can do” 

Still, they persist. I just don’t know what to do. If I can’t focus on a standardised 4 hour test because of this, idk what could take my mind off it. We’re now at 11 days without talking. Our longest period ever. Still, I hold out that I’ll see her name pop up on my phone just for a random conversation. I still pray every night for her grandmother, family and that God sends her back into my life somehow. “Why would you want someone who could treat you like this, walk out on you, act like you don’t exist, not check up on you, hurt you how she has? Dude you’re a great person” is what I reply to myself, still, the guilt persists. It’s like lady Macbeth trying to wash the blood off her hands. I really wouldn’t wish this pain on anyone. Yea love is great, it gives you the highest highs, but being vulnerable has a downside too. How do you become strangers with someone who’s seen your soul and knows everything about you?

20,"So my hubby and I are in our late-30's. I'm the wild one, he's the conservative bore (I love him, but I can only hear about mathematics for so long lol).

He never drinks over excess. Except this year, out with a few couples, I told him ""I wish you would cut loose a little. Just for once.""

He had a couple too many. Not so bad. Nice to see him be social.

As the clock was nearing midnight, I went outside looking for him. Where was he? I have to kiss my dork at midnight.

As the count reached 10, and he wasn't there, I heard our friends' laughter.

""HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!! WOOOOOOO!!!!!!""

There's my husband streaking down the street. Hands to the sky.

Buck-ass fucking naked.

My hubby. The one who never takes off his shirt in the pool. In his adorable birthday suit for all to see.

Not fat, but his round belly bouncing. His slight man-boobs bouncing. His bare white ass jiggling. And his penis flapping in the breeze.

I burst out laughing too. ""Hey Baby New Year, wheres your diaper, you're NAKED!""

He turned and looked at me in horror, almost like I snapped him out of a trance, covered his package with his hands sheepishly to loud laughter from our friends and ran towards the back door getting his naked ass in the house.

I now have 2 photos. One of my butt-naked husband, head to bare feet, mid-run, eyes wide, mouth open looking at the camera in horror. Dick and balls in the wind. And another of his cute plump ass running for cover into the house.

Whenever I bring it up he is MORTIFIED hahahaaaa.

22,"Over the last few years I’ve become totally and utterly lost...I’ve dedicated myself to a career path I went into without any real desire, but gained an interest in the process though it seems that I’m not so great at it, I can’t seem to find a willing mentor leaving me to my own devices.

 I’ve lost most of my meaningful relationship unknowingly in an attempt to try to better myself which has been unsuccessful, and at this point I’m not sure I have any friends. 

I’ve lost most of my drive to do pretty much anything. I’m trying to get in the mindset to reconstruct myself again but I’m just not sure if i can anymore... I’m almost 30 and i feel like my life is in shambles and don’t know how to keep it together.

Earlier this week i set an appointment to meet with a therapist because its just so hard for me to want to try to live life.  Everytime i try to take a step forward i wind up taking two steps back and every opportunity I have to form some type of relationship with someone new it ends up dissolving.

I’m genuinely a nice person but every environment I put myself in, I generate hostility towards myself. I blame it on my social anxiety/phobia which has manifested in neurological twitches that become harder and harder to manage which has led me to having difficulties even getting in the mindset of wanting to meet new people and in turn leads to me being ostracized by anyone who isn’t like myself in terms of race or gender.

25,"My dad was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer last October and was given only 6 months. The chemo and combination of food/natural herbs/will to live had him surpass that time; enough that they gave him a break from it for a while. It came back strong though and they decided to go with a stronger oral chemo. Two weeks later, he crashed. We thought he wasn’t going to make it and here I am, having driven 1000 miles back to see him with my new girlfriend in tow.

It was a series of good AND bad luck. I’m in a new job that immediately gave me 40 hours of vacation time which they had NO problem approving me for this event, but since that crappy October, my ex wife decided she didn’t want to be with me any more...then slept with my best friend at the time. I found out about that part while I was in the new location I moved to 4 hours away because I had my cousin get me a good job.

That didn’t last long because the owner was on the fence about keeping the place going. Meanwhile, I had learned about the affair which allowed me to move on. Cousin talked me into using Tinder at this point and after a series of not connecting, I almost gave up. Then...my girlfriend started talking to me. We met and from that point on, we’ve been together since. A real connection that I had never had with anyone happened and we had plans to come see my parents later on in the year.

Then the call that we all dread happened.

We were on the road home within a couple of days. I didn’t want them to meet her in these circumstances, but I wanted my dad, the closest person in my life to meet her. She agreed and took off time from her own new job.

It’s so bittersweet. I hoped that he’d beat the odds, which he still could, but it’s not looking likely. But...having him meet her and having his approval means so much for us, especially considering how much they didn’t like my ex. I’m not having to defend or deflect from her actions like I did with my ex; they just love her, and not just saying so.

I hope he gets through it and gets to meet his new granddaughters on our next trip home. Three girls that I have added to my own two. Both parents mention wanting to see their new “grand babies”.

I hope he gets a chance to and more, but if not, I’m happy that she came. While devastated, I’m happy with what has happened in the past year and that the man I respect most in life told me he’s proud of me.",27Jan2019,1

Several dr visits later we hear the worst news. One month after our shared birthday 5/22, I was born on her 30th bday. It was also one month after my engagement. 
She fought till the end.. even once they till her that the only help the treatment will help is future patients as her cancer cant be cured... she decides to continue the chemo, she tells me she doesnt want to die, she wants to continue life as plain an normal as it was. She fights to see one more day. 
My sister is finally able to get an emergency Visa, good for one week, as my mother is now on hospice, her Visa expires 4/19. 
The apartment is small, theres guests that disturb the peace staying in my moms old bedroom and my old bedroom has been set up for the hospice bed, xleaned and cleared. 
I'm(23) the youngest of 3 but was the most available to take care of mom. My oldest sister(34), still lived in out home country. We finally got see each other after 16 years. She tries her hardest to keep her composure but seeing cancer is different story than hearing about it. 
My brother, 31... I'm not sure how much he processed her death.. he was.. is? An alcoholic. During the very difficult times he chose to the bottle over my mom, despite all the time she dedicated most to him since he was always in some sort of problem or another. 
My mom starts sleeping more and more and my sister doesnt feel comfortable leaving.
I try to stay most of the day with mom but leave at night to be with my husband and dog.. I needed some comfort, I feel guilty but I have to leave. But I give her some small hit of ""peguere"",  indigenous word for pot. She never smoked it but after the symptoms couldn't be stopped with pills I tried all forms of thc  to make her most
comfortable. At the end all she wanted was to take a small hit from the cheap vape and take a nap. 
On the evening of 4/21, my mom no longer wakes up from her naps.. I stay the night. I'm about to get comfortable in the couch while my sister rest on the other. My dad is with my mom in the bedroom with the door open. 
Its midnight. 
I try to think of something to text my husband for his birthday as I lay in the couch as I  hear my moms breath slow down. 
I cant think of any, except of how life is so precious and we dont know it. I dont type anything. 
I suddenly hear my mom moan, she keeps it at it  and my sister an I look at each other an immediately look at each other and hurry to the bedroom. 
Her breath get slower, each breath is spaced out by several  seconds. 
We hold her and tell her to let go. To see her dad who had just passed not even 4 months before. 
That time she dreamt of him, she told me she was unsure if he was telling her to go on or to let go..... I tell her to go to him. 

She stops breathing. 

I remember what the hospital lady  instructed me to do when this happened and immediately follow her instructions.

I go out of the room and make the calls to the nurse. 

I come the room and my dad is crying about how she now has a smile on her face even though before she could no longer close her mouth. 


I try to find peace in that.

I had convinced myself that I was at fault for ruining a 10 month relationship. Right now I'm taking it easy and just coping with the fact that this happened to me. It's so easy to overlook red flags when you've got rose colored glasses on. Make sure you pay attention to the early signs of abuse and get help.

It's not really much but it's sort of pushed me to start doing things on my own! I feel less uncomfortable being out in public on my own, as well as walking places alone.

40,"I am 19(F), while he is 25(M). We are coworkers, temporary as I'm in his department for help for a while until they no longer need me, which now has been 2 months. He was my trainer throughout this, and I felt something that I didn't know what it was, but I knew I was interested, and started to pursue him. I didn't know what gave me the confidence to do so, but God did I like it. Year ago there was no way I would attempt  any of this.

I managed to easily get his snapchat, but everytime I attempted a casual 'hey let's go to the movies,' it was shrugged off. To be fair I said it jokingly, so I then attempted a more serious, ""you want to go to the movies with me?"" However, he told me he had a blind date, much to my disappointment.. So I was going to give up, but throughout this we texted frequently, a good 4 to 6 hours sometimes or so, and he did mention he was too 'lazy' to go on the blind date. So, I thought to push one last time.

""Well I'm going to see Aquaman tomorrow you want to come with?"" In all honesty I was going to go alone, but he said sure!! We made plans for Saturday where we would meet to watch. I enjoyed the movie, and as the movie theater was empty we were able to talk bits here and there, didn't feel awkward to me.

He mentioned after this we could also go watch the Escape Room. We were originally going for sushi, but he has to leave early due to needing to help his father, so I rementioned it and off we go. 

Before the movie starts he asks, ""is it alright we hang out more?"" I gave a rather confused and excited sure, but he hit me with ""you know what I mean right?"" My mind wasn't even thinking at this point and blurted out, ""you mean going out?"" I don't even remember what happened next because he turned my head and started to kiss me, and oh gosh, I know I sucked because I never kissed someone before. It felt odd... But I didn't hate it, and now I really wish I could kiss him.

Though we did talk while waiting for the movies, via holding hands, over our age difference. He said he was scared, and worried. He didn't want to hurt me, and also thought I should have someone more experienced. It's very clear I'm a virgin. He has dated someone, and honestly he was in my position as she was over 30. He was only 'somewhat' experienced, so I said we can experience it together. Albeit bit confused, I didn't go further on her as I was just really happy. I will definitely ask about her more.

So, we agreed to keep it out little secret for a while. To make sure we are comfortable enough with each other before telling out families, as mine would not be too happy.. They wouldn't forbid it or anything, but express their dislike over it, I think. He knows my brother, and mentioned my brother would definitely beat him up, but I highly doubt my stick-like brother could kick his ass

I'm very happy. 

I turned to a girl who only dreamed and tried dating (I did however, get asked on multiple dates or sometimes was too dense), to dating someone older then I.

I only shared with one person (except I gushed to online friends), as he supported me through this, and explained it's a secret. I will never tell my family or coworkers until it's time that we feel it's safe, because I imagine not many would approve of our relationship.

Its 2:45 and I been thinking about him since 11:30 or so.

It feels like a burden. A burden to yourself and others.. and so you remain distant hoping that one day you will decipher what it is that took the colors out of your life. What it was that made the sky turn grey. It feels honest.. yet it feels like the biggest lie. It feels like every action you do only aids to keep you in that dark state of mind. So You isolate friends. You hurt lovers. You kill off all your angels so you can make deals with the devil. You trade all blessings for sins. You tell yourself that the happiness you see in others is nothin but a facade, for true happiness is only relevent with the sorrow that follows it. You tell yourself the brighter the light the bigger the shadow casted and pray someone just might come save you and pull you out of this mess. but you feel thats too.much to ask of anyone. So You refuse any form of help, thinkin its only tempoary solution to a permanent problem. Worst of all in the back of your mind you still hold on to hope.. Hoping that one day. Maybe just one day, just like that; you will wake up and things will change. Just to see the night fall and you're back to devilish ways. And as time goes on It feels as if you become immune to pain so you challenge and proclaim ""if you wanna hurt me. Make sure i fucking feel it. Make sure i fucking suffer. Make sure it fucking makes me feel human."" Sometimes It feels like its the only answer to conquer death.. and so there you are with hollow breath... Surrounded by these 4 walls as you tell yourself.

46,"Friday is my sister's wedding day.  My entire family flies in from the pacific northwest to a large city in Florida.  My brother, due to legal and financial reasons, has no drivers license.  Also, he missed his flight Wednesday and so he stayed in a motel near the final destination airport on the first night.  My brother and I have never had the best of relationships.  Rewind ten years, I got a letter from a municipality warning me I had a warrant for my arrest, turns out he has been using my name and social all over the place.  He did time for his using my identity, but I digress.   Being the nice brother I am, and how close I am to his motel, pick him up and bring him to stay at my sister's house.  I have the guest room, he has the couch.  Day of wedding.  The original plan was I was gonna take him to and from the wedding.  I had a plane to catch at 5 am EST so needed to be up at 3, hence I would have to leave the wedding around 7, 730.  Plans changed to him taking a party bus with the groom to the wedding (which was beautiful and very well done) and he didn't make solid plans with me whether or not he needed me to take him home.  So off they go to the wedding early and I had time to kill, so I went and did my stuff cruising around Florida, I show up to the wedding 2 hours early, and lo and behold older bro is already hitting the sauce.  Mind you, this was kind of a ""country"" wedding, so all the beer was Natty Ice and Bud Light.   Time for the reception.  As the pastor is repeating a story out of the book of Esther, my brother says, ""That's not how that happened"", to which many people had to shush him.  I was absolutely embarrassed.  He's the kind of guy who likes to shmooze when he's drunk, so during the party he was hanging off all kinds of peoples shoulders ""HEYY HOW ARE YAA"" and shit like that.  Annoying drunk.  Overly confident.  It's also an outdoor venue, and it was pretty chilly even by PNW standards.  It's time for me to head back to my sisters house 50 miles south to get enough sleep for my red eye flight back home.  Half way to her house I get a call from him screaming at me for abandoning him and just leaving him there.  Swear to god, I forgot all about him.  His screaming and calling me an ass hole really endeared me to turn the car around to go pick him up.  Not.  I continued on figuring either he would get a ride from one of my parents (divorced) or go stay at their hotels which were not far away.  I get to her house, feed the dogs for her, lock the doors, and go to sleep around 8.  Then it happened.

Jesus fucking Christ someone is trying to kick down the fucking door.  I wake up, fly to the front door knowing full well it's him and open the door.  He puffs his chest out and first words are, ""you're a fucking piece of shit ya know that, make me spend 100 on an uber"" and shoves me into my sisters wall leaving a nice dent.  So I grabble with him and take him to the ground shouting at him to Stop, knock it off, etc.  He is COMPLETELY drunk.  (btw, he was cutoff at the open bar, but I kept seeing him with more drinks later)  We're fighting, I sock him in the face pretty good but his alcohol rage has him going no quit.  So I retreat back to the guest room.  He manages to put me in a choke hold, somehow I'm able to kick him off me and shut the door and lock it.  I call the police and ask for them to come.  He's yelling at me that I'm a pussy, a faggot, no one in the family loves me, on and on it went.  Then it clicked.  He knew he fucked up.  The water works kicked into over drive as he knew he would be going to jail for assaulting me.  ""You wouldn't send your brother to jail would you?!""  ""I thought we were really getting along!""  ""You're a Christian!  You're supposed to forgive me!""  After a little bit of investigating by the police, they arrest him and take him to jail.  My Mom is currently mad at ME for having called the police (fuck you mom).  My brothers rap sheet is a mile long.  I have long advocated for my brother.  When he's been homeless I've tried guilting one of parents to take him in or do something to remedy his situation.  After this latest display of selfishness and childish behavior, I can resoundingly say, fuck you brother.  You've never been a brother to me.  In name only.  Get some help.  You're an alcoholic.  And you're a piece of shit.

Last night I went to a barcade and I’m sure I had my drink spiked. I pregamed a little and had 3 drinks there, but I completely blacked out for the second half of the night and felt way more drunk even though I had stopped drinking. Luckily I was with my guy friends, I’m pretty sure whoever it was saw me meet back up with them and decided it wasn’t worth it. I only remember flashes of the night, one of them being falling all the way down the stairs, fucking up my ankle and elbow and tailbone. 

I know I was ultimately lucky and nothing worse happened to me, but I can’t shake the feeling that something almost really bad happened. Anyways I’m annoying my friends and family going on about this, I’m pretty sure a couple people think I was just really drunk, but I know my body and I drink enough to know I did not consume enough to blackout like that.

The book falls into the instructive/mentoring category. It almost feels like the author is sitting on your shoulder and telling you what you need to hear, not what you want to hear. He suggests that any amateur who wants to turn pro must start thinking, behaving and doing all the things that a pro does. It’s not about the desire to become a pro but the effort that goes into becoming a pro that matters.

Before I finished reading this book, I made the decision to stop toying with the idea of starting my own investor newsletter and to begin the process of turning pro. Many books may inspire you to think differently, but not all books can propel you to take action. Turning Pro does both.

I sort of have a soft “rivalry” with Brandon at my school. He’s a 6'5 frat guy who plays football, and I’m a 5'7 calculus nerd.

He mentioned that his best subject is history, and I said “Well it’s my worst, but I’ll still score higher than you at your best.”

He said why not make it interesting? Whoever gets the highest score on the midterms gets to make the loser do whatever they want that night.

I said “Are you crazy?! You’re on!”

I barely even studied. I got a 97.

All day I couldn't wait to see him. I was going to have him bow on his knees, kiss my bare feet and tell everybody I was the smartest genius he ever met (and I am).

My face went white in shock when he showed me his 98.

Okay fine, what stupid thing do I have to do?

He said “No big deal, Martin. You just have to run across the football field tonight at midnight.”

“Okay fine.”

“Naked.”

My face turned red and my jaw dropped as everyone around him laughed.

“Yeah, right. Haha. What do I really have to do?”

He said “You have to run across the football field at midnight tonight. Butt-naked. Not even socks.”

A cute girl said “Oh baby! I know my plans tonight!” and laughed as I struggled for air.

Even my friends Heather (just a friend, she has a BF) and Jason laughed.

Again, I am a huge geek. Obviously a virgin.

""You're not serious are you?""

And at midnight that night, there I was. With about 10 cheering students on each side of me, standing at the endzone of the football field. I took a deep breath, closed my eyes, and dropped my fluffy, white robe to the ground.

There I was, running across my own college football field.

As naked as the day I was born.

Wearing nothing but my glasses and the pink blush on my cheeks.

I am lily-white from the neck-down. Just a smattering of hair on my chest and stomach.

Not fat but a “studies-while-eating-Doritos” Freshman 15 rounded belly shaking as I ran. My “bigger-than-you’d think”, very bare bubble butt jiggling behind me. And left pathetically hiding my (admittedly small) penis and balls with my hands, embarrassingly feeling them flop around in my palm and I desperately tried to hide them from anyone's gaze.

About a dozen students, Brandon's friends and a few of mine, screaming ""WOOOOO!!!! Check out that BUTT!"" and laughing.

There I was. The respected 4.0 Dean's List scholar.

Running as naked as a newborn baby into the brisk night air with cell phone's snapping away and students laughing hysterically.

The loudest roar of laughter was when I ran back past Brandon and he said ""Look everybody, it's the genius!"" and SPANKED my naked ass hard as I yelped out loud.

Not only was the spank LOUD, not only did he perfectly get me across both bare cheeks, but oh my goodness did it STING.

The freedom of expression and mutual respect in certain communities seem to have dissappeared. This, unfortunately, is nothing but toxic.

65,"I'd been with my GF for 9 months

A couple of weeks ago I wake up to a text from her saying me following a girl on instagram makes her want to kill herself

I'd been following this girl for years, I used to be friends with her but we don't talk now, I don't like her pictures of interact with her. My GF had mentioned once previously when we first got together that she didn't like me following her because she's attractive but I said that seemed a bit too controlling :/ (I said it in the nicest way possible)

So we end up having a phone call because of the text where I tried to rationally explain that I don't think it's fair to control someone's life down to who they can and can't follow on social media (I'm not a very jealous person, I didn't care if she hung out with ex bf's etc so it's not like I'm a hypocrite) my GF became hysterical and broke up with me because in her eyes if wouldn't do something as simple as unfollow someone for her I was a cold cunt

It was all quite shocking to wake up to, very surreal, About 30 minutes later of thinking about it I realised that despite thinking she was wrong for asking me to do it, if she was that upset I should have done it so she could calm down and we could have talked about it more calmly later

2 days go by before we talked again, we ended up talking for a long time and I basically said the above, I'm sorry, I handled it badly etc and I finished it getting quite emotional, unfollowing the girl and saying I love you; things seemed back on track

The next couple days we were interacting pretty much normally but she did say a couple times when I said nice things to her ""hey, we aren't officially back together you know that right? I still need time"" I said oh, of course, if I step out of line feel free to tell me

More days go by, things seem to get better everyday, she's telling me she loves me, I'm planning to go see her (she doesn't live nearby) then she texts me at night seemingly out of the blue

(I'm paraphrasing, this is a string of texts) ""Hey, I told you I needed more space, you don't respect me, you told me you loved me on the phone after our fight and that was totally inappropriate""

I was pretty hurt by this, I told her if I was being too much just let me know and she hadn't said anything, the way she had acted was quite the opposite so how had I not respected her? I was also very hurt that she made me feel like an idiot for telling her I loved her after our fight, I was emotional, I didn't know if things would be ok again and then when they seemed to be I was very happy about that and I really do love her :(

When someone upsets me I don't retaliate, I don't say anything mean or spiteful, I explain what has upset me and why and I go a bit cold, emotionally take a step back from them because I'm hurt

The trouble with the argument above is despite me saying what bothered me, she felt like she had come to me with a problem and id been a dick about it

If she has said ""Hey, I know we've seemed good for the past few days but I still need a bit of space, is that ok?"" I would have said, yes, of course, but the ""you don't respect me"" aka it's all your fault and making me feel stupid for saying I loved her were the problems

The next couple days we talked, I was jovial but a couple times she said stuff like ""It's cold I need a cuddle :("" and instead of being lovey dovey ""oh baby I will come cuddle you all up"" etc I was just like ""yes it is cold isn't it""

As said above, I was like this because I was hurt and was made to feel stupid for loving her

She got angry at me for not being sweet and told me not to talk to her again until I could be nice, I said ok

Two days later we haven't talked, she calls me upset saying me not talking to her and being cold has given her sever anxiety and she can't sleep or eat

When she's telling me this, I don't know what to say, I'm still feeling emotionally cold towards her and I don't feel like id done anything to her for her to feel that bad

I think the problem is when she's telling me how bad she feels it's like she's saying ""YOU have made me feel like complete shit, YOU did this"" and I got a bit defensive instead of feeling sorry for her

She then tells me she hates me, how ugly I am, that I'm a loser, sexually inadequate, cruel, cold, evil, I will never find anyone again etc basically trying to strip away any confidence I have in every aspect of life

I let her do it because I felt like if she needed to let out all that anger it would be wrong for me to stop her. After she hung up I was shaking, was the worst roasting of my life and by the person I love the most

Since then she has continued to be very cruel, she's posting on her social media about me and laughing with her friends (I know I shouldn't look but it's kind of hard not to)

Despite the above, I still text her and apoligised for everything I felt id done wrong, she called me delusional, I asked to call her, she agreed, but on the phone she refused to accept she did anything wrong, she feels 100% justified in all the nasty things she's said to me because I didn't care about her when she was hurting

When I try and explain why I was like that, she tells me I'm autistic, I'm a snowflake and delusional, she's totally unwilling to accept any fault

It's so hurtful

Maybe in a few months she will look back and realise this hasn't been fair, or maybe I am just delusional, feel free to tell me straight.",27Jan2019,1
66,"I have the opposite of anger issues; I never get angry. This has been true for all my life. Since I was little, I was never really given a chance to throw a tantrum and when I did got bitch slapped in the face with “all the things we did for you!” from my parents so I always bottled up my anger until I no longer felt anger. “Just how little anger do you feel?”, you ask? I once got choked by a classmate when he snapped and I didn’t feel an ounce of anger and kinda felt sorry for the guy for losing it; he apologized, and I accepted it.
When I feel really frustrated and get on the verge of anger, I just end up crying and drown in self pity- after a good crying, I go back to normal again. My friend thinks it’s unhealthy for my mental state, but even if I did become angry I am at a loss of what to do when you’re angry and that frustration ends up with me crying. Also, due to this strange patience of mine, I can’t really gauge what triggers people to become mad because I literally cannot relate to easily angered people, and this makes me socially awkward at times.

71,"I feel like most of us thinks we're in the bottom percentage of happiness and that almost everyone else is on the top, but in reality, the vast majority of us is probably just around the middle. The more people I get to know, the more I realize that everyone has problems and flaws and worries. Problems I really wouldn't want to have.

The other day I sat down and became sad over the fact that I could only recall a few periods of time in my life where I felt very happy all the time. All only lasting a maximum of maybe a month or two. But the more I learn about the world, the more I think that this is very normal. You aren't meant to be happy all the time, and I think it makes a lot of people more ashamed and sad to think that they are. 

Don't get me wrong. I'm actually (or have started to be) a pretty positive person. I like to see the best in every situation and I've started to really make joy out of the smaller things in life. But it kinda... brings me peace and satisfaction to think like this. That it's completely normal to not feel at peace or satisfied.

74,"So the past couple of days, I made a few posts about the man who killed my family in a DUI being released. I ended up deleting 'm because I felt like I kinda wrote them in an uproar of anger and disbelieve and I just needed a place to vent.


It's kind of a weird thing knowing that he's actually out now. A fellow Redditor noticed one of my older comments, saying that he was released a few years ago and up until I received my letter this week, I honestly thought he was out before. A couple of years ago, I got a letter informing me that this guy was released, which turned out to be incorrect. Don't really know why I got the letter. The only thing I know it that they just recently (read: since a couple of years) started informing victims (or their family) whenever someone was (filing for) released. I guess someone messed up or their system wasn't working as it should. But he's out and walking around for real, apparently. 


I deleted the previous posts since I wrote them without actually thinking rationally about my emotions and just spew forth my thoughts. I guess that isn't a bad thing, but thinking back I might have been too overwhelmed to clearly write out my thoughts about this man being released. So, coming back on all of that (and after a last-minute therapy session) here's my more reasoned out thoughts and feelings.


I'd say that 60% of what I am feeling is fear. Fear for different reasons. I am afraid that he might hurt people again. He probably had to go into therapy for his drinking, which is a good thing I guess, but there's still that fear he might relapse. I've never had an addiction or been close to someone who had an addiction, but I can imagine fighting that urge is a living hell. So if he manages to keep down the bottle, that's amazing. I don't know if saying ""I'm proud of him"" for not drinking is appropriate, I'm not feeling proud, but there is this weird feeling that secretly hopes he no longer consumes any alcohol.


Another part of me is afraid of running into him. He isn't allowed to contact me, nor do I want to be in touch with him, but I know he lived around the neighborhood I grew up in and, even though I live in the city now, I am scared to death of bumping into him. I know chances are astronomical but I'm just thinking *what if?*. I know it will depend on how he acts. I remember he was all smug and didn't care when his sentence was pronounced so I am afraid he might still be acting like a jerk. If he does, I'd probably get insanely angry, though I am not the violent type. Me being angry consists of bottling up rage and just not responding to anything the person says and releasing all of it when I'm back home. Like, shouting and complaining about the way he acted in stead of actually harming him. I guess that's a good thing but not really healthy I guess to hold in all that anger.


Even is he'd be nice, I think I'd be cold as ice and distant. I have nothing to say to this man, but at the same time I want him to know how he fucked up my life. He probably doesn't care or doesn't want to know. I just want him to know and understand the pain and suffering I had to go through because of what he did. I just want him to know and maybe even feel guilty. I know it's a bit weird, demanding him to feel a certain way, but I went through hell and I need him to know.


The other 40% of emotions that are going on inside my head are disbelieve and rage. I'm in disbelieve because he was released because of good behavior. The one thing that still makes my blood boil is the smug grin on his face when he was told he got 20 years. So indifferent, so detached from this world. Like he was just told he gotten a free holiday in Ibiza. He didn't even care. For a long time I genuinely thought he was crazy. What kind of person just smiles when he is found guilty of three counts of manslaughter? Like, why? Even thinking about it now makes me filled with rage.


Speaking about rage, part of me is so angry he's still out again. I know everyone deserves a second chance and I know a big part of me wants him to get his life back on tracks, fully understanding what he did. But on the other hand, I want him to stay behind bars for the rest of his life. He took my parents away. He took my little sister away. He is the reason why I need a prosthetic foot to walk around and he is the reason I see my scarred face and skin every time I look in the mirror. 

I went through a dark phase during my teenage years and part of me was hoping every day that one of his fellow inmates ignited the bed he was sleeping on just so he knew what burning alive feels like. I'd never wish pain or suffering on someone now, since I know what that consists of, but part of me still wants him to know what it is. I'm not saying he should undergo the same things I did, part of me does want him to feel the pain of fibers melting in your skin or how fucked up it is to have phantom pains and feeling you're going insane for having pain in a limb you no longer have.


It all boils down to the fact that I don't really know what to feel exactly. Fear, anger, disbelieve, rage,... it's all going on in my head right know. Part of me wished I didn't know he was back out again, just for some peace of mind.

77,"I've always dealt with depression, but it's been especially bad for the past few years. I lost a very important person to me last February and have felt like life would never be worth living again since then. I managed to drag myself through the day to day and find things to do in my spare time. Studying, mostly, and freelance writing projects. But I felt so alone. I wanted company and someone to talk creatively with.

I found an amazing person through a writer's channel on discord. We spent two weeks planning this epic story together and now we're writing it. Only I don't feel like I can quite match her quality. It's a genre that she's been writing for ten years, and I've only just started. The whole thing was MY idea. I had been reading a book with similar themes before we began and really wanted to explore some of them on my own. As much as I love seeing what she writes, I feel like I'm not contributing equally and the quality of what I do contribute is maybe half or a third as good as what she writes. She is super nice and I love talking to her, and she's said multiple times that she feels the same and finds herself counting down the hours and minutes until I get home so we an go wild. I know she'd reassure me if I told her how I was feeling, but I don't think it's healthy to make her responsible for my feelings, nor would it be fair to her. I already told her once when I was upset because I felt like I didn't deserve the quality she gives me. And while I know that she does it out of love and because she's excited and enjoys writing this genre, the sense of shame I feel when I look at the disparate levels of quality in each of our contributions is only getting stoked more and more by every piece I receive from her.

I was feeling pretty confident in my abilities before. I don't know if I'll ever be able to match hers. If I thought I could improve quickly, I wouldn't have a second thought about just pushing through. But I'm worried that my confidence will degrade more and more overtime, leaving me with no self-esteem at all, making it harder to work and be successful with my other writing probjects.

I'm wondering if it would be better to be honest with her and see how things go, look for a sensitive way to end things, or just hang in there and not burden her with my low self-esteem. Either way I've been crying more than I usually do, these past few days. Super disappointed in myself.",27Jan2019,1

Also I need to say that she has mental health problems.

We became so tight that I know her routines, people that suffer of OCDs have things that they must do in their way and there is absolutely nothing wrong with it.

Anyway lately she has tried to isolate me from everyone else, my boyfriend, my friends, basically anyone that can interfere with me and her.

I don’t know if this is something she is doing to cope with the illness or she really wants me to be alone with her and her only.

I don’t want to be bad with her and make her suffer but I am afraid that what she is doing might be some “red flags”.

81,"Emotional rant (if this doesn’t belong here let me know)

Every time me and my boyfriend get into a fight I just cry the entire time. I really try not to. I’ve been this way most of my life and with my ex it was quite worse because there were some situations in which he had abused me. My current bf makes points about how we can never talk about anything because I get so emotional and I really try my hardest not to. (I’m crying right now as I type all this.) 

I can honestly say I even agree with him 9/10 when we get into an argument about something but sometimes I just can’t take it and I get upset and cry because he sits there and berates me and calls me pedantic. I’ve told him so many times that the way he talks to me is part of the reason I start getting emotional and cry but that doesn’t seem to matter. If I mention my feelings it means that I’m making his obsolete so I feel like I can even properly express myself ever. 

There are times when I’m trying to talk and he cuts me off. For some reason this just messes me up. I end up repeating sentences constantly and then he will get mad that I repeat myself too much but I can never seem to even get the finished sentence out of my mouth. I begin to stutter and I try to start from the beginning but it becomes a never ending loop. 

I just wish he would realize how just plain mean and angry he gets to me. I feel like I’m being cornered with nowhere to run with his tone of voice alone. It’s hard to even focus on his words when it feels like hatred. I don’t know. Maybe I feel emotions too much. Maybe I just have a weak spirit. Ive tried to tell him how he talks to me but I haven’t seen a change so every argument is the same. 

I just wish I could stop being so emotional. I don’t know how I haven’t drowned myself in my own tears yet. I would prefer our relationship not end as he makes me 1000x more happy than the times I cry when we fight. I’m pretty sure at this point crying is my bodies fight or flight when it comes to arguments. Obviously being flight. 

I don’t know what to do with myself. I think I love this boy. I’m not in love with him though. I don’t know how to explain. I know he cares for me. He really is the sweetest when we aren’t arguing. He’s helped me trough so much and every now and then when I look at him I feel like I could spend my life with him. I only know how he feels though. I’m too afraid to ask. I don’t want him to run away or feel trapped. 

I’m sorry Reddit. This is just a emotional rant but I had to get this off my chest. Half of it might not make any sense as I’m not really in a proper headspace right now. I just needed some kind of release.

82,"Some people just aren't worth the effort. 

I had someone who I thought was a really good friend. I remembered their birthday. I remember their allergies, their favourite sweets. The amount of words they put into a certain project that they were happy with. Everything, really.

She wouldn't put that effort in, but I figured it was OK because I would talk to her lots anyways (Almost everyday, classes together). She constantly forgot my birthday (Over 5 years of them). 

I ended up getting my signals mixed up and asked her out for a date. She rejected me, of course, and then I realised that she wasn't all that nice to me, ever. She would constantly put me down, make me feel terrible about myself, and would just be a shit person. She would never stick up for me when one of her friends would bully me.

I just gave up trying to befriend her in that instance. She thinks it's because I asked her out and she rejected me. But it's really because she's an awful person. I've never told her this, of course, because it's such a mean thing to say to someone.

Occasionally, she to butt herself into my conversations, but I just act dry to her, with 2 word responses, usually ""Ok thanks"". I used to volunteer in a charity shop that helped people with cancer, namely families with small children, as I needed the work experience and no-one would hire me without the experience or references. She commented once that it wasn't a real job, and I shut her down really quick with that.

I did get petty revenge once. Every class period, she complains about being hungry. She complains a lot, and multiple times, constantly. It really got in my mind, because I could predict what she was going to say and when she was going to say it. So I brought in her favourite sweets (Haribo Strawbs; the ones from Poundland), and as soon as she mentioned being hungry, I opened the bag up and started eating them in the lesson, never offering her one, but offering the mutual friend between us a couple. I didn't make a big deal out of the fact I had them, and I wasn't rubbing them into her face or anything.

Ok so a little about myself, im the youngest of 3 brothers, and while growing up, I didnt have many friends and was pretty much the quiet guy in class, until i was 16-17ish, when I started having a little more confidence about myself and managed to get more friends and go out more often (take in account that the legal drinking age in my country is 18, and most dance clubs allows you to enter at that age), and while most of my friends managed to hook up with someone, I was always the guy that went home alone, which, at that age bummed me but was not much of a struggle, because I told myself ""Well, im not that good looking so that must be the reason no one gets to like me"". So fast forward to my current age, I still cant get to get intimate with anyone, I know im, in average, good looking ( Because friends tell me so, and my confidence about myself is a bit higher), but I cant seem to approach a girl and ask her if she wanna dance, because im afraid that, if we get further down, we might end in something else, which is something I want to, but in the moment to take action I always let down.

Hell,even when my friends told me a girl likes me, and I like her, when im next to her in the dance club I just cant seem to take the initiative, even if Im alone with her, I always try to stay in a group because the simple fact of being with her makes me uncomfortable.

So my question is, how can I improve this ? How Can I manage to overcome this fear of intimacy?

For over a year now I've been in a slump. Which sounds ridiculous to say, because on the outside, I have friends, family, a degree, a great job, etc. etc. But mentally, I'm suffering. 

Due to the nature of my job, I'm solo quite often and will spend entire days without even talking to anyone. I do my best to get out, sit in public places, workout at the gym, volunteer, and invite friends to spend time together. But no matter what, I'm still left with this emptiness in me. 

I've also been plagued with OCD this past year. Despite not being especially religious, I'm struggling with a deep fear of hell and am constantly worried that my past actions may have hurt people, or that God will punish me for the choices I make. This anxiety has been exhausting and scary and I feel like a terrible person every day even though I try to be the nicest person I can be to everyone. I'm working with a therapist on these issues, but it's still tough. 

I lost some relatives who I was very close to this past year. I also split up with my girlfriend (of 2 years) over a year ago, but still think about her often. She was my first relationship and I became very attached. I feel so pathetic to still be thinking of her, especially since I'm pretty sure she 's been in and out of a long-term relationship already, and I still haven't gone on a single date. Anytime I see her photos on social media she looks beautiful as ever and I feel filled with loneliness and depression. I doubt she even thinks of me. 

Despite my outward success, I feel terrible. And I feel guilty for feeling upset because I know some people would kill to be in my position. I count my blessings everyday, but it's just hard to see the light sometimes. I'm doing my best to keep my head up. I hope I can find some purpose and peace soon.

same way I do for her. If I do post these on some random form Be sure to note that all these words

are just random things that pop into my head that I don't say. The main reason I don't say anything 

is because there is no one to talk to. I don't think they would appreciate just big paragraphs of my 

life story or anything. I might turn this into a video thing as well but I don't know yet.

I probably will post this somewhere I don't know where yet tho. About that girl I've been talking to

Her name is Lilly as said above and I've caught feelings for her. That can be a good or bad thing 

as I think she may have feelings for another guy. I don't know either way I want her to be happy

god that sounds stereotypical. I'm an odd guy but not  ""different"" from most guys. I'll go onto

a topic and get off of it 3 seconds later. I talk a lot thats another thing. Lilly is special.

In her own way of course. What do I like about her the most? Her laugh 100%. Her laugh is like no 

other. The type where if she laughs not one person in the room will be sad. That sounds cliche but

like I said she different. Oh look at that she just snaped me. On snapchat xD. anyways one sec

K back anyways I'm siting her thinking of what to say next. I asked her if she was tired from yesterday

or just been bored all day and she said both. I went with her, her mother, and her brother to his brothers

hockey games. It was nice I enjoyed it. I don't know if she did or not I would hope she did but do you

really think I would ask that? Naw theres no way some questions are odd to ask and thats one of them.

My hands are getting cold and more shaky I have no clue why. It was like yesterday when I went to lunch

My hands just randomly started shaking I thought It was because of all the sugar but I can'... never mind I

just realized I'm eating a jolly rancher so maybe thats why. Idk anyways

92,"I'm almost 40. I wanted to do other things with my life than what I am doing now. 20 years ago, big plans. Hopes. Excitement about the future. A life that would have involved international travel and a fair amount of intellectual stimulation. 

Now I'm unemployed, cannot find work, and my ambitions are in the gutter. There's no reclaiming them; I have too much debt and I can't upend my life to try. It would be unfair to my wife to try. I have literally no more ambition. At this point, I'm hoping only for the type of job that would have been simply a stop gap for me 20 years ago. I fucked it up, and I don't really know how or why. I just fell off for some reason. ",27Jan2019,1
93,"(TL:DR at bottom)

For 7 years I had depression, social anxiety, substance abuse, suicidal thoughts/idealizations/3 ""serious"" attempts.

I knew I couldn't commit suicide after my last attempt.  I realized it would be too devastating for my family and the few friends I had left.  For a few years I just felt trapped by them, and even resented them for loving me.  This was also the time where my substance abuse got significantly worse.  No self control, no conscience, etc.  I figured if I had to live, I might as well be messed up.  This lasted until I realized I'd be dead by an overdose if I didn't stop (I was combining a lot of depressants, and was about to move on to harder drugs), and how would that be less devastating for my family?  It wouldn't be.

When I realized this, I knew I had to get sober.  I somehow had the self-will to quit everything cold turkey.  Copious amounts of alcohol, all sorts of prescription pills (opiates, benzos, adderal, etc.), even cigarettes.  The withdrawal was bad, but I had controlled my use to where I didn't have to go to inpatient rehab.  I had recently befriended some people and it made it to where harder drugs were easily available, and I knew if I didn't quit what I was doing right then I would move on to heroin and meth.  So I did.  And I was sober for 3 months.  Then I drank for half a year.  Then I finally wised the fuck up and stopped wallowing in my self pity.

If I was going to continue living, I might as well make it better.  I was tired of drinking, tired of stagnating.  At this point my social anxiety was at it's worst.  I couldn't function at all out in public.  I started getting delusions from my isolation.  I knew I had to get help.  So I went to therapy, and treated my anxiety.  This paired with mindfulness and meditation completely got rid of my depression.  I still have moderate social anxiety, but it has improved so so much.  I can function in soceity again.  4 months of this has made me to where I don't want to die anymore.  In fact, where as I desperately wanted to die in the past, I am now afraid of losing my life, because I'm enjoying it so much.

This is all because I knew if I did commit suicide, my family would be destroyed.  I could never do that to them.  So if you're ever suicidal, don't kill yourself, then do a lot of drugs, then get better.... or just... get better.  Realize how devastating it would be for the ones who love you.  If you think no one loves you, that's a symptom of depression.  Of course someone loves you, and if you really believe you have no one, message me, I'll love you.  BOOM TRAPPED, CAN'T KILL YOURSELF.  It took a long time to get where I'm at right now, but I can't stress enough how glad I am that I didn't end my own life.

(TL:DR)  Someone loves you, it would devestate them if you killed yourself, you gotta live this life, might as well make it a good one, things can get better)",27Jan2019,1
94,"I have asperger's syndrome and have never really understood emotions all that well, or how to deal with them. When my girlfriend is upset, I usually give my direct opinions and how I think the issues can be resolved or mitigated, which... Doesn't really end up with her being happy. I've tried rubbing her back or just sitting there, but it feels so awkward like I'm not doing anything meaningful and that she thinks I don't want to be there. Also, we have been together 7 years, but I have never seen a point in marriage. People always tell me it means you're dedicated to that person only, but isn't that what a normal relationship is for? If I didn't plan to spend my life with her, why would I have went out of my way to be with her?  And kids? Why would I ever want that financial and emotional drain? What actual gain is there? It all seems so superfluous to me, and my viewpoints are starting to rub off on her and she's been getting depressed about it, which stacks onto my depression I've been hiding from her. I can't take it much more but I don't want to give up on this, what am I doing wrong?",27Jan2019,1
