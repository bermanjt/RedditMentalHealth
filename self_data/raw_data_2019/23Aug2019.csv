2,"I have slowly deleted all of my social media. I never got over 100 followers on Instagram or over 100 friends on Facebook. I somehow got tired of trying to be relevant. I only use Snapchat to ‚Äúvlog‚Äù small things I am doing to my close friends. But also Snapchat stories fries my brain.

And that‚Äôs how I feel about social media. It so tiring. I can‚Äôt take on how hard people try. Ever since I attempted to end my life, I began disliking social media so much more. I began liking birds, mycology, bullet journaling. I like art, make up, coding and taking pictures of the clouds. 


I feel boring because I don‚Äôt share anything on social media, I don‚Äôt update profile pictures or post life updates. I don‚Äôt post accomplishments. I started hating alcohol and super loud places. 

I used to be the opposite 5 years ago. 5 years ago I was 17. I am not sure I am aging, or maturing.

3,"My boss and I do not communicate well. We produce great work but have very different communication styles. This week she blindsided me by saying she thinks my demeanor has changed, I have frequent work errors, and I take vacation during peak business times. Although surprised by this meeting I had explanations for all of her accusations and email documentation. 

She also opened this meeting with, I‚Äôm not sure if you are applying for other jobs (I‚Äôm not I work for the state), she does not see value in me or my work. This was very hurtful as I love my job and have received numerous accolades. 

I want to reach out to HR for a mediator to help our communication but also bring up some of these bullying things she‚Äôs been doing to me and none of her other subordinates. Thoughts?",23Aug2019,2

5,"I (20M) feel very attached to my friends. I have a good circle of friends and we all hung out a lot this summer. But I get the feeling that I bother them too much. I'm always texting at least one of them and if they're all busy I get lonely and sad. Even when I myself am busy like at work I try to get a glance at my phone to see if any of them responded and it makes me feel clingy. I'm not sure why this started or when, but I know that I used to be okay with alone time and not doing anything for a couple of hours. I haven't ever had a girlfriend before but maybe that's what I need? Because it also makes me sad to think about how they never really text me first or might leave me on read. I know that they like me as a friend, I'm not worried about that part, but it does bother me that I feel like maybe I am more invested in the friendships than they are. Maybe I just need another group of friends that share the same feelings about friendship as me? But at the same time, I would like to be more independent in the sense that I would be okay with not talking to anyone for a few days, and not have the urge to always be with someone. I'm not sure if that even makes sense, but any sort of advice would be great",23Aug2019,3

Basically 7,8,9 = A-A**
5,6 = B-, B
4 = C

Last year in my mock exams I was on a grade 2 for maths, not even a pass. I was convinced that there was no way in hell I was going to pass maths, I thought there was a 100% chance that I‚Äôd have to retake my maths exam in college.

My friends, teachers and family were so supportive of me and they genuinely believed that I could pass and I thought that I‚Äôd end up disappointing them.

I was hoping for a 4, a standard pass in maths like I thought that that was the best I was capable of achieving though, I thought it was incredibly unlikely.
I remember having breakdown upon breakdown over maths thinking I was going fail and disappoint everyone who ever believed in me. After my final maths exam I cried for 2 hours because I thought I fucked it up so bad.

WELL GUESS WHO GOT A GRADE 5!!!! Never in my life did I expect myself to be able to jump from a 2 to a 5 I‚Äôm so shocked and proud of myself. I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to do it if it weren‚Äôt for my wonderful teachers and family and friends like honestly if it wasn‚Äôt for them I would‚Äôve completely given up.

So I‚Äôm super proud of myself ahah I cried like 10 times today because I was so ecstatic and the joy on my maths teacher‚Äôs face omg!!

And I‚Äôm super happy because I would‚Äôve settled for a 4 but it would‚Äôve made it harder for me to get onto my psychology A-Level course I want I do at college. A 5 was exactly what I needed and I‚Äôm so so so proud of myself that I got it. I‚Äôm gonna cry some more ahahaha x",23Aug2019,5

There were a number of different factors and with out shitting too much on the hospital I work at, it was just time to *GO*.

My boyfriend and I had been talking about me making a jump into travel nursing. I had always wanted to do it, but never had for many different reasons. It was the time finally. We decided that Nashville, Tennessee would be our dream first place to go. After a few road blocks, I ended up taking an assignment in my current license state, just far enough away to be considered a traveler for 13 weeks. I start September 9th.

While doing all that, I had been working on getting my Tennessee nursing license and I just got the email that my license application been approved!

I'm just so proud of myself for making this jump and staying on top of all the work required of me to not only get a new nursing license, but to change jobs. It's a very different feeling to be proud of myself for something and not self deprecating like I usually am üòÄ",23Aug2019,2

28,"I was just about to fall asleep when - long story short - I came to the discovery that my sister is sleeping in her room with someone *other than her boyfriend*, some guy she met and got drunk with yesterday. 

I'm genuinely surprised at my own reaction. It is as if I was doing it myselfbor... I don't know. It hurts anyway. Not sure why. Not my life, I barely see her and I take no responsibility for her self-immolation. Cruel as it may sound for she is my sister and all, but I never give support or advice to anyone who is not asking me. And given that she is sometimes prone to the same rage our narcissistic mother often unleashed, I definitely do not want to get even close to the ever-piling mistakes that are her choices in life.

Anyhow, I hurt. And I'm not sure why. Writing this helps me realize that a significant part of my chaotic emotions is the fact that I deeply hate people who cheat on their partner. I make sure to distance myself from anyone I know who is willing to commit such cruelty. So my sister is in that group now and that's definitely confusing.

Another reason for my weird emotions is that I'm involuntarily imagining what it would be like to be in her shoes, and jolly hecklers... anxious self-hate barely begins to describe what it must be like.

Well, its 5:30 AM. I don't think I can sleep. Too much turmoil. I'm too close to people I wouldn't normally associate with, if they weren't family. I feel like it is me whose heart has a knife sticking out of it, but the truth is: I have nothing to do with it at all. Not my life. I have my own burdens to wince from.

Not including the one I'm with now I had seen 5 or 6 therapists over the course of a few years and hated all but one of them. They treated me like toddler when I was at *youngest* 16. Even at 19 and 20 I've had it happen. I've also seen 4 psychiatrists, did a group therapy program that met an hour a week and also did an intensive outpatient therapy thing that had group sessions 35hrs a week M-F. I went to a hospital for my suicidal thoughts last summer and was committed for about a week. Terrible experience, they pretty much did nothing but treated me like a dangerous wild animal rather than a person.


I've been on now 4 different antidepressants and an anti-anxiety med. 

My point is I've tried a LOT of things. Nobody can tell me I haven't tried (even though I've still had it said) and just none of it has worked at *all.* I've wasted literally thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours on treating my mental health and literally made no progress whatsoever.

31,"So this whole past year has been absolute crap: 

‚Ä¢my husband and me separated from a pretty  bad and physically abusive relationship, causing me to uproot back up north from VA, with no money as I quit my job to stay at home and take care of everything  (military relationship) but on the positive side, grew a lot from this loss and challenge to stand back up. And from what I hear, he's doing well too, so I'm very happy and still trying to fully let go of the heart ache that seems to linger on/off some days.
‚Ä¢I moved back home and got into a pretty abusive relationship with my ex (I sure can pick them). He was very mentally and emotionally abusive and tore me down to nothing, accusing me of cheating so I lost all of my friends and distanced myself from my gram, I even deleted facebook since he thought people only used it for cheating (he's 16 years older than me, my gram already scolded me for this). But with that, i was really happy that marriage counseling paid off to apply to the fights him and I had. I never called him a name, fought back really at all, and always apologized first. I always made sure to effectively think about what made me sad and communicate it, but usually he would think something was sarcastic or if I made any joke he would be angry saying ""theres always truth to jokes."" But, I tried, that's what I'm trying to focus on for silver lining. May have gone too far to the extreme with push over, but it was growth since I always chose to defend myself and continue the fight than to end it. 
‚Ä¢ I suffered the loss of an unknown pregnancy (first one at that) that resulted in my ex that it was with to self harm and almost lose his life. All the while he was yelling at me throughout the loss even though I was working full time and pushing through the physical agony and the emotional toll I wasn't fully aware I was going through. I had no one the entire time and just forced myself through work.  To be honest, i had no idea what was happening. My chest did grow substantially, my sense of smell was off the walls, and I was ravenous. But I figured it was because my period was due, but then it just.. didnt stop. I even tried believing maybe I drank too much ginger because that could totally be acidic and cause that and all the excruciating pain I felt daily for weeks. 
‚Ä¢ I had to balance 4 college courses this summer all at the same time.  2 classes for six weeks, then another 2 for another 6. The last two classes I just had were english courses I took in 3 hour sessions two times a week. 
‚Ä¢and tomorrow is my late mother's birthday, she passed when I was 15, 8 years ago. But with all the stress lately, a girl could really use her mom sometimes. A familiar coo, or someone to scratch your back till you fall asleep and comfort the only way a mom can. Needless to say it's hard. 

I finally stopped and said alright, this is a trainwreck. 

I took leave from work until this coming Monday. I managed to finally find myself a primary, an OBGYN, and a therapist. I moved out of my abusive exes apartment and back to the comfort and safety of my grams home. I managed to finish my english courses with A's, which was beyond hard. Every other day was an 8 page research paper due for the last 6 weeks with a final 20 page journal on the perceptions of reality and sacred geometry (new england stoner chick who spends too much time alone and my English teacher is a huge hippie) I didn't miss a single assignment, I revised essays and resubmitted them for higher grades, and I'm even going to type up one of my creative writing papers my teacher suggest i should publish! It took me basically 5-8 hours everyday after class since I took a few years off from school and became a huge stoner, so my focus is always a bit off (I mean look at what youre reading) And as soon as my last English final was over, I took off down to Virginia for a getaway for a week and to see old friends I missed, then managed to make it back two days ago, to make it to pride in P-town today!  And I even reached out to my aunt who I had a huge falling out with years ago, and invited her to dinner with my gram (her mom) and me for my moms (her sisters) birthday, she said yes!

I'm so tired. But I grew, I didn't give up on myself for once, I found help, I'm eating again, my grades are higher, im finally rebuilding relationships with my family, and I'm finally feeling happy.

34,"Our son is 26 years old. He was a bright, outgoing, happy child up to the first year in high school. He had good grades and was often in honor role. He had a gradual character change when he was a high school sophomore. From being a happy person, he became introverted, pessimistic and sometimes bad tempered after a failed pursuant of a girl whom he had a crush on. After high school, he got in one of the top 10 State universities and majored in one of the liberal art subjects. When he was in college, he did not make ANY friends. He was quiet, shy and was lack of energy. He was a loner. It seemed that the shadow of the failed romance in high school had never left him. Before he turned 18, we took him to a psychologist. The doctor told us that he had mild depression and social anxiety. He didn't take any medication for it.

It took him 6 long years to complete his BA degree program. He suffered from writer's block that resulted dropping classes and/or took less than full credit in a number of semesters. It was a struggling college experience for him and for us, his parents. We kind of knew he played a lot of video games instead of studying. He finally graduated. Strangely, he graduated with a decent GPA. We met his professors of his major field at his graduation. They all said he was very talented and encouraged him to continue studies in grad school.

By the way, we paid all his tuition and living expenses. He has no student debt. We are by no means rich, just working in professional jobs with very average income. We saved for his college for years and years...

He moved out of our house and is sharing an apartment with some one.

He didn't know what to do after college graduation. He found a job in a supermarket bagging groceries. We stopped paying for his living expenses at that point. He became tired of the job after he worked there for 2 years.

All of sudden, he quit his supermarket job. He told us that he saved enough money to pay for his rent, food and expenses for a year. He said he was taking time off until he runs out of money.

He refused to further his education or to make an effort in finding another job. He spends most of his time hanging out with a high school friend who never went to college nor worked in his entire life. That friend has wealthy parents. We don't understand how the friend's parents would let their child to live a life like that.

Our son is lost. He is wasting away his youth. We can no longer reach out to him and discuss his future with him. He still talks to us sometime, but he always ends the conversation when we want to talk about his future plans.

At 26, he has not had a girlfriend since his very brief romance at age 16. He is not driven for anything in life. He wouldn't even deposit his tax return check (almost 1K) and let the check to expire. He spends most of his time playing video games, staring at his iPhone or watch TV or hangs out with his friend.

He is by no means living a good life that many people of his age do. We can't pursue medical treatment for his possible depression because of his age. We have been feeling painful seeing him getting lost in life.

In a number of conversations with him, he blamed us for his miseries because we were incompetent parents. He is not happy with his current situation, but he does not make an effort to get out of this mess.

So basically, after recently moving into a traditional-style hall and having a roommate, I found it considerably harder to masturbate. I‚Äôm not a fan of doing it in the shower, at all. Into a sock is just nasty and ruins the article of clothing. I do it in the comfort of my own bed.

At this point, I have gone about four to five days or so without masturbating. To some, this length of time is nothing at all. Good for you, going this long for me was irritating as hell. For one, it got considerably harder to take a piss. I would get the absolute urge to pee, then when I‚Äôm standing over the toilet about to take a piss, I somehow magically can‚Äôt, probably because my prostate says ‚Äúfuck you, beat your dick first‚Äù back to me. I don‚Äôt have a UTI btw.

I‚Äôm over in my bed, it‚Äôs around one in the morning, my roommate is asleep, and I whip out my dong and start beating. Right before I release, for some reason, I decided that releasing in my white silk sheet was the best place to do it.

It really wasn‚Äôt. At all.

There was a big ass cumstain the size of an adult raccoon on that motherfucker. I‚Äôm sitting up in my bed, flashlight pointed at my sheet, staring at this stain wondering how the hell I‚Äôm going to get it out.

I couldn‚Äôt wait for it to dry and then wash the sheet, because it would get considerably harder to get the stain out once it‚Äôs dry, and I don‚Äôt want other people at my hall seeing me load a sheet with a big ass cumstain in the washer.

Realizing that the only way I could get the stain out was by washing it out with cold water while it was still wet, I sat in my bed, in despair. There was no way I could use the sink in our floor‚Äôs kitchen because that‚Äôs nasty, and if someone walks in on me doing that, then I‚Äôm fucked. Also, pretty sure the laundry room area was closed as well, since it was considerably late.

Then, it clicked. The 1000 IQ play that would make me avoid confrontation, avoid others seeing the sheet, and thoroughly cleaning the sheet with cold water.

The shower.

With immense focus, I quietly jumped out of my bed as to not wake my slumbering roommate. Then, without haste, I wrapped the sheet in a gargantuan towel, brought a separate bag, and quickly went off to the floor‚Äôs bathroom. I stepped into the shower, put my clothes in the bag, unwrapped the towel, hung both the towel and the bag outside, leaving only me with the sheet. I turned on the cold water, and began to wash out the stain, wringing out the sheet considerably, but as quietly as I could. I heard maybe two or three people walk in and out of the bathroom, and some dangerously close to the shower. However, knowing that nobody would try to peek inside the shower or rip away the curtain, no matter what I was doing, I continued to wash away. Once I finished, I wrapped the sheet in the big towel, put my clothes back on, and went back to my dorm. I put the towel and the sheet in my laundry basket, and hopped back into my bed. Mission accomplished.

While this was greatly NSFW and something that seems like should be in r/thathappened, there is one major takeaway. No matter what dire situation you may put yourself in, you are always capable of doing a big brain play to successfully get yourself out of it.",23Aug2019,1

39,"In the past year, I‚Äôve made a lot of good friends. For a long time I thought I had found my best friend. But then I *actually* found my best friend. The person who makes me the most comfortable, the happiest without ever lifting a finger to try, the coziest and most loved. He makes me feel special, like I‚Äôm the only one who matters to him in the world. There‚Äôs nothing I can‚Äôt tell him. Nothing me and him can‚Äôt do. Even after everything. 

There was a time when I was a mess, within the last year. When I let my fears and anxieties rule me, and they made me everything he hated. He didn‚Äôt want someone like the person I was becoming in his life, and he told me as much. He told me that I had to change, before I lost him. He was right to tell me that. He was right to force me to open my eyes that way. Otherwise I would have lost him and so much more. But I found what I needed to change. To be someone better, for him. There were tears, there was anger and cruel words. There was even a time, for only a few hours, when he left me and I thought I‚Äôd never see him again. For all the things in my life, that few hours broke my heart more completely than it‚Äôs ever been, before or since. I love him, I can never imagine life without him in it anymore. We don‚Äôt even talk as regularly as we used to, but every time we do I see him and my heart goes into a flutter. I always feel happy and cared for with him. The toxicity that nearly broke us apart is just a memory to us now. I don‚Äôt look fondly upon it, but it served to strengthen us in the end. I would be so lonely, so empty and sad, without him. Even the thought of him makes me happy. Writing this is making me tear up. 

I love him. I really do. There‚Äôs nothing about him that I don‚Äôt love. I could be his friend for the rest of my life and never feel alone. I‚Äôd always learn something new about him. There‚Äôs never a time when I feel afraid with him. Not anymore. Me and him have both changed, and we‚Äôve changed in ways that have made up both better people and better friends. I have so many incredible friends, and it‚Äôs so hard to choose sometimes. But among them all, among the smiles and kind words and loving things they do for me, he is and always will be my best friend.",23Aug2019,2
40,"One day while walking to class, I found a Gucci Bag full of Weed, Vapes, and other stuff that I have no idea what is called. Instead of returning it, I kept it till I knew who‚Äôs it was. I told a few good friends and then one of my friends told another good friend of mine. The thing is, someone else heard it and told the person who‚Äôs bag it was that I had it. He added me on Snapchat and we talked and decided to meet in front of the classrooms in the open Quad area. The transaction went fine and he actually told me sorry because he felt bad I had to deal with this. The bad thing was, I let my friend borrow the Weed Juul and he had three ‚Äòhits‚Äô. This guy was mad when he found out and told my friend to pay him 30$ for it. My friend agreed. He does not have the money yet though so he was trying to get the 30$. Today at lunch, some seniors come up to my friend and interrogate him. They‚Äôre dangerous. I might be over exaggerating but they feel super dangerous to me. Like stab you dangerous. They were all up I‚Äôm my friends face about the situation and how he used his Weed Juul and now they‚Äôre threatening to beat my friend up. I am caught in the middle and fear for me and my friends safety. What should I do? Because if I snitch, All of his friends will come after me. If I don‚Äôt we‚Äôll have to deal with seniors always on our backs ready to jump us. I can‚Äôt say on here but one of the seniors is more dangerous then the others.

46,"My life has been going downhill for a couple of years now. At this point i feel like i know what to do but somehow i can‚Äôt do it. 
I started high-school in 2016 and it‚Äôs 2019 i still haven‚Äôt passed it. In the beginning i kept missing classes, everyday i‚Äôd procrastinate and never go to school and i couldn‚Äôt stop. My mother tried allot for me to go back but every-time I would join a new school, I‚Äôd start missing classes again and eventually never went for longer than the first month. In my country,  a person decides their career path by the stream they take in high-school. My mother is a doctor and my father who passed away in 2016 also was. My brother is studying computer science abroad and the entirety of my dads family were either doctors, teachers or engineers. I never knew what I wanted to do in life and always assumed it would have to be something in the sciences since that‚Äôs what my family had done. Anything in the creative field was foreign and not respectable according to them/Couldn‚Äôt provide a decent living. 
Those 3 years in which I kept missing my classes, I had taken PCMB (Physics, chem, bio and math + 2 languages) And i never studied them. I never gave any exams obviously because i never went to school. As a result
i‚Äôd always get called out during family functions and almost all of my moms friends and close friends knew what i wasn‚Äôt doing and basically my whole life story. I was humiliated allot in front of people i never even knew. 
I apologize if everything is out of order but i have so much on my mind i don‚Äôt know how to begin to organize it all. 
I grew up in a very abusive family. My parents hated each other and always always fought, verbal and physical. I never talk about this to anyone and i never thought that my childhood had mental and physical abuse in it. I assumed that‚Äôs what every family was like until my brother who‚Äôs on vacation at the moment mentioned it to my mother last night. My father wasn‚Äôt the problem. My mother is very abusive in all sorts of ways, toxic you‚Äôd say. I‚Äôve tried to tell her my problems with my mental stability and help that i might need academically but somehow the end result of each conversation has always been about her being a bad mother and not bringing me up well instead of me telling her that i want to kill myself because of all the disappointment i radiated. I‚Äôve felt like i would go crazy at some points, that my life had no meaning and all i‚Äôd ever done was to disappoint people around me. Death was the only answer and honestly, i felt people would be glad i was finally, gone. I would sit with a stack of pills before me on my bed thinking i would die that night by overdose. I‚Äôd tell my mother i want to die, i want to kill myself and be told that if i killed myself, she‚Äôd get blamed for it. And not that maybe i shouldn‚Äôt kill myself? I broke down one evening when she asked me if i was okay. I thought she‚Äôd finally understand me. But now i get insulted every time she chooses to speak to me. 
I don‚Äôt do drugs and i don‚Äôt drink alcohol. I‚Äôve never been a bad child in that sense. I dropped out purely because i didn‚Äôt know what i wanted to do in life and i didn‚Äôt know that sciences wasn‚Äôt for me. 
Recently i talked to my brother about creativity. He told me if i chose to do that i‚Äôd honestly be really good at it. I‚Äôve always sketched and drawn since i was little, i‚Äôm not the best but i‚Äôm pretty decent at it. I felt like that was an opening for me. That id finally be able to do what i am good at and not look at my books and be so bored and irritated to even touch them. 
I‚Äôm extremely introverted. But the thought of stepping out of my comfort zone to do something like fashion designing or film or journalism felt good. I was so happy. 
I don‚Äôt know why when some things become clear to me that others just fall apart again. 
I‚Äôm aware of all the mistakes that i‚Äôve made and i hoped my mother would give me a chance to let me explore. To let me be happy once again. But my brother and my mother want me to leave her house in the next two weeks and begin living as a paying guest somewhere while doing a diploma. I don‚Äôt want to do that. They yell at me constantly every single day reminding me of the disappointment that i am.  If i try to stand up for myself i‚Äôm told that i don‚Äôt have a good enough status to talk back to people who are providing me with shelter and food. I get humiliated in front of people. I‚Äôm told not to cry because that just shows that i‚Äôm weak. My brother and mother always manage to add at least one sentence to insult me while talking with me everytime in a day. 
I finally know what i want to do. My friends are happy for me. Why can‚Äôt i live how i want to live? I always stopped myself from suicide cause i cried it out and believed that things would be better someday. I stopped self harm after 14 because i became a coward. I stopped telling anybody anything because i never expected them to understand. I took therapy 3 times but nothing ever helped me more than my own consolation that things would be okay someday. I found hope in my friends and lived for the present more than the future. I‚Äôm so flawed and honestly i accept that i‚Äôm a disappointment. But i finally know what i want. And i don‚Äôt know how to get my mother to understand me. I don‚Äôt know how to stop being humiliated in public. I don‚Äôt know how to stand up for myself without being belittled. I want to stop hearing all the negative things about me. I need help.",23Aug2019,2
47,"My parents are away and I (19) am home alone with just my two dogs. In the middle of the day, this truck I‚Äôve never seen before pulls up into the gravel driveway parallel to our house. There were two people inside the truck: a woman, who kept coughing up spit (ew) looking grossly disheveled, and an equally frightening man, with unkempt hair, dirty clothes, and an overall unsettling demeanor. His wife, I presume, was coughing loudly as the truck idled and the man walked towards my house. I was terrified as he knocked on my door and rang the doorbell. Luckily, I locked the deadbolt earlier, just because I‚Äôm so paranoid when I‚Äôm by myself. My dogs barked and I was panicked that they were gonna break in, but keep in mind this is the middle of the day. Eventually, the couple left.
And now it‚Äôs 1:30 AM, the next day, and I‚Äôm still home alone. I heard a car pull into the rocks again - which none of my neighbors use, as it‚Äôs our property. I‚Äôm scared that it‚Äôs them. Maybe they were here earlier to ‚Äúscope out‚Äù my house to check if it was empty.",23Aug2019,1
48,"I started this job a year ago because it was ''the safe choice'' but this job was so boring, It made me lazy in general. 90% of the time I was here I had nothing to do but still had to be present. thereby i couldn't even have a vacation this year... (Yes i had days off, but i only could take them when someone could fill for me and since I was the only Full-time worker here, I only could take a day off on days I didn't need to be free)  
I've been thinking about quitting for such a long time and today I finally did it.

I know it might be stupid since I haven't found another job. But I couldn't stay here any longer, this job made me dead inside. I still live at home and have a nice saving. So i'm not worried.

It's at that exact moment I imagine that same child to grow up and commit suicide years down the line or to grow a resentment towards his parents; knowing the once happy family is sat upset, grieving or in misery; I feel at ease with it all. 

If I see a video of a person being assaulted on a recorded video while on-lookers laugh and egg on the assault, I wish inside the victim would land a punch killing the person instantly.

60,"So this is going to be a long post and I‚Äôm still not quite sure why I‚Äôm writing it. Advice? Perspective? I‚Äôm unsure. 

My life has been very eventful, something I kind of picked up on when I was around 6.
I grew up in the U.K, with an Asian father, Italian-British mother and my two younger siblings (there are now 5 of us in total but I‚Äôll get to that later). Dad was very religious, but didn‚Äôt really follow it so much himself as he did dictate to the rest of the family. Growing up, as is usual with Asian families, we lived with my fathers mother and sisters. I was bullied at school because other children thought it was weird we all lived together, and because I was the only Asian person in the school. (We lived in rural Wales).  
Mum and dad owned businesses and were away for most of the childhood. We had lots of money, horses and nice houses but never really got to enjoy them. My childhood was spent eating and watching TV, waiting for them to come home. I never learnt how to ride a bike. We never had routine, breakfast, bedtimes etc. Dad was wealthy, but involved with dodgy people. From the age of 6 he would leave me with my 4yo and 1yo sister. I don‚Äôt know what he used to do. I suspect drugs. I remember finding a carrier bag full of white powder on the windowsill in one of his flats once. Dad was an alcoholic and extremely abusive to mum. I remember waking up on Christmas Eve, I was probably around 5, and mum was sat crying and covered in bruises under the Christmas tree in her knickers. 

Another time I woke up to shouting at 3am, dad had tried to punch mum and missed. He ended up punching through the door instead, missing an artery by a couple of cm‚Äôs apparently, leaving blood all over the floor and wall. Me and my sister were so scared of him we would piss in our room instead of going to the toilet for fear of him shouting at us. I realise now how strange that is. Things like this happened regularly dating back to before I was even born. When she was pregnant with me, he beat her up and left her in a ditch. I don‚Äôt know why my mother told me these things as looking back now I realise I was very young. She was also probably extremely lonely and felt she could tell me as I was the eldest. When my mother was pregnant with my youngest sister, my father left for 4 months and shacked up with another woman in Pakistan. Mum held down the fort and was working in their businesses the day after giving birth. Dad came home 2 weeks after the birth. And so we continued. 

He drank every day. 2 bottles of wine, 8 cans of 7% Kestrel Super beer. The smell of beer still makes me heave now. Then, when I was around 7, mum picked us up from school one day and took us an hour away to a random house . It was a domestic violence women‚Äôs refuge. Mum drove us back and forth to our old school for around 4 months, until dad turned up at the school. Then we went to one near the women‚Äôs refuge and ended up staying another 8 months. One day mum picked us up from school and took us to our real home and there we were, back with dad. The abuse went on for another 3 years. Mum was cheating on dad with one of the guys who worked in their shops. I was 10 at this point and knew what was going on. I don‚Äôt blame her. She was 30 with 3 kids and had lost 15 years of her life at this point. My heart always broke for her, even back then. One night my dad, drunk as usual, lost his temper, as usual. He ended up strangling my then 3yo sister until she almost died. Then he slapped us all and roughed us up, ripping our clothes. He shoved us in a room and we sat there for 4 hours. Mum eventually turned up. I will never forget the way she looked at us. I heard her saying to my father that we would meet him back at our house (we had been in one of his flats above a shop at this point). We never went home. 

We ended up staying with one of mums friends, who she had met working in one of my dads shops. This friend lived across the road from the shop. For 3 weeks we ducked our heads every time we went out in the car, and kept the curtains shut in case he saw us when we visited the shop. We felt like fugitives. We then went to live with my mothers mum. This woman is a whole other story. I love her but we don‚Äôt speak anymore and she is a huge narc. She once poisoned her husband to the point that doctors thought he had Alzheimer‚Äôs and diagnosed him. You couldn‚Äôt make it up, honestly. So we live on my grandmas living room floor for 2 years. Mum left with ¬£100 and the clothes we had on our backs. So that was a pretty tough time but more for my mum. I really can‚Äôt imagine how she must have felt. 

My younger sisters see dad sometimes, on and off over 3 years. I never go. I think I remember too much and they remember too little. I love him but I am so scared of him. Mum meets this really nice guy (they‚Äôre still together 11 years later and have blessed me with two more beautiful siblings). Fast forward a few years, we move 50 miles away to another school half way through GCSE year. I start smoking weed heavily but I do make friends and school is going well, everything‚Äôs fine until I get pregnant at 15. I got rid of it. Had some depression for a while. I think out of guilt. Went to visit family and reconnected with dad. He just turned up. But I didn‚Äôt mind. We have a good time and make our peace and text a few times after this until it fizzles out. I lose his number and he moves house. I wrote a letter to the house but never got a response.

 I leave school with pretty good grades and get an amazing job at 16 and end up with an angel investor and my own company in central London at 18. At the same time I meet a guy, whom I end up spending the next 3.5 years with. He was exactly like my dad. The abuse started 3 months in. He spit, kicked, bit, punched, cheated and did everything you can possibly think of doing. He once choked me with a McDonald‚Äôs cup. It sounds more comical than it is. I have a hole in my foot and a dent/bald patch above my ear from where he threw glass at me. He took everything I earned for 3 years. Terrorised me at work. I lost all jobs but one, and my company due to him. Despite all this, it was more psychologically draining than anything else. We‚Äôre towards the end of the relationship now and a week before my 21st birthday, I‚Äôm sat in my room. Mum calls down. My dad has died. I call my ex (still bf at this point). He turns up and I tell him. He asks to borrow ¬£10 for fuel and that he‚Äôll come back to pick me up and we‚Äôll go for chat and joint. He didn‚Äôt come back that day. He went to the pub.

This was 2 years ago in May. Honestly, you would think I‚Äôd be happy or relieved about my dad. but it devastated me. I can take banter and you would never think I‚Äôm anything but care-free and light hearted, but I am so sensitive and so full of love, and it truly fucking shattered me. So we get this call on the Tuesday that he‚Äôs died. Blood clot. Possibly linked to alcoholism. He also has cirrhosis of the liver. He was 45. We bury him on Friday. It was an open casket. I remember thinking I could see him moving. I expected him to just jump up. But he didn‚Äôt. Whilst I‚Äôm at the funeral in the room with the casket, my ex is texting me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your fault your dad died‚Äù, ‚ÄúGo and die with your dead Paki dad‚Äù etc. The day after his funeral I went home and end the relationship. Fast forward to now 2 years later. I‚Äôm the executor of dads estate which was worth 1.6mil when he died. It‚Äôs very desensitising to speak about the fact your dad is dead every day. But it has helped me come to terms with the fact he‚Äôs gone. I have my own company now and we have earned v good money this year, but haven‚Äôt actually been paid it yet. I spent the past two years shagging around trying to regain some sense of wholeness, and making up for the 3.5 years I lost with ex. I‚Äôm not depressed but I am very anxious and v sad. I feel like my life has been rather sad. And my anxiety centres around death and time. I constantly think about my family dying, or me dying. I‚Äôm very conscious of time and how quickly it moves. I‚Äôm petrified of getting older, I feel sick at how much time I‚Äôve lost. My whole life is a blur aside from the points I‚Äôve mentioned. But I am very appreciative of it. I love my family and friends and people in general so much. I just feel pretty traumatised I guess.

You would never think any of this if you met me. I‚Äôm fairly popular, I‚Äôm ok looking and I‚Äôm known for being a laugh and going out all the time. I am also extremely erratic, fickle, find it hard to have meaningful relationships. Diagnosed with ADHD last year which made life make more sense for me. 

Don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm looking for and don‚Äôt expect anyone to read this. Sorry for the awful flow, I‚Äôm an A* English student but I am also high.

62,"Me and a buddy of mine just got off work, we have a group of people we meet up with, well our group of friends today met up at the beginning of the cross walk, and sit in their car. Me and my buddy parked across the street so we started crossing the street. I looked both directions and literally didn‚Äôt see a single car anywhere. As we started to get close to the end of the cross walk I feel a gust of wind, here tires squealing a tiny bit, and just see a car swerving super quickly as it passed by. It must‚Äôve been going 80 or 90mph if it got where it got that fast, but I also think maybe they just had their lights off and I didn‚Äôt see them (I work the night shift). We reach the end and we get in my buddy‚Äôs car. I really thought to myself. I could literally not be sitting here right now. I wouldn‚Äôt of ever guessed that could‚Äôve just been my last day here.

65,"Hi everybody. I am a 21 year old male and currently work as a CNA at a hospital. I work nightshift and I hate it. Work is boring because all I do is change baby diapers (I work children's hospital)  and take blood pressures. I don't have many friends at work because they're mostly older women and pretty un-relatable. Now the only good thing about my job is that I make okay money (about 1600 to 1800) a month which is better than retail where I live. Now I have been working towards a nursing degree because it was something I randomly chose and have been trying to stick with it and forcing myself to do because I haven't found anything else.

So now that you know a little bit about my situation, this is what's going on in my head. I want to quit my job and dropout of college so I can find a job where I can support myself to move out of my parents house and really figure out what I want to do. At this point in my life I have figured out that we all can't find the thing we're most passionate about and do it for the rest of our lives. I just need help finding something that's tolerable. I am money motivated so finding a career or degree that can support the lifestyle I want to live is important to me. I just don't know where to start. Has anybody else been in my situation? Should I start seeing a career counselor? What are higher paying jobs that I can look into even though I don't have a degree.",23Aug2019,1
66,"A little backstory. About a year ago, my mother died and my step father put me out of the house. He said i can either go into foster care or live with my grandmother. 

He dropped me off on her doorstep, and she was ok at first but quickly turned sour. She told me that she doesn't want me and that i'm lucky that she took me in. She always makes it very clear that i'm not welcome. She's told me to go out and buy my own food when there was a whole full fridge, and I was 15 and broke.

When I first moved in, it was July and very hot. She told me I always had to close my bedroom door so that the AC didnt go into my room, and the rest of the house would have more. Take note that our house is very old and does not have central air conditioning or heating. It's like a hot car in the summer. We have one window AC units that's supposed to cool down the whole house. I was and still am miserable. I dont feel like i have a home, and until i'm 18 i'm stuck here.

67,"Hey, just some information about me I'm a 16 year old male and recently I've been experiencing alot of stress that is probably taking a toll on my mental health. 
For some background info few years back my brother left for mandatory military training that every national of my country has to attend (If their GPA is high then they have a choice to skip) my brother leaving for the training (9 months) took it's toll on every one of my household family members and caused some drama, some examples of this are fights between my sisters and mother, with alot of shouting, my mother having seizures more often from stress, and my Grandfather getting sick, and other family issues fights etc. that caused me a bit of trauma and sometimes any noise that sounds like screaming makes me think it is a family member, thankfully this dissapeared for a long time but returned few months back, events that triggered this include, my sister having a heart attack and I was the only one at home to help (she is okay now) my mother suddenly collapses from a siezure after years of that not happening, my uncle which my mother trusts dearly starts yelling at my mother to the point that she broke down crying hysterically when she returned home, my sister yelling as if she is getting murdered but turns out it was just her and my other sister playing around, few weeks back my sister kept breaking down crying every once in a while, and yesterday I heard my sister cry alot in her room, her door is locked and I heard multiple things fall and the crying stop, that fucked me up bad, and now 8 in the morning today I woke up to what I thought was crying and I assumed the worst, since at this point my grandpa was in a grave condition and I thought something happened to him, I stayed 10 minutes in my bed scared to face what might have happened and when i finally manned up and checked what was happening turned out it what was crying (to me) was a regular conversation between my sisters.

Manipulated me because I was so attached, laughed at my face, took me like Im an ignorant, like I dont know nothing about life, she thought she knew me without even meeting me in person, she honestly think Im a bad guy because I stopped taking bullshit and started telling her.

78,"I have liked this girl for a while now and I was too much of coward to say anything to her but today I decided to finally man up and ask her out.

There were actually two parts to this story:

So first we were at the bus stop waiting for the bus to come which was in 20 mins so to fill in the time we decided to play ispy. We were playing for a while and I was wondering when should I tell how I feel? So when it was my turn I said: ""i spy with my little eye someone that likes you."" It kind of got quiet and she pointed at some random dude and jokingly asked if it was him but I joked and asked if she wanted me to ask him. But then she pointed at me and said that she just got out of a relationship a month ago and wasn't sure about dating again so I said oh that's fine. She asked me how long I liked her and I told her I didn't want to talk about it and we continued to act as nothing happened throughout the bus ride too. 

Once we got to my stop I got off and all I said was I'll see ya later and walked to my car parking spot, got in, threw my stuff in and turned on the car. But then I realized that I didn't say anything much so I turned off my car and ran back to the bus and sat next to her. I told everything on my mind and said that I was too much of a coward to say anything earlier and that I respect that she is worried about being in another relationship so after I told her how I really felt I walked back out of the bus and walked halfway to my car when I realized I didn't even ask her out. So then I ran back to the bus and hopped in again, and she was smiling/laughing and I told her that I'm not like the other guys and I would never do anything terrible to her. I asked her when she was free and asked her out to dinner and she said yes.

Bottom line is that I feel so much better now with closure and IDK how I got that much confidence suddenly but I just felt like sharing this with you all.",23Aug2019,1

80,"Last night was a great night, I watched Once Upon A Time In Hollywood for the 3rd time, hung out with my old college room mates for a while then met my girlfriend and her friends for sushi. It was a great way for me to wind down after the stressful few weeks I‚Äôve been having. 

We left the sushi place around 11 and I saw police and fire fighter lights, which isn‚Äôt super uncommon. I don‚Äôt live in a high crime area so usually I see the two together dealing with car wrecks, older people with health problems, etc. I started down the road to get home and they had all 4 lanes of this side of the road closed with at least 2 full size fire trucks, 4-5 squad cars and an ambulance. Of course I was like ‚Äúwhat the fuck is going on‚Äù so I approach slowly as it looks like it just happened and they hadn‚Äôt figured out how to deal with the small about of traffic coming up. They waved us to drive through the parking lot of a business nearby. 

When I was leaving the parking lot I saw it. Not even the entire body but just the legs, but I knew that person had died. You know how sometimes you just know things? I just knew. As I began to turn 4 fire fighters grabbed a sheet from their truck and covered the body. I went home and looked at the news outlets to see if anyone was covering it yet and the only thing I could find was that a pedestrian had been hit by a car.

I checked again later and it had a bit more detail. The driver (it said he was driving a ‚Äúpassenger vehicle‚Äù so I assume uber maybe? Not sure what that means entirely) thought they hit an animal and kept going to the apartment complex next to the intersection and didn‚Äôt return until they saw the lights from the fire truck. Why wouldn‚Äôt you stop if you thought you hit something? Especially at night, on a not well lit road going 50+ mph. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you thought it was a dog, deer or giraffe why wouldn‚Äôt you stop to check?

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen a dead body before. At least not in public like that, maybe at a funeral, of course on the Internet. I grew up seeing some pretty gruesome shit on websites I shouldn‚Äôt have been on, but I think this is one of the first instances I really felt desensitized to it. A person just lost their life and I couldn‚Äôt think of anything other than ‚ÄúDamn.‚Äù I went home and my girlfriend called her family that lives in the area to make sure they were okay, I didn‚Äôt even think to call mine. Am I a shitty person for that? I don‚Äôt have a lot of family that would‚Äôve been out and about at the time but I don‚Äôt think I even thought of that. I don‚Äôt think I thought of anything.

Today I‚Äôve been trying to think about it more and understand what I saw and how to process it. I found out it was a woman who was killed, I wonder who she was? What was she doing out that night? Maybe walking her dog? Where‚Äôs her dog at now? What did her coworkers think this morning when she didn‚Äôt show up to the office? How‚Äôs her mom doing? I still don‚Äôt really know if that‚Äôs helping me process it but I feel better acknowledging that she was a person and alive.

Are we as humans meant to process death? I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm not scared or anything, I just think of it as a void in our ability to understand things. Of course we can look at it scientifically but where do the memories go? Where does the consciousness go? Maybe nowhere, maybe heaven, maybe purgatory, maybe it just ceases to exist? I don‚Äôt know, but experiencing that last night has made me think a lot about how much uncertainty there is in our world. 

That woman could‚Äôve been the healthiest and fittest person on this earth, and maybe she lived that lifestyle bc she wanted to live a long time, but all of that dedication didn‚Äôt mean anything when she was hit by a car. Maybe she was a heroin addict who was killed by a car before the drugs did it to her. I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs all uncertain and fluid, I don‚Äôt know what it means. It doesn‚Äôt creep me out or scare me but it‚Äôs just crazy to think about.",23Aug2019,13

She is from a higher social class than I do so we have a lot of disagreements about everything. I have gone through shits myself so I am more mature than her and really extrovert while she is an extreme case of introvert. I am also her first relationship so I am totally sympathise on her lack of some understanding in relationship. However, we have been arguing so much that I am really stressful every we meet, like I will fully know we will argue about something extremely random but it is always her starting. E.g: She keep checking my phone even though I don‚Äôt want to, she‚Äôll accuse me of hiding stuffs from her if I don‚Äôt give it, most recent one (yesterday) is she coming to my work but I was super busy so could not check the phone, she turned passive aggressive toward me and said I don‚Äôt care about her
Like I absolutely love her, she is not a bad person, but she is really childish and mildly toxic all the time. Our friends tried to change her mind alot but nothing has worked at all.

88,"Hi everyone I‚Äôm in such an incredible mood today. I‚Äôve been with the most incredible guy for the last six years except where we broke up for a couple months, I‚Äôll get to that. We met my senior/his junior year of college and have been together ever since. I love this man with all my heart and every moment with him I‚Äôm so grateful for. He just brings me so much joy, our times together are fun and jovial. He‚Äôs a great friend, caring compassionate and nice. 

Last year he was going through a rough patch. He was stressed about so much things and he couldn‚Äôt deal with it. He‚Äôs a cop but he‚Äôs also in the Air National Guard and a volunteer firefighter. And last year everything was becoming to much, the cop thing wasn‚Äôt really more than usual but one of his supervisors on the base would be a pain to him and there was a lot of drama going on in the fire department. To top it off, he went to a fire where a victim died inside and no one was able to go in because he probably was already dead when they got there, literally the next day he went to an incident where a kid fell off a cliff and was bleeding a lot and two weeks later there was a motor cycle accident and the cyclist fell off and was bleeding a lot. 

He honestly wasn‚Äôt prepared for this because his police department is a small sub urban town with nothing major and his fire department doesn‚Äôt do EMS so the majority of calls are fire alarms. So that all built up for him and he just wasn‚Äôt doing well. He started drinking a lot as in I had to call in sick for him because he was drunk. It was hard to watch because before hand he never drank, like he has never been into a bar and we have no alcohol in our apartment. He would make bad financial decisions and he wasn‚Äôt in a good place mentally. He refused to get help no matter how hard I tried and I didn‚Äôt know what to do. 

Then out of nowhere he proposed to me with a ring I know he couldn‚Äôt afford. It was the hardest moment of my life considering it‚Äôs what I always wanted from him but I said no. I couldn‚Äôt get married to a man who was like this and didn‚Äôt wanna get help because I didn‚Äôt know where things would go and I wanted to use it as a motivator for him to get help. He stormed out, and showed up drunk the next morning breaking up with me. I was so heart broken, I loved this man but I couldn‚Äôt be with who he has become and I knew he could become who he was again and he declined it. I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was a permanent thing or the alcohol talking. But he came and took his things the next day and didn‚Äôt speak to me for three months. It was hurtful and honestly I fell into some depression during that time. But out of nowhere one day he came back apologized and said he wanted to work on things. 

I immediate said yes with some stipulations. We worked hard on it, we saw a therapist together we made a plan for our life. He eventually got a job a job doing some hazmat stuff and he loves it, he didn‚Äôt resign with the guard and things are much better in the fire department. Like we have been so much happier together the last couple months and I couldn‚Äôt be more thankful. I didn‚Äôt get the man back that I lost but an even better version. 

Yesterday we went hiking and on the summit he gave the most adorable speech and then popped the question. I honestly said yes before he even got on his knee. It was a ring much more affordable and I have been crying ever since I never thought I had been happy. And I thought I would share with you since the people I wanna tell the most, (mom and sister) are away and have crappy service.",23Aug2019,1

97,"I find it very difficult to elaborate this post. In any case, I think it's a good way to start by warning that I have needed the help of Google Translate to create this post. Perhaps this is why you notice that certain phrases are meaningless.

I have come to Reddit to tell my problem with sports betting. **I am a 23 year old young man, Spanish and I am a ludopath** who has been diagnosed since 2016 (when I was 20 years old).

*((The gambling is a pathology that consists in the progressive alteration of the behavior by which the individual experiences an uncontrollable need to play, over any negative consequence. That is why I ask for respect in this post. No one chooses to be a gambler, nor does anyone choose to be diabetic. It is a dramatic disease with a suicide rate six times higher than that of the normal population. In fact, 90% of pathological players present suicidal ideas. All these data have been extracted from studies of the ‚ÄúUniversity of Barcelona‚Äù.))*

When I was 16, I already knew what sports betting was. I saw my brother talk about betting with his friends. The ads began to appear on television and radio. It seemed like an easy and fun way to earn some euros for my savings. As a good student, I had hardly any money and my parents always educated me from austerity.

I was barely 17 years old when I started betting with friends in physical establishments where they didn't ask for any kind of identity document and this behavior was sustained over time until I turned 18. I opened an online account and kept betting almost daily. When I wanted to ask myself if I had a problem it was already too late: I denied it and continued.

When I turned 20, **my addiction to sports betting was so developed that I got to steal my father** a total of ‚Ç¨ 200,000 progressively. From less to more. At the beginning it was ‚Ç¨ 500 and it ended up being ‚Ç¨ 25,000. My father realized those movements a day before he died. He was admitted for severe anemia for a week. I took advantage of that week to steal large amounts that I hoped I could return before he was discharged, pick up the mail from the mailbox and act as if nothing had happened. However, I lost everything I had taken in a few days and ended up realizing. He phoned me very disappointed. He didn't understand why I had done all that. I hid my obsessive behavior from my family so that they would not interfere and therefore my father could not imagine that this money was now in the hands of the big bookmakers. That night he lay down and died sleeping.

I want to emphasize, as I clarify in the ‚Äòspoiler‚Äô, **that this disease makes you not aware of the seriousness of your actions**. Although afterwards I broke down to cry, at that moment I could only think about the game. Maybe I was getting rid of the consequences of having been taking money from my father without his consent.

However, my father called my uncles that night and told them what had happened. After the funeral, my uncles gathered me and demanded explanations. There I burst into tears and told them my problem. They never forgiven me. However, my mother supported me and looked for me a psychologist who has helped me a lot.

However, a key event came throughout this process. Since my parents were divorced, I was the owner of my father's inheritance at 50% with my brother. My brother, closest to my father's family, also rejected me when I confessed what happened. I entered through the inheritance a little more than ‚Ç¨ 1,200,000 plus shares in family businesses worth more than ‚Ç¨ 500,000. I invented that this money had been invested in different investment funds and projects to save me the questions of my mother and my psychologist. **Two years later I lost everything**.

I became a 23-year-old who, without finishing college, had lost all his savings and his father's in sports betting.

I hope everything stays there. Hopefully.

However, when I still had my father's money, I had very good streaks that I used to make myself known among my friends. Two acquaintances offered me ‚Ç¨ 200,000 to bet them. I gave them 75% and I had 25% of the benefits. I saw it as a good financing opportunity since I knew that my father's money was running out. And it is over. All the money is over.

Without my money. Without my father's money and without the money of those ""investors.""

For fear of reprisals I promised them that I would return the money, so they took me to a notary to sign a ‚Äúdebt recognition‚Äù where I accepted that I was indebted to them for a value of ‚Ç¨ 200,000 and that the payment should be made by this month of August.

Not only did he no longer have money, but he had also recognized ‚Ç¨ 200,000 more. I could'nt believe it.

As ""I had nothing to lose"" I went to the bank and asked for a loan of ‚Ç¨ 12,000 that I lost on the same day they granted it to me.

With only ‚Ç¨ 625 in the bank I decided to buy a lethal dose of Nembutal to end my life in the event that this is not resolved soon. At least that would stop hurting those who love me. I don't have high expectations. Realistically, I can hardly understand how someone with my profile could be able to have a happy life with this kind of background. I have mortgaged my life. And that of those who love me.

As a result, I have been writing to the CEO‚Äôs of the bookmakers throughout the month of July and August requesting a refund. Or at least a partial refund of the losses I had with them. I feel you took advantage of me. There are bookmakers like WilliamHill or Marathonbet where they didn't even ask me about my income because I kept getting money and losing it.

The only answer I had was that of Marathonbet. CEO Natalia Zavodnik relegated to her legal team and ended up threatening me by certified mail from her lawyers.

I always spoke from respect and dejection.

Sharing my problem with you is liberating. **Of course everything has been much more complex and long**. However, it was not my intention to bore them. I will answer questions you may have loved. I hope to be much longer with you.

I don't think it makes sense to ban sports betting. The condition that I suffer is only suffered by a large minority of the population. But you have to warn of its risks. Like everything. I entered this world since innocence. Like any young man. Now I'm stuck for life. **Please be aware**.",23Aug2019,3
98,"What's the point of living in this world? I've been asking myself that question a lot lately. I'm 17 and at this point I've given up most of my hope that there is a point. 

Everywhere I look all I see is suffering, on the news, on social media, my own life, my friends lives and it makes me sick. I wish I was still a kid who didn't know better, I used to think the world was perfect, but then I learned it's all garbage. The whole thing is run by money and whoever has the most gets what they want while the rest of us just hang by a thread soaking up what little happiness we can afford while they have it easy. 

Then there's the politicians who only care about their own interests and get the support of the people through manipulation and false promises. It's all weighted against the common people and we can do nothing but scream for change only for it to fall upon deaf ears. 

I hate society. Anything that doesn't fit with the accepted norms is outcast. Some for good reason, but the majority of outcasts simply want to pursue something they love that society deems wrong even though it doesn't hurt anyone. They'll just hate whatever they're told to hate and mindlessly subscribe to whatever they're told because they are the majority.

I hate the prospect of adulthood. Having to constantly work for your right to live until eventually you die anyway. Having to hide your emotions and carry on through the hardships of modern life by yourself. 

I can't take this fucking planet anymore. I'll probably be dead in a couple years if it keeps getting worse, it's better than living through a full lifetimes worth of torment. I'll just watch the world burn in my room alone, forever.",23Aug2019,7

103,"Tomorrow will be a year since we ended any sort of relationship we had. I usually say that ‚ÄúI‚Äù broke up with you, but I do not think that‚Äôs quite fair. It was both of our decision; I was just the one to let the hammer drop first. I still think about you often, so often I think that other people would think that it‚Äôs a problem. I am not sad about it though. We were just so young, and we still are young. The thought of making lifelong commitments and decisions at this age just sounds completely useless almost. I speak for myself in saying that I am not set in any sort of ways. I am constantly changing my mind. Growing, evolving, and also taking many steps back and failing. I can hardly commit to myself, let alone another person. 

I do long for you though. I long for your familiarity, your jokes, your openness. You could be so sweet and kind. I miss you bringing home flowers and wrestling in our bed together in the mornings.

I do not miss feeling like an attachment of you. I don‚Äôt miss craving you everyday and not being able to satisfy that craving with anything healthy. I don‚Äôt miss feeling afraid of you. I don‚Äôt miss the judgment you had for me, and the control you tried to exert over me. I don‚Äôt miss hurting you because I was hurting because I didn‚Äôt know how to deal with it. That‚Äôs probably the biggest one.

*I don‚Äôt miss hurting you because I was hurting.*

I have learned so much. I have done so much self reflection. I have pushed myself much further than I thought I could go, and much further than I would have gone with you in my life. Getting over you was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do in my life. I cannot believe how sad I was. I can‚Äôt believe how empty and helpless and hopeless I felt. A part of me craves that feeling though. That cold blanket of sadness that just wraps you up and lulls you right into submission. Maybe feeling those feelings again would bring back feeling closer to you, because I have never felt further away from you than I do now. We have known each other for 14 years, and spent half of those years connected intimately on an emotional and physical level, and one of those years completely estranged from each other.

It was like you died and I was mourning you, but I would see you in the streets with another girl and it would never lay itself to rest. I was devastated, and it felt like at my own hand a little bit. I chose this. I chose it all. You were at my mercy and I wrecked you.

I can‚Äôt believe all of the horrible things I put you through. I cheated on you. I screamed at you. I called you terrible names. I demeaned you. I made you cry. I did spiteful, hateful things to you and I am sorry for every single one of them. I have tried to learn to manage my anger, and say what I am feeling. I am trying to learn techniques to help myself be a better partner, and person in general. I am learning what I need in order to be the best I can. I am striving so hard to be the best I can, not even for another person, but for myself.

108,"So its Friday afternoon and I find myself (M25) sitting on a park bench on my own once again, basking in the sun with some cold beers and a little bit of weed. 
After another day of futile efforts to make plans with anyone, I just gave up.
Im tired of being alone all the time.
I've tried going out by myself and talking to some randoms trying to make a connection or whatever, some form of human contact, without it being through my computer screen at home or through our tiny pocket computers. I'm actually craving positive contact with people so much. Having a laugh, drinking some beer &amp; smoking some weed, preferrably with someone who is actually excited to hang out with me.

All I see around me is groups of people socialising and having fun, and I'm sitting here writing up this post complaining about how shitty it is to feel this way, and I hate it. What a waste of such a beautiful day, and what a waste of my mental state today, it started off so well.

Wtf do i do yo change this? It's been like this for most of the summer this year (it's been a reaccuring thing my whole life) and it's so fucking boring not having in-depth conversations about stuff with anyone other than my therapist.

I've been doing things by myself the past months (because I hate sitting in my room all day watching some boring-ass streamer or YouTube channel, or browsing reddit on my phone until my finger cramps up and my eyes start drying out, all whilst the sun is shining through my half opened blinders) but it's so fucking boring sitting in the sun/swimming in a lake by yourself, not talking to anyone.

I fucking hate feeling this way, I'm a social, quite a good looking young guy with a lot of potential in life. I've just been dealt terrible cards life wise, so I've got a lot of baggage, which spills out sometimes, even when I don't notice it. And lately I've been working through a lot of shit, trying to keep making the right choices whenever situations ask for them, keeping true to myself and what I believe is the right thing.

 I've been ignored/ghosted/not invited/talked bad about or whatever too many times to not be fed up with it. Had to vent it somewhere, as no one I talk to seems to care.

I could elaborate more on certain subjects to give a better perspective/point of view and help understand why I've come to these conclusions, but that will be another few pages of writing and I don't really feel like typing more.

Thanks for reading my rant, I'm just so tired of feeling this way.

113,"""My best friend dumped the literal psychotic junkie that she met in the psych ward""

I said this to my ex husband (mutual friend) today and instead of cheering he just sighed and braced himself for the rest:

""Introducing next  contestant: 52 y.o., 3 children from 3 different women, he is going through a rough time because he is in the middle of a legal battle for his 3 month old baby""

To which my ex asked is there was some sort of Tinder for losers featuring a million horrible men and my best friend.

My best friend is gorgeous. Model-like, even.  But she is also witty, creative, fun and a million other things that most people don't see. She is beautiful, and that goes so much further than her looks. But she has horrible self esteem and she keeps getting in relationships with fucking creeps because she thinks she doesn't deserve more.

The title? I've told her a million times, my ex has told her a million times, our friends have told her a million times but she still won't believe it. 

So.. I'm telling you. You are beautiful. Maybe physically and you don't know it, maybe your brain is beautiful, maybe you can draw, or dance, or speak different languages or tell me a million little facts that I didn't know before, or maybe you can sing or analyze Neon Genesis Evangelion for hours at a time. Or maybe you always smile at cashiers and tip well in restaurants. I know you have something that makes you beautiful. I know you have something that makes you worthy.

Ans yes, that goes also for you, nerdy guy that reads this from inside your shell of shyness and isolation. You wouldn't believe it from looking at me, but I have dated you before and I still date the grownup version of you. You. Are. Beautiful, Your interests, your passion, makes you beautiful, Get out there!

You are beautiful and you deserve more than a horrible relationship or a life of loneliness, Be you. Learn to be happy with you, and if you are not, build a version of you that makes you happy. You are human, with all our defects and failings and bumps along the way. And human beings are complex and multifaceted and resilient and fucking beautiful. 

Yes, even the fucking creeps. The beauty of being human is we have unlimited potential for improvement. Even the psychotic junkie, and the 52 y.o. hooking up with a girl 20 years his junior. 

So don't settle for some shit life, relationship, job. If you don't have it, you can improve yourself: I guarantee it! I was depressed and obese 6 years ago, now I am very much neither. Go fucking get it, because you have a fire burning inside, a reserve of energy that you don't know you have. Go make the best of yourself and find happiness. Because you are human, and humans are awesome at changing themselves. We are majestic beasts made of supple clay.

So go get what you deserve. And if you don't deserve shit, go get better and get what you deserve.

The kids are kept in a cold concrete cell. 7 have [already died](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/why-are-migrant-children-dying-u-s-custody-n1010316?fbclid=IwAR38n79Vu1jBLejqEPL8NCeCJ7qaGinN2TJOuTfEkVI1BKJDyISX3Jee7Rs) in the past year from sickness. Can you imagine any child you know, in these kinds of cruel conditions?

No matter your opinion on illegal immigration (which these people technically aren't doing, they are presenting themselves at the border and requesting asylum, which is 100% legal), kids shouldn't be punished for their parents' actions. 

It's very disturbing that Trump wants to do this. 

I found [this](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/progressivesecularhumanist/2019/02/report-missing-migrant-children-being-funneled-through-christian-adoption-agency/) article that says that migrant children are being funneled through a Christian adoption agencies with ties to Betsy DeVos. It reminds me of when Native American children would be taken from their families and forced to attend assimilation schools. It reminds me of the dictatorship in Argentina that would ""disappear"" political dissidents and give their children away to families who supported the dictator. 

I just want to go on the record somewhere, to say this is wrong. It's so depressing, I don't want to bring it up in conversation or post it on Facebook so I'm posting it here. How the fuck is this shit happening. All I have to give is my outrage. Why don't people know better?

People who tout illegal-immigrants as criminals don't seem to realize that companies knowingly recruit immigrants from Mexico to work for them ""under the table"", and receive [no penalty](https://time.com/5649108/mississippi-ice-raids-no-employers-charged/) for it when hundreds of their workers are taken away in an ICE raid. In fact, it works out great for companies like Koch Foods, who now don't have to pay those illegal immigrants that they recruited. They get a weeks worth of free labor from a few hundred ""illegals"". And the cycle repeats itself.

The owner of Koch foods, Joseph Grendys, is a billionaire. A billionaire who makes his money by recruiting illegal immigrants to work at his slaughterhouses, and calling in an occasional ICE raid so her doesn't have to pay them. This is who you should be mad at, not the illegal immigrants. Not the ones seeking asylum. If you think illegals are taking your jobs, keep in mind that most American jobs have already been outsourced to China and India. The wealthy people who own these companies will do everything in their power to pay as little as possible to workers, and they will do anything they can to stop government interference. We need stronger laws to keep jobs in the US, to punish companies who profit off illegal immigrant labor, to stop greedy billionaires from profiting off of third world country labor while enjoying first world luxuries. THIS is what should be done, not imprisoning migrants and dissapearing their children into a foster/adoption system.",23Aug2019,1

It's a tough time rn",23Aug2019,2
131,i don't know what to do. a few days ago i was suicidal like wildly suicidal i was literally next to the bridge i was gonna throw myself off and i was fucking delirious and everyone was on the phone telling me not to do it and i crossed the bridge to the other side and there was a kitty cat and she was very nice to me and she led me down a side path away from the bridge so thats what i did and i went home and the police were in my house. my parents had gotten them to look for me and they were out too. and i dont know whats happening i deleted all my social media and my good friend M doesnt want to be my friend anymore bc my mental illness is so out of control and i dont wanna go to therapy because ive been hospitalised etc and ive had therapy and i had bad experiences im sick of talking abt it with them i wont do it. and because im still suicidal it's been days and usually after im suicidal i snap out of it but i still fucking want to die im going to fucking rope myself. im crying typing this im sick of being alive i try to pretend like im better again but i just cant do it this time. ive lost all my friends just bc im so out of control and i wont go to therapy but i fucking refuse i literally cannot take this a second longer i want to die so so so so so so so so bad please ive never wanted to die more. ive always been sad ive been cutting myself since i was 9 i have diary entries where i was sad every day before that talking abt how im sad all the time but this is a new low i didnt think it was possible to feel like this. nobody cares abt me anymore bc im too crazy. literally nobody wants to hear it anymore. i cant stop fucking crying im still suicidal. school starts back on wednesday it's a joke a fucking joke im gonna vomit just thinking about it. im self harming every day which usually makes me feel better and if i feel pain i can function sorta well but nothing's working please please i want to just die. this is too fucking much. i feel like this is incomprehensible but i am in so much pain right now. i dont want to continue this is fucking excruciating please i just want death,23Aug2019,3

I don‚Äôt know what to do next. I‚Äôm in therapy, which is how I was able to recover those memories, but now I wish I hadn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt want to live like this. I‚Äôm so scared.",23Aug2019,4
