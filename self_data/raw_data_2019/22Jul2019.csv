1,"i think i learned about sex WAY too young (older brothers showed me several porn sites when i was maybe 5 or 6) and essentially since then i was extremely uncomfortable by most of the men in my family. i remember feeling paranoid that they’re sexualizing me and constantly assuming they’re thinking the worst or inherently creepy.

so naturally, i never hugged or even sat next to any male relatives, and always made it a point to steer my nieces and other female cousins clear. it eventually manifested its way into my school life when i entered high school. i was so scarred by an innocent pat on the back from a history teacher that i had nightmares for months. it’s even gotten to the point where now as my brothers have gotten older i try to avoid seeing my family at all costs.

i was never sexually abused as a child nor do i have problems befriending or even loving men my age. i’ve been with my boyfriend for 5 years and though i’d love to start a family one day i get anxious that if i have a daughter that his or my family will prey on her if i’m not vigilant. i don’t wanna project the anxieties i grew up with onto my future kids.

how do i ease my paranoia? could this be explained in any way or have i always been irrational and need to dig beneath the surface? idk again just want thoughts

tl;dr i’m scared of middle aged men and i wanna know why and try to fix it",22Jul2019,1
2,"Like really think about it - for me living on for ever and ever and ever is super hard to comprehend and makes me incredibly anxious focus on just being there for eternity and it never ending :O

On the flip side not existing at all is really daunting too not being there at all with nothing at all and never being able to feel joy again ever.

What’s more daunting?

4,"My first post here, bear with me.
I'm a 20f in a relationship with another 20f. We've met through the Internet in 2016 and have been friends since. We had a big fight in 2018 and didn't talk for 11 months after that.
We reconciled November of 2019, both more mature and grounded people. We talked a lot, shared a lot of our feelings and eventually became friends again. I was so happy. I've been in love for years with her, even while we didn't talk for 11 months not a day passed in which I didn't think about her. 
Here comes the part where I hurt her:
It was Silvester. My ptsd had been giving me an incredibly hard time the days leading up to it (baby cousins were over, no time to center myself and loud sudden noises everywhere). I also grabbed a bottle of wine (I used to use alcohol to drown out feelings) and started drinking. She wrote me that night and I, drunk off my ass and feeling like a caged animal, lashed out to her so harshly. I said the things that would hurt her the most in this world. I didn't mean a word of what I said, I lashed out in a moment in which I felt threatened by everything and everyone. I also told her I loved her. Something I meant every word of. 
Soon after we talk about the Silvester night and me being the coward I am only asked her about the confession and not the hurtful things I said. She said she loves me too, she wants to be together and I just let us carry on into a relationship like that. I was so scared of bringing it up, of her really thinking I meant what I said. So I did the stupidest thing I could: I didn't talk about it. 
Fast forward a bit. She brings it up to me and I completely misunderstood her intent. I thought she was attacking me, so I put my defences again and made her hit a complete wall. 
Fast forward again, 2 days ago.
We had a conversation about Silvester again. I hurt her so much, and I only realised it now. She has lost a lot of faith into me, to a degree that she doesn't want to be in a relationship with me anymore. I fucked up something that felt so right, so good. I tried apologising, telling her my side of the story but that doesn't mean anything right now. I've messed up beyond believe and don't know how to handle having fucked up this bad. 
She has me blocked on everything, I think. I don't know if we're broken up but it feels like it. I wish I could turn back time and undo everything I said to hurt her. I'm disgusted by my own behavior and want to make things right. 
Any advice?",22Jul2019,3
5,"I’m 20 years old and I really like 60s music. I don’t think I’m special or anything like that, I know there’s probably a lot of people like me, but I don’t really see people talk about it. I grew up going to my grandparents’ house a lot and they always used the Music Choice TV stations to play 50s and 60s music. I used to hate it when I was younger but I finally started to appreciate it around the age of 14 and now I really love it, I listen to it every day if I can.

I’m not sure if the MC station that we listen to plays a lot of rock music, but music sounded a lot different back then so I could be wrong. I don’t really know the genres of 60s music all that well either. But one of my favorite groups from the 60s is The Mamas and The Papas; they have really great harmonies and I just really like how their songs sound. I also like The Supremes, Connie Francis, Lesley Gore, Sam Cooke, and some others that I can’t really think of right now.

I just wanted to share this because I don’t know anybody else my age who listens to this type of music. I always want to express my interest to my online friends but they aren’t interested in it like I am. But I think music from the 1960s is really nice. :D",22Jul2019,0

12,"TL;DR at the bottom :) 

About 6 months ago my parents divorced. I live with my mom and see my dad every other weekend. I changed schools and family dynamic. My mom was married to a man and now she's marrying a woman within not even 3 months of getting a divorce. They're getting married in August. I don't have a problem with it or anything, but it's a bit fast if anything else. I really miss my old school and my friends, and that hurts me more than anything else in this. Because my whole social life went down the drain. Nobody keeps in touch with me even though I reach out. And I want them back more than anything. My dad, is moving back into the district in less than a year and he said if I REALLY wanted to, I could move in with him and go back to my old school. Thing is, I'd be leaving behind my little brother and my new brother (he's the son of the woman my mom is marrying). But to be honest, the relationship between me and my mom and my dad is a whole other issue, and so if I can get a part of my life back that I had, I would but at what cost? Would I be selfish if I left them for my friends, or should I do what's best for mentally and go back to all the people I know? It's really hard for me and has bugged me for a few weeks. My mom would never let me move out, but they have 50 / 50 custody over me so ultimately I would end up leaving if my dad pushed for it and I backed him. I just really don't know what to do. 

TL;DR my parents divorced and I had to switch schools, but my dad is moving back into my old school district and if I move with him I could go, but I'd be leaving behind my mother brother and some new family cause my mom is remarrying.",22Jul2019,1
13,"I (24M) am a very communicative, outspoken person. I love writing, speaking and I will take on every opportunity to interact with someone, whether that is virtually or in person. The problem is: I tend to be very ironic, sarcastic, but I never saw it as an issue. To me, it is fun and a form of speech through which I express my wit. 

From my family, boyfriend to close friends, however, they have all complained that, sometimes, it can be rude and upsetting to them and I would like to know if there is any way I can tone it down to avoid hurting the people I love. 

It is not mean spirited, but my mother said I often come off as cynic, disdainful, and I would like to reeducate myself to be more considerate of other people's feelings when I talk. How do I do that?

23,"A few months ago I [M20] finished a spring semester at college. A bit before school ended I started dating this girl [F20] I had met several months prior. We found out we had a lot in common and eventually officially started dating.  I was really excited since it was my first semi-serious relationship. I had seen one girl before, but it was really just a couple dates and we weren’t compatible.

I really liked this girl at first. We had a lot in common when it comes to movies, TV, music, etc, and before we started dating we’d talk about them all the time. I also thought we had pretty similar personalities. The relationship is a little long distance right now, which obviously makes things more difficult. We would try to text often and we’d usually be able to see each other once a week or once every two weeks. We moved pretty slowly intimately and never got *too* far in that regard.

She’s still a great person, but lately I’ve been having this gut feeling to break up with her. I’ve been thinking about it a lot and I’m not sure what to do. Even though there’s nothing *wrong* per se, I feel like our relationship hasn’t really gone that far even though we’ve been together a few months. We still talk about the same stuff and haven’t had real deep relationship discussions. I’ve also just found that I think I might not be that interested in her anymore, but I can’t completely explain why.

I think that she maybe acts a little immature for her age, but I don’t think that’s necessarily a bad thing. It also just seems like she’s a lot more interested in me than I am in her. I wouldn’t say she’s clingy, but she likes me a lot. I’ve found myself not thinking about her quite as much lately, which I know sounds horrible, but it’s the truth. Maybe our personalities don’t mesh as well as I thought. She can be really passionate about things, but not in the way that I am. Obviously we aren’t going to be carbon copies of each other, but I just don’t think we vibe well in some ways.

Despite this I feel like I can’t pinpoint a reason why I might want to break up with her, and it just ends up making me feel anxious. I’ve never had to break up with someone, and I don’t know if I would be jumping the gun. I wouldn’t really be able to break up with her face to face, and calling her to do it terrifies me. I keep thinking I need a real big reason to break up with her, and I’m afraid I won’t find someone if I do. I don’t find myself into a lot of the girls I run into at my school, but it would be cruel to be with someone just to be in a relationship with them. I’m just very torn and am leaning toward breaking up, but this is all new for me. I know I should maybe wait a bit and think more, but this has been eating at me for several days now.",22Jul2019,6
24,"This throwaway is my only Reddit account and it's probably my last. I wanted help. This isn't working. At least they tried.

I get a couple neat responses to my posts but for most, it gives me that same feeling you get when you tell someone ""I'm depressed"" and the response you get back is ""well what's been making you so sad?""  In one ear and right out the other. Doesn't click. I want it to click. Does someone out there click?

Certain tones feel cold. They hurt. Phrases like ""there's nothing you can do about it"", ""that's just the way the world works"", ""I'm sorry but you'll just have to accept it"". It turns my stomach. I don't want to hear it.

I'm trying to find my home. I'm a haphazard mishmash of several personality types. The extroverted introvert. The LGBTQ+ proponent who gets incredibly uncomfortable around certain LGBTQ+ types. That hyper and somehow simultaneously quiet kid everyone likes but nobody necessarily understands. The one who will seek closeness and then promptly push it all away. The manic yet numb, compassionate yet sadistic paradoxical contradiction of a human being.

Nobody knows. Or am I wrong? Everyone is being mean. Why are they mean?
Why don't they understand?
They're trying to prove me wrong and tell me I am selfish. Are they? I'm not selfish, am I? Maybe I am.
I just want happy times. I'm grasping at straws but nobody's taking them. Am I taking advantage of people? Am I selfish? I never thought so. Some people think I'm selfish.
My favorite pastimes are attention and pleasure. Is something the matter? Do you think I'm selfish? Why doesn't anyone answer? I'm not really sure what I am.

48,"So my boyfriend just told me about the ""last girl he fell in love with"". And now i'm worried he still may have feelings for her.

He first asked this girl out in May last year in 2018. But she was really focussed on trying to work on herself.

She really liked him too, but she kept making excuses. He tried calling her in early June and several times in late June. She avoided all four calls. He sent a few messages in between, to which she didn't reply. Again, there was no contact till August, where he left another voice message. She didn't pick up. He called again in November. Again, she didn't pick up.

It wasn't till about Christmas time that she finally responded to him. She told him that she really liked him but she needed to work herself. And he kept telling her that he'd wait for her. And that ""she was it for him"". She told him several times that he didn't have to wait for her, because there was a lot that she wanted to work on about herself. But he kept insisting that he'd wait for her. So from this point, they talked everyday from December till March. Most nights till about 4 am. The both of them are apparently so similar in so many ways. To put into context how quickly their feelings escalated, he went out one night on a drunk night out and called her about 14 times telling her over and over again that he was going to marry her. He recovered the next day and said that he remembered what he said the night before and he had no regrets.

So in March, she found some random odd excuse to end it. Obviously, he was quite angry. But very numb and a little mad. And then they stopped talking. She removed him from Facebook and Instagram. We started dating three weeks later.

So she hasn't posted anything on social media in over a year, and he doesn't follow her on any social media accounts because like I said previously, she had removed him. But last night she posted some instagram stories. I noticed that within a few hours of posting, he had watched them all. He also liked her first ever instagram post. But he says it was an accident. But how could he have known that she posted something if he wasn't keeping tabs on her everyday? It's especially concerning since it has been five months since they last talked?

Do you guys think he still has feelings for her?

It's not that I want to be known, or I want people to admire me. I just want power. A lot of power. First of all I live in a republic. We haven't had a king since XVIII century. I want to be the first one in over 200 years. 
But I don't want to be the king like the British Queen, without any power or true responsibilities. I want to be THE king. The ruler. I don't know whether or not would I be a great king, but I just desire the crown and power which comes with it.
It's even more, I often claim that I am a nobleman due to my surname, which has noble roots. I can feel the blue blood pumping through my veins.

53,"This may be a long one...but I am just so happy and excited that I wanted to share it with this reddit community! I just feel like I’ve accomplished this huge hurdle in my life to finally do something I’ve always wanted to pursue. 
To really start things off...I just wanted to say that this has been a lifelong dream to pursue a career in emergency medical services. It really started when I was in 2nd grade and watched 9/11 on the news...on such a tragic day, I couldn’t help but feel inspired by the first responders. Their dedication, bravery, and selflessness resonated so powerfully in my 8 year old self, I knew that I wanted to be a first responder way back then. 
As Mister Rogers’ mother said “Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.” 
To me, first responders were always a pillar of hope and heroes to me...that I’ve always wanted to be like them.
However, as time went on and while growing up...I kept getting discouraged by people, my family, friends, teachers, coaches, etc. they would always tell me 
“why be a paramedic? You should be a doctor or nurse instead. They get paid more.” 
“Why would you want to work that when you can do something that pays more?” 
“Don’t be a paramedic, you won’t be able to handle it.” 
“You won’t do well as a paramedic.” “Be a nurse, don’t be a paramedic. They get paid more.” 
“You think you are smart enough for that? I don’t think so.” 
It was always about money, money, money. I’m Filipino so to all my Filipinos out there...I’m pretty sure you know how it goes. I always tried to believe that they would say those things to me out of the goodness of their hearts and they wanted the best for me. So I listened...for many years.
However, when I was in high school I decided to pursue a health oriented pathway, where all my elective classes consisted of A&amp;P, health studies, forensics, and the like. I loved every single one of those classes and was so passionate about them, I knew I wanted to pursue the a career in the medical profession. Then...one day when it was just my grandma and I at home, I noticed that something was wrong. The how she slurred her words, how she could barely walk and spilled her drink when she went to grab it. The very same day in my health class, we learned signs of stroke and heart attack. I knew, at that very moment time was of the essence, she was having a stroke. I drove her to the hospital (we can’t afford an ambulance and my grandma is stubborn), brought her to the ER just in time...they said that if I had brought her any time later...she wouldn’t have made it. It was such a massive stroke she was hospitalized for a month and 2 months in a care home. I knew...I wanted to still pursue a career in the medical profession to protect and help my loved ones. I’m 
Cut to college, I decided to pursue a health related major saying that I would try and get into medical school. Really what I was doing was saying those things to get people off my back. I wanted to tell them what they wanted to hear...but every time I did I knew in my heart I’ve always wanted to be an EMT/Paramedic. I wanted to get into the program right out of high school but my mom and grandma wouldn’t help me with college if I decided that. So instead I took classes to fulfill med school requirements. Tbh I loved learning all of it and it was a good experience but I still was too afraid to tell anyone my true desire. 
After 5 years of college (I decided to study abroad to London that held me back), I finally graduated with a Bachelors. But I still felt like I wasn’t pursuing what I wanted...I ended getting so anxious and depressed, I had to take a year break because my health got so bad. 

Then...all of a sudden I just thought to myself “Fuck it...just do it.”

Soon enough I ended up telling my friends and my closest family members my goal to be an EMT/P. How it has always been my dream. I was so scared, I was ready for them to reject what I said because really...that was how I grew up. Always being rejected and telling me to do other “better” things.

They said...

“Do it. You got this.” 

The amount of relief that I felt when I heard this from my best friends and closest family...I couldn’t help but cry. 
They believed in me.
 
I turned in my application, did my interview to get in the program, thought I did shit...but got a call an hour later.  
Apparently they liked me so much, I was picked into the program immediately right after I stepped out the door.

I cried. I felt so much relief. The happiness I felt is still being felt today although I was told I got accepted last week. I can’t help but smile at random times when I zone out. Pretty sure I look like a creep but I’m just so damn happy. 

This is a stepping stone to a career I’ve always dreamed of and I can’t wait for this next chapter to happen. 

The program starts at the end of August (gotta do all the vaccines and blood work for the program)...but I cant fucking wait. I’m so excited that I’ll be having nervous, excited poops for the next month until my program starts.  
I’m just so happy and excited guys.

He sent a few messages in between, to which she didn't reply. Again, there was no contact till August, where he left another voice message. She didn't pick up. He called again in November. Again, she didn't pick up.

We got our best friend when we were first married in 2007. My husband was an abusive alcoholic at that time, but he soon got help and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, personality disorder, anxiety (crippling at times), and more recently agoraphobia. He has been sober for 7 years and our dog has been his loyal sidekick through it all. He has been there for me through my own battles as well but my husband, who is at home alone all day every day (he is on disability), has spent more time with him than he has spent with any human. 

I know he will lash out once our dog is gone. He, unfortunately, tends to believe that his anger/hurt/sadness is worse than mine and because of that he will not be there to support me, I will spend the entire time supporting him and trying to manage my feelings the best I can on my own. I not only have to deal with losing my dog, but also the horrible depression it will hurl my husband into. I am scared because no matter how bad my husband's depression has gotten, or how out of control he has spiraled, my dog has always been there for me. Now I'm going to be fighting this one alone. 

What can I do to help my husband through this? How can I keep him stable? He doesn't like to leave the house. His parents are the only people we ever do anything with. I tried to talk to him last night to remind him that this is a tragedy we are both going through and we need to lean on each other. He said he doesn't need to take advice from me ...

78,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I live in a rented condo with my partner who I've been with for 8 years. When things are good, things are great, but it never lasts long. Every other week she runs off to stay with her mom and dad, her brother, her friends, because of something I've supposedly done - which I haven't - and she insists that I have. In the end, I accept responsibility because it's easier to say sorry than it is to actually say anything back to her. 

I know I'm not innocent, God knows I've said some things in the heat of the moment but I've always owned up to it and apologised for it. She consistently says she ""hates me"", supposedly breaks up with me every week only to come back and live with me less than a week later with no contact, she refuses to admit that what she said was too far and tells me I deserved it. 

It's getting to the stage where it's hard to talk to people about. People tell me ""oh you always do this, she'll be back stop being a pussy"" because it happens so fucking often. I don't want to leave her or for her to leave me, I love her more than anyone I've ever met, but I don't know how long I can keep this up for. 

She refuses to listen to my point of view, she refuses to understand where I'm coming from because her instant response is to shout and swear at me and to call me horrible names.  She refuses to admit she is ever wrong, so I always end up admitting it just to keep the peace. 

She doesn't do any house work. She sits around eating chips all night just leaving the packets lying around for me to pick up. She leaves the throw lying on the couch when it would take two minutes to put away. She doesn't dust anything, she doesn't clean anything, she doesn't vacuum, she doesn't even make the bed in the morning.

Despite her flaws, her temper, the insults, I still love her more than anyone. I have always remained faithful to her as I absolutely 100% know and trust she has remained faithful to me. I love her smile, her hair, her eyes, her stupid humour. I just wish she wouldn't take so many bad moods out on me when all I try to do is help her. 

It wasn't always like this. We used to be happy, we used to be so happy all the time. We used to actually show affection, now it feels like a chore for the both of us. I don't know what's changed, whether it's me or her or it's moving in together, but this is absolutely unbearable. 

I've been absolutely clear to her since the start, if she wants to leave, she can leave. I will not beg and force her to be in a relationship if she doesn't want to be in it. I would love for us to just put all this shit aside and get along, but shit like this happens every fucking week so it's getting to the stage where half of me hopes she just leaves, because I don't have the balls to do it myself without collapsing. I hope it gets better, but I'm not holding my breath.

For some background information: I work for a large MNC. Recently my boss informed my department that a career development opportunity had opened up in another department and he was looking for 4 team members to volunteer to join on an urgent basis. I strongly expressed my disinterest in the role due to the nature of the job, and also due to the extreme operating hours.  3 of my team members volunteered to go, and my boss was struggling to find a 4th member to volunteer. My boss advised that he would do a ballot to select the 4th team member. However, this never actually happened. Later that day, my boss announced that a 4th person had volunteered and he thanked all of us for our cooperation. The very next day, I was informed by my boss that he had made a decision to move me to the other department, as I had no leaves planned for the rest of the year. I expressed to him that I was really not interested in the role at all, and would not be able to cope with the operating hours. He explained to me that I really had no choice in the matter as I was their last resort. I would also not be given any allowance to take leave during this duration. 

As you can imagine, I was extremely frustrated and pissed off about this situation that I wrote an email to HR to see if there was anything they could do to address my concerns. However, they have yet to reply. So I decided to go directly to my department head who responded positively to my concerns and said he would follow up on the case. My question is, am I wrong to override my boss and write to HR or speak directly with my department head? And can I be forced against my will to do a job that I was not originally contracted to do?

I used to be a bit desperate and sought friendships and relationships but I didn't have the time or energy to maintain them. Also, I'm generally pretty tired after my job and not as cheerful or positive as I would like to be. As for the only good  friend I made in the past year, I had feelings for her and she didn't feel the same way - so things got awkward between us and we stopped talking. I had developed quite a negative attitude towards life and to get out of the rough patch, I've been going to the gym pretty regularly for about a month now. Overall, I'm feeling a lot better - I lost some weight (lost around 7 kilos in the past year) and I am recovering my self-confidence. However, I've a busy routine and I feel like nothing's going to change this semester in terms of friendships. So, is it okay to be lonely?

* Enjoy casual board games like 7 Wonders or Small World, but honestly think D&amp;D is a little childish at this age

* Are not great at sports but still enjoy playing them.

88,"Yeah, you heard me. They're bullshit.

But it's not the parades themselves that I hate. Nor is it the people that these things celebrate.

What I hate is that they even need to be a thing. A day/week/month/whatever dedicated to it being normal to love someone who's the same gender is mental.

Why can't love (or just plain old sex) be just that? Who cares what fucking orientation someone is?

Now this isn't aimed at that community in the slightest...which is another bone of contention for me. The ""gay community"" or the ""LGBTQ community""...WTF? Why is that classed as its own separate entity to being straight?

Now, this isn't aimed at anyone from that ""community"", and the fact that these parades give a lot of people a time and space in which to feel ""normal"" is awesome. What's NOT awesome is that there are so many people who have grown up being made to believe that they *weren't* normal. (WTF is normal, anyway?)

It's great that we're turning a huge corner and younger generations are being born into a world that's slowly beginning to be accepting of people's orientations, but I look forward to the day when people just stop caring and gay pride can be a thing of the past along with the bigoted views that caused it to ever be a thing.

Now, maybe I haven't articulated this the right way, but I hope people understand this is in NO WAY meant to be a hate post or anything like that. Well, I suppose it is, but I hope you understand where all of that hate is directed.

Love each other (whoever that may be) but, more importantly, love yourselves.

It's simply a new-age buzzword for computer software, which is written by people. Our only real threat is malicious people who abuse technology to harm others. Sure, you *could* have an ""evil AI"" if somebody were to code that. Doesn't mean the AI itself is dangerous, it's the people creating it who are the threat.


So why the hell would we fight this ""problem"" by putting an implant in our brain, that will allow such malicious strangers to directly and easily abuse, kill and control us, and we won't even have a mind to fight back? That makes perfect sense, Elon Musk. Are you sure you're not trying to destroy humanity yourself?

100,"As the title says, my dad has gout. He was diagnosed back in 2012, I believe. For the most part, hes done an incredible job avoiding high uric acid foods such as mushrooms, cabbage, red meat and citrus fruits. My entire family has done a great job keeping it out of the house in general. Most foods he cant have are his favorites so we try not to be assholes by taunting him with it. 


Last week, my family basically poisoned him.

 This is how my dad's day went: (relevant events only)

- Went to breakfast with his buddies, had corned beef hash (so red meat already)
- Came home and did some stuff around the house (light activity)
- He and my mom went to a get together located at a bar, so dinner was not an option.
- Came home and snuck some of the pizza we bought into his bedroom (like a child)

Thinking we had the house to ourselves and dinner was our responsibility, my brothers and I decided to get pizza from Walmart. Brother had friends over so we were just trying to feed the heathens as cheaply as possible. This was also the first time we had bought specifically Walmart brand pizza, not some frozen Digornio or whatever. It didnt even dawn on us to check the ingredients because we thought my dad would be eating elsewhere! None of us knew he took the last few slices of pizza.

The next day, my dad is writhing in pain. We had no fucking clue what happened. We always kept such a good eye out for mushrooms (those are his true enemies, delicious but the worst on his gout). We had already tossed out the box, and trash was picked up so we couldn't dig through the dumpster to find it. Brother went back to Walmart and checked out the ingredients- THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF RED MEAT. AND MUSHROOMS IN THE SAUCE, AND UNDER THE CHEESE/MEAT. NOBODY FUCKING NOTICED THIS. NOT AT ALL. 


So now, my dad for the past week has been unable to walk on his own. Luckily for me, a lady I was helping move out of her house was giving crutches away so I swooped up on those real fast. But now, my mom isnt sleeping because she worried my dad will slip and fall and hurt himself or break something. Her not sleeping is unfair. I tell her this time and time again, there are 3 other adults in this house, dont stress too much. Last night, I made her sleep in the living room so she'd actually fall asleep and hit REM. I stayed up to tend to my dad til he fell asleep and my boyfriend kept an ear out until 2am. This morning, my mom was back to her bright eyed and bushy tailed self. She was thankful.

 This morning, I also had to tell my dad that he cant be prideful or modest anymore. Hes always been a very independent man. His dad died needing someone to wipe his ass at 60 so I'm sure that adds to his own issues. But I had to tell my 52 year old father that hes not in the position to pick and choose, that if he wants to deny our help because of pride, then he can proudly sit in pain. He kept apologizing and saying hes an imposition. I got tired of his attitude and said ""You need to stop. If I didnt want to help, I wouldn't. If you were an imposition, I'd have asked someone else to help you. I want to help, I want to be here for you but you're fighting me on this. You need help, and theres nothing wrong with that, dad. I am willing to help you if you allow me. So stop fighting me on this."" He admitted hes been stubborn and asked me to help him. My mom and I are worried that his kidneys are having issues. He had no health or life insurance, so any treatment he receives is out of pocket. 


Has anyone, with gout, had a flair up last longer than a week? Did your limb turn red and swollen? Does it look like a diabetics swollen limb, but not diabetic? I'm worried that this one fucked up pizza is the end of my dad's mobility and possibly his life. I know if he had to lose his foot, he'll just give up like his father did. I dont want that. My dad isnt the nicest man, and definitely wasnt a kind man when I was growing up, but hes still my dad and I want him to be the best he can be in any way.",22Jul2019,1

105,"The title pretty much explains everything, but I will provide some background.

My friend group is very mixed: guys and girls, normies and nerds, open and closed people. I (21F) am the most normie girl of our group. I already am in an open relationship wit another guy in our friend group. Such relationships are not weird, we are all in our early 20s and just trying to find out what we want. Since a few weeks, I am developing a new relationship with a guy friend. I always saw him as my gay best friend who I could tell everything,even though he is not gay at all.
We have not done a lot but the relationship is moving forward pretty fast. Last night, 6 of my friends were over at my house. My parents are on holiday so we could go all out. Around 2 in the morning, we decided to go on a walk to the little playground 300 metres away. We all had fun, but my back was hurting from the way I was sitting on top of a little play house so I decided to move to a bench 10 metres away. He followed me, which is not weird as all friends take time to talk one on one. However, we did not talk. We ended up kissing pretty quickly.
After 30 minutes, people started to get cold so we walked back. I gave my house key to a friend who needed to use the toilet really bad and wanted to get back quick. I was however not walking that fast due to a ankle injury.
Me and the guy took another route home, but did not complete that route. We doubled back to the playground. Now alone, we ended up kissing more and a little bit louder.
We were both ready to have sex but did not bring a condom and since I am not on any form of birth control, we decided against it. We kept kissing and some other stuff for about 20 more minutes before going back. Only 1 girl knew something had happened but that is only because she is aware of our relationship. The rest did not miss us at all.

109,"32(m) and I’ve come to realize that I am not passionate about anything. I live a pretty easy going and simple life in a small town. 

At a family gathering this weekend, a small group of us, were sitting and talking about random stuff. Somehow the topic of being passionate about something came up and I couldn’t come up with anything I’m passionate about. A couple others were the same way that were older than I am. Not that age really matters in the equation. I’m happy for the people who have a passion and for whatever reason, I found it a little depressing that I couldn’t come up with anything. 

I do love to fish and be outdoors. But I wouldn’t say that’s a passion of mine. The closest thing I could say would be shed hunting but even then I haven’t had the time to get out and do it that much for the last couple years.

You ever hear the story of Larry Walters? A California man straps himself to a very expensive lawn chair with 40-some-odd weather balloons he got at a Army/Navy Surplus. Larry Walters went 16,000 feet in the air and for reference, altitude sickness occurs at 5,000 feet. He took a 35mm camera with him, and took zero pictures because he wanted to take it all in. Now you might think that's insane, but I think it's exactly what a person is supposed to do. Not that exactly, but things in the spirit of it.

I think we are living a cursed existence. I work 50 hours a week, and barely scrape by because the cost of living is so high. I am married to someone who thinks I'm a pathetic loser because I'm grieving for too long for the best friend I'll ever have. She insults me in front of our family and friends, belittles me and berates me. And I take it, because I don't know what else to do. I have one friend in the area that I live in, and all he wants to do is drink and complain about his job. I'm a hop, skip, and jump away from buying an expensive lawn chair, 40-some-odd weather balloons, and taking my chances with the winds. 

I won't ever do that or anything like it, though, because in my heart I am a coward. I need to keep on working and living with my wife because if I don't, I might write a book, go back to charity work, or something else that will make me happy. That would be truly awful. Because I'm too busy punishing myself for losing that best friend. If I'm happy, I'm betraying him. 

Anyway, humanity. There was this judge who sold black teenagers to prisons in Texas. He gave false guilty sentencings to hundreds of them for profit. Internet scammers prey on the weak and ignorant and desperate for profit. Epstein and all the terrible things he did. Slavery is still alive and well, but America is still too busy patting itself on the back about abolishing it to even report on the world wide slave trade in the media. People intentionally spread misinformation on vaccines for profit. Sexism, racism, and anti-Semitism are still rampant everywhere on Earth. Sure all that stuff existed a hundred years ago, too, but I feel like the fact that it still exists after so many generations is a big red flag for humanity. Like maybe we're not all that great. Maybe we don't deserve the earth we're destroying. Maybe we don't deserve to be loved and held and cared for. 

Maybe we shouldn't have given Ben Affleck an academy award for screenwriting. Did that really lead to **anything** good?

119,"i’m not exactly sure how to start this post but a few months ago, i lost my virginity with a guy i’m hooking up, and i feel like shit over it now.

a few months ago, a guy i met this guy. suddenly, i was this hormonal teenager every time i was with him. 

we messed around for a bit. only making out and going down on each other. eventually, i was at his place and he’s sticking his dick into my vagina. ever since then, we would often see each other to have sex. we were sort of in a *‘situationship’* / *’friends with benefits’* kind of thing. 

suddenly, our situation, whatever that was, ended. terribly. and every time i’d look back, i’d feel my heart break a little and i know it’s my fault. it dawned on me that i didn’t ‘lose it’ the way i truly wanted to. i guess, i didn’t know myself enough to realize that then. i have no one to blame aside from myself because i consented to it. i feel so shitty about it now, and i always think to myself that ‘maybe i should’ve done it with someone who genuinely loves me and has feelings for me, rather than with a guy who’d ghost me.’

i know that virginity is a social construct, but i don’t know, i guess, deep inside me, i wish it hadn’t been that way. i wish i had my first with someone who wouldn’t leave like that. and maybe, i’m feeling this way because he was the first guy i ever slept with, thus i have this weird attachment and longing for him.

yes, i learned and grew from it as it put a lot of things in a better perspective for me and what i want in relationships now, but there are still days, where i get this heavy feeling of regret, and i’d cry and cry about it. i never knew that my first sex experience would mean to me that much the more i think about it now. how do i cope with this heavy feeling? how do i stop blaming my 18 year old self for this? every time i see something sexual or even the thought of anything sexual, it makes me think of how my first time went, and it sucks to look back at it in that light.",22Jul2019,1

However, if I really think about it, I feel like this ""insecurity"" has been a real insecurity but no longer is and that I just ""played"" as if it still was. I don't even know why, because I wouldn't get anything from being mad.. 
- I saw that my boyfriend didn't call me ""my love"" but ""love"".

But then, I thought that maybe... It was really a sign!!! And I became very anxious even if I think that ""my true self"" never would have made a big deal of this.

126,"So, a quick bit about ""old me"". She was a self-entitled, always had to be right, always had to have the last word type of person with a huge temper/anger issue. She was a big scrapper in highschool. I've been working very hard to be a better me. The anger issue was the hardest thing to kick. I had a couple of years of anger management (court-ordered) and even though at the moment I thought it was stupid, I still use some techniques today. Ex. not taking things so personally, letting go of being right, and breathing techniques. 

The most helpful activity was training Jui Jitsu. Yeah, it taught me to be a badass grappler but more importantly, it taught me how to deal with confrontation, focus, patience, and to combat being compulsive by thinking before acting. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now to my crazy parking lot lady story. I was going to park and had slowed down to let oncoming traffic to go by before turning left into an open spot. I noticed back up lights to my right and saw a car was about to back right into my side. I beeped my horn and got the hell out of the way by pulling forward. I parked thinking to myself how close that was. I wasn't mad. She probably just didn't see me, no big deal. No harm no foul. Then I noticed she was waiting for me to get out of my car. I took my time hoping she would leave, knowing I don't do well with confrontation. 

She wasn't going anywhere so I got out and just tried to move along. She started yelling at me saying about how I had the nerve to honk at her and that I needed to slow down. You may remember I was stopped waiting to pull into a parking spot. I said something along the lines of how I'm happy I honked because you would have backed right into me. I started to walk away and she said: ""you're lucky I don't get out of this car ugly bitch"". I'll admit I said ""piss off "" and walked away thinking that be the end of it. NOPE. She hopped out of her car which was in the middle of the driving lane and starts coming at me. Old me would be waiting for confrontations like this. Old me would have LOVED to pummel her..... Ok, new me still wanted to kick her ass..... But, new me knew the retribution wouldn't be worth it. She took one swing at me. I dodged it by just stepping back. Now, the rest is a little blurry. I know I just kept repeating I'm not going to fight you, I won't hit you while keeping my distance from her. Then some other lady said something to us or to her, not sure. But, crazy parking lot lady started to turn her anger on that lady and cussed at her and then got back in her car and drove away. Just like that. It was over.

I know the 3rd party lady asked me if I was ok, but I didn't reply to her. I was full of adrenaline and still trying to understand what all happened. I just walked into the store.

 The amount of anger I was feeling was mind-numbing. I imagined throwing an entire shopping cart at her. I imagined a lot of mean, horrible, awful things I would have done in response to her behavior. But the important part is I didn't do any of them. I finally wasn't the crazy one. It's been hours later and I'm still mad, but very proud of myself. I called my mom to tell her what happened and she even was surprised. She thought I was calling to tell her I've been arrested. 

I'm so fucking proud of myself. I know it may seem little but to me, it was a big test that I actually passed.

127,"Something I've started doing recently is counting the number of unique plants I see wherever I walk. It forces me to look around me and really take in my environment when I'm walking rather than going on autopilot, and makes me appreciate how much nature there is when you look for it (at least where I live.)

The reason I count the types of plants rather than just the number of plants is because this way I start paying attention to the differences, and it adds visual details to my mental map of my route to work that I didn't have before. You don't need to be a botanist, just to enjoy the natural things around you.

The exact count doesn't matter either - it's not a test. It's the noticing which is important, and noticing my environment isn't something I usually do.

If you live in a desert or somewhere with no greenery at all, then count the buildings, people, different types of clothing, shops, etc. Find any way you can to notice and appreciate the environment where you live.",22Jul2019,9

I'm 17M from Slovakia. I have a problem with my friends. I think used to think I have many friends. Like in my class or in my ex class. But recently I realized that it's not true. For everyone I'm just that ""side friend"" with whom you talk when everyone is busy. I don't have best friend nor I don't have female friends. I might have some sort of anxiety. I don't talk to people out of my class or family. Now on holidays just sitting at home, sometimes walking around neighborhood for achieving 10000 steps. That's all I do. I don't know how to make friends. I don't want to be that side friend anymore. I want live. Going out with someone. Maybe find a girlfriend... I would love to hear some advice from you.

129,"I am at a truck stop in the bootheel of Missouri. I see bumper stickers with Donald Trump pissing on the word ""Liberals,"" ""I lived through Obama, so you can live through Trump,"" A stick figure engaging in coitus with the letter ""U,"" another one with ""it,"" you get the idea. All targeted toward the conservative demographic. However, on the very same rack of bumper stickers was a cross with the words ""Christ Life"" adorning it.

I've always been aware of the irony that many conservatives love to hate others, then justify that hate using a figure that is supposed to represent compassion and love for thy fellow man. That was no surprise to me. The visual representation of that irony is what momentarily stunned me.",22Jul2019,5
130,"

As long as I remember, I was always different. Not in a cool way, but in a way that proved to be disastrous. I am hypersensitive and as a child, possessed maturity greater than most amongst my age group. I was physically abused as a child. I believe the fact that I came to realize the behaviour was wrong and not just ""something that just is"" made me feel worse. It made me feel less, a feeling I still deal with today. The abuse stopped around after my tenth birthday, but the damage had been done. 

Since I was little, I found it hard to associate with people. I never could make eye contact with anyone. I am filled with stress whenever I talk to anyone. This made me seem aloof. I was bullied. I was large, and thus physically quite strong, but it did not make up for my weak mind, and that was what people took advantage of. This made me colder and more distant. 

So I turned to books (novels). They were enjoyable, but they hurt because everywhere I looked, I saw friends. 
I wanted friends. I wanted to be liked, to be understood. I wanted to have relationships too. I would see my classmates go out on parties, hang out, talk for hours. I never had that and it hurt. 
And wherever I found the rare friend, I would do everything I could to make sure we wouldn't stop being friends. And yes, my poor social skills enabled me to make the worse out of myself. They all left me and I don't blame them. I don't have the tools required to be a friend. It's now come to the point, that I overthink every action someone takes because I'm so scared I might be hated. But as fate has it, one often meets it on the road he takes to avoid it. 
All these failures made me worse. I had to leave schools and continue homeschooling because of the bullying. I thought of making friends online, the only means through which I could venture out into the world in a fashion, but I only ended up feeling worse. 

And since then I live in isolation, away from anyone my age. My parents have changed so I live with them since I'm still studying. I visit a therapist, but the road is long, and it occasionally feels I'll never any closer to the finish line. So now, I'm an observer now. I have people I like, people I love, so I'll just watch them move forward in life, never interfering, no matter how much I want I want to be a part of it. Nobody wants to be hurt and I don't want to feel more pain than I already do. 

I just wanted to vent out how I've been feeling lately. Sorry for the long read.",22Jul2019,1

133,"My sister is back in jail for possession of meth. We all thought she was doing better. She is in a different state and I can't even go see her. I'm upset about it but we've been dealing with this for ten years now so I'm not shocked.

I did find out today that my mother had a prescription for vicadin written in my name and took half of it and gave me the rest in a ziplock bag. I had oral surgery at the office where she works and was not healing well. I don't have insurance so she offered to get me pain meds. When she showed up to my apartment with 9 pills in a ziplock I was confused but also disoriented and in pain so I didn't think much of it. My brother's girlfriend works with her and I asked her to check my records. Sure enough, a script for 16 vicadin was filled and she gave me 9. I needed more at the end and she told me that's all that she had. 

She's been sending up all kinds of red flags. Offering to hold on to brothers gf's meds (for endometriosis and related anxiety) bc she ""doesn't trust"" that she won't abuse them. Thank God gf said no and now keeps them in a safe. On top of that I know what withdrawals look like and when my mom complains that the pharmacy or doctor won't give her pain killers she goes into full withdrawals then says, ""I don't know why I feel so sick."" She also wants me to fight to get on my boyfriend's insurance as a domestic partner so I can see a pain specialist. I don't need one. She just wants me to get meds so she could ask to have them.

I don't know what to do. My brother and his gf still live with my parents and will for at least another 6 months while they save for their own place. If I confront my mom it puts them in an awful situation. I would cut all ties with her but I love my dad and would miss him so much. I'm at a loss. I see my therapist in August but keeping my mouth shut in the meantime is hard. 

TL;DR: my mom is a drug addict and I just learned she stole pills from me. Can't fight her bc it will hurt family members I care about. Completely lost and don't know what to do.",22Jul2019,2

This included taking over the universe and thanos snapping half of the population, wanting to get rid of half the male population and singing really sad songs. The next morning they was really mad at me and we argued because at the time I didnt remember everything that happened the previous night. They was also mad that me staring into the abyss seeing diamonds reminds them of something fucked up a family member did to them and also they thought I was going to kill them during being stoned. Later in the day I apologized and everything seemed fined for the next couple of days other than the occasional flair up. However we have not spoken in a week. They have not responded to my messages to which I perceive that they are still mad at me. I also did remember more of what happened that night and I did say some pretty far out there stuff. I would understand why someone uncomfortable but the ""killing"" part I'm not sure how they felt that.

147,"I've been contemplating on my fears and anxieties a lot lately, which all seem to boil down to death. 

Death is terrific, yet terrifying. With death comes many great things, such as resolutions, and revolutions. And although I understand the good of death, I am a living being, and as such, I have been programmed to be terrified. 

I often ponder about the past, the times in which my matter existed, but my consciousness was far from creation. Why is it that I can look back and have no fear of my lack of existence, yet when I look into the future, nothing terrifies me more than ceasing to exist? Is it mearly nature's will, the instinct that is bread into all living creatures? Will I continue to be scared of death when I am looking him in the eye? I wish I knew the answers to these questions, better yet, I wish that any living creature that has experienced death could answer these questions for me. 

My particles, the building blocks of my existence, have no fear of death. The individual cells which make up my mind and body have no fear of death. Yet, fears continue to rattle me to my very core. Will I be killed by the disease that was conceived with my very existence? Or will I die because of my bad habits, the same habits that allow me to cope with the inevitable? 
Am I even afraid of death, or am I afraid of the uncertainty in which death will occur?

No matter how it happens, it will happen, and at some point I have to accept it and move on.",22Jul2019,1

Today I am socalist, last year I was liberal, before that conservative. Who knows, maybe tomorrow I'll be conservative again.

It doesn't just apply to political opinions of course, just using it as a general example. 

And people who dig at you to hear your views on things like sexuality and other sensitive subjects, so they can tell you that you are somehow accidentally a homophobe, or that you are an unaware racist, or whatever it may be because even though you don't have a negative view on these minorities somehow your positive view isn't progressive enough. Oh you care about transexual individuals? Why don't you want a pin or bumper sticker? You ashamed,  you should be proud to support etc etc. Nah fam, I just go to work, hang with my friends and sometimes smoke chronic. I don't want to get involved in your social rampage,  I kind of just want to find myself and solve my own personal crisis' I don't have the energy or time to worry about everyone elses.

 Just treat everyone nice, even people you dislike. We are all going to die, and if you have no belief of an afterlife, you showboating how involved or great you are ultimately doesn't matter. Nobody is going to remember you yelling at some uneducated mennonite. 

Maybe not everyone experiences these people, my city is pretty boring and a lot of people my age that I run into super care and want you to as well, but I'm not interested in picketing some Jordan Peterson speech or joining some useless anti trump rally (I am in Canada,  I honestly don't think the rally even happened, and if it did nobody cared enough to film it) 

I'm not going to alienate my conservative friends, nor am I going to shun my Liberal friends. Ya, maybe the guy in my area for conservatives is a tit, but they are voting more so for his policies concerning finance and not being a broke country,  the social stuff sort of falls away when your city is shutting down Emergency Rooms because it's broke. I mean yea immigrants are cool and all, but if we can't afford to run our hospitals who am I to judge buddy for voting for a party that he thinks will fix it.

155,"When I was twelve, my parents tried to force me to see a counselor. I was self harming and they were doing all they could to help me. But, I cried and begged and pleaded that I would stop if it meant I didn't have to go to the counselor again. They reluctantly agreed but now, I wish I had gone back. I wish I had gotten help then. Now, I'm twenty-two and still suffering with the same anxiety and depression that I was then. However, it has gotten worse. My temper is shorter, my anxiety is never-ending, and I'm frequently having thoughts of suicide. 

A couple of weeks ago, I hit one of many breaking points. I had a rush of anxiety and fear and depression and anger; I tried to kill myself. My better half fought me for my method, physically restrained me until he could get it from my hands. He saved my life that day but the thoughts haven't stopped. I still can't believe I got to such a low and that I put that responsibility on him. But I still didn't seek help after the incident. 

It wasn't until about a week ago. I started an argument with my partner and I quickly spiraled. I knew the subject of the argument was irrational at the time, I wholeheartedly understood it, but I still lost control. I couldn't keep my anger and frustration and pain at bay anymore, I snapped that night. I broke down, really broke down. After the argument ended and we went to bed, I stayed up sobbing, feeling hopeless. Not about the argument, about my mental state. The thoughts of killing myself were intense and I began to realize that I *desperately* need help if I wanted to continue seeing the light of day.

As it was the middle of the night, I couldn't call a counselor and set up an appointment. Mind you, I've had these realizations in the past and wanted to seek counseling, but by the time I'm able to, I've lost motivation and convinced myself that I can handle it. I didn't want that to happen again. I reached out to someone I knew in high school, who I was pretty sure struggled with mental illness herself. It was a long, rambling, apologetic message about how I really need help but don't know where to start. I *truly* did not want to send it but I knew if I reached out to someone, I would feel accountable for going through with my plea for help. So I sent it on a whim.

She replied back the next day. Full of love, support, advice, and even told me she was proud of me for having the courage to send the message. I really cried. I felt so much stress alleviate from my shoulders because someone understood what I *needed* to hear. I'm grateful I sent that message because by the time she had replied, I had already lost my motivation and decided not to seek counseling (*again*). But when she replied, I felt accountable, like I had hoped that I would. So I did it. I called a counseling center and gave them all my intake information and I'm currently waiting for them to assign a counselor to begin. Really, part of me just wanted someone to be proud of me for something seemingly small, but huge in my mind. And I think she is and that makes me feel a tad better. 

I did something else too. Once I had made it past the point of *just calling* for counseling, I felt hope for myself. I went back to the gym and began setting goals for myself. Not unrealistic or idealistic goals, achievable goals that I want for myself. Improving my mile time from 16:40 to 12:00, for example. In the past, I've set goals like ""Lose 40 pounds"" and when it didn't happen overnight, I would give up. But this goal can be worked towards daily. I've gone to the gym every day for the past three days and I'm excited to go tomorrow and see how much I can improve my mile. This is the best record I've had yet for the gym.

I'm going to be more honest and open too. I've lived very secretively from my loved ones for a while and I'm going to put an end to it. I've already started by telling them that I now ride a motorcycle, something I previously would have hid for a long time. I hide most of my tattoos until it became too hot to hide them. I hid my relationships, my suffering, everything, for as long as I could and I don't want that anymore. 

I'm really excited to get the help I need and to help myself in other ways. I want to stop being the toxic person that I am. I want to be better. I want to love myself.
