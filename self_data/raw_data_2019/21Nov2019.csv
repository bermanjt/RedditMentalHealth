0,"After years of struggling with depression, anxiety, PTSD, I finally reached out to a couple different people to start therapy.

Got things figured out with one therapist near my home who takes my insurance and seems great, all good, right? Well the last step was to call my insurance to receive authorization. Turns out, they won’t authorize or pay for therapy.

So, here I am, feeling more shitty than before, having wasted all day on the phone being given the runaround, in the same shitty place I was before, and not able to get much needed therapy.

Guess it was all just wasted time, wasted energy. Now I get to go to work and pretend to be happy some more. Yay!",21Nov2019,1

10,"I was informed this past weekend when having lunch with an old middle school friend whom I hadn't seen in 17 years. My seventh grade science teacher was arrested about a decade ago for two separate charges - one for having sex with a student, and another for ""soliciting a minor over the internet"" (asking her to have sex over Facebook messages). Both of these were with the same student, an (obviously) unidentified 14 year old girl. 

I have no idea how long he was in prison for, but I do know that he was sentenced to 15 years and is out now on parole. I was able to find him on my state's sex offender website, and it was surreal looking at his mugshot. Everything about this was surreal. You hear about these things happening all the time, but this is the first time (to my knowledge) that I've ever been a student of someone who did it. The worst part is that we (students) used to make jokes about him being a creep - jokes and rumors about him being inappropriate with students. To my knowledge, these were never seriously investigated and were dismissed as just kids making up shit, as kids are wont to do. 

Looking back, I can't help but ponder the possibility of other students being victimized before he was finally caught YEARS after I was in his class. I can't help but wonder how many other teachers and authority figures are victimizing children without getting caught. You see these stories on the news, but it doesn't really sink in until it hits close to home. 

Anyways, I just needed to get this off my chest. It's been weighing pretty heavily on my mind for the last few days. I don't keep in contact with anyone else who would have known him, besides the one person that I had lunch with.",21Nov2019,1
11,"So me and this girl had this summer thing, she lives in norway and I live in sweden so it was kind of a ”long distance relationship” somewhat, everything was great between us, she was also the one who took my virginity if that is worth mentioning. Everything ended with her f*cking my friends cousion (we was never together) but it still kind of f*cked me up... We do still have contact and she regrets what she did alot. I dont want our friendship/what we got to end but I feel like im obssesed and thinking about her all the time. Even when im making out with other people it dosent feel right at all, so people of reddit, how do I stop thinking about her &amp; move forward?

12,"Whenever I tell this story men and women respond differently, why is that? Women say he’s an asshole and men say there’s nothing wrong. Why do you think that is?

My friend keeps objectifying women. Doesn’t matter how old, from a 16 year old to a grandma. I hear him saying under his breath “oh yeah bend over”. Every time someone walks by he’s always checking them out and openly saying how much he wants to fuck their fat ass. He has a baby mama who’s in love with him, random tinder girls and a friend of mine he’s hooking up with. 

My friend he’s hooking up with is 20 and still lives with her parents so she asks to come to my place to drink, not for a hook up. She comes to hang out yet he came over and asked to fuck her in my bathroom. I told him no of course not and told him to fuck her at his place. He said he can’t because he lives with his parents. I’m like why the  FUCK would I let you fuck in my place and you won’t even fuck at your own??!!!

Then he keeps smacking her ass like he owns it. She’s a hook up not his girlfriend he shouldn’t be doing that whenever he wants like he owns it. I get she’s a hook up but she’s also a human being and he shouldn’t expect her to be down to fuck whenever he wants. Like my god have a little respect for her.

Then since I’m cock blocking him he finds some random girl online to fuck and up and leaves. My friend calls him an hour later asking for a ride since I can’t take her home. He ignores every text and call until 1am asking if she still needs a ride. By then she got an Uber. 

When women call him an asshole are they right? Or are men right when they say “there’s nothing wrong and at least he asked”?",21Nov2019,1

24,"I’ve posted here before about the shit friendship I had and ended up losing all of my friends because of it. 

The friend I saw today we were really close. We had been friends since we were kids. We did everything together, told each other almost everything. She got married and we still stayed in touch but then that’s when all the shit went down with my best friend. 

The last time I saw her we had gone out for coffee to catch up because it had been a while with me working 7 days a week and commuting 2 hours each way, for four nights for school. He had already dragged my name through the mud to everyone in our circle but we finally had time to be together. 

The entire conversation was about how I need to apologize. She didn’t even want to listen to what I had to say it was all on me. It was all my fault that he was never there for me, I was only a convenience to him. 

When I saw her today I started to drift towards her, it cheered me up to see her. I was getting ready to say “wow it’s been forever”. But then instantly the pain, anger, frustration, depression that entire circle of friends put my through came back and I just kept on going. 

It makes me sad with how close we were and that asshole of a friend ruined my entire past social life. This afternoon I went through all of the same emotions of seeing an ex I had moved on from but never quite got over. 

He wonders why I wanted nothing to do with him. He tried to apologize for his actions after I finally just fell silent. But it was too late. He hurt me too much.",21Nov2019,1

27,"pls don't immediately write this thread off because of positive traits i am about to i am about to mention about myself.

over the years i've had a lot of girl friends. they come and go because they usually stop talking to me out of nowhere. usually i begin to think the girl and i are friends, and we might meet up for a drink or even go to dinner one on one. sometimes i'll even ask one of them if they want to go run random errands with me or just random shit.

in my mind, we're just going as friends because i genuinely enjoy the company of a girl/ i'm bored and have no one to hang out wth. at some point i may even start talking about other girls with them, and they respond, so that only further assures me that we're just friends.

but this sort of ""friendship"" USUALLY only lasts a short while and they stop talking to me out of nowhere. it took me a while to realize that i'll meet a girl, literally take her out on a date(s) and pretty much reject her. this is a recurring identical scenario with that timeline. that's pretty mean because the girl has no indication that we are friends.

so to answer my own question, no, i don't think they can.

also i am not *fairly* attractive, i'm pretty much super attractive and in great physical shape. i'm confident and outgoing but i'm also naive in this sense. in past relationships it would secretly annoy me if my girlfriend even had 1 or 2 guy friends but i realize that all along i'm just a hypocrite. i used to hate it when girls lead me on in the past but little did i know i do the same exact thing because i guess somewhere in my subconscious i just love that special attention.",21Nov2019,1

30,"Let's clarify that the guy I talk about is also my current crush

In our Drivers Ed Class, we had a project where we planned our own road trip. A prize was to be handed to the best project. I did a simple booklet of everything all by hand since I had no posters but a hell of a lot of art supplies. Everything on there was written and drawn by me with only like 2 stickers. It wasn't as grand and big as his poster but it was something. After the presentations, we(the people who actually did the project)were all to vote on whose was the best. When the paper came around, he told me that he would vote for me because he really liked it. I was shocked because it was nothing compared to his. I was already set on voting for him. I did win the gift card in the end and of course I was happy.

 I hope he realizes how happy he made me.  Anything with prizes, I always never expect to win. I work hard on the thing because I'm dedicated to it. Winning something is a great feeling but I never get my hopes up too high because they will be crushed. So a big thank you to that guy for making my night better then it is☺",21Nov2019,1
31,"This game had a long history of its owners just keeping the game up for the huge amounts of money from its players. It had long stopped acquiring new players and the players it had were slowly quitting (including me) 

The game was eventually acquired by GREE Inc. I’m 100% that they were the ones who acquired it but I’m not able to find anything about it. 

So the game was a strategy game, you played on a world map and you expended from your HQ up to 8 more bases which were named alpha, fox, bravo, Zulu, Romeo, etc. resources were iron and other but the “rare” or just the higher up resources were plutonium and uranium.

My blood boiled. 

I walked over and quietly confronted him. He froze and apologized profusely when he realized my little brother had been standing there.

34,"I started in the 4th grade, filling my pockets with ketchup, barbecue, and pancake syrup packets and would sneak to the boys restrooms. Twisting the packets until they were tight and ready to burst and slide them between the toilet bowl and toilet seat. Boys all over the school would have their parents bringing them clean pants all because they sat down and condiment  packets exploded all over them. I done this all through high school and  still do to this day.

I began planning more evil pranks and started peeing in locked toilet paper dispensers. Ever been stuck in a stall that was out of toilet paper?  Try getting a hand full of urine soaked paper and not having anything but the nasty walls to wipe it off with.  I sit  in the next stall and hold my laughter as I hear a victim cursing in shock not knowing what to do about their misfortune. Having to rush to the sink with urine soaked hands and a itchy unwiped ass. The combo of the condiment  packet bomb and pee paper is a incredibly hilarious experience, well for me it is...  

I  enjoy traveling. gas stations, grocery stores, truck stops. I set my traps. From sneaking a bottle of chocolate syrup  into   
  a fancy restaurant restroom and squirting it all over the toilet and floor,  rubbing icy hot on toilet paper to shitting on the floor of single stall non air conditioned bathrooms on hot summer days forcing men to have to run into the women's bathroom or risk shitting their pants. Even going as far as pouring out  the soap and pouring in sexual lube. It's all worth the torture.

38,"  

From a young age I was attracted to women in every aspect. I admired their beauty, delicacy, and power. Without a doubt, the goal is to *win* the woman over; the decision is hers however. As an adolescent I only had male friends. It was easy to get along, we had similar interests, and I noticed the cool guys that got the girls’ attention were also popular amongst the fellas. I focused on climbing a social ladder to be noticed by women. I found little success for a while. I was always timid, shy, self-conscious, and unconfident. I was a shrimp. 

I moved a lot between the 8th grade and 11th which allowed me to change my character drastically without much repercussion or judgement from peers. I gained interest in sports and aimed to become popular through them. I devoted countless hours to become an above-average athlete and I attained just that by the time Junior year came by. I was the stud of the wrestling team Jr and Sr year. Yet I still could not get the one girl I desired. Before she came in my life, I had a dime at my side. I met her as a Sophomore, she was a Senior. I got kicked out of school for fighting a senior, which I think made me “cool enough” to get her to say yes when I asked her out. To be honest, I didn’t try much to get her attention. The following year I went to a different school, and she started college and I had little interest in maintaining that relationship. Also, I fell in love at first sight with a new girl. 

Picking up where I left off, I tried getting this girl to date me for two and a half years. We flirted, fucked, went out, but her heart belonged to her ex who was out of state for college. I wanted to be her man, get her flowers without shame, spoil her, make her smile. But after two and a half years, I was just about fed up. Not to mention I started college and there was ass left and right. I had asked her out three times by then and told her I would never ask her out again, and we would just be friends from then on. I distanced myself and she noticed. On November 12th, 2013, she asked me out. Deep in my heart I wanted to say NO. But I felt pimp as fuck having a girl ask me out, and after all I wanted this for so long right? Well that relationship was a fucking rollercoaster. We dated for one year and eight months by the time I broke up with her. She lost me one night after we went night swimming. She said she was going to bed, so I followed suit like the fuckboy I was. My brother woke me up at 2am with our cousin on the phone who said he saw my girl with some guy at Dennys on the strip. I laughed and assured him he was mistaken. Then he sent a picture and it was definitely her. He called and said She’s here with \[ex-boyfriend’s name\]. I didn’t even feel a heartbreak. I didn’t feel much of anything actually. Other than slight embarrassment, I was sorta numb. He said You want me to fuck him up? I laughed and said Nah bro, she’s not even worth it. I broke up with her but gave her another chance a week or two later. By that, I mean I accepted a relationship with her again, but I genuinely lost all feelings for her. Things were pretty smooth from there but after a while I realized I wanted something else. I had lust for just about every attractive woman that crossed my path. Thus, I broke up with her and left the state to continue my education in Arizona. I kept talking to her, just staying in touch. When I went home, we fucked and all. She was being loyal as fuck now trying to prove she was worth it and that we could make it work. I was honestly more loyal with us being long distance friends than if we had stayed together. I never cheated on her, and I also never slept with someone else until she said she could no longer do the just friends thing. Once she ghosted me, I broke my shell and started my journey to discover my game. 

I met some chicks that made me feel like sex was pointless and some made me feel like sex was the world. I also came across another broad that made me consider dating her seriously even though I knew deep inside that would also have been a bad trip, so I didn’t. From then on, I decided to give relationships the middle finger for good and have stuck with ‘being just friends’ on my terms. When things start to develop between me and a female, I pull the brakes and demand we be just friends. For some reason women hate that and I end up with control of the relationship. 

I have effectively taken what I always saw in my youth as the woman’s role in the relationship, and it has made me the man I always aspired to be; the guy that’s suave with the chicks and has the relationship his way. I don’t have much desire to change and I don’t necessarily feel guilty for being this way since I am sincere and transparent with my partners. I genuinely love and care for women, but I want to get this lust out my system before I settle. So am I less of a man for taking the woman’s role in the relationship and treating them like this? Am I less of a man for opting out of love and accepting lust with it’s ugliness instead?",21Nov2019,1

47,"When myself, my ex (who I was currently living with in a one-bedroom apartment), and our friend wanted to all move in together a couple months ago, it seemed like a great idea. We were all great friends who all got along together, and I figured having my own space would help me get over the relationship more quickly.

But I was wrong. As I write this, my ex and their wonderful new friend are hanging out in my ex's room by the kitchen, laughing, bonding, watching a movie. I was that friend once. When we first started going out, I was the one cuddling up next to them as we shot the shit and watched a movie together in my basement suite, and we'd make out a little, and it was really wonderful. They were the closest to 'the one' I'd felt up to that point. Six months later they talked excitedly about us getting married the year after.

We broke up at the tail end of January. Things hadn't really been feeling right. We couldn't afford to move out of the apartment so we kept living together for 8 long, messy, wonderful months. We'd have bursts of physical intimacy, and then we'd break away again, and then get back at it. It was a very important summer. I learned a lot.

The summer ended, of course. I've learned more in the two months since we moved than I had the whole summer and, as mentioned, I'd learned a lot that summer already.

Our human instinct for love is possession. We fear that what we love will be taken away, so we grip tighter. And in a weird way, this is both very wrong, and very right. Of course our instinct is correct. We'll die, or move, or fight, and everything we love will go away eventually. But fighting it won't make it change, it'll only make the short time we have with who and what we love worse. We need to accept that these things go away. I need to accept that these things go away. No matter if we died of old age together, or whether we broke up as twentysomethings, won't change the fact that our love was very temporary. The universe will still expand to an infinite nothingness.

I was never allowed to say or do what I really liked, as stupid as it sounds. So many things were pushed on me. It’s just so fucking annoying. My dad doesn’t know the name of the college I go to, I’ve been going there for 3 years. He doesn’t even know how old I am. I remembered yesterday how he used to hit me if I was late to school but it’d take forever for him to wake up and drop me off. He’d start gardening when he knew I had school and then he’d get mad at me. And I’d have to get through the morning in school trying not to cry. And when I was in elementary school, my mom would walk me to school because he liked sleeping in like a selfish asshole. We lived in a small apartment and all my siblings and I had one room and he had his own bedroom, my mom slept with us. So random but whatever. I hate him. God. All those times when I was a kid and my brother got burgers and I’d get the side fries. He’s the one who got a bike and he’d never share. I hate him. I’ve never gotten over it. 

My heart feels so fucking full. I hate my dad. I hate myself. I’m so stupid. I really wish I could go to sleep and never wake up like I’m so done with living. I’m crying in bed and there’s boogers all over my face but it feels really good to cry. It sucks because I know if my mom came in right now she’d yell at me for being sensitive. But I can’t help it. Yes I’m sensitive. Things get to me. My feelings get hurt. I feel like a failure. I’m dumb. I just wanted to do well this semester.",21Nov2019,1
49,"Back in march I designed for myself a sweatshirt and my boyfriend immediately suggested me to start a small business. He's already been going for his dream and building up his own career as a producer for a while, meanwhile I am just a third year university student, who has never done anything exceptional and who has to write down every single cent they monthly spend in order not to go over budget. 

It's hasn't been difficult to literally start since I'm using a platform for beginners but not easy either to be honest - I had to get out my comfort zone, look up financial and law stuff and count up the money I had to invest to open the store -  all things I never did before since even now I'm not as independent and wise as I really wish to be. 
My boyfriend has always been super supportive and boosted me all the summer everytime I slacked off instead of working on this project. I still ask him for opinions everytime I have to do something because I lack so much on self confidence - yet I had (and still have) to contact people directly, doing promotion on social media and sometimes giving out leaflets - I planned to give out 500 leaflets at Lucca Comics (biggest comincon in Italy) but ended up giving out maybe 30 because I'm not able to approach random people in real life, now I stick the rest on the walls at my uni lol

Recently I opened up an Istagram page, though, and yesterday I announced black friday sales! Differently from what I expected, many people already told me they're waiting for it and I cannot feel anything but proud of myself - and also extremely grateful to the person who pushed me to do all of this ♡",21Nov2019,1

53,"I had a normal childhood I think up to when I moved to a new school at 13, anything I said was laughed at. From then I have just got through life not really saying anything to much unless spoken to, I have had no friends, only acquaintances since then. When spoken to, I'm very careful not to make any social missteps I must come across as incredibly boring or cold. 

I know it may be different now I'm an adult, but trying to socialize now terrifies me and I'm scared of making any steps at all, even though it seems ridiculous. I have been to doctors about other physical issues and when they ask is there anything else bothering you, I say I'm very shy and feel I'm missing out on life kind of thing but they say don't be stupid, you look like a well put together guy kind of thing, just life your life, which is probably true, but..

58,"Hello all, just wanted to give a heads up that this will be a post of BDSM sexual nature. I’m sure I may be referred to a different page but I’m precisely looking for the response of general public. 
So here’s the story. I (26F), met a guy online and we started chatting. I’m not looking for anything serious at the moment so I was the one to veer the conversation towards hooking up. I told him the things I liked- being spanked, slapped around, choked etc. 
So he snaps into character and things got more intense. For our night to meet he told me to bring rope, Saran Wrap, and duct tape, and told me what to wear and how to put my hair. 
So I meet this stranger (I know I know, I at least FaceTimed first), who pulls me into his room, gives me a safe word, and within moments I was hog tied, gagged with my mouth taped shut, a belt around my neck and he slapped the shit out of my face (I have a black eye), whipped me with a belt and phone charger to where I’m covered in welts. My cheeks are bleeding from being spanked. He kicked me, sat on me, drug me from the room to the bathroom my a leash around my neck, choked me to the point of passing out and slapped me awake, and more. (We did not have sex/oral). I was there a little over 2 hours. And then I left. 
I never used the safe word. I’ve never had ANYTHING like that happen to me and.. I liked it. I feel so conflicted, like maybe it’s okay to be into “extreme kinks”, but at the same time, if you take it to that extreme, maybe there’s something you should be talking to a therapist about.. Is this normal behavior for someone who has always embraced their sexual realm or is this more concerning behavior? 
So Reddit community, how do you guys feel about this?",21Nov2019,1
59,"Sooo... I'm depressed for quite a while now, with ups and downs. Lately I've been feeling really down, I even started meds 2days ago to help me overcome the waiting time to see a psychologist. I'm also on sick leave now till end of the month 'to get some rest' as my doctor said. 
I don't really want to see other people, leave the house, ask for help...
But there are 2 people I've been trying to get over to my place, those are the only 2 I really want to see/have in my proximity... but I can't seem to get them to come over. And that makes me feel even worse. For me it seems like doing a lot of effort and I don't want to beg.

Just wanted to get this off my chest. Sorry if it's not in the correct subreddit.",21Nov2019,1
60,"If you identify as stargender, pichugender, and all the other otherkin 'genders' (that do not fit the dictionary or scientific/neurological definition of gender) then you should not be calling yourself 'trans'. It just makes us be even harder to take seriously when now when people think of 'trans' they think of people who think they're Pichu from Pokemon or a star in outer space.

Hint: if your 'gender' does not fit in the spectrum of male-female, then it isn't a gender anymore than a tomato is a type of airliner. I really wish the media would stop giving transtrenders the attention and now in the UK people are being taught that if you think you're another species or an inanimate object you're transgender because apparently gender means whatever people want it to mean. It belittles the long struggles people with gender dysphoria go through (spending years to transition to the opposite gender) when you have people who wake up one day and go ''oh I'm vapogender now, I identify as a puff of smoke''.

I find it rather funny how apparently otherkin 'genders' are all 'valid' and make you trans and nobody seems to bat an eyelid, but when I make a counter argument that I identify as a killer whale and I am 'orcagender', people have a problem with it and call me 'transphobic'. Double standards much?

Also if there's now literally infinite genders outside the male-female spectrum then what's going to happen to the LGB in LGBT? Are they going to be irrelevant?

Mainstream media pandering to Tumblr delusions needs to stop. It's hurting trans people, and I have yet to come across an actual trans person who doesn't have a problem with it, yet everyone ignores actual trans people's thoughts on the matter. It's ridiculous, but the Piers Morgan interview that took place recently was refreshing and it's the first time I agreed with everything he said.",21Nov2019,1

66,"I've been going through a pretty serious breast cancer scare this past week. Pretty serious as in ""with these symptoms, if it is cancer it is already late stage inflammatory breast cancer"" (because apparently I have to go the whole hog and get the rare and aggressive kind of cancer) - the five year survival rate for which is... not great. There were lots of tears. 

However I also have a rare pre-existing condition about which very little is known, so just in case it was a strange complication of my illness affecting the nerve clusters in my chest, my doctor mega-boosted my meds for 5 days. If nothing happens, the likelihood is IBC stage 4.

That was Tuesday morning. This morning, my other half affectionately stroked my skin, and the side of his hand caught my breast. Just a very light graze... and I felt it. I jumped out of my skin; I lost sensitivity to light touch a few weeks ago now, and this is the first time I've been able to feel a soft touch since then.

It's the first sign we've had that it's not cancer.  It sucks that my condition is worsening, but it's better than a death sentence. I happy cried 3 times in 90 minutes, and when we (hopefully) get the all clear from the doctor next week, I'm going to marry the crap out of my boyfriend.

68,"It happened on Monday. She was sick but not dying, nobody thought this is going to happen. She was 83 and her heart just failed and she past away.
I'm happy that it was quick and painless, she finally got some rest after years of her health deteriorating. But now everything is sad because my babushka is gone.

It's been a hard year. I ended a long relationship, moved back with my parents and lost two grandmas. I feel like life is an endless series of chores and failures. I cant seem to find the glimpse of happiness and inspiration I used to have. right before she passed away I had a nice morning in which something in the air felt different, I cleand my room and felt productive and cheerfull. For a moment it felt like everything will be alright. And now she's gone and things feel gloom and bad again.

I know that being happy is a choice, that wallowing in sadness dosent lead anywhere, but thia is juat exhausting. I feel sad and miserable, and then I feel guilty about feeling like that, and the I feel miserable because i cant seem to stop. 2020 please be a better year.",21Nov2019,1

I forgot"" and honestly it is so frustrating I've been talking to him for months and he forgets basic facts like this and generally doesn't really care. I should have realized when I noticed that I am the only one initiating conversations.

Am I truly pretty enough to be confident in the fact that I am? Am I actually funny enough to believe so and like that aspect of myself? Obviously, these things are never objective and I know this, and as a result my confidence is usually pretty shot. (I hope this makes sense lol)

72,"16 years of being told I was worthless, a failure, and that I wouldn't ever amount to anything by my mom. 3 years after that of keeping ""her voice"" in my head to berate me. I was traumatized, I admit. When I got out of there, my therapist diagnosed me with an adjustment disorder with anxiety, and identified her and her behaviors as my stressor. She explained to my dad and step mom how to treat me- to avoid further ruining my mental state. She said the anxiety might not go away, that I might have a different anxiety disorder, or PTSD, and that only time would tell. It hasn't gone away. I still have nightmares, I still live in fear of her, in fear of disappointing people. I still live with her voice in my head, telling me every single little thing I've done wrong. I still can't deal with arguments that evolve into yelling, I still can't deal with the little mistakes I make that she blew up over, I still have breakdowns and panic attacks. I still beat myself up. It's been three years. I refuse to let her keep me under her thumb any longer.

I'm 19 years old, and today I'm starting MY life. I'm done with putting myself down, I'm done contemplating suicide to shut my head up. So here's my reminders:

Im not ugly. I'm actually pretty cute, I've got a nice smile, and I'm lucky enough to have never worn braces for it. I've got really pretty straight hair, it's got tons of different colors in it naturally, and I can rock it long or short. My face is cute and smol, my glasses don't dominate my face, they just make my eyes stand out, and make me look cute and nerdy. My eyes are pretty cool too, they aren't the dull drab brown, they are dark and mysterious, honey-brown in the sunlight. My complexion is nice too, not a whole lot of acne going on there besides blackheads and the occasional whitehead. And ya know what? I've got damn good legs too, my arms are nicely toned, my fingernails look great when grown out, my hands are meant for creativity. Long fingers to play flute, to hold a violin bow, to play piano, to play bass, to play guitar, to draw and tons of others things. 

I'm not fat. I've never weighed over 160. I'm 5' 6"" and have a perfectly healthy bmi. My waist to height ratio is in a healthy range too. Wanting to get toned is fine, but I don't need to lose weight right now. Heck, I'm in the best shape of my life right now! I weigh 130, and since I walk everywhere I keep decent muscle mass on my legs.

I'm not stupid, or an idiot, or dumb. I'm pretty damn smart. I got a 1300 on the SAT, first try, no essay, and I hadn't taken calculus yet. I got a 94 on the ASVAB, also no calc. I got a 3 and a 5, a mother fing 5 on my AP english exams. I got into Purdue! Did I get dropped? Yes. My grades are on the upswing this second half (A's and B's!), I've been working, and helping run club events. Speaking of work, my boss (grad student) wants me to head a freaking paper! He believes in my intelligence. I've designed and drawn product concepts, that my engineering friends like. Nobody I've met can read faster than me, and nobody I know was reading at a college level by fourth grade. That takes some smarts. Not to mention, I'm creative as fuck! I know my way around over 10 instruments, my sketching skills are improving greatly-and that's just since this summer! I am talented and intelligent.

I'm not a bad person. I'm beautiful inside and out. I fight for my friends, I'm always there for my family and my boyfriend, I tell the truth, I volunteer for jobs and tasks I don't have to do. My club would've made me full staff if I hadn't been dropped, and that's not an easy feat. I was voted to be a drum major in high school, I've made friends in college, and my family loves me. Hell, even my high school friends still stay in touch. Nobody would do this if I wasn't a good and likable person. 

And here's another thing, people care about me. I have family, friends, a loving boyfriend, and it would crush all of them if I died or disappeared. Besides, who would hold all the club stuff? Lol. 

I am not a disappointment, I am not broken. I am a whole person, with some baggage. I've experienced things nobody should ever have to deal with, I've heard things said to me nobody should ever hear, I've seen things nobody should ever see. While my past does affect me, it doesn't have to be my defining quality. It isn't my defining quality. People see me as strong, and that is how I will be. My ADHD does not mean I'm too weak to concentrate on things or not disciplined enough. I was diagnosed in middle school, but went through the entirety of school without meds. I'm pretty dang disciplined to have done all that. My anxiety issues will be solved. I have an appointment in January, I'm going to start therapy, I'm going to get out on ADHD meds at the least. This does not mean I'm broken, my brain is just a little different, my life has been a little difficult. This doesn't define me, and I refuse to let it. .

Life does not suck. It is good an beautiful and I have a TON to look forward to. I'm going to get back into Purdue. Maybe not this semester, but the next one for sure. I have amazing friends that I want to see and help succeed. I have family, a nephew and two nieces, that I'm going to become rich for to set up college funds for them. I want to see them graduate. I have siblings that I want to see get to their dream jobs. I have a dad and step mom that love and support me, even if they don't always show it. I have a wonderful grandmother who is always prevalent in my life, who loves and depends on me. 

My boyfriend loves me. I deserve him, and while he deserves the best, that is me. We have similar hobbies, but not so much that we don't get alone time. We enjoy spending time together, we're good partners working together, we balance the chores-even though he doesn't live with me. He is sweet and loving to me, a gentleman. He does the dishes and takes out the trash, helps me get groceries or do laundry when I don't have the time. I'm not horrible to him, and I should not leave him because ""he deserves better"". I am sweet to him, I make him food, help him design things, check over his writing, remind him of things, and cuddle him whenever he needs it or wants it (and sometimes when he doesn't). I'm going to make him a promise ring, we've talked of it before, we're going to get married someday, and I'm going to hold our kids. 

He doesn't deserve to have his heart broken, and he hates when I'm down on myself, because none of it is true. 

I'm not ugly, or stupid, or fat. People care about me. I am loved. I am important. I'm going to do great things in this world, that's what everybody has been saying, and they wouldn't say that if they didn't believe it. 

I am beautiful, I am intelligent, I am wanted in this world. My boyfriend does not deserve to have his heart broken, and I deserve to have him in my life. 

I am perfect. My only flaw is my self-hatred, and that stops now. 

Is this cocky? A little. Does it matter? No. I'm fighting my self-deprecation, I'm improving my self-esteem, and if that means coming across as self-centered, than I really don't care. I refuse to be help prisoner in my own cage of hatred for any longer. 

To anybody else struggling with that cruel little voice in their head. It lies. Everybody is important, everybody is beautiful in their own way, everybody has their own unique talents and skills. Keep your chin up, and tell that nasty little voice to shut the f up.",21Nov2019,1
73,"Okay.... So what I have realised is that I have lived 17 years and my life seems so dull.

75,"My whole childhood we had a grandfather clock in hour home. The last 5 or so years we had it it was broken, but I would play with my dolls with it and pretend it was a magic male box that would deliver me letters, or a house for my littlest pet shops. 

When I was 14 or so my mom decided it was time to give it away because it no longer worked and we had no room for it. And for the last 3 years I’d nearly forgotten about it. 

Then a few months ago my boyfriend moved into a new house, and since it was much bigger than his old one they got a bunch of new furniture from the thrift store. One of which was a large grandfather clock. As soon as I saw it, I knew it looked familiar, but I wasn’t sure if it was the same one so after awhile I forgot about it.

Yesterday I showed a picture of it to my mother, and she confirmed it was the same one. Down to the same scratch it had on the bottom. 

The clock was made and bought in Canada, the scratch is in the exact spot and shape my mom described, so it’s definitely the same one. Plus it is now functional.

My guess is someone bought it and got it fixed after we gave it to a thrift store, then 3 years later they also got rid of it.

My grandmother had bought the clock in the 70s when my mother was in high school in Canada . We had it in 6 different houses in the US, 4 of which when I was growing up. And now it sits in my boyfriends living room. 

When we move in together we plan to take the clock with us :)

I’ll try to attach a picture if I can figure out how !!

98,"And I fall for it every time. 

I'm currently on my third time abroad, and it was very exciting in the beginning as I was discovering the new city and meeting tons of new people. After a few months of being here, the honeymoon phase has passed and I feel drained with the constant socializing. I really just want to go home and cuddle with my fiance after a day at work. I haven't told my friends here that I'm actually excited to leave, many of them told me that 4 months is way too short and maybe I should stay longer if I can. I lie and tell them I wish I could, but I have to go home because I have a job and my fiance to come back to. 

As much I don't want to admit it, and despite making all these new friends, I feel a little lonely. I want to go home now.",21Nov2019,1
99,"What we fear the most is what haunts our thoughts the most

Sorrow, loneliness, guilt, dissatisfaction, malevolence, destruction is but a taste of what we fear may transpire

We hide behind masks to shield our fragile state of minds

For those who dread anger, plays the joker
For those who have guilt, plays the philosopher 
For those who control each other plays the tyrant

A terrifying reign
Oh, what I do 
To ease this burning pain

A face of unoriginality that manipulates our every action, thoughts and concerns

Wallowing in the deep into the infinite void, how unexquisitely morbid.

I dread the endless thoughts that course through my pitiful mind into what the future brings forth. 

Life, a curious creation,
What delight
Think not of what may come to be 
But forge a path that was meant for just the grace of me

Doubtful assumptions,
How quaint of you
The smear of excitement as you smile from ear to ear

I despise the things you see for only I can see what truly lies within me
Destiny written in the palm of my hands 
My quake shall be felt like never before across all the land

Your diffidence shall be your unmaking.
Your torment shall be yours alone.
A counterattack awaits you in the shadows of calm, patience and vengeance 

I am a white wraith 
Born from the love of heaven 
I am hell unbound
The taste of sweet revenge
The legacy of my tale, just how renowned? 

What greater weapon is there but to turn your enemy to your cause? 
To use their own knowledge and weapons against them? 

Fight fire with fire
There is no escape
Only one must remain

Who else could it be? 
Foolish child
It way as well be me",21Nov2019,1
101,"I’m a 15 year old girl and have major mental health issues. Last year I overdosed twice and went to the hospital both times and the 2nd time I got sent to a behavioral health hospital and got prescribed anxiety,depression and sleep meds. Once I got out my mom never refilled my meds or got me a therapist. She says no one around us will take my insurance and if they do they are booked and already have enough patients. Recently my grandma was given up to 3 months to live because she has end stage pancreatic cancer that spread to her liver and she is the only person who was there for me when I overdosed and she was the one who came and visited me while my mom didn’t come and see me once. She knows about my bad mental health and she understands me more then anyone because she herself has bad mental health and has anxiety meds and what not. I have begged my mom for help and she says she can’t find anyone or “A pill isn’t gonna fix anything”. I even asked her to send me back to the behavioral health hospital that she sent me to last year and she said she doesn’t have the time. I had a really long conversation with my grandma yesterday about my mom and how she doesn’t understand me or my mindset and she agreed with a lot of things I said. My grandma has been showing a lot of signs that her time is near. Her abdomen is filling with fluid causing her to look super bloated but she said there is no point in starting to get it drained, she gets confused a lot with names and places but then she will be like “I’m sorry idk what I’m saying” and I tell her it’s okay. Her knees are starting to turn purple/blue and she will sleep a lot or not be able to sleep at all. Her breathing has been changing in her sleep and last night I was in the kitchen and heard her breathe in and it was super raspy and loud and my heart dropped and I went into her bedroom and put my hand on her face and asked if she was okay and told her I loved her while my grandpa had his arm wrapped around her waist cuddling her. I know she most likely won’t make it to Christmas or even another 2 weeks. I am extremely depressed and I feel as if my life is turning black and white and all the color is fading away. I have no motivation anymore. I haven’t done school in a month or so. I’ve been thinking about suicide a lot and just taking pills and writing a letter to my grandma. I used to want a future and would study medical terminology and psychology and had a whole notebook for it. Now I don’t care about anything anymore. I don’t care about a future because to be honest I don’t want to live in this society. I wish my family would understand and just let me go because im tired. I’m really tired. I’m tired of fighting everything in my head and trying to act normal and hold everything in until I have a huge breakdown and end up hurting myself again and again. I’ve been thinking about overdosing a lot lately and how if I die then it was meant to be and if i live then I’m meant to have a future. My friend told me to come on here and do this since my mom won’t get me the help I desperately need so I guess here I am.",21Nov2019,1
102,"Ever since I met my girlfriend I've noticed how lonely I really am. Of course I have my girlfriend and she's great, she makes me happy just by existing and I never knew affection like this was possible. The mental abuse from my parents turned me from a confident, happy boy to a sad and lonely one- shutting himself off of any friends he had and making him socially awkward and behave weirdly- I was eventually diagnosed with mild autism.  (and also I don't live with my parents anymore)

For my first two years of high school the only friends I had were online friends. I tried to make friends in school but since my school isn't considered of the highest prestige, those who were potential buddies left. It took all my mental strength to ask someone for their contact info so we can talk to eachother online but they eventually ghosted me. 

I was for a longer period of time, until this summer really, used by an online friend whom I talked to the most. She showed me the *smallest* signs of affection and talked to me *sometimes.* I wanted some sort of love and she was my only source, so the fact that she spent several weeks and months not talking to me and then talking to me a little bit sometimes when she needed me because she was ""Lonely"" (despite being more socially capable than me) drove me crazy. She did say she loved me like I was her brother, but what kind of person gets mad and sad at every instance you like something they don't agree with or ""play their favorite game wrong.""

There were some people in my class for these past two years that have talked to me. One guy who went on walks with me and talked about things with whenever he wasn't with anyone else (literally he preferred being social with anyone else but me.) and one guy who is my self proclaimed ""best buddy"" who hasn't done anything for me, has ADHD, says openly that he ""can kill everyone in this room"" alot, and gets mad at me when he asks me for help and I help and he doesn't understand. Of course from other classes there are some people I talk to who treat me more fairly, only they're not interested in after-school activities with me. Bummer.

My half-brother is the only family member who talks to me anymore at all, but even he only says the occassional obligatory ""How you doin?"" on facebook and replies with ""Haha"" to everything most of the time.

I'd like to note that I'm not depressed in the least, nor do I hate myself and I'm not sad anymore at all. All I can feel is happiness and love for the girlfriend I have and... Hate for everyone who has affected me negatively in my life. All I wanted was some sort of love, or to be able to hang out with people- you know HANGING OUT, after school, like it's second nature and not some special event. To me those sort of things were always stuff that happened in movies. The only ones I could rely on for continuous love abused me mentally so I never had a safe place to rest my heart on, literally anyone who have isolated me can f\*ck off and I know it's terrible, but I almost wish they have terrible lives. 

I read online that people who have autism have a deep interest in something. You could argue that I have a deep interest in anime and video games and Japan, but I almost *don't*. I don't feel like I have autism at all, I've just been forced to engage in these activities as to engage in *something* rather than just lie on my bed and weep all day. If I could choose, I'd travel places or visit family members. On the way back home from school I've even talked to myself and imagined what I'd tell different people. 

People point to overpopulation and say that people who have children are selfish etc. Now that I have a girlfriend, I want kids with her, and she does with me. And considering how lonely I've been for a huge part of my life I don't care. I want to love, until I met my girlfriend I've never been allowed to love, just let me love. Everyone who tells me otherwise can f\*ck right off.  And unlike my parents, my father of which literally told me that I was last on the priority list, even after the dog, I want to make sure these kids never develop insecurities and get all the love and support they need.

... If anyone sees this and wants to comment ""wahh you're so selfish wahh your relationship won't last,"" just eff off, I don't need that.",21Nov2019,1
104,"Years ago I did this with some stray kittens (and mother cat) at a place I worked. I hung out with them a LOT , fed them, made boxes (with holes) for them to play in, made winter shelters for them, etc. etc.. Was great fun. I miss it really.

Anyway I found out when I made a very faint howling wolf sound they would stop, become acutely aware (look around) and freak out and run for cover. 

I'm curious if this was instinct or something they learned. They were outdoor cats living on the edge of a VERY large wooded park so I'm sure they have heard coyotes howling/yipping. 

So... the experiment I want you to do is the same. With your indoor kitten (not too young though). When it is quiet in your home... just make a faint howling sound and try not to let the kitten know it was you doing it. See how they react and tell me what happens.",21Nov2019,1
106,"Hello everyone. I’m an 18 year old male, and I want to stop living like an animal.
My entire life (I know it’s not long) I’ve chosen the easy route. Wether it was not learning life skills, not practicing instruments that I wanted to learn, not studying, not attending school, or basically not doing anything that I wasn’t naturally good at or anything that wasn’t easy to do. 

Probably the worst of it all was me giving into my ... instincts? Desires is probably a better word. I’ve been addicted to pornography and masturbation ever since I discovered them. I’ve also been over weight for a few years now because I wouldn’t do any physical activities, but would eat like someone who was deadlifting. 

I partially blame my learning disability and decent intelligence for my laziness. Usually people with slight learning disabilities like mine can compensate for them by studying more and harder. They get into that mindset shorty after entering elementary school. I however was always smart enough (I know I sound pretentious) to not have to study, which resulted in me becoming lazy and never studying. however, I wasn’t smart enough to do the same in high school (without even mention that I migrated to a new country and had to use a new language).

I hated high school and had a lot of anxiety (diagnosed by a doctor not me. I thought I had depression) about my future and what I was going to do with my life. I over came this anxiety by thinking like this: 
“Nothing matters. The universe is so massive. What is a single planet and race compared to the world? Nothing. There’s no point in trying to become successful since I’m only going to be alive for such a short time anyways”.

I understand now that I was just lying to myself so I would feel better. 

After I finished high school and the source of my problems was gone (I wasn’t bullied in case you were wondering) I began to slowly see the truth behind my lies and I decided to change myself.

I am currently not a student and unemployed. I am writing a fantasy book that’s going pretty well. I really love writing and that’s what I’ve decided to do with my future.
I’ve started losing weight by working out everyday and eating healthier (already seeing results!) and Im trying to quit porn by doing NoFap for 30 days. If 30 doesn’t work I’ll do the proper 90 days.

Summary (or tl;dr? Is that how u write it?): I have chosen the easy route my whole life and lied to myself so I could deal with my anxiety about what I was going to do in the future. Now, I’ve decided to change my life for the better.

 The community here seems nice so I’ll just drop this here",21Nov2019,1

126,"I recently transferred to first shift from second at  a factory I  have been working at for  2  years. On second shift I had a supervisor that was somewhat laid back, as long as you did your job you were fine. Now I have a bitch supervisor that takes her job way too fucking serious. Everything has to be PERFECT. Her way or no  way. Does not  know how to chose her battles. All so she can impress the big wigs and kiss ass to move up. She picks her favorites, and I am not one of them because I have mouthed off to her because she deserves to be put in her place, I told her she needs to get off my back. I don't give respect if respect is not given to me and she fucking HATES me because of it. 

I  am written up at least 2-3 times a  week for the most petty shit. Never was I written up on 2nd besides the time I was late for work. Others who do the EXACT same she turns the cheek to.  And the other co workers laugh as they walk by the desk seeing me sign these write ups and treat me like shit only when she is around.  I am not a lazy worker  but I may forget to do tiny things time to time, she watches me  like a fucking hawk JUST WAITING TO POUNCE ON ME for a mistake. I stare at my feet instead of look at my phone like the others when work is slow, I have to constantly think about  how to perfectly do something so she don't say i'm doing it wrong. If I need help catching something up I need to ""pay better attention to my job"" if others need help she is more than glad to help out and act like their buddy while doing it.

 I love 1st shift  hours much more but I dread coming into work to this Nazi bitch.  She acts like she owns my ass and I am her little red headed step child she can beat around on to show she has power. Cocky and can ""do my job with her eyes closed"".
