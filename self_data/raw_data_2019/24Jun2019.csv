6,"For the very first time in my life I (F/18) asked a classmate if she would like to meet up and do something with me. She told me that she was actually gonna ask me too but didn't have the courage to do so.  


I had been struggling with depressions until one or two years ago but I never had the feeling that I got rid of this fear of approaching people, so when I started my apprenticeship this year I planned to change my attitude completely and change from the shy little girl that never talks to anyone to a more confident girl that likes talking to people and makes friends.   


On the first day of school I was extremely nervous, despite that I already started talking to some people to get to know them and show everyone that I am a person they can easily talk to. Now I get along with everyone in my class and have a few friends I always talk to.  


After I got her response I was sooo overwhelmed by my feelings that I started crying immediately and felt like someone normal and thought ""wow, it was worth fighting all those years, I have come so far"". One year ago I could have never imagined that I would improve like this.  


Thank you for reading my story, I hope I could help someone a little bit.

It's been a hot minute since I posted here last. I figured I would Run an update because I am so happy with myself today and I had no one to share with so here I am. So it's been 4 days since I stopped my addiction. I, in essence, ran out of time to be on it. I already feel a lot better. I know it seems early to be saying this but I feel it. I cut a toxic person from my life. I am pretty much over my ex at this point. I just am happy with myself right now as I am working on getting back to the me that I want to see again. I will take some time but I am on the right path

Hey Reddit.

Im turning 27 this year. Dad was an addict (coke, alcohol, cigarettes) and died around 40.
I lived with him until i was about 4-5, he was arrested and i went to a foster home. My mom came and got me as soon as she could. She was in california saving up by working at a beauty supply store, and i was in ohio.


I started drinking and smoking cigarettes at 17, tried cocaine for the first time at 18. I didn’t have a great relationship with my parents so I moved out at 18. With no supervision, I didn’t go to class and eventually dropped out of community college. Since I had a place of my own, my apartment became the place for all of my friends to hang out so we could drink, smoke weed, and at the time — occasionally do coke (once every couple of months).

I was with a girl at the time — beautiful, sweet and caring, and at a good place in life right now — who would always make me promise to stop smoking weed. Unbeknownst to her, I continued to smoke weed but was really getting into cocaine.

2013, after three and a half years together, she left me for another guy. Took a trip to europe and sent me a goodbye message through kakaotalk (a messaging app). I never told her I did coke, and I don’t think she would be able to tell at the time because we were so young (21) and she didn’t know anyone that did coke. 

I didn’t blame her. I was bouncing from job to job all the time, never spent money on her, would ignore her at times. It should have been a wakeup call for me.

I met another great girl the next year who I was less secretive to. She knew i drank, smoke, did coke. She was 100% sober. Its weird how we can ended up renting a house together but she eventually wised up and broke up with me while we were still living together.

I haven’t been able to keep a job for over year since I’ve started working. I haven’t been able to save a fucking cent since I’ve started working. By the way, I started working at 15 1/2. As soon as i was able to get a worker’s permit.

This past week — i dont know what the hell came over me but i went on a crazy binge. Told work i had a medical problem. Told them I’d bring a doctors note ( i dont have one and im contemplating not even going in tomorrow). This is almost always how i end up leaving jobs. Ill just snap and go on a crazy binge, and then not show up to work.

I’m at rock bottom (nothing new for me at all) — taking care of a DUI, zero money, might be out of a job depending on what i do and what happens tomorrow. Ive been in this position so many fucking times but this time i dont wanna do it. I dont wanna be broke putting back together the pieces of my life, finding another job, etc just to throw it all away again down the line.

To be honest, suicide has been coming to mind lately but i dont have any serious plans on acting on it. The only reason is because I couldnt do that to my mom. All her friends (who have sons that are doing big things now) ask about me from time to time, and all she can do is smile and tell them im doing good.

What i want to do is tell her im addicted to cocaine, and ask if i can stay with her until ive saved some money up and taken care of everything i need to at the moment (dui, debts, etc). Get a new phone number, delete all social media. I want a fresh start. The only things is, ive been telling her im doing good lately and its really going to bring her down.


Thanks for reading, sorry its kinda all over the place. I’d love to talk to you all!",24Jun2019,1
10,"Without music I'm an anxious mess, drifting aimlessly and disintegrating, over and over, losing myself to oblivion on a daily basis. As soon as the music begins, my will calcifies, a holy light enters my blood and illuminates my being. A kinetic forcefield compels me forward and everything is energy. I feel like a god. I used to be wary of my reliance on music but at this point I am so annihilated, so far from the path that I wish I were on, that perhaps to offer myself this short term indulgence is all I can really do to consistently get out of bed.",24Jun2019,1
11,"During the school year I had a crush on this guy that I had 2 classes with. Those classes were taught by cool teachers who didn’t have assigned seating, so I never had the excuse to talk to him. And I’m a shy girl so I couldn’t just walk up and start talking to him. 

I’ve barely said two words to him all year and I ended up just kinda staring at him when I wasn’t doing any work. 

I was crushing p hard and it got to the point where I would go through a plan in my head on how to get an excuse to talk to him. Some would go something like: I hold my backpack unzipped in my hands and act like I’m putting something in, then I bump into him and my stuff spills out and it’s like a movie where he helps me pick everything up and yeah. But I of course never did so. 

It’s all very frustrating and I look back at it and cringe wondering if he thought I was creepy. So rip me.",24Jun2019,2
12,"My dad died nine years ago. I was 14. Our relationship was complicated at best. He was verbally abusive, and my mom threw him out when he lunged at me at age 10. I assumed he did the best he could with what he had. Shortly after he passed, we realized that his estate was given to his sister. She fell off the face of the planet, the same way she did when she coerced my grandmother to do the same. We tried to fight it, but couldn't afford a lawyer. My mom, younger sister and I were left with nothing. My mom cut us off from our older sister from my dad's first marriage, and we did our best to move forward.

&amp;#x200B;

Mom spiraled deeply into her addictions, and her new lifestyle exposed us to dangerous situations and people. My mom befriended someone in our apartment complex who had been fired from my school for sexually harassing the children. I was in fourth grade. He later assaulted me as a teen in the home. She then attached herself to yet another abusive man. He came and went, and that wore on my mom so greatly she tried to kill herself. She couldn't face our small town community after that, so we uprooted and went to this guy's hometown. The toxic environment had me staying with a boyfriend a few years older more frequently than I was home. He, too, assaulted me at a party. A few months later, I blacked out in rage and attacked him back. Never saw him again. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom and this man eventually married during my freshman year of college. She promised she wouldn't until I was done. My financial aid package was so greatly affected that I had to drop out. I didn't live with her when this all transpired, but FAFSA does not consider financial independence without meeting additional criteria (marriage, children, military, etc). I went no contact, and reconnected with my older sister. I worked 60 hours a week until I could reapply for college, then completed my degree while working regular full time hours.

&amp;#x200B;

Life is supposed to be better now. I finished my degree. Have my dream job. I am engaged to the love of my life. But now, nine years later, secrets are coming out. Legal documents and emails are surfacing, showing that my dad's choice to give what he had to his sister was a choice he made maliciously. He never wanted a family, and was angry at my mother for trying to move on. My aunt always maintained a relationship with my older sister's mother, and so started pouring money into this sister. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had to fight so hard to get here. It was so much easier to believe this all happened because dad's sister convinced him to give her everything in a time of weakness when he was terminally ill. It was easier to think that he thought she would do the right thing, and she just wouldn't. I am hurt that my sister has been given and accepting a free ride of life while myself and our younger sister have had to claw our way through every moment of our lives. 

&amp;#x200B;

This knife won't stop twisting. He never wanted me. He never wanted any of us. That wound is seeping into the parts of my life that are good. I'm exhausted. I trust no one. What minimal, positive memories of my childhood I had left are completely gone. I'm planning a wedding that I don't even want anyone to be a part of, since who knows if those people will even be worth having around in 1, 10, 20 years?

&amp;#x200B;

How the hell do people put this kind of betrayal behind them so they can actually live? I don't know what I'm doing right now, but living isn't it.",24Jun2019,7
13,"I am a photographer. I used to enjoy Facebook and Instagram. Recently this year I joined a few photography collaboration groups on Facebook and I felt like I was enjoying it for a time. Until I realized only certain people (models) were recognized and certain photographers were praised. 

Personally. I enjoy critical feedback. If I post a picture, I would hope that someone would point out what I could do better. Nothing. I see people who are completely new to the group get responses.

I do my best to do my part in encouraging and inspiring others. I have a themed photoshoot planned soon and I'm honestly scared and so insecure about myself.

14,"I'm attracted to women but I have weird, visceral recurring sex dreams with men I feel attracted to in the moment, and the memories and ideas are always in my head, whenever I think about this, most of the time. Ever see a commerical with attractive people on the beach or something, and I guess your eyes default to who you're attracted to? I'm attracted to women all the time, but usually I look at the man first in those commericals, or something, I think just because it's more similar to me? 

I dreamt of a naked hard bodied actor, he was laying down, I started oiling him up, then jerked him off, I blew him, it felt visceral in a weird way, I'm constantly sexually attracted to women but don't really feel like that for them, or for men, to be clear, it's just a recurring pattern, this specifically, that isn't part of a larger whole. I also had a fascination with some of the feminine sphere throughout life, envying some aspects of some women's lives. 

I've been a masculine male my entire life and been entirely comfortable with it. I don't feel any differently. I'm alone in life so no one suffers from my confusion. I constantly hate myself for going over the memory of the real seeming dreams and thoughts, they seem to blend together, some people in my head I barely even believe I've never actually seen in real life before, much less their dicks. Those seem to be the focal point of whatever it is, whenever I'm thinking of a thing, of a sexual fantasy with a man, even though I'm hardly attracted to men. I'm not homophobic in the slightest, just don't feel attracted to men personally. I want to make myself stop having and responding to these ideas.",24Jun2019,1
15,"I honestly hate formalities when I meet someone. I'm just myself, I don't do anything extraordinary so people think I'm cool. Sometimes I'm quiet to sense what the other person is like, other times I'm very outgoing! I don't like fake smiles, fake laughs. I like genuine people! I text a lot (not because I'm overly interested, but because I can't think of everything in one text box \*at once\*). I'm affectionate if I like you, I'm polite to not hurt people's feelings. But if I don't like someone, I will be nice, YET keep my distance. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also noticed either people really enjoy being around me, or they just think I'm weird for being myself... When they're just trying to be cool and socially acceptable. When I'm on a date with a guy, I can usually tell if they are putting their ""best face"" on, if that makes sense. And even if they are completely nice, and polite, I CAN TELL IF IT'S NOT GENUINE.

18,"He was so young, he was 16 or 17, he was barely gonna get a job. I liked him, around the same age, I knew him for the longest time. We never got to see eachother often, but I remember going to his apartment league when I was way younger and crying because I didn't want to leave, every single time.

He was a good kid, but I guess he got mixed with some bad crowds because he got fucking shot. I still can't believe it, this cousin who I knew for the longest gets shot. The last time I saw him, he was playing DBZ and I was just on my phone chilling in his room. Barely spoke to him, I now regret that. He was just talking about what to drink and just trying to have an excuse to leave the house. He left and that was the last I ever saw him. 

I got the news 20 or so minutes ago, I haven't cried but I want to. He had so much going for him, and he gets shot like a dog. I can barely process this, it just doesn't feel real at all.

19,"Let me first give more context. I live in a dorm but my parents demand me to take care of her when they’re away from the house so I have to drive to the house sometimes to take care of her. She’s 15 mind you. Although she doesn’t bother me anymore because I set her straight, she still annoys the hell out of me. Everything she does drives me mad. I have to tell her to stop waving her arms back and forth like some retard and she laughs for no reason all the time, especially when she gets hurt or someone insults her. When I lock her in her room for not following instructions she goes ballistic so I give her the iPad and she eventually settles down a bit.

Thankfully she does talk sometimes but she doesn’t say a whole lot. A lot of the time she just repeats the same thing over and over again and I had to trick her into going outside because she doesn’t know any better. I don’t usually hear much but banging, but not super heavy banging so I’m not really worried about it.

Now here’s the worst part. She barely listens to me when I ask or tell her something and it’s really starting to irk me now. She’ll say “ok” sometimes but not follow what I tell her, and she doesn’t even make eye contact. I’m in awe of how disrespectful she can be like that. I know she’s autistic but she can’t even try showing some respect? Fuck that. I’m tired of her existing and I don’t know what to do anymore.",24Jun2019,0
20,"I begin to be genuinely very tired of this situation, and in general a bit of everything. I really need some advices. 

I'm enrolled in the first year of university, at 23 years old, after having already given up two courses once I reached the second year (the first for reasons I'm about to explain, the second for purely technical reasons, because I had to move out).

I have had neither a happy childhood nor an easy adolescence; I arrived at adult life with difficulty, and only thanks to psychological support and a great deal of ""good luck in bad luck"". I have a psychological evaluation long as a short book, and among the various diagnoses there are a rather serious post-traumatic stress disorder, which leads to a persistent depression, and a borderline personality disorder; I don't even talk about all the other various linked issues, because another hour of writing would not be enough. For economic reasons I had to stop the psychological therapy and apparently I can't take meds, because in one year of taking them, I tried twice to commit suicide with them. 

In short, my country recognizes neither one nor the other disorder as ""disability"", and therefore considers me perfectly capable of studying and working. Sadly that isn't true, and anyone suffering from one of these two disorders knows very well how tiring, exhausting even breathing can be, let alone successfully do things. The depression, then, can be so hard that there are days when I can barely open my eyes in the morning, and little else for the rest of the day.

Studying with PTSD is such a suffering that I consider it almost masochistic. My concentration is almost non existent, I'm forced to read and reread a single sentence three times to understand its meaning, and it isn't even always possible to do so. Memory is also missing for everyday things, making it difficult to even answer questions like ""what did you do yesterday?"" or ""when did you go shopping last time?"", let alone remember historical events or other data to be reported during the tests. At the time of my first enrolling I had already reluctantly renounced studying Law, my dream since I can remember. I opted instead for a degree in Foreign Languages, considering it simpler and more feasible as a more practical and less ""mnemonic"" subject... man, if I was wrong. I find myself, at four in the morning, staring at the same page for forty minutes, with a mixture of desire to cry and throw myself out of the window, unable to maintain concentration for more than twenty seconds on a sentence, without even remembering the topic of the text, without knowing what I'm studying or why, or even just what the subject of the sentence just ended was. 

I don't want to give up university, I don't want to give it up either to my illnesses or to the causes (which have names and surnames) from which they derive. Even if I definitely wanted to put a point to my unsuccessful studies, I can't find a job —that I need anyway, not having a family who can support me and depending, with my enormous embarrassment and humiliation, on other people besides that little, very little, money that I can scrape together helping kids with their homeworks here and there during the school year.

In short, I don't expect from you the magic formula to solve all my problems... but the aforementioned disorders unfortunately also lead to a persistent and rather intense mental confusion, that fills your head like a fog from which you can't get out; I therefore hope that there is some suggestion, some ideas, in short something that even if I could know it, I have not yet managed to see, and that maybe someone else can tell me more easily.",24Jun2019,0
21,"Hello. I’m sorry for the big rambling mess below. I just needed to tell this to someone, and maybe hear some nice words of support or how you might relate to this. 

I am defending my dissertation on Tuesday. I’ve been in graduate school for seven years (first two years was a terminal masters degree). I went straight from undergrad so I’ve been a student for a very long time. I don’t want to be too specific, but my PhD program is in Hawaii, where I lived for four years. This past year, however, I have been living on the east coast for my residency, so today I had to travel 17 hours back to Hawaii in order to defend this week. I just finally got to my hotel and I’m completely exhausted. I probably could have stayed for free with a younger student from my program but I knew I would want to be alone during this process. Though, I feel a little too alone sometimes because I am here without my husband or any of my very close friends as they have also moved off island by now. My husband didn’t come because of costs and his work. I didn’t want him to spend so much on a flight because this trip back is already very expensive. He said he was going to surprise me but ultimately decided not to after I said something about it. It was really sweet of him to think about it. Defending and finishing this degree is such a monumental moment and I feel a little sad the people I love most aren’t here with me. But I know it is better for me to be alone through this because I have been so unbelievably neurotic with stress lately. In addition to finishing my dissertation this month and preparing for the defense, we are also moving to another state for my postdoc at the end of June, so I have been trying to pack all week while my mind is in a million other places and I also feel super guilty that my husband has to do most of the major packing while I’m here even though he says he understands of course. It’s just been a lot. I have been randomly crying at the smallest things and getting so irritable at everyone lately. I am trying to enjoy these last milestones but I’ve been having trouble living in the moment. I still have a decent amount of prep to do before the defense on Tuesday - I’m too exhausted to do it tonight so it will get done tomorrow one way or another. When I finally got settled in my room I got some sushi and junk food and now I’m watching mindless hotel tv. I might take a bath. I’ve been having a lot of trouble sleeping this month, even though I’m exhausted. I’ll wake up after about an hour and can’t turn my mind off. 

I have been thinking about how I should take care of myself after my defense on Tuesday. I don’t foresee my committee failing me but I know it will be very stressful and I will probably cry and have a little meltdown afterwards just from trying to keep my composure while they grill me and also because it’s finally over. I probably won’t have anyone there to celebrate with in the moment (except my chair and committee but we aren’t close beyond a professional level), but that’s ok. I know this is silly, but for most grad programs here in Hawaii, your friends and even your family are usually waiting outside and will give you a bunch of flower leis after you pass. I’ve been there with leis for a few of my friends who defended in the years before me and it makes for such a nice moment and picture. I hope my chair remembers to bring a lei for me but otherwise I don’t think I’ll have that moment. I would feel weird asking anyone else that’s still here to do that since I’m just not close with the remaining younger students in the program. 

But I think afterwards, I will go back to my hotel and I will order a delicious dinner to my room, like fettuccini Alfredo and/or an entire Cinnabon, and maybe I’ll get a nice haircut at the fancy salon next door since I haven’t had one in 6 months. Other suggestions? 

Anyway, thanks for reading if you made it this far.",24Jun2019,1

I can’t shake the feeling that I failed. I know that I didn’t fail my professors or my immigrant family, even though it feels like it. However, I know for sure that I failed myself from two years ago, who started on this path expecting nothing but perfection.

31," So the post part of this is simple, I've found that every couple days I've needed a sorta social detox. By this I mean that I feel like I need to just get away from the people I know and interact with daily. I've never had this issue before until recently, a few months ago. A lot of my social interaction happens online right now since I currently dont have a job or anything to do outside besides occasional errands. Luckily I live with my family but even then I don't talk to them much. I'm not too sure if I'm exactly introverted since I didn't have issues socially when I was working but I don't feel a genuine connection to people. I would say the way I interact with people is just me repeating what I see. Going back to why I do a whole social detox, I feel like no one cares about me, I feel a major disconnect from the people I call friends. Last month I did this around this time, I was feeling suicidal though, I managed to pull myself together since. Honestly I feel like I've done a lot of self discovering in the last few months but I have no idea how to change it. 

So for the question part. I have a few questions that i want to ask. Does anyone feel this way about needing to detach themselves from others and take a break socially? How do you change the way you feel about people? Should I consider finding new friends? Are these issues all caused by me, the people i interact with or a combination?

Lastly i want to wrap this up by thanking anyone who does read this and give some input, it helps learning from others. I'm in the process of seeking professional help but for now this is my best bet. Thank you.",24Jun2019,1

My best friend from my old high school, whom I'm still very close with, invited myself and many other high school friends to an office party last week. My ex from high school that I had dated when I was 15-16 and lost my virginity to (on Valentine's Day no less, we were very romantic for a pair of 16 year olds I guess!) was there. I'm decently sure he has a girlfriend, and even if he didn't I wouldn't pursue him at the moment. But it was such a beautiful energy between the two of us that I'm grateful to have. We talked passionately and got drinks together for hours, realising we probably have more in common now than we did when we dated. I hadn't properly spoken to him in years.

The exact moment I'm thinking of though was when a server gave him a small appetizer that had cilantro on the top. I *hate* cilantro (I have *the* gene, haha), and of course he knows this from the many times we ate together. I had forgotten how well we know each other. If I'm being brutally honest, I was going through an incredibly difficult time when we dated, and if I'm being even *more* brutally honest, I went through an incredibly difficult time much of my childhood and teen years. As such, I have *many* gaps in my memory of those years. I tend to think of them as much more awful than they were (which is probably saying something, because they were pretty awful. It's much better now, ahah!).

He gave me some to try and I made a face at it, ""Is that cilantro?"" I asked, looking back up at him. He rolled his eyes and laughed. I was confused at first as to his reaction and how he knew. But then I remembered *us,* and how well we had known each other. Both of us opened our mouths to say something but we ended up just sharing a knowing look. It was like some shit out of a movie (again, not in a romantic way, just a warmly nostalgic way). It sounds silly and overly simple, and it is. And I loved it.

It was nice to get a glimpse into those years and know that they weren't as terrible as I sometimes have a tendency to remember my past. That actually, when all was said and done, it was really lovely a lot of the time. And it proved to me that, when all is said and done, life has a funny way of working out and being joyful and warm and sweet again, even when you're convinced that something, someone, or some time, is completely ended. Nothing real is ever ended, it just changes shape.",24Jun2019,50

I've seen bad things before and I have always been able to deal with them but the slow death of someone that I care about is crushing me. I am in the passenger seat of the slowest car crash, trapped in a twisted piece of metal careening haphazardly towards a horrible end. I am utterly powerless to help her in any meaningful way. It takes everything I have to just to provide for our physical needs. I try so hard to keep my mind together, to be focused, to let go of the things outside of my limited sphere of control. I've slowly lost everything I care about, while caring for the one person I know I will lose forever. It feels like a death by a thousand cuts, a million small concessions, a one-sided deal with death, a compromise to no one, that the things I give up will be enough to somehow make things okay. I want to feel like, if I can roll with these punches I can call this anything other than a beatdown, or that I will feel any less broken at the end.

40,"Long post warning. No TL;DR.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi, first time poster here. Let me preface this by saying that my parents are divorced and I live with my mom, but I'm closer to my dad's side of the family. I also struggle with communicating with my mom as she's mostly brushed me off throughout my life. Also, she's kind of scary lol. I was thinking I should post this in r/relationship_advice but I don't really want advice, I just want to vent. So... here I am. Please redirect me to another sub if you think I'm in the wrong place, thanks.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm in a family WhatsApp group chat for my dad's side and recently they've been planning a road trip as some of my uncles and aunts are coming to visit. This road trip is around one week long, with 3 or 4 locations, at the end of July. My dad had invited me, and I really wanted to go because the activities sounded exciting. There was fishing, snorkelling, scuba diving and just sightseeing in general. Of course, since I live with my mom, I had to ask her so I did. She said no because my uncle (her brother) was getting married.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, fair enough. However, it's only during the beginning of the trip so my dad said we could skip the first place and he would be willing to drive me out to the next location, so again I ask my mom. I was trying to explain my dad's idea when my mom interrupts me, asking why I want to go on this trip anyway in a snarky (but also kind of... hurt?) voice. As I'm trying to gather my thoughts and explain, she interrupts again and says she was thinking about taking me to Australia to visit my brother, who's studying there.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point it just sounds like she's trying to come up with excuses to not let me go on this trip. Thing is, my brother and I haven't been on the best terms. When I was younger, whenever I annoyed him he would twist my arm, which as a young &amp; dumb 5 year old, hurt a lot. Also, we're 8 years apart and we both like to lock ourselves in our rooms, so we've never had much of a connection nor an opportunity to try, anyway. My mom knows this. She's seen how we act around each other. We've grown to tolerate each other but bringing me to visit him will not be a very enjoyable trip. She may want to visit him but I don't, and letting me go on the road trip while she visits my brother sounds like the most logical and enjoyable way to spend the week for everyone. At least in my mind, anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, because of the hurt I sensed in her voice, I think she thinks I like my dad more than her as she believes I am spending more time with him. This isn't exactly true but it is true that when I'm with my dad, I'm more engaged in activities, and I don't look at my phone much. However, I prefer my dad's company because he's more gentle, kind and forgiving whereas my mom is cold and strict. Also, my dad is the person who has taught me 90% of what I know now. My mom has told me she'll teach me how to cook but after 2 months of nothing, I just taught myself. I genuinely feel like my dad has dedicated more time to taking care of me and is an overall better parent than my mom, which makes me feel like an asshole but whatever. My mom is alright I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway going back to the situation, this was about a week ago and knowing my mom, trying to ask again will end in failure—she's a very stubborn person. So now not only is my summer holiday going to be boring but I also won't be able to see my uncles, aunts and cousins who I haven't seen in literal years. My dad did say that they're all going out to have dinner on the 25th, though, so there's still hope. My sister's going to the dinner too, I believe, so I should be good to go. It still kind of hurts that she would rather I spend a week doing jack shit in Australia just so I can spend time with her instead of actually enjoying myself on a road trip though.

&amp;#x200B;

41,"I'm one of the people who stuggles to hold down conversations online, due to my lack of personality and conversational skills. It also seemed to be when I was on a course of anti psychotics that I forgot how to speak online. While I'm not the only person at my work, there's kind of two groups that seemed to be established before I got there which I still don't feel a part of even after a year. That's my fault for shutting myself away when I first got this job for fear of people finding out my life from 16 to 24 was just taking drugs, I'd class myself as an ex junkie. I deleted Facebook a few years ago to help with my self confidence, and it worked, but now I'm an outsider with no one to talk to. When people see that my account is only a month old, they get suspicious like you have to keep your original Fb account no matter how many bad memories it's full of. I have a few friends outside of work, but it's becoming hard to hang around with them. I'm always the one who travels but when it's an hour and half travel there after work when I finish work at about 10pm, 50 minute travel home after that to get sleep for work the next day,generally starting between 10am-12pm, it becomes a struggle. If I don't contact them, I hear nothing. I've been single for about 7 years, dry spells lasted that long too. The last hug I got was about a year ago. Before that, I couldn't tell you when I got hugged. The only compliment I get is ""you're a great worker Russianbot212"" and that's all good, until you realise people only appreciate how I'm constantly overworking myself for the lowest minimum wage. I really just feel like a piece of machinery rather that a person anyone in my life would want to know. I've tried going out to bars and clubs, but it's weird when you can't dance and are just sat at a table by yourself. I don't have anyone to speak to about all this so I thought I'd post it here. I'm just lonely, and I'm trying to change that yet nothing is working so far but I'm going to keep trying. Maybe one day, I'll learn to be happy and I'll have friends who make it even slightly obvious that they care about me. I hope so, because while I've learnt to look after myself physically, I still see no value in my self mentally.",24Jun2019,1
42,"I’ve been friends with the same friend group my entire life and i’ve kind of always been the one that brought everyone together. my best friend that i met in preschool and  did absolutely everything together my entire life but in the past year we’ve drifted apart. he’s become extremely bipolar to me and gangs up on me with the rest of the group. 

another friend i met in kindergarten has always been close to me but he and my best friend became close and kind of shut me out. 

another friend that i’ve been close with since first grade has blocked me and refuses to be in the same room as me. 

everyone in the group always talks about me like i’m terrible at everything and nobody likes me in general, and makes fun of me. i have a sense of humor with them that kind of has no chill,  like we like to tease each other about small things, but that’s how it’s always been for all of us so i’m no different. at the beginning of the year i tried to change that because it was getting toxic so i decided to stop that humor with myself and see if others would. they kept doing it to me. halfway through the year i gave up

everyone thinks of my best friend as the nicest guy, but he’s such a dick to me half the time. if i ever talk about it to someone they’ll say wtf no he’s so nice it’s because you’re a dick to him. no matter what i do everyone turns against me

the friend that blocked me showed up on the last day of school and just randomly said “the thing i’m looking forward to most this summer is not seeing [me]. he’s been a jerk to me for a while and always acted like he’s too good and cool for me, so this finally made me kind of lose control. i made mean jokes about him all lunch just out of anger, and everyone was laughing but him. i shouldn’t really have done that, but i’d been holding it in too long. 

he blocked me right after that which i kind of saw coming, but it’s been 2 months and he still won’t even be in the same room as me. i talked to my old best friend about it, and he got super mad and talked about how not one person was laughing that lunch and i just kept going  and how i’ve been bullying him all year. that’s not at all true, and this is another thing that he does. he lies about me to others all the time. but apparently he and the guy who’s blocked me have been telling people how much of a jerk i’ve been to them. then when i see my old best friend in person he’s like oh yeah _____ is overreacting lol it was nothing. 

i don’t understand how he can be so bipolar, talk shit about me so much, then act normal to my face 

i don’t really know what to do now because i’ve always been with this friend group since preschool (i’m in grade 10) and i cant just leave. if i talk to anyone they won’t believe me because of the lies they tell about me and if i talk to a friend they’ll say i’m wrong, overreacting, and that i’m the one who’s been a dick 

i even apologized to the one who blocked me after a month and a half and he just acted like i didn’t matter and told me i was being ignorant



sorry if that was confusing lol it just feels really good to get this out",24Jun2019,1
43,"TW; death, car accident 




I lost my brother when I was 6, and he was 9. I remember the accident, and I remember seeing his body with his blood on the road. This image haunts me, and I’ve never received mental treatment for it. This has caused me to disassociate throughout my younger years, as well as extreme depression, survivors guilt, and anxiety. Most of those feelings have somewhat subsided now, but I have a deep fear of losing people I love. I used to fear death for myself, but not so much anymore. I’m just afraid of someone I know dying. I’ve lost sleep over this obsessive fear. Death is inevitable for everyone, I know. But I don’t want to feel that pain of losing someone again. I forget what my brother sounded like, and most memories of him alive have faded. Unfortunately, the most vivid memory I have of him is his life fading away in front of me. I am sure I need therapy, and maybe that’s all I need. But I just want this fear to go away. I want to believe everyone I know is safe from harm.",24Jun2019,2

We all need support. Every kind of support makes us stronger.

&amp;#x200B;

Support helps us believe ourselves more.

Support helps us take a step forward.

Support forces us to take action.

Support makes us feel precious.

Support gives us the courage we need.

&amp;#x200B;

Think of the times that one more report, one more customer, one more vote, one more of something has changed your life. If you haven't  had such an experience, think of, if you had had that chance in the crucial period of your lifetime. 

Sometimes a little bit more support and a little bit more believe in ourselves changes everything, it can help you pass over your competitors and grab the success.

&amp;#x200B;

Award winners always give a speech to the audience and they all thank to someone or a group of people who helped them, who worked with them or who inspired them, but most of all, they generally thank to people who supported and believed in them.

&amp;#x200B;

Social suppport is one of the key factors of unleashing your belief in yourself and your mind power. Each time you are supported your subconscious mind believes more and more that you can succeed. When you have the complete belief to success what will be left to do? To succeed. 

&amp;#x200B;

 

The role of social support cannot be underestimated in any part of our lives. One shot per round of golf! What if you had that chance in any of your life steps, wouldn't that could have changed too much?

What we get here is that social support gives us the belief that we can do it, that belief helps us to programme our subconscious mind to success.

&amp;#x200B;

Examine your social network, is it supportive or not? May be you need to change something about it. There is no way to change your family but if they are not supportive maybe you can limit that or increase their supportiveness. When it comes to friends, you may think of changing them if they are always putting boundaries in front of you.

You should always prefer supportive environments to get the best of yourself and your mind power.",24Jun2019,4

So I went back to school to earn my master's. I was working and studying full-time. I graduated with honors and passed the licensure exam for my field.

49,"So I’ve been wanting a pet forever cause I feel like it will most definitely improve my life, I have extreme depression and anxiety. Due to a $300 non refundable pet deposit plus an $25 additional rent, my bf said no unless I come up with the money myself (he pays for literally everything, I’m a homemaker).  I recently found out that I could perhaps qualify for an ESA. I found one that’s just $50 and they go up to at most for about $150. I would do it “the proper way,” which is go to a therapist myself and get the letter but my insurance is crap, this is legitimately so much cheaper. 

However it seems as though he is still going to make it to where I have to come up with the $50 myself, makes sense since this is something I want and he does not.

- Crossing off items from my bucket list
- Talking about motivational/inspirational topics to encourage others doing the same
- helping in real life some selected individuals to reach a goal/dream

I already released videos about the 2 first points and I am working on 2 projects for others:
- Found a recording studio in London to help a gifted piano player, putting his video on YouTube, to get his first album out!
- helping the wife of a friend to start her dream flower business without her knowing (work in process)

I want to work on more projects like this and make it my brand, my niche!

53,"I am 22 and I just had one ""serious"" relationship in my life that lasted about 3 months in 2014. We are very good friends now, we broke up very peacefully and kept in touch. Then I had some random experiences, nothing serious that actually left me anything, just enjoying life, you know. But the more I look around me and the more I see couples getting together and then either breaking up short after swearing each other eternal love or staying together in a ruinous relationship, toxic for them and who is around them. It is just so rare to find a couple with a well balanced relationship and honestly I am happy for them. 

\[Disclaimer: I am not narcissist or vain at all, it took me quite some time to recognize my value and even now that I am aware of it, I stay humble because I see no point in bragging. Here I am just trying to give you a full picture of myself with some random facts, nothing more.\]

The matter is, even if I am just 22 I have had different experiences in my life and my emotional intelligence is so much more developed than the average people I meet. I am extremely empathic and I feel other people's emotions in my own body, sometimes I cry if the other person's feeling are strong enough, even without them saying a single word. I always try to help who's in difficulty when I can because I am aware in the end we are just one thing altogether, just different manifestations of the same energy. I am happy just when the people around me are happy too, otherwise I feel something's wrong and try to see what it is and if I can solve it. I like to surround myself with people that can spiritually enrich me and I really can't stand drama. I value and accept myself for who I am and I take care of me, sometimes I feel the need to stay alone and take some time for myself, too see what is going on inside my head. I like reading late at night and spending hours in art galleries alone, getting lost in the artwork. I speak 5 languages and by now I already spent 5 years living out of home, 3 of which in different foreign countries. So I learned to take care of myself, I know what I need and what I don't, I am so very much at ease with myself. I have no anger, no regrets, no hate inside of me, I learned to let all go and I feel in peace with myself and the rest of the world. I always try to be propositive and positive, yet being conscious that one must first be able to feel its own feelings in order to accept them and let them go. Moreover, I can also cook pretty good, so I am livin' la vida loca with myself as I am my best buddy. Of course I have friends, but I think it is important to always be there for yourself, no matter what you gotta be the one that loves you the most. 

Getting to the point, I feel like the more I take care of myself and the more the distance between me and the others grows, from a possible relationship point of view. I would like to find a person to grow up with, not just to grow up - I don't want an XXL kid as a partner. But I just see shallow people around me, with no ideals and no curiosity, that don't really care for anything except themselves, or simply kind souls that are just too troubled with past issues to have a healthy relationship. I am good on my own, but I would like to find someone that could walk by my side and enjoy the sunbeams with me, someone to share my happiness with. 

Then I see all these shallow and vain people getting engaged so questionably but so happy together for a little while at least... 

Sometimes I just wish I was dumb.

54,"**TL;DR at the end.**

I (19m) have a pair of friends, jane and josh. Up until a few weeks ago, they were dating (1.5 years). They were my best friends,and from the outside, their relationship looked perfect. I had always had a bit of a crush on jane, but since they were together, it was easy to ignore it.

&amp;#x200B;

One day, Josh got fed up with me, called me some names over text, and cut me off. Not long after, Jane broke up with him. She opened up to me, explaining that Josh had been verbally abusing her and threatening to hit her. She told me that he had been talking shit about me behind my back the whole time. That same night, Josh calls me, drunk, crying, and profusely apologizing. I'm in AA, so I directed him to meetings and have been supporting his recovery. I'm his only friend, really. But now, when I think of the things he said to her, and about me, I get pissed. I want to hurt him. But I know what he's feeling. He wants her back but clearly does not understand that she needs time to recover, he thinks 3 months is enough time, she thinks at least a year before she even considers going on a single date.

&amp;#x200B;

After the breakup, Jane and I started spending time together, which we had never done without Josh around. I feel relaxed around her, she's seen me at my worst and my best, there's no judgement. I've been with a good number of women, all of which were wildly wrong for me. I've learned almost exactly what I want from those experiences, and Jane fits that perfectly. Right when we were getting closer, I left for a 6 week road trip. I'm on day 6 and we text constantly, and at night we often talk on the phone for 3+ hours. She occupies most of my mind, especially while I'm parked at some beautiful campsite at night.

&amp;#x200B;

But she needs time, and while my logical side understands and accepts this, the emotional side yearns to tell her about my feelings. It's torture, holding in my feelings, but I know that if I even have a shot with her, telling her any time soon will ruin my chances and possibly our friendship. I can't lose our friendship. I'm just having trouble putting my feelings aside for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Two best friends broke up, guy was abusive and an addict. I resent him and empathize with him, and develop strong feelings for his ex girlfriend.

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on.",24Jun2019,1
59,"I was going through an all time low. My acne kicking into overdrive, spending hundreds on new products to try and slow it, buying the strongest prescriptions I could get from the doctors. 

My self  confidence about my weight kicking me down whenever I started to feel the slightest bit happy. I hated myself so much I didn't know what to do.

 I lost 10kg, it still didn't feel like enough. I became so entangled in the way I looked and I hated it so much. Everything about myself wasn't good enough. I started going out more, drinking with mates, getting stoned and just got to a point where I didn't really care. I don't know what happened, I didn't feel happy nor sad I just stopped giving a shit. 

Fast forward, I met a girl, she was absolutely stunning, obviously my first thoughts were, I got zerrrooo chance and so I didn't bother, but I guess along the way, it helped. It made me more casual around her, i wasn't concerned whether I would get to have sex or form some sort of relationship so I didn't have to tip toe around words. She started messaging me, a lot. We started face timing almost everyday. Usually falling asleep on call to each other. Fast forward she asks me out and I'm in shock. This woman is way too good for me. Like what the fuck. Everything is going absolutely perfect.

Really just gave  me a boot to the head, all I had to do was be kind, be there for her and support her when she needed it and it didn't go unnoticed. Looks aren't everything.

I just broke down crying inconsolably in front of my partner who’s now really worried about me.

[Finding happiness](https://i.redd.it/cw3a8vvs6b631.jpg)

Happiness is the purpose of our lives in many people’s perception yet finding happiness at work is getting harder as the challenges people need to face are rising sky high whether it is the job, that demands frequent change in the employee or the environment at the workplace. What should you do to find more happiness at work?

Here, I will teach you how to become happier and become active at work more than ever in less than 21 days.

There are 7 main actionable ways through which you could develop your happiness at the workplace and let’s dive into the details of each one.

If you find these tips helpful and applicable in your daily life, do share it on the social site you are most comfortable with. Just click the button on the left side of the screen so that we can together, change more people’s lives.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Morning Routine:**

The most important process yet not directly related to happiness at work is having a perfect morning ritual that will set the tone for the rest of the day.

By having a [perfect morning ritual](https://www.happilysuccessful.com/a-guide-to-a-perfect-morning-ritual/;), not only will you be happier but more productive and focused too.

Thus, it is an absolute essential to have a perfect morning ritual in finding happiness at work. Learn here the full guide of setting a perfect morning ritual.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Personal goal:**

Setting and achieving personal goals keep you looking forward to new accomplishments and rewards which intrigues you to work more passionately ultimately making you feel happier in the work environment.

Without a personal goal, sorry to say, but your big human brain is a waste. Even small animals can make a living for themselves.

If you are really looking towards finding happiness at work, I urge you to [set goals](https://www.happilysuccessful.com/the-secret-to-achieve-success/;) and look forward to achieving them from now on. After all, progressing is what makes us happy.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Treat everyone equally:**

Treating everyone equally irrespective of skin, religion, gender, background, and caste is immensely important in the process of being happy.

It’s really that simple. I called this a reciprocal process. The way you treat others has a psychological reaction to your own brain.

If you discriminate a person by his or appearance, body, wealth or any other aspects at workplace; you are likely to feel unhappy when you see a better appearance, body or wealthier person too because when you discriminate others due to the appearance, body or wealth, it defines that you have a wrong perception or insecurities about better appearance, body or wealth is higher than others.

Thus, treating everyone equal will reduce your insecurities, improve your self-confidence thereby ultimately helping you in finding happiness at the workplace. [Click here to find more.](https://www.happilysuccessful.com/finding-happiness-at-work-in-21-days-7-actionable-tips/)",24Jun2019,1
63," Im a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way but she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly but I took it as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She had sent me the other side of a city with a letter one day and I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else and told her if an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself. 

Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",24Jun2019,0
65,"So I’m only 25, but I used to be super rainbow sunshine I love everyone, giving them my undivided trust and friendship. Now I feel like I’ve been burned by close friends, and just people in general, and now I just don’t feel as welcoming and loving. I’ll interact with strangers at a concert, in fact I prefer to interact with strangers because I know I won’t see them again. But making friends on the other hand, I’m just so much more skeptical of making those connections anymore. I have my group of friends that I like, and that’s all I really want. 

I feel bad, because I know a lot of good people who would like to be better friends, I just don’t care that much anymore. I’m sad that I can’t give my undivided trust and friendship anymore, and I’m sad I feel this way.",24Jun2019,11

Philosophical statements puzzled me and hated thinking deeply because I didn’t get to read books anymore. 

Yesterday I just finished a book in one day called I’ll Be Right There by Shin Kyung-sook. It felt so good to finish reading a novel again. I got intimidated at first but I got engrossed in the story that I forgot the time and finished it by 11:30pm. I was so happy!

76,"I cant talk about this irl so I just wanted to tell *anyone* that would listen because I’m really happy. 

I’m in a friend group of 3 girls. The other 2 are close and have been for a while, and while I’ve never gotten any indication whatsoever that they didn’t like me or anything, I was always worried that I’d never be able to get as close to them as they are to each other. But last night we were all laughing about how we each had clothes of one another to give back, the one girl said “you know, [my ex] really sucked but at least I got 2 best friends out of him” (bc we met through him) and I nearly cried I was so happy. She called me her best friend! It just felt really good. 

Also I’ve been worried that they might hang out with my ex again some day because although he was terrible he was less terrible to them and they were his friends first. They can absolutely do whatever they want and hangout with whoever, but it would hurt a little to hear that they were friends again, especially since they knew how bad he was to me. They always said that they were done with him for good but it was just a worry in the back of my mind, especially since my ex had been pestering them a lot lately to hang out (apparently they’ve ignored it all). But last night one of them said that he reached out to her to meet up and she said yes purely because she’s curious as to what he’ll have to say and not at all because she wants to be friends with him (she wants to see if he’ll own up to any of his bullshit), but that if I was uncomfortable with that she would cancel it no questions asked. Of course I said I didn’t have a problem with it at all but I appreciated her asking. It just felt good to know that they still have my back.

I knew all about your past, and I still accepted you and gave you a fair chance.

I trusted you wouldn't become the same person you worked so hard to no longer be.

Even when you let me down I continued to forgive you in the hopes you'd prove me wrong, and show me just how powerful your will to be better was.

78,"My relationship has been long distance for most of its existence. It's really tough to deal with at times. I suffer from some mental health problems and I am in need of something. I don't know what exactly. And if psychiatrists can't figure this out, obviously no one else can. And that's okay.

What prompted me to block him last night was because talking to him had become a burden. Not that I didn't dislike it, but it became stressful. Whenever I wasn't feeling good, I felt like I was annoying. The fact that I cannot comfort him when he needs it, I felt like I wasn't being a good spouse. And when things weren't going well in my personal life, I had anxiety. You know that same anxiety you get as a kid when you did something you shouldn't have done and you can hear your parents approaching. It was unbearable.

On top of that, I started relying on him for everything. He was the only person I would speak to. He was the only person I would seek comfort from. But after a while, it didn't feel right. The kind of comfort I needed wasn't what I got. Which isn't his fault at all, it's mine. But it was exhausting to be in so much mental anguish and not being able to find any kind of peace. Sometimes, he would get frustrated at me for nor being so responsive. All in all it just didn't feel right.

I live completely alone. I do not have friends nor family (I do not speak to them for various reasons). Before I met him, I was in the same situation. Completely alone. I do not need a whole lot of social interactions to be okay, and passively interacting with people on Reddit would fill my sociability quota. I want to go back to that. I don't want to cling to him as a source for emotional support or social interactions. I want to get that from myself, even if it's much less than what he's capable of giving me. I want to deal with my emotions alone, even if it ends up being unhealthy. I want to be completely alone, and have days when I do not interact with anyone whatsoever. It is in a way unhealthy, but when I was in that same situation before he and I met, while I was still sad, it was a different sadness. Instead of feeling anger and actively wanting to kill myself, I felt it passively. I was just sad, not angry. And I would much rather be sad than angry.

Seeking professional help does not work. I am close to a decade of running after psychiatrists, psychologists, alternative therapy. I can't be doing this all the time, so I will do what I know can help at the moment. 

So. Yeah.",24Jun2019,1
79,"I met a guy on tinder. (Oh man) He persistently hit me up for 3 weeks, every day. I was attracted to his effort and humor. That is uncommon for me. Not to mention, he’s a very good looking guy. 

Slept with each other on the first date. Knew he was married twice before. The sex was beautiful. The date was great. He was kind, respectful. I kept saying I didn’t want to promise sex because I wanted to respect my body. I’d been through too many one night stand/fob situations where I wanted more but became a second object in the end. Maybe I’m not girlfriend material... idk. I broke that promise to myself because I felt lonely and vulnerable. He didn’t say no to my advances. I should’ve stopped. A flood of insecurity and fear from my past cane up. “Okay, I slept with them. How are they going to hurt me now?” Granted, nothing has ever gone right for me after giving myself. Surprisingly, he wanted to set up a second date but ended up flaking that Saturday. Probably because ...

The day after, I put my foot down. I said I didn’t want to sleep with him again. I didn’t feel good about it afterwards the first time. Then, silence. For days. His texts became sparser. Eventually I had to pry for a reason. He didn’t want to do long distance with me (I was an hour away, moving to grad school in 2 months), and even though I was a gem, I made him realize he didn’t want to start a relationship again. This hurt. I really, really liked him. Guilt doubled for having sex at this point.

I was upset, but we kept talking bc I still wanted to be friends. I learned after opening up to him about my past that his exes abused him “because they were abused” (as he put it). And he secretly had a fear of women “like me”. In addition, he felt ashamed he kept on attracting “damaged girls” “like me”. Not sure how much of it is true, but it effected him enough to say “had I known about your past, I wouldn’t have let things get as far as they did”. “Nothing can happen between us”. It effected me too. I broke down completely. Idk how I’m supposed to react to someone who marks things I didn’t choose to go through as red flags. That my trauma made me undesirable or a risk.

So after everything, I STILL wanted to keep talking to him. I saw his pain and empathized - despite feeling used and totally run over by the last interaction. In person, I fell for him hard and fast. He pushed all my buttons right in person.

At the end of our last phone call we decided to be friends who were still “attracted to one another”. He said he “cared for me”. This developed into him hitting me up and conversations becoming very sexual. Phone sex ensued. I didn’t feel good about it - but I kept obliging because it seemed like the only time he was as attentive as before. He’d send me pictures of scantily clad women. Tell me he “couldn’t behave”. That he wished I could have sex with him without him “hurting me”. Every time we talked he moved the conversation into flirting and women/sex. Any time I’d try to say he hurt me or open up about feelings, he’d say “I can’t be that pillar for you” and “I’ve sacrificed too much of myself for women. I won’t do it again”. Days before I moved states, after every excuse not to see me being an hour away, he booty called me. No phone call. Just asked if I wanted to have “fun”. 

All this being said, I’ve observed my faults. I fell too fast and started being serious too soon. Deep down, I know he’s a good person. But I can’t decide if I should just let him go. Every time we interact, I feel worse wondering about his motives. If in a way, I am preventing him from having a healthier outlook on women and his emotions towards them by being a sex object at his convenience. Is this a way for him to express his frustration/pain? Keeping me at a distance? Was his intention sex from the start? I’m hurt and confused. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.",24Jun2019,1

81,"for a little background, I'm 19 and have moved 15 times. all in the same area, though. I went to the same school k-graduation. I'm from the Midwest in a middle of a bunch of cornfields. two years ago, I moved 30 minutes away to a slightly bigger town and kinda made my life here. I still see people from ""home"" occasionally, but not often. 

I recently got a job offer in the LA area of California. nearly 1900 miles away. I thought about it, and decided to say fuck it and go! I don't really have family here aside from my mom who I don't see that often, and there's nothing holding me here. I'm 19, single, and have no kids. I figured if I'm gonna take the risk, now is the perfect time to do it. worst case scenario is the job doesn't work out, I end up broke, and have to drive back to the Midwest. but I'd rather do that than be 50 and wishing I would've taken the chance. 

I'm super excited, but also scared shitless. I applied for this job with no real intention of actually getting it. I have to be there in 3 weeks and I have no money saved up, and although the company has a relocation stipend of $2000, I won't receive that until after I'm out there; I have to pay out of pocket to initially get out there. 

my plan as of now is to sell everything I have (which isn't much. really just my bed, dresser, desk, and some clothes) except for clothes and essentials I'm going to take. I'm going to pack my suitcases and bags into the car, and drive out there. a buddy of mine has a free flight to use, so he's driving out there with me and flying back. I have asked friends/family for help, but again, we're all from a super small town where nobody really has money to lend out. I have about $3k in credit line for ""emergencies"" and that's what I'm going to have to use for food/gas/anything else I need to pay for in the mean time, until I get my first couple checks from my new job.

if you've managed to read all that, thank you. I'm super proud of myself, I've worked so hard to be able to get out of the Midwest, and I'm going to make it work. with that, if anybody has any type of advice, please feel free to say it. (-:",24Jun2019,1

I have 3 Guinea pigs and 2 ferrets that I love ever so dearly. I could tell you about them forever. Tell you their favorite food and favorite things to do. I used to be wonderful at taking care of them, they had plenty of space, floor time every day. I cuddled and kissed all of them. I chopped up salads for my pigs 2-3 times a day.

For the past couple of months I've been beyond depressed and havent given them nearly as much attention, they dont usually get floor time and everything has just gotten so out of hand I've really been thinking it's time to rehome them. I really really dont want to because of how much I love them but I'm starting to really feel like it just isnt fair to them.

I guess I'm mainly scared of them going somewhere where they arent treated as wonderfully as they deserve to be and I'm also scared of the judgement I know I'm going to get. I dont think I deserve them but I dont want people to think I'm just trying to pawn them off to someone else. And my parents never liked my pets so I know they're going to say something if I suddenly dont have them anymore.

But anyway, I added him on Instagram and now we're actually talking. This guy makes me feel super comfortable. He also texts back super quick and texts first and he seems excited to talk to me honestly which I always overthink about. 

I know this could end up with just us being friends but woah, I've never really met a person who initiates conversations and has a huge interest in my life. 

Eeeeee why am I so excited",24Jun2019,6
88,"6 months ago I made the easiest and scariest decision of my life. I left my ex who physically, verbally and emotionally abused me, and I realize that I am far more damaged than I thought.

I'm having a hard time ""adulting"". Going to the grocery store on my own sends me into a panic attack, being the one to make decisions pushes me over the edge...I have a wonderful partner who is incredibly supportive and has been helping me regain my independence, but I feel like I'm drowning.

93,"How am I supposed to stay in the closet when everyone is constantly reminded of LGBTetc and may start questioning. and how would I leave if all they see now during pride shit is drag queens and unicorn poop. fuck that, there's nothing to be neither proud or ashamed of. people have the right to dislike stuff, that's never gonna change, so it's pointless and makes people like me actually unconfortable.",24Jun2019,1
94,"10 months back; I'll go with anyone out to eat or just walk even if I'm not gonna eat or not really in the mood for walk just because the other person might feel lonely and sad. In return, if I ask someone to go out with me and get a no in return, I used to get so upset, getting angry and feeling worthless. I would feel so betrayed that if I'm coming with you on just your asking and not getting you to insist me for coming, than why can't you go when I want to go out. I would talk to my therapist about this and she would say, ""You're going out with them on your choice. They are not obliged to come with you because it's their choice."" And I would think that I'm making myself too available and that's why I'm losing my worth maybe. 
So I started going out alone, not happily of course, with a ""No, I don't need anybody. Fuck them"" mood. 

Now; I actually like to go out alone and have no problem at all eating alone, in fact, I prefer being alone. Go outside alone on a nice walk. I've realized it's easier and better to figure out stuff when alone, too(Duh). I'd go out at least 2 to 3 times a week alone, without asking my friends if anyone wants to go or not, to eat and enjoy a nice walk back. I wouldn't even go out with them, if I have something on my mind that needs to be figured out, even if they are insisting for me to come along with them and I've always found it better. Now, if I can't get my alone time, to figure out something, I start panicking more than I was already because of the thing lol. 
Sometimes, I feel like I'm being selfish and a total asshole for not wanting my friends around to figure out some problem of mind.


I just needed to let this out.

TL;DR: I used to be afraid of going out alone but now as I've done it, I prefer going out alone.",24Jun2019,3

To put it in short, I know it is a pretty common thing to grow old, everyone does. But it is the fact that I would be looked upon as an “adult” and would be looked upon to act as one worries me. 

Not much has changed in me except the age, I still act goofy, I am very moody, I don't like responsibilities and I am a little socially awkward when meeting new people. But, will people would still judge and want me to act as that perfect “adult”?",24Jun2019,1
97,I've been feeling a lot of anger inside me but today I decided to let it all out.

Punch by punch I let my self go all out and felt the anger turning into excitement. I stopped when I saw that my knuckles were bleeding a lot in both hands and got in patched up.

It not because I don’t want it but because I get so much anxiety when I go take my test. I tend to choke on simple tasks during the exam. Is there a point where it’s more reasonable to give up? 

Excuse the kind of rambling tone I’m really just looking for advice from other people on how they dealt with multiple failures in succession.

My girlfriend does at least an hour of intense exercise everyday and keeps encouraging me to do some basic workouts with her but I haven’t been able to bring myself to do anything. So today I turned on my tv and went on YouTube, and I did some basic Tai Chi (something I’d been really interested from growing up watching Avatar: The Last Airbender) and I feel so good about myself. I’ve had so much pent up anger and I’ve tried to get it out by screaming but, even though I haven’t done a lot, I feel really good. I’m just finally proud I’ve been able to get up off my ass and do something for myself without someone else telling me what to do.

103,"I see so many posts on relationship and finance threads about couples and how they should split rent, bill, going out, etc. Personally, I've had this talk with my bf and we decided that when we move in together I'd pay for all of the rent and hed pay for the bills and groceries. Hes also stated that he didnt mind paying for everything if he ends up making more than me (he hasnt graduated yet whilst I'm working at my first job). Idk I feel like if you really love the other person money shouldn't really be something to worry about but it seems everyone else seems dead set on counting every dollar and cent the other person contributes. It's kinda the same thing with my friends. I'll spot them for coffee sometimes and they get me the next time, theres no venmo requesting for things that are like 5 dollars lol. They're my close friends so I dont mind spending some extra on them and dont ask for it back. Why do people care so much about splitting things and having money issues with those they are close with? It's really just money. Itd be different if maybe I couldnt afford to be doing this or couldnt pay for the whole rent but it seems as if most people posting about this, live comfortable lives but are just obsessed with making sure their SOs contribute equally lol.",24Jun2019,3
104,"Anxiety is something I believe we all suffer from, some of us just handle it better than others because we have the right coping mechanisms to deal with it. Sadly, I am not one of those people.

For the longest time I thought I had it worse than everybody else, dealing with chronic depression and anxiety every day of my life for years now. It wasn’t until only recently I realised that I do not have any good coping methods. Not healthy ones, at least. I’ve been getting involved with drugs recently (nothing hard or crazy like cocaine or heroin, just abusing things like adderall and xanax to treat my symptoms, although I’ve had my fair share of MDMA and psychedelics) and would much rather something healthier and more socially acceptable.

The problem is, when I’m alone, I just don’t know what to do with myself. So I reach for drugs to try and cover up my anxiety because they work and make me feel so happy.

**TL;DR:** So with all that being said, my question is a simple one: Let’s say there’s nothing going on. Nobody can hang out or everyone’s at work...what are some good coping methods for chronic anxiety? What activities are there to do that I can fill my time with? For some reason I have a very difficult time coming up with something to do on my own and I don’t have a particular activity that I’m passionate about.

If you have any questions please ask me. Any advice is appreciated.",24Jun2019,3

115,"- My Manager

Like dude, how bad do you have to be as a Manager? There's a reason why everyone bypasses you and comes to me for help. There's a reason why I am the one doing building maintenance, ordering supplies, assisting with payroll, managing projects, training new hires, creating new job positions and the list go's on and on. 

That reason? You are a shit manager. 

You're a good person, but an absolutely horrible manager. You belittle everyone. You drive me drink and overeat. You cause me to give up my hobbies so I can work on tasks outside of work hours that you should be doing. You cause me to literally count the minutes until my next shift and sob in the shower before work. 

My Aunt just died of what appears to be a stress related stroke. And when I voice the fact that I literally am getting chest pains, chronic migraines and fucking anxiety attacks you respond by texting on your phone and telling me that I have no reason to be so stressed out. 

You remove the extra resource on my team that I fought **four months for.** And then you bitch about how we are taking longer than necessary and should be outputting much more! 

Increased Tasks - Decreased Employees = More Stress! :D 

A simple equation that most humans would understand. But not you, oh definitely not you. Our team members didn't even turn the lights on for an entire week while I was dealing with my Aunt's death. They. Worked. In. Darkness. Why? Because everyone is depressed at this job.

I thought I was going to marry this girl. We’d dated for eight months. She was the love of my life dudes. 

I know it’s good that we split up because we had very different sexual drives that cause a lot of tension in the relationship and is ultimately the main reason for us splitting up, but it’s still hard. Especially because she’s seemed to have moved on much quicker than I would have expected.

I’m not a crier and I’ve cried more in the last 4 days than the rest of my life combined. I know it’ll get better though.

123,"My boss and my former principle have destroyed my confidence with one small sentence and one email that wasn't even meant to reach me.


I have been working overtime. For a year now. Last week I worked everyday including my weekend. 3 of those 7 days were 13 hour work days with only a 5 minute break.

I didn't mind. I like my job.
Today my boss went to another employee who only works one day a week and told him ""you're the only one around here who puts in any effort"".

I know it's not *bad* - it's not a personal attack. But it made me feel worthless and unappreciated.
I have been working twice the amount of hours that are stated in my contract for a year now. Every week. I've worked so many weekends and all I hear is I don't put in any effort. I was about to ask for a pay raise because I thought they saw how much I've put into this...
I don't want to go back there tomorrow. I feel like a fool. Like a joke. 


2. Person to tear me down today.

My old principle (acting school).
I graduated from an acting school 2 years ago and started my own little series with a friend of mine. It's anything but a great production. We were just having fun. We're German actors and actresses who wanted to put something out there to ""show our English skills"". 
We put the first episode of our little series on Instagram a few days ago. Today one of the actresses, who we casted sent me an email she had received from my former and her current principle. It read:

""I hope you only acted in that one episode of Cop and Copper (the name of our little series).
The writing is horrible and the acting is bad. Why act in English if none of the cast can speak English? No students of our school are to ever take part in that series. ""

That principle used to praise me to the fullest. We put ourselves out there and he crushed us. He didn't even tell us himself but we had to find out through one of the actresses.

The film business is hard enough as it is. Having your own principle talk about you in that manner... Man

126,"I'm currently in Europe for the first time in my life, finally realizing a dream I have had since I was a child. However, I couldn't feel shittier. It's barely been 4 days away from home on a 30 day stay. 

For some context, my school has several campuses spread throughout my country and a requirement for graduating is having a 'multicultural' experience, which basically consists on studying abroad for either a semester or a month during summer.

I am the only student from my campus, so basically I signed up to study abroad for one month with 60 people who I've never met in my life. After crying from nerves a few days before leaving, I arrived at the airport feeling optimistic and pumped for an awesome month of visiting several European countries which I've dreamt of visiting since I was a child, and probably make some awesome friends along the way. How could anyone not be excited? 

The first day, however, I was just miserable from being homesick. I thought this would quickly go away, after all, who doesn't get nervous or miss home, even on the first day of a trip? The second day comes, and I feel exactly the same way, already counting down to when I get to go home. This day however, I had a good time dining with my new friends, so I thought things would just get much better from then on. Third day; I'm absolutely miserable for the first half of the day, so much so that I just went to my hotel room to cry alone. This was absolutely alleviating, I just felt like I had this and this would actually be an enjoyable experience. I then went on to have an awesome day with my new friends. So thinking this is over, I wake up the next day (today) with a positive outlook on things and just being plain optimistic and excited about getting to know my friends better. Today we flew out to our next destination, the city which I was most excited about, and the one where we're staying the most time in. Checking in to our hotel it turns out I'm now staying at my room with three other guys (instead of just one like at the last destination). After going into my room I go to meet my new roommate, and it turns out it's this guy who sat next to me on the plane who I really disliked. No problem, two more roommates to meet. They get to our room and it turns out it's my last roommate, who is really nice but also terribly annoying and lastly a friend I made. Our room is this old confined space with uncomfortable beds and a dirty bathroom.

The first three days I felt depressed from my homesickness, but this last one this desperation to run back home mixed with anger and frustration overcame me. I just couldn't speak a word, otherwise the tears would have just started flowing. I wanted to cry so bad, but I'm not doing so on my room with my three roommates and I also am not allowed out of my room after curfew. I just ended up bottling things up, all that frustration and desperation, and just sadness and loneliness like I've never felt before in my life. I miss my friends, my home, my bed, my parents. I hate the people here, I hate where I'm staying here. You're probably thinking what about what an ungrateful son I am, which believe me, I've noticed but can't help it. It becomes this cycle of feeling ungrateful, which makes me feel wasteful, and in turn makes me feel guilty. Every second here feels like an hour, these past four days have felt like a year. I don't know how I will make it through 24 more days of this.

He just has a way of making jokes and being occasionally harsh that hurt my feelings, and for some reason, instead of being an adult, I'm letting it bother me to the point that I still spend all day in bed). Even though I know I can sew, speak some fair French, have a good GPA at college, capable of coding (though I don't code often because I spend too much of the day sulking), I feel like I have no employable skills whatsoever.

I went to back up my car and leave, but someone either didn’t see me or didn’t care, as they raced pass me and I almost hit them.

I started panicking after and was too scared to try backing up again until the parking lot was almost cleared out. 

I was crying and hyperventilating, so I couldn’t go to the gas station.

I made it home, sat in the car until I composed myself. I kinda wanted to tell someone about it, but didn’t want to upset anyone or embarrass myself.

My grandma had sent me out to get the bread. I didn’t want her to feel like I was trying to make her feel bad for having me run an errand for her; nor think poorly of me because I couldn’t handle such a simple thing.

I couldn’t tell my SO because he might have felt like I was trying to make him feel bad for not going with me. Plus, a few years ago I was depressed and/or anxious (who remembers anymore?) and tried talking to him. He said something like “It’s always something. Always something everyday.” I’ve done my best to not mention stuff like that to him since then.

I’ve calmed down now, but just feel lonely not being able to tell anyone. I wanted someone to know. I’m not sure why, it’s really unimportant. But here I am anyway. Iunno. I guess if the things I did made sense, things wouldn’t be so messy all the time.",24Jun2019,6
