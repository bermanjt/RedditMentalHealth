0,"I'm very sorry but I just need to get this off my chest, this question has been bugging me for months but I need to give y'all my backstory first. My question is am I weak or do I need help. It's gonna be long and im sorry about that and please forgive my bad grammar. 


 My parents were very strict with me and my brother ( who is 2 years younger than me, I'm 17 right now ) they never let us go out in the streets except to play with the neighborhood kids but that is it. Both my parents were very mean to me they would always yell at me and hit me almost in a daily basis, to the point where I was scared to defend myself against them, but my brother had it alot easier than me for some reason. I was also very overweight for a kid and alot of kids made fun of me for it. I was never fast nor athletic like the other kids. They would always get me when we're playing tag because I was an easy target. I never talked to the girls because they would awlays make fun of me for being fat and ugly. I never had any social skills because I was always in my house. So when kids went up to me I didnt know what to do. So for years and years I was always alone. It went to the point where I would sit by the rejects because i didnt want to be alone, and strangely I was rejected by the rejects. They would verbally abuse me and ditch me in secret but I didnt care I was desperate for friends. Thats how my life was in school, I would be abused and neglected by my classmates, I was a very kind child, I would help someone if they  dropped something but everyone, especially the girls, would scream ""ew dont touch me"" and ""ew dont touch my stuff"" but only to me, even though I was trying to help. I ended up being scarred of girls because of that. I couldnt touch anyone because I was scarred that they would embarrass me again, except for my siblings i would always touch them. But the older I got, the fear faded away but im still scarred to touch girls to this day. Freshman year came by and I ended up having a crush on this girl, she wasnt popular but she was everything to me at that time but a couple months later she found out and her and her friends made fun of me for it. I lost all my self esteem and I became more angry and aggressive towards everyone including my parents. My little sister, who was 7 years younger than me, was very spoiled, as the youngest she got what she wanted and talked my mom and dad the way she wanted to, but brother was just like her except less spoiled but more bitchy. She and my brother talked to our parents a whole lot differently than me. They talked to them as if they were friends, especially to my mom, while I talk to them Both as if they were gods. Pretty wierd huh? My sister  became older and bigger and didnt want to play with me anymore, she tries her best to get away from me, I became even sadder. I lost all motivation to do anything and I became even fatter, I couldnt concentrate on my school work or anything, everyday when I came back from school I would flop on my bed and would be forced to get off of bed by my mom or dad. To this day I'm not sure if it was depression because people these days ruined that word so I'm sure if it was. I turned 16 and my sadness became stronger and more unbearable. My mom was very worried about me and she even try to talk my Dad into taking me to a therapist but my dad said that it was just a teenage phase. Both my siblings were abusing my kindness and treated me like my classmates do. I couldnt take it anymore, I wasnt going to let the only people that I love treat me like shit like everyone else does. My brother sees me as a joke because I was so outgoing and friendly he never took me seriously. He started to lift weights and everything while I was lazy and getting weaker. I was so insecure and so angry at my self I even hated myself. One day my brother slammed a door really hard and I yelled at him, to annoy me even more he slammed it again and I ended up fist fighting with him. It was so bad my mom intervind and I screamed, shouted and cursed at my brother right in his face, he became scarred of me and i laughed at him. A couple minutes later my mom was lecturing me and all of the sudden I started crying really hard for some reason, all of my horrible memories came back at once and i was crying even harder. I dont know why I did. Now the strangest thing happened, my mother, who would always help me emotionally and always backed me up in every way said that I should be ashamed of my self because I was almost a grown ass man and I was having a temper tantrum like a 5 year old. She told me she and other people had worse lives than me and that I have it easy. To this day I never talked to my mom about my problems again. After she lectured me I thought about what my mom said and I started to hated myself, I always called myself weak and pathetic. I was filled with hatred and anger towards everyone. Senior year came by and I seem to be more calm and I really dont care about anyone or their opinions about me anymore. They just dont affect me. I still dont have motivation to do anything. I'm still very sad but I hide it because it gets in the way of my school work. My life is still the same except in no longer with the abusive rejects. My mother and father still yell at me but not as bad as they used too. But what do y'all think I'm a weak and patheticlly minded or do i need help? ",02Mar2019,1
1,"Finally got to hang out with these group of friends i always admired. They’re seniors (I’m a junior) and they’re rad and don’t gossip like my previous group. 
Felt nice to talk about cool videos and play volleyball/soccer instead of making fun of the asian kids or talking about who had sex with who. 

They’ll leave soon, sure, but it reminds me how fun high school can be with the right people

Hanging with toxic people makes YOU toxic, and no you shouldn’t bother fixing them, that’s a fool’s errand and i learned that the hard way. Good day B)",02Mar2019,0
2,"My dad yells at me a lot to find a job. I cry every time after in my room and call every place I applied to that week to check again and see if they're still hiring. I know we're struggling, but that's not my fault. I'm not the one going out and eating almost everyday. I don't take my brother out to eat almost every day. I don't buy crazy diet foods. I drink out of the tap and not the bottled water. At one point I even just starved myself and didn't take any showers and just existed and it was still my fault. I didn't live at home for a while and it was still my fault. When I binged I binged on ramen and peanut butter. I don't see a cardiologist because I know we can't afford it. I ignored my medical problems for months and went to the emergency room when it finally became unbearable because you guilt tripped me and said we couldn't afford it and for me to suck it up. I hate you dad. I got a full ride to college and I worked my ass off to be sixth in my class of 400. For an almost perfect gpa. The one time I take off time from school to get my mental health in order you continue to destroy it. 

Fuck you.",02Mar2019,7
3,"I have a somewhat unusual hobby, which is known as worldbuilding. I build worlds for fun. I build their cultures, their languages, their histories. How I love listing out each name, each date, and different facts. I have lists and lists of ideas. I'm so very tired, it's almost like an addiction. If I don't worldbuild I feel like I have nothing to live for. I'm so lonely and I'm so tired, I've had this obsession for years. If I don't worldbuild im nithing 

I wish, I wish, I wish I had a normal hobby like motherfucking chess, or football, or jigsaws. Fucking anything except worldbuilding. It's hard seeing all my work destroyed and recycled and destroyed again and again and again and again ",02Mar2019,3
4,"This is how the easing of Sino-American diplomatic relations officially started according to Kissinger: “The deadlock was broken when we ordered Walter Stoessel, the U.S. ambassador in Warsaw, to approach Chinese diplomats at the next social function and express the desire for a dialogue. The setting for this encounter was a Yugoslav fashion show in the Polish capital. The Chinese diplomats in attendance, who were without instructions, fled the scene. The Chinese attaché’s account of the incident shows how constrained relations had become. Interviewed years later, he recalled seeing two Americans talking and pointing at the Chinese contingent from across the room; this prompted the Chinese to stand up and leave, lest they be drawn into conversation. The Americans, determined to carry out their instructions, followed the Chinese. When the desperate Chinese diplomats speeded up, the Americans started running after them, shouting in Polish (the only mutually intelligible language available), “We are from American embassy. We want to meet your ambassador… President Nixon said he wanted to resume his talk with Chinese.”

5,"I started talking with this guy a little while ago and we really seem to be hitting it off. We’ve got a lot of similar interests, nerd out together over movies and TV shows, etc. so there’s never a dry conversation, and I really enjoy his company.

Earlier this evening he asked me if I’d like to go to the movies with him sometime, which sent me over the moon. I told him yes. 

This’ll be my first date in all my eighteen years on this Earth.

I’m in uni English,and then out of nowhere I get really nervous and I’m not even sure if I’m in uni and not in college level English) I don’t know why it’s happening to me. And It makes me really really anxious and I start moving a lot. Some other stuff like that happen to and I just wanna know what it is. Uhh also like I had a test today and I was sooo worried I’d forget my cheat sheet at home(we were allowed to have one) and I almost started crying this morning because I was scared I was going to lose it or spill water on it.

9,"Asian females get better lives than Asian males. People like them, more likely to get a job in entertainment due to them being seen as sexy. Also do you ever realise in Hollywood, when they try to include asian actors to promote diversity you can bet its always female. And do you realise for news anchors there is an alarming number of Asian females but no Asian males.

They are also seen as sexy or cute. You might say that it's dehumanising but at least they're wanted. For Asian males nobody even bothers to get to know us.

10,"Feels good man. It’s been about a month or more since I got dumped from a really good relationship and it took time to heal from that. I’ve improved myself as far as I can manage in that time and I’ve found sources of happiness outside of romance, or at least I like to think so. It’s been an interesting month.

She’s cute, like she’s an absolute doll. She’s a musical theater major and she looks like a star. I’m a music major and that’s already something we have in common. We go to the same school but I’ve never met her. We met on tinder and out of all our matches she stood out to me and apparently I stood out to her. She’s a singer/songwriter. She seems like a happy human being who’s sure of herself and healthy and knows what she wants and that’s exactly what I’m looking for.

And I mean hey, if it doesn’t work out I won’t be upset. Life’s too short to be upset over that kind of stuff at that stage of something, but it is something to take into consideration. Gotta have my bases covered for myself in that regard, no matter how much I want something to happen. Keep it natural and live in the moment. I’m not even nervous but I am excited.

I don’t know if she uses reddit or if she’ll see this but if you do then hello and I can’t wait for Sunday :)",02Mar2019,19
11,"Get your feels ready.

My first ever gf was this redhead farmgirl. My first date, kiss, blowjob, sex..literally first everything was with this girl. We started dating in Junior year after talking and hanging out for months in 10th grade and over summer break. Towards the beginning, the relationship went strong and continued strong well into Senior year until it came to an abrupt end after an ill-fated spring break party. She went to all of my football and baseball games, I had dinner with her family on multiple occasions, her parents and my parents became friends through our relationship...you name it. The entire school knew we were dating and we almost won best couple in our Senior yearbook. We even applied and got accepted to the same colleges, and eventually chose to go to the same college, which ended up not happening (thank the fukkin lord). Summarily, I was ready to marry this girl at the young age of 17 because she was all I knew as far as women went. Man I was fukkin dumb. 

Long story short, that didn't happen. Fast forward to March 2018. 2 months away from graduating high school, she began to act distant. One word text answers, little sex, and when we did have sex, she was disengaged, uninvolved, just boring to say the least. We went from hanging out every day to her having some kind of excuse almost every time I wanted to see her. It was ""I'm busy"" this and ""I'm busy"" that or ""I feel bad"" so she couldn't hang out et cetera...just all kinds of bullchit excuses. We went to being together all the time to just seeing her at school and maybe after school twice a week. I couldn't understand why she was acting like that, but I blindly trusted her like the cuck I was, so I didn't ask any questions or investigate further. I continued on like this, and kept my promise to her to go all out for our Senior prom since it was our last one ever. 10 of my buddies and their dates split a limo with us, which still came out to $120 a person. We even snuck in some alcohol that she copiously helped herself to on the way to the prom venue, which I also spent around $150 on, not to mention another huge chunk of change for the bouquet of flowers and the professional photos that we took. All in all it was over $400 I spent on her which was huge for a kid in high school. I even asked my dad to help out with his hard earned money, which he happily did. She seemed to genuinely appreciate it all, and acted very lovey dovey and attentive with me all night, which was probably due to the alcohol in her system but whatever. I didn't mind because I loved her and she was giving me all her attention at that point in time, which was all I wanted for my efforts. Fast forward to a few hours into prom - My girl along with some of her girlfriends were plastered at this point. Towards the beginning, we were having a good time and dancing together, kissing et cetera, but her attitude began to change later into the night. It was an almost 180 degree change from how she acted at the photo shoot, dinner and on the dancefloor with me. As soon as we returned to our table, her and her girlfriends ran off to the bathroom to drink more alcohol and didn't come back for almost an hour if I recall. I sat at the table with 2 other dudes just chit chatting, waiting on her to come back, not realizing that she was already back on the dancefloor in a group where I couldn't see her. I walk over to join her, and we dance for maybe 5 minutes until she started running around hugging everyone like a social butterfly, dancing with her ""guy"" friends including dudes on my baseball team, hugging them as well and just generally ignoring me. She grinded with other dudes to rap songs, slow danced with dudes that she knew I hated right in front of me, it was horrible. I had no idea what caused her change in attitude. I left her alone and went back to the table, sat down for a while pretending to text on my phone for a few minutes hoping she'd come over to join me, but she never did. I ended up leaving with a buddy of mine who knew I was pissed and kinda saw what was going on with her slootness (still friends with him today). He didn't have a date, so we just ditched prom, jumped in his car, and went to a party that friends from another HS were hosting that night. A few hours into the party, I get a text from my girl later in the night saying she's sorry for how she acted, and asking where I was and wanted to meet up. Being the beta that I was, I said ""don't be sorry it's OK"", gave her the address to the party and asked if she needed a ride. 10 minutes passed, 30 minutes, then an hour passed. I text her again with ""Are you coming?"" No reply, and she never showed up. I slept alone that night with millions of thoughts running through my head, thinking about her and the guys she grinded on in front of me a few hours earlier. Sunday came and went without one text or call from her. I was hung-over, nervous and angry, not knowing what to do with myself but worry for the rest of the weekend. 

Fast forward to Monday at school, she texts me to apologize, and asks to have lunch with her so we could talk. I once again beta cuck myself and oblige instead of telling her to fuk off like I should have. We get to talking about what happened at prom and she continued to apologize again and again for how she acted. I asked her what she did after prom ended, and she said she ended up just passing out at her girlfriend's house. She also kept going on about how sorry she was for acting weird to me over the past few weeks and all kinds of bullchit about how stressed she's been with graduation and ending high school, missing her friends, leaving our hometown...all kinds of dumb teen girl crap. I continue to be her cuck and console her, reminding her that college is gonna be awesome together and how the future is gonna be, all kinds of cringey **** that I would never say to a girl today. She started crying right there in the cafeteria and got up to kiss and hug me, promising to never act the way she did again. Weeks pass and she kept her promise - we started doing things together and continued on like how we were when we first started dating. The only thing that changed was how people were reacting to us being together as usual again. I started to see smirks on people's faces as we walked by, weird expressions from other people, just an overall odd feeling from some of my friends and her friends when we interacted with them. Some of the dudes I hated even started to act nice to me all of a sudden. I couldn't quite figure out why people were acting differently around us when we were together, so I just ignored it since all I cared about was being with her like we used to be. I never put 2 &amp; 2 together...

Moving on into April, we continued to be together like how it was when we first started dating - hanging out together every day, doing everything together, dinner, sex, movies, everything. I was on cloud 9, ready to start college with her and enjoy many more years together. Our final spring break loomed on the horizon, and it was time to start making plans. I wanted to take her on a trip to the mountains, just the 2 of us - something romantic to bring us even closer together, but needless to say, she had other plans. She wanted to stick around and go to beach house parties, drink with her girlfriends and just get sloshed all week with the rest of the senior class. Naturally this turned into an argument between us, I told her there will always be parties we can get drunk at but she was having none of it. She wanted to be with her friends and that was final. The argument over the whole deal ended with her slamming the door of my Subaru as hard as she could and storming into her house. After that argument, she acted worse than she did before prom. She ignored all my texts and calls, ignored me at school, and turned her friends against me. All I had left was my small circle of buddies, baseball and the excitement of Spring Break along with graduation. 

Spring Break comes around and still no contact from my girl. It was the final Friday in class before it started, and everyone was buzzed with excitement except me. I looked around the room and decided to stop being a said kunt right then and there. I quit trying to maintain contact with her and decided to go buck wild for my final hurrah as a HS student. Me and a few m8's decided to rent out a beach house, hit as many parties as we could, drink and bang sloots - (well they banged sloots, I was still busy thinking about my girl no matter how hard I tried) and just have a good time. We had a great fukking time, and I made bonds with dudes I still talk to today, but it all came crashing down when I got a text from you know who. 

""Hey let's forget about everything that has happened, I'm at Chad's party, come over and let's hangout."" 

Now before we continue, Chad is a made up name for a dude that I absolutely hated. I had to endure being on the same football team as him along with some of his other friends who I also hated, but I digress. She was at his party, and being deprived of her presence for so long, I of course left my group to go over there alone. I regret this decision to this day. 

I arrive at the party and it's none other than Chad who greets me. He's got a smile on his face, a beer in his hand and joyfully ushers me in and gives me a beer. I awkwardly meander past drunk people and the large crowd until I make it to the kitchen. I chilled with him and some of his crew for a bit, chit chatting about bullchit while I look around trying to see where my girl is at. Some of her friends are there slutting around with a few of the guys and having a good time, but she's nowhere to be seen, so I eventually walk around and start to ask if anybody has seen her. Chad pipes up and says ""Yo dude, lemme show you something real quick."" He leads me down the hallway, knocks on a door to one of the bedrooms, and some dude I don't recognize cracks open the door. Chad says ""open it all the way."" He obliges and I look over to the bed, and my heart immediately drops. 

I look up and see my girl completely naked, bent over on the bed giving another guy I don't recognize a blowjob. She looks up at the door and says ""oh hey WDP! By the way, we're done"", then goes back to licking the guys cock as she continues to stare at me standing there while I start to feel myself shaking. I wanted to look away but I couldn't - I didn't know what to do but stare and feel my heart get ripped out of my body. I just stood there until the guy that opened the door laugh in my face and tell me ""we'll be done with her in a little bit."" The door closes and I continue to stand there, wanting to open the door and kill everyone inside, but I feel Chad's hand grab my shirt as he pushes me against the wall. ""She's busy bud, now get the fuk out of here phaggot,"" and pushes me towards the doorway. There was no way I was gonna fight him alone with his crew there, so I slowly make my way to the door as people stare at me, wondering why I just got kicked out of one of the biggest parties that week. 

The next 6 weeks of high school were hell, but I made it out alive, and I haven't seen that bitch since. I don't even know where she is or what she's doing now, and I frankly don't care.

Warning, a lot of complaining and swearing.

It's been a long time coming. I was friends with her for the past ehhh 3 years maybe 4? And Over the past few years I've grown a lot. and this girl shes just seemed to stay in the same place. I'm sure shes grown in her own ways. But with interactions with me? it's the same childish Bullshit. Maybe 4 years ago or whenever I first met her I would have agreed. but now?

i have been through hell and back in the past few years and changed a lot. and now all I ever do is get irritated when I talk to her. she frustrates me SO much. everything she does annoys me, she is still as childish as ever, and still plays the victim card when things dont go her way. She is immature, and let's her fears get the better of her and limit herself. 

For the past year, I have been tolerating it. And trying so hard, to just. Keep this friendship up. and just ignore her dumb shit when it pops up. But today I just finally snapped. And honestly, I feel really bad about the way I told her. i was very mean about it. i said awful, rude things. And what's worse is that I beleive them. I am literally so sick and tired of this person and I have bit my tongue for so long because that's what friends do. but finally all the negative bad things I actually thought of her just unleashed. and it was mean as hell. And I feel bad, because i was so mean of me. I did apologize to her after, saying,  hey that was mean of me. But regardless of me being mean or not I still just do not want to associate with her anymore. because as I said. all the mean things, I meant. I cant tolerate her. I dont know how I have been tolerating her for so long. 

I dunno. on the one hand I think I acted out of anger but on the other hand, when I look back at all our interactions, most of the time?

I became extremely depressed when I went years feeling like a sub human failure incapable of being loved. I learned how to drive, rented a car and drove to Colorado. Things have been better but I've been called back to NYC because of something I never would have guessed would happen... My brother took his whole life.

My brother struggled with depression as well and things weren't made better by entering into a toxic relationship with a woman who has told him to kill himself repeatedly for some time now. To be fair, my brother wasn't an angel either but they should have just broken up. Instead they had three kids, separated, got back together, etc. 

Over the last few days, I don't feel like I've been able to grieve. I don't have the support system I clearly need and my mom seems to think she's the only one who deserves sympathy. Sometimes I really think she doesn't care about him, she only cares to have people give her attention. I had to yell at her today because she insists on fucking telling me the state of my brother's body and she took offense when I told her to stop, cutting her off from completing her statement. I can honestly say I hate my mother.

I don't know what to do. I feel like my life isn't meant to be happy. I struggle with people, I struggle with everything and now I've lost my brother. I'm just so sad...I tried to make a difference but now here I am, back where I don't want to be and immensely guilt stricken.",02Mar2019,3

29,"This is a story I've been wanting to tell for a while as I love telling it in person when I have the chance, but never really found a proper subreddit to post it on until now. Hopefully it's okay here. Anyway, story time. Buckle up because it's a bit on the long side.

When I was younger and my family was wealthier, my parents enrolled me into a private Catholic school. It was very small - you could stretch out your arms and touch both of the walls in the hallway. The nurse's office doubled as the reception desk, and the principal's office was two steps away from that. Bible study, art class, gym class, and music class were all compiled into one single room. Anyway, the point is the school was small and as expected from such small private schools, there weren't many kids there and they were all fairly sheltered.

Around the 4th grade, I was really into Ghibli films, most notably My Neighbor Totoro. For those who don't know, the movie is basically about a forest spirit who befriends and aids two young girls who have moved into the countryside. I was enamored with Totoro (the forest spirit) and had (and still have) a tiny collection of plushies of him. Well, come show-and-tell day I am super excited to bring my friends my favorite Totoro plushie in all of its glory. I don't remember exactly what I said about it, but my classmates quickly began to ask questions about my toy. Eventually, this girl who sat across from me at our table outright said it was ugly. That turned my 4th grade self into a ball of rage.

During this time, my house was undergoing an ant infestation. I remember this well because ants cluttered underneath my bed, and I would often shimmy under there to feed them with some crumbs. I didn't have pets at the time, so I considered them to be my pets until they were exterminated. Gross, I know. I was like 9 and very stupid.

Anyway, my mind goes back to the movie, and for some reason my stupid little 9-year-old mouth decided to blurt out ""Well, he's a forest spirit, and now he's gonna curse you!"". I don't know where the ""cursing"" thing came from, I assume it's because he was a spirit and I just immediately associated spirits with curses. Obviously, my classmates didn't believe me, and they all began to laugh in my face about my little proclamation mockingly asking me things like ""Oh, so does that mean you're a witch?"" and whatnot. I was extremely embarrassed. I just wanted to go to home now.

But then all of the stars in the sky aligned and the world decided to shine its mysterious light upon me.

One of the girls at my table that was just laughing seconds before let out a scream. We were all confused and just looked at her, and when she pointed at the table, everyone jumped back. The table was completely covered in ants. Thinking back on it, the ants most definitely came from either my lunchbox or backpack that were sitting on the table, but as everyone was too focused on me and my plushie, it looked like they came out of nowhere. I grabbed my plushie off of the table as to make sure it didn't get covered in ants, and as I look back up, the girl that called my plushie ugly was pointing at me and just yelled ""SHE'S A WITCH!"".

I stood there for a moment, trying to process everything, and then I let out a haughty laugh while the teacher was desperately trying to clean the table of the ants and said ""YEAH! I TOLD YOU!"". When recess came around, kids swarmed me and asked me if more terrible things would happen if people continued to mess with me, like a swarm of bees coming out to sting them. I just said ""yup"" to everything, and as word went around the school, nobody ever really messed with me after that.

I still have the Totoro plushie. He's all beat up now, but I keep him on my bed as a little memento of my favorite school memory.",02Mar2019,7
30,"I wouldn’t say I’m addicted, far from it in fact. I’ve only done it maybe 8 or 9 times but I can’t lie I do enjoy it. Today I threw a lip in while playing some video games, feeling pretty bored and maybe a bit anxious. It felt good, made me relaxed and I got that head-rush, but of course after it was over the guilt settled in and I regretted it. My mouth was hurting a bit, and although I’m sure it’s just a bit sore because I don’t do it that often, the feeling of rawness and aching in my cheeks felt horrible and I know the risks of dipping, just more and more problems with my mouth, gums, and teeth. It’s not worth it, not in the slightest. I’m not saying this is a huge achievement or trying to brag, just wanted to get it off my chest that I’m quitting this now before it gets any worse.

31,"It's weird because it's just a dumb site, but I still feel the need to reflect. It's just so fucking weird because I was 13 when I first started browsing here. 13! And now I'm 20. Jesus. I see 12-14 year olds on here and I'm like you shouldn't be on here, you're too young! But then I remember that I was on here when I was their age too. 

Anyway, no, I'm not a nazi. It just proves that I made this account when I was a kid. I loved the xfiles and couldn't think of a username, so I wanted to choose an episode name. ""Herrenvolk"" sounded cool and I didn't know what it meant. Sounding cool was good enough for me. And it was season 4 episode 1. I was *very* confused for a while when people would reply to me like ""weird you say that when you're a nazi."" It wasn't until I finally googled what it meant, and... oops. I still commented because most of the time no one noticed. But then it started to happen more and eh I didn't want to deal with it. So I stopped posting.

Could have made a new account but I like this one because it goes back in time. I posted here when I started Highschool and I was scared. I posted here when I was dealing with anxiety and depression. I posted here when I couldn't make any friends in Highschool. I posted here when I was scared of getting my license. When my grandmother got worse. When my dog died. When my grandfather died. When my grandmother finally died. My regrets about my grandfather dying. When I started college. When a friend died. When I just wanted to talk.

I remember all the novelty accounts. I remember WorstAnswerPossible, ShittyWatercolor, and damn there are some others I can't think of at the moment. And then there were some regular users you would see everywhere like unidan, andrewsmith1986, potato_in_my_anus, karmanaut, apostolate... damn. I used to see those guys EVERYWHERE. I got so used to them. 14 year old me loved being like ""haha hey it's that guy again!"" And then we all know what happened to the unidan, but the rest (for me at least) just kinda disappeared and then I never heard about them again. Not a bad thing, hope they're doing well and all that, just that hearing the names now is so weird because it just makes me realize how long it's been. I mean I'm in my 3rd year of college right now. Time never stops.

Let's be real. This site is shit. But it's the least shit community I've been able to find on the internet. So I love and hate it at the same time, as I'm sure most do. It actually taught me a lot. No really, hear me out. I've had some rough times in my life but nothing compared to most people. I was 14 and wanted to hear about other people's experiences and lives because everyone in my town that I knew was wealthy (not me) but never showed any hardships. Here I got to read all kinds of stories about loss, grief, pain, anger... just horrible horrible shit. But it humbled me. I learned a lot about what other people go through. What happens to people out there in this world. What can happen to anyone at anytime because the universe doesn't give a shit. I saw how some people responded and learned about what words seemed to help and what didn't. 

And yeah I know misinformation is an issue but most of time when I learned things on this site it was factual stuff. Yeah, I know, eyeroll. Hard to believe. But seriously. I'm talking some science and history. I've been able to contribute to my classes on information I learned here. I learned about phytoplankton and was able to talk about it in my environmental course. Hell, I think for the first time ever I (respectfully of course) corrected a professor on something she said about asbestos. Later she was like holy shit you were right, I'm sorry. Not trying to sound arrogant, I'm a dumb fuck. I guess what I'm trying to say here is that I have learned a lot useful stuff on this site. Helped me really get into history and science more. Loved browsing through historical photos or reading historical excerpts. Especially loved today I learned. I know some of that stuff is misleading and such but there's a lot I've learned from there that checks out when I would look more into it. I don't know. Still doesn't mean it's true, I know. But so far so good. 

Anyway. It's been a long time. Definitely a much bigger site now. A lot more people. A lot more opinions. A lot more bullshit. But I still hop on because I still like learning what I can on here. Plenty of really quality smaller subs. This is probably the last post I'll make on this account. If I want to say something I'll just use a throwaway. I don't know how much longer this site will last but it's been a good run. I don't have any regrets. Okay, maybe a few. But not too many.",02Mar2019,2

40,"My girlfriend is wonderful. She's the kindest, sweetest, most heartwarming person one can be. Our personalities clicked the moment we met, and we share a lot of the same humor. For the past 2 years, we've spent many an hour together, feeling warm and fuzzy in each other's arms. I could say without a doubt that I loved that girl with all of my heart, and I have no doubt of her love for me either.

But this year, things are a bit different. We've both had to go away to different cities, since our studies have begun to branch off. I only see her in person maybe once every two or so months. We do chat over Discord; spending a lot of time with each other on video, but it seems like our conversations have gotten rarer and less natural as we both delve deep into our work.

I just got off of another video call with her, and I realized that I felt next to no affection towards her while we were having our conversation. I even felt some mild annoyance at some of the things she said, though they were perfectly normal for a conversation between us.

I've been sitting here for a while now, and I've been spinning circles in my brain trying to figure out what's happening and what to do. Eventually, I reached a point where I asked myself, ""Do I even love her still?""

Now I'm faced with the prospect that the wonderful thing that we've had is now over, and that it's time to move on. But it's also possible that I'm just overreacting from a bad day, and that we'll get right back into our groove soon. I don't know. And that terrifies me.",02Mar2019,3

42,"Honestly it does get better. My suggestions for healing? Therapy, talking to as many people as possible and getting feedback and learning what went wrong and the warning signs you missed, as well as simply taking them off that pedestal. 

Mate, 7 weeks ago I was crushed, I wasn’t leaving bed, I wasn’t eating, I wasn’t taking pictures or making YouTube videos, I didn’t apply to or finish any of my grad school applications/fix up my CV, etc. I made well over 200 posts on here about it. Do I regret it? Fuck no, I’m a grown man and not afraid to say I loved a woman and was hurt. That’s the manliest thing you can do(loving a woman). 

My life was over as far as I was concerned. I’d lost the girl who I planned to marry and be with forever. The girl who I was going to have kids with, who got a tattoo about me, who was at my university graduation, a moment that’ll forever be in my mind. I contemplated suicide and called the national suicide hotline one night when I was on the verge. So I’ve literally been at rock bottom. 7 weeks later, with the help of my therapist, several breakup coaching calls, prayer and just time and patience, I’m feeling completely different. 

Not only do I no longer find myself consumed by thoughts of her and examining her toxic behaviour and going over the things she said and did/ I genuinely find myself caring less and less everyday. Who gives a fuck what she’s doing, she lost me, not the other way around. I gave her everything I possibly could and was down for her through everything. Including being cheated on. To everyone out there going through heartbreak, look yourself in the mirror and realise that you are worthy of being loved and being happy, just because someone didn’t value that, doesn’t mean you aren’t. That’s their loss, they lost genuine love, you lost someone who didn’t give a fuck at the end of the day, addition by subtraction.",02Mar2019,0

60,"Hello.
First of all I would like to clarify that I am not a native English speaker, so grammar errors and typos may occur.

Age: 15
Religon: my pranets are and so am I an atheist

To give you some long, but important backstory:
I should probably start with a kindergarten. Or to be more precise, how I was not in a kindergarten. My mom is extremely toxic towards various people. Not like she wants to, she tries to be a good person all the time. But she tends to be pissed off even because of a smallest things. That caused her to have an argument with the (f)kindergarten principal the second day I was there. I didn't come there any more. And instead of looking for a ""better"" kindergarten (this one was ok already) she just doesn't care or something and keeping me home seemed like a good idea for her. So that was my first disadvantage - I didn't get socialized with others in the early age.

Maybe because of that and because of what weirdo I just am, I got really really scared when it was time for the first school day. I mean yes it is stress for everybody, but it was like what someone of you would like to call an anxiety attack. I was always ok with strange adults, but the idea of being with kids I have never seen before (especially when majority of them were friends from kindergartens already) the whole thing caused me some real stress. Thankfully these were just my concerns and after all I made a good friend with one if the kids and I did just okay. 

What would come however, I could never imagine. My parents couldn't live together anymore and we (me and my brother) couldn't live with our dad. Not like he was beating us or anything like that. But you know... Smoking weed and dropping off work can be both financially intense hobbies.

In the middle of the 1st grade, the looooong series of moving, living in a shitholes and changing schools began. I literally changed school so many times that I can't even remember what all the schools were and how many exactly of them were in total. But I could easily count above 13. Every time coming to the new class of people, experiencing that anxiety attack as in the first school day. Also because being single mom is a hard job, we always lived in a literal shithole, with some matrassess usually on the floor, cheap very out-of-fashion clothes and I didn't even get my first cell phone until 8th grade. All of that didn't make the socializing much easier for me.

Also what I should probably mention is that I skipped the 3rd grade. Honestly I don't know how to put this so it does not look like bragging, but this will be important later on: I am a Mensa member with measured IQ of 143 and this and other factors lead my teachers and mom to conclusion that I should probably skip a grade, so I could get more from the education as 3rd grade stuff was too easy for me. That's nice and everything, but being not just a strange broke kid but also a one that is 1 or even 2 years younger from everyone else in the class - I hope you can imagine that. That caused me a first situations of being bullied.

Not until the 7th grade, where I of course changed the school again, but actually ended up in class with a bunch of very nice people. My mom promised us: ""This is the last time we are moving."" The relief was surreal. The people were actually so nice that I was out the whole day, enjoying company of my group and ended up getting my first fiancé. If anything, those were the best years of my life yet.

It is half through the 8th grade and guess what. Mom ran out of money (she btw stole that from our dad and it was a lot of money meant for ME and MY BROTHER personally for good grades) and we were moving. fucking. again. I just didn't know what to do. My mom even being a bitch she is, she gave me ultimatums like go or stay here but in a children's home. That's where the first sings of my issues started to show up.

Since there were not other things for me to do and since the world started to fall apart for me (we started living with our dad again at this point), I started to fall for video games. At that point and even now, I am not afraid to admit that I'm a video game addict. You could say ""man get a hobby, play some sport"" and I always wanted to. Actually I was very sporty kid in 1st and 2nd grade, regurairly running and having not only one of the best grades but also one of the best PE results among other kids. It was even my mom who first said that I could be a sporstman one day. But when she realised that I am also somehow intelectually gifted, she became too ambitious of me and REFUSED me to go and play some sport. (which was another seemingly weird thing about me as everyone in this country is pretty sports based)

When everything that holds me above a water at this points are video games and I feel less and less energised I wouldn't admit to myself that something was wrong, I just though to myself that I wad just probably getting hit by a puberty and that I was just sad. Because of being so addicted to games, I started missing school last year (1st grade in the middle school at this point). Of course my dad didn't like that at all and told me that he will either fully confiscate my PC or we will make a deal: I will go to school properly, I will be getting better grades and I can play all day I want. The choice was obvious.

Actually, that helped me unforeseemingly. Because there was something to push me forward like that, I didn't miss a single day in the school and my grades started to get really better for the upcoming month. I even started to play less as I was more interested in other things. But of course having that assurance that after a long day of school (I get off home by 5A.M. and come home by 5P.M.) I could get home and go relax with my online mates was very nice.

But because of what a fucking stoned jerk my dad was and still is, he FORGET (?!) about our deal and took my PC, fucking destroyed it to pieces while I was at school. I asked him what the fuck and that if we had a deal or not. He told me that he destroyed it because it was making a fan noises (which he should not care about since he shouldn't be in my room anyway) and that ""I shouldn't come on him with some deal bullcrap or anything like that"". Well I was shocked.

Since there was again nothing to keep going for, my mood started to get even progresivelly worse. I started to drop out of school even more and I started to notice that sometimes I would just lay in my bed, stare to the wall and think about all that shit and not have any energy to make anything other than that. That's when I started to be worried about myself.

Last week, we were with our mother for holiday and since I am a 15y.o. intelligent human being, I saw it as a good opportunity to talk to the only person I really trust and that was my mom.

So I started to tell her about the things that happened. (Including the moment, when I was preparing for the party we had in school in the 7th grade. I was really confident about myself as I had some really nice looking outfit in the long time and that I was suppossed to dance with my fiancé, which I was really hyped for. When I was dressing, I asked my mom if I should do my hair like this or that. She was like ""so that's how you're now"" and literally slapped me. So yeah that fucking ruined my confidence again and the whole evening for me. That probably again pissed her off and started to be rather annoyed, yet I just wanted to talk with clear heads). After that I told her that I don't feel very well in the past and I may be getting some mental health problems lately. She was like ""Depressions, depressions, come on"" and that was the end of the conversation.

That proved to me that my family isn't a good place to reach for things like that. But because of the situation, that was my last hope and I don't know what to do anymore and really I don't want to really. Whenever I though that I know what being hopeless is like, now I know it wasn't it. This is what it feels like. Even my chest feels hard when I try to think about what to do next. ",02Mar2019,27

I feel I have no control. It’s like I have to say yes to every single fear. I’ll read quotes on facing your fears and how beneficial it can be, and then misapply it to every stupid fear I have.

Another one said that he hadn't cried in an entire year, which he thought was very long. I then said that I haven't cried since I was twelve (I'm 18 now), and all my friends were kind of shocked. 

I was always taught that ""men don't cry"" ever since I was young, so I always saw it as a bad thing and avoided ever doing it in public or in private. Showing emotion in general was seen as a sign of weakness by my parents.

I won't act like there's no way it affected me as a person, because it definitely did. I have dealt with many mental problems like anxiety, depression and thoughts of suicide which I feel were largely caused by the fact that I was never taught how to deal with my emotions.

But then again, I thought that everyone was like this and never really felt that weird for never crying until now. So I'm here to ask, is it weird that I haven't cried in the past six years?",02Mar2019,2

3 days before I was born, my uncle and aunt adopted a kid. His name? Harry. That kinda put a spanner in the works, because we couldn't have two Harrys in the family, right? 

So my dad buys a book of boy's names, so that they can find some ideas. He opens it on the first page. The first name, on the first page, is Aaron. Guess what my name is? 

To be honest, it was a blessing in disguise - I went to secondary school right when Harry Potter was blowing up. I wore glasses and had medium-length dishevelled hair. They used to call me Harry Potter *anyway*; I can only imagine how bad it would have been if my name were actually Harry.

72,"So I just moved to Chicago from Seattle and I know very few people here besides work and my roommates. When I moved in I knew one was a pole dancer (we will call her lindsay), one was a massage therapist (Carol), and one was a manager of a wine bar (Allan). 

I then found out Lindsay was also a sex worker/ prostitute (surprise). When Allan found out, he gave three weeks notice and left. That was a very stressful time as Carol and Lindsay both aren't the best at conflict management, and tend to be aggressive. Lindsay threatened to steal Allan's things when he was leaving and would routinely wake him (and me) up in the middle of the night to yell at him.

We were able to replace him with a contortionist we will name Elise who is 19 and a student. Lindsay convinced Elise to start sex work and it has become a sad place since then. I found a new roommate and gave my months notice. 

Now Lindsay is upset I'm not staying through May, though I signed no lease agreement, and she is placing the burden of finding a new roommate on me, which I'm happy to do. 

Things are getting tough for me there and I'm worried they will try to steal my things in retaliation and will keep me awake when I need to go to work the next day.

78," I used to have another account on Reddit  when I was younger, where this creepy person from Quora (now permanently banned) kept doxxing me because she thought I was a Jew (I wish I was kidding). She was extremely obsessive and persistent and I was a minor (15 years old) at the time, and her profile pic looked like a creepy 50 year old woman, so she'd hijack my Reddit posts by replying with a dox post and replying to the people who commented on my threads with the dox post. I tried blocking him/her (I don't believe it was a woman for a second) but I found out as soon as I logged out I could see her dox posts again and that means everyone else could which defeats the purpose of blocking somebody.

She seemed hellbent on making me look bad, she had a blog dedicated to me which included photos of me and also the school I went to, and she asked inflammatory questions on Quora and then said that I posted them, when I didn't. She was also a Holocaust denier from what I remember. She tried to get me suspended from school by calling up the school, but the authorities quickly knew something fishy was going on and blocked her number.

She managed to find the website for my school because I included a blurry pic on my Quora account but she creepily used some kind of software to find matches on the internet and came across this virtual yearbook site and then started using my photo as her profile pic.

For creepos such as this, Reddit should implement a true blocking system and not the weak excuse for blocking it has now which is really just a muting system so you can't see someone's posts but everyone else can and they can spam up your threads even if they're blocked.

83,"I’m nearing spring break of my second semester at college. I’ve had ups and downs, but it’s been very rough. Around halfway through my first semester, I was hell bent on transferring to another nearby school. It was cheaper, and a lot bigger and somewhat nicer. The only thing was that it doesn’t have as nice of a reputation as where I’m going now.

I don’t really have friends at school. I have clubs I’m in, so I’m interacting with people there and in classes, but I don’t have people to hang out with or eat, minus one or two people. That being said, I do sometimes go to parties. I don’t have anyone to room with next year, and our school is small, so I’ll probably end up having to go random again. I don’t know what I’m going to do once I have to actually live off campus. I spend a lot of time alone, which I don’t usually mind, but it can get lonely on weekends or when I see people all hanging out.

So transferring is back on the table again, but I don’t even know if I want to do it. I do have people I’d miss if I left, as well as all of the groups I’m in. I honestly think the issue is me. I tried at the start of the school year to make friends, but at this point I’ve kind of given up. Everyone seems so solidified in their groups, and it’s not like the start where everyone felt fake or open to accept new people. I’m just afraid that I’ll transfer and find myself in the same situation, just in a different place. If that’s the case, I’d be back in the same boat as before, just with less groups and people I know, and it’d be tough to start again as a sophomore.

Meanwhile I feel like my family is pushing me to transfer. They keep saying “Oh don’t get mad if you don’t transfer and then don’t like the school you’re at. But *I’m not telling you what you should do*” I understand where they’re coming from, but I don’t know what I want.",02Mar2019,1

I guess that before I did have gay thoughts sometimes, and very rarely I sometimes had gay dreams, but I never really thought about it that much until the other day when I had another one of those gay dreams. I was so stressed about it that I asked a friend (female, who is actually bisexual) for help, and she told me that a friend of mine (best friend actually) was also going through the same thing and right after that I had a small crush on him that lasted a few days, but it was over quickly. Thing is, I didn't really want to like, do anything sexual with him, nor did I find him attractive at all. A few days after that ""crush"" ended, I started finding males attractive. Just out of nowhere, completely spontaneous. And like, when I find a male attractive I don't really wanna do anything with him like kiss him or just anything like that, unlike when it's with girls. Before all this I could obviously tell if a male was good-looking or not without being attracted to him at all. My attraction to girls is far greater than my ""attraction"" to boys, and like I said, looking at a pp never does leave me fully erect .

My Story: I am currently 16 years old in HS and I’ve been bullied since elementary and etc, recently ever since Hs I’ve been doing self improvement etc and just trying to make myself look better. I’m 5’3 so I’ve been trying to go to the doctor to fix my issues but my parents tell me that’s not important.
My dad is trying to get me to “be a man” and tries as hard as he can to enforce it, he tells me to do something that obviously doesn’t work and I tell him “how about we try it another way” etc and he gets mad and beats me.

As I said, I’m a really small guy so I try to get some clothes that fit me, regular jeans/pants don’t fit me so I suggested to my dad that he takes me to the mall for I can buy skinny jeans. He then told me of something among the lines of “You want something that’s all up in your ass so you can look like a queer nigga?”

I told him no.

A few weeks ago when I first got my hair braided into a man bun he called it a “bitch bun”

Today I got my ears Done and I got holes put in both of them, he’s not home so he tells me to send a picture, I do and a few minutes later he calls me and tells me to take out “that bitchass feminine gay shit” out of my ear and “I better not catch you wearing that shit to school on Monday or we are going to have a real problem.”

I don’t talk to my dad much about my issues because he gets mad and just tells me to lift weights, He was ranting at me about how I never talk to him about my issues and called me lazy for not doing anything about my height or hair “since I was being a bitch and complained about it to much” and I told him that I don’t talk to him about my issues because he gets mad and tells meI should do etc, I told him that I don’t talk to him about my height because one time he told me “One ear out the other because I don’t give a damn.”, I repeated his word to him on the phone and he corrected me to “I don’t give a fuck”.

I know my dad wants me to be successful etc but I don’t know where all this anger and aggression is coming from, he wants me to do sports and I told him that I would but’s it going to be significantly harder since I have the height of a middle schooler and he told me to shut the fuck up, stop being a bitch.

He tells me to stop letting other people determine how I feel about how Or what I look like.

He then told me that he wants to see me at “X” Sport game where he can watch me from the bench and tell other people “Hey you see that guy?, he’s MY son.”

He also wants me to start sending him checks over 1k after I’m in my twenties and he’s retired, I understand that but how come you haven’t included mom or any other of our family members in the picture.

For example, if I do something that makes my girlfriend a little bit jealous and it shows, I immediately feel incredibly guilty and want to cry and apologize up the wazoo. I'm dead serious; having any partner of mine be upset at me (no matter how much) is one of my biggest triggers for an anxiety attack.

Another example is the fact that I'm so self-aware/self-conscious, that I cannot socialize and make new friends for the life of me. I'm not a talker and incredibly introverted and it not only makes it difficult to make new friends and meet new people but also *keep* the friendships I already have (and there are not a lot of them; about 3. And they don't live near me).

The best advice I have given myself is to stop giving such a shit. It really is that simple.
