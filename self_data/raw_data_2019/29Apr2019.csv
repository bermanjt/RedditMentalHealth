0,"Last night I went to a concert with my friend, it was their first show. Two of the band members are famous actors from a really popular show so I was excited. At the end we got to meet them and take pictures with them. When I got home I posted pictures I took of them on stage and tagged them in my instagram story and two of them got reposted on stories, one by the band page and one by the lead singer. Then the guitarist dmed me and said I hope you enjoyed the show (he wasn’t one of the actors), and I was so happy that one of the band members was actually talking to me.

Then he told me to send a photo of myself and he told me they were partying at this hotel and that I should come. I was an hour away and he said it was fine they were still drinking so and I felt like I was in a movie. Like I was actually going to hang out with celebrities who I’ve been a fan of for years. I got to the hotel and the guitarist started making out with me right outside the hotel. I didn’t want it to happen but I just wanted to see everyone else so I decided to just go along with it but it was just gross. Then we got to the hotel room and everyone else was just sleeping in the bed. He took me into the bathroom and everything happened so fast and I felt like I couldn’t leave and we didn’t have sex but everything he did hurt and I was crying when he couldn’t see my face and I did stuff too that I don’t want to name and I stopped him before we actually had sex. I never actually said yes but it doesn't matter. He also slapped me in the face and hit me without warning. 

I just said I’m sorry but I want to leave. He didnt listen the first time and then he did the second time. He didn’t help me or anything or say goodbye he just opened the door and left me out in this hotel in this city that I’ve only been to once in the middle of the night. I just feel so stupid and so violated.

I feel like I’ve been assaulted even though I knew I wasn’t because I let it happen but I didn’t want it to happen at all and everything was just so disgusting and I’m just so depressed now. I can’t stop crying and I hate that I can’t do anything about it because this was my first sexual encounter other than my last one which was when I was actually molested. But this feels so so much worse. I just don’t know what to do I just feel so dumb. I don’t even know how old he was or anything about him.",29Apr2019,1

2,Currently on vacation in a southamerican beach city. We are in an airbnb room rented from the nicest and I mean THE nicest couple ever. The lady baked us a cake and we were all chatting and playing with the dogs. Because of the nice dogs the subject was pets and I told I have a bird and she told us the story of how their parrot died. In short : he fell in a pan of hot oil. Why in the fucking hell you awful lady had to tell us that fucking sad story. Parrots are so loving and cute. I didn't cry at the moment but noW I am. Go pet your pets for me please. Now.,29Apr2019,1

There are other reasons I'm lacking in intelligence but the main thing is that the older I age, the worse it gets. Which would be fine if I wasn't already dumber than a box of blown fuses.

5,"So, first time for me here. It's strange to be the one writings things for once but I just feel like it right now. Hell, I don't even know if I'm the right subreddit right now but let's get along with it. So I finished high school last year and after that I just took a year off to realize what I wanted to do with my life. In the meantime I sent some CVs around but I knew I wasn't gonna be hired so I just enjoyed my time. Last October my sister showed me a project about an internship my district was gonna plan in some European countries. As soon as I saw the project, I agreed. I felt useless at home doing nothing and finally I had an opportunity that could help mature and even make some money out of it. So after some meetings with the directors of all this project I'm finally taking the flight and I'll be there for 5 months alone. I'm renting a room in a old lady's house and I feel like she's gonna be the only one I will talk to outside my colleagues. I just feel anxious and worried because that's my first real experience alone. I stayed weeks without my family before but now that I'm also without my friends I feel a little lost. I also feel a little dumb to be bitching about being alone at 20 yo but I can't help it. Deep down I know it will be a good experience that will teach me the value of money (since I will be given an allowance monthly for my rent and living expenses) and also the value of independence. I feel so conflicted.",29Apr2019,1
6,"Hey everyone, this is my first time posting to reddit despite browsing it for quite some time. Felt this would be a good place to get this off my chest. I’m not looking for pity, I just want to see if there’s anyone out there who can relate to me and possibly open my eyes up to something.

 So I’m 18, I have a full time job that pays me pretty well compared to my other friends or anyone else I know around my age. As of recently I have been dating a wonderful girl who hasn’t shown any red flags of being overly clingy/controlling. I used to have a handful of friends that I would spend much time with but until about a month ago I separated myself from most of them (they’re not very good people and it was after I made a realization of who they are and what their influences were on me compared to the man I want to become) and now I only talk to a few people and only spend time with two of them. 

  Now that we got that out of the way, I can start explaining why I’m posting here. At the end of each day (sometimes earlier depending on how busy I am) I begin to feel sad and almost a sort of “lonely” feeling. And feeling like this leads to very strange thoughts that usually involve something bad happening to me like a car accident or some other type of serious injury that can be fatal. This leads me to so much confusion because during the better parts of my day, I’m ambitious and always looking forward to the future and what I believe I can potentially do but later on in the day my thoughts completely change from positivity to negativity and I think it’s best to describe it as a “fuck this, fuck everything” feeling that makes you question everything and ask yourself if it’s worth the effort to go on. 

 I don’t think it would be right to fully say I’m alone because my family loves me and so do the very few friends I have but I still feel lonely beyond what words can describe and it really sucks. Does this make me crazy? I’d like to hear what y’all think and if you have gone through the same thing. I would never feel comfortable with people who know me personally having any knowledge of this.",29Apr2019,1

8,"I don’t want to drink anymore.

I have a lot of self control when it comes to drinking. I definitely got a lot of my want to drink out of my system a couple years ago during my early college years. I’m glad I had those crazy drunken nights, but I never want to be that person again. 

The older I’ve gotten the more I’ve learned that I simply don’t like it. I don’t like the way it makes me feel or how much money it costs. I enjoy going out and being with people, but I don’t like who I am when I’m drunk. 

The only thing that’s been holding me back is the social aspect of drinking, which seems to be engrained in the environment Im surrounded by. I’ve never felt pressure to drink like I do now, and I’m an adult. Maybe it’s just my environment, but I wish there were other ways to be young and single and meet people that didn’t involve getting intoxicated. 

I don’t think I’ll completely cut it out of my life, I just think it’ll be a lot lot less casual than it is now. I don’t want to tell any of my friends yet so here I am! I’m done drinking!",29Apr2019,59

12,"Im a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it so idk. Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way but she’s started off really snotty with me that day it also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly but I took it as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence and I worried she hated me for it",29Apr2019,0
13,"This is my first post on reddit,.. don’t really know where to put this post but it’s about myself so I guess self???

I’m 24 F and I’ve always been a pretty good kid, got good grades and cared about school. I love my mom and am forever indebted to her for raising me the way she did. My dad, whom I still deeply care for was once probably my more favorite parent but in the last few years has really just become a shell of himself. He lost everything in the stock market crash in 09 and pretty much never recovered. He is short tempered with everyone, has held a knife up to my mom, and gave my sister a black eye, attempted to commit suicide/make a video, threatened to burn the house down... etc. but he has gotten a litttttle better and is usually normal for the most part but if he is triggered he  can go apeshit.  He is pretty much a leech because he has been unemployed for the last few years and basically gets super touchy when we bring up anything about money BUT basically my mom will never leave him and he does really love us and is always open to listening to our problems, I just think the stock market crash really fucked him up in the head and he is super sensitive about it.


I am also married, I got married a year ago (when I was 23) to the love of my life and I know I’m pretty young but it kind of was a whirlwind of a time. I seriously love him so much but he always jokes sometimes that he’ll never go hungry because he is married to me, he believes that I can basically carry him financially but that puts a lot of strain on me because I am pretty exhausted from working so much and I feel like I can’t stop because I don’t want to let anyone down. I’ve told him before that it stressed me out when he says that and he’s said sorry, but I know that he has so much faith in my abilities but I’m afraid I can’t keep it up forever.

I graduated last May and I have been working since. I make good money (however I freelance, so money may be inconsistent but so far it’s been okay) but I’ve come to realize that it’s not something I do for passion but I’m ok with just doing it for the sake of money. 

DESPITE not being super passionate, I still constantly search my Peers on LinkedIn because I want to know how I am comparing. I don’t know why but I measure success in employment or something but I know it’s a horrible thing and I’m trying to lay off. I don’t really know what my deal is but I just feel like I’m a phony that just somehow things worked out for but at the same time I don’t want people to think that I’m undeserving of this life.

Im constantly fighting the feeling of wanting more (though I’m certain I will never be happy where I am in life) and being disappointed in myself for even thinking about wanting to expand my life experience when I have everything I need in front of me. I don’t have anything exciting stories in my life to share with my friends or haven’t I really travelled anywhere and although I’ve been through some weird trauma of my own, my life is really great.

So I feel extremely guilty saying this because I know even my own (older) sister constantly reminds me that I’m so lucky to have a husband and a job and basically this life. Which is all true. But I get pretty envious when people have things to say about their crazy drunken stories or night out with friends that turned into an adventure. I guess I am just afraid that I am a boring person. 

All I do these days is sleep eat and work and maybe watch shows if work doesn’t drag on too late. I’ve never been the type to go out to parties/drink or stay out too late and I also have this thing (not sure if it counts as social anxiety or what) but I hate making plans because sometimes the thought of going out, driving somewhere, or socializing makes me stressed.

And my friend even brought to my attention that whenever I talk about something in my life it has a sad ending while everyone else seems to get a good laugh out of some silly story. For some reason my mind really remembers a lot of the bad or sad shit because I KNOW I have fun but I only seem to remember the times I was sad or something.

I don’t really know what I need or want to feel like this life is worth living, and I’m not suicidal by any means ( though I’ve cut myself as a teenager and I battled bulimia for about 3 years in the past) and I am happy for the most part. But some days I’ll just feel like I have no hobbies, no fun stories, no character and i don’t really know what to do at this point. It seems like every milestone I’ve hit in life seems to be overshadowed the next and I will never be enough..????

Can anyone give me any advice, thoughts, or peace of mind or relatability?

Thank you for making it to the end.

TLDR: Was always a good kid and life is almost too good to be true but feels lost and undeserving at times",29Apr2019,1
14,"I live in CA and not going to lie I have a pretty well off family. Its just I dont really do anything to contribute to society or really to my parents either.

I spend a lot of time alone and I dont have many friends, and my social skills seem to be here and there.

26,"my parents are very traditional christians, not the most accepting people in the world. once i realized i was gay, i had to keep my personal life on the dl from them, especially when i had girlfriends throughout high school. 

i have amazing friends with amazing families who know more about me than my family does. since i’ve never had a parental figure to talk about my sexuality and identity with, i confide in the parents of my friends. they’ve all told me that i would have a safe place to stay if i were to ever have difficulties with my family regarding my sexuality. i’ve been with my current girlfriend for about a year now and her family is just as accepting and loving. 

i’ve definitely noticed the distance between my family and i now. i’m sure they suspect i’m gay by now, and they know i’m no longer christian or have the same beliefs and morals as them. they don’t even really know how to talk to me at this point, and this has honestly been really hard for me to come to terms with. 

if i ever get married, most of my family won’t be there. they’ve very clearly shared their opinions on gay people. ive yet to come out to a majority of my family (including my non-immediate family), mainly out of fear. that broke my heart when i realized this as a kid, but i’m so happy to have all of my friends and their families that have shown me so much love. i’d rather see their proud faces in the crowd than the faces of disappointed blood relatives, anyways.

27,"I broke down at work today. I started crying and could not stop for almost an hour. I'm still embarrassed about it. I've been so sad lately and I'm just hurt. I've been trying to be optimistic but I've just been feeling like all my attempts to improve my situation have failed. I feel alone and hopeless all the time. 

Being homeless is exhausting. When I can't afford a hotel, I can't really sleep because it's cold at night and I'm afraid someone might try to attack me. I'm stressed all the time because hoping things will get better soon is exhausting. Working exhausts me. Pretending to have faith that something will work out is exhausting. I'm always trying and pretending to be happy and that's exhausting. I don't like myself and trying to remember why I used to like myself is exhausting.

Today on my way to work a customer stopped me and asked me if I'm homeless. I just didn't have the energy to lie so I said yes. He walked with me and asked me what happened and we talked for a few minutes and then he propositioned me. He said he lives by himself and if I was willing to give him a chance I could live with him. I said no thank you and I don't know why but that just really hurt me.


I was on the verge of tears when I got to work.  I was trying to hold it together but then I sent gas to the wrong pump for a customer and someone basically stole their gas and they were understandably furious with me. They yelled at me and when they walked out I couldn't hold it in anymore. I cried and couldn't stop.

I had to go into the office. I did this in front of my boss, my coworkers and customers. I had to go into the back office. Eventually one of my coworkers came in and asked if I was okay. I said no. She asked why and it all came out. I told her about my ex beating me, no one believing me, being homeless, thinking that I had found an apartment and not being able to get it, not being able to find a second job, and the customer telling me that if I had sex with him I could live with him.

I felt bad because she's 19 and I just laid all this on her.  And she's polite but we're not friends. And I felt like she must be judging  me for being a grown woman and being homeless. Then she cried too. And she said she had heard I was homeless and thought so because I got mail at the store the other day. Her crying and knowing about me being homeless made me feel worse. I comforted her and stopped crying and came back onto the floor and apologized and got back to work.

Before we got off my coworker told me she had talked to her mom and her mom said that I can stay in their guest room if I pay her until I find somewhere to live. She said her mom can be a lot to deal with but she said she talked to her about how cold it gets at night and me leaving my ex and her mom said I can stay there but I have to pay her and she wanted to speak with me.

Maybe I should have said no but I'm so tired of being homeless. I talked with her mom and apparently my coworker's friends have stayed with her without paying so she's understandably adamant about being paid. She said I have to buy my own food and  clean after myself and keep a job and I can't stay there forever. That's more than reasonable to me. She asked if I can pay her today but I won't get paid until Wednesday so she said that's when I can £~@move in.

Anyway it really kind of reminded me of my time in the military when disturbances like this would happen basically on a daily basis... Except there YOU were the firefighter most of the time.  And if not it was some sort of totally bullshit and unreasonable inspection or something stupid.  And I really didn't mind it but, at the same time, I was/am quite pissed off.  Does the alarm *really* need to be that obnoxious? I think I might have hearing loss because of it.  And I mean it can take a while for you to decompress, mentally, let's say, from something like this, and I can't just go right straight back to bed.  My brain is like nah man fuck your sleep I gotta *think* about this shit for six fucking hours!  It's flight time it's not time for bed you gotta survive this inherent existential threat!  And I'm like, no... Just let me go to bed you dick the fire alarm is over.

Surprising the wildlife you see in an urban environment every now and then.  But the weird thing about it was that I didn't feel in danger, like at all, and I normally would since it's night and there's a lot of crime in this neighborhood.  Idk.  I can fight, lol, idc.  You try to mug me you ain't getting much.  


I really didn't want to run into my neighbors or anyone I knew, though, I hate that.  And thankfully I didnt.  That's why I went for the walk.  


I lead a very exciting life, you guys.  Yup.  Lol.  Christ...",29Apr2019,3
32,"I'm not sure where to post this exactly but I just need to talk.

Basically I went through a traumatic breakup. The break up was traumatic because I really thought that me and this person were going to be together forever. But then he left me for another girl. Never gave me an explanation and I think that's what hurts the most. We were bestfriends and I could not comprehend why he refused tell me the reason for our break up. Being left in the cold sucked. 

I fell into a huge depression and tried to find comfort in new relationships. Theres 3 guys that I met during this time period.

Guy A : We had a one night stand, didn't hear from him for months and eventually became a friends with benefits situation. I wasn't too comfortable with this arrangement due to him being shut off emotionally. 

Guy B : I was not too fond of him in the beginning. After a few dates,I developed a soft spot towards him and we dated for a couple of months.

Guy C : This one makes me so upset. I really liked him and we got along so well that it was insane. He ended up ghosting me. Although he messaged me months later asking for sex.

I tried to make those short because I could write a whole book about this. Anyways, I was tired of having my self esteem thrown down the drain. I'm not the best looking girl but I'm definitely no prom queen. I like to think that I have a nice personality. So it never made sense why everyone kept leaving me and then coming back. One day, I decided that enough was enough and started to work on myself and I've done great. But just this past week, I've had all three guys hit me up out of the blue. 

I'm living with what I did and moving forward but it hurts that all I'll ever been seen by them is a booty call. I am better off though.

33,"The first thing my therapist ever did for me was tell me to come up with three good things about myself and three thinks that made me happy. The task seemed impossible - I felt  worthless and hollow.

Fast forward six years and I’m getting married to the most intelligent and nurturing woman I have ever known. I get told I’m gorgeous and I make side money by modeling. I have a new well-paying job I’m very good at that helps people and involves playing with dogs.

I love my high cheekbones and my fluffy hair and the gap in my smile. Writing, archery, and anything pastel makes me happy.

I genuinely want to keep living. After what I went through there didn’t seem to be anything left but with perseverance, professional psychiatric  and medical help, and the support of my fiancée and her family. I’m become a whole woman like I’ve never been before.

35,I feel like I'm always negative. Always judging others (usually only in my mind). I'm not sure people actually like being around me. It's not like I think highly of myself at all. I have low self- esteem and low confidence that I'm slowly trying to work on. I don't really know when this started; maybe I've always been this critical of others. I do know that I don't like it and I want to change. I want to be a genuinely nice person and I just want to love and help people. I just don't know where to start.

39,"Recently I’ve just felt so down. I am in my junior year of high school, the most important year, and boy am I fucking it up. My mother gets on my case every single day about it too, but that’s only the start. To make things worse, I’ve gained 20-25 lbs, which makes me feel even more insecure and self hating. 

For some extra story, I am usually the fun loving comic. I never hesitate to make people laugh, or make people feel better when they’re down. I am usually never nasty to people, and if I needed to hate somebody, it would be myself. This year, I’ve begun to notice how my friendships are such a bad investment. I put time, money, and emotional effort into them, I try so hard, and I just get nothing back. I’ll always be there for them, but I can’t say the same if the situation was reversed. My grades have been down the toilet—my most important year, and here I am fucking it up. I am in a horrible cycle of eating, working a terrible job, and then repeating. I recently decided to give up in school, because no matter how hard I study, or how long I do work, I don’t get the grades. So what’s the point? Right? 

Due to these grades, my mother, who used to see me as an Ivy League kid, degrades me about such grades every day. Literally every time she opens her mouth, it’s something nasty about my underperformance. It makes me sick. This has caused numerous fights between us (verbally, I would never raise a hand to my mother), and now whenever she speaks I just get mad. I notice the same with some of my friends, those same ones who put in such little effort to our friendships. Now I’m worried I won’t even make it into any decent colleges. I always procrastinate and find myself now extremely lazy. Many times, find myself cramming for 1 hour Sunday night for a Monday morning test, to get a D or a C. Only 2 years ago I was happier, thinner, and more hard working. Now when I look in the mirror I become disgusted. I hate myself and everything around me. 

Another factor is the competition around me. I’m always being compared to other students and my twin brother. Recently, he was inducted into the National Honors Society, while I was not. Such an event would seem quite minimal for me, but to those around me, it’s everything. I feel myself slipping, I am just seen as lesser now and I know it. 

Many people will see this as a moody teen post, but it’s really not. I just need help, or tips on how to help myself. What kind of kid abhors his own mother? I’m truly disgusted with my being and I resent the fact that I can’t change myself.",29Apr2019,0

42,"Greetings.

I've considered posting here in multiple occasions. This will be my first time.

A little about myself, I will be 26 in a few months. I live in a small town, in the desert. Dead end job, still live with the folks, the usual small-town story. Single, but... that feels like a more inaccurate description. ""Exiled"" feels more correct. We have lived here for... almost 18 years. 

In that time, I have never been accepted by any particular group of people my own age.

... And I don't know why.

I've always held myself to a high standard of self refinement. I've always believed in self hygiene, I am always clean and well trimmed. Even on the particularly hot days of summer, or when doing hard-labor types of work. I've always felt appearance is a great first impression.

I made a few friends here and there, but they've all moved on. I'm glad they've made it out. I hope my time is soon. 

When I do see people I knew from school, or from other places, generally they don't talk long, if at all. Many are busy, it takes much to be successful in a small town like this. Even when they do have time for leisure, that time is  never made for me. Many don't even speak. Many just turn their eyes to the ground and walk away when they see me. 

I've spent a lot of time on my own, otherwise saying. I had a girlfriend once, a long while ago. It was nice, until it wasn't. We grew in separate directions. That sorta thing seems to happen sometimes. That was 6 years ago.

The thing I miss most about it? Simple. The validation. Being recognized as a human being, not just a cog in some workforce machine. Although the intimacy, the openness of emotion, the honesty, are all very close contenders. 

I broke up with her. I was becoming more active, and she was becoming more inert. I felt like I was putting more effort into the relationship than she was, too. There was much discussion. I put much into rekindling what we had months prior. 

It was not meant to be, sadly.

It lead to a feeling. Like getting up and running. An impulse. It led to a half- decade of self discovery. I found many new interests, many new hobbies. Many great things I'd like to share with someone one day.

But today is not that day. My current objective is trying to move. Trying to figure out how to save enough money to move, especially in the desert, which degrades your vehicle, degrades electronics, and covers everything in a thick layer of dust. 

There is still hope. Hope for everything. 

Today I started typing this because... I feel that same impulse as I did 6 years ago. And I have no idea what to do with it.

I feel like I've turned myself into a very refined person. I feel like I am more interesting and complex than I was a decade ago. Yet, I feel like I have failed socially, and from a societal standpoint. I wake up, work, come home sleep. Pretty much it these days. My job is great from a social standpoint. I meet tons of people, but never from around here. Always just passing through. Pay is mediocre though. I took it because pay was better than the last. The only major difference though, is that this one is ""Full time."" I work 5 days a week, which is actually pretty nice, as it gives me two steady days to explore, or work on my hobbies or interests.  I want to meet people, new people, especially in my own age group, so I began inquiring as to where people in my age group hang out. so far it's a wash. Nobody knows?

Perhaps improving my social skills will have to wait for another day.

It's been a long time since I could really vent out my thought stream to anyone, so thank you for reading, or listening, if you read this in a voice.",29Apr2019,1
43,"Last year I was at my lowest point.  I had severe depression, social anxiety, and out of hand drug use. I failed every class besides one, and my grade for that class wasn't the best either.

I took a whole year off and got my shit back together.  I went to therapy for mainly my social anxiety, which had gotten to a debilitating point.  I luckily struck gold with a proactive therapist who did his best to help me get better.  

I've been mostly sober for a year and almost 4 months, I have a job, I'm going back to college, and I can do so many more social things than I could 7 months ago.  Before, I couldn't go through a checkout line in a grocery store, now I can go through almost anything in a social setting.  I wouldn't even consider myself depressed.

I'm just genuinely so proud of the progress I've made in under a year.  It really hit home when I made an A on my last final, which solidifies a 4.0 for the semester.  

If any of you are struggling, know that it can get better.  I thought I couldn't get better, that it wasn't possible.  I was wrong.  It takes baby steps, but once you gain momentum, it gets so much easier.  Just stick with it!",29Apr2019,87

49,"When I was allot younger aged 11 (I’m 27 now) I met this girl at my school who I really cared about but didn’t have the guts to tell her until a few years later we will call her Amy.

Flash forward a few years and I asked her to introduce me to a friend of hers and the whole night of talking to this girl I knew that she was not interested in me at all they spoke a different language that I didn’t understand at the time but I wanted to be respectful and talked  to Amy and told her that her friend was clearly not into me so I’ll buy the last drinks and walk you guys home.

Walking home Amy admitted that she liked me and wanted her friend to come “check me out first” but later that night I asked her out we kissed the whole “will you go out with me” shit.

The first year was amazing I saw new places did new things tried new foods the works.

Then the following years I started to see the true controlling side of Amy that I could have never imagined before we stared dating.

She told me I couldn’t talk to girls (who I had been friends with for years) 

She threw things at me 

She would get angry over the smallest things 

I understand everyone has there issues but I loved her and I just wanted her.

I always worry about things and this really affects my self-confidence and I get upset over the smallest things at this point (we had been dating around 4 years at this point)

Then she would go out more often having an argument with me because I had to work the next day and didn’t really want to go out every weekend.

I would go out my way to help her all of the time.

I try to be a pretty independent person so I don’t really ask for much help but when I ask for help people are generally surprised.

We are about 6years I’m at this point

The arguments are nearly everyday, I’m going to the doctor with my health because I worry so much. 

She tells me all the time she is going to leave me

That I’m worthless and I’ll never become anything in my pathetic life.

I’ve now lost all of my friends I grew up with because of her

I tired to reach out to people but they just are not interested making plans with them and then just not showing up 

8years in she tells me that she is going back to uni so this is over 

She just ended it like it meant nothing 

Growing up together and an 8 year relationship over just like that 

She takes half of our stuff demands that I pay her for some things that were MINE 

But I agree so I didn’t make this any harder 

I was destroyed I didn’t know what to do threw all the abuse, arguing and lost friendships I still just wanted her 

I know dumb move 

At this point I’ve never felt so low in my life I tired talking to my family but they didn’t seem interested at all and I had no one I could talk too because I had no friends 

I JUST WANTED TO DIE 

For around 1 year she was telling me that we would get back together  but I believed her (stupid move)

I really needed to get my life back on track 

My worrying was affecting my job I’d worry about losing my job it was a horrible loop 

Move forward another 6months (hadn’t spoken to Amy in around 10months now)

I went on a run with this crappy old phone but that crappy old phone saved my life 

For some reason I left my phone unlocked when I got home from this run in my pocket (after leaving Facebook open) I saw that Pam has accepted my friend request 

I didn’t know who this girl was at all I don’t even know how this shit happened

But we got talking and agreed to meet for a coffee 

(Enter Amy via text)

“So how did your date go with Pam”

“Amy how do you even know about this”

“I have people I now you met her why did you meet her”

“I just met a friend now of your business please leave me alone”


(Amy texts me tells me she wants to meet)

I agree and she tells me she wants to take me back and she’s sorry for everything and I don’t no what came over me but I said no and walked away 

I work allot at this point and I ask Pam out on another date 

She agrees and we have a great time like I think I can actually start to get my life together again 

(Amy is back again)

“Why do you keep going out with this girl she is not interested in you your nothing your worthless you can’t cook to save your life”

(Pam is in uni at this point and has allot of free time)

Pam was going away with her friends travelling through Europe 

(We are still not official at this point)

I agree that I could meet her at some point in her travels in Rome 

So we meet and we make it official in Rome 

Amy then messages Pam begging her to give me back to her and that Pam was nothing but a phase 

I tell her to ignore her and let’s just move forward 

I get back to my parents from Rome (I had a few days before I needed to  go back to work)

To find Amy on her knees begging me to take her back 

I just told her no and that I though she said I was nothing and worthless and would never do anything with my life 

SHE BROKE DOWN 

Finally she understood what it felt like to have your heart broken like the way mine was.

Come to the present day I moved to Asia with my now wife Pam and I’m legit living my dream 

I have tried to reach out to friends that I have lost but they are more interested now in how much money I make what a nice house I have and a nice car and just want a slice of the pie so to the people that said I was nothing Fuck you and have a nice day

You have to be assertive, almost masculine to get ahead and this called a bitch or an asshole. You sometimes have to step on people and this is a reality that women are now realizing and getting offended when they are called a bitch for doing it. This has been something that makes have felt with forever and it’s expected that one in a position of power will be an asshole and thus not really called a name because it’s expected.

56,"There are a lot of things I don’t understand about myself. I annoy myself to no end. I’m tired of being with myself 24/7. It’s draining. But that’s besides my main point. (Kind of.) 

I have a boyfriend. I love him. We’ve been together for over a year now, but for some reason I’m still shy around him. Not only that, but I have this mentality where I feel like I don’t deserve anything. This makes it hard for me to ask for things that a girlfriend would ask of their boyfriend. 

For example, I feel bad whenever I seek his attention. I feel like even though he’s my boyfriend, I don’t deserve attention. There are times when I want to send him a bunch of selfies and intimate pictures but I tell myself things like, “Oh stop acting like you’re confident and like you’re hot shit.” And I end up belittling myself and talking myself out of doing things like that because I don’t feel good enough. 

There are also times where I want to get intimate with him, but too shy to say anything or initiate anything. I also suck at flirting even when I’m already in a relationship with him. I honestly feel so pathetic and I actually cry about this stuff quite often lol. 

I just seem to do this thing where I ignore my needs and desires and tell others, “Oh no it’s okay. You don’t HAVE to do that for me..” even though I REALLY want that thing. Another example is the fact that we’re in a long distance relationship and he’s coming to see me in 20 days. He’ll be flying in a plane and he’s terrified of heights and has social anxiety. Every now and then since the day he actually comes sees me is approaching, he’ll tell me how he’s feeling scared and anxious about the trip. I end up feeling bad and I tell him, “It’s okay, you don’t have to come see me.” And I truly honestly do feel that way. I just don’t think I’m good enough of a person and girlfriend.. like he shouldn’t have to go through all that uncomfortableness and fear to see someone like me when I’m not worth it. Like I mentioned earlier, I’m still shy around him when it comes to asking him for things as a gf.. like affection, kisses, pictures, etc. and because of that, I’m not as expressive as a lot of gfs are. 

I just feel like I’m always in this vicious cycle of me not feeling good enough for him and not feeling deserving of anything. He constantly reminds me that I don’t seem to be taking advantage of the fact that I’m a gf.. He reminds me that I can just ask for kisses whenever I want and that I can ask him for anything because he’s my bf... but the feeling of not being good enough and all the other reasons I explained seem to constantly interfere.. I’m not lying when I say that I feel like I’m going crazy because of this.

Like, how is it that having a bf/life partner is such a beautiful thing because you have this person to count on and they’re your trusty source of love and attention but you can’t even fully and comfortably get those things because of all these factors? 

I really hope this makes sense to at least one person.. I honestly feel so alone and I wish I could stop feeling like I’m not deserving of these things.. I just want to enjoy him, our life, and the love we can share..",29Apr2019,16

62,"do you sometimes have the same brain problems like I’ll describe now?:

&amp;#x200B;

like I search and search and search then I give up embarrassed and ask „where is the scissors“ the other person says that it’s right there in front of me. So I’m embarrassed and the other person thinks what a goddamn retard I must be.

&amp;#x200B;

I already checked myself as much as I was able to check myself (different online tests. for example iq tests). All tests said I’m mentally really healthy and my iq must be 133.

&amp;#x200B;

I think if I have a test score of iq=133 it does not make me generally smart. First of all I have a couple of advantages in these types of tests. I have to write programs sometimes so if I program a machine I first have to realize how I think myself, how I solve a certain problem in my mind myself before I’m able to teach a machine how to do that in detail with an algorithm. Also I'm a student so I’m well aware of lots of mathematical rules and patterns that really really help in tests like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Also the iq test does not contain things I can NOT do. Like drawing well or reading fast / learning new information. It tests if you are able to make conclusions based on information given.

&amp;#x200B;

Another random example when I usually feel like a dummy is if I go to the basement to get something what lays on the deep-freezer. So I go there and habit-wise I grab a pizza and put it in the oven. Then I realize I’m not even hungry and I went into the basement for a totally different purpose.

&amp;#x200B;

Often times I don’t understand jokes or can’t follow a conversation. When I read a text that has complex information in it it feels like it overtasks my brain and I have to repeat it several times so I can even PROCESS the information in it. At the same time other students process it right away and never have to go back. When I write something I don’t really have a structure. When I am giving a presentation or speak in general and I didn’t take any notes with me on purpose (so it feels more natural for the listener) then I always have no plan what’s my goal when I start my sentences and I end up in a impasse totally embarrassing myself. When I write some text on english, like now, I sometimes have to look up certain words that I have just looked up multiple times recently.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents really had a hard time teaching me how to clean my nose when I was 3. Then the same with tying my shoes when I was 5 to 6, use a scissor when I was 6, ride a bike when I was 7 and drive a car when I was 18. I was always the last.

I had what i THINK was a minor panic attack but at the very least was an illogical adult tantrum today and i dont know where to go. I called out of work and went on a long walk. My family is not abusive physically and not on purpose emotionally. My mother is constantly worried about the youngest sibling because she is a dificult child with intense anxiety bit she also manipulates my mother to get her way. For example. She refused to go to school so my mother enroled her in an online class. She gets on her computer and does nothing but watcg youtube or get on instagram. Then my mom goes in her room to see this. It will always escalate into a yelling match with my mom crying and my sister getting back on youtube and yelling that she wants to be left alomt to anybody who goes too close. I know she has issues. But how can anybody treat their mother who has sacraficed so much for them like that. My mother is always heartbroken and tured i see it every day. All i can do is lock myself in my room because when i try to come out and calm things down they both yell at me then my mother comes to her defense. I hewr and see my mom cry and call herself a terrible mother almost every day. Nothing i say or do makes her feel better. But my mother contributes to the problem too. I have memories for as long as i can remember of getting into yelling matches multiple times a day with my mother over the absolutely trivial. While my mother isnt perfect she is definitely the victum. I cant take it anymore i lusten to the fights many times a day. I feel emotionally drained in every way. I am powerless in this house. I really just needed to get the fact that i cant get stuff off my chest off my chest.


The literal only good quality i have right now is that i am a good worker. I have a retail job and i am well liked by customers and co workers. And i work with and for great people. I love my job but it just doesnt pay well enough for me to make it my career. I cant move out on that pay. It is even probably the best job a person could get in thiw city without a degree. You have to bust your tail but i take pride in my work and make my own fun at work even if most customers dont appreciate how much i try to the best i possibly can. Its the only thing i can take pride in in my life. So i make it count. Work is the place i can impress people. When you put me on a section it will be jigher quality work and done faster then if you assigned it to anybody else. I have made sure of that.

Thats not even half of whats wrong with me. On top of all this. I am no longer in school i just cant keep up with all the homework. I havent gotten a drivers lisence. Eben though im a full ass adult now. And i just have no idea what to do with my life in general. I need a purpose i can work toqards and someone i can tell tjings like this to and cry in front of. If i could have anything i would just have someone i could be 100% real with right now. How can i have people who are here for me but not at the same time.",29Apr2019,2

65,"This isn't r/confession material since some of my friends actually know about him.

I had Dolphino since I was a little boy. He's pretty big, not gonna lie. He was just a tad smaller than me as a toddler. My best friend even used to have a girl version of him which I called Dolphina. 

Now that I'm a grown up, working adult, I still cuddle with him before I sleep. I tend to just be normal and laidback with people, but still having him as my cuddle buddy can be weird. 

The only times I'll be unable to cuddle with him, is if I have to sleep over at another house or I'm doing some traveling. I occasionally do have times where I have to give him a ''bath''. 

I feel protective of him because he has been with me my whole life. He's the cutest companion that I have had in my life. He makes me happy when I'm down and he's a great pillow too. He also makes me like cuddles, and that's why I like cuddling. :)

My friends (and even an ex-girlfriend) know about him and they do find it weird. But then he's just special to me. 

Dolphino is the cutest dolphin and I'm proud of him.

Their response was: “Give the phone to us and we’ll do the work for you”,but I couldn’t do that either. After 2 good hours of trying, they whispered something to eachother, more like they planned something up. My best friend told me that I have disappointed him and he won’t intervene anymore and so the others. The last hour before I got home felt really bad for me, he would act like I was a stranger to him, while the others atleast tried to talk to me. When I left he told me he ain’t mad,just disappointed in me  and that he won’t try to help me again with that specific situation. Before I wanted to go to bed, I texted him to apologize and tried to explain to him why I couldnt text that girl, but his only response was: “ok ok”.  Today I texted him again and asked If i can do something to “redeem” myself and he said that he is alright, I just need to stop texting him.

Glasses that not only allow us to see, but allow us to see less. Earphones used in order to allow us to hear less.

My boyfriend and I were chilling in my room and he looked out the window, he was shocked and said “oh look, there’s an old man in her garden.” I got up to look, gave him a funny look on purpose and sat back down and carried on what I was doing. 

A few days later, we were leaving my house as he was entering hers and he said hello, I smiled at him (I was walking in front of my boyfriend so he wouldn’t have saw) and he said hello back, I turned to him and said “who are you talking too?” he said he was talking to the old man we saw in her garden a couple day prior and I said, “you’re really freaking me out, there wasn’t even an old man in her garden, I was wondering what you were on about.” Anyway long story short, I convinced him for about 2 months he was seeing a ghost until I got drunk and told him the truth, to my hilarity.

81,"Today I've woken up feeling sore and I'm thinking of things I could do to not feel like that. I think the cold makes pain feel worse. 

If you have an injury the best thing you can do is make the surrounding body bits better. I know this because I've tried all the massaging, stretching and painkillers variations out there and in the end nothing eased the pain like getting stronger. This is anecdotal but true.

Of course you have to go through other pain to get there so it's a double edged sword really. It's also hard to feel like I'm fitting in all the things I want to do and be active. 

Or is that a lie and I'm just lazy. 

People keep telling me to do swimming and pilates. Part of me thinks a spinal injury is a good opportunity to have an intervention with my body and the other part cringes at the thought. 

I haven't made many huge attempts to get moving again. I dabbled in Youtube's finest array of water aerobic tutorials specifically aimed at people with broken backs when I was on holiday but then a GIANT bug flew out of the water next to me causing me to run for my life with enough frenzy to probably undo all the water aerobic healing.

It literally broke the water barrier. It exploded out of the pool. It had serious weight to it, this bug. 

Last month I felt like this too, perpetually uncomfortable and stiff and at the end of my tether about it. You're not yourself when you're in pain. Of course as a twenty-something girl I booked a massage and figure this will solve my problems. I scoured Google long and hard for the Ultimate Local Pilates Guru.

That is the beauty of living in the city. I miss all the good places to walk my dog back home, and the pub (!) but in the city if you want something you can go and get it that day. Crazy.

I've never had a sports massage before but I think that's what happened. I know nothing will ever top it. I'll be chasing masseuses to hurt me like that for the rest of my life, seeking that first gateway massage.

It felt like my skeleton was being used as a kitchen utensil against my body. Like the action of scrubbing clothes on a clothes board or tenderising meat. In the end it was amazing and throughout I found myself gushing about how keen I was to commit to pilates (??) 

I tried pilates once before and it was similar to when I tried a ballet conditioning class and felt the muscly bits of my body crying - maybe this contributed to my injury... I think this about everything now. Was this where it all began?  Did planking do this to you? But I know it was really just me and my misguided desire to do front flips until they were perfect or I died. And I sure did die.
  
For Christmas I bought a productivity planner to guilt myself into admitting to my productivity planner that I've done fuck all exercise today. The fear led me to buy a fitness membership. 

Not for the full blown gym. Haha! The thought still makes me nervous and I'm unsure if I can go unsupervised/too skint to do the whole personal training thing. Only for swimming and it was still £15 a month (painful). 

I got carried away with my newfound productivity and tried to do both swimming and pilates in the one day. Before I continue with this diary any further it's important for me to say now that time does not seem to pass for me the same way it does for other people. It's a disease. I was born late. Literally, two weeks, and it hasn't stopped since. One day I'll be diagnosed as late. 

I heard RuPaul say he realised he was addicted to the stress of being late and that's how he broke the cycle. I picture myself when I'm late and it's the worst feeling ever. There is no way I am addicted to that feeling. 

And so I was late to pilates, trying to discreetly burst in with enough effort to prove my desire to be there but also not disrupt anybody's zen. The class itself was as bizarre as I'd hoped. 

We pulled bigger and more rubbery versions of those evil stretch band/physio souvenirs over our heads to stretch our backs. Mine kept pinging over my still-wet-from-swimming bun and I prayed to be delivered from the human energy field of Bridget Jones. 

I kept thinking of when people would blow up condoms and put them over their faces on the school bus. I described this to a friend who asked me 'you know when you put a condom over your face?' Well no.

Wish me luck I keep it up! The pilates not trying to put a condom over my face. Don't ever do that.   01/01/2019",29Apr2019,1

I play college soccer at a D1 university and I’m currently studying engineering. This semester was the start to my second year here and while at first it was hard adjusting, I grew to really love it here. 

For those of you who don’t know soccer, usually only 1 keeper plays. My team has 4. As a freshman I never played a minute. I didn’t really care though because school is all that really matters to me. I want to study pharmacy. 

On Friday, we had our end of the year meetings which is basically like a “let’s set goals for next year” kind of thing. I was optimistic and excited about the feedback I was gonna bear. To my dismay, that was not the way I felt after. I could tell by the environment that this wasn’t going to be a good conversation. In short, my coach basically told me that I’m always playing catch-up (in school and soccer) and that I’m significantly behind than the other ones and for that reason I’m not going to retain my scholarship next fall. 

My heart shattered. Immediately thinking back to where I went wrong. I came in unfit. There was times where I didn’t work as hard as I was supposed to. I fell behind in school. But overall, I’ve been a good contribution. Everyone has those struggles as an athlete. 

I’m so lost. I have no idea where I’m going from here. I love this school. I love it here and now it’s just all taken away. I can’t afford to go here and not play soccer. Soccer is what allowed me to attend. I feel like a failure. A disappointment.

89,"At my workplace, my family, acquaintances all of the Christian people there who keep talking about faith and god would rather have me respect them first for a while before they will show any respect to me JUST because I am younger than them all.

They are the meanest people I have ever met in my life and they seem to treat Atheists and Agnostics as well as other people with various religious beliefs as enemies and won't respect them at all and would rub their beliefs in their faces if they do something wrong.

I am 21 now About 8 years ago my parents sent me to multiple therapists to teach me a lesson that I am a bad child and that they will teach me how to behave in the real world and after the last one diagnosed me with Clinical Depression and Bipolar Disorder at age 17 and put me on meds. They kept bombarding me about how lazy and bad I am and I eventually dropped out of school. The therapist wanted to see my parents and inform them about my condition and what to do to help me. They pulled me from therapy, took me off my meds and told me that it's just a phase and it will pass. about a week after no meds I felt like I could just take a rope and end it all. They forced me to work at the family business and threatened to kick me out of the house if I refused and couldn't find any other job. I was so destroyed I just said yes and proceeded on with the family business. I am the youngest there and 90% of my family on my mother's side works there. They treat my like absolute garbage. They told me I have to do 3 jobs at once or I am gone: Manage one of the store rooms, Design piping drawings as well as making the manufacturing lists for the workshop to make the pipes. My mother works half a day and gets more than everyone who work their asses off each day. I once saw her pay slip and I then understood why they just buy a lot of stuff without complaining about money.. Unless it has to do with me or my sister.

Since I get paid my own salary and I am of age I figured they have absolutely no say in what I do outside their yard. I went to a Doctor and told her about past therapists and let her know about all of that stuff. The Doctor referred me to a Clinical Psychologist and immediately put me on meds due to the long time I have to wait for an appointment and I have to report to the Psychologist if I had progression with the meds or not. So nearing the appointment I have started to feel better and better each day up until today.. I have already forgot to take the meds the last 2 days due to me being so busy and running around like a crazy cat and I started feeling so crap that I started crying a lot last night in bed for no reason. Today I felt worse and just tried to go through it and took the meds as prescribed. I came home this afternoon and my mother starts going off on me being bad, they waste their money on me for nothing and that I need to ""drop the act and start acting like an adult"". I exploded.. I started to tell her how she breaks me down like this and that I have every right to defend myself against her even if she's my mother as well as telling her that's shes spoiled she gets free fuel from work and I have to pay my own, she gets paid a full day's wage every month and only works half a day whilst 50% of the time she just surfs on the internet viewing shopping websites and looking at pictures on Pinterest. She went off about how ungrateful I am and that pills won't heal me and only God can heal me ""If you started going to church sooner this wouldn't have happened"".

*""Why would a purely perfect god who can supposedly see the future.. Create a human and know they're going to suffer then eventually die and cause more pain and suffering to other humans, but instead says that the humans must believe in him or they will be tortured forever in a burning hell?  Doesn't it seem like we're already in hell?""* I asked..

Got scolded all over again and told to not talk back to her. I went to my room and sat for a while holding a knife to my stomach. I couldn't do it. I am starting to fall off of my Gym routine and the effects of the medication seem to be dissipating. I'm toppled by panic attacks.

I want to confess that I think it's the end for me and the treatment for my mental health. I am wasting my money on things that bring me joy like there's no care in life. My ex cheated on me and told me it's my fault for being a bad boyfriend and I am starting to believe her, I buy my friends a lot of gifts that would mean a lot to them since they deserve more than I do, I declined all the dates I could have had as I am scared I might hurt their feelings by being with them.

92,"I had one of those odd realisations that like to appear at inconvenient times, and I need to sound it out in some form so that it doesn't go. 

This one needs to stick, it needs to be married with action and thrown into the void because for me this was huge. 

Well done, little child, me. You dealt so much better with the abuse you were suffering than I *ever* gave you credit for. You handled things, as a very alone child, and teenager, so much better than I should have realised. I have been judging your actions through the eyes of me now. 

Me who knows what gaslighting is, and emotional abandonment, and what D.A.R.V.O is. Who knows that you were caught up in a cycle of abuse and trauma and didn't know how to find a way out because you knew too little, and were being trapped by everyone, at every exit. Me who realises now, that when you were confronted with a person who was everything you wanted to be, reacted poorly, with jealousy, because deep down - you knew that was who you were too. You are also just as talented, smart, and kind as those strangers around you. 

You were just never ever given the opportunity to be allowed to realise it and embrace it. 

You were completely alone for the vast majority of your life. You couldn't turn to your parents, most of your friends were false, and were never really those you could rely on. Teachers abandoned you also and made your situation worse many a time. 

There was not one person, your age, older, or qualified that you could have turned to, confided in, and trusted to help. Not one. 

I've scolded you so much for this, resented your perfectly understandable actions and behaviours, despised how you never came out the other end as well as you should have. 

And I am sorry, past me. 

Because you *did* come out the other end as well as you should have. You came out better. *So much* better. You're smart. You are kind, people come to *you* to sort out their problems, and you have real, wonderful friends. 

It isn't the quantity, it's the quality. 

So to those in my past that I have hurt somehow, I am very sorry. Sincerely. I was young, struggling, and with very little knowledge, but enough to know something was wrong with my life - but not yours. I might have lashed out, said something stupid, did something cruel but the more I realise it now, the more I know I was repeating learned behaviours from those who chose to abuse me. In those cases, I handled it my worst, and there aren't enough words in the world for me to truly express my sorrow at my behaviour towards you. 

But for a child, a child who was so very alone in the world, I could have handled those traumas far worse than I did. 

So well done past me, I'm proud of you. Thank you for all you did, because I think you kept me safe from even more pain, more despair than I thought you did. You found a way to break the cycle, and so many people don't get that chance and opportunity. You were exactly who you should have been in those moments. 

Thank you past me, and I'm sorry, but I promise present me will now try to move on. For future us' sake.",29Apr2019,12

He asked me if I wanted to see a movie with him and I said yes. He didn’t explicitly say it was a date, and I don’t even know if bats for my team (for all I know, we’re just friends seeing a movie), but either way I gotta see Endgame anyway, right? 

I’ve never gone on a date with a guy before. Maybe I’m just getting my hopes up, and I’m sure it’ll be fun either way, but a guy can wish, right?",29Apr2019,5

97,"so, i have told my roommate 3 times over the course of the semester to please clean her wads of long brown hair out of the shower drain when she is done. whenever i do, i come home and it’s gone, but the next day and the days following it clogs up again and never goes away. (btw i have short green hair so it’s definitely not mine.) i’ve shut my mouth and cleaned it myself too many times. not to mention, she also steals my cleaning stuff and even though i literally see it show up on her desk she says she’s never seen it and i have to buy new stuff since i just didn’t want to start a problem with someone who literally has access to all my shit when i’m not around.

since the semester is almost over, i just want to get some revenge. i was thinking something along the lines of saving up all the hair i clean from the shower drain and i hope to god i leave before her so i can dump it all in her stuff with a note that says something like “i kept finding this in the shower drain—thought you might be missing it” and block her number and leave.

103,"I'm a super anxious person, I can stress about everything in existence. Might have an anxiety disorder but I'm too lazy to get a diagnosis. 

And this godawful anxiety has affected me in every single part of my life. Fear of my loved ones leaving me or, worse, dying. Never being good enough. Never making it in life. Ruining everything for myself because of this constant fear. My health declining all the time because I am too stressed or tired to eat enough and well.

And, mainly, academic anxiety.
I'm in 12th grade now and tomorrow is my first A-level exam. German. I'm alright at it but thanks to other mental problems I didn't do anything yet. No studying, no planning, no nothing. Feels too surreal to think about, I'm absolutely not ready even though I've been preparing for these exams for years now.

But I'll be alright. It's not that hard to make it, I just have to pass math (since that's the only hard one) and I'll be done. I don't even need the best grades and there are exams coming I'll totally rock with little effort. So I shouldn't have to worry about this little dumb exam, but I still am? It's so weird.

Well, to get to the point: I'm so fucking hyped for the time after I finish school and have so much good stuff happening in my life right now. I'm in therapy and it's helping so much. I got together with the most wonderful man after being friends for years and I want nothing more than to spend all my following years with him. I have great opportunities waiting for me starting in September where I can try out one of my career dreams. And before that, months of a gorgeous summer and all the people I love to spend it with.

What I'm most excited about are the fresh summer evenings where we all sit together with none of the worries about school that have dominated my life and fucked up my mental health for 12 damned years. I love my life, I love my friends and family, I love my boyfriend so much and I finally learned to love myself as well. To think that just some years ago I was sure I wouldn't have managed living long enough to experience this many wonderful things...

Only this week to get through and if everything  goes well with the exams, I'll be free from this shit. 12 years and I'll finally be free. Might sound stupid, but school has been the worst years of my life due to extreme stress and bullying and I loathed every one of them. Don't think I'm alone with that experience, school systems all suck.

111,"I'll try to make this short, but it's a mess and I'm a little drunk and all over the place right now.


My father raped me when I was a child. I think I was about ten when it started and it ended when I moved out at 17. It didn't happen often, about 20 times or so. Only when he was really drunk. Started out as him just touching me as part of a “game” and ended up just being rape.


I've basically never told anyone.

I tried to tell my mom once after I moved out. I was high and sad and called her. Tried to tell her, but she dismissed it I guess. I didn't say anything directly, I just implied it.


Other than that, I've never spoken about it. I've been very ill, mentally, I suffer from depression and schizophrenia and have had a lot of psychologists and such but I've never been able to talk about it. It's like it's physically impossible, I can't get the words out of my mouth. 


I feel disgusting just writing about it. 


As far as I can remember I've had this attitude where I wouldn't let what he did to me define me as a person. I'm not what someone else did to me.

I never told anyone, but I fantasized about telling and him being jailed and punished I guess.


I don't really hate him honestly and I know that's fucked, I should. But it's just something I've put in a box in the back of my mind and tried to forget.


I didn't have any contact with him after I moved out, and I felt like I didn't even care about him.


My mom called on Tuesday and told me he died. He slit his wrists in the bathtub. 

I don't really know what to feel. Cheated? Because I never got revenge?


I feel like a failure. What if he did this to other people and I could have stopped him? On the other hand, I feel angry at myself for feeling like I HAD to do anything.


It's not my job. I didn't chose to make this happen to me. I dont want to be put in a box and have to be a fighter or something. I dont know if I even make sense.


I just mean, something happened to me which I won't let define me, so why do i have to like, stand up to all the ugliness in the world and fight a fight I dont really care about? It's not my choice to be a “voice” or something. 


I'm so selfish. I just want a fucking normal life!


I didn't want it to end like this, but I never wanted any of this.


I know he suffered from depression, and I guess that's why he did it. But I can't stop thinking about him doing it because of what he did to me.


But why would he suddenly do that? He never reached out to me or anything.


I know I ought to tell somebody, a professional, it just feels wrong.


You're supposed to confront these things I guess, but I honestly don't want to. I just want to get on with my life. I wish I could just cut that part of my memory out and forget everything. 


I don't want to be broken! I dont even know if I am broken. I'm a person. I dont know. It's just fucked. Had to tell someone, so it become you reddit. I feel like I sound crazy and hust rambling on so I think I'll just go to bed now.",29Apr2019,1
112,"We cut taxes for our job creators and the corporatIons they own so they could raise wages, toss out bonuses, lower costs to the consumer and create a plethora of great paying jobs. These new jobs would arise from the genius of the super rich to create new and fantastical things to brighten our existence. The only one who seems to have done this is Elon Musk. He's employed people to launch cars into space, create a new brand of tequila, a new surfboard, a tunneling project and of course the flamethrower. It's too bad all the people working on these things have to drive by disabled homeless veterans on their way in to work. That brings up an interesting point. Are the wealthy going to tackle homelessness or maybe fix Flints water system? How about a bit of cash for under funded inner city schools?

We both had a terrible childhood, which left us with PTSD, anxiety and insomnia.

But here I am, working my ass off. My PTSD haven’t been triggered in a long time. I’ve not experienced anxiety for three weeks. I don’t have any sleeping issues atm. I manage to wake up early, 4 times a week to exercise for 1,5 hour. Before I work as a substitute teacher. I can stand in front of a whole class without any anxiety now.

I’m the first of the children in the family to graduate (everyone has dropped out). I’m the first to get into all the universities I applied for. And now, I got a scholarship of 2500$. Which was merit based! And I’ve been the «dumb» twin my whole life.

119,"I'm back home because I just graduated college and am spending some time with my family before I head out of the country. Some backstory: I had a ""friend"" a few years ago who my parents met that turned out to be an emotionally abusive, manipulative asshole who actually made my life a living hell. I'm well aware now of the red flags that led to this relationship and my own reasons for falling in to this. Quite honestly, the whole experience has fucked me up and I'm in therapy for it. 

I had another friend stop by my house and my dad went on about how this friend I brought home was so much better than my other ""friend"". He always says things like ""I *knew* he was trouble, I knew something was off. How could you not tell?"" He does a ""character judgement check"" thing with everyone I know, too--my ex, best friends, etc.. Whether he thinks they're good, bad, or somewhere in-between, he won't hesitate to say it. When he ends up being right, he rubs it in my face by saying ""I told you! I knew they were bad!"" 

I love my dad, don't get me wrong. And I love my family. But today at dinner he brought up my old ""friend"" and further emphasized how much he knew that said ""friend"" was trouble. I went off (I don't ever go off, I'm not confrontational at all). It made me so angry. I have bullied myself for years for ignoring red flags and becoming such close friends with someone who is so obviously not a good person. I sometimes think I am the dumbest, most gullible person on the planet for ever trusting someone like him. I have constantly beat myself up for my terrible judgement of character. It's only just now that through therapy I'm working through my own negative self-talk. I KNOW I FUCKED UP. I know I misjudged this person and I feel guilty about it every. single. goddamn. day.   


And then my dad just brings up how he's always right about people, and that I should trust him always. He talks about it like he's so smart and I'm just dumb and naive for trusting people (and yeah, maybe I am), but I don't need constant reminders of how much I fucked up in choosing my friends *this one time*. Every. Single. Choice. or. Decision. I. Make. is what he KNEW I would do in the end: career-wise, he was right. My last relationship? He was right. My friendships? Always claims to be right. Like, I know I don't know a lot about life and I make mistakes but I really don't need or want them to be rubbed in. I do that to myself enough already, and it's not good.
