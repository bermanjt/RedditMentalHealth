1,"Hi. 

Like many, I’ve been a lurker for some time now and I thought it’s time to say hi, start putting myself out there and use this site to improve my life instead of wasting countless hours just scrolling, as interesting as everything is on here. 

I’ve noticed something about myself lately. I feel so much better when I write things down and can see how I feel rather than try to question myself in my head or talk it out with someone else like some other people do. I have to write to understand. So here I am writing. 

I feel like I’m a very rigid person who takes everything way too seriously. Everything but myself really. I’m trying to improve and learn to be more grateful and empathetic but it’s been hard. 

I also believe that I never really developed my full personality. Like there’s so much of myself that I haven’t explored because I’ve been too busy distracting myself from any and all pain and discomfort in my life in one way or another. I’ve been detached from my feelings for so long that it’s difficult for me to understand what I feel and why I feel it. 

That’s where writing comes in. So that’s what I’m going to do. Try to unravel this web of emotions and thoughts that have left me exhausted one post at a time. 

I’m sure people will eventually get sick of seeing my posts and tell me to take my emotional baggage to Twitter or something. Lol apologies in advance. ",14Feb2019,1

Might have a bit of birthday cake or something. But I've been wondering if I should just stay at home that day, as I feel it might just feel bitterly ironic. Is is pathetic to spend your 20th birthday like this? Am I better at home?",14Feb2019,1
4,"I never was really active on Reddit until very recently. I made this particular account specifically for super personal posting and whatnot (just anonymity, i know thats probably an irrelevant note because it looks like thats what a lot of people do anyway). Ive had another account for a long time that was for other uses (cosplay and art stuff, usually).

When i came across this subreddit and read everyone's posts seeking advice or comfort, it made me feel really fulfilled to talk to them or offer said advice and comfort. I also found that i relate heavily to most of what's posted and i feel like maybe some of you would feel a lot better if you had a neutral person who is willing to listen if you dont want to post openly about what youre going through.

Recently I have a lot more spare time and motivation, and helping people in ways i can has always been something ive loved to do (i wanted to be a therapist at one point but i think id be too empathetic?), so I'd like to say that if you're dealing with some shit and you feel like a burden or like you don't have anyone to talk to: please dont hesitate to reach out. I never offer advice without permission so i dont want ya to think im gonna hound you about stuff or provide input if that's not what youre looking for or what you need.

I know what it's like to have no one who understands...or even in general. Ive endured a lot of trauma and somehow managed to improve my life over time. If youre interested in details, you can find my ""condensed"" life story within my post history.

If you think that i might be a source of help or comfort for you, my inbox is open. I may be slow sometimes throughout the day (driving, sleeping, working) but i wont ghost you or leave you hanging without an explanation. No obligation, no pressure.

Also, i could use more people to talk to sometimes. I do really like making friends and talking to people about anything and everything but, due to my recent life stress, i havent really felt like going out or being present at our house parties.

So, yeah. Feel free. No pressure. Im usually always around.

7,"I am currently a sophomore. The teacher in question is in my Chemistry Honors class. 

For the first two marking periods we had an exellent teacher that taught everything up to comprehension. By the end of the second market period however, he left and had been replaced by a promising new teacher.

But, as we soon realized, she is absolutely not able to teach. The way she approaches a new subject is by instructing us to read the chapter in one night so she can just complain all class period about underperforming students and taking about her college life or other miscallaneous things instead of actually teaching us the subject. 

She constantly complains about being overworked and tired and how dealing with students just wears her out, which is understandable for her old age, but from what I see she does the bare minimum and she even finds the worksheets and class material she goes over online. If she is not able to handle the minimum efforts of teaching, then sadly I believe she is not in a position to teach.

The rare times she does go over topics, it feels like as if she is teaching us it as if she was reviewing an already mastered subject instead of introducing a skill to people totally incompetent. Another way to describe her teaching is she is very unorganized and fails to establish a foundation before she starts to go over the skill as a whole. 

She brings her, from my perspective, unfounded stress in the learning environment and makes students suffer from her spontaneous meltdowns. 

And a whole lot more. 

The constant phrase that is murmured around the classroom as she does a problem is ""when the heck were we taught this?"" I still do pretty well in the class because I already have experience in teaching myself things like Calculus and Programming, but many other students don't have that skill and shouldn't be forced to need to when we are supposed to have an adequate teacher. There is not one person that I talked to, and I purposely asked around from both her periods, who like her as an educator. 

Pretty much everyone I asked wants her gone, and once really bright students who excelled with the past teacher are now in a furious state that they don't know anything for at least 6 chapters. How can I approach this to the higher ups?

Tl;dr: New chemistry teacher is objectively bad. How can we stop her reign.

8,"So, let me preface this post with a few things: I do have a good job and understand it’s a much better situation than some. I don’t want to sound ungrateful, rather would appreciate advice going forward.

I really want to quit my job. And the good news is I’ve been able to interview around and start the process! But now it’s a lot of in between time and I would love to understand what I’m supposed to do with it. 

There have been weeks I have woken up and actually dreaded going to work. My coworkers are... fine. They’re there to do a job, nothing more, nothing less. I wouldn’t say they’re not nice but we would never really be friends. My projects have been stalled and halted countless times, to a point where a lot of the people involved have become very indifferent to them. The overall company is either moving out of the area or quitting. And honestly, I don’t love my work. All my friends would describe me as a passionate, caring, person, and for me to work at things that beat me down I don’t really laugh is saying something. 

So I’ve empowered myself and I’m working on changing it. But until a new job works out, what advice do you have to help me keep going? I want to keep positive outlooks on things and it doesn’t always happen. And until I have a new job (which could be a while given how everything works out), I can’t quit or really let my team now. Any tips on that? 

My motivation for applying and working that angle is there. I’m retracting myself, talking interview practice, and rewrote my entire resume. It’s just the in between time. All I want to do sometimes is just walk and say, “Well, that’s not my problem. I quit.” I won’t, because that’s bad form and burning bridges is not my goal. Rather, ways to get through a transition time correctly. Thanks!

Tl;dr: I want to quit my job, but I’m still working out getting a new one. What are some ways to motivate myself during this time period? ",14Feb2019,1

17,"(Skip to the last paragraph for what is basically a TL;DR, but ideally read the full thing)

So basically I’m a 20 year old virgin (I’m gonna be 21 in a couple of months), and while for a long time the only thing really pushing me to want to do it was peer pressure and wanting it over with, to put it bluntly lately I’ve been mega horny. I honestly think its partly a delayed puberty thing going on, like in the last year or so I’ve changed noticeably, I still don’t have much armpit hair yet but more is growing in now, more hair on my stomach and shit, etc. I think my face looks a lot more masculine now too, I’ve always been a short, baby-faced guy, but lately I think I’m noticeably better looking and I actually get some degree of attention off girls now.

Anyway, going off topic here. For the past couple of years I’ve had a massive thing for my best friend. I’d actually say she’s the first girl I’ve ‘fallen in love with’, I think I’m always gonna have a soft spot for her. We’re probably always gonna be in each other’s lives. She had a boyfriend the full time, and I told her how I feel, and nothing happened but awkwardness and cutting contact for a few months, so after a healthy dose of complete heartbreak I decided I need to move on. Since then little crushes have came and went, but I feel like I’m always comparing them to her in the back of my head.

Part of trying to move the fuck on has been me downloading Tinder. I first got it like a year ago, and had like no success at all lmfao. But like I said, I’ve changed a bit in the past year. So recently I gave it another go, and I was shocked by how well I’ve been doing. While I’ve only really ‘hit it off’ with a few people, I’ve matched with maybe 50 in a month if I include people that have been unmatched and shit. It’s been a nice little confidence boost.

The last week has kinda felt like a crossroads for me. On the best friend front, she broke up with her boyfriend about a week ago. She’s been completely heartbroken, and she says I’ve kinda been her rock through it all. I feel completely awful seeing her like this, it’s fucking horrible, but having said that obviously I’ve thought to myself about what the future might hold for us. I always thought it was pretty obvious there was something between us, and that if the timing had matched up better something might have happened. By the time I realised how crazy I was about her she was deep in her relationship. In between the bouts of crying and asking me why she’s not good enough, she’s been pretty obviously flirting with me. I’m trying not to read into it; she’s in an emotionally vulnerable place, her mind’s probably all over the fucking place. But she’s outright joked about us going on dates, at one point said it was ‘a shame’ she couldn’t send me nudes of her gym progress, and overall the vibe between us has just been far more intense and sexual than it would ever have been if she was still with him. She knows exactly how I’ve felt about her, so I don’t think she’s gonna flirt with me just for the sake of it, but again, she’s not in the best place. Even if she asked me to sleep with her tomorrow, I’d probably not do it. If anything ever happened between us I don’t want it to be some stupid rebound; I’d want it to be something we both go into clear-headed, and completely sure of what we want. It would probably take a good few months before that’s possible.

On the Tinder front, I matched with a girl a couple of days ago who is extremely open to us hooking up, and that I definitely wouldn’t mind hooking up with. Like she’s outright told me that she wants to fuck me, but that we should still just talk for a few days and get to know each other. From our convos I’ve kinda learned she’s honestly probably a bit much for a virgin like me to handle sexually hahahaa. She’s into some pretty kinky stuff, which I have nothing against, but for a first timer I feel like it would be intimidating as fuck. But again, the hormones are kinda raging, and honestly I just want to get it done. But I don’t know how I’d feel losing my virginity in a hook up like that. Like I don’t want to let the opportunity just pass by, since the chance really hasn’t came around like at all, but at the same time I just don’t know if it’s right for me. Having said that, I feel like getting it out of the way with a casual hookup means that when the people that really matter come along later, I’ll have a better time and know what to do.

So, to sum it up quickly, I can either hook up with this girl from Tinder and get it over with, or see how things progress with my best friend, even though her recent flirting with me could be for literally any reason cause of how emotional she is over a recent break up, and I’d potentially write off a solid change for myself just waiting for ‘the perfect time’. Having said that, the girl from Tinder is probably a bit too much for me, and it could be a terrible first time that I’d massively regret. I really don’t know what to do here, so any advice would be massively appreciated.",14Feb2019,1

21,"I wanted to share an embarrassing (and funny) experience I had many years ago.  Back when I was at uni I used to catch a train from the city to the local station near my home.  This trip would typically take around an hour, stopping at roughly 15 stations along the way.  If I was lucky, I occasionally caught a rare express train that would stop at one station, then my station - this was a 25 minute ride.

&amp;#x200B;

On one particular day, I fell asleep immediately after boarding the express train, then awoke just as the train was pulling in to my local station - I thought it was quite fortunate because the following stop was another half hour away, which meant if I missed my stop, it would waste at least an hour of my time to get back home.

&amp;#x200B;

As I went to rise from my seat, I had a problem.  The same way your arm or foot might experience numbness while sleeping, I noticed that both my legs had fallen asleep, and I was completely numb from the waist down.  I was horrified that my legs were devoid of all feeling!  I tried to restore life to my legs by banging them with my fists but that didn't work.  At this point, people were getting off the train and I knew I only had a matter of seconds to get off, or face another tedious hour of travel.  To make matters worse I was at the top level of the carriage and still had to make it down the stairs to get to the exit of the train.  I started to panic.

&amp;#x200B;

Left with no other options and determined to get off the train, I proceeded to crawl along the floor of the train with my arms, with my bag in one hand and my lifeless body dragging behind me.  I dove down the stairs head first and clambered towards the exit, just making it out the doors as they were closing.  As embarrassing as this was, I felt a huge sense of relief that I made it off the train.

&amp;#x200B;

Then just as I leapt onto the platform, all feeling miraculously returned to my legs, and I rose to my feet and casually walked off.  As I looked back, I noticed many shocked and confused expressions on the faces of the passengers on the packed train who watched my unorthodox departure.

&amp;#x200B;

To this day, I occasionally laugh to myself about this experience, and what thoughts would possibly have gone through the minds of those who witnessed this oddity.  I don't know if this has happened to anyone else but it was the first and only time it has happened to me.  Assuming this level of paresthesia is rare, I'm sure some would still be unsure of what they saw that day.",14Feb2019,1

It snowed, badly for our area (the news seriously calls it a snowpocalypse), and we're new to this weather. After a weekend of snow, he was worried about driving and decided he was going to call out. Then he spent hours watching the snow coverage on the news, basically repeat stories of every bad thing they could find across the region.

I noticed he was really having an anxiety attack or something, he was fixated, tunnel vision, and had started to shut down.

In the past, I would have tried to reassure him, joke, or prod him out of it, and then he'd say something rude, we'd spiral into an all out argument.

I'm getting better about how to deal with him effectively. I sat next to him during a commercial (his gaze hadn't moved from the tv), scootched over a bit, hit mute on the tv remote. 

Hey. I touched him on the arm, Be HERE. 

I am, he said, knee-jerk reflex.

Hey hey, I said, touching his arm again. It's okay. Be HERE. We're fine. You got the day off. No driving your (crappy front wheel drive) work vehicle. We have AWD, if we need to go anywhere.

He snapped out of it a little, nervously chuckled.

Okay, I said. Nothing to do but wait it out. Get out the snow shovel when the snow stops, work off some energy. It's a new experience for us. Enjoy it. Or watch a movie or something, take your mind off this. 

We talked a little, he was able to relax, get out of his shutdown state. I felt good about helping him, but also bad that it's taken me so long to figure out how to help him. He's a good man and I love him.

35,"This was unbelievably complex, I’m astonished that my mind generated these thoughts. This dream was extremely detailed so i will miss some parts.

I’m in a mansion at a mansion party with my friends jimmy and Brandon. They were one of our customers at work. Thing is, they were out of town and had their housekeepers who was in her 40s with a British accent watching the place. She was pretty cute, never seen her before.

Me and one of my friend ended up in a secluded room with the house keepers. She was telling us how she has a dick, balls, and a vagina. We were like wtf. She started to get turned on and seduced my friend, and started giving him a blowjob. I passed when she offered to blow me, but i eventually caved and started receiving a blowjob but I couldn’t get hard. She told me her jaw hurts and that i can’t seem to get it up. I said I’m sorry, and we both said oh well.

I went to my guest room and went to sleep. Woke up, and it’s just me in the house. My new cat is there as well. I walk out of my room and see that 90% of the house is made of pool cage screening and that my cat has torn it up overnight. I can’t find my cat.

I get a text from my friend saying that the owners of the house have murdered 20-30 people. A sense of extreme doom fell upon me. 

I wake up again and I’m in some twisted dark room, and i try to use my phone and it says we are going to play a game. Play correctly and you leave. 

Spot the troll face when you hear laughing. I hear laughing, a troll face appears inside of a dark closet across the room. I said there it is! Nothing happens and everything goes dark. I try to leave the room but the door is locked. I tried to run for a window and jump out of it to kill myself, but i just respawned back in the room.

I remember grabbing my phone to call the police but when i would try to call, I would get some twisted voicemail saying I’m not permitted to do that and to finish the game.

The bedroom door opened and i ran out. I tried jumping out of like 10 different windows to kill myself and I respawned every time. I remember seeing a very fat man in the living room watching TV but he seemed unaware of my presence and uninterested in my escapades. I am positive he is the owner of the house.

Then, my phone gets an apple notification saying “Your phone will revert to apple settings now. Would you like to proceed?” I click yes. I realize that they installed software on my phone to stop me from making outbound calls, and since i was on the latest iOS version, apple may have known about the security vulnerability and implemented a feature to stop that hack from running on my phone.

I then call the real police. Then it cuts to a police station and I’m talking to a female cop. I’m telling her they’re killers, but I’m panicking and can barely talk. Some people walk in acting like they’re just average joes but I’m suspicious that they’re involved and that I’m still in the mansion owners’ makeshift terror reality. The officer tells me to hide behind the counter and that she will he right back with some food for me.

She walks away, and the average joes leaned over the counter and said “they will be locked up, don’t worry.”

I said “how do you know who I’m panicking about?” They had no response. They knew what was going on. The officer returns with a plate of meat. She’s in a happy mood as I’m feasting on the meat. It looked like spam, but I was really hungry apparently.

She then says “Nothing better than watching them eat themselves.” Apparently i was eating my own meat.

36,"Sorry for my English, it's not my first language, so maybe I have several errors. 

I have never had a group of friends or person or family member which I could interact more than a couple of minutes after they or I stopped of talking about  something, an awkward silence starts like, now what?

Today I was on college and I find a ""friend"" (or acquaintance), we chat a couple of minutes and then a friend of him show up and they start to talk between each other, and I was just standing there just listening when someonebehindme asked me a question, I turned and my ""friend"" was gone, so I'm just standing there alone.

And I have a couple of others ""friends"" who don't know each other, which sometimes they say: ""let's go to this place where the others guys are"" and I say ""okay let's go"", and when we arrive to where the other guys are they start talking between each other about stuff I don't like, or stuff I don't know because I'm not in that class, or they start talking about story's that happened to them, and after that they say: ""we will tell you later""or ""you wouldn't understand because you weren't there"", so I just stay a couple of minutes standing there and then I just say I have to go, or  I just spend time on my phone.

So practically I'm the backup friend when all the other friends are busy, one even tell me ""I was bored and all the others guys where on class or busy so I that's why I called you.""

Ive researched a lot of ways to die (minimum height to cause likely death, drop hang vs regular hang, overdose, etc.) You get the idea.

40,"Incidentally, it was what I would write to myself 8 years previously:

&gt;I would tell him that mistakes don't go away.

&gt;It seems like our society almost encourages us to screw up. As a teenager, I was expected to make mistakes, punished, but told not to feel very bad about it. ""Don't worry, everyone makes mistakes"". They tell you that it isn't the end of everything if you screw up, as long as you learned a lesson.

&gt;Bullshit. Screw around for a semester? There goes my childhood dream; my GPA is too low to become an astronaut. Have a few one night stands one ""carefree"" summer? Now everyone you know thinks you are a slut/player. You don't remember your first 2 years of college very well? Now all of your family thinks that you are an alcoholic. Screw up and get a minor charge on your record? Well good luck getting that job you wanted with the FBI, they won't even look at you.

&gt;If I could tell my younger self anything, I would tell him to treat making mistakes like herpes; you just don't get rid of that shit. Yes, your reputation isn't permanent, but unless you want to find an entirely new social group, you are stuck with everything you did when you knew you could get away with it.

&gt;The outlook is worse from there. Every time you accidentally miss a $14 credit card payment or two, you set yourself back in a horrible way. Maybe you picked the wrong major, and are now stuck with a mound of debt, and a shit job to pay it off. Long story short, don't screw around and be dumb because everyone else at your age is and every one is expecting you to. Cause you are probably going to lose the opportunity to follow your childhood dreams.

Funny how time changes things. 8 years ago I was probably mad at myself for goofing off too much. I had a mediocre GPA in a low demand major (psychology) and must have felt like I closed a lot of doors for myself. After I wrote this I fixed my GPA, got into grad school, and got a nice job. All of the people I was so concerned about having a good reputation with faded away after college ended. I thought I'd be content after all of these things were worked out, but all I found when I got there were more problems that needed to be fixed before I could be happy. 

It's hard to explain exactly what changed in a succinct manner, but at some point I realized that all of the things I was chasing in the pursuit of happiness were being spoon fed to me by society. After this I took a step back, started re-evaluating every goal and motivation I had, and started building a more intrinsic basis for happiness. The ironic thing is that giving up the things I thought would make me happy has made me far happier than I've been in a very long time. ",14Feb2019,1
41,"So I'm a 27f living on the other side of the world (France) with my partner (who is from this country originally). I've overcome a lot with visas and the language barriers until finally I have gotten myself into stability. I am renting an apartment in a little village south of Paris with my partner and working full time in Paris. My original job in my home country was an early childhood teacher as I have studied three years to be there. Here the qualification doesn't work the same and so I earn half the amount of money and in the lowest position in my field -_-  

I have been working there for a year so far but it's taking its toll on me. I feel completely under appreciated, I get paid minimum wage and have to travel 1.5 - 2 hours each way every day. There are some people there with half the qualifications and experience, who tell me what to do and criticize me. It's so difficult backing your actions in a language which you barely know how to speak, I think I would have definitely been able to stay my ground if everyone spoke English. After work and travel time I have no time for myself. I get home at 7 pm eat, shower, prepare for the next day then in bed at 9.30pm to wake up at 6 am and start over. It's draining my soul out of me, really. 

I thought I could hang in there until I learn enough french to get a better job with nicer hours closer to my home, but I don't know if I can any more.

My partner is studying full time and has no time for a job as part of his studies he needs to work full time for weeks on end (for free). That means I'm paying all the rent and most of the groceries, he had some savings which are decreasing which he pays the electricity, phones, sometimes other things and gas. 

Also finding another job is very difficult, I've been in the process for a long time, there's only so many jobs for English speakers who work with young children.

Am I being over dramatic and this is pretty normal for people? Should I risk taking one day off a week as a mental break and work on my french?  Doing that I would just make enough money to get by, or are there any other suggestions/advice? ",14Feb2019,1

46,"Ironically today of all days when the people who are alone are made to feel even more alone by a bullshit marketed “holiday” shit from the past comes up to throw myself back into a bad mood after making progress for years to try and move on from the past.  I could really write a story, book, movie, or whatever of a fucked up life I’ve lived.  It definitely wasn’t the worst, but sure as hell wasnt ideal, but the fucked up thing is if it was so bad why didn’t I put more effort into doing what I always wanted to do since high school which was move away and start a new life?  Instead I fucked around and didn’t concentrate on school enough, worked at jobs I hated, did the wrong things, hung out with the wrong people, and got involved with the wrong girls.  After getting out of bad relationship, and pushing the bullshit people and “friends” away I’m barely on the right path to get my life together, but I took a deal to stay stuck here for a few more years and finish school finally.  It’s hard though when something as simple as seeing a few pictures and bullshit comments, brings back bad feelings and anger, and when all I want is to get the fuck out of here, distance myself, and start a new life I can’t and I have to keep trying to concentrate on school.  I know a lot of you feel lonely too out there and have had issues in life but fuck I wish I could play a movie of my life out for people to see what people think and maybe agree and say “yea, that’s fucked I’m sorry you dealt with all that shit.”  I know I made some bad decisions, and should have known better in some situations, but I can’t help but feel I circumstantially happened to have some of the worst kinds of people and situations in my life even from the fuckin getgo.  It’s amazing to myself that I’ve been able to deal with it all and be at the point I’m st now without having seen a therapist or put on meds or gone fucking crazy and offed myself.  I feel for anyone who has said fuck it and quit on life, or needs meds, or regular counseling.  Life can just really be fucked.  Venting over

Just here on Reddit though.

14/02/2019 Now

For a bit of context about me, I'm 25 year old male.

Okay, so...currently my life consists of doing martial arts (Judo and Muay Thai) and resistance training with personal trainers twice a week. For the past 3 weeks, I've also been learning Japanese via Pimsleur Language Programs. I've also tried to implement a daily habit of reading a physical book, but that's kinda gone to crap. I'm still reading, but it's just inconsistent. And the past 10 days I've been meditating via the Headspace app. It's awesome, wish I didn't have to pay so much to access all the other courses though. I've been taking a cold shower basically everyday since mid-December, but this week I stopped with that habit as I recently began to think warm showers might be beneficial for muscular endurance. I was listening to Dr. Rhonda Patrick talk about health benefits of sauna on Youtube.

I'm also job hunting atm, working on my resumes; and in the process, learning how to recognise and sell my skills and accomplishments. This has traditionally been quite tough as I grew up with low self-esteem, was constantly self-critical, and had social anxiety, partly stemming from feeling inferior. However, though I did experience some stalls/bumps in doing my resume where my insecurities arose, I've pushed through and just kept working on it everyday. And now, it's gotten pretty good so I'm happy.

I also began working on [Self-Authoring](https://www.selfauthoring.com) again. I bought this like 2 years ago, and made little progress on it. Now that I have time, and since I've been making steady progress on my self-development over the past 6-7 months; I thought it would be pretty good for myself to put in the work and complete this. For those wondering, I bought the whole Self-Authoring suite, which means I get access to all four modules/courses (present authoring faults, present authoring virtues, future authoring and past authoring). There were suggestions to do sequentially as Faults, Future, Virtues and Past Authoring, so I'm planning on doing it that way. I've been working on Faults, and was planning on setting aside time everyday to do Self-Authoring, but unfortunately I haven't done that. So that's something I need to work on.

3 weeks ago I also began time scheduling once again. Time management was something I began to do and take very seriously in my final year of High School (which was 7 years ago now!). Because there was so much study to do, and because I planned my days diligently, I was always hyper aware of where my time and attention was going to back then. However, after High School, this habit...began to disappear, ever so slowly. Along with my good study habits. Anyways! Over the intervening years, I've kinda played around with time scheduling, but never stuck to it diligently for extended periods of time. I mean, nobody ever sticks to time schedules perfectly, but I just quit using them within the span of a week or so. Or sporadically time scheduled. There were many times I thought maybe this strategy just doesn't work for me, and I gotta try to work on myself and find other ways to be productive. But...the appeal of it never disappeared from my mind.

So in late January I began to be inspired to time schedule again after seeing [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHekURJBR0o) pop up in my Youtube feed. And this time, I aimed to stick with it for a period of 3 weeks as a goal. Just to see where it takes me, and how different my life is when I schedule it versus when I don't schedule it. (Keep in mind, I have not been working for the past month and a half since finishing my contract work end of last year.)

This time, I downloaded and printed off a weekly timetable sheet, where the day was segmented by hours, and those hours were represented by blank boxes, which you fill up with planned activities/events (basically like Google Calendar). Previously, I used to just write in a notebook '8am-9am: do xx, 12pm-2pm: do yy'. I think having a visual representation of your weekly schedule works much better; as it is alot more concrete than my previous method.

Anyways, over the past 3 weeks, I have been gradually filling up my days with more tasks. I decided I wouldn't get super overexcited and hyped about this goal of mine because that's too easy and often results in not giving a shit about the goal after like 2-4 weeks lol. First week was pretty chill, I didn't add many tasks and made physical exercise and martial arts classes my main priority. However, 2nd week I started my job hunting process, and began working on the Self-Authoring process. 3rd week I added in even more 'work' hours than the previous week. An unfortunate trend I've been observing though, is that the number of martial arts classes/physical exercise sessions I do has been decreasing by a session over each week. I think that has to do with the level of novelty over it declining, as well as spending more of my time working. Which I guess tires you out a little. My mood has also been steadily declining over the weeks too. Like, this week my motivation for life in general has noticeably decreased compared to previous 2 weeks. Maybe I need to deliberately schedule in some better recovery and 'Me' time. It could also be due to a decreasing social life / feelings of disconnect with my friends.

Anyways, even though I haven't stuck to the schedule that great as the weeks went by, I can still say my life is more productive with it. Now I need to work on setting up short-term weekly goals or themes/priorities; so I can relate my time schedule back to my overall vision when I'm not feeling motivated.

**END NOW**

So wow, I ended up writing waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more than expected. It just flowed out, as it still is now lol. 

Anyways, my aim for the next month will be to increase my martial arts class attendance even more. I've probably averaged 4 sessions a week over the past 3 weeks. I'd like to get that up to 7x a week (if I'm still not working anyways). I'd like to be working within the next month of course. And I definitely need to sort out my habits of Self-Authoring and reading everyday.

61,"I’m turning 19 in 2 months and i feel like I’m wasting my time even though i have a pretty good idea of what I want and what I’m currently getting into.

My dad is well in favor of school and getting a degree because almost no one has a degree in my family. A good few of them don’t even have a high school diploma!! Luckily I graduated high school although i should admit that I didn’t really care much about school and barely graduated. 

However, the problem starts here. 
I dont want to go to college. 
And this makes my dad especially get riled up and i totally understand why. My family truly believes that a degree is the only route to success. And it definitely helps but I’ve realized that it isn’t the only way and it is of no use for me at the moment. 

Let me explain why i dont want to go.
I have 0 interest in anything that REQUIRES a college education. It’s also really really expensive for a very low probability of me being able to pay back student loans with the degree in my field of interest. Even if i tried to cash flow it, it wouldn’t be worth it. I’m into photography and graphic design and I’ve learned everything on my own when it came to photo manipulation and what makes good design. I’ve done plenty of work for small and big companies since i was 14 years old. I’m relatively new to photography although I’d like to believe that I’m picking that up really really fast. And i know its because i am genuinely interested and i even found a way to monetize it even if its a little bit.

Luckily, my brother and I are currently working with a billionaire in NYC as visual directors for a new fitness brand and gym he is starting. Even after this great opportunity we’ve got, my dad still feels like we’re failing him because we dont have a college education. He never said it to us but he has that energy around him and he complains about is not going to college all the time. And he always compares us to other people and family members who have degrees. My mom supports us and understands what I’m talking about but i know deep down she wishes we went to college. 

Crazy thing is, the ones who are doing the best in my entire family had either never went to college or just didn’t finish it. My moms uncle is a multi millionaire and he didnt even finish middle school and my moms cousin is also a millionaire with no college degree. The others who are doing well with their degrees also make good money but it isnt anywhere near millions. And to top that off they arent even happy!!!

So to wrap it all up, i feel this immense pressure on me to become successful because i know my family feels like I’m getting nowhere and that im wasting away my precious years. 

What do you guys think? Should i go to school for another reason? Some people say its good to have a plan b degree. But idk in what field to begin with.

Years ago when I was in college I had been dating ""the one"" (I thought), but he was in HS and I was a freshman in college and things had been admittedly rough. I got close to a guy I was in theatre with, although there was nothing going on between us. One night we went to grab some dinner and we came back and watched some dumb youtube videos in my dorm, and he maybe said something funny and left. I felt so happy, but then when I knew he left the dorm, I started crying. I was baffled. Why would I cry if I was so happy?

Now, looking back, I believe it was because I was so unhappy in the relationship I was in. I wanted to be with my boyfriend at the time, but I had so much fun with someone else that it really worried me and kind of scared me. My bf of the time later broke up with me (nothing happened between me and the other dude while the bf and I were together) and I DID date the other dude in a fit of depressed rebounding. Felt like I should add that in there.

Fast forward to now, 7 years later. I've been dating my current boyfriend for five years. I moved to another country this past summer and we've been doing LD. I don't really have any complaints. We've been pretty okay.

BUT today some people from a church I started going to here, came to my door. I've had them visited unexpectedly before, but today G came to my door as well. I've spoken to G two or three times at church, but he's always been very kind, charming, and handsome. He says ""sit with me"" so I don't feel alone and chats me up while I'm at church. I don't know if it's more than him being nice or if there's more to it, but I had always brushed it off, because I'm in a relationship and I don't care. Today was different though. They came to my door, he made this funny comment about bringing chocolate I could've bought myself at the convenience store and then talked and talked. The other guy wanted to leave, I could tell, but G just kept going.

When they left I was smiling and feeling so good, but as I closed the door, the same thing I felt 7 years ago came back. I had to fight back these tears that came out of seemingly nowhere. I still feel a bit sad and weird at this moment.

Anyway to sum it up, I don't know if this is a sign that my current relationship is in need of some TLC or if this is just some weird fluke with me?

Does anyone ever get this way? What do you do to combat it? Any deep insights? Thoughts?

TLDR; I'm dating someone and another dude from church came to my house as a visitation with some other people. The ordeal made me so happy. But I got super sad after the fact, and I'm not exactly sure why. ",14Feb2019,1
67,"This is my first post on this sub, I hope this is the right place for it. Also, sorry ahead of time for any spelling or grammar errors.

So, as I said in the title, I have no idea when people are flirting with me, something I didn't even realize until a couple of years ago, at the age of 26.  Until then, I just thought that no one ever hit on me, probably because I'm just not that attractive. This really messed with my already low self-esteem. 

Anyway, a couple of years ago, my then partner, now ex (don't ask how we got together, or how I even realized she was into me), went out to a club with a friend. My partner and friend each went to say hi to people, and I found a couch off to the side to sit on since I'm not into dancing. A few minutes later, a guy comes up to me, drink in hand, and asked if the spot next to me was taken. I said it wasn't, and he sat down. We talked a little. He asked me about the club we were in, and I told him about it and about how I liked it better than another nearby club that catered to a similar crowd. It seemed to me like a normal conversation, we got to know each other a little, and he seemed nice.

 While we were talking, my partner came over to see how I was, and I introduced her to my new friend. He quickly said goodbye and left. I didn't think much of it at the time. We proceeded to have fun for the rest of the night, not getting home until early morning.

The next day, my partner asked me about the guy I was talking to the night before, and I told her how we were just talking and that he seemed interesting. All of a sudden my partner said ""wait, so this whole time you didn't realize he was trying to hit on you all night?""

I told her that I hadn't realized, and all of a sudden it dawned on me that maybe people are hitting on me, and I don't even know it. It was a pretty big ego boost, but also made me wonder why it was that I hadn't noticed.

About a year later, at the age of 27, I was diagnosed with autism, which makes a lot of sense in hindsight. I function mostly normally. I have a steady job, an apartment, a boyfriend, and a cat, and I'm mostly able to stay on top of things. That's probably why it took so long to diagnose, even though I knew I was a little different from most people my entire life, I just couldn't pinpoint what it was.

Well, that was the long-winded story about how I figured out that I might actually be attractive and that people do flirt with me.

Hope you enjoyed it, and that it wasn't too long.

72,"I’m very unhappy with my current work/life situation. I’m a young adult and living with my husband  (the only thing I’m truly happy about right now). I recently moved to a new state with him  because he was transferred for his job. We weren’t thrilled about the transfer but he was making more than me so we decided to follow the money. I found a job shortly before we moved to this new state and was trying to be optimistic about the move. We were leaving a beautiful state and family behind so it was a hard move to begin with. But, things still haven’t gotten better. 

We live in a very shitty apartment in not-the-best neighborhood. I have over an hour commute to work and after doing some math, I spend about 11-12 hours a day working/commuting and a total of 5 hours awake (morning and evening combined) at home. Factor in an hour to get ready for work and an hour to make dinner at home and I have maybe 3 hours to myself which usually gets taken over by other chores or just trying to get some alone time with my husband. 

Because of how expensive homes AND apartments are, we can’t afford to move closer to my job or to a better area. Because of the industry I work in and area we live, there are no jobs related to my experience near my current apartment. My husband can’t leave his job and find a new one because of his current work contract. Basically says if he quits in the next two years he owes the company $10,000. 

Basically, I am miserable at home (awful landlord, crazy neighbors), on my commute to and from work (aggressive drivers, on the road for long periods of time), and at work (stressful work, lots of overtime). It’s gotten to the point that I come home crying every day and can’t calm down long enough to enjoy the few hours at home with my husband. 

Does anyone have any advice on what I should do next to get out of this awful situation? Or does anyone at least have any words of encouragement while we wait out this work contract? I’m desperate to leave this entire state and our jobs behind. ",14Feb2019,1

75,"A lot of the time I feel like I don’t belong here. Actually I’ve felt like this my entire life. It’s like I can never really get along with people or fit in with any group, no matter how hard I try. I can barely maintain any personal relationships because I’m not good at talking. I either have nothing to say, or have too many things in my mind to say, but struggle to put them all into a cohesive sentence. I’m too serious for people most people who just want light hearted fun, cause I don’t know how to make jokes. The only way I know how to talk is by giving advice to people. 

I also think really differently from everyone else. I read situations differently from how people would normally read it, so I miss a lot of details that most people catch on. I’m not very good with common sense. But at the same time, I notice a lot of details that most people don’t normally bother to notice, which allows me to stand out from other people. I struggled to become appreciated in jobs because I can’t follow rules very well. I can only do well when I follow my own rules. 

I’ve been told that by a lot of people that I’m not normal. Physically, I’ve been lucky enough to be blessed with really good looks, so you if you first saw me, you wouldn’t expect someone like me to have this much internal conflict. But that’s how I’m treated by everyone that knows me. Like I’m some kind of social cripple. Because I can’t think like everyone else does. And I don’t know how to deal with it, because it gets in the way of me achieving what I want to in life, and forming long term relationships with other people.

77,"I’m a university student and recently things have become really tough. There are several problems that I’ve got no idea how to solve:

1. Social anxiety: it’s insanely stressful for me to interact with people. My classmates are girls and I’m the only guy in the group so it makes interactions even harder cause I try to be nice with them. Sometimes I get random panic attacks (dizziness, increased heartbeat, sweaty and trembling palms) that make it impossible to talk to anyone or even to keep up with what the teacher is saying during lectures. Moreover, I cannot even approach my crush, cause this girl is very cute and adorable
2. Irritated bowel syndrome: this thing makes my life like ten times harder. I have to endure extreme pain all the time and I also often get late for classes. Recently one of my teachers (he’s not aware of this problem) has told me that he won’t let me in for the class if I get even a minute late ever again. IBS + panic attacks also make things like public speaking extremely difficult
3. Conscription: the main reason I study at university is to avoid it. For me conscription is constant beating, humiliation, shitty food, life without sleep and weekends and being in a tough environment 24/7. My health is not good enough to endure conscription, I just won’t stand it. Also if I’m gonna have a girlfriend, she is not gonna wait for me to return. Most girls here break up with their boyfriends if those get conscripted.

There are several other problems like studying in the faculty that I don’t like but cannot change faculty because here it’s almost impossible. Psychological help is also very expensive and mostly useless here so for me it’s not an option.

97," 

I joined a new workplace.I was focusing  hard to get going.

Once,i  noticed a female looking at me ,she was really cute. I took it as an  accident and proceeded to mind my business.For next few days, i caught  her looking at me during different instances.I took it easy and did  nothing about it(which was hard).  Couple of weeks later, i was passing  by the exit and she was there alone and our eyes met again.I gave her a  nice smile this time and she reciprocated.I remember the date as well.  Now, for next few days , i noticed her following me to the coffee  machine 8/10 times..we used to look at each other and smile . I wondered  if its a coincidence of timings but no it happened irrespective of  schedule.This routine was so understandable that she she sometimes would  make an eye contact while going for coffee and i would follow her  
After  being this sure of the situation and also of myself (because i rarely  like someone so much), i thought i would take the initiative to talk  next time we met and i did. We spoke but she seemed shy when others were  around us.

To make things easier, i  decided to talk to her on social net.platform(which i rarey use for this  purpose) and sent her  requests to add me. I only wanted to know her as  a person and gota feeling she is committed to somone as evident from  pictures with a guy on social media She never accepted any of them. I  even dropped her a message asking her but she never replied.  
One fine  day(after 1 month), i asked her in person whether i am making her  uncomfortable but she said she could not recognize me on social media  and made lame excuses like she was not active. Note:She was active on  most of them and had five times the number of connections than me.  
I  decided to take a step back.I thought may be she changed her mind after  talking to me and does not want to talk further.I decided to stop the  routine and only smiled if we made accidental eye contact.Few days  later, she accepted  my request on a chatting platform.I sent her joke  regarding her excuses earlier and she laughed. Follwing this one in few  days, i tried to start a conversation through messages but she never  replied. Now, this was the breaking point for me.

I  asked herwhy does not she reply to messages for days.She made excuses  again.I told her i only wanted to talk , to which she said we are  talking.This made no sense to me.

I  decided to chuck it and never messaged her ever again.I stopped the  routine and made sure to greet her only if we were face to face.

Loop::But,  i would still catch her looking at me so many times. She would make  sure to say a loud ""hi"" when i was in a group(which everyone found  surprising) and she is passing by .She would keep a long gaze in my eyes  whenver we had an eye contact.

Loop continued for months.

Loop  was making me really uncomfortable as i had to put on that forced smile  and pretend that everything is fine.TBH, i had no interest in the thing  anymore.

I decided to stop looking at  her at all and get away from the loop .I started acting mean completely  avoiding her presence and sometimes pass through her. One fine day(after  two months of this), she stopped me while i was passing her and gave me  the news of her engagement and offered me candies she had brought to  office. I said congrats and left.  
This had happned before as well when she would stop me to offer stuff she brought which my co-workers found very strange.

98,"Hi, I'm an 18 year old guy from California, and I need lots of advice/help. To bear you from all of the details, I'll summarize the last 7 months of my life. Over 7 months ago I got kicked out of my mothers home for possessing weed, I had nowhere to go--so I ended up driving 2 hours North, to where all of my old friends live. I lived at my girlfriends (we were long-distance at the time) for a few months, followed by living at a friend's house (who eventually kicked me out as their family didn't like the idea of an 18 year old living at their house for long) and now I live at a relatives house for the time being while I figure out my life. I never finished high school, even though at the time I was actually one of the top students. As of now, I managed to find a job as a web developer (I've been programming since 8th grade), and fortunately have been making a good amount of money (a worlds better than the previous fast-food job I had to get when I first moved here). However, I'm just not sure what I'm doing, at a time in my life I was a super ambitious, hyper-motivated kid. I had a 4.7 GPA, I'd go to the gym everyday, I was heavily interested in nutrition and programming and always striving to make myself better. Now, I'm more depressed than ever before. I used to go to the gym everyday, now I'm lucky if I go twice a week. I'm always having to turn towards weed just to make myself not suicidal. I'm constantly questioning my sanity, my interests have become less interesting, I've become super attached to my girlfriend (mainly because I have no one else in my life to support me), and overall I'm essentially dying a slow death. I'm an ultra-hard worker, I've always been that way, which is why I feel like I've managed to survive on my own as well as I have, but how much longer can I be doing this? My bosses love me, I'm always working above and beyond for them (mostly because I'm so afraid of losing of my job), and fortunately they reward me for my hard work instead of taking advantage. I'm just completely lost now, I essentially have no family, no friends, just my girlfriend. I feel like I'm living my worst nightmare, I wish none of this ever happened to me. What do I do? Ever since getting my current job (which I've been doing for about 4 months now), I've gotten really good at programming, and my boss is actually looking to mentor me on ruby on rails so that I could help create programs that help run his business (my boss is a programming freak :p). I feel like the situation I'm in is a lot better than what I could be, but I still feel lost, I feel like I still haven't fully realized the situation I'm in. What do you guys think? What do you guys think I should do? I've never felt so lost before in my life, I feel I'm not even remotely the same as I was less than a year ago. How do I help myself?

101,"I am sorry but right now. I am just so fucking tired of this shit. I have like 400mg of caffeine flowing through me right now. I am sick as well, sniffing and coughing a little bit in my university’s library. I just got done applying to my literal 100th internship. I just want to get this off my chest right now.

I hate doing this. I never get anything, not a rejection. I would to get some kind of rejection, but what’s worse is that. I never hear back from anyone. I have a github. I am doing the 100 days of ML code challenge. I contribute to open source projects. I have a professional website from a startup company that I am working on with friends. I have above a 3.5 GPA from my university. My resume, my LinkedIn profile, and my cover letter have been screened by my school’s career development center. I really don’t understand this.

Well I do. The competition for internships is really fierce compared to like when you have a com sci degree already. Which is really odd. Companies don’t do internships as much, and the ones that do usually have one or two positions open and there’s like 100 candidates each. I haven’t gotten a single paid internship before.

Nobody wants me. I don’t know what else to do other go freelance.

I don’t know what you can say to me what I haven’t heard before. “Just keep applying.” Why? I have two semesters left and then I am done. The only reason I am applying to internships is because that’s what you should do as a comp sci major. But, I am tired of this. I am tired of having to prove myself when I know there’s someone more better suited than me at this job because they know C++ whereas I know typescript because I love making apps, but they desperately want someone who can fill this exact role they have. Which is weird because they say you can learn the language on the job. It doesn’t help that internships play favorite with universities, and my university is a small university deep the mountains somewhere versus one of those public ivy’s.

I even tried contacting my friends who graduated before me at some jobs and they usually say their company isn’t planning on having an internship. Sometimes, I contact a company offering a myself to do something for them. I’ve been doing Android since 2015. So, I can even help them make a android app. They’re willing to talk to me but when I mention, “hey, I will need some compensation.” They ghost me. Like? Wtf. Like, some of these companies are hundreds of miles away and they expect to fly there develop for them and not get any money for it. My university has internship program but they’re not hiring right now. I feel so ignored even when I go out of my way to call their office. Send them an email. Stop by at their desk. Nothing. Ghosted again. Not a rejection. Just nothing.

The weirdest thing happens when you’re not applying for an internship. So, when I drop my resume on careerbuilder. The very next day, recruiters call me like a 10 out 10 girl on the internet. It’s too much. They are offering themselves up. I don’t understand this. Like the thirst is real for software developers, but when it comes to interns. Nobody wants them. I guess it’s because interns have to prove themselves capable for the job. They could be a liability, because they have to learn the language and all kinds of things. However, recruiters are fascinating people. They will say, “This job posting.” “Yeah,” “This is a wishlist. I see you’re good in Java right.” “Yeah, I do android.” “That’s good enough, you can learn the rest of the languages on the job.” “Uhh, don’t you want to see my github or do you want me to do a challenge?” “Nah, so what’s your rate?” It just blows my mind how different these worlds are. So, why am I struggling over here? Why am I even bothering to do these internships? Maybe I should just go freelance. Since, after 3 years of searching, people just want to exploit me by having me work for free. Career counselors at universities give you the opposite advice on resumes that recruiters tell you. Career counselors are like: “Hey, make sure your resume is less than 1 page.” Then you talk to a recruiter, “Umm, you can have more than one page, you know?” I know why, because CS majors generally have a more stuff they can pack into a resume vs like a liberal arts major.

So, this point is just a rant. I just want to get my feelings out so I can feel better. I am going to apply to more until like the 30th of February, After that, I am calling it quits. I usually apply to 25 applications per week.

Why is this post here on this subreddit? I don’t know, man. You’re overthinking it. We’re all overthinking it. This post exist purely to exercise out all of these stupid feelings that have been building up for the past three years, and no amount of logic is going to fix that. I doubt anyone can convince me that I am wrong here, because I am not looking to be right or wrong. I wouldn’t be surprised if this post gets downvoted to oblivion.

114,"Hi all,

We are looking for adults aged 18 or over from any English speaking Western country, hoping to gain a broader perspective from a general sample. The study aims to gain further insight into the concept of self-respect which has been relatively neglected in psychological research, and its relationship with forgiveness.

You will be asked to complete an online questionnaire, which will consist of short statements on your self-respect, self-esteem and empathy. You will then be given a scenario asking you to imagine that your best friend has betrayed you and asked to indicate your feelings towards that person. None of the measures are diagnostic tools or used for therapy purposes. The study should take around 18 minutes to complete.

Your participation would be hugely appreciated, yet is completely voluntary. Only anonymous data is collected for this study. All data will be kept strictly confidential.

I let me credit get down in the VERY low 500s a few years back, because I was stupid.  I was also spending all of my money and not saving anything.

Today, I randomly checked my credit.  I check it a couple times a year.  It has jumped about 100 points in the past few months.  I paid down my credit cards all the way, and have been utilizing 1 for a lot of purchases and paying it off every statement.  I also haven't had many inquiries lately at all.  I checked it out this morning when I woke up and felt great.

Then, coincidentally a few hours later I found out I owe about $700 in personal property tax that I didn't expect to owe, and it is due by the end of this month..  In the past this would have been a huge stress to me.  Today, though, I was able to just give a little ""ope, that sucks,"" and pay it without a second thought.

124," 

It was like a punch to the gut.

""I need to say something. It's going to make you cry."" He said, voice shaky. ""Is it about us?"" I asked hesitantly. ""Yes. I'm not feeling this anymore.""

24 hours later I'm laying on my best friends couch, all of my things quickly packed up and brought over from what was to be my 'new' city, to my hometown. I was exhausted, mentally and physically, and cried myself to sleep.

48 hours past, my family and friends were checking on me, and I begun to try to make sense of what I had. I had little to my name- just enough to fill a truck and mini van- and an apartment for the next month. I had to find somewhere to sleep. I had an air mattress that wouldn't stay inflated, and the lack of solid sleeping or feeling like I had a home was getting to me. My sister helped me pick up a couch, I ordered a bed, and got a good nights sleep for the first time in a few days.

72 hours in I'm back at work, I missed two days. I feel extremely guilty for doing that to my students-they are my world. They know something is up, and when I try to casually mention I was broken up with and had to move back, they are quick to remind me of my worth and the love they have for me. It fuels my heart and keeps me moving on through the week. 

  
Its been a week. I haven't cried in a few days. My sister helps set up my new bed, I get plates, silverware, towels, and all of the little things you never think about having to need. I feel like I have sort of established myself a new home. I miss him. People ask me why we ended and I have to tell them I don't know. He just said he wasn't feeling it. The vagueness of his reason make me feel as if I'm grasping at air, and can not give myself nor others a clear answer on why my life crumbled out of nowhere.

Another week. I feel loved by family and friends that continue to check on me. Work gives me a good distraction and it is something I love. I hunt for apartments for days, finally finding the perfect one for me. I go see it, and apply, waiting for the lease to be sent over the next day. I'm still hurting, but I feel just the slightest sense of hope for my future.

72 hours. He texts saying he misses me. He's sorry. Its the biggest mistake he has ever made. He should have treated me better, he should have got help, he loves me, God, he loves me. He will move me back. He will take care of me, he wants us to be forever. My heart soars. I feel like I have taken a u-turn on the highway and I soar in the other direction.

48 hours. I spend the day checking my phone, looking for affirmations of love from him. Nothing. I get an e-mail to sign my new lease, I ignore it. It gets into the late evening and I call. ""Hey, just wanted to hear your voice. Hadn't heard from you today and thought I would."" He is distant, distracted with work he says. I ask him if he still wants to get back to gather, he said he doesn't know anymore. He's been thinking since our phone call. ""I thought everything was great, you said you loved me, you missed me and needed me, and I felt the same?!"" I say quickly, trying not to show the shakiness in my voice. He says he doesn't know anymore. He needs time to think.

24 hours. He suggest we meet on the weekend to see how things go in person. This strikes me as odd. We have lived together for two years up to two weeks ago, why would he think things would be odd between us? Nothing happened, no one cheated, was violent, hurtful, he just ended things abruptly. It was a fluke. Things can be okay now. He said he loved me. What happening? The feeling in my stomach feels familiar. Its the one I get when I don't know if he wants me around, if I'm being too loud, too needy, too distant, or overall not enough for him. I hadn't missed this feeling. It gnaws at my insides, and I wonder, is this what I want to go back to? Wondering if I am enough? Wondering if I will spend my evening and and weekends waiting to see what sort of mood he is in. Will I receive attention, acknowledgement? Or quietly distract myself with a movie or book, living in a home with another person but feeling alone, God, so alone. I don't miss this, I realize.

I spend the next day not checking my phone. I know I will find nothing there, no good mornings, how are you's, the like. It was only like that in the first few months, and I kid myself to think it will happen again. I know this road we are both trying to get back on. It is a dead end. I am willing to put in the work, push through, paving forward, but I know I can't do it alone. I know I shouldn't have to do it alone, no matter how willing I am. I love him, God, I love him, but I need to love myself. The idea of meeting the next day fills me with dread. He will not be the boy I met and miss. He will be who he was, 336 hours, telling me he didn't feel like being with me anymore. It takes everything in me to message him, and tell him I can't do this if he isn't in it 100%. I deserve that. Its taken me 10 years of various relationships to see that, but I am slowly learning my worth. I let him know I deserve someone who loves me, that love not varying on the day or hour. I deserve someone that will work as hard as I will to have a happy life and relationship. I want to not doubt my worth and love based on another responses. I don't want to feel like I have to walk on eggshells or beg for scraps of attention.

It takes everything in me to stand up for what I'm worth, and when I send it, I turn off my phone. I just want a few more minutes, just a few seconds of pretending he will say he is sorry, he loves me unconditionally and will meet me halfway in everything we do.

But he can't.   
And it's over, again.

I take a deep breath, counting the seconds, feeling the minutes. And taking solace in knowing that eventually, time heals all wounds.",14Feb2019,1
125,"I'm 19.
When I have a crush on someone, I find it difficult to express anything other than anger. I have 0 confidence when it comes to approaching people I like but when they do something that makes me angry, I become so tempted to express it and that usually leads to my crushes believing that I dislike them. I think it's because it's the only intense emotion I can easily express towards a crush, and I've had this problem since middle school, but it was worse. I used to talk badly about them and always pick up fights. Maybe it was out of fear that they find out, and I get badly rejected. It's kind of a defense mechanism. But I kinda grew up with that habit. Whenever they do something annoying that's worth being angry over, I want to lash out at them or send out an angry text (not a paragraph juste a short passive aggressive message) but I don't end up doing it ofc, that's childish. however, I don't think I would do that with another person, I wouldn't even care that much or usually I'll just forget about it. But the freaking need I feel to talk shit about my crush, and I feel satisfied. But it's wrong and it just projects my insecurities. I asked my friends if they do that and they don't. It's such an intense emotion that I feel it physically. Sometimes I cant even do anything because I get too angry. Maybe if I made moves and didn't have a pile of insecurities and was able to show interest in people I wouldn't be this tempted to tell a crush to go fuck himself.
I know it's weird, please don't judge. This has probably got to do with how I treat my parents too. For example, I can only converse with my dad easily when I'm angry at them and I'm complaining. I grew up with it and I want to change",14Feb2019,1

129,"Some background: I work in the medical field as a civilian for the military.

A few months ago I was in a very serious car accident that resulted in me being in the hospital for a few days and out of work for a month and a half. I'm doing much better now but I'm still really shaken up and trying to get back to normal.

Everyone at work knows about my accident including our HR representative who stops by my department every now and then. Before the accident we would make small talk and the usual pleasantries but I didn't interact with him much.

Ever since I got back to work he has made fun of me whenever he sees me. He's started calling me ""Crash"" and making car crash noises when I'm around.

He'll ask me if I'm driving yet and when I tell him I'm not ready to get back on the road he'll roll his eyes or make some sort of remark. He's said he's glad I'm not driving yet because he doesn't want me to run into him on the road.

I told him that I wasn't at fault for the accident and that I don't find his ""jokes"" funny but he'll just brush me off.

I've been avoiding him when I see him and I'll be moving overseas in a month for a new job so I won't have to deal with it for much longer.

Mostly I just wanted to vent and see if anyone has any advice on how to handle this situation. Since I'll be moving soon I figure I should just ignore him and wait it out, but I'm also worried that I'm being too sensitive or overdramatic.

I don’t want to sound like a neck beard or anything but I just feel like I’m in a big funk right now.

133,"A friend of mine committed suicide last week. He wasn’t even 16 yet, and here I am making plans to attend his funeral. This is hard enough for his friends and peers, but God forbid anyone has to endure the pain that his family feels right now. 

A child without parents is considered an orphan. Someone who lost their spouse is “widowed”. However, there is no word for a parent who has lost their child, because this shouldn’t be possible. There is a Japanese saying that roughly translates to “The grey-haired should never have to bury the dark-haired”. It is against the natural balance of things. 

To those with suicidal thoughts or problems: 
You are not alone. No matter how deep in the rabbit hole of depression you may be, know that you are never truly without someone who cares for you. Everyone you know, and even those of don’t, is affected by your decision. My friend who ended his life brought about days of silence at our school, and numerous prayers at the flagpole on his behalf. There is always someone to talk to, and there are always people willing to help you through your problems. Suicide should never be the answer, and suicidal thoughts should never enter your head; much less a bullet. Whatever your struggle, winning the fight is so much more worth it than losing.

To the friends or loved ones of those with suicidal thoughts: 
Over the past few days, I’ve seen countless posts online from friends about how “they’re always there when someone needs to talk”. While I appreciate this sentiment, as I’m sure most others do, it shouldn’t have to come to an actual event occurring for prevention efforts to surface. No victim should have to become a martyr in order to produce change. If you have a friend or loved one that you are concerned about, please let them know you are there for them, before it is too late. It will mean the world for them to know that they are not alone in their fight, and at times, it might even be the difference between pulling through, or pulling the trigger.

Started dating a guy I suddenly fell for, he wasn't right for me but he treated me well and I needed it, ofc it ended up being delusional and I got surrounded by sadness/rage/all kind of stuff I grew during the previous relationship.
Breaking up with my ex caused me to lose most of my friends, I ended up spending the summer (including my bday) alone and struggling to find myself again, while my bff was too busy enjoying her new crush to really notice how I was breaking apart.
At some point we got into a huge argument and took separated ways, lately I found out she turned into an a-hole and cut off everyone but her new friends. Needless to say I feel the urge to cover the tattoo we got together (12years long friendship).
In January I lost the job I loved due to burocracy issues.
There were also positive things. I started hitting the gym a year ago, met new people, got new friends, dated some guys and I kept improving myself in any possible way.
