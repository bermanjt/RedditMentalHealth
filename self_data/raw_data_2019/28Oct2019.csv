1,"I’ve reached a breaking point in my mental health, and am very open to the idea of therapy, but I have no idea how to even approach receiving it.

I live in a rural area where there are limited options (especially considering this is a very Christian/conservative area). I tried google searching therapist/psychiatrists/whatever other related word I could find, and nothing really stood out to me. A lot of the People/places I could find had either bad reviews, or not a lot of information for me to go off of. The idea of therapy is great and all, but potentially wasting money on someone who doesn’t actually give a shit about what they’re doing is a little scary to me. 

What do I even look for? Who am I looking for?? I know the main difference between the types is that psychiatrists can prescribe medication, as therapists can’t (I think?) Outside of that, I’m just taking a wild guess that psychologists are more about the studying people than actually treating them, and counselors seem like a joke (but please correct me). Is there one that’s better than the other? One to avoid?

Are there means to find more therapists and therapy options in my area than a crappy google search (like a real estate agent to a home)? I’m very lost in the whole subject.",28Oct2019,2
2,"I (33M)moved to my wife’s (35F)home town (small town) approx 10 years ago I have lived in the city most of my life and I believe because of the population of city’s never had a hard time making friends. I have found small town life comfortable but in the social front entrench difficult, the social groups here are very cliquey (like high school) and because I didn’t grow up here and I don’t play hockey I’m the odd man out it feels. Like I said I’ve never had a hard time making friends before I feel that I’m fairly charismatic and not overly obnoxious. At this point I have kind of accepted that fact that all my good friends live away and that’s the way it will always be it just seems odd. Does anyone else have similar experience? Or a point of view from the other side?",28Oct2019,1
3,Like not in a depressing way. I want to live out my life. But being dead means you're truly at peace. In the void. Life is so cool.,28Oct2019,4
4,"I want to kill myself because I might just be the dumbest motherfucker alive. I feel a mix of shame and guilt, because my ancestors didn't die for this shit.

It's not hurting or anything, but it bled a lot. It was near the base of the penis, a little to the right. I got flappy skin and its color is worrying me, because it's getting a little dark. There is no foul smell, the wound is not hurting and weird goo is not coming out of the wound, so I guess that's alright.

Bleeding is controlled too. I'm changing bandages every 4 hours or so, but I think that's hurting more than it's helping.

I made an appointment with an urologist tomorrow, because I'm worried about the flappy skin bit. I really don't want to go, but I searched ""flappy dark skin"" and now I'm worried about gangrene and shit. I know that if I'm worried about that I should go to the ER, but what the fuck am I supposed to say?

""Hey receptionist, I got flappy dark skin because I cut myself, it might be gangrene. How I managed to do that? Electric clippers. What's that? I'm a waste of my father's semen? What's that? There's people being shot or stabbed or about to die of appendicitis and I'm going to waste precious time and resources because of my dick's flappy skin? What's that? You do hope it is gangrene?""

You can go ahead and ridicule me, but while we're at it I'm also going to vent about my shitty life, this incident was like putting salt in the dick wound.

My life sucked four years ago, and it still sucks now. I think it sucks more, despite all the hard work I've done to make it better. Had to move away from my family because they're crazy fucking cultists. Jehovah's Witnesses. The amount of crazy shit I heard in my childhood and teen years really messed me up. I'm incapable of forming long lasting relationships, and my family shuns me because I don't believe their weird dogmas anymore. It tore my family apart. When my favourite uncle left the religion, I was forced to stop talking to him, and I really looked up to him. He was the smartest guy I knew and felt like I could talk to him about anything, more so than my own father.

And then there's the fact I've always been sick. Suffered from malabsorption syndrome. Changed my diet I don't know how many fucking times. Had to take shitloads of vitamins. Only 6 months ago I weighed 51kg (that's rounding up), with 172cm of height.

I finally found a decent meal plan and managed to get to 60kg, low body fat too, about 8%.

I had to take so many shitty, dead end jobs to get by before I learned programming and got a real job. I was treated worse than a stray dog.

And I've gotten better at talking with people. I've made some friends at work, but at the end of the day they still have their shit going on, and I'm always home alone. On weekends, all I do is eat the stuff I'm supposed to so I can get results at the gym. That's it. 

I eat, go back to bad. Get up, eat something else, watch something dumb. Go to bed. Get up, eat. Study for some hours, eat. Go to bed. Get up, eat, watch something for 2 hours or so, eat, shower, sleep. Then for the weekdays I get to talk to people and keep myself occupied so I don't think about my pathetic life.

I've been thinking about suicide on a daily basis and I cry myself to sleep every two or three days.

Honestly, I hope this freaking flappy, hanging skin is infected and just kills me already. This fucking life.",28Oct2019,0

It feels weird and I don't know where to start. Right now I feel like I don't have much of a personality. I'm nice and I make funny jokes, but that's about it. Pretty lame. What am I supposed to do?

9,"I was raised a Muslim, in a Muslim household, but since then (4 years ago) I became atheist. 

At first, I was the kind of super edgy atheist who was incredibly angry at my parents for raising my with religion, and angry at all religious people. Although now, since about a years ago, I have matured and can come to see the positive aspects of my Muslim background. 

My former religion was preached equality between those of all races, at a time when non-whites were vilified. It taught moderation and mindfulness, and effective ways at dealing with low emotions in encouraging community and familial connections, as opposed to turning to alcohol. I suspect this, my support and lack of drinking as a teen is the reason why I have not become alcoholic as a now young adult. 

My father and mother taught me good values which is to respect and love one another, work hard, and provide for your family. My father especially was liberal, and we had family friends of all religious and ethnic backgrounds. Although my dad wanted my sister and I to wear hijab (headscarf) growing up, he gave us the freedom to study and live abroad. Because Islam does encourage the pursuit of education. 

I do believe the good values I attempt my best to adhere to now, are a result of my parents’ good upbringing of my siblings and I. Yet, I do not believe in the idea of a god at all. How do I come to terms with this all? Is it possible to acknowledge that religion can have some positive and decent teachings to it, her still be atheist?

11,"People kept telling me I need to get off my lazy ass and get a god damned job, so I decided to look up local jobs in my area and it turns out my area is short on ER nurses this time of the year, and it paid decently enough, so I thought to myself ''why not?''

I was involved in numerous pregnancies and caring for countless women whose waters were broke. It was pretty routine. That was until yesterday when I got a call from paramedics.

''We have a special case here, but I think you're up for the job.'' - He said in a hopeful tone of voice. I was unsure of what was yet to face me, but I was determined. Oh, was I determined!

I see the body of what appeared to be an unusually pallor man strapped to an ambulance gurney. They are rushing him out as if Kim Jong Un had blew a load. As the gurney is pushed into the ward, I notice a most remarkable sight. The pallor man was a nerd with huge glasses. A nerdy man, that is. He was groaning and whining and clenching his stomach, which appeared abnormally pot-bellied considering how skinny he was.

''What is it this time?'' I told the paramedics.

''He is in labor!'' The woman paramedic yelled.

Right away we hooked him up to an IV since he had symptoms of internal bleeding. We could not determine if this was from normal menstruation or otherwise, or if the child was ravaging him from the inside out.

''Get that goddamn child out of him!'' - suddenly a 4'7'', 200 lb, black, ebonics-speaking woman in a white coat and unkempt afro yelled at all of us in the ward. It was Dr. Jacobs. She began preparing anesthesia masks and injections. At this point, we could see veins popping out of the nerd's hands and forehead.

''It's an ectopic pregnancy I think, we need to perform a cesarean right now!'' - Dr. Jacobs was moving faster than a fly on cocaine. I'd never seen her this hurried.

''An ectopic pregnancy?'' I questioned.

''Bitch! Don't you know how dangerous this could be? To all of us?!'' She yelled right in my face as the nerd was now knocked out from anesthesia gas.

We all stood back, but before Dr. Jacobs could make an incision she stood back herself.

''Oh god, they're coming!'' - We gasped in shock and horror as the nerd's abdomen began to churn and visibly move up and down. Suddenly, the nerd let out a roar in pain, even under anesthesia. Blood was everywhere and covered our eyes before we could even process it.

We slowly wiped off all the blood, pus and discharge out of our eyes, faces and hair. We looked down in shock as six baby nerds were now on the floor, complete with horn rimmed glasses and bowties! They began to maul Dr. Jacobs to death and before we could get hold of a fire extinguisher to use as a weapon, she was just blood and bones. The nerds looked at us and gnashed their teeth and thighs.

We decided to sell them to a school for gifted children. Dr. Jacob's death was ruled as misadventure.",28Oct2019,0

Fucking at work as well as fucking in general are taboo. I think that’s what turns me on. Today I fucked my co worker (we’ve had sex few times before, at home) in a maintenance closet of my hotel where we work. I saw her in the break room, and told her to just come here. We took the elevator up to the top floor, and I opened the closet. There was like, a bucket on the ground. She sat on it and I just dropped my pants to my ankles, I was already aroused on the elevator ride up. I was really hard, and she gripped her lips on my penis, and bobbed her head back and forth, wetting my penis. She couldn’t really go passed half of my dick so I was trying to force it deeper, she was gagging but she wouldn’t move away. I was getting harder than what I already was, and loved seeing her struggle on my hard member. I told I wanted to fuck. She got up, pulled her pants down and put her hands on the bucket, bending over. I put my dick in her and god it was amazing. I was so hard and I was pounding her very hard, but with long methodical deep strokes. I loved watching the ripples on her round ass, and how big my dick looked compared to her entire ass. I was gripping her thighs, back legs, ass, everything.  I love the simple fact that she was just, bending over, pants halfway down taking dick in a closet at her place of employment. It was the hottest thing ever. One of my co workers radio’d me to report to the front desk for a task, during the pounding.  I told her to “throw it back on me”, I reached for the radio and told em I’ll be there in just a sec. I spent the next three minutes thrusting my hips in a certain motion, resulting in me feeling the skin of her bare ass press against me, turning me on. She said she was cumming, and I felt her get wetter and wetter. It was so good, god. I sped up, pulled out and came over her ass. I made her clean her cum off of my penis with her mouth, and i got myself together, told her to leave like 20 seconds after me and carried on about my day. I was hard for the rest of the work day and wanted to take her back there and have me sit on the bucket while she squats up and down on my dick.",28Oct2019,0

21,"I am the kind of person where everything I do serves a purpose. If I eat, it is because I know I am lacking in specific nutrients and my diet will change to reflect what my body needs. If I do drugs its because I am looking for the specific effect of whatever drug I'm taking and I supplement it to reduce the negative effects. For example, if I were to do cocaine, I would be looking for that hyper aware and excessively cognizant feeling where everything gets processed quicker, and I would supplement it with marijuana to ease the harshness of the comedown.

This translates into a number of areas of my life. 

I seek relationships, not always romantic, but relationships with people who will benefit me. Since you cant have parasitic relationships without being an asshole, I have tried to nudge myself in the direction of general usefulness. I can cook, I can lift, I can babysit, etc.

I just want to feel a woman again... one who cares and not about my money or my adventurousness because neither of those things are things I have yet. I just want to be held. I want to feel vulnerable and to have a woman who wants to be vulnerable with me. Someone with a sultry personality, a calm, collected anger, and a neverending sex drive.

&amp;#x200B;

Upon hearing the latter, I begun to slip into a state of depression. This kind of depression feels a little different from the rest. It was no longer me being depressed about myself and my past experiences, but it was for another person that holds value in my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

She's a tough woman. All the women in my family are tough. Coming here as immigrants and starting from scratch is no easy feat. I know she will persist and try to make ends meet. But with the many uncertain variables  that life has to offer, I don't know how much longer she can persist.

I have an interest to study health again but am skeptical of my chances at landing a job in the field, This may not the most financially stable route and will be definitely be the more selfish. I fear the unknown and the uncertainty of my future with this decision.

The other decision is to become a licensed welder and be my dads partner. As my mums physiological health is in a state of decline, my father will have more difficulty running his business. He has his own balustrade business that has been run by himself for the past 10 years. I feel this decision will be a holistically better decision. I can help my dad with his business, can help my family pay off the mortgage and secure financial stability. But, the con of this decision is that I absolutely fucking hate it. I don't like a thing about construction. Walking onto a job site and observing the conditions is the most depressing thing about it to me.

The general concept is that modern/stadium country, or what I've heard other people call ""bro country"", is all written by people who use certain words or phrases to pander to the audience; all the while not having any real or meaningful connection to the subject matter. For example from the song: ""I write songs about riding tractors from the comfort of a private jet"" and ""I have private ranch that I barely use... I don't like dirt"". 

I find that most of the artists/songs on the country radio station in my area sound disingenuous at best. They don't sound honest. They write songs about dirt roads but have lived in big cities their whole lives, songs about farming or tractors and have never worked on a farm a day in their lives, talk about hunting and fishing but only ever get their meat from a grocery store, and make countless and unending references to actual country music legends while shitting all over everything those legends lived and died for.",28Oct2019,89

30,"So guys, this is my first reddit and I’m not sure how it works yet. But here’s something I’m struggling with and want advice for. 
So there was this guy, let’s name him T. I liked him before summer break and my crush on him has been going on for a while now. However, he would always tell me he had a crush on someone but he would never tell me who it was. I had a tiny guess that it was me but I quickly shut down my idea. This was because he wouldn’t really take the initiative in starting a conversation (idk if it’s because he is shy) and he didn’t show any signs that liked me... He would talk to me over summer too but we couldn’t hang out one-on-one because I was overseas. I asked him to go to the beach when I get back and (later I found out from his best friend) he was excited about hanging out with me. That friend-date went well, but school started getting stressful and I we didn’t have any shared classes so we started talking less. Homecoming was around the corner and I was hoping he would ask me. I waited and waited but he didn’t ask me. I turned down multiple other people in the process of waiting and I felt really bad. There was this other guy that really liked me at the time. Let’s name him C. C asked me to homecoming in the cutest way possible. (He practiced a piano song which he sang to and bought me a really cute soft toy with homecoming attached to it. ) I was moved and decided to say yes. Later on, things were going pretty well with me and C. I wouldn’t say I liked him a lot, but he made me feel happy. So when C decided to ask me out, I agreed. We had this try-out period of dating where we see if we are compatible, and in the end we weren’t. (And this was largely because our personality clashed and also because I didn’t get over T completely yet) After homecoming however, people were coming up to me and calling me a bitch for disregarding T’s feelings for me. And they told me how he wanted to ask me to homecoming but backed off because I already agreed to C. I had no idea that the crush T was referring to was me. And I was extremely sad when I found out. During the process of me dating C (lasted 1 month), T kind of got over me. We have a shared friend group so we went to halloween horror nights together and I told him my feelings for him ( we were a little drunk), and I don’t think he remember (even if he did he didn’t do anything about it) We had this hour long ft a few days later where I asked him to tell me his honest opinions about us. He said he really liked me but can’t date because of school. His best friend however, told me that T liked me as more a good friend. I’m really confused but I know I want T back. I know school is stressful (especially for our school) and I know T is tired all the time, but I still want him to be more affectionate with me. Though this kind of sounds pathetic, but I really enjoy being with him. I don’t know how to get him to like me again.

37,"The story goes like this: Sometime in the 1940s, Enrico Fermi was talking about the possibility of extraterrestrial intelligence with some other physicists. They were impressed that life had evolved quickly and progressively on Earth. They figured our galaxy holds about 100 billion stars, and that an intelligent, exponentially-reproducing species could colonize the galaxy in just a few million years. They reasoned that extraterrestrial intelligence should be common by now. Fermi listened patiently, then asked, simply, “So, where is everybody?” That is, if extraterrestrial intelligence is common, why haven’t we met any bright aliens yet? This conundrum became known as Fermi’s Paradox.
Since then, the Paradox has become ever more baffling. Paleontology has shown that organic life evolved quickly after the Earth’s surface cooled and became life-hospitable. Given simple life forms, evolution shows progressive trends toward larger bodies, brains, and social complexity. Evolutionary psychology has revealed several credible paths from simpler social minds to human-level creative intelligence. So evolving intelligence seems likely, given a propitious habitat—and astronomers think such habitats are common. Moreover, at least 150 extrasolar planets have been identified in the last few years, suggesting that life-hospitable planets orbit most stars. Yet 40 years of intensive searching for extraterrestrial intelligence have yielded nothing: no radio signals, no credible spacecraft sightings, no close encounters of any kind.
It looks, then, as if we can answer Fermi in two ways. Perhaps our current science over-estimates the likelihood of extraterrestrial intelligence evolving. Or, perhaps evolved technical intelligence has some deep tendency to be self-limiting, even self-exterminating. After Hiroshima, some suggested that any aliens bright enough to make colonizing space ships would be bright enough to make thermonuclear bombs, and would use them on each other sooner or later. Maybe extraterrestrial intelligence always blows itself up. Indeed, Fermi’s Paradox became, for a while, a cautionary tale about Cold War geopolitics.
I suggest a different, even darker solution to the Paradox. Basically, I think the aliens don’t blow themselves up; they just get addicted to computer games. They forget to send radio signals or colonize space because they’re too busy with runaway consumerism and virtual-reality narcissism. They don’t need Sentinels to enslave them in a Matrix; they do it to themselves, just as we are doing today. Once they turn inwards to chase their shiny pennies of pleasure, they lose the cosmic plot. They become like a self-stimulating rat, pressing a bar to deliver electricity to its brain’s ventral tegmental area, which stimulates its nucleus accumbens to release dopamine, which feels…ever so good.
The fundamental problem is that an evolved mind must pay attention to indirect cues of biological fitness, rather than tracking fitness itself. This was a key insight of evolutionary psychology in the early 1990s; although evolution favors brains that tend to maximize fitness (as measured by numbers of great-grandkids), no brain has capacity enough to do so under every possible circumstance. Evolution simply could never have anticipated the novel environments, such as modern society, that our social primate would come to inhabit. That would be a computationally intractable problem, even for the new IBM Blue Gene/L supercomputer that runs 280 trillion operations per second. Even long-term weather prediction is easy when compared to fitness prediction. As a result, brains must evolve short-cuts: fitness-promoting tricks, cons, recipes and heuristics that work, on average, under ancestrally normal conditions.
The result is that we don’t seek reproductive success directly; we seek tasty foods that have tended to promote survival, and luscious mates who have tended to produce bright, healthy babies. The modern result? Fast food and pornography. Technology is fairly good at controlling external reality to promote real biological fitness, but it’s even better at delivering fake fitness—subjective cues of survival and reproduction without the real-world effects. Having real friends is so much more effort than watching Friends. Actually colonizing the galaxy would be so much harder than pretending to have done it when filming Star Wars or Serenity. The business of humanity has become entertainment, and entertainment is the business of feeding fake fitness cues to our brains.
Fitness-faking technology tends to evolve much faster than our psychological resistance to it. With the invention of the printing press, people read more and have fewer kids. (Only a few curmudgeons lament this.) With the invention of Xbox 360, people would rather play a high-resolution virtual ape in Peter Jackson’s King Kong than be a perfect-resolution real human. Teens today must find their way through a carnival of addictively fitness-faking entertainment products: iPods, DVDs, TiVo, Sirius Satellite Radio, Motorola cellphones, the Spice channel, EverQuest, instant messaging, MDMA, BC bud. The traditional staples of physical, mental and social development—athletics, homework, dating—are neglected. The few young people with the self-control to pursue the meritocratic path often get distracted at the last minute. Take, for example, the MIT graduates who apply to do computer game design for Electronics Arts, rather than rocket science for NASA.
Around 1900, most inventions concerned physical reality: cars, airplanes, Zeppelins, electric lights, vacuum cleaners, air conditioners, bras, zippers. In 2005, most inventions concern virtual entertainment—the top 10 patent-recipients were IBM, Canon, Hewlett-Packard, Matsushita, Samsung, Micron Technology, Intel, Hitachi, Toshiba and Fujitsu—not Boeing, Toyota or Victoria’s Secret. We have already shifted from a reality economy to a virtual economy, from physics to psychology as the value-driver and resource-allocator. We are already disappearing up our own brainstems. Our neurons over-stimulate each other, promiscuously, as our sperm and eggs decay, unused. Freud’s pleasure principle triumphs over the reality principle. Today we narrow-cast human-interest stories to each other, rather than broadcasting messages of universal peace and progress to other star systems.
Maybe the bright aliens did the same. I suspect that a certain period of fitness-faking narcissism is inevitable after any intelligent life evolves. This is the Great Temptation for any technological species—to shape their subjective reality to provide the cues of survival and reproductive success without the substance. Most bright alien species probably go extinct gradually, allocating more time and resources to their pleasures, and less to their children. They eventually die out when the game behind all games—the Game of Life—says “Game Over; you are out of lives and you forgot to reproduce.”
Heritable variation in personality might allow some lineages to resist the Great Temptation and last longer. Some individuals and families may start with an “irrational” Luddite abhorrence of entertainment technology, and they may evolve ever more self-control, conscientiousness and pragmatism. They will evolve a horror of virtual entertainment, psychoactive drugs and contraception. They will stress the values of hard work, delayed gratifica tion, child-rearing and environmental stewardship. They will combine the family values of the religious right with the sustainability values of the Greenpeace left. Their concerns about the Game of Life will baffle the political pollsters who only understand the rhetoric of status and power, individual and society, rights and duties, good and evil, us and them.
This, too, may be happening already. Christian and Muslim fundamentalists and anti-consumerism activists already understand exactly what the Great Temptation is, and how to avoid it. They insulate themselves from our creative-class dreamworlds and our EverQuest economics. They wait patiently for our fitness-faking narcissism to go extinct. Those practical-minded breeders will inherit the Earth as like-minded aliens may have inherited a few other planets. When they finally achieve contact, it will not be a meeting of novel-readers and game-players. It will be a meeting of dead-serious super-parents who congratulate each other on surviving not just the Bomb, but the Xbox. ",28Oct2019,2

39,"This post is racist. I admit that upfront and I don't give a shit.

White people are clearly superior, at least aesthetically. Their noses are small and dainty, they have delicate, porcelain features, and hair/eye colors that aren't the typical, boring ass black/brown. I'm fed up with looking around and seeing so many beautiful white girls with light hair and eyes. I feel BORING and COMMON in comparison. I have super dark brown hair and eyes, and olive skin. It's not that I necessarily think these colors are ugly, they're just dull. Blue eyes, for instance, are striking as hell, and prove that you have rare genetics. 

Another disadvantage to having a darker complexion is the fucking UGLY hair that grows all over your body!!! White girls can get away with not shaving for a few days, but if I don't shave? I have very VISIBLE dark hairs growing out of my legs, and sometimes even upper lip. Dark skin is disgusting, and dark hair/eyes are plain. I just hate everything about my appearance. I'm glad I'm not disabled and I'm grateful to have a functioning body, but goddam, sometimes this pain just hurts so much. I think I'm going to go cry myself to sleep now. Maybe I'll wake up feeling better. But then, of course, the cycle will repeat itself all over again the next night.",28Oct2019,0

I turn to reddit and I get drawn into social and political subs. I feel the need to voice my opinion into the void in a nasty fucking way when i see something i dont like. rinse and repeat. i must have had at least 15 accounts in the last 4 years. on one account i made it to 26000 karma before deleting. i say that so you get a better understanding.

i think im a good person. i look around me in the coffee shop and everyone is so friendly. men and women are going about their day in peace. all i see are good people. i wonder if some of these same people jump on reddit and talk complete shit like i do. 

so i dno what causes this, or better, i dno how to stop doing it short of not having a smart phone anymore. dont tell me to seek therapy. its not that bad. im just tired of the negativity. i gota change my habbits. 

I feel no accountability to my words here. i truly dont give a fuck what i write about. i delete my accounts because why not. do you think what you write on reddit means anything at all? does it have any impact?

everywhere i look its us vs them. democrats vs republicans, men vs women, communism vs capitalism, liberal vs conservative, antifa vs the proud boys, white people vs black people and i could go on. are you all seeing the same thing?

Do you know what it feels like to feel so worthless that you truly believe the best you deserve is abuse? Have you looked at someone with so much love and hope only to have them despise you. I laugh and I joke, but I’ve been called a slut, a whore, disgusting, dirty and the devil. I have been so ashamed of myself that I believed I already had the best thing I would ever get. I believed the only time I would ever hear I love you would be a lie. I was embarrassed and ashamed of myself. I accepted the toxicity because love is blind. I thought I loved someone because they manipulated me into believing it. I stayed with you because I thought that I deserved to be called those things. I still think I deserve those things. I believe that you are the best and worst thing that ever happened to me. Your love made me feel whole when I couldn’t complete myself. When I was so broken from previous trauma, you glued me back together. You gave me ambition and a desire to change the world. You challenged my views and helped me create my identity. You also ruined me. I wake up every day, second guessing myself. I ask if it was my fault. If I did this to us. If I deserved the relationship I was in. Maybe you were my one, and it just so happens that my one was abusive. I’m twenty now. I’m supposed to find love and maybe get married. At least that’s what I want. I want to adopt kids like I always told you. I’m afraid. I’m afraid that I will never adopt kids because I’ll never find someone to love me like you did. I’ll never find someone to accept my past and my future. I worry I’ll never find someone who respects my boundaries because you told me I never would.

Anyway, I made a friend a few days ago when my block mates and I decided to go out for a drink. Apparently, this new friend of mine happened to be in the same college as I was and graduated in the same high school as well, but he is much older than me by a few years. I felt relieved when I found this out considering that it has been a struggle to find someone in my college to connect with because of certain cultural barriers that I possess. You see, I graduated from a high school that has a very different culture compared to the college I'm in right now. Because of this, there had been complications as to how I was able to adapt to the type of people that were in my course and also, to the way they learn, socialize, communicate, etc. Up until today, I have never felt like I belonged in this college, but I am still making efforts into solving this issue.  So meeting this guy who happens to be an alumni from my old high school was like a light within the darkness. I knew right away that talking to him and asking him all the questions I could think of relating to his experience with adapting to the culture was an opportunity I couldn't just let go.  I had a fun night not because of the humor and the stories or even the amount of alcohol we've consumed, but because of the insights I was able to gather from this new friend. He told me what to do, say and think in certain situations that would lead to common cultural dilemmas. Among all the pieces of advice that he gave me during that night, the one thing that stuck to me the most was this: ""Always be a yes man to every opportunity"". Hearing this, I made a decision to start joining orgs and activities more regardless of what I think of them because at the end of the day, I've got nothing to lose and everything to gain.",28Oct2019,3

I just feel like I constantly let myself and let people down. Can't stick to simple routines like getting to bed by certain time or waking up by certain times. I try to implement micro habits like clean my room for 5 mins a day...etc. extremely simple things but I just can't keep things going. 

Freelance writing job started fine but then I procrastinated and ended up not meeting deadlines I could meet. Then I rushed my work and did a poor job even though I promised more and I was capable to do more. 

It's a continuous vicious cycle of setting goals -&gt; feeling good about them -&gt; breaking them -&gt; hating myself. 

I find no purpose in my current job because I don't believe in the products it tries to sell. Every day I dread going to work and feel disgusted whenever the boss starts yet another ad-hoc meeting about changes we need to make at the workplace. I have been taking days off because I just don't want to go to work but then not being productive. So I end up losing a day of pay for nothing.  

The only thing that I managed recently is applying and doing random ad-hoc jobs like paid interviews and voice recordings. Simple things. I haven't done the job application test I should be doing nor proper job applications. I think I have a commitment issue. Even though I know what needs to be done, for unknown reasons, I just can't.

54,"So I (f 20) was sleeping next to my bf(m 20) at the time. When we were getting ready for bed I was super tired way more so than usual and I said ""hey no sex tonight"" I specifically said this because I know that he wants sex in the middle of the night and I didn't want him to wake me up. He said okay and we whent to bed in the same bed as we did all the time because I was letting him stay with me for a little bit. 

I passed out super fast and woke up to it happening he was in me thrusting and on top of me. I was so tired and when I opened my eyes I saw him the guy I loved. I was so tired the moment I saw it was him I fell asleep again, because that's how much trust I put in him. He wouldn't hurt me he's my bf. I was stupid but saying that now won't change anything. 

Fast forward to about a month later he cheated on me and it broke my heart so I broke up with him. Later I was talking to a friend and she had to tell me what happened because I couldn't figure it out on my own. I knew somthing was wrong, I kept thinking of the night, how it fucked me up on my drive home from work. Rape this whole time it was a rape. 

Finally one fight with my mom sent me over the edge. She constantly tries to pretend she knows every little thing about me. I told her at first she didn't understand thru the sobbing and she got mad at me. I eventually calmed down enough to tell her how it happened and the first the she says is sorry, the second thing she says it ""it could have been worse"". 

I didn't take that well altho she is right he didn't cut me or put wierd stuff in me but he betrayed me. I haven't told any other family members but I think I should? I might get something helpful, my aunt is a social worker so she might have some magical info that'll help me idk. I don't even know why I'm making this post I guess I'm hoping it'll help somehow?

I can still have fun and be happy, if that makes sense. Anyway, my partner who I live with of one year told me I need to be more open about it. So I’ve tried really hard to do so. 

Whilst he’s on holiday in another country I asked if we were okay and he basically said that he needs space to do other things and that he feels like I talk about my mental health too much. I’m devastated. He said we need to spend more time going out and the thing is I do, I try really hard. I go to things with him but not alll the time. Sometimes I just want to spend time with him at home instead but he wants us to be more social. I’ve spent my whole life being the stoic person, never talking about it except to my therapist. He knows this. And now he’s telling me this and I feel like crawling back up again and disappearing. I know he’s saying he wants to see friends more and do other things but god, what am I supposed to do in my position? I’m trying so hard.

I am a very boring person. And I never have much to say for myself. I don't have any hobbies. I don't retain all that much information. We loved each other and lived together for a year, so we got by on day-to-day chitchat. But we both hate smalltalk. He has an overactive imagination, he always had something to say. He'd say what he saw, he'd share the wonderfully colourful thoughts his random-ass-brain would come up with. I loved it. But could never contribute to these colours he brought to our conversations.

I'd try so hard to think of something interesting to say, but my mind would panic and shut down from the pressure I put on myself. 

I'm now sat in a car with my sister, silent. I have nothing to share. Nothing to stimulate conversation.

Same with other people, I can hold a conversation. I can respond. It's not a social anxiety thing.

This isn't just an incompatible with this person thing, it's not like I just need to find someone I click with. It's me as a person, I feel like I'm lacking something everyone else must have.

Hello Everyone, I have been confused about my girlfriends behaviour. Can you all tell me if these are the signs of toxic relationships. I’ll put down couple of points: a) She wants me to stay connected 24/7. And if I delay in replying or calling back while I’m stuck at work she starts fighting. Initially I used to explain things to her but this behaviour never stopped. I started feeling fearful if get stuck and unable to reply that I’ll have to face the fight again. She use to say stuffs like If you don’t want to talk then tell me you don’t want to talk. For this reason I started telling her in advance that I’m gonna get stuck for a while. But this has started giving me anxiety. b) Once I was in my office party she started calling and saying I’ll hop into the cab and come there. Whom you are with? I was constantly texting her and telling her my whereabouts. I just went to dance with my colleagues for while and couldn’t text. I got so pissed off with this behaviour that I too shouted at her. I started feeling suffocated. She once said I lowered my standards by being with you. I got really hurt on this because I don’t expect to hear something like that from her. With all of this behaviour I too started fighting with her often. I started loosing affection for her. She used to say something or the other and then become fine after a while saying lovy dovy things and cuddling but these fights and used to affect me a lot. And I was unable to reciprocate in the way I used to before. I have become unsure about her now. I’m confused weather all of this behaviour is out of love or I’m actually dealing with a toxic person. These is been asking for marriage thing for the past one year. I’m confused to ahead with the same. Offcourse apart from above we have shared beautiful moments as well which we both have cherished. But because of above  I have actually become negative towards her. Is it fine to say yes to marriage. I’m confused.",28Oct2019,1
67,"So here goes. I've been on 12 weeks 'stress' leave. I use the quotation marks because it was mental health related but not just stress. I've got a psychological disorder that has been relatively manageable for most of my adult life but became kinda craptastic the last few months due to me trying to ignore all the stressors in my life.

I have 12 weeks sick leave racked up (yay Australian leave laws!) so there's no issue with money etc. and I've seen my GP (General Practitioner), Psychologist and Psychiatrist multiple times in all of this, and had a brief stint in psych triage at the local hospital. Been through some med changes and all sorts of fun stuff like that and it took a while to find the right combination sadly.

It's been an interesting journey. I was due to go back to work last week but my manager contacted me the morning of me heading back to work and asked if I was really OK to go back and I was fairly blasé, and he wanted me to make sure I was OK to come back, including requesting a note from a medical professional to say I was really OK to come back. This wasn't out of anything other than concern I'd come back and wouldn't be ready (this happened before in the same role, sadly). He also said my role wasn't at risk, the team is going well, and everyone is looking forward to me rejoining the team.

It was honestly nice to hear, and I wasn't expecting it. I've been open about my mental illness with some of my work colleagues, some more-so than others, but still not shying away. I'm scared to go back in-case it becomes overwhelming again (and other life factors) but just wanted to share a positive story about mental illness, acceptance and support. :)",28Oct2019,5

77,"My paternal grandparents are my biggest influences and closest family members. My mom and her family have zero idea that I even know them, let alone that I now ave their last name. They will find out in a few months, though.

TLDR: I have had a secret relationship with my father's parents for over ten years. No one in my family knows.

\*

First: A few years ago, my then-girlfriend/now-fiance wanted me to watch Gilmore Girls with her, which was her favorite show. I had no interest in doing so. But by the end of the month, I had watched every episode -- some many times. It was not only because it is a really well-written, excellently performed show. It is because it mirrors my life in so many different ways.

Second: Watching Gilmore Girls made me tell the following story to my fiance. She is the only person who knows this story, aside from my grandparents. I want to write it out to get comfortable with what might happen. Our wedding is in April. The rest of my family is about to find out about my relationship with my grandparents, how I officially changed my last name a few years ago to take there's, and more. This is going to hurt many people in my family. But I made a choice many years ago for this relationship to happen, and it more than anything else made me who I am today.

\*

I'm 27. My fiance and I live in Philadelphia. I grew up in one of the blue collar suburbs right next to the city. (If you are from the Philly area you can probably guess what one.) My mom also grew up there. Her parents spent almost all of their lives there, too. Nearly all of my mom's siblings lived in the same town. So did most of my cousins.

My mom had me when she was 21. My father was 24. They were only together for a few months before she got pregnant. They eventually married a few years later. My father, though, died in a car accident when I was four. I don't remember him at all. And my mom had me use her last name.

I have a very complicated relationship with my mom. She is a really nice woman. She has a great sense of humor and is truly hilarious. But... she's a mess. She had it really tough being a single mom and everything with my father. But she never made it easy for herself (or me). She bounced a lot between jobs, none of which were careers. I never had to worry about not having enough food. But it was really frustrating to be 13-years-old and having the responsibility of paying the bills or sitting down and explaining to my mom how interest rates with credit cards worked.

My mom also dated quite a bit. None of the guys she dated were terrible to her or to me. They were just sad sacks she met somewhere around town. She actually married this one guy when I was in middle school. They split up after about six months when she found out that he had been cheating on her since the start of their relationship.

.

My mom and her seven siblings did not have much growing up at all. They were not dust bowl farmers. But they didn't have any money at all. My granddad drove a truck dropping seafood off to different restaurants around the area. My grandmother was a substitute teacher.

I spent a lot of time with my family growing up... and I always just felt so completely out-of-place. A few of my family members hung out with the rough crowd (or were the rough crowd). A few have dealt with addiction issues. One died from an OD. Another cousin of mine is in jail after he was involved in some theft ring. I have a handful of other relatives who don’t really work, hang out in townie bars, sell petty amounts of drugs and spend a good amount of money a week on scratch-offs.

But the majority of my family are not wild or criminals or have addiction issues. I’m just not like any of them – not my cousins, not my aunts and uncles, and not my grandparents.

My grandfather is a gigantic sports nut. A large amount of his life revolves around Eagles games and listening to sports radio. He coached Little League baseball and CYO basketball (and is friends with a few NBA referees). He’s always talking about the need to be tough. To get the first punch in before someone punches you. To never come to his house crying about losing a fight.

That emboldened a bunch of my cousins to become… well, dicks. A few of my cousins were good athletes and went on to run track in college. But most of the guys just hung around in a pack of other jerk-offs bragging about fighting kids from some other high school in the area outside of a Wawa when they were down the shore. Or throwing a bottle at a homeless guy in West Philly when they went to buy alcohol in the hood. Or just shoving around kids they thought were nerds. (And some of the girls in my family were just as bad and very talented at starting and escalating situations.)

Like me and my friends.

I was always a reader. I would bring books with me everywhere I went. Any family function I went to (which was pretty much weekly), I would spend the time buried in some book while everyone else watched football or basketball. Or if we went to play rough touch or basketball, I was just the scrub who they made fun of. My cousins were also really into drinking. I think I’ve had maybe five dinks my entire life. They spent so much of their time scheming ways to get a half-keg to someone’s house and the like. I was into zero of it.

When we got older, I got more into comic books and tabletop games and RPGs. And then later on I ended up getting pretty into emo and indie and punk and would go into West Philly to see bands play in a basement every so often. I was the kid who went to the coffee house to read Camus (ugh) and would try to talk to people about philosophy (ugh ugh). My family has a really common Irish last name. A lot of my classmates had no idea that we were even related.

You might think that my grandparents appreciated me – the bookish nerdy grandson trying to navigate life with his nutty mom. But you would be wrong. They love me. But there were so many times my grandpop would ask me what I was reading. I would tell him. And that was the conversation. My grandma every so often also told me that I took myself too seriously. That I had to try harder to fit in. That I came off like I thought I was better than everyone.

\*

My dad was not from our town. He grew up in a nearby town that is one of the most expensive zip codes in the area. His parents were very wealthy. And they had grown up very wealthy. He went to one of the really expensive private college prep high schools (where his dad and his dad’s dad went). He was expected to go to an Ivy League college like his family.

Only, he really resented his parents and their wealth. He was very rebellious. He barely graduated high school. He refused to go to college. Instead, he played bass guitar in a few different alt-rock/metal bands. That’s how he met my mom.

My mom, her parents and the rest of my family who knew my dad and his parents absolutely despised them. Rich pompous assholes. They look down on us. They think we’re trash. They were aghast when my dad started dating my mom. They were furious when she got pregnant. They did not go to their wedding. They did go to his funeral, but apparently did not stay very long or communicate at all with my mom. I never met them.

\*

I always wondered what my dad’s parents were like. I mean, how could I not? I decided I had to find out at some point. Like… who were they? Why did they not want anything to do with me? Could they explain why I felt so fucking out of place with my family?

Then Friday night when I was a junior in high school, there was a big to do at my grandparents’ house. Someone got drunk. There was an argument. My mom’s latest boyfriend got kicked out for cursing at my grandmother. My mom left with him. And the non-fighting conversation revolved around my cousin, who scored 20 points in his last basketball game. It was just a total feeling of complete loneliness.

The next morning, I decided I had to see. I had to try. My mom was out. I looked them up online. They were still where my dad grew up. I took our crappy used car. And I headed out that way. It’s maybe 15 miles from where I grew up. But it is such a completely different area. There were luxury cars. Boutiques. Gourmet food shops.

I wound my way through the side streets through the woods, driving past mansions and luxury cars. I found their house and parked outside. They had a stone wall in front of their house with a front lawn that was the size of a football field. And they had a cobblestone circular driveway. That was the most shocking thing to me being a rowhome kid. We didn’t have driveways. Period.

I stayed parked outside for a while. I was so completely nervous – not just about trying to speak with them, but that some local cop was going to arrest me. But I finally made myself do it. I walked up the driveway to the front door. I rang the bell. A dog barked. A Hispanic woman opened the door. I thought I might have the wrong house but I then realized she was wearing a uniform – she was a maid. I introduced myself but she was really confused.

Then I heard rushed heels clanging on the tiled floor. It was Mrs. X. It was a Saturday afternoon but she still dressed like she was headed to a symphony. Everything was just so completely manicured. She asked how she could help like I was a salesman. But I saw her flinch a little bit.

Then a man came from downstairs. Mr. X. He looked exactly like success. White hair. Handsome features. Wireframe glasses. A golf shirt. Tan. Tall. Proper posture.

I then introduced myself to them. My first and last name. And then I paused.

“I’m your grandson.”

\*

I was crying a bit. I was staring down, shaking. I just expected for them to tell me to leave and to never talk to them again.

Instead, I was welcomed in. Mrs. X had a welcoming voice with a lot of worry. She asked if I wanted any tea. (What?) Or if I wanted anything to eat. Before I could say anything, she told the maid to get some snacks.

We sat down. After 17 years, I just showed up on their friggin’ doorstep. It was just really hard for any of us to start talking. There was small talk. How was my mom? (She was fine.) My grandparents? (They are fine.)

Finally, Mr. X asked me where I went to school. I told him – big, public, bad reputation, not like where my dad went, but I didn’t need to say any of that. He didn’t ask me about grades. Instead, he asked me what my interests were. What I liked to do.

I looked around the room we were in. There were all kinds of books. I said I loved to read. They asked me what my favorite books were. To Kill A Mockingbird. Animal Farm. A Separate Peace.

They were… impressed. Mr. X went to the shelf and grabbed a book of Orwell’s essays. He asked me if I liked to write. I did. He told me I had – HAD – to read his essay on politics and language. Mrs. X loved A Separate Peace. Did they teach that? I told her no. I saw it at a bookstore. She loved that. It should be on the curriculum instead of Catcher In The Rye, she said.

What were my favorite classes? I loved history and journalism. Mr. X immediately went to another room and came out with a gun used in the Civil War. He was a huge history buff. He belonged to this well-known private club in the Philly area that dates back to the Civil War. He managed to get a few antiques that way. My grandmother said she read three newspapers a day and a few other magazines (The Economist, The New Yorker, etc.) a week.

I felt so incredibly comfortable. I never had adults in my life who talked to me this way.

I asked about their backgrounds. Mr. X was somewhat retired. He was a CPA and also had his law degree. He was a partner at one of the big accounting firms (just like his dad) before he started out on his own as a consultant. Mrs. X was even more accomplished. She went to a small, very elite all-women’s college and graduated summa cum laude. She also went to a top tier law school. However, she stopped working full-time to raise my father. She still kept her license active, though, so she could represent different non-profits and the like pro bono if they needed any legal help.

After about two hours there was a lull in the conversation. I said I had to get going. (I really did.) They asked – insisted – I stay for dinner. But I couldn’t. Mr. X walked me to my car, and had his hand on my back.

He told me that they had a lovely time. And that they would love to have me back anytime I wanted. In fact, would next Saturday work?

\*

I was beaming all week. It felt a little like when you start to develop a crush on someone – just that elated feeling, but nervous, also. I was at my mom’s parents’ house for dinner one night. I was so scared that they somehow found out. But they didn’t.

Saturday afternoon finally came. My mom was off to work and off I went, a little bit earlier than the week before. They were very excited to see me. We made some small talk for the week. I was so happy being there. So thrilled. And that is why I have no idea why I said what came out of my mouth next.

“Why did you not want anything to do with me growing up?”

I mean, it was a good and very fair question. It was something I tried to not really think about at all that week, even though I spent a good part of my life up until that point with that in the back of my mind. But I said it and thought that I might have ruined it. That this relationship that made me so happy was now sabotaged.

They were squeamish and nervous.

“Well, we knew that you’d ask that at some point. After all, that’s why you came,” Mrs. X said. “And we are going to be incredibly honest with you.”

They first told me that they always thought about me. Every week at church, they each said a prayer about me. They lit candles on my birthday. That they had so many really hard emotions to cope with. But then they just opened up about my father.

They never understood how angry he was. They knew every kid rebelled to some degree. But they did not think he would rebel to such a large degree. They figured out maybe a little too late that the pressurized world of having to always be the best and have the most wasn’t for him. They loved that he finally found music. They only wish, though, that they told them he wasn’t going to college. Instead, they found out when their tuition check was returned in the mail and learned he had moved into a shady part of Philly with a bunch of his musician friends, which was mostly just a place to party.

They were disappointed with him, but figured they needed to give him space.

Then my mom came into their world. There had been other girls in and out of his life before that. But the first time they met my mom… they were both on drugs. (I assume high. No surprise.) They knew it wasn’t the first time my father had partaken in drugs. But it was just shocking. This was the first time he was introducing a girl to them and they both thought it was perfectly acceptable to show up in that type of condition.

They just figured this relationship was going to last for a little bit and that at some point my father would figure things out. But that’s when they found out about the pregnancy. They were upset. Their son was a wannabe musician who didn’t go to college. And now his 21-year-old girlfriend was pregnant. How would this possibly work out?

I was asked if I knew about “the dinner.” I didn’t. Both sets of my grandparents, my parents and two of my mom’s siblings decided to meet at a restaurant in the suburbs. It was a nightmare right from the beginning. It wasn’t just awkward. It was brutal. My mom’s dad had a few drinks before the dinner and had his anger out. My dad’s mom complimented my mom’s mom on her earrings, and my mom’s mom misconstrued the remark and thought she was being talked down to.

And then came time for the talk about the seriousness of the situation. How does a 24-year-old musician who has never had a real job possibly provide for a family?

“We were told that we were jerks for asking. One of you mom’s sisters talked about how she had her son at 22 and that worked out perfectly well.” (That’s one of my cousins who has spent time in jail.) My mom’s dad asked my dad’s dad why he couldn’t just give his little boy a job? “Or he could drive a truck like me, but I’m sure that’s not good enough for you.”

It was exasperating. There just wasn’t common ground. And then my dad told his parents that they were being complete snobs, and that he and my mom would be better off without them.

“It was just so… so stupid. We were so mad at him for saying that. We didn’t talk to him. And he didn’t talk to us. We weren’t invited to the wedding until a week before it was happening. We didn’t even know there was a wedding until one of our friends told us the week before. Can you imagine finding out that way? Why go? It was their day. If we went, it would just ruin whatever it was they wanted,” Mrs. X said.

Then there was a pause.

“And then the accident happened. And we realized how badly we had screwed everything up. Our son was dead. And we handled it so horribly on our end. It was the worst day of our lives,” Mr. X said.

Then he looked at me.

“I’m sorry.”

I told them that I wanted to be honest. They understood.

And I was. I told them about living with my mom, and how crazy it was. How my mom’s parents and my cousins and my aunts/uncles… how little I had in common with any of them. I told them how lonely I felt so much of the time. That I was scared I was going to feel like that the rest of my life. That I was going to die in the same neighborhood where I grew up.

And I told them that I had always wondered about my dad’s family. I had hoped they could maybe help me figure out why I felt that way. But I also needed to know why they never reached out to me.

Now I knew.

We just looked at each other for a few seconds. And then I asked them if they wanted me to go.

“No. I want you to call me Grandmom. And I want you to give me a hug.”

And that is when my Grandmom and Granddad became the most important people I’d ever meet in my life.

\*

I learned later that evening just how different their lives were than mine. After we ate, I started to clean the table.

“What do you think you’re doing,” Grandmom asked me.

Anytime we had dinner at my mom’s parents, someone was responsible for clearing the table. I always did so at my house, too. I insisted that I do so. Then I was reminded that they had a maid to handle such tasks. I must have given off a vibe like that was absolutely revolting to me.

“How many times have you said ‘I love doing dishes!’ when you were standing in front of the sink,” she asked. “Did you say you loved doing dishes or did you tell yourself that you had to do the dishes?”

Good point.

“We can afford to have someone do that work for us. We have the means to pay for a service. The people who perform those services for us willingly took the job. They are paid for their efforts. We do not feel bad one bit about using a housekeeping service. So don’t you feel bad, either,” she said.

That was incredibly hard to wrap my brain around at first – someone doing the dishes, taking care of the laundry, the cleaning, etc. It still is. But I learned a really important lesson.

It is inevitable in America that someone will have power over someone else, especially in a workplace type of situation. My grandparents had wealth and status. The women assigned to work at their house by the service that employed them had essentially nothing. All of them came from another country – Mexico, Central America, a Caribbean country, a former Soviet country – and did so within the past year, with limited skills in English.

My grandparents always took the time, as best as they could, to learn at least a little something about the staff. They were interested in learning where they came from and their history. And when their time at the house ended (usually after two weeks someone else was rotated in), my grandparents left a good tip, a big thank you card, and, if the woman had kids, some toys and clothes. They never raised their voice at anyone if something wasn’t done correctly. Chances were, it was because of the language barrier. Why put someone down for not understanding?

I saw first-hand the importance of always treating people with dignity and respect. And one of my Grandmom’s biggest thrills was when the agency would inform her that everyone wanted to be assigned to their house more than anyone else because of their reputation for niceness.

\*

Despite being a bookworm, I had middling grades. I was in mostly honors classes at a big public high school without a good reputation. School came really easy to me as a kid. I didn’t have to study. And then high school came, and I had to do more work, and I didn’t know how. It is also really easy to put off geometry homework if your mom skipped parent-teacher night every single year.

Grandmom and Granddad just assumed I had really good grades. Ha ha ha. The previous week they asked to see my report card, thinking it would be a point of pride. I thought about just ignoring the request but I knew I could be honest with them. So I showed it to them. I expected them to be disappointed. Ashamed. Angry.

Nope. Grandmom immediately diagnosed the situation. ""You have no idea how to study."" She brought me to their study and a clear table. She showed me how to outline an assignment like she would have done in law school. She gave me some good study tips (go in with a plan as to what you want to learn, start with the assignment you want to do the least first, have a set schedule, etc.). I never had any sort of guide like that at all.

They also contacted a private SAT tutor immediately. I had no idea that you could even get a private SAT tutor. I had studied for them a bit on my own via a book I bought but I was so far behind.

It became easy for me to spend time there. My mom was working as a waitress/caterer and picked up a lot of Friday and weekend shifts. Her boyfriend was a co-worker, so she'd usually head to his place after work. I didn't have anywhere to be until Sunday dinner at my other grandparent's house. I'd just lie (if my mom asked) about staying over a friend's house. Having those a few hours to study -- with people there to help keep me on task and could answer questions and etc. -- helped my grades immediately. It was harder to keep everything focused at my mom's, but I did my absolute best to stay on a schedule. I also did a few hundred points better on the SATs that I did on the PSATs (that I did not study for at all). 

I wanted to go to college my whole life. But I just thought my options were so limited -- some because of my finances, but mostly because of my situation. On my list were two state colleges near my house and a few Catholic universities in the area that accepted everyone.  But my grandparents and my guidance counselor at high school told me that I could apply for some higher tier schools.  They also helped me with the FAFSA (I had no clue what the f that was) and scholarship applications. I ended up getting some money on top of the Pell grant and all of a sudden I had some choices with affordability. 

I did just that. I didn't want to leave Philly. I didn't apply to Penn (way out of my reach). I won't say what school (please don't guess but you might figure it out), but I ended up accepted at a well-known Catholic university in the suburbs known for having a pretty wealthy student body.  The campus was also just down the street from my grandparents lived, which was a major factor. 

But wow. My whole life really changed because of my grandparents. And not just because of how awesome they are. But if you have means in this country, you have such huge advantages. My high school was gigantic and my guidance counselor probably had hundreds of kids she was responsible for. There's no way she could spend more than five minutes thinking about how to help me. But they had money and institutional knowledge of how it all worked. They didn't come close to doing anything like a college bribery scam. But just knowing what the hell was on those forms and what I needed to know to fill them out was such a big step.

I really understand inequality. I was so lucky to have my grandparents. That stuff was way over my head. I had some disadvantages but there are so many people in way worse situations than I was. It must feel impossible to get out of systemic poverty. I also feel pretty guilty because I know how hard it is but I haven't put in any time to volunteer or tutor or anything to help kids who could use it. It's my early New Year's Resolution to start doing that. 

\*

I don't want to make it seem like I just spent every hour from Friday until Sunday at their house. I still had a social life with my friends. I just didn't tell any of them about what was going on. I kept my family drama private from my friends well before I reached out to my grandparents. I probably should not have in retrospect. 

I was meeting up with a few friends to go to the movies one Saturday afternoon. But my car wouldn't start. My granddad offered to drop me off. But on our way over, we realized he'd have to drop me off on the other end of the parking lot and I'd have to walk. 

This way, none of my friends would see me getting out of a Jaguar with a white-haired older man they did not know. There would be too many questions.  
\*

I moved into my dorm my freshman year. My family gave me crap for the college I was going to (too uppity, even though they were fans of their athletic teams). There was also no one from my high school (or at least no one I knew) who went to this college. There were a few kids from my town who went to Catholic high school, but I didn't know any of them all that well and, plus, they probably fought my cousins at some party at some point in time.

My roommate was really wild. We're still friends to this day but there was zero way I could live with him. I really knew how much discipline I needed to do well in my classes. He was a total party kid from New Jersey. He was (and is) hilarious but I just could not deal with him coming back to the room drunk after some party. Or coming back from the library and seeing the sock on the door also got tiring. I made friends with a bunch of other people on campus, but I just didn't feel like I could deal with a roommate, which makes sense being an only child. 

Since I was only about 20 minutes (at most) from their house, I could just go to my grandparents house whenever I wanted. They gave me a key. I'd usually go for dinner. But then I'd spend my time there studying. And soon I started sleeping over during weekdays.

Finally, I had an idea. I was there all of the time. I'd save a lot of money for housing. They lived by campus so I would not really miss much of student life. I didn't really like going to parties (being a non-drinker) and, if I did, I wouldn't have to worry about driving home drunk. 

I was nervous but I asked one night at dinner if I could move in with them full-time. I thought they might say no -- it's their house and they could use privacy and they were always encouraging me to be active at school.

""We were going to ask you if you wanted to do that tonight,"" Granddad said. So I moved in that weekend. If I didn't live with them, I'm not sure I would have graduated Dean's List.

\*

By this time, I had my own used car. It wasn't much better than my mom's, but it served the need of getting me to wherever I needed to go. It was really start to park a 1996 Saturn in the campus parking lot while I'd see a classmate get out of a new SUV or something else like that. 

My car was at the garage one day. Granddad said I could borrow his car. He had a Benz again so I drove that and parked. A few of my friends saw me get out of the Benz and were completely shocked. Like... none of my friends who came from money even had a car like that. I did not even bother to explain.

For Christmas that year, my grandparents said they wanted to buy me a car. I was not going to turn that down. Our first dealership was a BMW. I was completely shocked. But then I reminded them that I had a whole other family.

That's when my grandparents realized that I had not told my mom or anyone on that side about our relationship. I lied about that. They were really mad at me. It was the first time they were ever that upset with me, and they expressed so right in the lobby of a luxury car dealership. 

I don't think they understood the animosity my mom and her family had towards them. They didn't know them at all, aside from a few times meeting my barely adult mother and one time with everyone else. Their view of everything that happened with my dad was the worst event to ever happen in their lives. But they did not realize the anger they had, let along still had.

I told them that I'd have to tell them when I was ready. And I was not sure I would ever be ready. I'm still not ready. But they will find out in a few weeks once the wedding invitations come.

They ended up buying me a new Honda.

\*

There were definitely some awkward and funny moments when I was able to have some of the trappings of their money when I borrowed their car or was forced to relinquish household chores to a housekeeper. Living with them full-time definitely made slowly made me feel like I was now more part of not just their lives but their world. I didn't have to do laundry. They had a heated outdoor swimming pool. I went on vacation with them over part of my winter break to their condo in Florida with a view of the Gulf. I especially felt it meeting their friends and colleagues at dinner parties they held or a few functions I attended with them. There's no way I would have ever shaken hands with their Republican congressman, let alone be able to speak with him personally for 10 minutes about his higher education policies.  

Like I said earlier -- being wealthy in America means you will have power in so many situations. There's a difference, though, from having someone buy you a car and never having to make the bed to feeling you actually had some level of power over another person. 

The first time I felt it came at a brunch I went to at the country club they belonged to. It was my junior year of college. I had gone to the club a few times with Granddad to take a few golf lessons and play a few rounds with him. But I wasn't the biggest fan (which disappointed him). But I had never been with them for a meal or the sort.

At brunch, I recognized one of the waitstaff. It was a kid I went to high school with who was friends with some of my cousins. This kid was a major, major, major asshole to me. He bullied me more than a few times (he was a lot bigger than me).  When he saw me at the table, he clearly recognized me. I was nervous at first that he'd stooge off to my family. But then I quickly realized that I had a degree of authority over him. It was such a rush.

I asked him so smugly how he was doing and what he had been up to. He was ""taking a break"" from the local community college. Before he could ask me anything, I ordered him to bring me a cup of coffee and, no, I did not need any room for cream or sugar. I had never talked to anyone like that before, let alone in front of my grandparents.

I felt my Grandmom look at me. I thought she was going to be mad.

""I take it that you two were not exactly friends?""

I said no.

""Well, you know how I feel about treating people who work in the service industry."" 

He came back with my coffee. 

""Young man, I clearly instructed you that I did not want my Bloody Mary this spicy. Please bring it back to the bar and have a new one made for me."" Grandad leaned back in his chair and chuckled just loud enough for him to hear it.

Grandmom smiled at me. ""I belt that felt good. Don't act like that ever again.""

I haven't.

\*

Holidays and other landmark occasions became easy for me to navigate. I just learned to say equivalents to the word ""no"" a lot more once I had some freedom. For instance, my mom's brother had a big birthday party. A few weeks earlier at Sunday dinner, he began roughly every sentence with the phrase ""I'm not racist, but..."" while his son would tell jokes with judicious use of the n-word. (BTW, his son is now a cop.)

So, when my mom gave me the information about the details of the party, I just said I was not going. She was shocked. I told her I had too much schoolwork. I heard about how I needed to make time for family. And I told her that I didn't. 

There's no real answer to that.

My birthday was easy enough. It usually fell on some random weekday in February. I could celebrate with my friends and grandparents the day it actually occurred. And then I could head to my mom's and her parents' on the weekend. Christmas was a bit tricky. But, usually, I would head to my mom's on Christmas Eve, sleep there, do the usual family event with her and then say I had to rush back to my apartment (I claimed to live in one after freshman year) to check on the heat or a neighbor's cat or etc. I have still used these sorts of excuses (having a fiance now makes the excuses easier) after college ended. 

But I do have one regret over one big event: My college graduation. My mom and her parents really wanted to go. I informed them of how long the ceremony is and it was also outside and hot. (These were not lies.) That kept them away. But Grandmom and Granddad attended, and their pictures of me in my cap-and-gown are all over their house. That would have been a good time to explain. 

I did have a family dinner with my mom, her parents and a bunch of other family a week later. That was a really weird situation. It was mostly the usual -- me trapped in a small house with people I did not like, having conversations I did not want to be a part of. But then my mom's mom started to talk about how proud she was. How proud everyone was of me. A college graduate. From XXX of all colleges. Dean's List! You were always such a smart boy. The pride of the family. We knew you'd be successful. You were always so creative.

I wanted to scream. I wanted to tell them all to go screw off. My whole life these people treated me like crap! My grandparents had no interest in me at all. Or they (correctly) told me I thought I was better than them. And now here I was being lauded. Why the fuck were they celebrating me?

I went back to my mom's that night and crashed in what was my childhood bedroom and cried. I was not wrong about how I felt about them. But maybe they just didn't know what to do with me. I wasn't like everyone else. I wasn't like them. And maybe they knew I didn't need them to the same degree they needed each other.

My parents had their 50th wedding anniversary. I wanted to get them something that showed how much I appreciated them. I always had this idea in the back of my mind. I decided to go through with it.  It took some time and dealing with going to the county courthouse. But I filled out a form to legally take their last name. 

My biggest worry with it was that I had to have my request for name change published as a legal ad. It would have been my luck for Grandmom to see the ad. Or I was also worried that one of my mom's family members might somehow stumble on it (even though it is not Fox News). 

Eventually, a court date was set. The judge asked me a few questions. I answered them politely. He signed a decree. I went to motor vehicles and had my license changed. I then got the decree framed and wrapped.

I gave it to them on their anniversary right before they left for a few weeks to Europe.

They couldn't believe it. We all cried. But it really felt right. They're my biggest influences and made me the person I am today.

\*

Life moved on. I got a job. I moved out of my grandparents place and into the city with friends from college. They also helped me a ton with getting started. They paid my student loans off for me and also gave me some more money on top of that to help me get started. Plus, my first job was through a connection my Grandmom's friend made for me.

I still went to their house almost every weekend. I went on a few vacations with them. I was hospitalized for a few days with a stomach issue. They were the ones who were my emergency contacts and came to visit. It also was a lot easier to drift away from my mom's side again. A few of my cousins moved away. A few got married or had kids. I could pick and choose my spots in terms of events to attend.

But the most important moment I shared with my grandparents was at a function at their house to celebrate Granddad's work anniversary. It was largely stuffy, with his colleagues and friends. Someone he worked with for years brought with him his daughter, who was working for his insurance brokerage. She was the only other person there roughly my age, which explains why someone as beautiful as her would talk to me to start with. We talked for a few hours. I asked her to get dinner the next day. 

And then two weeks later, she made me watch Gilmore Girls with her. She's the first person I ever told any of this to. (And she wants me to write this all down.) She also has a pretty wild family background. Her parents divorced and it was very nasty and bitter.  Her dad also almost lost his business in the recession. I knew from starting to watch that show together we'd be married.

Earlier this year, we had dinner with her dad and my grandparents at their house. They weren't just the first people I told  got engaged. I proposed to my fiance in front of them. 

My fiance has met my mom. They like each other but are not going to ever go to dinner together one-on-one. My mom's dad is in bad health, so communicating with him is hard. My mom's mom also seems to like her but it's the same. She, like me, does not like most of my  uncles/aunts/cousins. I have become a bit closer with my one cousin Katie, especially because she's now a single mom and her daughter is sort of taking my place as the family oddball.

I have no idea how they will react. We're at a crossroads because we have to send out save the date cards soon, and they're going to have my last name on them. We're thinking of having a big dinner and hopefully it won't hurt too many people.",28Oct2019,1

Well after all the years, my mother finally snapped and told him shes gonna divorce him if he doesnt stop drinking by the time I move out (which is planned next year in August). He probably doesnt remember her telling him that, because hes always shitfaced. Worst part is that he drives drunk with the whole family in the car. He has tried quitting multiple times but just kept ending up going back to the bottle. We have tried EVERYTHING.. rehab, medication for quitting by himself, dumping his bottles.. I dont know what to do. I can only hope that he will stop drinking because if he doesnt he will be alone for the rest of his life. He would probably end up killing himself if my mom left him.

83,"Context:
I'm a (20M) and recently had a nightmare that I can't seem to forget. I don't typically remember my dreams and only seem to remember maybe one or two a month. 

This will make sense in a moment but I was an exchange student from the US to Germany in 2015-2016. Disclaimer when I was dreaming I was sure the dream was reality, I'm never consciously aware I'm dreaming. 

The Dream:
My dream started with me being 16 again and going on my foreign exchange both excited and nervous, however instead of going to Germany I was going to the middle east. I'm not sure which country it was exactly but I remember being slightly nervous for my safety but I was also sure the media had made the level of danger exaggerated. 

I was in high school in another foreign country again, I'm really shy so I struggled to make friends until I found guys who also had similar interests as me, things were looking optimistic as I learned the language and culture. Well one day leaving class my new friends began to yell and run in terror, I looked up to see a US drone flying overhead. 

Everyone was screaming and running in panic, I remember thinking it wouldn't hit a school. An explosion hit the ground next to my friend with such force it threw him off his feet. That's when the fear set in, I began to run for my life fearing that at any moment I would feel the immense force hit my chest and lights out. 

Before the dream ending the last thing I remember was thinking I would become a casualty of my own country's ordinance. How my death might be used as a piece in my nation's political chess board. The dream ending with me running in fear as loud and powerful ordinance hit the ground, panic so loud it was drowning. 

Aftermath:
Normally when I have a dream and it's a powerful one I can remember it for either a couple minutes to an hour, a whole day if it really stuck out. It has been three days and I can remember every detail perfectly, it haunts me. I do follow politics and I am in the process of joining the US Army. Even though it was a dream, I will never see drones the same way again.",28Oct2019,1
84,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

Today I made the decision to end my life.

I am done. I give up. My hands are in the air. I throw in the towel.

My life is miserable.

First I thoight 2017 was the worst year of my life. Then 2018 came and topped that. And now 2019 crashed and burnt me.

I don't want to go on anymore. It's no fun being alive.

My birthday is in one month. I plan on making a spectacle out of it. With the few friends I have left. I'll throw a big party. I'll get shit faced. I'll celebrate what's left of this miserable excuse of a life. And then the next day I'll finally do what I should've done a long time ago. What I tried but never succeeded in.

This is not a sad post. I am finally content. I accept that this life is not meant for me. I accept that I am not strong enough to endure all the hardships my life decides to throw at me. I am just done and I wanted to get it off my chest.

I was never meant to be. I finally realize that. And it feels liberating.

Good riddance. I won't miss any of it.",28Oct2019,34
85,"Hey everyone,

I'm working on a social group platform, designed to help users discover people who have similar interests and experiences, and to see what's going on around you. This way they can meet up in real life and coordinate social interactions. You can think of it as similar Meetup but free, more secure, wide demographic, and many other features. It will be free to use, unlike Meetup.

Features a live map with events and people, a securely encrypted chat, and a discovery feed to meet new people.

For instance, let's say you moved to a new city for work, you don't know anyone there, and are looking to meet people and find fun things to do. You fire up the app and connect with people who have interests in common, and events curated to you.

Or, let's say you want to find something to do tonight, you open the app and see what events are happening -- curated to your specific interests. You can also post your own events and have people join you.

This is perfect for a sub like this, where the whole point is to be more social. The purpose of the app is **to create a great social environment through meaningful real-life interactions**.

Frequently Asked Questions:

*What is this?*  
Locus is an affinity group platform centered around the idea of building a community through the connection of users that share similar interests/experiences. It allows users to form groups, and create/discover events that they are interested in.

*What makes it better than apps like Meetup?*  
In terms of cost, the platform will be **free** to use. Locus will reach a broad audience with free user-event creation and an engaging interface, unlike Meetup.com. We intend to maintain user-friendly privacy practices and promote a policy of not selling user data and be a platform that users can rely on. Messaging uses strong end-to-end encryption, and the company will follow user-friendly privacy protection policy. It does not sell your data as a monetization method.

*What about meeting up with people from online? How do you ensure safety?*  
Great question. Based on our research we know that a lot of people might feel anxious or worried about meeting people online. We are implementing Identity Verification to increase the overall safety of users. Several methods will be used, such as: e-mail/phone confirmation, social media connection, integration of identity verification API, and more. This will ensure that users have a verified profile, so that the platform is safe to use. This is something that we are placing a focus on. That way you know that someone is who they say they are.",28Oct2019,11

88,"It's my first year at a new school, and I hate everyone. I sit alone at lunch every day because I can't stand everyone talking about volleyball and their gossip.   All of my opinions here are unpopular, so people get angry if I tell them. For example, I say I don't like this font, Times New Roman is more professional. I also get into many heated debates. When someone says Febuary, I correct them to February which is correct to traditional English, but people still disagree w/ me. I have always been selective w/ friends because I never fit in. At my last school, I made only one friend. At this school, I have nothing in common with anyone, and I won't change my values to make friends. Last year I was a class clown, now everyone despises me. Everyone has Instagram humor. My parents tell me to be open-minded to make friends. The problem is I don't want to be friends with anyone here. I like people that I can joke with, and talk about fashion with. Everyone makes fun of me when I talk about fashion, or when I say something about the runway they talk about how tires have also been seen on the runway.  My parents also force me into horrible social situations. I wish they could understand that I'm not going to have friends.

89,"Growing up people tell you that you have to take certain steps to be successful. So when i came to the conclusion that i want to live in a van, travel the us (maybe the world), and just do things that i want to do. Well, to say my family is unsupportive would be a gross understatement. I want to have a very minimalist lifestyle and live on my own terms. At the moment (saving for the van right now), i plan on going to diving school once i get this adventure up and going. I cant wait. And the funny part is, i cant even swim lol. (23m). And if i decide diving isnt for me, ill go find something that is. My brother seems to think ill completely fail and in 10 years(ish) ill have no money and be homeless. Yet if on the offchance i find my calling, he wants a share of the success. My mother just seemed to nod it off, now shes telling me shes supportive. (doesnt feel like it though).

All i know is, i dont want to be tied down somewhere because im paying off debt for a degree that everybody said i should go for, instead of listening to myself and doing what i want to do. My mother works at a factory, my step father doesnt work, my brother works at a tech store, and i deliver pizza. None of these jobs sound remotely like something i want to be doing for 20 years, yet i see my mom putting in another 20, and my brother putting in at least 30. 

It kills me that people waste all this potential to work at a job they do not like and complain about constantly, then make no effort to change it. Lifes amazing and if you're going to spend all this time, you might as well explore your passions, right? I feel my family just doesn't understand and instead they've accepted a life of mediocrity and comfortability. Every time i bring up something i want to do, or bring up some idea, or even just listen to them, the default goto is ""what can go wrong"". Not ""what can go right"".

The only thing about resin enamel is that it breaks easily, and when you have lost 50% of the surface, the break happens right at the center of the tooth. I've broken them 11 separate times.

The only long-term solution is to get porcelain veneers, which insurance deems an exclusively cosmetic procedure. They are insanely expensive. But i miss eating normal food.

Doesn’t ask me how my day was, despite the fact that he loves to bring up my recent suicide attempt as evidence that I don’t love him enough. (Haha, right.)

I decided that today is not the day where I try to make him feel better, so I said ok and went to my room rather than cheer him up. What does he do? He comes into my room and tells me how he doesn’t even know why he lives here since I obviously don’t care about him. I make some vague noises of sympathy. I’ve had a twelve-hour day. I don’t bother him when he comes home from work, so why do I have to cheer him up when I come home? He doesn’t do the same for me. Whenever I get down I just get screamed at and told to get over it. If I ever said that to him he’d try to kick me out. 

He ended up getting angry again and tells me he’s going to take a shower and go out. Ok. Not my problem. You do you. I’m not going to be guilt tripped anymore. You’re in a bad mood? Doesn’t mean I need to be dragged down with you as you berate me and tell me how awful I am.

I dont care that most likely gonna make a concept, have it rock the world, then i dont make the money and my company dies, so what? At least I would have TRIED. 

Seriously fuck anyone that doubts me, give it 50 years at most and you're gonna see my cars in music, movies, tv, games, in celebrities garages, and slaying on the track, just wait and see. Im gonna beat everyone in every way imaginable. Ill make more beautiful cars than pagani, faster cars than koenigsegg and bugatti, more luxurious cars than maybach, better tourers than ferrari and aston martin.

111,"I am currently unemployed for the first time ever since i graduated high school 2 years ago. Working shitty minimum wage jobs have really added onto my really bad anxiety and depression. The only thing I know at this point is that I would really hate to end up staying at a job that I absolutely hate. I have been unemployed now for 2 months and I have had money saved up so i've been fine financially for the most part. I am living with my parents currently attending community college and I soon have to transfer. My major is physics which I don't want do at all. I have struggled finding a major that is right for me. I sometimes feel as if school isn't really for me and I should just drop out and begin working a full time job. Much like the types of jobs that I have been working for the passed two years. I am just afraid of not being able to find the right career path through school and just get stuck working jobs that don't pay well and that I hate. 

The only thing I would really love to hear is how you guys have all ""carved your own path"" by chasing something you were truly passionate about or something you enjoyed for the most part. Thank you.",28Oct2019,4
112,"About 10 years ago I learned that one of my childhood friends had told a couple of people from our neighborhood that he had sex with me. We did not have sex, not even close, but he did tell that story to individuals, and even went as far as describing what color panties he decided I was wearing on that alleged night. I was pissed! I kept trying to explain myself to my cousin, and my neighbors for maybe three or four years that me and this individual never had any kind of relations whatsoever.

Well I just got a phone call from my cousin saying: “ so guess what happened? Jordan and I were sitting in my car talking, and he confessed that he never had sex with you, I’m sorry that I didn’t believe you blah blah blah blah... well I guess he got what he deserved because he got into a car accident and now he’s paralyzed from the chest down.” 

😳😳😳😳😳

... Now I won’t say that I think that he got what he deserved because I don’t think that a simple rumor warrants paralysis, but I will say that karma works in quite the mysterious fashion.

Moral of the story: STOP LYING TO LOOK “cool”",28Oct2019,3
113,Im only attracted to girls that are very beautiful (the typical model look). I know I already sound like an asshole but I don’t want to be like that.  I’m usually not superficial and looks don’t play a role for how I treat someone. I always hated it when the „odd“ looking kid got bullied. But when it comes to attraction for girls I can’t just put the switch off. She has to be very beautiful or I’m not attracted. That’s actually why I never had a girlfriend. There are so many awesome girls with amazing characters out there but I’m just too superficial to date anyone...,28Oct2019,0
114,"The last couple of days have been a mess for me. I had the worst panic attack I have had in years, but despite that I feel like I am improving. 

After 5 years of feeling like I have not been the one in control is it indescribably liberating to feel so confident in myself again. After a few weeks of therapy I am *finally* starting to get more involved with things that are happening around me and I derive joy and pleasure from them as well. But at the same time my anxiety has hit new heights daily and it drains me of energy. Constant battles of feelings of inferiority and panic on top of my reduced hunger is tiering. But it is all worth it in the end and I am not giving up until I can finally enjoy life to the fullest again.",28Oct2019,4
115,"It's just that even if I magically got over depression, ptsd, panic disorder, anxiety, and psychosis my life would still be fucked up beyond repair. I'm tens and tens of thousands in debt and I'm only 22. It's been this way since I dropped out of college and then went to the hospital for a past suicide attempt. So now I have absolutely crushing debt from student loans, medical costs from the hospital, along with credit card debt because I'm an impulsive irresponsible idiot. My credit is sub-400 because so much of this has gone into collections and I haven't been able to keep up with payments. I eat on like $1 a day, have a cheap phone plan, a shitty car that needs so many repairs it could die at any second, live with abusive alcoholic parents because It's at least rent-free even though the abuse is intolerable, and work as much overtime as I can at the job I hate on top of giving plasma twice a week and it still isn't enough. By the time I make even 3/4 of my payments I have and pay for food and gas to get to work and back I have basically no money for anything including saving. That's working as much as I can and giving plasma and not a penny into savings and it still isn't enough, and other things just become more and more delinquent in collections so my credit only gets worse and worse.  Some of these things I'm only even making interest payments so I'm literally making no progress whatsoever on the actual debt. 

I can't move out of my abusive, disgusting house (pet waste, pests and mold *everywhere*) with parents who are drunk 7 days a week 52 weeks a year. Even working my absolute hardest at a job that I hate but the pay is ok and I can work overtime and plasma isn't enough. I can do literally nothing. 

Even if I weren't depressed this would be a horrible horrible existence and that's the thing people don't get. It's not even about the mental illness anymore. Yes I'm taking meds and seeing a therapist and psychiatrist and have for 7 years but none of it has ever done a thing. I've done the works, every lifestyle change and med and therapist and group and therapy type and everything short of ECT or ketamine because I can't afford them and none of it has ever done a thing. 

But! Even if it did, even if i was mentally healthy, my life would be absolutely awful. I can't live like this. I don't think anyone should. If someone described this life to me even if they didn't have a diagnosed mental illness I'd understand if they didn't wanna live. This isn't unreasonable or crazy. It isn't ""just money."" Money *does*  buy happiness for some people and I'm one. I could move out from my horrible house, not work the shit job I hate and focus on doing things I enjoy and that heal me, I could afford more treatment options, I could travel, try to get back on track to going to college again, I could visit the couple friends I have who live far away etc. It all comes down to money. That's it. My happiness is dependent on money and I can't get it and won't get it. This is realistically the best paying job i'll get right now and I'm working OT and supplementing my income and it can't even touch my needs. 

Just cruel. It's funny in the darkest way. Money is so arbitrary and it's what I'm gonna kill myself over. A social construct is gonna kill me. And if I had just had a better dice roll at birth I'd be completely fine. If I had just been born to rich parents like so many are I wouldn't have to die and could live a fulfilling life, but the way my life actually is I can't. It's impossible, I've tried everything. I've even very very seriously considered escaping my debt by moving to another country but it would be way too expensive upfront, even just a one-way plane ticket would be way too much. They say suicide is a last resort but it's like yeah obviously. Nobody stubs their toe or gets a hangnail and suddenly kills themselves over it with nothing else going on. I am using it as a last resort. I've tried literally everything else. Everything I can try, I tried and it didn't work. So this is all that's left.",28Oct2019,2

117,I’ve been constipated for a while so I tried to go and felt a jab of pain in my ass. Seems like I got an anal fissure. So then I go and get all sorts of stuff to unclog me. But I fucked up and went too far. I had diarrhea for a day or two. But now my ass hurts so fucking bad. There’s blood and when I push it feels like needles in my ass. I need to shit or I’m going to get constipated again. But it hurts SO FUCKING BAD. FML,28Oct2019,2
118,"I still can’t believe he did it. 

I’m so upset. 


My mom and have been married for 24 years. 1.5 years ago my mom told my dad she wasn’t happy...

Yeah, you guessed it. She started seeing somebody...

Before my dad knew this she lied and hid this affair and told us it was just things that she wasn’t happy with and herself... her mom had died and she didn’t cope well with it or grieve properly, then we’ve had other family hardship and a hurricane flood my parents house. She’s been through a lot, on top of having an affair. 

Well my dad moved out of the house, to the lake house. My mom stayed in the house they lived in together. 

During this my dad started and quit therapy for a whopping 4 weeks. He started antidepressants at dose or .5 mg and said they didn’t work! 

My dad wasn’t trying to move on or accept my moms divorce. 

3 weeks ago we found out she’s been seeing someone. The divorce was set to be final this week, pending my mom and dads initials on a small document. 

The last 3 weeks my dad couldn’t accept all this. It’s been up and downs, he went to stay at my uncles this past weekend. He said he wanted to start being around people again. During this 3-4 months of their separation, my dad didn’t do all the things he needed to do to start becoming happy again. I did literally everything I could besides move in with him.  We talked a lot up until yesterday, I saw him a handful of times. 

It was so fucking terrible y’all. Just like a movie. We came home from lunch. My mom, my aunt, my grandpa, and me. 

My dad was stopping by to turn in his paperwork to finalize the divorce, him and my mom got into an argument before we got home. 

When we got back.... fuck... 

I ended up finding him hanging in their shed,.. he had some life to him... I freaked the fuck out.. I yelled so loud my mom and aunt came running from inside the house.. I turned and saw my mom coming and yelled at her to not come any closer. I told her to call 911, I told my aunt to go grab the neighbor. From the time I saw him to the time I told my mom to call 911 happened in about 10 seconds.. I snapped back and started calculating their phone call and the time it was, I grabbed a machete that was literally on the fucking pegwall that he built! I grabbed it and cut my fucking dad down off a god damn rope! Y’all.... the absolute worst.. I pulled him to the edge of the shed where I could get to his body, I grabbed the rope from his neck and check his pulse, I felt feint life. I started performing cpr and chest compressions...for about 5 mins... my mom is hysterical, but not by us. My aunt called my grandpa who literally just left and pulled off the rode.. I saw him leaving but couldn’t stop, as I felt I had a small chance to save my dad.. my grandpa got the call and came back. So about 5 mins into me giving my dad cpr and chest compressions my grandpa tags in and starts with me. We do this for 15 mins... 

Ems finally arrived, and yeah, well... the rest is history. My dads dead. 

He had the right to do what he did. But, my god how selfish? I’m so hurt that he was in that much pain. I’m hurt he god mad and finally had enough of feeling that way. 

Right now I’m having a hard time stopping seeing how I saw him hanging. I’m having a hard time shaking it off. 

I feel salty towards my mom, but I dont and won’t ever hate her. 

I’m so hurt for my dad, I’m so sad and mad at him. 
I feel so bad for my sisters.
