2,"It started out fun, a scammer made a fake profile of my grandma and tried to get me to click a link. They ended up calling me the asshole and blocked me before the page was taken down. Then I made the miatake of asking my husband a question when he was upset about his package being smashed to shit when it arrived. I asked him about the email the account was under, I thought it was still under mine. He projected his anger on me and when I tried to explain myself he kept telling me that I'm wrong and how dare I bring up his mistakes. 

He made the account under my email first and says he deleted it and remade it with his account but I still get emails from the company so how dare I assume he left it. I love my husband and I wouldn't say he's abusive but I very clearly bother him with my existence. If he's even kind of in a bad mood I can't say anything to him with out him getting mad that I'm bothering, pestering, bugging, nagging, or asking him repeatedly. To get him to actually get up and do anything I HAVE to nag him until he gets so mad that he does it to shut me up. I can hardly walk most days for unknown reasons. Idk my back and leg hurt terribly constantly and being alive is a chore. I'm not asking him for much- take out the trash, get the mail, hang the pictures and shelf when we moved in. I cook dinner every day, clean the house, the litter box, wash his clothes. We have been together 5 years and he's never once washed or folded a thing.  I do everything for him he wouldn't have the job he has if it wasn't for me. We wouldn't have anything just like we used to if I decided I didn't want to be a homeless fat piece of shit anymore. Still a fat piece of shit though I can't change everything.

I'm sorry I'm rambling, I'm sitting in the walmart parking lot debating if I want to go back or get on the freeway, Idk how far my car will make it, maybe I don't care. I only have my husband in this whole state, I don't have any friends really, none in my town any way. None I could talk to. It's dark and my stomach hurts because I ate pineapple even though I know I can't. I need to take my medicine, I don't even think it does anything. I don't want to be married anymore but I'll have nothing if I leave.",05Apr2019,1
3,As the title suggests I was sexually assaulted. Last night/tonight I had my first kiss after that (it was a year ago). I was slightly (ok more than slightly) intoxicated and said to a cute girl “wanna kiss” to my shock and suprise she said yes. We made out twice tonight. I have no idea what this means for “us” but part of my assault was him trying to kiss me. I’m beyond proud of myself and just wanted someone else to know about this achievement which is massive for me:),05Apr2019,17
4,"I bought this laptop in my very first term at university around four and a half years ago. It’s been through a lot, being taken backwards and forwards to various places and has been on many international flights. It’s not a high-end system (i7-3630QM, 8 GBs of RAM, Nvidia GeForce 740M), but it‘s the first laptop I’ve owned capable of running games decently well. I’m definitely excited about upgrading, but I have an emotional attachment to the little guy.

The sad part is, it hasn’t even really slowed down (although I don’t think it’s running quite as efficiently as it was when it was new). No, the thing it’s dying from is on the outside. My baby is literally falling apart in my arms. A while ago, I noticed the casing going around the hinge on one side. This problem spread across both hinges and I’ve tried to be as gentle with it as I can. Then, last night, I closed my buddy up for the day, something snapped and it closed at an angle (as in the screen half didn’t line up with the body half). I’ve never seen it happen before, and my heart just sank. I moved it to my desk and tentatively opened it again, wincing with each noise it made. I’ve elected to leave it open on my desk as I feel it may be at a point where opening and closing it causes further damage each time. I’m praying for it to last just a few more months, but its days are numbered. Thanks for the memories, old pal. I’ll try and make the last stretch of your life as painless as possible.",05Apr2019,1
5,"Im 25 now but since turning 22 I've been feeling that my best years are over because I won't be considered ""young"" for much longer, I don't like to think of myself as being old and knowing that the time of being youthful is drawing to a close is quite disconcerting .

I am doing horrible in school. I haven't been back there for a while, and anytime I am there I get horribly anxious. I have no friends. I don't trust my parents, they've proven that I can't rely on them many times now.

The way I see it right now, I've probably got three choices. Stay here and probably end up living with my parents all my life, kill myself, or runaway and try and figure things out myself.

The way things are going, I'll probably kill myself. I guess I'm asking or advice. What should I do? People keep telling me to keep going. But it's not going to work, and nobody understands that.",05Apr2019,1

10,"The charms of being an international student in college (and just a college student in general) include those of meeting new people, and not just in travel but also in your classes, your dorm, and around campus. With the semester coming to a close, I think of the people I've met this year as a freshman. So many amazing people, from every possible place in the world, so many stories I didn't get to hear. 

I think of the ways in which some of the seniors in my classes are ending this journey as I have just begun it, and that these wise souls I will not get to see again, and with them go many stories I didn't get to hear because I didn't get friendly with any of them.

Then again, I think of people such as my roommate, who I will not be rooming with again since we are very different people, but that we've also had a unique experience living together as complete strangers to how we are now, friendly. 

Some of my professors as well, people with a passion for divulging what they know best, some truly lovely people themselves, who I will not bump into in the next few years.

All this just reminds me of the word sonder. In the truest sense of the word, we are just extras in each other's lives. ",05Apr2019,1

13,"I got out of a really bad place two years ago and changed my life. Since then I feel like I’ve been doing good but not improving much. I’d like to change that. I want to be nicer (I’m grumpy and VERY easily aggravated) and I want to learn to be as strong as I can be.

I try to avoid negativity at all costs. When I acknowledge it, sometimes it sucks me in, so I do my best to stay away. My boyfriend is negative. He’s an incredible boyfriend, but he’s very very hard on himself. He tells me things like “I’m just here to work, pay bills and die. That’s it.” It worries me and hurts me a lot. Sometimes I feel like it might hold me back. How can I help him? Is it possible for me to live with him hating himself?

15,"I had an accident 5-6 years ago. I was in high school at the time, and I was talking to a few friends of mine. There’s an area where people can play mild version of ‘sports’ but they chose to do it at an area meant for just relaxing and sitting. I was talking, and the last thing I saw was them running into me. I had 2 two people land on top of me. I almost died. I blacked out and it resulted in not letting anyone know about what happened. It was to a point where I had to get wheeled chaired out, for I got stuck in a school desk. Now my leg is fucked up from the accident, I can’t sleep, walk or do much properly like a normal person. It’s to late to file anything. I’ve been suffering with this for years, I want to give up and cry. I feel like an inconvenience and a bother. There’s times where I want to just end it all so I don’t even cause any problems. I’m tired, constantly in pain. I’m only 20(f). Had this for 5 years. Please, if you get into an accident, report it.

18,"I recently bought myself a subscription to the university gym for an incredibly decent price for the year. My goal for the end of the year is to actually get fit and not be the skinny kid I currently am - but I don’t know what I’m doing.
I try my best to research the kinds of things I should br doing to exercise muscle groups but there’s so much stuff, and the fitness subreddits really don’t like it if you do ask: I don’t have enough money to hire a personal trainer.
I go to the gym for an hour whenever I can (at least four times a week) and I know some of the things I want to be doing, but I run around like a lost puppy looking at all the machines and using much lighter weights than everyone else there.

19,"I have my MCAT (medical college admissions test) on Saturday morning. I’ve been working my ass off for 3+ months. In the past 2 weeks, I finally hit (and actually exceeded) my goal scores on 2 different practice exams.

But for some reason, as the exam approaches, I’m losing confidence. I had so much confidence after getting those 2 scores and it seems to be emptying/draining  as it gets closer. I’m thinking of all of my weaknesses rather than all my strengths and I’m getting anxious.

I want to study a few hours tomorrow but I think it might be helpful to take the day off and just relax. I know I have what it takes, I killed the practice exams that are MADE by the company who makes the real test. It just feels like you could always know more...

21,"I’m away from home for college.  I see my mom once in 3-4 months and talk to her on the phone about twice a week. 
2 weeks ago I went through a horrible breakup and it was just before my midterms.
I was so upset, I didn’t want to talk to anybody other than my a few good friends.
When I’m feeling really sad for long periods of time I feel so alone and think of my mother. 
I wanted to call her and tell her everything but she is already working too hard and I know she will get upset and worry about me so I never tell her about my problems if they’re not that serious. My bestfriend’s mom was visiting and she found out what happened.
She talked to me for hours, kissed me and hugged me and told me everything was going to be okay. The whole time I kept tears back and it finally felt like I can talk about it. 
She didn’t have to do it but did it out of her good heart.

My friends on the other hand they do their absolute best to cheer me up everyday, taking me to places, getting me out of the house, sending me study notes so I can catch up... 

I think about their efforts to make me feel better and my heart melts. I don’t deserve it. 
I don’t know what I would do without people who actually cares about me. So grateful.

22,"I whistle back every sound I hear.

I constantly have songs I love stuck in my head, and I can remember every note to those song.

I sing whenever I'm alone and shyly hum when I'm at work. A smile comes to my face when I replay a melody in my head and notice the ""sticky"" parts. I hear guitars and try to figure out where they are playing. I hear chords on a piano and visualize the voicings. These sensations of knowledge may not be accurate, but they fill me with joy and understanding. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel lonely to know that people don't care about how great this tune is to me. Or how absorbing the harmonies. I feel alone in this happiness and it leaves me feeling bittersweet.

25,"OK so my best friend (we'll call her 'D') has in the last few years got really involved in personal development seminars and positive thinking which is great and she's really happy and really driven now.

But it just made me realise something - 

I meet her as often as we can now that we live in the same city, usually with her new friends that she's made from all these different ventures she's been on (she's also a member/rep of a travel club that focuses on personal development) and while I think they're good people I feel they push their beliefs on me.

As a result of hanging around with these people D has become a different person; not a bad person (She's the nicest person in the world) or anything but she definitely has changed. For the most part she's changed for the better, she's actually in the process of setting up her own business which is something I couldn't have ever seen her doing before she started going to these seminars.

They're all about setting goals and always striving to do better.... Get that promotion.... Live in that mansion.... Drive that fast car etc. And that's great for them but I've just never been like that. They always quote William S. Burroughs's - ""When you stop growing you start dying"" Which they use as a sort of mantra, but the opposite of 'dying' isn't growing, the opposite of 'dying' is 'living'.

So what's wrong with just 'living'? 

What's so wrong with being content?

I like my life. I like my job, I'm happy at the level I'm at, I'm happy with my current living situation, I'm just generally a happy person. People like D and her new ilk think that there must be something wrong with you if you're not always trying to better yourself but I think there must be something wrong with the people who are constantly trying to better themselves because clearly they're not happy the way they are, no matter what their current status is.


Being content does not mean you're lazy or unambitious. 

Just because you don't have 'goals' doesn't make you directionless. 

It's OK to be OK with the way your life is. ",05Apr2019,1

It was a classic he said she said and in the end the jury sided with me surprisingly.

Thank god for the justice system and the checks and balances in place to make sure as few innocent people as possible go to prison even if that means letting a few guilty ones get off every now and then.

28,"I never tell this story. It's a crazy story, but absolutely true. I won't tell it to anybody in real life. Not to Hannah, who inspired it. Not to any friends. So I'm telling it here.

I am a 22 year old geek.

Last year I was a 21 year old, glasses-wearing geek who was a senior in college with nearly a 4.0 GPA. And I'm still (blush) admittedly a virgin. I'm only about 5'7, a ""studies-while-eating Doritos"" belly on an otherwise normal frame.

I told my friend Hannah about how I like to wake up very early on some days and head to the local nature preserve before class. I'm always alone, and it's beautiful.

She told me that her and her boyfriend used to go, and sometimes, she would strip to the nude.

My eyes bulged. She giggled and said it was not sexual at all. It allowed her to be ""one with nature"".

She said ""You should try it sometime, if you ever got the balls. Literally haha"".

Yeah right. I never even take my shirt off at the beach.

Then, one Tuesday morning at 6:30 am on a bright, sunny, only slightly brisk early Spring Tuesday morning...I got the itch.

I don't EVER do anything out of character. Why not just try it out? Nobody will ever know.

I actually undressed. I took off my heavy boots and long socks. My sweater. My pants. My undershirt.

There I was, shivering (it wasn't THAT cold, just a tad chilly, but the nerves got to me) in nothing but my light blue boxers.

I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and slid them down and kicked them off into the pile.

Now, clad in only my glasses and as bare as a newborn baby, I cupped my package with my hands, and I timidly walked towards the lake, about 50 yards from where I left my clothes, and I looked up at the gorgeous view.

The trees. The mountains. The beautiful, clear, blue lake.

Without even thinking, I placed my hands at my sides.

And there I was. Martin the virgin geek.

Naked.

Buck naked, in fact.

More naked than the trees, which were ""clothed"" in leaves.

More naked than Adam in the Garden of Eden, who at least had a fig leaf.

I was exposed. Not just physically, but exposed to new excitement and beauty.

Inspired, I even walked around the entire lake, as naked as the day I was born.

My round, bare belly shaking. My white-as-a-ghost ""bubble butt"" that Hannah would also make me blush over that she said I was always ""hiding"" under my nerdy khakis jiggling behind me. And my small package (hey, it's a throwaway!) bobbing in the brisk air.

I walked around the entire lake.

The crisp breeze occasionally startling me by caressing my bare butt. The tickle of a few flowers on my belly and package as I walked. The feel of the fresh grass through my bare feet as I walked.

Standing there, basking in the view, it was then that I heard it.

""Beautiful, simply beautiful.""

It was a woman. About 43 years old. Pretty, with a slight hard-to-pinpoint foreign accent.

She had a GIGANTIC, expensive, HD camera. And directly taking photos - OF ME!!!

I stood there frozen in shock, eyes wide, mouth open, as naked as a newborn baby with my hands at my sides in the bright sunshine for about 5 full seconds.

Then in a panic, I cupped my package with my hands and I ran behind a tree as she giggled and kept snapping photos of the scenery.

I poked my head out from behind the large tree, hiding my vulnerable, naked body behind it, with the now colder breeze attacking my bald, defenseless white buttcheeks behind me.

""You can't take those pictures!""

She said ""I sure can, sweetie. We're out in a public space. Nobody forced you to go traipsing around in your birthday suit.""

I replied: ""You can't share those photos!!""

She said ""Relax, and don't be so embarrassed. I've seen many men in the nude over the years. I'm no virgin here.""

That made me blush beat red.

She said ""For ruining my carefully planned shoot, I'm going to use these photos to create a painting.""

As I spoke up, I felt my naked, white butt-cheeks jiggling as I was shaking in panic and anger.

I said: ""A painting?! Of what?"" as I clung desperately to the tree shielding my body from her gaze.

She smirked. ""A painting showcasing true bravery and vulnerability.""

I said ""I'm no model for a painting.""

She replied: ""Oh, but you are, nude boy. It's one thing for some confident, viking man to walk around here. You're not one of those types, with some big, silly penis flopping around to show off.""

I subconsciously placed a single hand over my package, even from behind the tree.

She said: ""But you. You're the true picture of vulnerability. Your lily-white skin. Your adorable chubby belly. A hint of a bosom on you, even with hard nipples in the cool air.""

She giggled. And I subconsciously used my other hand to hide my nipples like a damsel in distress.

""And your little penis exposed for the world to see. Standing fearlessly, without cover, in the open. Clothed by nothing but your smattering of body hair, and a slight, endearing pink blush across your cheeks. I'm going to paint you.""

My ""pink"" blush turning RED as I cried: ""But you can't!!""

She said ""I can, and I will. Google me."" She gave me her name.

""Your bare body will be in my gallery in a few months.""

Defeated, I said ""Well I'm going back around the lake, the least you can do is give my dignity and avert your eyes.""

She said ""I'll do no such thing. I have more photos to take. Now go run along, naked boy. Get that cute tushie running around the lake and get dressed, it's getting cold.""

As I ran around the entire lake, with absolutely no cover, feeling my bubble butt literally shaking behind me, I turned to see her unflinchingly smirking and staring at me. And even snapping a few more final photos.

A few months later, I did Google her, and sure enough, there I was.

A sight that a girl had never seen before, my naked body. It was expertly painted I must say, with unfortunately exquisite detail. A lush greenery set against beautiful mountains, with my blushing, eyes wide, mouth open, naked spectacle, arms at my sides, standing in front. My small penis and balls prominently displayed right in front.

With 2,000 favorites on her website. She displayed it in a gallery. It was sold for $5,600.

And it hangs right in the lobby of my town's city hall. Amazingly, nobody has noticed it's me. Or, they are too embarrassed to tell me...",05Apr2019,1

I want to write a book.

Hi, I’m Anthony! I have very little discipline but I want to write a book to feel smart and special :). I don’t have any real special motivation or idea to write about. I don’t think I’ve had any real special motivation or idea in my entire life. But, I want to write a book. A book. *A Book.* See, other people have an idea that they are severely passionate about and sincerely believe it is something special they can share with the world. I just want to write A Book. I only have one fascination, and that is with myself. I smell my own farts, and have googled the benefits of eating my own cum (but hate my potential progeny to enough to actually go through with it though). I drink, and am in fact, intoxicated right now, because I don’t like dealing with the fact that I am a floundering, balding, 23-year old man who has few distinguishing characteristics that will yield a financial profit.

30,"I just don't really care about what I'm taking anymore.

Small background. I come from a family of accountants, engineers, and nurses. Everyone went to university so it felt like the natural course of life. I was a great student in high school but I didn't know what I wanted to take so by default my mom helped me apply to the business school to take accounting cause why not. First year of university made me very depressed and I learned accounting wasn't for me and went for Marketing and Management Information Systems(MIS) instead. I'm pretty okay at Marketing and I guess I'm alright at MIS. I even got a part time job as a Marketing Assistant and do pretty well.

However, I'm just finding that I really really don't care for school anymore. I'll listen in class but I find it's more so to be part of discussions and make my professor happy as opposed to me being engaged in the subject. More and more the idea of failing courses and wasting money doesn't bother me at all. I skip classess so often to do absolutely anything else. I also don't really see myself working jobs in either of my majors for my whole life. School just feels like a thing I need to finish for my family as opposed to a stepping stone for my future. 

I still need 11 courses to take and 2 co-op terms to fulfill which means around 2 more years of school. We have a month long family trip back to our home country happening in 8 months and I'm choosing to take a semester off. I can't express just how excited I am for it. I'm scared I'll like it too much. 

I'm realizing that there's other things I absolutely love doing more than school. Like singing and playing the piano. I'm no beyonce but Ive always loved to sing. In HS I spent every lunch hour in choir not once questioning what I'm doing there. I recently bought some online courses for both piano and singing and I find myself getting so pleasantly lost in both activities. I could do it all day. Sometimes I play till I start falling asleep at the piano. I love it. I fantasize of one day just singing everyday. Training and being part of musicals. When I run through dream scenerios in my head where I win the lottery and don't have to worry about money, all I can think of is spending my days training in music, teaching kids how wonderful music is, and other creative activities like making cotton candy art and starting a business with that. ( I serve cotton candy for birthday parties part-time and sometimes I like to make sculptures with the cotton candy for the kids).

But all this comes back to where I'm at now; spending most of my days in school for marketing and MIS and working as an assistant marketer. But all the while I really just can't wait to get home and play the piano.

I have no clue what to do. ",05Apr2019,1

I’m now trying to be happy and to enjoy the moment, for I realized suffering is something that depends on us; happiness also comes from us; and love (like every type of love) is alien to ourselves. I just want people to realize that pain exists, but we may choose whether we suffer from it and most importantly, how much it changes other people’s lives.

38,"My name is Gabriel, but you can call me Gabe.. I'm a 20 year old fellow , and I can say I witnessed the pass from a generation to another (how fast people got over flip-phones and got to the first Android phone, the way Cartoon Network changed, etc.).

 I'm a 20 year old student at the tehnical university in Romania, a university I can say I like, but something I got as a second option... Might stall a little while trying to write this post guys, most likely because this isn't my first language.. But anyway.

It wasn't my first option.

My first option was to choose something like Graphic Design (you know, doing digital art /animations/models, those kind of things) but no luck. I had no such option here, only by leaving the country, and by no means I'm a rich guy, nor my parents.

You might be wondering, why am I writing this post? Well, this will be like a journal, in which I'll try to post daily about my life, at least a little, so you can see what I'm dealing with... The dread your brain can leave you up with.

I am not a happy person, you might have heard this before, but I really ain't. Since I was 16 I knew something was wrong... The way everything seemed to lose it's colours, the way every relationship between some members of my family changed drastically, from the way my parents weren't happy with my achievements, and by the fact I wanted to see my brother, which my parents had fought with before. This whole ""I want to see my brother thing"" was prohibited"" so I got sick of things. I started hating doing the same shit over and over...

I avoided the rules and visited my brother while my parents were at work. My parents are really serious people. They are caring, but at the same time, they like to emotionally manipulate you, and the fights I had to endure with them were horrible, but I'll come to that later.

So I got to my brother now and then, and everything was great. He gave me the first cigarette ever (I don't regret it), and damn it felt good. Still remember how dizzy it got me, and how I tried to do smoke circles everytime.

But my parents found out. Then the hell started. They started to say things to me that even to this day I remember and they hurt, but I forgave them anyway. They started telling me how they try everything, and how ungrateful I am, that I'm a liar, and they kept comparing me to other classmates, the one being my neighbour (a piece of shit backstabber, that I don't keep in contact with anymore). When I got a 10 at something, they didn't really congratulate me, but God forbid to get a lower grade than that... If I got a 9, they asked me what grades did the others take, if they got a 10, they were dissapointed. For a 9...

Like it all mattered, like the whole grade system was going to help me achieve something.. The things got colder between me and them, and even hatred started to show its fangs. The fighting got worse, with some things being my father getting violent. Not violent like beating the living shit out of me, but violent enough to get scared of ever showing affection and love towards him. A strange feeling started to gather inside of me, just like morning fog. It was weird and painful. It was just like sadness, but it felt like you can't do anything about it. Like you want to cry, but can't... So I wanted to give up. I was stuck with threats that if I don't do as they say, when I'm 18 I'm free to leave. In this way I wouldn't have been able to get to uni. And the thing I wanted the least was to work as ordinary people, with the mind I have. (Don't want to show off or something, but I've done the official IQ test and got a score of 127, which is superior if I recall)
I wanted to finish uni, it was like a dream. But the feeling inside me got worse, not only because while others could go out and have fun, I was stuck studying useless garbage, like history or geography, at a profile which had the main focus math and physics. But oh no, they didn't get it... they didn't get it that no matter how your grades are, the only thing that matters are the final exams.
The fights and coldness grew stronger and stronger, meanwhile they became more aggresive by words... 

This was one problem. I couldn't see my brother, I couldn't get out, I couldn't have fun. I couldn't do anything... I was stuck at home. I had to study my ass on things that now I don't even remember. But if I wanted to hangout, wow... Not possible. 
They forced me to memorize crap. 

You might say ""but how did you want to hangout at 15, why are you such a crybaby?"", well we live in a small town, mostly a ghost town with no crimes and such... I also was at the age butterflies started to kick in. I wanted a girl so bad... Seeing girls in my class at 14-15 hanging with 18 guys really got me hopeless. I thought to myself ""damn I wished I was 18"". 
The experience I had with a girl (by experience I mean falling in love with) was at 10-11. While she was 12-13. She didn't want to be in a relationship with me though, because she simply didn't. And then I heard rumors from some so called friend which I used to go and visit this girl from the neighbours. (we were good friends then) that I am skinny, and that there is this guy from Canada she likes and that looks way better than me. Hearing this at 10-11 sparked a determination in me to make myself look better. So I started working out (push-ups, sit-ups and things I could do that age). In the end she still said no. I was left with a feeling that whatever I do, I can't change my appearance. I have to live with how I look. Many times I looked in the mirror or in photos, I could only see how skinny and unappealing I was... I kept making photos and deleting them because I wasn't happy with them... 

Damn I must've been typing for an hour, my fingers hurt... I'll continue up tomorrow. Let me know if I can update a post, so I won't have to do multiple posts, maybe people won't like that the subreddit is filled by me lol. Anyways thanks for following up, for whoever ripped a bit of their time to hear my story. This is just a small part though, I have more to tell...

I have beef with some people and I dont know if its them or law enforcement. I dont break the law so I dont know why they would be fucking with me, and although I hate the people I got that friction with, I dont think they high tech like that to pull that off and listen to my calls but it feels like it.

So I dont know... I feel like punching the guy just off the strength of them listening but I cant proove it and I been had friction with them and never did shit yet cuz I got better things to do, they just annoying and I hate their face(s)....

42,"I’ve been single for two years prior to I was in a 1.5yr relationship with my first everything (kiss, sex, everything). When things turned sour I was in a bad place. Miserable, uncertain if I could live without him. But, I can!! And I have!! Living tf out of my life. 

I swore off any major commitments when we ended bc it was SO emotionally exhausting to endure the downfall of the relationship and to just be in a relationship in general. Since, I’ve “dated” around however, recently I’ve been more willing to settle down. I need help, a partner, someone in my corner. Due to my current living situation I pushed the idea to the back of my mind and redirected myself back to myself and my next life steps. 

Then, I remembered this guy I met (he’s older, 30. I like older. Young guys are idiots) that lights a fire in me that burns so good. He asked me on a date I do admit that things got physical on the first date but I wouldn’t change a thing about it. 

When I’m with him I feel like he sees as the woman I’m becoming. I feel more myself, more relaxed. Sometimes he says stuff and it’s almost like he was placed here specifically for me.

45,"Edit: I apologize because I get a bit rambly. This post sort of turned into a vent but any advice or just hearing some words from other people would be nice.  
Original post:  
I'll try to spare unnecessary details, but first of all, I must say, it really sucks being a dude who has low libido. Especially going through high school, getting girlfriends, and not being able to fuck them. You have no idea how much that sucks (if it hasn't happened to you, that is...). My girlfriends and I at the time pretty much tried everything else (sex-wise) and they even tried to suck me off at times but I could never get hard enough for penetration. It was frustrating for me and especially for them too, no doubt. One girl thought it was her fault because she wasn't ""attractive enough"" and she got super self-conscious about it, but I assured her that I was actually very attracted to her and I really cared about her, and she was also a very beautiful girl as well. I'm not sure what the cause was for my low libido back then (remember, this is 9+ years ago in high school), but I will say, at the time, I did stupidly masturbate on average about once a day and I did watch porn (seriously, don't watch porn... especially if you have a girlfriend and have low libido and ED problems, as it no doubt makes it WORSE, probably...). So, in hindsight, maybe if I didn't masturbate to porn or masturbate at all, maybe those handfuls of times I got the opportunity for intercourse with my girlfriends I would have been able to get it up. Also, some of the times I was completely sober but I did smoke tobacco in high school a little bit. This was all back in the years around 2011 when I graduated.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a few years later (around 2014)... I'm still not really trying to pursue relationships because of, 1: low libido, and 2: fear of embarrassing ED. But, I finally decided to try going out with a girl again. I ask a girl out, we go on a nice walk, etc. But, a date or two later, when the time came for sex, like, we were just chilling in her room with her friend and her friend was like ""I gotta go now"" and it was just her and I in her room and she was sort of sitting on the middle of her bed just staring at me, wearing a dress with I think no underwear on, I was like yep, in my head, just knowing that I wasn't horny and if I tried to have sex I would just have ED. No matter how much in my head I'm like ""It would be fun to have sex with this girl I really like, I really want to have that connection with someone."" my brain is just like ""Nope, too fucking bad bucko, I will just make it impossible for you and make your dick shrink every time you get close to having sex with a girl."". So... I just sat there and sort of talked to her. A couple of weeks later I see her in town again and ask if she wants to go out again but yeah, that never happened.  


Fast forward to the present moment, and for these many years I have still just had low libido, haven't pursued any relationships. I've had people think I'm gay (relatives, some old friends, etc), and I honestly don't care that they think that, but I assure them basically that I'm not and just don't have a desire for a girlfriend or I come up with some other excuse like ""I'm busy in school, etc"". It's very dumb.  


Anyways, I also had a doctors appointment a week ago and told my doctor about it. I'm getting my testosterone levels checked and some other things. I am completely healthy (normal blood pressure, BMI, no diseases, etc). I don't smoke or drink (like at all) or take any medication or do other drugs. I don't think I have anxiety or depression. I'm not sure what the cause of this problem is but I can tell you that I am damn TIRED of it. I feel like a huge component of my life has been missing and I've just been ignoring it for these past 9 years. I haven't even masturbated in 30 days to see if I'll build up some ""horniness levels"" but really, I have never truly been uncontrollably horny my whole life.",05Apr2019,2

52,"When I was younger I wanted to be an actor. I remember the very moment the thought came to me. It just popped into my head and I was like “oh yeah! Of course that’s it” it was pretty eurekaeske, if that’s a word. I was walking to junior high school in 7th grade right by the flagpole. 
Anyway so I have this acting bug now. I tell my mother. It was weird she didn’t seem that supportive or excited that I knew what I wanted to do, but she signed me up for this class over at Brooklyn College. So now I’m in the acting class and they have us doing crazy things like yoga and playing these weird games and the body movement classes, I thought it was all a little strange. But at the end of the course we put on a show. Now I honestly wholeheartedly swear to god just walked into this thing wanting a small role with nothing too crazy. I just wanted get my feet wet so I could try out this acting thing. The director of the program was named Shirley. I’ll never forget her. She was amazing. She believed in me more than anyone ever did and she was so nice to me and she told me I could do it and then boom. She makes me the lead role of Atticus Finch in “To Kill A Mockingbird”. My mom was ecstatic and I was happy but a part of me was like oh shit don’t screw this up! I don’t mean to be coy I really was excited and nervous and scared and most importantly grateful. So the show goes on and I kill I mean I got standing ovations, flowers, my high school girlfriend came it was just phenomenal I was in top of the world. Really one of the high points of my life. And I was so good! 
So now I’m a huge hit right and Ms. Parkinson is very pleased with my work there’s a little buzz in the air about the program and new people are coming in now. So in walks this new kid. This little shit, Evan. He wasn’t really a little shit he was a very nice kid who even looked like me a little bit but I’m obviously more charming and handsome. He’s in the program now. It’s a new program with a new curriculum and a new play. This god damn play. Shirley chose the morality play called “Everyman”. If you’re a theater major you know what I’m talking about. If
not, don’t worry about it you’re missing a snooze fest. The play is very old and it’s basically a tale of a guy dying and searching the afterlife for his soul or something I don’t know. But this guy is the symbol of every guy and even girl that’s why it’s called Everyman. Its a daunting task to be this main character the guy never gets off the stage he has 9 egregious monologues and he also represents every person who ever lived! It’s a huge undertaking. Now in the play Everyman obviously has to die right so there’s a character called Death. Death is such a perfect character. The dude just comes in looking all badass. He kills Everyman, he has this 1 amazing monologue. And then boom away he goes he’s never seen again. I wanted that part! Man oh man could I tell you how I rehearsed the shit out if that part and pictured myself doing it in this low voice all scary and dark and badass. So casting day comes. And guess who has Death, and guess who plays Everyman. Little kiss ass over there gets Death and I get stuck as being the asshole who never gets off the stage and has to memorize damn near the whole play. 
Now just a little sidebar. This all wasn’t happening when I was in my 20s I was in like the 8th grade at this point I was just a damn kid. And it was around this time as I happened to be just a kid, I discovered marijuana. Marijuana for all intents and purposes ruined my life. And this is pretty much the first time it did. 
So I’m nervous about this play man. I mean I have a whole script to memorize. My guy never gets off the stage. I even have to know the other people’s lines to know when my cue to talk is. It’s not like I’ll be going anywhere during the whole play to skip a scene or something. Nerves started to lean me toward smoking weed. And the smoking weed started to lean me towards not caring about the show. I studied whenever I wasn’t high. I got through about half the play. The other half I don’t know I guess I thought I would cram it or just magically learn it. I kept telling Shirley I didn’t know my lines and she just must’ve thought I had the jitters. 
It. Was. A. Fucking. Nightmare. 
Halfway through the play they should’ve changed the name to Iceman because I was just frozen and trying to scramble for lines or I’m saying older lines. The other actors were breaking character looking at each other and just saying the lines and skipping mine. It was bad. And while I’m in stage their consoling me because I didn’t know my lines but also those characters console Everyman so I guess it kind of worked. But it was just awful. It was the most embarrassing moment of my life. People in the audience walked out of the show, including that same high school girlfriends mother. I wanted to die. But guess who was there to kill me, stupid Evan. In the beginning of the play as Death, he runs in really fast and yells his entire monologue. I’m talking YELLED. It was the most over the top, obnoxious, worst performance I’ve ever seen. And in the middle of the play he gets a standing ovation! For killing me! On the ride home my mother talked about how good he was.  When the play ended Shirley gave me two sets of roses. She told the audience it was because I worked very hard. But deep down I knew she knew I didn’t. And I also knew I didn’t. And that really was what broke my heart. I let everybody in that theater down and I ruined that damn play. And I let that son of a bitch save it. 
Later on he used to go door to door selling sets of steak knives. My mother bought a set, they were in our kitchen. Of course she said I should sell steak knives like him. Now he owns restaurants and travels the world. I just took a cold shower because of a leaky faucet. ",05Apr2019,2

I'm sure I haven't gotten it from my parents, as they've always promoted it. It's not the type of decision that I'd trust them to make though.

Dear ex-best friend,

yesterday I woke up to an email you wrote to me. When I first saw the mail on my mobile phone, I was pretty sure that it must have been a mistake. That a random dude wrote the mail and inserted the wrong email. But then I began reading. It was really you.   
I was still in my bed but after the first few sentences I put down my phone. I was crying and shaking. We haven't been friends for over a year now, because of stupid little things that piled up and crashed down on us. Since then I've tried at least twice to contact you and to work things out with you. But you weren't ready. So I stopped. I stopped believing that there was any hope for the two of us and while it hurt like hell at first, I found new friends. And slowly my wounds healed.

My first instinct, after I realised that the mail truly was from you, was to contact one of those new friends. She is the sweetest girl I know, but I also know that you never liked her. But that's the problem, you never liked anyone that tried to be my friend. I was supposed to be yours alone. And I wanted to be yours. I really did.  
But you know what hurt? That you had so many other friends and acquaintances. And me? Back when we were friends I only had you and my fiancee. But even my fiancee seemed to be too much for you. I often tried to get involved with your other friends, but you always had excuses, why I couldn't join you guys. But I was kinda okay with having only you as a friend. We had a great time, we really did. Talking with you every evening for hours was the thing I looked forward to all day long.   
One thing I noticed way later, was that those long phonecalls never helped me at all. They made me depressed. We weren't helping each other, we were just pulling each other down. 

Our friendship lasted roughly a year, but it felt like we had known each other for so much longer. We were so similar. And that was our downfall. Do you remember the first times we spoke? I told you back then that I would not be a good friend. I'm a borderliner and you know that. I'm not ashamed to admit it, but I wanted to warn you. It can be really tough to be around me sometimes. You didn't care. You said you love me either way. And I loved you even more for that. But from the beginning, I was afraid that I would fuck things up. And eventually, I did. 

I wasn't a nice person to be around sometimes, but I always apologised, maybe too much. Back then we worked things out, tried to move on and continued being us. Sadly the peace didn't last long. Both of us were afraid sometimes that we would hurt each other, so we kept quiet about things that bothered us. Until one day everything exploded. We throw accusation after accusation at each other. In the end, we both agreed that we should take a break. That we need space. But just a few days later you messaged me, telling me that you don't want to see me ever again.

I was heartbroken. I tried to understand what went wrong, but nothing made sense. For the first time in forever, I talked to other people about personal things. I talked about you and asked them about their opinion on the situation. Not once have I said anything bad about you, because after everything: You were my best friend.  
The other people slowly became my friends. Those friendships are not as intense as the one we had, but that's good. It's not only me and one other person. It's me and many wonderful people that I can share my life with. 

In your email, you asked me if I would like to be your friend again, you said that I should do what I think is right and not do what I think you want. You explained your side of the story and I understood. Finally, after one year everything started to make sense. Well, at least kind of. And I really wanted to answer that I wanted to be your friend again. I really did. Because after all, I still love you. And I miss you more than you can probably imagine. But maybe you can imagine because you told me that you miss me too. And that you love me as well.  
But I didn't. Instead, I told you that we couldn't be friends anymore. Why? Because I was crying and shaking out of fear the whole time. I was afraid that everything would return to the state it was a year ago. 

I have an amazing life now. Seriously, I love basically every second of it. Sure there are tough times, but I have friends and the most wonderful fiancee one could ever wish for. I am getting married in two months and I am getting a dog this summer. I was afraid you would tell me how bad all of this was. And I was even more afraid that I would believe you. Because that is what I did: I always believed you. Every little thing you told me.  
And I am so grateful that I had my new friend at my side. She listened to my thoughts and eventually told me that I had to decide myself, but that she would be really worried about me if I tried to be friends with you again because you would eventually brake me. I was worried too. That's the reason I said no.

I tried to write the email as nice as possible and I explained why I couldn't be friends with you anymore. I really believed that you would agree that it was for the best for both of us. But when you answered you weren't understanding at all. You insulted me. You probably were frustrated, I understand, but that was enough to show me that my decision was the right one.   
Do you know what else told me that I made the right decision? That the friend, which I consulted when I got your mail, told me that she would love to be my best friend. And then she did everything to brighten up my mood. She is amazing, she truly is. And she never judges me, she always lets me have my own opinion and she loves to share her friends with me.

In the end, I want to say just one last thing: I forgive you for every time you hurt me. And I hope that one day you can forgive me for every time I hurt you. When we both are healed completely, then maybe we can try again, but not now. Not for the next year. Maybe after that. Who knows.

I wish you all the best, because once upon a time you were my best friend.

After all, I still love you.

And I miss you.",05Apr2019,13
90,"I (23F) recently have been going to counseling and my counselor suggested I get some assessments done for multiple mental health issues. She said she saw some signs of anxiety, depression, relying too heavily on the same coping skills, and trauma.

94,"I'm on day 14 of an intensive self-improvement challenge. The results thus far have been life changing. I used to suffer from a severe sense of low self-esteem, a poor understanding of self worth and would over exhaust my energy on people &amp; things that would feel good in the moment, but leave me low down and broken in the next.  

One of the most important changes I've noticed is my ability to now ""rewire"" my patterns of thought. 

The hardest thing, and in retrospect most heartbreaking thing, was this ever-growing sensation of self doubt and self guilt that would literally overwhelm me every time I said no to somebody or would stand up for myself in situations where I had every right to stand in opposition. 

I was highly sympathetic to those who were hurting me, and it was breaking me down A  L O T.  I was also extremely easy to manipulate. 

In some sense, I felt like I was a victim to myself. I felt I was forever going to be the kid that was essentially a doormat. In all honesty, this scared me. I hated it. I hated it so much. I would feel so useful to others, but absolutely useless to myself. I would justify my worth through the acts I would show in service projects, or simply being of service to others on small-scale interactions. 

The truth about this is that it sucked the life out of me, and devalued important relationships. I would consistently question how much of my relationships were based off of genuine joy and desire to be around me versus me just providing a good time, and seeking approbation from the person I was spending time with. 

&amp;#x200B;

The relationships I've strengthened and developed over the past 2 weeks do not leave me questioning what is and what it not genuine. The things I do in my free time ( like graphic design, kayaking and writing) are things I do to better myself. I can do these things alone, and feel like I'm actively feeding a portion of myself FOR myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm steadily learning how to ""snap"" myself out of the ""maybe I shouldn't have done that to this person, because it may have hurt them"" when they outright mean to me. ( Just as a note: I don't do mean things to people, but I had to exit a few relationships in which I realized I was being mistreated. I sometimes second guess myself on leaving, but the truth is those were the relationships that really hurt me and caused a lot of pain, and I don't want to carry those relationships with me as they stand in the way of my well being). 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also learning how to love stronger, be more fair and how to set my boundaries. I can take compliments, and I can say ""No, I'm doing this right now so I really don't want to do that until what I'm doing is done."" I'm learning roles of leadership, and I'm able to tap into healthy amounts of empathy versus nonsensical amounts that eventually spiral me into a pit of depression. 

&amp;#x200B;

Things are looking good. I've got 4 more weeks to go. It hasn't been easy, nor has it been comfortable, but I can hardly relate to the person that I was before I started all of this.

right now am 20 years old and i will be 21 in next month, i finished high school last year ( i know that you should finish high school by the age of 18 but i didn't go to school until i was like 8 )

and my problem is that I am a fucking loser and pathetic overweight LAZY person. ( don't get me wrong am smart in school i used to get straight A+s in every exam and i was like the top kid in my school and even my teachers where saying i will become something great someday and they encouraged me so much, looking back to that makes me cry coz i don't deserve that , every single time i put for myself goals that i want to accomplish, not just any goals, they are really really important and big GOALS like starting to work out and getting fit, starting an online business that I know that i can success in it if i get FUCKING DISCIPLINED , but i wasted an entire year doing nothing, right now the school year will end in a month so it is a full year since i was graduated from high school and am still the same LAZY USELESS BROKE KID i was in high school am really really tired of this, every time i sit goals for myself and get motivated to start chasing my dreams

i get back into my old BAD HABITS, masturbation + League of legends Addiction + not going out any more just staying at home playing video games and masturbating am really ashamed of myself while am writing this post to you, fuck my life

fuck every thing am really tired.

On the pettiness. So the fucking oldass cat pissed in my blue chair. Fine its old and such. But my dad and his wife don't even think cleaning it with toiletpaper and puting fuckin baking soda on the stains and just put it outside on the balcony cuz it stinks. And im pissed when i hear that. 

So i went, in a fucking dark and cold, balcony and put the fucking baking soda on it. It seems to work, than goodness. I don't wanna leave it the balcony (and out of spite) i first put it in upstairs wc. Baking soda should stay on it for a night and in the morning i wacuum it off. 

And then my stubid ass says cuz a fucking common curtesy that it's in the wc to his wife. She says i should leave it on the balcony, i say no. I get upstairs and hear she say to my dad : ""go talk sense to your daughter.""

My dad comes and we talk. He says ofc that the chair stinks (but iy doesnt stink anymore cuz i put the fucking baking soda on it) He says that he would clean it tomorrow with the furniture hose-thing. Never mind that he will be all day gone for some martial arts hobby he has. I say that we can hose the chair if the baking soda doesnt work. And i might have said that they are two fucking adults, so they should suck it up and endure the non exsistent smell. Then he says: ""then what are u?"" I few months a go turned 18. Then he questions if i even use the damm chair, bitch it's still mine.

He says that if i want to have it inside, i put it in my room with door shut. I do that and we are coolish. Then i get witt and start throwing my billow around. Feel good.

124,"""The ill person only has one wish, the healthy one many"" people say.
And it proves true, for the 3 years I was ill, I had only one wish, to find a cure.
When I was pulling through with the last power I had left, I was determined to go through any risk, for the best possible outcome. I don't regret that decision in any way, I would probably not be here today if it wasnt for that surgery.
But back then, I thought that would be all I need for the rest if my life to e happy, health. A part of my mind is ashamed not to be happy.
The large scars across my stomach and thigh dont bother me.. but other things do.
For those three years I could barely eat, everything I ate something, even just a bite or a sip, would make pressure build up in my stomach, it was a terrible pressure pain that would last hours on end and make me nauseous.
But I *have* to eat after all, I had lost 15 kg in the first 6 weeks and was down at 38kg by the time of surgery. So what I did was to eat one bite of dry toast every few minutes, bite of toast and wait until the pressure in my stomach is endurable enough again so I can eat the next piece.
You can imagine that was a very slow process, so I was eating all the time, ever so slowly, just toast, day and night as I could barely sleep anyways from hunger.
It was terrible, feeling how your body begins shaking and your vision going black from your energy being so low, but your stomach refusing to stop hurting and feeling like it is about to explode, so you just lie there or grit your teeth and eat, making the pain worse.
Now that I can eat again, I can barely stop, I noticed that I havent shaken off that habit of eating as soon as I feel I can take it, I feel the urge to eat even if I am nit really hungry. The surgery is 6 months back now, and as someone who values aesthetic.. I have begun to dislike my body, my stomach is constantly bloated and looks as if I am pregnant, my face which was like porcelain before, is now full of pimples,  none of the pants I wore even before I got ill fit anymore. I was never like this, I weigh as much now as I did before my illness, but somehow I seem to be fatter...   maybe it it because I had more muscle before all this which weighs more than fat, while I am currently not allowed to really exercise just yet... I dont know...

So I've felt insecure about my intelligence for a very long time; although I was one of the best students in school, I felt like all I had was ""booksmarts"" and no actual intelligence. Over time, this insecurity's been getting worse and worse with me helplessly standing by. It's gotten to the level where the slightest joke that I've done or said something ""dumb"" or ""stupid"" etc makes me incredibly uncomfortable and anxious . I try not to show it, but I think it's obvious. 


This habit of making a big deal out of literally nothing has taken on its most ridiculous form today. So I had an exam, and at the end of the exam there was a harmless/fun crossword puzzle to do with the course, with bonus points awarded for solving it. Well, I wasn't able to solve it, and just handed in the exam paper. I shit you not, right after I left my mind spiralled into thoughts of ""how stupid are you"" ""can't even do something this simple"" ""you're never gonna achieve anything with your level of stupidity"" etc... and I ended up wallowing in a pit of self hate over a fucking crossword puzzle.

134,"I was reminded this morning to check my credit score which i do at the start of every month, and honestly it made me stupidly happy to see it go up for the second time this year.

I have spent so long with a terrible credit rating and i think i had resigned to it never really getting better. I made some stupid decisions when i was younger and paid the price, but i have learned alot about money and not letting people take advantage of my good nature.

&amp;#x200B;

In January my score took a random dive and im still yet to understand why, it honestly broke me and cemented my view of it never getting better. But in February it hit 370 and it made me irrationally happy. I recently upgraded my car and paid off the old one, im guessing thats why its gone up again this month.

138,"I am one in millions with OCD. I am fifteen years old, and for anonymities sake, my name is Lily. I’ve always liked flowers, so a floral-themed name seems appropriate. Being able to pick my own pseudonym is one of the better, more exciting things to happen to me in the last month, a bleak but satirical look into my current situation. That is of course, if you like weak, depressing satire that you probably would’ve got out of a mental-illness themed christmas cracker.
Excuse my self-depreciation, i’m aware it's a turnoff for many. That’s depression unfortunately. And the worst thing is? It doesn’t even make me remotely funny. It’s more woe-is-me self depreciation than anything else, whereas i’m looking for the simple comedy-flow-is-me typa vibe. 

Earlier on, I mentioned I have OCD. Now if you’re imagining a quirky teenage girl cleaning everything that comes into sight with a broom like some clinically insane harry potter then i’m sorry but you’ve got the wrong end of the stick, or broom, if you fancy (not the clinically-insane bit, I can assure you that’s 100% true). 
In all honesty, my OCD is nothing like that. To be even more honest with you, I don’t think i’ve ever come into contact with a broom in my life. A mop? Sure. But a broom? Nope. Never had the chance. Maybe I should add that to my bucket list, of which I recently crossed off ‘attempting and failing suicide’. Too soon? Ah well, it’s my comedy routine, I can say what I like. 

I have a type of OCD entitled ‘pure O’, which is less commonly mentioned by the media simply because they like to portray a stereotype which for many, isn’t true. They hide from the facts like I hide from, well, everything. 
Basically, I have an intense fear i’m going to harm someone, may it be a friend, family member, partner, whoever it is, I get scared i’ll harm or abuse them, so I have to monitor everything I do. Sit, talk, walk, lie down, anything. I’m basically the shittest human being the world has ever known. I can’t do anything without worrying about it. I’m beginning to become aware that this isn’t all that funny and actually rather sad, so let’s move on to the joyful topic of psychiatric medicine. 

Because of the intensity of my thoughts i’m on antipsychotics. I’m also on diazepam (or valium, if ya nasty) along with antidepressants. It’s a fun combo. The thing is, the side effects of these aren’t so fun. Firstly, let me address the hunger. I feel like a pregnant woman at the moment with all the food i’m craving. If I really was a pregnant woman, that’d be concerning and probably a matter for social services considering i’m only fifteen. 
I digress.
 
My appetite never ends. Within 24 hours I ate three cheesecakes. Three. That has to be some sort of record. If the comedy career doesn’t work out, I reckon cheesecake eating is my best bet. I could even land myself on one of those ‘my strange addiction’ programmes. That’d be my claim to fame. I’d have no shame. Cheesecakes are the best, after all, and they don’t come with all the emotional baggage that people do. 
Next on the list is the sleepiness. I think this is down to the antipsychotics but I reckon Mr Valium has been poking his head in there somewhere as well. I feel sleepy ALL THE TIME and it’s not like a good ‘high’ sleepy (although, let’s be real, apart from all these meds I take. I’m too scared to ever experience ‘proper’ drugs, so I guess i’ll never know what getting high really does feel like), it's just an exhausted, run down feeling. Like i’ve just been to the gym (again-never gonna happen). Christ, that’s an overused joke. I might as well be the brunette, teenage Amy Schumer. 

Many people ask me what being on a ward full of other teenagers with mental health problems is like. Actually, it’s pretty okay. I’m on a ‘therapeutic ward’ so the kids are generally very nice, as are the staff. I wish I had funny anecdotes, but unfortunately this isn’t ‘Girl Interrupted’ and i’m not Winona Ryder...or Angelina Jolie for that matter (I wish). People believe psychiatric hospitals are big scary places but, in my case anyway, that simply just isn’t true. It’s where poorly people go to get better. Hah. Who am I kidding. They may be poorly and that’s true but, let’s be honest, I myself am completely mental. Who else would spend hours upon end adjusting the way they walk so they don’t hurt their relative. That’s me, kids. I’m a headcase. I guess part of my therapy is coming to terms with that. 

It’s now 11pm and i’ve been writing this for hours so I think i’m gonna call it a night on the ‘comedy’. I hope you enjoyed, got a laugh, or at least learnt something from it. 

Yours sincerely,

Lily x,

I've never done this type of running before, but I've always been an okay runner and have done softball since kindergarten besides this year (I'm in 10th grade). So all of this is new to me.

I was literally hacking and gagging up until the fourth one. My hands were (still kinda are) numb. I was soaked. But I fucking pushed through. My time had to be by 1 minute 35 seconds, we also got 5 minute breaks in between. First two- 1:25. Next three- 1:30. Last one- 1:28. In a meet I can run 1:16-18, but I obviously was not going to push myself that much for SIX times.

I've always wanted that, simply doing anything related to music every day of my life has always been my goal, and now I'm finally working on it. My parents are still together, and we get on great. I just moved out into a pretty great appartment, and I get by quite easily. I have a pretty good job giving piano lessons to kids. I never got bullied, to the contrary, I've always had good relationships with most people I know. There's just one thing that's wrong with me.


I'm just so damn lonely. When I was in high school, I had a pretty great circle of friends, but due to them being one year lower than me because I dropped down a level, things just kind of.... faded. I still occasionally talk to one of them, but haven't seen any of them for about 15 months now. 


I feel like everyone has their own circle of people they hang out with, and I just happen to not be in any of them. Sure, when I'm at school I have a couple of people I really like, but nothing really happens outside of school.


And because of that, in the weekends I just end up being extremely bored, cycling between checking Reddit, YouTube, practising the piano or guitar and playing a game for a bit. That's pretty much it. It's gotten so bad that I'm actively fearing the weekends, even though every other person I know is waiting for them.


I always have stories to tell, (because I'm often quite busy with my job and school, which is great because I'll have less time on my hands to sit around and do nothing) but no one to tell them to. 
I have now gone home on the weekends a couple of times, but then I just end up cycling through the same things, with my parents wondering why I'm not doing anything or seeing anyone.


I simply don't really know what to do to be honest. Whenever I get invited to anything I go, and its always alright, but I just don't really feel at home, I guess. I feel like every person I know has a ton of people they talk to and hang out with, and that I just got unlucky, and I know that's bullshit, but it still feels like that.

But I *have* to eat after all, I had lost 15 kg in the first 6 weeks and was down at 38kg by the time of surgery. So what I did was to eat one bite of dry toast every few minutes, bite of toast and wait until the pressure in my stomach is endurable enough again so I can eat the next piece.
You can imagine that was a very slow process, so I was eating all the time, ever so slowly, just toast, day and night as I could barely sleep anyways from hunger.
It was terrible, feeling how your body begins shaking and your vision going black from your energy being so low, but your stomach refusing to stop hurting and feeling like it is about to explode, so you just lie there or grit your teeth and eat, making the pain worse.
Now that I can eat again, I can barely stop, I noticed that I havent shaken off that habit of eating as soon as I feel I can take it, I feel the urge to eat even if I am nit really hungry. The surgery is 6 months back now, and as someone who values aesthetic.. I have begun to dislike my body, my stomach is constantly bloated and looks as if I am pregnant, my face which was like porcelain before, is now full of pimples,  none of the pants I wore even before I got ill fit anymore. I was never like this, I weigh as much now as I did before my illness, but somehow I seem to be fatter...   maybe it it because I had more muscle before all this which weighs more than fat, while I am currently not allowed to really exercise just yet... I dont know...

I just feel awful....
