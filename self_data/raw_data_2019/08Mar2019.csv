7,"Hi All,

I just wanted to write a piece on ex's. I feel like this has probably been done to death but here goes.

So here's the bottom line - If your current partner/date has an ex that broke up with them, there is a high risk you will lose this person to the ex should they decide to be vocal again. Factors that do not play a part in this are

1. Looks - the ex can be far less attractive than you, this does not matter. 

2. Current happiness - you could be in a loving/caring relationship. If the ex comes back into the picture it can mess with the head of your partner and cause them to rethink what you have.

3. Trust - You may think your partner is trustworthy but this can all go out the window should the ex get in touch.

So far this post may come across as slightly bitter (partially true) but I have also been on the other side of this issue.

Now, this does not apply to every ex in someone's past, it applies to the ex that hit the emotional spot (no pun intended) first. The ex that created those first unique experiences for your current partner. I also dont believe there is a set time for someone to get over this type of ex, I believe they stay emotionally connected forever. So when it comes to dating it is important to find out if an ex like this exists. If they do, then its something you need to talk about before getting comfortable.

I am this ex to someone else and I have an ex who is this to me. I could be in love in a years time and my last ex could get in touch, I'd 100% want to hear what they had to say. 

Thanks Reddit. Interested on your thoughts when it comes to ex's.

Tl;dr - If your current partner/date has an ex that broke their heart, its likely yours will end up broken as well.

11,"Hello! I'm currently in High School and I'm on my Senior year. This year, I decided to do something very different and something my parents didn't expect. That is to take the next level of Strength Training. When I told them, they just pulled the most parent-card known to man and said, ""Oh, awesome! Hope you have fun."" And.. that was it, I expected a ... more .. I don't know, something more than that. Whatever. 

Fun fact: My Strength Training class is my first block. Meaning... I workout at 7:15AM to 8:45AM.

Stepping back a tad, I took Strength Training in my Freshman year, it absolutely sucked ass as the activities were mainly cardio workouts. But still was decent fun. Plus the coach was hardcore, so that didn't help. Fast forward 3 years later, sitting in the locker room and getting dressed. And then the class had started. Intermediate Strength Training.

Now, that was around 5 weeks ago. Just saying that so y'all don't get lost in my sea of words. But, this week, *it* started. ... CrossFit. CrossFit for those who don't know is a series of workouts that you have to do in a time limit. These workouts most, if not all the time, push you to your limit. So, the CrossFit we had to do last Tuesday was setup like this: Dumbbell Squat Press and Burpee box jumps. Now here's how many we have to do of each. 10(DSP)-10(BBJ), 20-10, 30-10 and finally 40-10. We HAD to do both arms FYI, so really, 5 DSP on one arm and 5 on the other(=10), so on and so forth. We HAD to do all of this under 12 minutes. If you went over the time limit and you finish, that's a D. But under 12 is an A. 

Now that that is out of the way. It was finally my turn, I did the painful ass CrossFit, nearly died and got 8 mins. 31secs. Now this is the start of my accomplishment. After that workout, I was happily ready to lay on my death bed. I could barely walk without my legs shaking like twigs. I felt accomplished for ... that day alone. But little did I know. I forgot we also did our maxouts on the same week. And the day after.. was Deadlift maxouts. Yup, everyone in my class saw it coming but boy we we're so NOT ready to do maxouts right after CrossFit. 

Next morning feeling sore as hell. Especially my back. It was the day. Deadlift maxouts. I wasn't expecting what I was getting myself into. Like seriously, this is one HELL of a day that I won't forget for my entire life. But anyways. I got dressed as per usual and me and my class wait for the teacher to tell us to do a few warm ups and get on with the maxouts. We finished our ""warmup"", which is like. 2 inside laps. And so it begins. 

Fun fact 2: My Deadlift maxouts was 265. 

Me and my workout partners started to gradually go up into the 200s. 240, 250, 265! I told them to start with 10s on each side = 285. And here's the point where I surprised myself. I HAD NO idea that I would get a new record of 285. But I swiftly picked the bar up with the best posture I could do. At this point, I was the only one going this high. My workout partners had no confidence on doing the weight I was doing. But, as my curiosity grew, my weight just kept on growing and growing. Until I hit the 300s. Now, until this point there was 3, 45 rubber pads on each side of the bronze bar(35Ibs) And, oh boy was it INTIMIDATING. Like, I'm no body builder. But christ was it huge. I took a small break after doing 295, took a breath and got some water. By now, 2 other kids were in my workout area. Equalling out to 6 kids watching me lift hell itself. I got so god damn nervous. My hands were ripped to shreads and lost some grip but I was fine. Then I took a breath. Went into a Deadlift posture and pulled. 

I couldn't believe what just happened. I fucking blew through 305. Like seriously, just a small amount of tugging when I pulled the bar. And by now, the guys were like, ""Oh you can do more!"". Me? I was like, oh shit. So, we put on two 5s, equalling out to the highest deadlift in my class, 315. By now. The entire class AND football kids were watching because they, the football kids couldn't surpass 315. So. I took a deep breath. I got into position. I waited in the posture for a good 15 seconds, pressure was real. I lifted. Hearing the rapid ""C'mons!"" from everyone in my room. And I lifted! I did a 315Ibs deadlift. One of the highest in my class. But, happy stories usually don't have happy endings because 315 is my stopping point for my maxout. But I'm very satisfied. Even if I stopped at 285 or 295. I would have been just as happy. 

I could move on to my other workout. The oh-so-exciting mile run. But I think I've made my point clear with this one story. I've never really felt so accomplished in my whole life. And the fact that I'm the kind of person that has a very low self esteem and has a severe lack of self confidence. This accomplishment wasn't just a number, it was my dedication and my motivation to become healthy as an individual. Thank you for spending your time on reading my story. And please, tell me your workout stories. I'd love to read them. Finally, sorry if my story telling is neesh. Goodbye.

*Created this account purely to speak on this topic and figured this is the best place to post what I want to say*

Before i start, interpret this as you wish, whether you make this out as a joke or not, I only want you to know, this is indeed, entirely true.

This will be split into two parts.

**Part 1 is me talking about figuring this out about people without them knowing with no explanation.**

**Part 2 is how I became so obsessed with it, that I now can't ""turn it off""**

I would like to say, this is the first time I've ever told anyone about this fully.

**Part 1**

I've always enjoyed learning and figuring out how people think, how they operate. I have spent years studying it on my own, psychology, social engineering, and just general stuff like that. I began to get a very good grasp on the concept and once had the realization that I can tell alot about people just by speaking to them. Yeah yeah, everyone can do that. I'm referring to speaking to someone for the first time, and within 15 minutes, knowing everything about them.

I'll give an example. I was once speaking to someone online about an issue regarding things not getting done in an online community and what that community could do to essentially revive it. About 20 minutes into the conversation, a bunch of stuff about that person just starting flowing to me. It wasn't the first time this has happened, by now I was quite familiar with it. Out of nowhere i knew that they were sexually abused, that they had a really close relationship with their family, that they were worried about something. But it wasn't just stuff like that, it was also just menial things like what type of food they like. I used a bit of social engineering in the sense of wording my words a certain way to see if the information i just came up with was true, and it was.

Now that what I can do is explained, I'll give a bit more of a backstory about it.

When this first happened, It happened face to face with someone. I was quite young and I just froze mid-conversation. I won't go into great detail with this as it resulted in prison for the person. But, I was being watched before and after school by a lady and her husband. They had a daughter around my age. The first few times i was there, I didn't see the husband but the first time I did. I got an unsettling feeling about him. After speaking to him, about half way through the conversation, I got the wave of information. Now, when i get waves of information, i know what it means instantly. But then, It was just a jumbled mess of information. After another minute or so of speaking to him. I figured it out. It genuinely scared me. Prison. I didn't tell anyone because, well, I had nothing to go off and if I did tell someone, what evidence would I have? To be fair I didn't even have any proof myself and didn't know if it was true, he seemed nice aside from that feeling I got. Skip all the details because this was in the news and I don't want to get doxxed. A few months later it somehow gets out, and he goes to prison for 10 years.

I was terrified. At what he did, yes, but also that I had known all this time. And even more terrified how I knew. I didn't understand and practically drove myself insane trying to put together pieces in my life that could have yielded that information to me. But to no avail. I knew it had to have something to do with, at the time, sort of looking into how people think and why they do the things they do. But I just didn't believe that with the basic to \*maybe\* average knowledge I had about it, that I could really figure this stuff out somehow. So, I started well, obsessing over it.

**Part 2**

I took the knowledge i had on stuff like psychology and social engineering and expanded it. I watched alot of videos online. Alot of movies and documentaries. Read alot of things on any subject I thought would give me some knowledge into what was happening. (Sidenote: Never read alot of books though, I hate reading books.)

I didn't learn much in the way of, knowing what was happening, if it was normal, if others could do this too. But i did get better and better at it.

Now, a brief inclusion of some important information. I have anxiety, major anxiety, It was even worse when i was younger and I always have been short.

I had gotten to the point that I was so good at this, \*thing\* that i could use it willingly. If people knew I could do this, they would put their guard up and I just, wouldn't get much. But if their guard was down. I saw straight through them. I saw all their secrets and could know whatever i wanted about them.

I thought i could use it to, make friends easier and not let my anxiety stop me as much in day to day life because with anxiety, and being short. When having normal conversations with people, i never felt equal. Because nobody else had anxiety as bad as me, nobody else was really as short as me. So if i knew stuff about them without them knowing, personal stuff. That made us equals, and because of that, i could have a conversation with them without stuttering while feeling somewhat equal.

I didn't see the problem with this until I realized how much i was doing it. I did it with every conversation. Even family members and long time friends.

Which brings us to today. Where I am constantly over analyzing everything. Oh heres a neet thing to tell you about, I love Black Mirror. However, within 10 minutes of each episode, I know how the rest of the show will go. So I sort've ruin it for myself. Anyways! I am constantly analyzing everything. What people say, what people do. How they say it, how they do it. Right down to how they walk.

I've got to admit. While it is cool to know things about people without them knowing, it seems like i'm cheating at times. For instance, if i wanted a girlfriend. Do the \*thing\*, know everything about her, and then say exactly the right things to her. Within 2 days, i could get her to think I'm special or even, start developing feelings for me. But its not all cheating, I can get free stuff by sympathizing with a worker by knowing a personal thing that they might be going through.

But its also a curse, because well the cheating life part. But also, I can't stop. I over analyze every single thing. Maybe it's because i have trust issues. Imagine going through life being able to know whatever you want about someone. Part of life's exciting moments is when you make a friend and that friendship develops and your friend tells you a secret they have. With this, nothing is left to mystery.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm missing too much of my family's life with my job. I'm in restaurant management and would absolutely love an 8-5. Anything with some stability. Rotating shifts, constantly changing schedules and staff crises, the drama of dealing with entitled customers and missing my kids growing up is finally getting to me. This is a game for young, single people and I want out. I just don't know where to turn.

&amp;#x200B;

I've got a bachelor's degree but the only salaried experience I've got is restaurant management. Extensive background in customer service and account management, so I've been looking at banks. Also got a large military base nearby so I've been looking into government contracting as well. As long as I end up making around $50k we'll be set. I make more than that now and am the only one working so it can't be much lower than that, which unfortunately removes a lot of options.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been thinking about learning a trade, particularly HVAC since there'd always be work here in the south. Trouble is for a while I'd be making less than I am now so we'd have to spend some time setting ourselves up for that before making a move. I just want to have a job where I can spend more time with my family than I do at work. If I could make a living chopping down trees or driving forklifts, I would. Just need some direction.

27,"Hello. This is my first entry. I decided to start writing as I don't have that much time to read anything long enough for it to be of any help lately, so I decided to pick up writing. I don't think this ""diary"" writing will uphold, hopefully it will. 

Today has been a very productive and yet stressful day for me. I have completed almost all of my tasks but yet again, vidya probably took around 4 hours of my day today. I would probably have completed it all if I hadn't  given up to them. I did need a break though,  that is the main reason why I played today or any other working day i have.
I don't think it's an excuse to play games as I have been playing vidya for so long, I developed self awareness and can determine whether or not it's an addiction or an activity providing me with a temporary relief. Either way, I should limit my game time and spend more time focusing on my physical health by exercising something that I really lack. It worries me, that one day, it will come out of nowhere and only then I will start taking my health seriously by taking action. I do not want to reach that stage, it is too risky and is not worth the reward unless what happens is not too bad but is enough to change my approach for the better.

Let's continue on from here-- what do I have for tomorrow I have already mapped. Ready to work tomorrow. I feel exhausted though,  I want to go somewhere and spend just enough to really carelessly enjoy the evening with someone, to provide myself a temporary relief from this stressful environment I have created for myself. I'm feeling such stress that the right side of my head feels tight and i hear constant ringing in my ears. Reading this in the future will probably have me in disbelief, how hard I have stressed myself out. This amount of stress will probably  make me forget these experiences right now which more so will add to my shock and disbelief, of the future me. 
I haven't eaten at all today,  I dont recall eating anything other than some sweet caramel crackers in the morning and the salad mom gave me. Probably the caffeine and my stress have toned down the hunger.
Speaking of mom, when will I reach a point where I'll leave the house? I'm really eager to try it out, the biggest reason is finding a woman whom I can share my life with on an intimate level I have never experienced in the 20 years I have lived on this planet. 
The last time I had anything intimate was in 6th grade when I was a much more social of a creature. 
Even though I chose the lonely cyber path I don't think I regret it, as it paid really well financial dividends that otherwise I don't know where myself and my family would be. 

I thank the unknown forces that contributed to this, unless it had I'll intentions :(

I was thinking earlier today again about this depressive state of mine. The more time passes by, the more I realize it is due to the intimate loneliness I have. I feel like shit. I don't know where to begin fixing it. I believe that I have to be that perfect partner I look for so that's one of the reasons why I exhaust myself so badly with my work,  I want to be financially stable and set. From there I should start working on my body as it is not very attractive and healthy but also not so bad. I'm confident that I have average and above looks thanks to my genetics, which I'm grateful for every passing day. Receiving compliments from third parties just reasures me even more. It sends shivers down my body just thinking how lucky I am. 

This topic of luck had jumped to my head today and I thought about it thoroughly, arriving at sad conclusions, I don't think everyone is given perfect opportunities-- not only where they are born(environment)-- but also who they are born as. It makes me feel bad for the unfortunate ones. I have taken a vow that if and when I become an individual with power, I will try creating and providing opportunities for the unfortunate ones. I think they deserve a fair chance in this world.

I hope one day to find a similar soul whom I can share all I have written here without a second thought. It will truly make me a happy person. With teary eyes though I'll have to say that I don't believe I'll ever be in that place. I don't think I'll have such a lending ear I could spill my heart and brain into, without fearing an ulterior ill motive, it has become a fantasy. The older you grow the more you learn of this world's true colors. I really do want to dream though, I just don't want it to hurt me too bad perhaps and worsen my current state? Basic survival mechanism at play is what i think. The sooner I will kill this dream, the faster and more time will I have to adapt to this reality with no such dream materializing. Is this okay or is it self sabotage? I need another opinion. This is too big of a decision to make on my own without others' take.

I do not feel old. Rather I dress in pretty young and bright styles. I am really small so I sometimes buy clothing from the children’s section of Wal Mart. I just turned 18. I’m tired of deciding to wear my glasses one day and the first thing out of peoples mouth is “Hey grandma OP” or “wow you look so old” and lots of others. People tell me I look like my 56 year old mom when I wear my glasses, which I get because we share body frames, but she doesn’t even wear glasses, and we also don’t actually look alike facially. 

My director constantly picks me for the old woman role. I’m not sure what about me evokes “old woman.” I try hard to actually avoid seeming that way because at this point I am so paranoid. Is my face just unattractive? My personality? I don’t consider myself to act too too mature. My personality is pretty lighthearted and fluffy I guess. 

I just worry a bunch, and I know I shouldn’t be concerned or care what others think, but I’m starting to hate being labeled like this. I want others to see me as who I am and how I feel about myself, not them.

Should I just tell people to stop? If they do stop, I’ll still be paranoid that nobody sees the real me. How the heck do I better express myself?

TLDR: people keep saying I look old and it’s bothering me. What do I even do?",08Mar2019,3

Then think of it is, I have these... episodes where I act completely out of character. My thought and actions are completely irrational. To put it simply. I'm either a super hyped insomniac, with a brain on overdrive, absolutely convinced that I've got my sh*t together. Or I'm so exhausted that I can't get out of bed for days, convinced my life will amount to nothing. I just can't seen to find the middle-ground.

I've tried all the herbal teas, the vitamins, the yoga, the mindfulness, but nothing's working. I don't know what the hell is wrong with me.

I guess it showed on my face because a middle aged ""country"" guy, wearing a chevy baseball hat, jeans, and a plaid shirt tucked in (literally the epitome of country), walked past me, stopped, came back towards me, looked me in the eye and said ""Smile buddy, it ain't all that bad.""  He had such a sincere smile on his face when he said that.  It made me feel so much better, that simple act of sincere empathy.

I was surprised initially, and I mumbled along the lines of ""yeah I guess not"" and gave a nervous smile.  He said ""Take it easy buddy"" and walked in the store.  I wish more people were like that.  It warms my heart and makes me so happy thinking about it hours later.  It felt so genuine and heartfelt.

This was on my first day at my first job which was as a cashier at McDonald’s, at this time I was going through a really hard depressive episode, as you can imagine on my first day I did a lot of mistakes because I literally didn’t know anything, I wasn’t feeling too good about myself and I felt like a complete failure, then I go to serve this sweet old lady coffee and she looks me in the eye and said “you’re doing great sweetie” and for once in my life I was able to feel good about myself, that comment really got to me because it was so random and she didn’t even know it was my first day.

Good because I'm grateful to have a supportive mother. I realize that some individuals on this sub have toxic relationships with their parents &amp; I have no idea how I would handle life if that was the case.

but that's about as good as it gets for me. The only person I've texted this whole spring break has been her.

Don't feel like explaining my whole life story but I am not the same person I was a year ago. In the beginning of 2018, I played video games like there was no tomorrow, smoked weed any chance I had, partied almost every weekend in my fraternity with my ""bros"", watched porn every morning/night, and dated a beautiful girl (how I managed to with my nasty habits at the time was nothing more than a miracle).

Now that it's 2019, I'm finally enjoying what I do in my major (computer engineering, I replaced my gaming addiction with enjoying the challenge of programming), finished reading my first book that wasn't related to a class, developed a passion for fitness/weight lifting, got back into skateboarding, and quit porn/smoking weed (Not here for a debate on these topics. I'll always support weed but I got consumed in it and it no longer serves me).

I am also single and talk to literally no one but one guy in that fraternity (Organization got kicked off campus. All of my friends I considered to be close were only cause of weed and video games. Once I decided I wanted more out of my life, they quickly disappeared.). I wasted all of my time during undergrad chasing short term pleasures. I lost an amazing girl and was once my greatest support system (also a big reason for my social life). Currently playing catch up and feel like I only have acquaintances in my life.

This isn't nearly as bad as some other stories on here. I just needed to vent to someone because I always feel lonely at the end of the day and find myself wishing I was still apart of my ex's life. I'd be suicidal if it weren't for reddit communities and having such a supportive mother.

42,"Popular topic I know. I myself am of direct latin descent, and at one point I used to use every racial slur in the books, when I was edgy, stupid, immature terrible 14 year old.
8 years later, I’m almost completely opposite of that jerk.

Background of Encounter:
This post is not however about me. I shared a post on FB regarding the high school teacher that supposedly had their students make a product that they could sell, the post being about
“Use the N word once without repercussion coupon card” 
something along those lines. A student found it offensive, the teacher told them to sit down and be quiet, meanwhile the white students had a laugh about it.

The Issue:
I obviously thought that was horrible. I made a specific statement of
“Satirically speaking, this would be hilarious because there are so many white people butt-hurt about not being able to use the word that they’d actually be willing to buy a racist-free card if they could. That’s not the case, so this is just terrible immature behavior.”

So I’m not condoning it, in fact I’m condemning it.

I get 2 comments from (you guessed it) two white men, both ex-military.

In order:
White Man #1 (for short WM1): 
“If that black man has no ancestral ties to slavery, then wouldn’t him saying (actually spells out N) it be as bad as a white man saying it? It’s all a sham”

My Reply:
“Personally I would prefer no racial slurs to be used at all. However, we live in no such world and if a racial slur were to be used, it should be used by the aforementioned race. Racial slurs are made specifically to suppress a minority group, whether it’s the N word, or beaner, wetback, etc, if the minority group are using it, it is because they are taking it back. I know the feeling may be lost on you as you’ve never been a minority, but please try and understand. Even I used to be in your position about the N-Word but I listened to what others had to say about it and I have read the fallacy of those who like to say they’re ‘Color-Blind’ , but it just ends up being counterproductive.”
^WM1 never replied to my comment, but did read it, just chose to ignore it and comment on other posts

WM2:
“I refused to read anything after ‘aforementioned race’ because it’s total bullshit. It’s simple, either everyone can use it or NO ONE CAN. Saying only one race can use the word perpetuates the existence of race and racism.”

Me:
“Although I 100% understand that argument, you’re speaking from a view of idealism. We don’t live in such a world, it does not exist. I personally don’t use racial slurs whatsoever, 0%. Not even gender-phobic slurs, because it’s better to be kind or just avoid those slurs, even if I as a Bi-Latino have ‘permission’ to do so, I don’t because I do believe it keeps racism alive, but I’m not going out of my way to tell other minorities what they should or shouldn’t say if it’s their own racial slur.”

WM2:
“No you 100% DO NOT understand my point of view. It’s simple, you allow everyone to use it or not at all. Allowing some to use it and not others only makes things worse, it keeps racism alive far longer than it needs to be.”

Me:
“Do not tell me that I do not understand that point of view, I 100% understand it. The fact is that your POV is idealistic, in an ideal world what you’re saying is a fact. However, we live in reality, biologically there is no race, only Clines(slight physical differentiation in outward and some internal appearances). Biologically we are all the same. YET, race absolutely exists both culturally and socially. THAT is the fact of our reality, and to use Color-Blind argument, from a white male POV to TELL minorities that they shouldn’t use a word is not progress, it is simply exerting MORE control over minorities. You speak from a place of privilege as you have never been oppressed the same way the African community and My community have been. You could try and say you’ve been called a Cracker and a Gringo, but you’ve never been at the bottom of the Majority’s heel, you’ve never faced any trials like we have. It is better to let the African Community to decide whether or not they want to use the N word, it is NOT as black and white as you wish it to be, it is NOT simple. I used to think it was, because ideally it’s how it ‘should’ be, but your POV, as good-hearted as it is, is foolishly idealistic and trivializes the years of emotional and socioeconomic damage. How? You’re ironically still telling minorities what they should and should not do or say.”

Tldr:
Friend says Everyone or No one, truly means well, but fails to recognize how a minority feels, not all but a majority.

43,"2 days ago I was playing basketball at my university’s gym &amp; a guy called a foul on me &amp; I felt like it wasn’t much of a foul so I told him he made a pussy call. 

Dude then told me I was too short to be playing basketball &amp; I just told him I’d have more points then him by the end of the game.

So 5 mins later I get the ball &amp; he’s guarding me. Instead of trying to play defense he just intentionally fouls me. Instead of being a pussy &amp; calling a foul I continue to go to the basket &amp; as I get the the basket about to shoot a layup he completely hacks me in mid air.. doesn’t even make a play on the ball &amp; I hit the ground &amp; luckily I wasn’t injured.

So I get up ready to fight. He looks at me smirks &amp; lunges at me like he’s about to throw a punch. Sadly he has no idea basketball is my second sport.. &amp; boxing is my 1st. So when he lunges I stick him right in his teeth &amp; break his front two teeth &amp; just his lip.

Needless to say we both got kicked out of the gym &amp; aren’t allowed to return. I find this a bit unfair since I only punched him in self defense since he lunged at me. 

Was I wrong for punching him in the face when he lunged towards me? You think if I have them check the cameras &amp; see what happened they’ll allow me back in to the gym? I was simply defending myself &amp; I’m trying to think if there was a better way I could have handled the situation.

Last Thursday, I was in English class and saw these weird cuts on this girl next to me's hand.

Me: ""What are those cuts on your hand?""

Her: ""Don't worry about it.""

So I minded my own business for the rest of class, but for the next couple of days I kept thinking back to that incident. I had an FRC (First Robotics Competition) meet the coming weekend. It was getting pretty late at the competition, and as I chatting with another kid, who we'll call 'N', about something else, the situation popped into my head. So the conversation went something like ""I saw cut marks blah blah I think I should report her to someone"" ""No that's a bad idea, adults don't know what they're talking about (this kid is known to be idiotic)"" ""Okay whatever"", I say.

So the competition ended for the day, and I couldn't stop thinking about it until I fell asleep in the hotel we were staying at (story for another day). The next morning, I got ready with the team clothes and went down to eat breakfast. I went and sat next to my friend, who we'll call 'D', and started chowing down. N comes over to the table we're sitting at, and after about 10 minutes of chatting, he remembers something:

""Oh, I texted *that girl* (because we were in front of others) and she actually said that she was feeling suicidal and depressed. I really didn't expect that. I'm sorry for doubting you. But I still think that you shouldn't tell an adult"". After the second half of the competition ended, I went home and forgot about the whole situation.

On Tuesday I saw her again, and I remembered the whole thing. After class ended, I went straight down to the counselor and told her all about the scars, the depression, and everything else.

I think she is getting the treatment she needs, and I feel like I did the right thing. Now when I think back to that situation, I stop and smile, because I did something good in the world.",08Mar2019,37

I made a white gravy, and thought some roasted almond pieces would be a nice touch to it. It was.

We’ve met before on another scene and have gotten to know each other a little bit. We’ve chatted at parties and stuff, but I wouldn’t say we’re friends.

I am kind of into this girl, and it seems like we have some similar interests. I’m pretty shy, so I tend to act kind of awkward around her sometimes, but she tends to as well. I crack a lot of jokes during rehearsal, and she genuinely laughs at almost every one. When I first met her, she seemed different than she does now. That could just be a response to me acting odd though. 

It’s also a little strange since we are a couple in the scene we’re doing, so we have to act like we’re dating on-stage. This was tough for me at first, but I’ve gotten past the uncomfortableness. We’re getting closer to our performance, and that means I probably won’t see her at all after. I’ve been thinking of maybe asking her out, but I feel like that tends to backfire on me. I did it to a person I’m kind of friends with in a club we’re in, and it became awkward when they said no. We’ve moved past it, but it’s mostly because we see each other a lot. That wouldn’t be the case here.

I feel like it would be *super weird* to ask her out before we’re finished with our scene, again since we’re a fake couple. I don’t know if it‘s even worth it though since the semester will be almost over. I also tend to get hung up over stupid things like rejection. Any advice?

Hello, I'm a 19 year old guy, and I need some help, I need to get this off my chest.

I have never been in a serious relationship before meeting this girl, I dated some girls during High School but nothing serious, but one day I met him, I don't know why, but since I talked to her for a few minutes, I knew, there was gonna happen something between us, we matched really nicely.So after a long time talking through the phone, we decided to go on a date. The date went fantastic and that confirmed that we were really happy with both of us together, so after 1 month meeting her every 2 days, one night, we spent from 12 AM to 5 AM laughing and watching the stars, and I kissed her. And a couple of days after, she asked me if I would like to be in a relationship with her. I said YES! And I remember that moment for being one of the most magical moments of my life.

Both of us, never had a serious relationship, even sex, in that way we were both so similar.The first year was fantastic, without arguing too much, spending a lot of time together, traveling, but since we started college, things changed.Things became different, and we were arguing a lot, most of it because of jealousy, and the most of it was her jealousabout me, without any reason because I spent all the time in his house, or studying. Here I realised that since I was with this girl, I have seen my friend only 10 times, in a whole year! At the moment I liked a lot more spending time with my girl than with my friends because I get bored every time I went out with them.

She started to get closer to his group of friend in Uni, as I did too, but their group of friends were two boys, her friend, and her. So as little as I know, her friend, who I've never liked because she was so controlling and It seems that she doesn't like me either. She started talking a lot of bullshit about me.

Her dream was to travel to París, so with all the money that I was working during the summer, I gift her a travel to París to both of us. I thought this might help our relationship.But because the problems that we were having by the time we were 1 and a half year of relationship, the fact that one of the boys of Uni was talking to her a lot and her toxic friend keep talking bad to me, and taking good of the unit boy, she breaks up with me.

It was horrible, when I went to see my friends, I cried in front of them, not because the break up, because they accepted me and didn't get upset with me after being an asshole for not spending time with them, here I realised that I have such a good friend.I have to say that we break up in a good way, as ""friends"". I decided to not talk anymore until I felt [better.One](https://better.One) month after the breakup, I saw in his social media that she was starting to get closer to that boy, and nowadays it's obvious that they are in a relationship, I couldn't hold it no more, so I blocked him from social media, and deleted his phone number.

She phoned me and I explained the reasons why I did that and she was okay with it. That was the first time we talked after the break up. Around 2 minutes of call.

From the pain I felt during the breakup I took it to join the gym, and I have discovered a new whole lifestyle that is helping a lot with my mood.

At the moment, I am trying to meet new girls, but I can't. She seems so happy, his toxic friend too, and everyone seems so happy but I am not, it still hurts a lot thinking that she is with another guy. I fear to not find love again. Should I meet new girls even I know that I will not have anything with them, in order to try to forget her?

It is really frustrating that with her I have never bored because we always have plans, and we were not, I could plan to meet my friends. But now I felt like I have a looooot of time to myself that is hard to get used to.",08Mar2019,1

My younger brother’s only two years younger than me, but we both drifted far apart when I started high school.

I’m on three monster energy drinks today and my body feels physically broken. The exam is in about 10 hours. The panic attack is starting to slow because I’m finally telling someone, something, about my deepest secret, but the ugliest feeling in world remains. God, do I really want to kill myself? The ugly, ugly truth is yes. Yes, I do. I’m just going to be another failure burnout because I make stupid decisions and act like I’m bigger than my body.

I just want to go back in time. Back before I procrastinated and didn’t take this Physics course seriously and I could get A’s like last semester. I keep rambling because this is the only way to stop my panic attack. LSD told me that I needed to cut open my thoughts and open up my head, like letting blood, but I’m just now realizing what that means. It means I have to be honest and realize that I want to kill myself. It’s what I was hiding. I thought my thorn was that people were out to hurt me, but that’s not the only thorn I have to dig out of myself. The truth is that I want to kill myself. Just like high school. Just like how my friend did. That’s why I’m fascinated with guns and keeping about being shot in the head. It’s because I want that to happen.

I’m crying and couldn’t even do that before. My heart rate is slowed, but I’m left with the ugliest feeling in world. I want to kill myself, it’s true. I know that it’s true. But I still don’t want to be hospitalized. I don’t know that to do with this information but I’m still unsure how to open up and I still don’t really want to die. I just want to be a good kid and not fail my classes or Physics. I don’t want to disappoint anyone. But I already have.

I really want someone to have read this and understand. I want attention. I want reassurance more that everything. I want people to hug me and tell me that it’s going to be okay and that they love me. I’m just left with another ugly, ugly truth about myself.

It's been more than 5 years and I'm still angry, very angry. My senior quote was from Laurie Halse Anderson's Wintergirls, a book about eating disorders. My relationship, looking back, had all the tell tale signs of the abuse I was suffering but again nobody stepped in.

I was in my guidance counselor's office at least twice a week for anxiety attacks, but nothing was ever escalated beyond just calming down and going back to class. I saw my GP monthly for auto-immune issues and nothing was said. My parents were busy, but ever present at school functions and so proud of me ""being so healthy"". I graduated high school at 80 pounds. I was close with my teachers, tutored other students, and my biggest misfortune was that most of my close friends had graduated the year before this happened or weren't around because of my partner. 

I guess I just needed to vent. I had to leave university and my scholarships to get help after multiple suicide attempts my first year and haven't been able to afford to go back yet.

Also when I only got a pub job myself without asking for her help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way.

76,"\[24M\] Before anyone jumps to conclusions from the title, **this is not a suicidal post**. I’m fortunate in that I’ve never really struggled with mental health issues. This is mostly just a reflection on my current lifestyle.

Apologies for the long post.

Recently I’ve been noticing that things maybe feel a little... off for me right now. By all accounts I feel like I should feel great about everything, but the thoughts keep creeping in:

I graduated college with the degree I wanted (graphic arts), as well as another (marketing) that I figured would go well together. Sadly my classes and many of my teachers were kind of shit though, so I didn’t feel as prepared as I could have been.

Not too long after moving from college I found a job somewhat in my field that I think is a good start. The steady paycheck, benefits, (mostly) relaxed culture, and Wednesdays off are all great! However, it’s less creative/artistic than I’d like, I’m definitely not getting paid what I deserve, and the company is making some ambitious decisions that are taking us in a direction I’m not sure I really want to go.

I live with two college friends (and two dogs!)in a house one of their dads bought! It’s pretty good size, 100+ years old, and has beautiful woodwork. Rent is kept pretty low and we’ve been updating it as we go too. It’s taking a lot of upkeep though (to be expected) and I feel I do a disproportionate amount of chores compared to my roommates. Also I feel like we’re missing a lot of things we should be doing to take care of the place since we’ve never owned a home before.

I’ve got an ok number of friends, some of which I even play D&amp;D with! Alas, we’re not able to play very frequently and when we do it’s never for super long. My two best friends can hardly ever hang out due to work and SOs, and everyone else I’d like to spend time with is either still in school or works erratic hours.

Video games have always been a great love of mine. I’ve played WoW for years, have handheld systems, PlayStations, and recently built my own gaming computer! Previously, I’ve tended to lose myself in a lot of games I play. I’m not sure if it’s just the pace of the games I’m playing now, or maybe just a bit of burnout, but I’m having a hard time keeping invested in what I’m playing now. I also can’t play as much as I’d like with my PS4 in the living room and the two roommates.

Art has always been a passion of mine, even if I’m not great at a lot of it. Printmaking, photography, and digital illustration are some favorites just to name a few. Since going through school for it I’ve been in an art block and have had trouble producing much of anything. I made \[this post\] to try and get back into printmaking, and have been making myself draw as often I can to try and get unstuck from my rut.

My parents surprised my brother and I with a trip to Hawaii in the fall, so I’ve been trying to get healthier and shed some weight before that. It’s been going pretty well so far (15 lbs in 2ish months)! Once it warms up I’m hoping to get out a bit more to run and start working out.

Currently, my love life is pretty lackluster. No dates from dating apps in the months I’ve had them. I have gone on a few dates with a girl I met at a friend’s birthday party that have been nice. It's been about a year since my last long-term relationship ended and I've been feeling a little lonely, so (TMI) &gt;!it's led to a lot of masturbation lately. I know it's natural, and fine to an extent, but it's still not the sex I'm seeking right now!&lt;.

Lastly, I've started getting a bit of wanderlust. Too bad I don't really make enough money to do much traveling, but at least my family has that trip in the fall.

These have been my thoughts lately. I'm working to improve myself and my life, and fairly happy most of the time, but these thoughts have been cropping up so I thought it would be nice to get them out a bit.",08Mar2019,6
77,"Today at a hospital rotation this man bumped into me and started talking to me. I later found out he is a surgeon prof who will be mentoring us later. I told him I am a pharmacy student and he suddenly asked me a lot of questions about some drugs and what I thought about them. I was surprised and reminded him I am a student and he encouraged me to give him the answer as ""I am the expert"".

I later came across another prof from my major and briefly mentioned how this prof asked those drug questions. She was extremely surprised and said it is unusual for a doctor to actually ask a pharmacist about drugs. She then asked if he knows I am a student and I said yes. I said he may only be testing my knowledge but my prof seems to disagree.

How can I react in these situations? I am not used to a prof asking a student like me for ""advice"" lol. Pretty sure he was joking.

79,"I’ve dealt with depression since I was in high school. It’s always come in waves. I’m now 27 and it’s just become worse and worse. (I also apparently deal with generalized anxiety disorder). The stress of a break up my cat dying and not being able to find better work has put a lot of pressure on me. 

Tuesday night was the first night I really drank anything in a while, when I got home I threw all my pills in a cup and poured myself a cup of tequila and started to have a mental breakdown. I called my ex cause he lives nearby I didn’t know who else to contact. He came over and ended up  helping me out, eventually leading to him having to call the cops.

I was sitting in the shower with a kitchen knife nearby. They dragged me naked barely throwing a towel over me and strapped me down. I wasnt acting out. On the way to hospital the paramedic wouldn’t even slightly loosen the strap that now bruised my arm.

This was the lowest point in my life. I literally just sought help a week prior with a psychiatrist and started medication. I’ll see him later this week for a checkup. Most of my pills got destroyed in the incident. But miraculously there was just enough until I go back and see my psychiatrist. My close friends and family know that I attempted suicide (again) I half heartedly tried in HS.

I just felt like sharing to a community of people that might also struggle with mental health issues. I wish it upon nobody.

I took pto until I go back Monday so I could rest. I am not looking forward to going back at all because I hate my job. And don’t just hate it like most people as in it’s contributing to a lot of my mental health issues. Again I’ve tried applying and I’ve been on many interviews over the last several months with no luck.

Trying to stay positive, went to the gym yesterday, finally ate a little bit yesterday, and plan to hit the gym later today.

I guess I just felt like sharing my story with someone in this world. I know there’s no real question being asked. I already know about all the resources available to me.

92,"I went to that psychiatry for 3 years. After my first therapist moved, I got this therapist for about a year, first every week, then when I started working every month or so. I had trouble finding the time to go to therapy, because my therapist was in a completely different city and I had very little holidays. 

So one time I texted him that sorry I won't be able to go to therapy, but please write my prescription and I will go get it at an afternoon at the hospital. (We did this once before.) One week went by, and there was no answer. I called the psychiatry, and the hospital worker told me they already sent it in the mail. Which I didn't know they could do, a text would have been nice from my therapist informing me about this. 

So two months went by and my meds are running out. I send a text to him again to please send me my prescription, and asking when can I go to therapy. No answer. My prescription came, so I know he read the text. It's been months. 

It's just weird. Even if he doesn't care, the hospital workers were always so nice with informing me if my therapist can't come to the appointment, scheduling a new one, things like that. It always seemed pretty professional. But now, it's just radio silence for months. Which I find extremely unethical. First, I was on meds. I wanted to quit anyway so that's fine, but I had to do it on my own, with no supervision. They all knew I was on meds and they didn't know I want to quit though, but they must know I had to. Second, like, wouldn't they wanna make sure that I'm okay? 

I know that all the therapists at that hospital get together once a week, discussing patients. So like, what does my therapist say about me? Someone must have asked. I had a temporary therapist once who is still at that hospital. And I was going to that hospital for 3 years every week. Like what the fuck. 

If my therapist wanted to end things, he should have discussed it with me. Or find me an other therapist at the hospital. Or tell me to find another therapist. Because now I need meds again and it's very awkward that I can't call that hospital, I am going to get an appointment at a completely different hospital to avoid embarassment for everybody.
