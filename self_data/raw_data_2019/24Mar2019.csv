0,"My grandpa suffers from dementia.

Lately it happens more and more often that he doesn't come back from a walk and gets lost for several hours. I love my grandparents and it is very hard to see how the once always good-humoured grandpa often forgets who his closest relatives are. My grandma is still trying desperately to deal with it alone and does not want to accept help from outside. 

What makes it worse is the fact that we're three hours apart. My dad has to work a lot and tries to go there as often as possible on weekends, but he doesn't always make it. He makes a very depressed impression, understandably.

My Mum and I don't know what we can do. We try to relieve him of as much work as possible. What else can we do to make this time a little easier for my dad?

To distract myself from this shitty situation I often stay longer at work and sit more often at the computer and play games with friends.

Just the thought that I'm standing in front of my grandpa and he doesn't recognize me kills me. Apart from the fact that he has to leave us sometime. I don't know what I can do, my grandmother and dad suffer so much from it and I don't want to burden them with the fact that it's a very hard time for me as well.

I'm so clueless and sad right now.

1,"I love communication, so language is a pretty huge part of me. I want to be a translator when I am older. I end up learning a language to have conversations but not enough to be fluent. You need to be fluent if you wanna be a translator, so I have set a goal to learn Dutch in 31 days a full month starting tomorrow spending an average of 2-3 hours a day, by the end of the month if I am fluent and can have full conversations with my friend who is Dutch I will buy myself ben and jerrys Ice cream since I love it. After Dutch i will work on being fluent in Swedish as I already know a lot. Then Polish since one of my best friends is Polish. After those languages Norwegian because its very similar to Swedish then Afrikaans and Flemish since its very close to Dutch and only has slight differences just like American English and British English. I have some fears with forgetting fluency in a language after a while so I plan to learn languages I can use with friends first.

3,"I am 15 as of last feburary. I have a great girlfriend and mom and siblings and friends. BUT I just can't get outta this situation of being constantly depression and in fight or flight mode. I don't know why I am this way other than my diagnosis of G.A.D and Clinical depression.

I basically just got dumped. And I know it wasn't gonna last but it still sucks. I can't keep friends. Everyone is rushing me to go back to school but when I try I can't move and start curling into a ball and crying. 

I am feeling sorry for myself and I'm sure it could be worse but fuck im so tired of this feeling. I just wanna have it go away. I would NEVER off myself. I enjoy life when it's not overwhelming but it's getting to be so much. I don't know what to do. 

Games don't bring any happiness to me, my mom is barely keeping our house afloat sometimes. It's too much for me sometimes I just wanna be happy and enjoy life. I miss school and I never thought I'd say this but God I miss all my classes.

I'm not me anymore I'm a shell if the person I was. A waste of space. I'm failing of course after missing 2 months of school and I can't sleep even now after 24 hours being up straight I'm still wide awake.

This is just a ramble so I'm sorry it's all fucked up. I hope you whoever is reading this has a great day and life.

4,"I haven’t self harmed in a year. Lately I’ve been wanting to relapse. I have nothing but deep rooted hatred for myself. It shows in the way I walk, talk, act, etc etc. if I don’t do something to improve my mental state now then I can’t go on. This isn’t a suicide note and I most likely won’t self harm but the urges have been heavy. My therapist hasn’t been helping. Every time I go in there she gets distracted by something I say and we go on tangents. Next thing I know, an hour has passed and it’s time time to schedule the next appointment.

I can’t blame her entirely, I really need to put my foot down and take charge of my sessions. I need to put my foot down for a lot of shit in my life. I really need to take a step back from social media but i can’t take it. I really can’t take it.

6,"Currently I’m a college student who has has a disorderly relationship with food since 6th grade. I remember hitting 100 pounds for the first time in 8th grade and realizing that was the skinniest id ever be again, and deciding to lose weight my freshman year of high school. This was mostly due to my own self image, but there was undoubtedly pressure from my mother who always reminded me that she only weighed 103 pounds throughout high school. The comments from her on how big I was getting (5’4 and 140 pounds) finally pushed my to change.

This was now over 4 years ago and I’m not entirely sure how I lost the weight back then, all I remember is skipping breakfast and portioning out my 10 allotted almonds for lunch everyday. I got down to 115 pounds and I was overjoyed, but within two years I had gained that weight back and then some. About a year ago I started taking laxatives right after eating so that I felt skinnier even though it never resulted in real weight loss. Last week I weighed in at 148.6. My clothes aren’t fitting the way they used to and my self-esteem is so incredibly low. I’ve gone to the gym almost everyday since and haven’t eaten more than 800 calories daily.

Today I weigh 150. I’ve lost hope. Part of me wants to push harder but I also want to binge all the foods I haven’t been eating this past week and just give up on the whole thing. The problem is I’m just not happy living this way. I feel weak, fat, and no matter how many times my lovely boyfriend tells me otherwise I have my mom’s voice in my head telling me how big I’ve gotten over the years. My friends send me pictures of my junior year self, telling me how skinny I looked back then. I cry thinking about how I can never get back to that and it makes me want to give up on everything. 

I’ve never had the healthiest relationship with food, but I’ve never felt more unhealthy than I do right now. I have no one to blame but myself and as of today I don’t feel like trying anymore.

TL;DR: My weight has been steadily increasing the past four years. Today I weigh the heaviest I ever have, and rather than seeking change I feel like giving up.",24Mar2019,3

I’ve basically engraved “fake it till you make it” in my life. I’ve struggled with anger when I was younger it was bad I rebelled on my parents ditched classes, was failing. Then I lost a church friend and I realized death is real and I don’t wanna not take advantage of things so I got better started volunteering stopped dating bad boys became a happy preppy person. Now I’m married and I love him so much but I can’t help to think he deserves better sometimes. I recently had real bad pain (cramps) we went grocery shopping and he was looking for tape couldn’t decide between two he was holding I told him to hurry up I wanted to go home well he was holding his phone and tape and I slammed the tape and said just take that one. Well he dropped his phone and it cracked. He wasn’t even upset at me he was like aw man. And then said oh well. But idk that wasn’t my intentions to crack his phone but a part of me wanted to have him yell at me or something? I don’t know what I wanted really... but now we’re trying to get him a replacement and it’s like $400 to pay off the phone and idk how much more for the new phone and if I simply hadn’t let the anger get the best of me we wouldn’t even be in this situation. I’m thinking I need a therapist.. my family thinks I’m crazy for even thinking I need one but I had one in high school sometimes talking to someone just helps.

8,"I'm 24, white, British, financially stable, perceived as male etc. Essentially the most privileged demographic that exists. I've had a good education and I perform well academically. I have hobbies (illustration and cycling) which I do multiple times each week. I am at university and currently on a well-paid placement with my dream job (as an interior/graphic designer) with the prospect of this opening doors for me in the future. My family are fairly supportive and I have a good group of friends. On paper, my life is going great.

I don't know when it started but I know the first time I tried to kill myself was when I was 12. And then another 4 times up to the age of 18. And twice more up to 22. I've been through counseling so many times with different people with different approaches and I've been on and off several different medications for anxiety and depression. I know that my brain dysfunction is chemical and my relentless invasive thoughts of self-injury, destructive behaviour or extreme things that really scare me when my brain forces them on me - it's all a disorder. I know this and I '*need help*' or whatever but knowing that isn't helping and the *help* isn't helping and having all parts of my life line up in a way that I know will probably not ever be better than it is now, isn't helping. My mood is so variable, I swing from total apathy to aggressive suicidal impulse. There's even a part of me that really resents my family for making it impractical to end my life.

I caught myself making plans to die the other day, and another time I ended up researching different methods. I don't know. It's weird. I know it's weird. Trying to explain it to people when I'm not feeling that way is almost impossible as if there's a mental block like I'm trying to explain how a totally different person is feeling? I'm just really tired of feeling so fundamentally defective. Yes, I will get better, but then I'll get worse again. And it could be anything that triggers me going from bubbly and fun to hospitalised, maybe someone leaves me on *read* or it's overcast for too long, or I have a deadline. I absolutely feel like a leaf in a storm.

9,"So I don’t know what to do, I’ve put this decision off for well over a year but now it’s time for me to settle it once and for all. 

I have two roads I can take for my future one it to go back to college, get a formal degree in history and teaching credentials and teach. To be honest this is my dream, I’ve wanted to be a teacher since I was in high school myself. I doubted myself quite a bit, and stuck with the safe route (my boring retail job). The pay is decent I guess but I feel so unfulfilled. I hate waking up and going to work I have already made the decision to leave. 

But my other route is to join a tradesman union, I have a friend who can help me get in. The money is great, the job security and benefits make it such an attractive choice. And I’ll be honest I wouldn’t hate it. In fact I really like the idea of it. I like the idea of working construction. But it isn’t my dream, teaching is my dream. 

Both would involve going to school, the tradesman union will pay for my schooling while also guaranteeing me work. While I would have to pay for my own schooling if I went for the teaching job. I am 28 and want to settle down and start a family, I want to have a solid plan before though.

I just feel so disgusting for even being in a relationship, as I made it a goal to never do such a thing for I'd say the majority of my life. It's been nearly a year since we separated and I still feel disgusted and disconnected with myself. I've humiliated myself emotionally and mentally. I'm so sick of this, but I feel like I deserve to feel this bad, since I foresaw all of the negatives and still went ahead because I'm always wrong, ironically. I just feel so embarrassed that it happened. Since transferring schools, I cut myself off from all of my (3) friends and deleted all (1) social media. I didn't want to bother them anymore. I know a relationship won't happen again, but is it normal to still feel this ashamed? Should I try to reaching out to my friends again? Why or how do I not feel closure?

16,"I just turned 18, and I decided to do something really stupid. I decided that I was going to go on grindr and maybe make a friend. It did not end up like that. I ended hooking up with some random person I met on there, and it got messy.

 I said I was going for a walk, and I went to his car, and we had sex, basically. It was incredibly stupid. When I got home, I lied and said that I had just gone on a walk. My mom smelled smoke in my clothes and got extremely angry. She even went as far as to say that maybe I had never actually gone to my friends before. Even worse is that some of my relatives are here, and they witnessed the scene.

Late I made it worse by confronting my mom about some of the things she said about to my aunt when I was in the shower, which I heard. They were pretty vile things that she said, and cried about it. My mother denied saying the things that she said when I confronted her about it, and there was an even worse scene for my aunt and cousin. 

I don't know what to do.

I don't necessarily feel bad about having the sex, because sex isn't a bad thing, but I do feel bad that I had to lie and make my mother angry to say those things about me.

Me and my fiance went to see a concert today (Soen, for those interested) and one of the things I really wanted, was the vinyl of the band's latest album. So, after the show I got the vinyl and I see the band hanging out in the lobby. I approached them all by myself (normally I'd have my fiance handle the social situations and I would awkwardly hide behind him) and had some nice conversations with them all and took some pictures with them. I was so nervous, it kinda glitched my ability to speak English properly (not my first language, although I speak it fluently). But it turned out fine! I went home with a brand new record with 5 autographs on it and some new favourite memories. 

I also approached the band that played support. Again, not my typical behaviour. Told them they played an awesome gig and talked to them a bit.

Here's the kick: we're nearing our first anniversary, we both love each other deeply, but he's insane about his political opinions. He thinks, as a gay man, that our president, who publicly acclaimed Pinochet and Ultra, who said he'd rather have a dead son than a gay one, is actually protecting his interests.

He's more religious than I am (Catholic). There's a young priest here preaching acceptance, tolerance, openness. My boyfriend told me he hates him because he was ironic while tweeting.

I feel like he's taking hints from people convicted of hating him, but prefers to hate those who defend the comfort he doesn't even realize he has.

32,"So, one year. I'm proud! It feels good and life, in general, has been much better without alcohol or drugs.

I didn't really want to celebrate, though, because the story behind my sobriety is pretty dark. I got sober because I was in a really terrible freak accident when I was drunk and ended up losing half my legs. (Yep.) Not a lot of people irl know how drunk I was when it happened and a big part of me still blames myself for the accident, even though it was no one person's fault – truly a *freak* accident. Still, I have a hard time forgiving myself.

It ended up being kind of a frustrating day. The heat and hot water in our building is off so it's frickin freezing in here; one roommate is on a trip and the other left earlier to stay at a friend's house because it's so cold. The only time I left the house was to buy some Juul pods (lol). Had way too much coffee. Guess that addictive personality is still there.

I ended up spending the whole day wired as shit, posting on Reddit and listening to the same three songs over and over again. It's midnight here now and I'm honestly not sure what time I'll get to sleep because of the caffeine. On top of that – this is petty, but whatever – I have an unrequited crush that won't go away, so I've been feeling pretty bad about that.

In the end, though, I'm still glad I stuck with sobriety for this long. The days aren't perfect but they're better without waking up after a night of wine and coke and feeling awful about myself.

47,"There’s this old parable in the Buddhist community about Gautama siddhartha. It’s said that when the Buddha finally reached nirvana, or heaven, or whatever you want to call it, he walked up to the gatekeeper and the gatekeeper said, “Come on Gautama, it’s time for you to come inside now”. Upon hearing these words, the Buddha turned around and looked down upon the earth, and saw all the suffering, and disease, and violence and war that human beings inflict upon themselves and each other. He turned to the gatekeeper and said, “But what about them?” And the gatekeeper replies, “It’s not their time yet”. And so the Buddha refuses to go inside and sits down at the foot of the gates of heaven, and tells him “I won’t enter nirvana until every single last human being has gone inside.” 

And I’ve found in my own life that this becomes more and more true. The happier I become, and the more deeply I love, the more my heart hurts also. Except it doesn’t hurt over my personal problems or sufferings. It’s because the more I open my heart to receive all the good that life has to offer the more sensitive I become to the ugliness also. But that’s the ultimate heartbreak, that you’ll never get over, because no matter what you do and how hard you try, you can’t give another human being lasting happiness the way you can a Christmas gift. Wouldn’t that be wonderful? To have it all gift wrapped with a beautiful bow, and you could say to them, “Here, I’m giving you happiness. I’m giving you lasting peace. I’m settling the quarrel you have with yourself every day”. That’s their own journey. And the more deeply you love, the more you taste the bitterness with the sweet. All true love sheds a tear.

48,"I’ve always been an optimistic person. When I was young I watched my parents do and say horrible shit all the time. I had a shitty childhood from things they did as well. I decided I wanted to be a good person at roughly age 11/12 even tho I always felt like the bad guy.  

I didn’t know how to go about becoming a good person so I decided I would try not to be a bar person. Now what does a bad person consists of? I had no clue. So I looked around for the worst people I knew and look how lucky I am for it to have been my mother. I had the exact opposite of a role model. Someone who I could try not to be like.  I literally learnt how to treat people by doing the exact opposite of what my mother did. Now little did I know how much this type of thinking would actually affect my life.  

As I grew up I figured more and more things out. It was kind of hard to be a good person when your whole family was negative and hateful. I hate to admit but I kept a lot of that with me growing up and might even have a lot of that negative energy in me now.  High school was a tough time for me and every other kid I assume. The insecurities I had. The fear I had of being different. It crippled me. Social conformity is a bitch. I became just like everyone else and did my best to try and fit in. I limited myself so I could be liked. 

Out of high school I became a very positive person. I created goals and started to question things a lot more.  I was finally feeling happy and fulfilled.  I created things and I didn’t feel the need to be liked.  I could visualize the future. My future. I traveled and found even more of myself even with other people’s disapproval.  I loved myself. 

Then, things started to change. Interestingly I guess I got hit with a big dose of reality. Nothing feels the same. I guess I got hit with the same reality everyone else sees. I work s crappy job and have trouble even pushing myself to go to class to learn at Someone else’s pace. The motivation to make things happen is gone. I feel as if my dreams are fading away. I feel overwhelmed? I used to love this feeling actually and I used to say nothing could happen that could stop me in my tracks.  But Ive basically stopped and decided to lay down on the tracks. Is this what being sad feels like? Lol.  

Future? I know I’ll be back to where I was. I’ve never been ok with not being the best. My ambition will come back soon hopefully. I know I’ll get to where I’m heading.  The only thing I don’t know is how long this feeling lasts.

62,"I got him from an adoption drive for a local shelter when I was 13. He was the runt of the litter. So tiny, he could fit in your palm. His claws couldn't retract and they would get stuck in the carpet, so he would face plant multiple times a day. He had ear mites, fleas, a stomach virus, you name it. But when the vet said he was only four weeks old, we did the math and realized he had to have born within days of my birthday. So I decided we would share it.


But he got older and more mischievous. Always getting into things. Always being sassy when scolded for it. But no matter how much shit everyone else gave him, he always came when I called his name, and he always made sure that he curled up in bed with me when I went to sleep at night.


When he was 6, he met the man who would become my husband. A man who never told me he hated cats despite my very vocal love for them. A man who is certain mine was the only one he could ever like, much less love. When I would have rough days at work, he would send me pictures if them cuddling on the couch together.

We were 4 hours away, visiting a friend. I had asked my mom to keep an eye on him, that he was being more reclusive than usual. I called her around 4:30 Friday to ask a question and she found him laying in his litter box. She bundled him up in a blanket we had cuddled up together in a thousand times and took him upstairs. My husband and I packed our things and left. I called my friend, a paramedic, and she came to see if there was anything she could do, but all that was left was to make him comfortable. An hour later, he was gone.


He was going to turn 17 in August. I've spent more of my life with him than without. Raised by an emotionally absent mother and a physically absent father and with few friends (none of which I felt close to), he was all I ever felt I had. The only source of genuine love in my life for all the growing pains of my teenage years. And now he's gone.


I haven't slept well for either of these two nights since. I toss and turn and wake up over and over, and I always think of him immediately when I do. How I should have been with him. I shouldn't have left. Even though I know it wouldn't have changed anything, somehow I'm so certain it would have. And I know it will stop hurting. I'll stop waiting for him to meow for breakfast or hear the jingling of his collar as he comes over to hop up with me on the couch. But right now it just hurts so fucking much.


I had him cremated with the blanket. I regret it a little since it had so many memories with him. It feels like I gave so many away by burning it.


We pick up his ashes on Monday.

 It feels weird to be writing this with no emotion. It’s not that I don’t have emotion about my depression, or feel sad that I have thoughts of suicide… Of course it makes me feel a deep aching sadness.. usually. But my new medication is definitely doing something. My mind is different now that I’m on this higher dose antidepressant. It’s almost as if my more difficult emotions, thoughts of suicide and depression have been pushed to the back of my mind and now I’m just… Feeling odd. I feel happiness, and love, and laughter, but I don’t really feel stress, sadness or depression. But here I am writing this. This is a journal I’ve been meaning to start to document my suicidal and depressed thoughts so that if I do ever kill myself, S**** and whoever else gives a shit can look back on this and find some kind of comfort in understanding because it seems like when someone you love kills themselves, asking yourself ‘Why?’ seems to be the hardest part aside from missing them. So if I’m not feeling those difficult emotions, why am I starting this journal? Why now? Maybe this medication is what I need to just be an automaton and power through this existence until I am at an age where people find it more reasonable to off myself? I love my time with S****. But life is just one big fucking disaster after another. You just work and work and work just to get more and more debt. I’m working 6 days per week, doing better than I ever have and each year our debt grows. We’re in the red and literally can’t work any harder. The IRS and Oregon State tax debt grows by thousands and thousands each year. And what’s the alternative? Me going back on disability? Then we’d never have enough money to support ourselves, and zero chance at paying current debts off. My medical debt, the dental work I need, the tax debt, my breakdowns, my fatness…even with all of that he loves me. He loves me. He loves me so much I can see it when he looks at me and I can feel it when he cuddles me and I could go on and on about how we have something so special, but I know he feels like I don’t think it’s good enough when I’m so deeply depressed. It makes him sad that love isn’t enough. I think it makes him sad. I hope not. But he understands that I’m mentally ill. He gets it. And his amazing love for me, and his genuine acceptance makes me feel so deeply guilty when I want to die. His love for me is so beautiful that it should just fix me right? If only it were that easy. I’m glad I’m on this medication. At least I am functioning. At least I’ve been more pleasant to be around. But that voice, or feeling that’s always been in my head telling me that it just isn’t worth it is still there, it’s just not making me cry anymore. The meds are making me emotionally detached from the fact that every day, and everything is pointless outside of the love we have for eachother. His arms are my only happy place. I hate being here, and I have since I was 14. 20 years with these thoughts is a long time. It’s hard to imaging going and going and going until I’m an old woman. I just don’t want that.

We’re in good terms. We still see each other and all of that. 

I’m sure there’s another man in her life. I know her and I can tell this from her behavior and many other things.

She’s doesn’t talk about that with me. She doesn’t share with me what she’s thinking and what she’s feeling. This is a pointless relationship for me.

If she was my friend, she’d tell me everything about it, but since we were together she’s not sharing this with me. 

I think that, if she wants me in her life, she needs to be completely open about herself. And because we were together, she can be even more open with me than with a simple friend, because we’ve a more intimate relationship.

Do you understand where I’m coming from?

Let’s put it this way: she doesn’t have to talk about her life with me, if she doesn’t want to.

At the same time, if she doesn’t want to share her life with me, we shouldn’t see each other.

That’s my all point. I don’t want to force her into anything, I just want to tell her that I need honesty if we want to keep this relationship together. If she doesn’t feel like it, it’s better if we don’t see each other.

Am I being reasonable enough here? Also, how do I approach this conversation with her?

I believe she might be afraid of my reaction (even though she knows I’m a really calm person) or maybe she wants to keep me as a 2nd choice if things don’t work out with this other guy (who knows).

I think it's safe to say that this year is already the worst I have dealt with in the 17 years of my life. My grand mother died in the beginning of February and my grandfather died on 20th March. I could not meet with either of them before they left me. I thought I was dealing with these situations very maturely but I was just suppressing them all. I miss them, I know they had to go but it feels so empty without them. I wish I had a chance to sit with them one last time and tell them how much I love them. The worst part is I was intentionally being distant because I had exams for my 12th standard this March. I had high hopes from myself and wanted to put all my efforts into them so I avoided talking a lot with friends and family. I thought that 2019 will be a new beginning where everything would change. Things have changed but only for the worse. The exams went terrible not because of the things in my family life but because my preparation was shit. 

Amidst all these things, grandparents dying and my academic ambitions fading, I tried to maintain my strength until today. I forgot about everything that used to happen in my life before these incidents. My parents used to fight sometimes, physically,verbally, throwing and breaking things. I think they love each other but I'm not sure. They haven't fought for a while. However, just now they got into a arguement which could have escalated but mom knew dad was not very stable due to my granddad's death so it stopped in about 5 mins. This wouldn't have normally happen but it brought back a lot of bad memories. My grandfather and I would control them before but what would happen when I would move out for college? 

It brought back a lot of bad memories. I always had to deal with many personal issues with my confidence,friends,looks etc which seems to have resurfaced. Every terrible thing that could have happened to me has already happened and we are not even 3 months in. Everything is so new to me, I don't even understand how these days are passing. 

I will be starting college after 3 months and I had planned out how those 3 months would look like, hanging out with friends, playing football, learning how to play music etc but none of those things will happen now. I don't know what's the system in the US, but the college I was aiming for required only your percentage in 12th ,but now I will have to prepare for entrance exams for other colleges. I would probably have to move cities and I am determined to prepare well and crack all those exams but I was determined to get a good percent as well but that didn't happen. I have never doubted myself so much. Never felt so useless and lonely. 

I only want one thing right now, to escape for a bit. Not think about anything regarding my life. I don't want to go back in time and change things, I want to move forward but I have no idea how to. ",24Mar2019,1
86,"I'm a total screw up. Today, I lost my mom's debit card with about $20000 balance. While I know she can get a replacement, she called me an irresponsible screw up(she didn't say it but she spoke like she wanted to).

88,"This is a bit lengthy, and I'm not even sure what I'm hoping to gain by posting this. Maybe insight, or hope for the future.

I have numerous mental disorders (5 separate diagnoses) and physical syndromes (1 officially diagnosed, the other unofficially through a geneticist who said it's very likely). The physical issues, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and POTS, come with a shit ton of obnoxious symptoms that just hit me at random sometimes, causing me to become very confused, disoriented, and weak and eventually pass out if I don't sit or lay down right away. I struggle constantly with brain fog, and my memory fails me consistently throughout the day, every day.

I deal with nausea so much that I check for the nearest bathroom or trash can of every place I go. I cannot be standing in place longer than 20 minutes or all the above symptoms start and quickly worsen. I am becoming afraid of leaving my home, because I can't be sure when these symptoms might get too overwhelming, on top of my GAD and social anxiety. Not every situation involves a chair I can sit if I feel myself weakening.

I'm always tired, part because I can't sleep more than 2-4 hours at a time on my own, and typically only about 2 hours at a time when my fiance isn't with me. PTSD has been triggered bad recently and I've had tons of stress dreams and nightmares for about two weeks now. I'm also tired because fatigue is another symptom I struggle with, and honestly can't seem to go longer than 10 hours without napping. 

I have daily medication for the physical issues, and anxiety meds to take as needed. The anxiety meds can only be taken in certain scenarios, certain times of day, because they are the one thing that will make me sleep for 8 straight hours, but I can't wake up, so it becomes about 12 hours.

I am not optimistic for my future. I know it's only going to get worse with age. I'm now 31, and all of my issues are really starting to discourage me. To be honest, I can't recall a time after puberty that I wasn't indifferent to living. At 17 I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder after my first attempt on my life. I halfway attempted again about 3 years ago, but stopped when I reconsidered the fact that my then roommate's children would possibly see my body get taken away.

I just... don't care to live very long. I did feel better about life after leaving my emotionally abusive ex husband and moving away with the most amazing man I've ever met in my life. My fiance is the single most positive influence in my life I've ever known. He's helped me grow and learn to respect myself more than I ever have before. Experiencing life with him is the only reason I really carry on now. 

Lately, things have been rough with our living situation, my physical health, and both of us having mental health issues. Our relationship is beautiful, terrific communication, much affection, there's no problems there, but we often discuss how badly we each need therapy and psychiatrists for meds. We just cannot seem to get ahead financially to be able to do it.

We do have a plan in motion to get better housing in about 6 weeks, and by then he'll be making better money. After that, things do have the potential to get much easier.

But here's the problem: I still don't personally care if I live or die. I have dear friends and family (most of which live over 1,000 miles away) who I know love me and want me alive. I know my fiance enjoys me being alive, and I have three 10 year old animals that would definitely notice my absence. For all of them, mostly my fiance and animals, I carry on.

My health makes me worry though. At this rate, I will be unable to continue working a full time job one day, even part time will be too much. Not this year, but I feel within 10 years I will be much less capable of being on my feet at all. I DO NOT WANT TO BURDEN MY FIANCE. He has told me many times he will gladly take care of me and be the source of income. I feel this is an awful future ahead for him, and worry about if anything were to ever happen to him. 

I have been thinking about this more and more frequently. I love and trust him with every ounce of my being, but how can I expect him to have his best life with me tying him down? Is that really fair? I can barely be active as it is, I try very hard to do everything to be the best partner for him, but I feel I am doomed to fail him in the future, and by then he'll be trapped in a life built with me.


I don't enjoy living with my brain or trapped in this body. It's fucking miserable. I don't want to weigh my fiance down with taking care of me, and eventually being the only physically capable one in our marriage. I don't want to hurt my loved ones, but am I really expected to want to live this way? Am I robbing my soulmate of a better future by continuing to live?",24Mar2019,3

90,"I worked at a youth residential treatment facility for a year. I was a floor staff, which meant I was not a therapist but someone who sat with the kids while they did various activities and did rounds of supervision, and just made sure they were all accounted for and being safe. I met one resident there when I was put on his unit for the last two months of his stay. He was 17 and I was 23. We got along well and he was respectful, good kid. He left soon afterwards. After I stopped working there we kept in touch so I could see how he was doing and help him if he needed. We started talking more, and I think I’ve developed feelings for him. He is 18 and I am 24. He’s been out of treatment for about a year and a half. I know it’s absolutely unethical for a therapist to date a client— is this a similar situation in ethical taboos?",24Mar2019,2

If you are so confident, let us agree the victors will watch the losers run across the quad at midnight...naked as the day they were born, exposed as the fools they are, literally and figuratively, for all to gaze upon!""""

The other, a 33 year old male nerd with a surprisingly cute, round ""bubble butt"" jiggling behind him to our epic delight.

A 44 year old female, in surprisingly good shape actually eccept for a pudgy slight belly she'sbeen hiding under her pantsuits, holding her big breasts like they were precious jewels.

And finally our freshest face, a 27 year old geek girl with a short haircut and a nearly flat chest.

All were confident. All were stripped and sent running bare.

93,"Hey I’m still fairly new to Reddit so please be understanding. So some background information about me is I’m a 15 year old African American male and a Freshman in HS . So my first period class is made up of sophomore students and 3 freshmen one of whom is me( the class is Spanish 2 for those who are wondering) so this girl is a sophomore and we talk but not like flirty talk but like friends. This has been going on for months and we now have 42 days of school left and I recently just move to the next city over(10mins away).......uh oh. because my parents don’t want to drive me to school every morning which means next year new school. So when she found this out she confessed that she likes me. Now I’m a introverted person and I rather be at home all day singing, dancing and playing online without physical company. So I told her she knows my situation with the schools and stuff. She said we can always met up and go do things like go to the mall or movies. Remember what I said about being an introvert.....yeah no. I told her that I had some (very little tho) feelings for her but I’m not gonna date her knowing the relationship would end. Then she tried convincing me to date her for the time we had left. Still I stand by my answer. I’m not a very fast typer bc of my big hands. That info normally wouldn’t matter but she said anytime I leave her on open (forgot to mention that all of this happened on SnapChat) she would SS. So if I took to long to reply she would tell me “Answer boy” with a 😂 and SS. I told her that if I stay at current school next year I would date her. That’s when she started to act friendly again. I asked her ex ( which is also a freshman and is one of my good friends) he said don’t date her she is emotionally abusive. I asked some other friends and they said she’s manipulative. So at this point I’ve lost all feelings for this chick. And for the past two days she’s been blowing up my phone. But she’ll reply with stuff like”yeah ,lol, right” and says things like “oh leaving me on open” how the hell do you respond to those dry ass answers!!!!

95,"After struggling with self worth and confidence I've come to realize that the major root of my problem is that I base it off of other people.  How many people like me, how many people contact me and how people treat me. 

After getting in a huge argument with my husband last night because instead of telling him I wanted to go do something together I dropped hints and waited for him to tell me he wanted to spend time with me. When he didn't, I became a total mess and equated it to him not caring about me. 

It snowballed from there and I started talking about how none of my friends contact me - its always me reaching out. How I don't have really good friends from years ago because I feel as though I'm continually crapped on. 

In my younger years (middle, highschool) I had a really hard time fitting in. I would get made fun of a lot.  I would find ""friends"" and then they'd be immature kids and do something mean or nasty to me. 

I'm tired of being in this spot and I'm ready to take control of my own happiness &amp; self worth without relying on other people.  I'd love to hear any advice you're willing to give.

The fact that I am kinda rusty lately since I don't play as much as I used to adds to that problem. When I play something story based, like Yakuza or RDR1 though I start getting bored by it since it's not challenging enough, and I basically just want to see the story! As soon as I play some slightly difficult singleplayer game problem number one comes into effect again. The only thing I can really play lately is Smash Bros with IRL friends.

I play a lot of different things usually. Maybe I should just stick to a single thing, and be somewhat decent at it. I can obviously not deal with being mediocre.... But just playing Rocket League and nothing else would probably drive me nuts after some time and I'd get majorly burned out by it.

105," 

Just a little context here, I graduated high school a few years back and I knew the girl I fell in love with throughout the whole 4 years.

I started out as a really shy, nerdy boy who kept to himself for the most part. I hated putting myself out there because my biggest fear has always been rejection. Because of this, I have limited friends and I still struggle with this to this day. I had this girl in most of my classes and always admired how pretty she was from afar. As cliche as this sounds, her eyes were as blue as the sky and it was quite easy to fall in a trance with them. I didn't want to approach her without getting the chance to know her first but that would soon change.

I had the chance to work with her on a few partner assignments that required us meeting at various places such as the library. In there we spent time exchanging information about ourselves. She would tell me about her friends, her interests, what music she would like, theories that captured her attention and I too would do the same. Our connection was strong but I was still scared to ask her out on a date. I didn't want to sever the connection that we had, so I kept to myself about it. I watched her go through some relationships in high school, often times she would end up hurt and I would comfort her. We shared everything together, from secrets to lunches. People thought we were a couple at one point because of the insane amount of time we spent together but we were just two really good friends with a bond that was inseparable. At one point she made it clear she liked me and I didn't know how to react. I am usually the type of person to experience more misfortune than I am to see good fortune itself. I let her know that I liked her as well but I felt she may have perceived my version of like as something else. I didn't know how to express my emotions for her because here she was: a girl I had a crush on for nearly 3 years of high school, suddenly showing her attraction towards me as well. Of course I had a number of emotions surging through me, mostly excitement. I couldn't believe it *somebody loved me*. I no longer felt like an unlovable mistake, I felt wanted and alive. However, things would begin to shift for the worst and the love I thought I have won over would soon just be apart of my imagination.

She didn't believe I felt the same way about her due to failing to express my emotions towards her. We began to talk on and off throughout the following months of senior year. Nothing ever happened, we never went on a date and we stopped working together for groups. We soon began to pass each other in the hallways without saying hello or sharing lunches anymore. We started to pass in silence and the feelings we once shared with each other began to fade. Except I still held onto mine. I still hold onto those little moments of happiness we both shared, I still wanted to be apart of her life but instead I watched her walk away. Soon after graduating high school she ended up moving to go to college. I sent her a message at new years trying to start some small talk but that faded as well. I decided to remain in her past with the city she left behind. So I come here at 1:22 a.m to get this off my chest because the whole time I thought I was falling in love, I was watching my love walk away from me. Please don't make the same mistake I did. If you find someone you love, hold onto them, tell them you care for them, express your feelings for them because we only have a singular life to live. Make it your best ",24Mar2019,1

im at a community college right now and I KNOW you're not supposed to relate yourself to people on social media. Usually I'm pretty good about that. But sometimes shit gets to my head yknow? Like all my buddies are out partying and shit, fucking tons of chicks and I'm here in my bedroom on a sunday afternoon about to go deliver some postmates to get some side cash. I have pretty good grades (fantastic compared to a lot of people I'm gonna guess) and I'm planning on transferring to a top 30 university HOPEFULLY by sophomore year but knowing my luck I'll get rejected and have to spend an extra year here.

It feels like I'm just wasting away and not doing shit with my life. Like I've got a pretty decent finance internship lined up for the summer, I just need to follow up with the guy this week and I should be good. Like I said I have pretty good grades, I'm in decent shape, I'm relatively good looking, I have decent friends right now, but nothing is SPECTACULAR. 

I feel like I don't have a lot to look forward to, yknow? Like everything in my life is DECENT. I fucked up whatever I had with this super hot chick in my class somehow, she was super into me but idk what I said or did (or what I didn't do) and that was my first chance to get laid in a WHILE lmao. Fuck. 

I don't regret community college. I probably would've flunked out of my state uni if I went because I would've been too distracted with having fun, but holy fuck am I bored here.

These cows (cattle?) have been on that corner loving each other the past several months, and as of two days ago, they were gone. I was shocked when I looked over and saw a bunch of babies. (I literally slammed my breaks) Those cows grew up there to become adults, and went through a terrible winter, all to have their life ended at the beginning of slightly warm weather. New babies get to experience the warm, but those adults deserved a nice season before becoming a meal...it just broke my heart. I've lived in this rural town since I was born (19yrs ago) and still cry when i see cows.. I just wish they had another month...I'm a big baby and while I dont intend on trying to force people to stop slaughtering their cows and pigs, I wish they'd give them a quality life until the end, at least.

117,"It feels like I’m broken beyond repair. I’m such an emotionally needy person, it’s like I need someone to be there for me every second of every day. I’m constantly wanting to tell people my problems and expecting them to be able to fix me, to make me better, to make me happy

I try to be kind. I try to be helpful. I try to make others happy and be generous with my friends and family, yet I constantly think they hate me. My friends, my parents, my siblings, strangers who have just met me, my best friend of 5 years who has been there for me through the toughest moments of my life.  I often think they all hate me and no one cares about me. I say something and they give an unenthusiastic response, they hate me. I send someone a text and they don’t read it for hours, they must hate me. 

I guess I’m used to be hated. My only friends in primary school more often than not bullied me. My only friends who lived near me also bullied me half the time. I said and did stupid and dumb things and ruined the first 16 years of my life. I made friends in high school but got ditched by them multiple times. One of them said they were annoyed with me for some reason. Another started spreading lies about me and laughing in my face about it

The thing is, I don’t blame people for hating me. Every time I speak to someone I feel like I’m annoying them, like I’m nothing but a nuisance, like things would be better in their life if I wasn’t there. Even if I’m trying to make them happy or have fun I am being an annoying piece of shit

Tl;dr I’m constantly thinking that my friends hate me",24Mar2019,1

120,"I came across a tough lesson today while in the changing room of a Target; I'm healthy, but I still feel as though I should be losing weight.

&amp;#x200B;

Just a little backstory: I'm a 25 year old male, 5'9"", and 136 lbs (+/- 2 lbs).  On the BMI (which I know isn't entirely accurate), I'm a 21, which is almost exactly in the median for a normal weight for a man my height.  This is probably the healthiest I've been in my entire life, but getting to this point was a struggle physically, mentally, and emotionally.  I've struggled with fluctuating weight all my life.  First, when I was in my early elementary years, I was always told I was too thin, so I took that as an indication that I could eat anything I wanted to at any time.  By the time I started middle school, my lifestyle of eating junkfood was starting to catch up.  Kids started noticing and would let me eat anything they couldn't finish (""give it to \[OP\], he'll finish it off no problem"").  Sometimes I'd be the target of some ridicule, though not always because of my weight (I was heavy into the whole emo thing from 2007-08, skulls, long hair, etc.).  By the time I'm about ready to graduate middle school (8th grade), I would skip meals because I wanted the weight to come off by the time I started high school, but all too often I'd relapse and feel terrible, to the point where I'd be on the brink of tears.  I felt trapped in some strange addiction.

&amp;#x200B;

By the time high school starts, I just accept that I'll always be overweight, and I allow myself to fall into a cycle of eating for the sole purpose of comfort.  There were days I'd eat a whole pizza by myself after school after having eating a full lunch plus dessert only 2 hours prior.  After the pizza was finished, my mom (often overworked and not wanting to cook) would offer to pick something up from the drive-thru, which thrilled me.  I was drinking upwards of a 6 pack of mountain dew or Dr. Pepper daily and keeping through with my eating habits.  By the time I finish 10th grade, I am obese (at a BMI just barely above overweight) and doctors considering putting me on some blood pressure medication.  Can you imagine what that did to the self-esteem of a 16 year old boy?  Other kids my age were going to parties, dances, etc. and I was pretty much a loner who would need to take BP meds.  Meanwhile, I'm the object of a lot of other kids' jokes or insults, and this was pretty much the case every day, and it was almost always based on my appearance.  This was probably around the time I started feeling isolated from my peer group.  I wasn't sleeping more than around 2-4 hours per night, my grades started slipping, I went from a 3.2 GPA to a 2.0 in less than a year, and I didn't care about anything.  I started sleeping in class to make up for the loss of sleep at night.  And then I started sleeping almost all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

By the time I'm 18, I reach the heaviest I've ever been at 210 lbs.  When I saw the scale go past the 100s for the first time, it was like feeling everything sink.  I'd never felt worse.  I did end up graduating high school (there was a period of time where I was thinking I wouldn't graduate, or that I'd just drop out), and as soon as I left that toxic environment, I felt truly free for the first time in my life.  (I know it's cliche to say, but high school was with absolute certainty the worst part of my life).  I decided that I was almost always going to be miserable, so I might as well try to make myself feel better, and that was by getting healthier or losing weight.  I started dieting when I was 18, and I didn't do any fad diet either.  I was replacing cheeseburgers with grilled chicken, fried chicken with fish, french fries with salad, ice cream with yogurt, and (most importantly) soda with water.  No more Capn' Crunch or Trix, either.  It was Raisin Bran or oatmeal.  Results came slowly, but steadily, and reaching down to 195 lbs a few months in was the biggest relief I'd felt in a decade because I knew I was finally doing something right.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm gonna skip over my college years because there was a whole new set of struggles there, but none weight/esteem related.

&amp;#x200B;

7 years after I started my diet (and not stopping my diet, save for some treats here and there), I am at a consistently healthy weight.  It took a couple years for me to get to where I am (I'd say I started re-entering ""normal weight"" territory around age 21), but it's been steady since then.  But so many things since I was 18 have changed as well: I cut off all my hair, finished my undergrad Summa, worked a handful of jobs, found my career path, made friends, had my first kiss, first girlfriend, went to my first concert, et al.  But one thing remained constant; my self esteem.  When I was 18, I just thought losing the weight would naturally boost my self-esteem, but as it turns out, nearly 2 decades of depression and isolation does a number on your psyche.  And today, March 24, 2019, in a changing room at Target, I came to the full realization that I am literally entering my peak years, healthy as ever, and still struggling with body image issues as I looked at my reflection with the same level of disgust I would have if I were 18 and 80 lbs heavier.

&amp;#x200B;

Fortunately, I've learned little ""tricks"" over the years to bring myself out of my pits of self hatred where I cognitively evaluate myself and play ""devil's advocate"" with the part of me that wants to feel bad about myself.

&amp;#x200B;

The moral of the story here is that you definitely should do whatever you can/are capable of in improving yourself in a healthy fashion, if you feel that a change is necessary.  However, the work you put into yourself isn't going to necessarily work on your self-esteem either.  The latter of which takes A LOT of work, or at least it does for me.  And believe me, I still have demons I'm fighting, but the goal I set for myself every day is to be at least as well off as I was the day prior (and to make ""better mistakes tomorrow"" as one of my college profs used to say).

&amp;#x200B;

If you feel like I do now, or like I did when I was in my teens, I hope my anecdote is able to leave you with something.  Every day, challenge yourself to name one thing you like about yourself or that you're really good at.  Really focus and analyze your positive qualities and don't just fester on the negative ones.  And remember; Rome wasn't built in a day.  Any day where you manage to take a step forward is a good day.  I'm still working on myself, and I hope you are as well : )",24Mar2019,3

122,"So I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this and to be honest I'm going to be posting it in a few places but here goes nothing. 

I'm currently still living with my mother, not through choice but through lack of being able to save up to get my own place. Over the last 7 years, since leaving university, I've had 8 different jobs, most of them ending due to me becoming too stressed and having anxiety attacks making my way in on a morning. 

I have a small group of friends who all seem to be more successful than me and I often feel they only really hang around with me almost out of pity. I have had relationships in the past, but they always end in disaster thanks to a crippling fear of commitment. To make things even better, my astonishingly low self esteem I find myself incredibly nervous any time I talk to the opposite sex and inevitably end up making a fool of myself. 

Basically, I feel like I've no way out of this situation I've been in for so long and am even beginning to get resentful of the few friends I have who find it so easy to connect with other people. I'm really just looking for anybody who can give me advice on how to get out of this slump. 

Also, thanks to the anxiety I mentioned above and the fact that it's very late where I am, there's no way I can wait to watch any responses. I will try to respond in the morning if there are any though. ",24Mar2019,2

124,"Since some time ago, I've got into the habit of being a lazy piece of shit, even more so than I used too. I feel real alienation from my job, and I work from home, so you can imagina how much room that leaves me to just procrastinate and sell smoke to the bosses. And so, from time to time, I find myself having to catch up on and work all night. 00:00 to 08:00, then maybe sleep a little throughout the day if there's not much current work to do, but most probably keep working until at least 17:00.

Anyway, I'm tired of this. I want to leave my wage job and just start living off the freelance gigs I'm getting. It's a lot of money, and by all accounts it's gonna start to be even more.

I know that it's not optimal. My wife tells me otherwise, and I know she is right: the security that comes from having a metaphorical check every month is too high to just send it to hell. But man, do I want to. It's like a dream. Being my own boss, having the respect and appreciation of my clients and business partners, working with responsibility and drive because I'm implicated and not a fucking drone. Working on my own schedule.

I know it's not going to happen, but it's still on my mind. What a dream... It's funny how dreams used to be being a famous movie director, winning an Oscar, and nowadays it's just having as few complications as possible and getting as much cash as my hands can cram. I just want it all to be peaceful, and quiet, and getting a cleaner so I don't have to do any of that either, and then it would be just me, my wife and my little one.

Also, in my mind, I keep telling myself that smoking weed again would be great as motivation and relaxation, but I'm pretty sure it's just escapism. Someday again, maybe. Tonight, just Red Bull.",24Mar2019,2
