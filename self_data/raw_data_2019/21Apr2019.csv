0,"So for as long as i (25f) can remember i have had an issue with the size of my breasts, i can recall being 14 and knowing it was always going to be a massive insecurity for me. 11 years later and i still havnt learnt to accept them. I feel like ill always be a developing girl rather than a fully grown woman.

Ive looked into plastic surgery and even have the money available but id be put off by the ‘hard’ look implants would give.

I always dress to hide my chest and wear horribly padded bras, even when im laying in bed on my own at night i hate the way material feels against them as theyre so flat and small. 

I feel inadequate and very unfairly held back in so many areas of my life because my body doesn’t match how i want to look in my head. 

Ive tried for years to accept my body but i still cant, id be lying to myself if i said i had ever been truly proud of how i looked. 

Any advice or similar situations from people..?

Tl;dr hate my small chest, very damaging to my self esteem..",21Apr2019,0

Except this one thing: I want someone to care about me as much as they care about their boyfriends. 

I feel so stupid. We'll hang out, and then one of their boyfriends is having a breakdown. since im the only one capable of driving, I take them. 
Or my other friend, who's boyfriend might as well live in another state, she'll call him every night. Every night.  

Im so happy for them, but im emotionally jelous? How dare these punks come out of nowhwre and take my space in both my friend's heart? That sounds aweful. Im not a mean person. I love my friends very much.  Its wonderful that they have a romantic relationship in which they are happy, sexually satisfied. And obviously in love.

But im so touch starved I almost cried when one of them hugged me the other day. Im not sure i even know what love feels like. Not even my parents love me, and I take so long to open up to people. Im crying as i write this, fuck. Im trying my best. 

Its no one's fault but mine. I get flirted with but i dont know how to read it. I dont even know if ive felt romantic love, but i want to care about someone, and maybe be cared about as well. I want to be open with someone. It took me 5 years to open up to my friends.  I dont know how to date.

5,"We all know that one person who is thin but doesn't count calories or follow any rigid rules around eating. This could be attributed simply to genetics, however they usually are also the people who simply 'forget to eat' or who are content to only have a bit of something and not feel mentally deprived. Then there are those of us who are always thinking about our next meal, who feel mentally tortured when deprived or restricted from certain foods which we will inevitably overeat if given the chance. I'm not a fat person by any means, I exercise daily and consider myself quite fit, if I do say so myself. But I wish to rid myself of the power and mental space food takes up in my life. I have tried counting calories but it seems to unnatural to me and unsustainable, plus it severely limits my eating options when I go to parties or family's houses.

Sorry if this isn't the right/best place to post this, but I am unsure of where else to do so. I was scrolling through Facebook and came across a typical ""Happy Birthday"" post my parents do every year for my birthday and I thought I'd share it! I knew a little bit about the story but never so much detail!

Enjoy!

From Mom's Facebook:

Back in 1998, I was living in Rettendon, England, with my husband. I had just found out I was pregnant. Several weeks later, they told me I had miscarried. After continual sickness, I went back to the dr, where they told me I was pregnant. (still? how? what?) We questioned the diagnosis, so they sent me to the hospital for an ultrasound. The ultrasound showed no baby, but I was definitely pregnant, so they told me it was a tubal pregnancy. They admitted me, put me to sleep, and did emergency surgery - only to find NO baby in my tubes. Soooo, again, they told me I had miscarried. I was sent home on narcotics and meds to control the depression, and became very ill. Back to the doctor, and my diagnosis: ""you're pregnant"". WHAT?! Yes, that is what they said. Nine months later, this is what happened (stolen from my husband) :

&amp;#x200B;

We went past the due date and so we had to check in to be ‘induced’ Of course we were on an open ward with a dozen other women, some of who were also being induced others that just had problems. Well time rolled on and none of their inducing seemed to be working so they decided to up the stakes. From this point forward the story takes on a Lemony Snicket…esqe feel to it but I swear every word of it is the truth…….

&amp;#x200B;

So the midwife decided to break my wife’s waters, which in itself wasn’t pleasant, but it worked, in fact it worked so well that it sent everyone into a panic. My wife went immediately in to severe labour, so bad that the midwife thought she was going to give birth right there right now. She rushed off to get the wheelchair to take her to the labour ward. A moment later she returned, her face was ashen, "" There is a problem , you are going to have to walk"" she said rather snappily. My wife and I looked at her like she had grown three extra heads. ""What?"". I don’t have time to explain but you are about to have this baby and you can’t have it here""

&amp;#x200B;

At that moment a small kid about 5 years old stuck his head under he curtain and said ""hello"". My wife was naked from the waist down gushing out fluid, blood and god knows what else and there was this kid trying to start a conversation. Apparently it was visiting hour and so the open ward was full of well wishers. The nurse told me to get all our stuff together because we had to get to the labour ward NOW!. She wrapped a blanket around my wife’s waist and swished the curtain back, as I scrambled to pack up our gear and rush off after them. In doing, this I stepped into the ""waters"". I had taken my shoes of as we had been there all day so my socks just soaked up all that nasty stuff, not that I cared. I caught up with them just as they rounded the corner in the ward into the main section. My wife was having contractions, the blanket had fallen off almost immediately the midwife was almost hysterically screaming at my wife to keep moving and I was bring up the rear limping along with a hastily packed carry bag and slappy wet feet and I took a look around and there were about 50 people staring at us with the same open mouthed shock horror look. Men, Women, Kids grandparents, time seemed to stand still for a minute I scrambled in vain to hide my wife’s modesty. I will for ever more have ingrained in my memory the look of an expectant first time couple’s faces, what they must have thought I can only imagine.

&amp;#x200B;

Well we made it somehow to the entrance to the ward only to find out that the elevator was out…… WTF! The Labour ward is on the 2nd floor (which is the same as an American 3rd floor… don’t ask) and the elevator is out of order?!?!? ""You are going to have to go up the stairs….."" I faintly heard and then as I came back to reality with a slam, ""You are going to have to climb the stairs"" the midwife repeated in the same stern tone she had resorted to earlier. So my poor wife had to climb 4 flights of stairs naked , in hard labour, with only me and a bitchy midwife for support. How she managed to get up there I will never know but she did it.

&amp;#x200B;

When we got to the top we were greeted by ….. wait for it…. The fire brigade! 12 firemen in full gear all standing there watching my poor half naked very pregnant wife stumble finally into a wheel chair and being whisked off to the labour room.

&amp;#x200B;

By way of explanation of all this I should tell you at this point the reason for what had transpired, although we didn’t know it until well after the baby was born. When our Midwife had decided to break my wife’s waters she had phoned up to the labour ward to send down another midwife with a wheel chair. The midwife was on her way down in the elevator when a fire had broken out in one of the break rooms. A bagel had ignited in a toaster that evidently wasn’t meant for bagels the resultant smoke had set off the fire alarm system and shut down the elevator, trapping our midwife and wheelchair in the elevator between floors and summoning the Firemen. Because my Wife had already started heavy labour the midwife in the inducement ward felt that despite the circumstances it was imperative to get her to the labour ward regardless, and it was a good job as it turned out as there were complications with the birth that would have been difficult to deal with elsewhere. She did later apologize for her tone, but she was somewhat panicked herself and knew she had to be firm to stand a chance of getting her up to the ward.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:

My parents were told they miscarried several times and even did an emergency surgery but were not able to find me. Several months later, a small fire had brakes out in the middle of my mom in HEAVY labor. When the midwife sent for a wheelchair to take her to the labor ward, the elevator (with the wheelchair) was shut down and so she had to walk up several flights of stairs while in labor.",21Apr2019,9
14,"This morning my buddy calls me up and says “hey do you want to go on a double date with my dates friend?” “Ok sure” his idea of a good date is the bar, on a Saturday night. With loud music. We exchanged pictures through my mutual friend she’s real cute. I kinda feel like she’ll be disappointed when she sees me. Not that I sent a deceiving picture or anything. I’m going to try and sway the group to maybe take a walk around the town primarily so I can talk to my date and the others.",21Apr2019,9
15,"I remember being ten years old and wanting to have a girlfriend for the first time in my life, I was young and it was cute or whatever but I didnt tell a soul for years. Ive also been very shy and depressed for most of my life. That made a relationship very fucking hard to happen. Depressed me never put on a mask like other people talk about, depressed me was a pussy and everyone could probably see how shit I felt. I was totally awkward and uncomfortable, as a whole I was worthless as a human being. I dont remember when depressed me started, but I remember when it got to its worst points. 

Im 17 now. Ive been well and have stayed well since about July- August of 2018. This has led to a few things. Now that Ive finally started talking to people, (I wanna say 'again' but the last time I remember having a lot of friends was elementary school) ive started talking to some girls too. 

That longing to be with someone never left me either, that feeling I had when I was 10 has stayed within me and grown too.

Ive actually 'talked' (Ive obviously talked to all of these girls but you know what I mean) to about 4 girls(maybe 5 idk if a couple count).

Ive been snapchatting too many to count off the top of my head(never ever thought I would be able to say that.)

And Ive been on one date. 

All of this has happened since about new Years and now that Ive broken the ice im always talking to my friends about girls I see and girls I am talking to atm.

Lets talk about that girl I went on a date with. She's adorable and sweet, but a couple days after our date(which she said went really well) she told me that she had only recently broken up with her ex and wasnt ready to date like she thought she was. Then apologized and said she wasnt trying to waste my time. 

That was totally okay and I understood, told her to take her time and what not.

Its been about two months since then and we still snapchat and have a short conversation here and there. Recently Ive been trying to talk to her more thinking maybe we could become closer and eventually I might ask her to go out on a second date if she seems like shes ready. 

Well heres the thing: she rarely texts me unless I text her first. For the last few days Ive been trying to talk to her more than usual. Our conversations never really go anywhere. We've got some things in common and she seemed really interested in me leading up to and on the date. She also had no problem staying casual friends afterward, so I feel like she would be more open to talk to me. Yesterday was by far the shortest shes ever been with me and I havent tried to talk to her yet today either. 

Im not really sure what to do because she still sends me snapchats a lot, just never says anything. I want to talk to her but that doesnt seem like an option. Really what I should do is just move on to someone else but I just dont want to. I also have too many opportunities to try talking to her because she snapchats me so much.

Maybe Im bad at snapchatting and I come off as awkard idk.

So tonight, ive been feeling those same feelings that ive had for years. Pretty inensely too. Im pretty touch starved and would kill to just cuddle with someone right now. Im feeling like shit and I think the reason I want to text that girl so much might be because im lonely(which is an awful reason to do anything).

Im not good at starting things with girls, most of the ones ive talked to have aproached me first and I really dont know where to go from here.

So, all in all. Im doing better than I was awhile ago but damn I need someone in my life.

Been a sad sap for years and now that im not ive been trying to talk to girls. Things are not going smoothly.",21Apr2019,29

i dated a boy i never loved for a good portion of my life

it’s started when he kissed me, i didn’t want to kiss him. i was scared and flustered and wanted him to leave my life right then and there but he didn’t.

we started dating. i felt forced into it because he was very insistent and i knew he carried a knife and could easily overpower me

he consistently raped me. he used me as a sex toy basically. he told me that my own problems didn’t matter, and that my one job was to satisfy him in every way. i had to let him use me, i had to solve all his problems and carry his emotional baggage. my problems were my own to deal with and i had to deal with them or forget about them because if i had things going on i couldn’t help him.

he was rich, he had braces, i can’t go in my friends kitchen because it looks to much like his and i don’t want to remember him ever.

he constantly used me, asked me to send him photos and videos of me doing things accompanied with dirty captions about “how he made me feel”. i felt filthy and disgusting and at my lowest.

he fetishized me cutting myself, rape, and me being trans. he used me so often, i began to just dissociate every time i was with him so i souls t have to remember what he did to me

he killed him self. he forced it on me, he said it was my fault because i hadn’t done a good enough job dealing with his problems and got mad every time i tried to suggest he needs professional help.

I have an adorable dog Ernie, who is a 5 year old boxer/beagle mix. I love taking him on long walks when it’s nice out. There’s also a lot of Pokémon Go stuff near my house so it’s a double win.

And now our story begins.


While taking over the gym nearest my house, Ernie poops. Ernie is NOTORIOUS for walking in his own shit if I don’t move him away asap. So I take a step-two steps to my right. Cue the crazy lady (CL). CL is yelling across the street to me from inside her house.

CL: excuse me I just saw your dog poop aren’t you going to clean it up!?!

Me: yeah, except I’m in the middle of something.

CL: no, I saw you walking away you weren’t going to clean it!! I bet you don’t even have any bags with you!!!!!!!

Me, continuing to stare at my phone taking over this gym: Uhhhh yeah, they’re kinda on my leash.

CL: well I’m going to watch you until you clean it up!!!!!!

Me: ok have fun.

CL: my brother is a cop in this area and it’s against [city]’s law to not pick up after you dog!!!!!!

Me: holy shit lady, obviously I’m doing something and not going anywhere! Besides is he the poop police!?!?




There was at least two more back and forths of “I’m still watching you” and “ok”s. From there I finished taking over the gym, got my items, and cleaned up after Ernie. Embarrassingly for me, I did have a choice name I yelled up to her as I was taking my leave, as well as possibly threatening to throw his poop at her house (which I absolutely would not do). But for real, who acts like this?? As soon as someone says yes, they’ll clean up, shouldn’t that be the end of it?

I enjoy what I'm studying but I'm also sure it won't bring me any employment once I graduate and due to my financial situation I think its too late for me to change majors (I already changed once). Now, to address the title, due to my living situation I constantly think of contradictory things about myself. Sometimes I believe I am amazing at what I do, and other times I feel like a failure. Sometimes I believe I'm going to be succesful and others that I'm gonna end up being a dead beat. Most of the time both thoughts come back to back, I could be thinking I'm awesome and seconds later I'm thinking of what a dissapointment I must be. This is true for a lot of things, sometimes my mind makes me feel like I'm the best driver in the world, even though I've crashed twice coming out of my own home. Other times I may think I most be an amazing basketball player, even tho I haven't played in years and thoughts like that. 

I think I want to be succesful so bad and being able to afford whatever I want, buy my family what they need/want without having to look at my bank account every day, that I'm beggining to think of scenarios where I am this amazing and succesful person when I'm not.

(I’m going to be very critical of him, just a warning) He has a job that he is always late for and he called in to work during one of his first weeks. 

He is incredibly pessimistic. He always says stuff like “You know, nothing matters. Like no one matters.” He talks like the world is going to end soon (like in our lifetime) or like he’s gonna hurt us or someone else. He tells us that the sooner we stop caring about him, the better off we’ll be.

I’m currently studying abroad in Europe just about to finish my last year away from my country which has mad eme miss a lot of things going on in my family and friends and for some reason my family members don’t think i need to know those things that change the way me and my one brother live our lives.

A couple of days ago i came back to my country for Easter and as i started catching up with the people in my life and people that surround me and my family and even though everyone with family issues can agree with me that people always take sides for their own convenience these past few days I’ve been sensing that its especially strong since I’m the only person that surrounds my parents that is not willing to take sides people are trying to win me over to their sides in case of a divorce, both my parents have their ways of trying to make me hate the other parent my father will always point out that my mother has something shady going on (she seems at first glance extremely nice and unable to kill a fly) and he says that he is the provider of the family which just feels as if he were saying that if I’m not with him i wont have financial stability, on the other side my mother always says about how shitty of a human being my dad is by saying that he wont let her have peace because he thinks she is cheating on him with family friends.
Unfortunately now the shit talking between sides has now turned into people that support them trying to rot my mind the most recent example of this was on my first day back when i went to the garden with my brothers girlfriend to have a smoke and catch up with things back home since my brother is shit at talking about serious things, talking to her i realised she was talking a lot about my parents which was not common for her and at one point it became very obvious that she was trying to shift my way of thinking by mentioning that my mother had suspicions about my father having a second family. Shitty thing is that her saying that actually made me aware of all the weird things my parents do/hide.
Yesterday i went to one of my mates house with a couple friends since we were drinking and i didn’t want my parents finding out i decided to stay the night at his which made me arrive to my house at around 11AM and by that time my father wasn’t there so i assumed he had gone off to one of our other houses which he plans on fixing up for his retirement, he takes a lot of care to that house and will often dedicate whole days to just cleaning around, which is why today i started seeing red flags i mentioned that i wanted to celebrate him on his birthday by going to the cinema at 8PM to which he agreed so when the clock said 11PM i started getting weirded out since it’s Easter and there is no traffic and that distance is normally covered in 20 min at one point i got scared and called him when he answered he sounded uncomfortable he replied very fast as if he was trying to get away from talking and was slightly coding his speech during that phone call he mentioned that he would be on the road soon but he completely forgot about going to the cinema which has always been a tradition between my family which made it that extra bit weirder, when my father arrived home quite late (12) something strange happened my mother had previously mentioned that she wanted to go to AC so that she could receive in person her part of her parents will which i thought was very unusual because her parents died 6+ years ago and she just now tried to get her part but she told me that’s couple of months ago my father took our family book and hid it in the safe because of safety since its an important legal document where i live and that she needed it if she wanted to go to AC but she didn’t want to mention it to my father since he might say he just lost it, when the sound of my house’s gates opening went off i herd my mother running towards the room the safe is in and i heard some fumbling of metals which I’m just assuming weer keys and it sounded panicked she quickly ran back to where she was sitting before my father even came in and she just pretended like she was just chilling there but she had no idea i saw her doing that and i have reasons to believe that she might not be home tomorrow because she has a past of fleeing since she is bi-polar but this time i think she wont be alone and is taking my older with her since he also has problems with my father because he isn’t working or studying and just sits around spending my dads money with his girlfriend and of course my dad isn’t cool with that.

I know that is not an ending but that’s just where my life is atm and there is just a small chance i wont have a healthy family in the morning

Maybe after some more time, when I have more things to share with and talk about, I will have no other option but to start.


Another way to enhance self love I found is writing a diary almost all days, when I need to be heard.

On so many of the dates I’ve been on in the recent past, if I tell a guy I don’t want to hook up at all or I don’t want to have sex, he doesn’t drop it. He’ll just keep bringing it up like “oh so you’re sure you don’t want to” or “so you said you don’t want to have sex on the first date”? And they just will keep trying to bring it up until either I give in or I decide to leave. 

I feel like so many guys nowadays think they’re “good guys” because they would never physically force a woman, but that doesn’t make someone a good person, it just means you’re not a terrible person. Good people are respectful of others and should understand and listen immediately when someone says they’re not in the mood or aren’t comfortably with something

1.  When you go shopping with a lady, bring some entertainment!  Whether it be your ipad or iphone!  Youre gonna need it!

2.  Whenever a lady shows you something, always say “it nice!”  Even if you dont like it!  If she wants more input then you say “it looks really nice!”  If she doesnt like it, then you don’t like! 

3.  Shopping with a lady takes a long time...maybe up to 3 hours (at least).

4.  Stand in line for a lady while shes out still shopping in the same store.

5.  Stay with her at check out!  She might need a last second opinion...see rule 2.

6.  Carry her purchased bags!  Yes, you will carry a lady’s bags!  It could be one, it could be ten...you will carry them!  

7.  Always walk next to the lady through the store or mall.  Never behind, never in front...to the side of her.

8.  When it comes to picking your clothes...speak up!!!  If you don’t like it, say it!!!

41,"Last year she moved to my school from somewhere in ohio and ever since the first day she came we instantly clicked. We’ve been talking all day non stop for like 7-8 months and we have pink hearts on snapchat for a while now. We also comment cute stuff on our insta pages We haven’t had a single day where we don’t talk to eachother, We know eachother like the back of our hands and i’ve never been so comfortable with someone in my life. We’re pretty flirty with eachother and we both know we have feelings for eachother. 

However she’s one of those girls that hasn’t had a boyfriend before, she’s never even kissed anyone before. She’s also pretty shy and hates her friends. Her friends are the typical high school sluts while she is more mature and not slutty. We both have heaps of friends but they’re all in different places. We have hung out a few times by ourselves and heaps of times at parties.  Usually I don’t get invited to those parties because i’m not close with any of them. Not to mention she’s really attractive so she has guys hitting her up left right and center 

Sometimes when I make a move she puts her guard up and ignores it, and even sometimes gets really short with me. This is the case like 40% of the time, but also sometimes gets really flirty and drops big hints herself. We’ve had “the talk” and she said she has feelings but just wants to go with the flow, whatever that means. But then for example today she’s made a few jokes about us getting married/dating, none of my female friends do that except her.

Maybe i’ve been hella friendzoned but I don’t really believe that’s a thing. We’re in our last year of school so I understand if she’s just waiting till school is finished to start something serious, now that i’m writing this I actually think this is the case 🤷‍♀️

Idek man like it’s pretty draining loving someone this much 

I’ve got some questions if anyone can help, would be much appreciated 

What are some subtle flirty hints things girls say that could be misinterpreted as just casual conversation? 

What are some things girls can say that might come across as flirty but are actually them just being friendly

I was the only woman in the place with short hair,  the only one with a big arm tattoo, bar none I had the cheapest dress in the room being from Ross for like $13, can't walk corrctly in heels, didn't have enough time to spike my hair, and beside the fact have had several remarks made in the past about my appearance with family.. 

Once about a year ago wearing the same dress to a dance party where my boyfriend's mother said my calves where so big and looked so strong, knowing full well that they just looked chunky as they always have. 

And another remark about a month ago by my boyfriend's brother (who gave the speech) that my boyfrie d's ex was his favorite that he has ever dated and asked twice what my boyfrie d thought if my hair.

A group rolls in, 3 guys, 3 girls.  First they order 2 bottles of Don Julio 1942 Anejo Tequila that comes in it's own box.  Ok, I later (now) googled that, and figuring in strip club prices, that was probably a $500 bill.

I was so drunk, I went on Grindr and tried to hook up with as many men as possible. Not a single successful hook up, and it’s probably because I just let myself go.

So, I turned to snap chat, posted my drinking adventure, asked for a friend to talk with, and no one stepped up.

 I’m pretty upset, because I think I was going to kill myself, but I don’t know for sure how I was feeling last night. Since when I get drunk, I’m usually happy, but this time I was just lost...

A bunch of times when I've when out for drinks or a meal a woman they will literally pretend the bill doesn't exist until I straight up in her face say this is what she owes.  Even then I can think of 6 times off the top of my head when they tried to get me to pay for it.

53,"I have a very distant cousin. Well she is kinda a cousin, she is adopted. 

One night we were sitting in her bedroom, I on a chair, she on her bed. My Mom and Dad, My Uncle and Aunt were out drinking so they wouldn't come back for a good while.

We were talking for ages and somehow the subject of how legit us being related could be, but I always thought she was a cousin to make her feel welcomed. It would be cruel to treat her any different than other cousins.

For some reason, I sat on her bed to. We both lied down and looked at one another. I said something about her being a desperate little slag (jokingly) so she jumped on top of me started hitting me. I then grabbed her arms to stop it. She leaned down and kissed me. Some fucking how she had hand cuffs, and cuffed my hands to her bed.

I was stronger than her but I couldn't do much. I kinda just let go and we both started kissing. I had to stop it. My first kiss.

She was still on top of me and even she didn't really know what to do. It was her first kiss to apparently.  She started taking her clothes off, top first of course, she gave me a look she has never given me before and then said ""Do you like them?"". We had already kissed for a while, but I was sure it wouldn't go further. I had already said ""No, stop!"". She didn't. And she asked again ""Do you like them?"" ""I don't know"" I replied with ""fuck off."" 

""We shouldn't go any further"" I said, but she insisted. I was kicking my legs so damn hard, also trying to have a piss in her face, but she had already grabbed it and was moving. ""Are you on something for fucks sake, get the fuck off me!"" ""I'm on you"". I just gave up after that. Pathetic, I know. She then proceeded to have sex with me, even without protection, that's what got me the most. She was on a pill she said that stops her from getting pregnant, thankfully. I came in her, she got off and said. ""You've cum, now eat it out."" I gave her the biggest wtf look even then, but really wasn't surprised at all. 

She got up and put it in my face. She used her hands to open my mouth on to her pussy and I thought. ""Well, if I don't just do this, she'll just get more violent."" I regret giving up and complying, so much. I tried to bite her, to hurt her, she gave me a huge slap, across the face. So kissed instead. She then hit my balls, hard. I was fucking screaming by this point she shouted ""LICK!"". So I licked. Sounds stupid but I licked hard. She used her hands to, and then she came in my face. She licked it all off, but then tongued me. Disgusting, stupid that I let it happen.

""We're done now. Thankyou.""

I have never been able to talk to anyone about it, we were 14 when it happened I'm 15 now. It's so hard as a boy, to come out with being sexually assaulted.

I know what people are thinking. What's the big deal if you're unemployed, you'll get a job. I know that but sometimes not having a job for so long just makes you feel so useless. 

&amp;#x200B;

Back story, I've been living in abroad in the Czech Republic for over a year and a half. Three months ago, I left my job because I was really miserable there and wanted to try something new. Most people would leave a said job knowing they have a job secured once they leave. Not me. I wanted to leave as fast as I could. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had spending issues in the past and that had lead to me having over £2000 worth of debt from credit cards and an overdraft (that I took out when I was in University) that I still haven't paid off. Since I've been unemployed and actively looking for jobs where I'm currently situated, I haven't managed to begin paying any of it off and I'm pretty stuck now because I still haven't found anything. My parents back home keep receiving phone calls and letter warnings from debt collection agencies.  I was, of course, paying it off when I had a job. I have called all these agencies to let them know that I can't pay off anything because I'm unemployed, and fortunately, they were quite understanding, however, the interest fees keep piling up. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been such a struggle not being able to find anything, especially when I have the skills and experience for the jobs I'm applying to. At this point, I should be moving back with my parents in the U.K and accept that I wasn't able to accomplish what I wanted to do here, which was to live and work abroad. I don't want to move back, also, my boyfriend is originally from this country and I can not bear to be away from him. I've been avoiding all contact with my family because I feel like such a failure. My dad texted me some time ago saying how proud of me he was. I still haven't told them that I've been unemployed for so long. They have their own financial hardships to deal with and I do not want to be a burden and ask them for help. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't find a job here, even though I've been to over 50+ interviews and even made it through to second rounds, but no luck. I have a history of clinical depression and it seems to be hitting me the hardest this time. I have no idea what to do, I'm really stuck and I would really appreciate some advice. I also can't afford health insurance in this country (yes that's how broke I am) and my boyfriend has been working 3 jobs to support us with rent and food. What's wrong with me? Why aren't I liked? What am I doing wrong? Why can't I get a job? How can I pay off these things and help out my boyfriend if no one wants to hire me? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm too prideful to ask for financial help elsewhere. I feel like I got myself into this situation and need to get myself out.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do.

57,"[My Post on Medium](https://medium.com/@JDor/the-bottom-of-my-deep-dark-hole-f71b8a6770bc?source=friends_link&amp;sk=bb3cc3320bc1c36ace3cf485394d8e2f)

I am determined that this journal, this blog — whatever it is — will not be the writing of someone who reluctantly walks closer to, and ultimately commits suicide. No. These writings will document my journey out of an unimaginably deep dark hole and back to a world of color that is not black and white.

But this must be the bottom. It has to be. There have been many times before where I thought I was at the bottom — but the sad reality is that our holes can always get deeper. Someone somewhere came up with the phrase   
“Once you have hit rock bottom, there is nowhere to go but up.” But they did not realize there is a darker truth, that holes can always get deeper. We can always feel smaller, more inferior, more worthless, more consumed, more afraid, more alone, more confused, more disoriented, struggle more with our memory, and even lose our ability to think and process information in any rational way. There is always more of us that can evaporate no matter how deep of a hole were in.

But no more! No deeper! I won’t do it and I can’t do it. I am clinging to whatever I can get a hold of, whatever roots might be buried deep with me. I am pressing my back and feet against the sides of the hole as hard as I possibly can. I won’t let my feet sink any deeper into the mud. When I chose to write about my experience, my life, my reality the other day — what it is like to be this deep — that is my act of will and defiance. To talk about it, to write about it. This is the beginning of my journey out. To not be ashamed and write about what I feel, my struggles, and to say they are valid! That I am valid. I matter and I exist, I am not inferior to anyone else.

When I had not yet hit my personal bottom I did not write. I could not think of what to write. I did not believe writing could be helpful. I felt overwhelmed. So I wrote nothing. It was only when I felt the most unlike expressing myself, the most uncomfortable and ugly, that I decided to write. At first I only wrote a little. It was difficult and I wanted to stop. But then I wrote a lot. It only scratched the surface of my struggle. So there is much more to write and to express.

I think I am learning the secret to writing and expressing yourself. DO IT. Don’t wait until you have the words. It might feel uncomfortable at first, it might feel like you can’t put anything into words — but if you write then you will write words. You might write a little or a lot. You don’t have to write a lot. Sometimes less is more. Manifest what is inside you in your own words. Let it be structured or unstructured, whatever is easiest. You can always change it later. Do not censor yourself or write for an imaginary audience or person. Write for you.

When I was very young I loved to write, and I wrote for myself. To explore imaginary concepts. To follow different thoughts and see where they took me. I wrote for my own enjoyment. One day I found myself writing a story in middle school, and during my choir class I placed it under my chair. Some boys found it — they laughed and they mocked me. I felt horrible and that was the last time I wrote for myself, for my own joy. I would write plenty later. But it would always be for someone else. For an assignment, an essay test question, maybe to some audience or person I sought validation from. But not for me, at least not until now. This is for me. If anyone out there finds value in my words then it can also be for you. But that is not required. This is mine. These are my thoughts. My words.

I hope that as I write about my recovery from the deepest darkest hole of mental illness that someone might come across what I write. Someone who is also lost — or who will be. I hope that person will see in my writing a reflection of their own struggle to breathe, to stay afloat, to stay alive. By the time they read this my deepest darkest point, this point, may exist only in my memory. They, or perhaps you, I hope will be able to see it is possible to live a nightmare and to change all the things inside that feel unchangeable, those things that keep you anchored to the nightmare. I hope my journey might serve as a road map for others who find themselves marooned on a similar vacant island. Its a nice thought — that my suffering could be a beacon of hope for others. But it does not have to be true. What I write is meant for me. To explore, to express, and to grow beyond.

I write this now feeling something a little more than just an empty shell and I am reaching now to take my humanity back. I search for meaning in a place that feels just a little less like a void. I write alone fantasizing about meaningful beautifully complicated relationships that I may not have now but will. This is the most painful period of my life that one day will only exist as a memory. This is something I will surpass and overcome. The next thirty five years will be better than the first.",21Apr2019,2

We got back later in the day to find multiple vomits on the back deck and our  dog gagging, about to vomit again. We had no clue what to do and were so scared. He was and still is acting pretty unresponsively which definitely isn’t himself. The vet is closed because it’s Easter and so there was nothing we could do for him. My gf had to go to work and is there until 11:30pm. It’s currently 9:30 and I’m at home with the dog and in utter despair. He won’t sit in the couch and follow me around, he just wants to lie down on his bed. I lie next to and talk to him and just wish he was able to respond, I wish he was able to understand everything I’m saying. Now I’m just in tears writing this all down as a distraction as to what’s right in front of me. I know he isn’t my dog but it feels just the same, I may have o my spent a week with him but i still feel the connection and I don’t want him to go.

68,"Over the last year i've gone through several issues that have led me to realize that in order to be happy i need to feel that i'm in control of every aspect of my life- school, work, family and friend relationships, fitness/health... as soon as i feel the control slip away, or something doesn't go as expected, i panic, hard. The worst part is that i can actually handle it when the problem only affects me- if everyone else around me (family, co-workers, class friends...) is physically and mentally ok, i can pull through anything. I'm extremely resilient. But as soon as someone gets in a bad mood, or there's a disagreement at home, i become an absolute anxious wreck that can't cope with anything. Or if someone points out how i've failed at doing something, i feel like an absolute loser that can never get anything right. I also constantly worry about the uncertainty of the future, it's something i've been doing all my life. I'll worry about someone close to me dying suddenly, or developing an illness, i'll worry about future arguments that haven't even happened. What if my family suddenly becomes poor? What if there's a terrorist attack? What if i never find a job i like? What if i get fired from my current job? What if my friends decide to stop talking to me? What if i never find new friends?.....it's a never stopping tornado of worries that i can't ignore.

74,"I’m a 18 y/o female in college. The title explains it all and i think it all started because i always felt like i needed other people approval on whatever i do. 

I won’t say i’m attention seeking but i’m pretty sure i’m vain as fuck, something i wish i weren’t. 

I feel like i have this sense of pride to be better than everyone else (which my boyfriend sometimes implies that i actually am). So whenever i look at someone, or see someone’s ig profile, i will immediately look at them and point out flaws they have, “she’s not pretty”, “her fashion sense sucks”, “she doesn’t have any comments on her posts”. If i find flaws, i immediately feel better about myself. 

And once i cant point significant flaws out, i’ll start to get jealous and feel like i’m not enough. And that she or he is better than me, happier than me and living a better life than me. Even though i keep convincing myself that i cant just conclude someone’s life story base on their appearance, social media. 

I have always been like this since a few years back, but it’s gotten so bad now because something happened to me and i kind of lost everything i used to have (popularity, close friends who hype me up) , so i gotten even more insecure about it. I see myself as friendless (although i have quite a few), ugly, fat and so much more. So once i cant find a flaw that makes me feel better, i’ll beat myself up over it. 

I know i sound very entitled, narcissistic and prideful but it’s a nature that i feel like i cannot change and i need help with it because i know i need to stop harping on what i do not have and cherish what i have (my boyfriend and my few friends now). I want to stop asking for more because i may lose sight of what i already have. 

I’m trying everyday but it seems like i can’t help it. 

Does anyone experience this too? Is it bad enough to the extent i should see therapy? i’m still young so i really don’t know if this is serious or just a phase that everyone goes through.., (I will literally spend hours stalking people on ig and have thoughts like oh she’s so pretty and popular and i’m not so i’m a loser)",21Apr2019,5
77,"The Machine^™ marches up the hill, pistons firing in synchronized perfection, engine roaring behind the scenes with a raging fervor. It's ocular devices locked, loaded, and ready to disintegrate the first lifeforms that dared cross its path. But, the mechanical beast was alone, as always.


Fog was the staple of this Easter Sunday. The crisp spring air would feel good on his skin, if he could feel anything at all. Oh, there were feelings in the microprocessor known as the hypothalamus. Yes, there was definitely *something* firing off in that section of the biocomputer, but there was an override protocol in place. Suborbital Cortex God-module once again needed to take control, to avoid a complete systemic collapse.


At the crest of the hill, The Machine^™ pivots, scanning. Primary paradigm matrix claims there is a 34% chance of being followed. Undeniable was the CIA's attempt to push the mechanical pariah all the way out to the university. “Unforeseen circumstances?” Obvious bullshit. There was no way the Starbucks closer to the homeless hibernation housing was closed for any reason other than sabotage.


It presses forward, regardless. Malfunctions are accumulating as the *other* half of the bicameral mind rebels, needing to feel. A water-like substance floods the ocular devices. An auditory outburst is triggered without an executive prompt. Still, The Machine^™ holds tightly to the controls.


Yet, as determined as the “he” is, so too is “she” stubborn. The sister sings. A series linguistic strings are being formed by muse.exe. There was a story brewing. Something about a bomb...or domestic terrorism...or...revolution…


It was too early to see what was being transmitted. The story needed time to develop. So, The Machine^™ lets the gears tick and tick in their hypnotizing rhythmic pulse.


Rounding the corner, the mechanized abomination discoverers a hooded scoundrel peering into one of the local shops. A thief? No. Just another public masturbator. Like clockwork, the man turns just as the real robot clunks past in its army boots and yellow raincoat.


He speaks, but nothing is heard. A hand extends, but there is nothing to give. The Machine^™ continues, noting the rise of the mysterious substance known as “[guilt](https://youtu.be/VLOUWZdLAMg)"" in the associated modules. Absorbed by the emerging story, the inanimate object does not even bother wasting processing power with pointless social games.


An insult is partially processed. This triggers an additional set of emotions that need to be repressed. Social input creates unprecedented stress on the system, needing the majority of primary processes in order to respond at all. It's not a bug, says the Programmer; it's a feature of this model.


Because of those few words, an entire library of the story is lost. Why? Why do these bipedal creatures *need* to play social games? Why do they react rather than act? The Machine^™ does not understand. 


The only time it loses control and falls into the ineptitude of stimulus-response is when *she* has control. It takes so much to hold onto the reins when she is having a tantrum. The Machine^™ is getting dangerously close to melting down with all those repressed circuits trying to live. It uses its air sacs to calm the rest of the system. 


Memory.exe: Yesterday. Lunch. Samaritan Center. Blows nose. “Excuse me, we're eating here.” Shamed. Insulted. Confused. 


Why did they react that way? The Machine^™ did not understand. If [ACTION] is a displeasure to others, then [DON'T DO]. Obvious, but The Machine^™ isn't bothered by similar stimuli. This has led to the lifetime problem of feeling like no one ever told it the rules, and always getting in trouble as a result. Yet, it is constantly bothered by stimuli that others are completely fine with. Why is it shamed for bothering others, when everyone else gets a free pass to bother it?


The Machine^™ is different. It doesn't fit in. It does not operate the same way as anyone else. Why should the biologically different being try to change itself to be what others want it to be, if no one will respect it's unique needs?


What does it even want? It wants to be alone. But, it also wants to be loved and to love. It is obvious: it wants to be alone with others that want to be alone.


The lasers sweep the Starbucks. Happy people in a world a million miles away. They are so different. They will never care about The Machine^™. It will never find another.


A droplet of water tickles its cheek.


Everything goes red.


The Machine^™ stands. Silently, it screams. With its dominant claw, it presses its talons into its chest. Tearing through its coat, the skin is soon pierced. Blood trickles down the hairy chassis, staining its shirt. A sickening crunch catches the attention of the drug store's addicted patrons: The Machine^™’'s rib cage splinters.


A scream echoes in another dimension. Suddenly, The Machine^™ has a hostage. Soaked in blood, the young girl is paralyzed, frozen in fear by the pulsating bomb held above her head. Behind her, the animatronic devil growls: a gaping hole in its chest where [the bomb](https://youtu.be/t8zXY_G639U) used to reside.


The girl squirms as a sanguine waterfall pours on her blonde highlights. One daring coward bolts for the doors, but finds them locked by the psychic manifestations emanating from deep within the circuitry of The Machine^™. With another wave of ethereal energy, the student's head explodes, painting the room red. 


There is no escaping this menace to society. It wasn't locked in with them; they were locked in here with it.


A siren. The trash can morphs into a police officer. Gun cocked, finger around the trigger, ready to blow the microprocessors right out of the freak's head, the officer commands him to surrender.


[Never.](https://youtu.be/_9J8ccza1OI)


*A flash, a bang, and a hole is made between the eyes*


There is silence. An egg can be heard cracking as his skull splits. A light bursts from the skull of the wounded man. A little girl crawls out, beaten, scarred, scared, and bawling her eyes out.


Give me back my heart :’’(


The demoness finds herself alive, tears rolling into her beard, dripping solemnly onto her stuffed animal. Somehow she was sitting in another chair, at another table.


Feelings flooding her soul. The hurting child reminisces in twilight confusion. She was several places at once. She tried to regain her presence, but soon found that she was flung across time, too.

85,"There's a few of these that have caught me lately and it drives me crazy. Crazier. You get the drift.

 
For instance... you're feeling incredibly depressed. You try to get help and support.

Them: ""Well of course you're depressed, you're wallowing in it! Try doing some good things for yourself! Exercise, socialise, enjoy life a little!""

Alright, so I do it, and we'll just handwave the fact that I was doing all these things when I initially began to break down. I exercise, I hang out with friends, I try to do hobbies and projects, I even go out a few times. Hell, I'm even so fortunate that I get a really awesome girlfriend, but still... I wake up most days just wanting this all to be over. So I tell them I'm still depressed. And then the trap springs:

""Oh, it can't be *that* bad, look at all these fun things you're doing! You wouldn't do that if you were depressed!"" It just.. it really gets to me.

Another one is the way they want a show. They want to see the moneyshot. You can't possibly be *really* sad if you're not sobbing hysterically. Even had this with a mental health care professional not long ago, which made me give up on going there for help, but it's not just them. It's friends as well. They want to help, bless their hearts, but they think that forcing me to cry it out is helping. It might be, if it was a passing problem, but it isn't.

So if I cry, I eventually calm down, and they mistakenly (but usually with the best of intentions) think that the problem has been lessened, and *they* feel better, but I don't. However, despite all that, I feel obligated to let them think it. I feel like if I don't let them think that it helps, then they'll stop trying altogether, and I can't handle that.

In the other end, if I don't cry, they find it hard to believe the problem is really there. If I simply say ""I am incredibly sad"" with a straight face, then it loses credibility, because feelings can apparently only exist with external evidence. 

I feel trapped a lot. I feel like I can only be temporarily validated in a problem that has existed my whole life. I have sought a lot of help, and it has done me very little good, because all the diagnoses in the world apparently don't mean shit when I temporarily appear to be okay. It is incredibly exhausting to live like this.",21Apr2019,2

89,"The reason I care so much is because we are so close. We have always been close and we have always understood each other. Having so much in common, it hurts me to see him be so anxious about spending money. I just want to help without distancing myself from him.

We live next door, in small apartments. One year ago, his girlfriend moved in with him. She has been a friend of mine since years, and they met through me at some point. She was always generous but since she moved in with him, she slowly became worse than him in respect to money. She is generally very self-conscious and over analyzes everything, and she is also very dependent on her surroundings, so it is not very strange that she changed so much but I can't experience it no more.

I noticed years ago that my cousin is tight with money. Whatever we talked about, he would mention how much it costs or how expensive it is. For example he likes going to the cinema but doesn't go so much because he thinks it's expensive. It's not more expensive than going out for a drink, but he doesn't do that often either, for the same reason. He avoids taking cabs. Instead, he walks up to 40 minutes, and our neighborhood is super sketchy during the night. But if 2 more people offer to share the cab, he will take it. It bothers me a bit cause I don't share the same view but I didn't think much of it back then.

The turning point for me, was one month ago. Me, them and some friends went for a 2-day trip. My cousing hardly spoke about money but his girlfriend couldn't stop talking about it. If somebody payed for something, she would immediately do the math and make the rest of us give them our share. It was so stressful that at some point I was close to paying things myself, so that we could skip the whole process of giving change to each other. I think it was happening at least once an hour, for 2 days. 

I am not used to this kind of situation around friends. To me, people that feel close to each other don't spend so much time stressed about money. Usually somebody pays for coffee, somebody else for ice cream etc etc, and in the end we more or less spend the same amounts, and we never get stressed about it. Even if I end up paying a bit more I don't really care, cause I love my friends.

I also want to mention we are all relatively poor. After the trip, me and another friend ran out of money. We laughed about it and I went to her place to make crepes using only water and flour, joking about it and enjoying every moment. I am proud to say my happiness is not depended on if I have money or not. I can enjoy myself either way, and I also love to offer to people close to me.  Despite our general bad financial situation (my whole group of friends live on very little money cause the country is on crisis), only my cousin and his girlfriend act like this. If you ask them they would tell you that anybody could be relaxed about it when they have money, but when they don't it's normal to be tight. That is just an excuse. As I told you, we are all poor but only them act like they can't spare one penny. 

So this is it. I would really like to do something about it, not only because I care about them and I want to show them how important it is to enjoy life, but also because I suddenly feel a distance among us I never felt before.",21Apr2019,1

Through much trial and error, I was able to reintegrate myself into society after spending a year in isolation. I feel like I can keep up with conversations now, I understand what is being asked of me, I've started to come up with witty replies. I've started to lead again, instead of letting others lead me. I've stopped force feeding myself until I felt sick. After 8 months of painful suffering, I'm starting to feel a little normal again. 

What worked for me was using some of CBT. I identified unhealthy habits and thought processes and would put them to a stop. I'd detach myself and rationalize my thinking. I also constantly forced myself to socialize, it helped that I'm in a degree where I'm forced to socialize a lot. Things are slowly starting to come together. I still fall in a pit of despair every week but I no longer dwell on it as much as I used to. I have things I look forward to now.

I have agoraphobia so I cant go very far from my house without having a panic attack. It can be improved with exposure therapy so I'm working on it and I have about a 45 minute radius right now but leaving the house is very uncomfortable for me.
I'm also stuck in a cult. I was raised in a strict religion that excommunicates people who leave. I need to get out of this house but it's hard to leave this religion and the agoraphobia makes this even harder as my options are very limited and I don't even know if i can handle moving. I have no friends and I don't know anybody outside of this cult.
I've been trying to get a job, get some money and build a support system for a long time now but last year my agoraphobia was a lot worse. The past couple months I finally got better enough to handle having a job. I sent in an application and I finally got my drivers license. I was finally feeling optimistic but within 30 days I totaled my car. I was at an intersection and some guy was going 60 in a 25.

105,"it was on a skyblock server, i was able to duplicate mob spawners as much as i wanted thanks to server plugins.

i was casually playing skyblock on that server and while mining a mob spawner i was thinking ""hmmm since theres a plugin on the server that lets me mine and COLLECT spawners (silkspawners) and a plugin that prevent players from mining too fast using speedhack, i wonder if i could trick those plugins into thinking like so : 

antispeedhack : you mined that block too fast! ill replace it !

silkspawners : you mined that spawner ! ill give it to you ! ""

i quickly opened cheat engine and set the speedhack to 100x and it worked !! while i was mining spawners with speedhack, ss gave me spawners while antispeed kept placing the supposed mined spawner while keeping the mined spawner (like a cobble generator)

i then sold duped spawners for 1 ig$(they costed 100K on the shop !!)

then i heard people hating me on the chat because the owner was resetting the server because of me, never felt that much popular xD",21Apr2019,7

108,"I read this under a website, about DSPD and its causes:

""DSPD may cause **excessive** or inappropriate production of melatonin. Serotonin, a mood regulator, is the precursor of melatonin. As a result, increased endogenous melatonin production can deplete serotonin levels and may cause depression.""

Could someone dumb this down for me?

I have a couple questions to: 

1. I thought people who have trouble sleeping have LOW melatonin levels, but then why does it say ""excessive production of melatonin""?
2. How is melatonin and serotonin linked?

Well right as I walk into to the room an ad having something to do with suicide and depression was playing on the tv. I don't think one person in there didn't make a comment about how that person should stop being depressed or just kill them selves already. 

I have been fighting my depression for at least fifteen years, I'm coming to accept it'll probably never end. Still I've been struggling heavily this week, so far the worst this year. Every time I try to reach out it is either ignored or becomes about them. 

I try to power through and be charitable towards others, at least if I fail a few people will have good memories of me.

112,"Laying outside in the sun for the first time this year and enjoying the warm day and smell of hyacinths, I entered a sort of meditative state to explore my thoughts and feelings on Christianity.

Today is Easter. The first thing I noticed was that Easter and Christmas have a very positive mood associated with them. It's more positive than the way I felt at raves, though I can't say I had an especially good time at raves. It may rival the best way I felt doing enjoyable stuff on a beautiful summer day. But I suppose that is learned, and incorporating some of the happiness from early childhood, before my level of well-being declined.

I contemplated the idea of being grateful to God for good things in my life, like the hyacinths. I spent almost no time thinking about blaming God for bad things in my life, like how my well-being declined after moving from Croatia to Canada. Focusing on the good stuff and thanking God for it is certainly a positive mind-state. But that doesn't prove anything.

I thought about whether my life sucks because I kept saying no to opportunities to make it better. Generalizing that, it seems I don't want to make commitments which would involve having to be around people, because of past bad experiences. Instead I prefer to have good experiences on my own, like in nature. But, that's another story.

Then I thought about how there are many different religions. If one religion was true and the others were false, there ought to be some advantage for followers of the true religion. I don't mean necessarily any sort of material advantage, but at least greater peace of mind.

According to some stories, early Christians demonstrated dramatically better peace of mind as they faced death in Roman areas by being thrown to the lions. I heard this impressed other people so much it led to Christianity becoming the official religion of the Roman Empire. But, do I see anything like that right now? Maybe the best example right now are ""Islamic"" terrorist ""martyrs"".  It's a very impressive impressive act of faith to perpetrate a terrorist attack killing others and yourself to try to further your cause, while the vast majority of people think you're doing something evil. But that doesn't seem like a good thing. Even if there was a God behind it, it doesn't seem like a very nice God. I guess it's not out of character for someone who flooded the entire Earth, killing all land animals and humans except those on Noah's ark. Christians don't even see that as an atrocity! That seems like a good reason to reject Christianity. But anyways, probably the peace in facing death comes from the strength of human beliefs, not God. I don't suppose there's any reason to think that God was directly helping early Christians be okay with death just like there isn't any reason to think God is helping terrorists be okay with death.

It seems like the most rational conclusion is that God doesn't seem to be involved in any cause and effect. Yes, religion is powerful, but all of that power can be explained via human beliefs and interactions, without really suggesting the existence of God.

It's probably most important to note that the ultimate effect of such things depends on the nature of those beliefs. Some beliefs can lead to beneficial effects and some can lead to harmful effects.

I don't really have faith that modern society knows what's right either. Things are complicated and humans seem biased toward immediate gratification. I wonder if modern society leads people to leave behind a more fundamental, wholesome and persistent kind of well-being and instead motivates them to seek temporary highs. I suspect religion may be more focused on that more wholesome well-being. But I'm not convinced that it involves God.",21Apr2019,1

119,"Please read this in it's entirety before dismissing it. I have a lot to say to you and I don't want the message to be incomplete.

You know, it's funny, I can remember the exact moment I fell in love with you. It was July 3rd 2018 at around 6:30PM, we were at \*REDACTED\* to see \*REDACTED\*, you were in your lawn chair to my left as I glanced over and looked into your beautiful eyes I fell hard. That day was a perfect day. That day we had so much fun together that we hadn't wanted it to end and despite you having to work early the next morning, so we met up with \*REDACTED\* and \*REDACTED\*, closed the bar, drove around \*REDACTED\* bumping music and then had a wonderful time alone before falling asleep.

The next morning was like a canary in a coal mine falling over dead and signaling that the mine should be evacuated, but I ignored the canary. You were cold to me that morning, you seemed annoyed that I was still there, I felt a bit confused by this as I got in my car. Oh well, what was I going to do to kill time? I was really looking forward to seeing you again when we went to \*REDACTED\*'s that afternoon for fireworks, all I wanted to do was spend time with you. I didn't want to go back to \*HOME\* just to have to turn around and drive back to \*REDACTED\* again later, so I went to a park and slept in my hammock for a few hours, then went about getting ready. At some point, once you'd taken your after work nap, you decided to finally text me back after hours of me waiting to solidify our plans. You were still cold towards me in the text and told me you weren't going to the ranch, you were going with your mother. I wasn't invited. Ouch.

I went on to the ranch alone since I'd already cancelled my family plans and had bought things specifically for the trip to the ranch and I'd already waited in Denison ALL DAY for you so we could go together. ""Where is your girlfriend?"" Awkward thing to answer to \*REDACTED\*'s family.

This was a perfect representation of the entire relationship. There were similar incidences during our short entanglement. It was clear you were keeping me at arms length and not letting me any closer.

The funny thing is that I didn't want to be in love with you yet, I thought it was too soon. Especially after the Fourth of July. You were giving me so many red flags. The problem was that I couldn't control whether I loved you, I could lie to myself and tell myself that I wasn't in love with you, but it was a lie after all.

For a while I resented you for this. The resentment began towards the end of the ""relationship"". (I used quotation marks because you wouldn't commit to anything, which also hurt, btw, but whatever) You had deliberately bailed on plans we'd made over a month in advance and spontaneously decided to get drunk at your friends house which wasn't in and of itself a problem, the problem was that you wouldn't even tell me you weren't coming to meet me, it was like pulling teeth to get you to say that you wanted to bail(you couldn't even commit to being flakey, lol).The other problem was that you disincluded me on a night we were supposed to have a date. You had stood me up again, something I'd never experienced until I met you. That was another slap in the face.

I almost got arrested that night because I was very upset and made poor choices. I'd just spent an exorbitant amount of money to buy us tickets for a music festival as a way to make up for forgetting to buy tickets for a different concert until after you'd already made plans for that night. Ironic that I was so concerned about that while you were flaking on me nearly simultaneously. I had been texting and calling people to try to find a replacement for the trip as soon as you flaked on our plans that night. Unfortunately I couldn't find a friend to take on such short notice. I really wished I had been able to get anyone else to go but I tried to make the best of it anyway.

You were cold to me on a big chunk of the trip to the festival for no reason that I could determine, leaving me to be insecure and wonder if I'd done something wrong, which by this time had become an all too familiar feeling. We left the concert early both nights because you didn't know the headliners and we were tired. We had agreed on these things, but the truth is that I'd have done whatever you wanted and that I actually had wanted to stay the first night. We left early on the last night but it was still late in the evening. You had your nose in your phone or had your eyes closed the whole trip home(5 hours), which was fine, I wanted you to get rest, but it was like you were going out of your way to try to ignore me and be cold. You were curt when with me when we did talk. A rock cracked my windshield and it was all I could do to get you express even the slightest bit of sympathy, as if it were no big deal and I was upset over nothing. When I finally dropped you off I had really hoped that you'd invite me in to go to sleep since it was really late and I was exhausted(HOME IS 45 MINUTES AWAY). I almost hit a deer on my way home that night. Anyone else I've been in a relationship with, even just a friendship, would have most likely invited me in to sleep given the circumstances, but fuck me, right? 

I resented you for all those things and also for that wall between us that I couldn't find a way through. It was partially unfair of me to resent you for that lack of intimacy; partially my fault. I am insecure and never volunteered information about myself. You only just now learned my last name, yesterday. I knew your full name before our first date. I knew a lot about you because I found your Facebook accounts, both of them. I knew you are bisexual and that you'd somewhat recently been in a long term relationship with a girl. I knew all that before I asked you to dinner. I assumed that maybe it was painful or that you didn't talk to me because you wanted to see if I was a homophobe or something. I waited and waited. I tried to be patient and move at your pace. Do you know how painful it is to fall in love with someone who doesn't care to know your name even after a couple of months of a relationship? I was still lying to myself, I couldn't admit to myself that I was in love with you until after we'd hung out disastrously that one last time after it was all over. After that incident I had to be honest with myself about why everything hurt so badly.

We'd agreed to meet up as friends because I'd pushed for it, I was hooked on you despite my better judgement and I wanted my foot back in the door, even if it was in a way that would hurt me. You showed up with a friend, a nice girl to whom you had explained exactly none of our personal history. As soon as I arrived you looked at me in a way that made my heart race, like you still wanted me. Everyone assumed that we were on a date and your friend was actively encouraging me to make moves, even going so far as to physically shove you over to my side. The bar suddenly filled up with people. I needed to get another drink, I'd been drinking slowly all night intentionally. Tall singles. The bartender took an amazingly long time to get my order and when he finally did, he took my money and walked off and was gone again for a truly ridiculous amount of time. When he finally came back he just started bullshitting with people. He'd completely forgotten about my drink. I spoke up and he immediately rectified the situation in the way bartenders usually do, by pouring me a glass of dang-near straight whiskey. I really didn't want a drink that strong but I took it anyway. That was a mistake.

About the time I met back up with you, our group had begun to grow and we switched to pool. You and I were a great team. At one point, as I went to shoot, you grabbed my ass much to my surprise, since I'd been trying to interact on a platonic level all night. You and I had been very flirty but nothing else. This is where that giant whiskey comes into play. My wits were dulled, things started getting blurry for me and later my insecurities started creeping into the back of my mind and causing me to overthink things. Basically I thought since you'd grabbed my ass that maybe I could try a little reciprocal affection. I went to gently put my arm around you. Big mistake. Even worse, I wasn't sharp enough to point out that your reaction was kinda bullshit within the context of you grabbing my ass. Your friend who'd started the evening shoving you towards me was now trying to tell me that you were strictly a lesbian, as if she knew anything about the situation. That was really unfair to both she and I. You should have given her some sort of heads up. The night would have likely gone so much better.

Anyways, this whole situation seemed almost designed to fuck with my head and I became depressed. I hated that I was in love with you. I wanted to not care about you as much as you seemed to not care about me. I'd see a car like yours or someone who resembled you and I'd have a mini-panic-attack. With the exception of a couple of rebounds I haven't been laid since the Tuesday before you stood me up for the last time(is it more sad that I have to specify which time or that it has been that long?). I'm starting to get anger issues from it but I have very little motivation to go out and meet anyone.

When I heard you were going on this trip I nearly backed out. I see you and you act so nice and normal, I enjoy your company, we make nice and have fun, things have been really great, but this entire time there have been two consistent voices in my head. Ones that originally took up residence in there last summer. One really desperately wishes things had worked out, the other wants to tell me you're a terrible person. I don't really believe that you're a terrible person and I don't want to ignore the fact that I'm not perfect and that I did plenty of things wrong. I don't really want to revisit things either but I'm terribly attracted to you and I still love you despite myself. I'm jealous of everyone that you care about and it makes me angry. I'm angry that it still does this to me, I'm angry that I feel like I never had a chance with you, I'm angry that you can give that intimacy and closeness to other people and never gave it to me, I'm angry that I haven't been laid because I don't have the desire to be with someone while I'm damaged(this isn't my only baggage), I'm angry that I'm sure you've never had that problem(I know I'm probably wrong here), I'm bitter and angry. I don't want to be. I don't want to care.

None of this is fair to you. I obviously have complaints about things that I feel are valid, but mostly I just wish I could just be over it. But then I look into your eyes, see you smile or catch the scent of your skin as you move. I'm both attracted to you and not, at the same time. You can't help the way you do or don't feel any more than I can. I didn't write this because I wanted to relitigate the past or to try to persuade you to do anything or feel a certain way, but because I really want to tell you how I feel, I want to talk to someone and feel validated, I want to express myself. Writing this has been therapeutic and if you're reading this, I want to be able to continue on afterwards as if I never said any of this because I don't ever want things to be weird when I am around you. Writing this, organizing my thoughts and presenting them coherently, has made me feel loads better. This is something I have needed to get off my chest so I can move on. I have always had trouble articulating my feelings to you because I had been in denial, so this was a long time coming. If you have anything you'd like to say about all this, I would like to hear it. If not, that is fine too. My goal was to get this all off of my chest, not to make you uncomfortable. This isn't an attempt to rekindle anything or to ""win you back"" and is actually quite embarrassing to reveal, but I feel it is necessary. I also acknowledge that reading this is probably uncomfortable and some of it may piss you off. I'm sorry for that. I don't want to give you the impression that I think your feelings are invalid or that I have told you all this to come down on you and make you feel bad. I'm also not trying to start an uncomfortable conversation while we're trapped together in a car, especially since there are other people in here with us. I just need to be freed from this emotional baggage. Not your fault that I'm having trouble, the fault is my own.

The only question I would have for you would be why didn't you ever even ask my name? Did you really just not care? Is that all it was? Because that is the only answer I can think of that makes sense.",21Apr2019,1
120,"When I first started posting on Reddit, I posted in a Sub, that a regular member was also already posting at.

Whenever I’d submit a thread, or make a comment reply, no matter how innocuous it would be, she’d always go through my (WIDLY varied Post History) and use it against me, trying to start a crusade to get me shunned/banned from the sub where we both posted in.

At one point, she even said (in so many words) *“I’m going to continue to call him out whenever he posts here, until he’s banned”*. 

(Gotta admire her tenacity, if nothing else)
________________________________________________________________________

It actually put me off posting in that Sub, for a *long* time. Because at the time, she was a pretty prominent fixture there, posting a lot, and developing a reputation as a real straight-shooter. So I knew she was on the lookout for me. Literally, whenever I’d post something, she’d say something to the effect of, “*Your Post History is disgusting”*

Can’t really argue with her there, but is it completely necessary to bring it up here, in a Sub that’s completely unrelated to the others I’ve been to? Completely uncalled for.


Sure, I guess I could’ve created a Throwaway, and posted under a pseudonym of sorts, but I really like this profile, and didn’t want her to feel like she ‘Won’ at all. 

________________________________________________________________________

So after laying low for awhile (about 5 months), I took the plunge, and started a thread in the Sub, bracing myself for an attack. Nothing. No attacks from her. I slowly started commenting more frequently there. All good.

I actually started a thread in the Sub, that **she** replied to, and, nothing, I’m happy to say.

Seems like the crusade to take me down has ended. (Until she reads this thread, of course)
______________________________________________________________

Looking through her post history (Yes, I fully see the irony…….) she’s still using her, *“I went through your Post History“* tact as her primary defense against anyone who crosses her. And she’s still a truculent, ‘Know-It-All’ Snob.

But she’s gotten off my Ass thus far, so that’s cool.

(This is where it gets ambiguous) 

The thing is, now I can’t stop looking through her Post History. I’m transfixed with her behavior. She’s SO Damn argumentative, short-fused &amp; haughty, I can’t look away. It’s fascinating going through her posts seeing her get confrontational over the slightest things. Still using the patented, *”I went through your Post History“* as her modus operandi whenever someone gets to her. It’s transfixing.

123,"I've had issues with body image for a very long time. I have a pretty good life and I am trying to become more positive,  but I just can't deal with the constant fluctuating self-esteem. One day my self-esteem will be okay and I will believe that I am pretty. Another day my self-esteem will be horrible and I will be so moody, extremely depressed, and it's just a horrible, horrible feeling. I want to ask people of Reddit what they think of my situation. Is it possible for the people reading this to give me their honest opinion of how good-looking I seem? I don't want to post a picture, but I just want to ask what others think. Because I seem to have experiences that conflict with each other.

First, guys do not snapchat me, dm me, or ask me for my number ever. I have a boyfriend, so I don't care that much. I would never cheat on him and I love him so much. However, when all of my friends snapchat boys 24/7, it makes me feel a little bit discouraged. I mean it's not like the guys who follow my social media know I have a boyfriend because I don't have any pictures of us yet. The guys I see on the streets (when I am alone) also wouldn't know I have a boyfriend. It's super painful when I'm out with my friends and they get more attention than me. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, many strangers have told me I am pretty. There have been many times where random girls will tell me how pretty they believe I am. Sometimes old ladies tell me I have a really nice face. Many guys have called me their ""dream girl."" Once I was at my cousin's sweet 16, and a majority of the guys at her sweet 16 (apparently) wouldn't stop talking about me and how hot I was. I've dated very attractive men in the past. Girls have told me that they wished they looked like me and that they stalk my Instagram all the time. I do not know if I should take these comments seriously because girls may say anything to make other girls like them (I think?) and literally no guys approach me or hit me up so it doesn't add up??  I really have a frame of reference to know if everyone gets told these kinds of things, or if people honestly believe I am good-looking. Obviously, people say these things for a reason, but I just don't know what their reasons are.

I also have really bad social anxiety. I am so awkward and people who do not know me say I have no personality. I am wondering if that could be the cause?

124,"for the last 2(ish) weeks I've been feeling very very happy, weirdly happy for me, and I don't know why. About a month ago I was so depressed I could barely get up of the couch and I was considering giving up. Most my depression probably stems from my trust issues with friends and my inability to tell them what I feel because I'm afraid that they will just get mad at me and stop talking to me. Also the fact that I feel like a backup friend, whenever something goes wrong or a fight breaks out I'm the person people go to, but whenever everything is calm I have no one because all my friends just break off into pairs. I wish I always had someone to rely on. I don't want to be sad again I just want to live a normal life.",21Apr2019,3
125,"My husband and I sometimes have philosophical-ish discussions. Today we ended up talking about how people perceive themselves and their life. Here are the 3 most extreme types we were able to define:

1. The ones who were able to determine who they really are, what are their actual values, and keep being true to themselves in their beginnings.
2. The ones who were pushed by society, circumstance, parents etc. to adopt some values and learned how to live with those and even make others believe this is what they really want. 
3. The ones who wake up every day and don’t really know which direction they are going and what is that they truly believe and enjoy. 

My point of posting it here is to get some statistics on this topic and continue a philosophical-ish discussion with fellow redditors.

129,"A few weeks ago my older brother, who is 24, was diagnosed as a psychopath by a doctor he was sent to see. After my parents found this out they said that if you wanted to continue living in their house he was going to have to go away and get help. After they told him this I had seen noticeable changes in his behaviour. I didn’t think much of it at first until I found a garbage bag filled with a bunch of odd items in his car yesterday while looking for a lighter. 

I found one of those white plastic jumpsuits, multiple pairs of gloves, a metal pipe, and extendible baton, a hunting knife, thick rope, a ball gag, a wig and work boots. All of these items were brand new. 

I am very worried. I haven’t told anybody about this. I don’t want to get him in any trouble but I don’t want to see him hurt anyone. My brother is very charming and good-looking and is easily manipulates women. I seriously fear he is going to hurt somebody but I don’t want to be wrong and get him in trouble. I honestly do not know what to do.",21Apr2019,2

I work at the front desk of a hotel.

So I'm checking in some random guy, probably in his mid 20's. I'm female, for reference here.

Just finishing up checking him in and I'm preparing his key cards when he suddenly says: ""Hey, I'm really flattered, but don't do that"".

I look up from what I'm doing totally confused and say: ""I'm sorry?""

**Guy:** Really, I am very flattered, but I'm married.

**Me:** I'm sorry Sir, I'm not sure what you're talking about to be honest.

**Guy:** (he puts one eye brow up and says) ""The key card packet?""

**Me:** (I'm so confused I honestly don't even know what to say next and just look down at the key cards and back at him)

**Guy:** It's ok, no need to be embarrassed, just give me a new card holder and we'll just go about our day.

**Me:** Honestly Sir, I'm terribly sorry but I seriously don't know what you're talking about.

**Guy:** Your phone number? Really, I mean no offense, you're an attractive woman, no offense at all, but like I said, I'm married and I don't need that kind of temptation in my life.

Then I finally realize what is happening. When I was writing down the password to the WIFI on the key card packet, as is standard procedure here, he thought that I was writing my phone number on it.

**Me:** Oh......actually, what I was writing on here is the password to the WIFI.

**Guy:** (his face immediately turns fire engine red) Oh.

I hand him his keys so he can see and tell him that's the password and he quickly takes them and walks off without another word.

I have a feeling that this is going to be one of those nagging memories that pops into his head just as he's laying in bed trying to sleep.",21Apr2019,30

I matched with this girl from a bad part of town. She messaged me first, so I said something back. Looking back, it wasn’t a good call.

I go to pick this girl up from her house, and I see that this place is on the brink of collapsing on top of her. I can’t judge too much, because I’ve lived in a few questionable homes before, but this place practically made of cardboard at this point in time. I’m thinking this probably isn’t a good sign, but I’m already there, so I roll with it.

She walks out of the house, and I’m moderately disappointed at what I see. I found her on Tinder, right? So I’m not expecting a unicorn, but this girl was definitely guilty of false advertisement. It wasn’t that she was objectively unattractive, she was just abnormally textured. It was as if her skin was aging at twice the speed of her normal body and had a kind of melting quality you might see in a Salvador Dali painting. Shit was weird. We’ll call her Jamie.

Jamie gets in my car and we start making small talk, and everything seems OK. I suggest that we get a drink, and she agrees, but she also wants to grab dinner. I say sure, and ask her where she wants to go. She tells me she wants to go to Denny’s, and I’m like we can do better than that. She responds, almost defensively, and says that she is dead set on Denny’s in a way that I can see there’s no wiggle room .Fine. Fuck it. A drink and then Denny’s. Let’s make it happen.

I’m driving, but I’m unfamiliar with the area so she’s navigating me. She tells me she knows a great place to get a drink, and I’m like if you’re the type of person who’s idea of a date is Denny’s I’m going to need one before we get there, so let’s go. We pass a liquor store, and this girl tells me to pull over. I’m scanning the area for a bar, until it clicks that the place she had in mind was this liquor store. Alright, this is pretty weird, but I’m thinking this girl is just being economical by investing in a bottle. I like a girl, who knows how to save a dollar, so I go in and buy us a bottle of Jim Bean (her call).

We get the bottle and I start driving to Denny’s. I don’t participate in drinking from it, because I’m the one behind the wheel, but Jamie does not play that shit. Before I could shift the car into drive, Jamie was slugging it back, like it was Gatorade. As a result, by the time we got to the restaurant, she was pretty drunk, and I was stone cold sober, so I take a few shots before we head in to catch up.

We get seated, and we’re both feeling good. We order, and this part of the evening is actually kind of nice despite the location. I mean, it’s not like we were discussing philosophy, or anything high brow but the conversation was pleasant. She asked questions about me, and it was all going just fine.

After dinner I’m still feeling a little buzzed, so I suggest that we take a walk. She says she knows a park nearby, Jamie grabs the whiskey from the car, and we head over. We stroll around the park, two mismatched star-crossed lovers. I’m admiring the weather and the sites around me, she’s drinking like it’s the end of the world. So things were going great. She didn’t even seemed phased by the alcohol, and the conversation wasn’t uncomfortable or awkward, and she’s even engaging me physically, so things were still OK.

Once we got back to the car the bottle was gone, but she seems just as sober as me. I’m driving her home through a heavily wooded area, when she tells me to pull over and comes after me like a wild animal. I stop her. I make a point to ask if she’s sure about all of this, that I don’t want to make her feel pressured, that I know she’s been drinking, and she’s insisting that she is fine, and it really seems like she is, so fuck it. I go along with it. And an Act is performed.

After all is said and done, I feel like this was a pretty successful first date, and I thought that she might be on the same page. Then Jamie turns to me and says these words:

“That will be $80.”

An eternity passes in the time between these words and my response. I say, “What?”

She repeats herself.

“Hell no,” I say “That’s not what I thought this was.” Because if I did, I wouldn’t have come, I definitely wouldn’t have paid for her alcohol, and I sure as hell would not have went to dinner at Denny’s!

We go back and forth on this issue for about a minute, until she finally concedes that I’m right, which I was. Then she breaks down. She starts unloading some really heavy shit that’s she’s been carrying around in her head about her home life, abuse, and her issues with drugs, and I couldn’t help but be sympathetic to that. Because as fucked up this situation is, I recognized that she was a person as complex as me, who obviously really needed another human to listen to her. And so I do. I let her let it all out, which is by no means a short tale. This goes on for a few hours. Her talking; me listening to the avalanche of horrible, traumatizingly detailed stuff.

It’s late when the story concludes, and I suggest taking her home. And as we’re driving, perhaps both silently meditating on how much a sudden plunge this night plummeted into, she asks me to pull over at the liquor store to pick up another bottle.

**TL;DR:** Accidentally went on a date with a prostitute.

Edit: Quick note on the drinking and driving portion. There was about a 3 hour gap between the time that I drank and drove again. I felt completely in control of my senses, and would never get behind the wheel if I felt that wasn't the case.",21Apr2019,7
132,"This girl and i are 3 years apart, she is older than me. We were close friends who talked every single day for months and then we stopped suddenly because i changed schools and we ran out of new things to tell each other, were still friends, kinda close but we rarely talk. It was her birthday so we talked and she said how she misses me and how we should meet to talk about everything, suggested to meet in a restaurant to talk and be comfortable and so i agreed.

134,"My last two relationships left me with a wrecked self esteem. I’ve been focusing on me and getting ahead with my life for the past year and a half. I’m in a stable place financially, mentally, emotionally, and physically. I left an abusive living situation, I’m working full time, getting my degree, and I have my own place now. I finally feel ready to date and put myself out there again. I feel like I’ve learned a lot of lessons since my last relationship. My self worth is tied to me and myself only. I make my own happiness. I take care of needs and am self-reliant. I have boundaries I don’t like anyone walk over and I haven’t let myself be anyone’s sole person to rely on for everything.

135,"I’ve been dealing with depression in one form or another for most of my life. I used to be the guy that would always make other people laugh. I loved making my friends laugh and indeed, I loved being surrounded by them but I was always hiding this darker secret of mine. The part of myself that was plagued by suicidal thoughts, the part that saw demons in the dark, and felt things that others couldn’t see. 

I would occasionally break down when I couldn’t keep up the facade. Each break down got progressively worse and I would always isolate myself further. This wasn’t a part of myself to be shared, it’s meant to be hidden, not talked about. Who has the energy to deal with crazy?

I’m writing this because I’m in that place again and I’m not sure how to move forward. After more than ten years I got a more thorough diagnosis. Clinical Depression, Borderline Personality Disorder, elements of Bipolar Disorder, Dissociation. 

Sometimes I think I’m a god. Sometimes I think I am God. Then a week or two passes and I think, no, actually I’m EkpoShinigami, then a few days later I think I’m an angel. 

I feel fundamentally flawed and broken. I haven’t graduated. My last attempt at university ended with me writing about how I am a god, thrice named, but still wanted to kill myself. Cool story but not what was being asked for my Law Of Trusts exam. I remember going for one of my lectures feeling like I was walking with Osiris but in the hall, I assumed the form of a room sized spider. No one but me could see this of course, but it was there. 

I’m deeply afraid of finding work because I don’t know when next I’ll have an episode or think I’m god or God or something else. I don’t trust my mind to remain stable for long enough. 

I’m just so, so tired. I feel broken, and like there’s nothing I can do to fit in or find an adequate flow.  Of course I haven’t shared anything in the previous two paragraphs with anyone, not seriously, not in a way that says “look, I need help” but more in a way that explains why things went pear shaped: “I went to class thinking I was a spider, my mind was elsewhere at the time.”

I’m just really, really tired. Right now I’m isolating myself again; not picking up calls, leaving messages unread. I can feel a distance forming between myself and the few people I’m still close with as I retreat into myself more and more. It feels like I sleep paralysis sometimes.

Picture sitting on a lawn chair, fresh cut grass smell, sun is shining, cool breeze intermittently blowing. Clouds dotting the sky. Kids playing in the yard. I have an ice cold Amber Ale in my hand. To add to the ambiance, I have a hefty cut of pork loin on the smoker and with the scent of apple wood smoke with hints of charcoal drifting past my nose every time the breeze comes through. I close my eyes and just relax. Life is good.",21Apr2019,9
