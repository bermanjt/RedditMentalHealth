0,"Context: I’ve been struggling in school lately. I can’t think straight, I can’t focus, and the material I learn just doesn’t sink in. I can’t find the motivation to get my homework done and when I try to, it’s hard.

Earlier today I texted my mom something along the lines of, “Could you set up an ADHD/ADD screening appointment?” I show several symptoms of ADD. She simply responds, “ok.” Fast forward a few hours. I’m in my room doing homework and she calls me upstairs after we exchange a few texts. She’s sitting on the couch with a pissed off expression. So she starts asking me questions and I can’t remember shit. I try explaining myself and the problems I’ve encountered but she must be more dense than a fucking rock. “You’re overwhelming yourself with technology and your brain constantly needs stimulation,” she says, completely ignoring what I just told her. She blames technology for all of the problems. I’m extremely fed up right now and I feel like punching something. I know something is wrong with me but I don’t know what.",02Feb2019,1
1,"I remember when I was 14 just looking at a woman in a bikini would get me hard. I remember daydreaming about women in bikinis in 9th grade creative writing and having to hide my boner walking out of class after the bell rang. 

Now, at 21, those same thoughts wouldn't even phase me. I watch porn videos and feel nothing unless its something I'm really into like twerking/bootydancing (and even then it has to be a good video) or I'm really horny and haven't jacked off for while. 

In fact, the only thing that gets me that excited again is if I'm about to have sex with a REAL woman. I've tried to simulate having a woman by learning to suck my own dick. After days of stretching and practice, I got far enough to just lick the tip of my head. I then realized if I continued I'd legit have my own in my mouth so I stopped.

I consider this lack of stimulation from porn bad because unless I'm willing to get a girlfriend or a hooker, and I lack the social skills for the former, I have no outlet for my sexuality.

The frustrating thing is I don't and didn't watch that much porn. I did as a teen but who doesn't at that age. After my teen years I jerked it maybe once or twice a week at most. 

I think something is wrong with my sexuality as other men don't seem to have this problem. My friends sometimes talk about jerking off to the latest porn videos or how no-nut-November is so challenging. Meanwhile, last semester I didn't bust for 90+ days - I know because I completed the /r/nofap 90 day challenge. When I started getting closer to day 90 I could feel my prostate randomly pulse for a few times each day (at least I think it was my prostate). After that my urges just died. It was surreal, like I became a Monk. I woke up each day and had no urges throughout the day at all. I think I may have to go 90+ days permanently, wait until I get I girlfriend (which I suspect won't happen until I start making money), or spend money on hookers or Asian Massage Parlors. The latter options are too expensive so I'll just have to go 90+ days again.

4,"(Keep in mind I’m only 21 turning 22, so to you older folk out there, if I sound immature, I’m sorry.)

I think I’ve just about had it with the bullshit. And I’m not talking about life. I’m talking about the people in it.

I find it funny my ex boss who I haven’t worked for in years decides to trash talk me today to a friend. Why? Simply because I have a job! That’s right folks! Good ol’ Hana-Chi has a job! Wait, why is that bad? Oh because my 35 y/o friend can’t get her fucking shit together. Let me tell you a little about the situation so I can explain it better.

It’s her son. He’s the problem. Now, I’m not saying anything bad about disability obviously, because her son is smart. For someone who has a learning disability, he’s normal! He’s good in school, knows right from wrong (sometimes, I’ll get into this in a moment), and can be kind. However, she uses her sons disability as a crutch. Whenever the kid does something wrong, she justifies it as “he’s expressing himself” or twisting words to make it look like you’re attacking her son. One time she got upset with me because I didn’t trust her son around my cats. She got offended when I told her he was rough with them. Obviously she just told me I’m wrong and blah blah blah. She didn’t start getting onto him until she saw it for herself and her boyfriend said something. This isn’t the only issue. She won’t teach him how to be independent. The kid is in 4th grade, almost 10 I believe, and can’t even wipe his own ass. According to her, he’s only a year behind, but still...even a 3rd grader knows how to wipe their own ass. Every time he shits, he needs to take a bath. (Which will bring me to my money point). She lets this child terrorize my cats, she lets him run around screaming, and I just look at her and wonder *”how? How can you sit there and play overwatch and not see what’s going on?”* She doesn’t even discipline this child! He does something bad? She threatens to spank him, not ONCE have I seen this happen! She takes something away for being bad and he cries, she always gives in and gives it back. Like this kid isn’t stupid, and he’ll never learn this way!

But why is he the problem? Lets go forward a month. Now, her boyfriend had run away due to the fact he lied about having a job (for the fucking millionth time). The dude gets drunk and can’t even be honest about having a job. Literally this guy would take her car and go to the Walmart parking lot for 8 hours and lie and say he was at work. Anyway, back to the story. She called me that night, crying, and me being her best friend (at the time) decided to go help her. A week later, me and my boyfriend decided to move in (we were getting kicked out my moms anyway). So her boyfriend comes back, and the same shit happens again. And again. Until she gets serious. He’s stopped for a while and has kept clean and has kept his job. Now, keep in mind the only reason we moved in, is because she couldn’t trust him and she needed the help. Me and my boyfriend always pay on time and have steady jobs, so I wasn’t worried about us. However, as time went by, I realized my purpose for being there wasn’t for help...well not in the money kind of way. She wanted me to be a babysitter. At first it was okay, but as soon as my boyfriend transferred to a new job closer to the house, and my work schedule changed, it became a problem. I told her I couldn’t watch her kid anymore. She was livid! She literally tried to kick me out (legally she couldn’t cause we were on the lease). So this soured our friendship some. Ok, so how does this relate to her son and work?

Well with me not being able to watch her kid, and her boyfriend having the car, she had to switch her schedule to nights again. (7-12?) So, from what she’s told me, her boss was pissed and only gave her 20 hours. She quit. And now I’m like wtf?

This brings me to our money problem.

Lately she’s been stressed out because she’s depressed and can’t do anything for herself or simply “take her kid to the zoo.” But in my mind, I think it’s bullshit. It’s bullshit because she’d rather spend $40 on cigarettes every few weeks and buy weed rather than save that money to take her kid to do shit. She’d rather buy fast food when she has food stamps! She could save that money to take her child somewhere if it bothers her that much! Anyways, that brings me more into the money issue. I think me and my boyfriend are going to be expected to pay more...but I’m not agreeing to it. When my bf was out of a job for a bit (while transferring), I had to cover his share. So if she can’t get rent together, why do I have to pay more to cover her? The agreement was my bf and me were my responsibility just like her and her bf was her responsibility. The bills have gotten a bit higher, but that’s because I firmly believe they leave the light on all the time and her sons tv on all hours of the day, and the kid has to take baths after every shit. I usually go to my moms to shower and my bf takes 5 mins so I know it isn’t us. We are barely there and yet it seems like we are at fault.

Just the other day she told me to clean up after myself. Ironic thing is, I always clean after myself. Her and her boyfriend always leave out coke cans and food.

Another thing, she’s been doing this every week. I always either hear her talking to her boyfriend about it, or something, but she literally blames everyone around her for her life being shit. I think that’s childish. I don’t go around blaming my mommy and daddy because I can’t pay my credit cards or I don’t have gas/food money for this certain day. But this girl, oof, does she go around and point fingers at everyone.

I’m ready to move the fuck out. I hate it here. And I’m not trying to be negative but this is too much for one person. I shouldn’t have to be made to feel bad for having a job. I shouldn’t be talked bad about because I can’t do things for a kid that isn’t even my responsibility. I should’ve be threatened out of our shared home because I need to make money to keep our place and from getting evicted. Idk I just feel I did nothing wrong.

P.S - Am I wrong for suggesting she should give her child up to the father? Like I said, she was crying and saying how she wants a better life for him (because apparently not getting him everything he wants is a shitty life for a child?) And was debating on giving him up. She said she can’t live without him but she feels bad because he sits in his room and she can’t afford daycare or anything. I told her idk. I mean she gets child support ($400 a month) and while he’s a shitty dad, he is still giving something. Idk how much a 10 y/o disabled kid cost, but she has food stamps and a working boyfriend too. And us helping her with rent and utilities. So I don’t know why she is complaining. I mean we’ve all been there before where we have struggled. It’s life. I’m 21 and even I know that.",02Feb2019,1

6,"So I’m having a good day, for the first time in a long time my ex wasn’t the first thing on my mind when I woke up. Shits going smoothly. Then next thing I know, i wake up from a nap with two texts from my ex’s best friend, calling me a piece of shit for “sending people” after my ex. Apparently someone I chatted to on imgur and got advice from, starter inboxing my ex some nasty abuse and calling her a slag and what not. 

Anyone who knows me knows I come from a law enforcement family and know the law. I’m not sending anyone to harass someone, that’s stupidity. Additionally, instead of contacting me yourself, you have your friend come at me like a petulant child with insults? “If you loved her you wouldn’t do that” el oh fucking el. The same could be said for a lot of shit your best friend did to me. That said, I’ve never once intentionally hurt her or sent anyone after her. I myself have actually been stalked across several platforms for the past year and have two existing police reports, so accusing me of doing this when I was receiving abuse way before you, is quite laughable. 

Lastly, I’m actually glad she did message me. I learnt that apparently my ex has been lying about me to her friends and family saying I cheated on her and threatened to kill myself to gaslight her. Essentially projecting things onto me that I never did. It honestly adds up now why everyone was being so toasty at the end. Why do people do that? Why make yourself look like an angel at others expenses?  It’s shitty.",02Feb2019,1

I'm just posting this because of the whole anti-Facebook rhetoric I see on Reddit as of late, esp. in the more tech-centric subs. But to me, it still has value.

10,"Sorry if I make any mistakes, english is not my first language.

I just wanted to tell my love story, to get out of my chest i guess (?)

I am a Brazilian girl, 19, when i was 14 i met a guy, he became my best friend and 6 months later my first boyfriend too, our relationship lasted 3 years, he was the first boy i actually truly liked and wasn't just a crush, i really love him but I was so insecure a the time and would fight often with him about stupid stuff

he broke up with me on 2017, and it hurt me more than anything, 1 month later a started to focus on myself and started to feel better, than i meet him and he wanted to get back together, i accepted it cause i still loved him, he even cried in front of me for the first time in 3 years and I was really touched.

2 days later he said it was a mistake and we just stopped talking, then 2 weeks later he was in a serious relationship with a girl

this hurt me so much cause in my mind he would never do such a thing, I thought he respected me and cared at least a little bit to not make such a thing as getting back with someone just to use them and  'throw away"" later

after it i got really bad anxiety cause my family would say things like ""not even your boyfriend wanted you anymore"" (my mom has some problems so she acts really mean towards other people), while he was dating the other girl he would contact me sometimes through a fake Facebook account, this also made me really sad cause he was texting really ""flirty"" stuff, i spent my Christmas sad and anxious, just crying because it didn't seen like it was real, he used to have such strong personal values, he was someone I admired so much. 

in 2018 I spent some time in my grandmas house, i felt much much better when i was there, she is so sweet and i can talk about anything with her without receiving mean comments as a response, when i came back home my dad said we were all moving to Portugal, cause he had a good work opportunity, i got really happy, even though it would be harder to get into college it was still a good thing, my country isn't really safe and after being mugged I was really scared to go out and do things. 

thats when my ex contacted me again, he sent a friend request on facebook and a apology text, i ignored it cause it didnt seem genuine, then he said that he still liked me in a ""weird way"", i told him to stop doing this when he has a girlfriend and he just ""oh but i dont have a girlfriend anymore actually""

so the dumb ass me from the past thought ""omg he likes me i cant believe it "" 

we started talking a lot, in a very friendly and cute way, i was so so happy, i dont even understand why but just talking to him and being his friend made my days. 

i told him i was moving to portugal and he was happy for me, but then he got the brilliant idea of ""getting back together in your last month here, to have better memories than the ones we had from the previous break up"", i did not accept it and said we could be friends and nothing more, but as the days passed i got myself corresponding his ""flirty"" way of texting. 

He invited me to go to the movies watch infinite war and i accepted it, he was so sweet and cute and it all felt like nothing had changed since 2015, i remember just looking at him and being so happy that i cant even explain.

next week i was at my grandmas again spending the week with her to tell about going to portugal, when i came back to my city he asked me to go to the movies again, we watched deadpool 2 this time, we kissed during the movie and i didnt really think about the past and the bad things, or the fact that i was moving and that he knew it, i was just dumb and happy at the time. 

when the movie ended was really late and i had to use all my money to get a taxi just to get there cause   
public transport was on strike, so i went to his house sleep there, deep inside i know  i wanted it, i missed his family a lot, his grandma was really kind to me and i was still good friends with his brothers wife.

i spent 2 days there, everything was great, we played the games he made together and his family was kind to me as always, one week later he got a 10 days exchange to the USA, he sent me a lot of pictures and i could just think about how i wanted to see those places with him one day, in my head it would definitely happen  cause we were """"""destined to each other""'""  

in the last days of his exchange we didnt talked at all, he was very busy, when he came home  we still barely talked too, i saw on instagram that he had created an account and was following like 10 people, one of them was a girl who was with him in a lot of group photos on USA. 

i didnt text him anymore , i was feeling insecure again since he was leaving me on read, my dad was going to portugal first to prepare everything (our new house, visa) so i was going to stay in brasil for at least the next 3 months. 

me, mom and sister went to spent the last 3 months in grandmas house, i was happy to be there, i even got close to a lot of new people too, but then just to see his picture on fb chat i got all anxious and confused, i made him promise to me that he was not going to just stop talking all of the sudden again but he did, i saw his profile on ig again and he was in a relationship with the girl (the one in the group photos), i got so anxious, i just cried and had a lot os panic attacks during that time, i would say to myself a lot "" this is to weird to be real, he is not this kind of person"" event though he never actually lied, he said he only wanted to be together for a short period of time, but i was so hurt by it, even now it still hurts me a little.

now he is living with the girl in a very big city, he seems really happy and when i see his smile in instagram i can do nothing but get happy for him, i hope he can now know how it is to love someone deeply.

he recently started following me and my drawing account, he was the one who encouraged me to draw the most, i didnt really cared that much about drawing but he was so supportive of it that made me want to get better, now when i draw i often think about him, it makes me happy to know that he is going to see it too on ig later.

i guess i still love him in some way, not the person that he became, but the sweet guy  i met on 2014.

I dont know what to say anymore but i am feeling much better and not so sad after writing so much.  ",02Feb2019,1
11,"I am not pro-life myself, but I grew up as pro-life, around pro-life people. I know the vast majority of them mean well. However, the talk I'm hearing and seeing from people I respect regarding late-term abortions and the laws in New York and Virginia is bothering me immensely. They're always repeating talking points from right-wing propaganda and pro-life web sites. 

Some of these outlets and web sites are well-meaning, some are malicious. Both are misrepresenting the issue of late-term abortions. 

Late-term abortions are tragedies that are not performed on viable babies.

Late term abortions occur when it is found that a baby will be unable to live outside the womb because of extreme birth defects like missing a spinal column, missing half of a heart, missing an aorta, the baby's brain is on the outside, etc. 

Late-term abortions are the worst day of a mother's life.

If a mother cannot carry a viable baby to term late in her pregnancy due to the mother's life being in danger, THEY DO NOT ABORT THE BABY. They do everything they can to save the baby.

Late-term abortions are *never* about convenience.

Late-term abortions should be the *least* controversial type of abortion, not the most.

If you are pro-life, please take some time to educate yourself about what the other side actually believes. These laws are meant to preserve the ability of a woman and her doctor to make life and death decisions regarding the life and death of a pregnant woman, without interference from the State.

It's only resulted in embarrassment. I don't respond like I should to social situations. I've been speaking out for months now and I haven't improved. If I have it's been extremely minimal.

I just got done crying about some dumb things I did today in front of my new professor, which he noticed and called me out on. But he took it the wrong way. I'm just socially inept and easily misunderstood. I feel like my brain works slowly and I can't tell if it's because I've always been this way or if the year I took off life from depression is what's affected me.   My friends call me out on stupid things I say too and it sucks it's so embarrassing. At least they understand why I do the things I do. It just sucks because sometimes I feel they get irritated with me. 

I get so easily overwhelmed with social things or sometimes with information that I feel like I shut down and get tunnel vision. I'm so easily stressed out. This is something I've always had trouble with. Why does this happen to me?? Sometimes I don't notice anything around me. I don't realize things as quickly. I'm not as sharp as my classmates and it shows. I feel like restarting my fucking life. Sometimes I want the earth to swallow me whole! 

I've tried improving how I eat, exercising, making a list, deep breathing. All in attempts to clear and organize my head and calm down my anxiety. I try to tell myself ""it's in the past"" when I fuck up. But the more confident I get the more I mess up and I end up regressing. I drop everything healthy I picked up and go back to unhealthy methods for comfort. I lose confidence and become quiet again. Then have to make myself push forward again because I have no other choice. But then I become confident and embarrass myself. It's just a self-sustaining cycle. 

I was seriously thinking today about my future. I've always wanted to find love and become a wife with 2-3 children. I love kids! But today for the first time when I though about my future realistically so far at 22 years old...I feel like I won't find anyone. And I won't have kids. Maybe I shouldn't even have any.

18,"Just in case you got confused by the title, it is not about the usual drug. It is the drug that we like to call 'the internet'

Long story short, I used to have amazing patience and attention span. And maybe had that to do with me never having a phone (still dont have one). 

But things changed in 2015. I got introduced to two sites and got deeper into a third one. As I got a school computer my friends were quick to show me Reddit. I also opened up usage of Twitter to post stuff of LBP. And I delved deeper into the shelves of Youtube at the same time.

It didn't take long for me to become totally addicted.

You know, once upon a time I actually were doing... things. Fun things. I used to play a lot of games, draw comics and film stupid videos I would never show to anyone.

But all those things have declined. I have completely removed myself from making any type of videos and instead were watching others on Youtube. I also went away from drawing comics reguraly to never and instead maybe, *maybe*, make 1 drawing on the computer instead each month. And games, what about games that didn't go wrong. I used to play a TON of games and made some genuienly great memories from them. Now, I'll maybe play a game if I really feel like it, and then its probably minecraft or smash bros as I dont have the passion to start one of the new games I've been collecting for the past 3 years.

But here is the problem; I just simply *can't* delete any of my account on these social medias. I just *can't* hinder myself from checking up on them atleast once a day. A day can start with me checking up on reddit in the morning and then continue untill I need to force myself to close reddit before going to bed. And I know this is bad, but I just can't quit it. I am absolutely obsessed with anything that counts as personal story for me, so deleting the account would be to delete a part of me. 

I also can't delete twitter either. While it isn't as personalified as reddit, it would mean to remove myself from the world of other game communities. I would be lost. Lost in the void.

And Youtube is probably the worst. Because  I really do adore some of the content I watch on youtube. I laugh a lot. but I also endlessly brose a lot. And knowing that I've spent 5000 hours on youtube I can easily say that not even a fifth of that time were well spent.

I can't remove myself from these parts of the internet and its making me miserable. I can't go to sleep in time (its already 5 am when I am typing this) I can't get motivation to do other stuff (which I had a lot of before) and I generally feel so bad that I can see myself in people with depression. 

And yet I need to click that orange message box in the corner of this website.

And yet I need to click the obnoxious sea blue number on twitter.

And yet I reload my sub box every half a hour on youtube.

So a couple days after I posted, I decided I would move out, regardless of what might happen because of it. I felt I didn’t need a roommate who was never there and never cared. The roommate that’s my friend would stay in touch for sure, so I felt ok with my decision. 

About a month ago, my friend asked me if I would want to room with her next year without the other roommate. I was overjoyed and said yes. We are now starting to make decisions on an apartment. 

Last week, the other roommate (over text) asked us whether or not we wanted to renew the lease. Neither of us replied because we figured it would be best discussed in person. She forced our hand though when a couple hours later she just sent ???. I told her I would’ve preferred to have told her in person but no I’m moving out. Then, my friend was forced to tell her. 

Now, she’s acting childish and won’t talk to us. She scampers away when we say something directly to her. I want to feel bad, but it’s almost a little funny. After all she put me through, which included supporting my ex every time (which also meant isolating me from all my friends), it’s really hard to feel bad. I hope that doesn’t make me a shitty person. ",02Feb2019,1
26,"It hasn’t even been an hour. Dear god how bad this shit fucking hurts. And the fact that it came out of fucking nowhere is goddamn insane. She was literally telling me she loved me two hours ago. Everything was perfect.

When I love someone, I love the fuck out of them. Like, not a minute goes by when I’m not thinking about them. Yes, that shit is dangerous as fuck. And I have tried so hard to keep my guard up as long as I can, but eventually that person is able to find there way in. And then this.

I can’t even explain it, man. My entire body just went into shock lol. Panic attack, mind racing. I’m starting to feel less and less now, but I fear this is just my body quarantining these emotions rather than me actually rationalizing them. 

I guess the most painful thing is feeling you aren’t good enough. I’m mature enough to KNOW I will get over this, but man does this burn. Bad.

I just need someone to talk to. This helped a little. Thank you guys. ",02Feb2019,1
27,"No more people putting me down, I want to be the best.

My life has done a full 180 and I have some pretty great people to thank for that. A year ago I couldn’t have even imagined to be where I am now.

Now I’m going to spend another year being even better than before.",02Feb2019,1
28,"So I’m having a good day, for the first time in a long time my ex wasn’t the first thing on my mind when I woke up. Shits going smoothly. Then next thing I know, i wake up from a nap with two texts from my ex’s best friend, calling me a piece of shit for “sending people” after my ex. Apparently someone I chatted to on imgur and got advice from, starter inboxing my ex some nasty abuse and calling her a slag and what not. 

Anyone who knows me knows I come from a law enforcement family and know the law. I’m not sending anyone to harass someone, that’s stupidity. Additionally, instead of contacting me yourself, you have your friend come at me like a petulant child with insults? “If you loved her you wouldn’t do that” el oh fucking el. The same could be said for a lot of shit your best friend did to me. That said, I’ve never once intentionally hurt her or sent anyone after her. I myself have actually been stalked across several platforms for the past year and have two existing police reports, so accusing me of doing this when I was receiving abuse way before you, is quite laughable. 

Lastly, I’m actually glad she did message me. I learnt that apparently my ex has been lying about me to her friends and family saying I cheated on her and threatened to kill myself to gaslight her. Essentially projecting things onto me that I never did. It honestly adds up now why everyone was being so toasty at the end. Why do people do that? Why make yourself look like an angel at others expenses?  It’s shitty.",02Feb2019,1
29,"Posted in r/advice also. 

I (F22) have been around my father (59) a lot since November 2017 because we both ran into major health complaints. I had just broken up with my long term boyfriend and he had nowhere to go except my mother (his ex wife's) home. He has a huge problem with her because he spent years building the family home, but my mother still told him to leave years ago. He actually knocked down the previous house that was in my grandmothers name at the time when my mother took me out of town to visit said grandma without asking if he could or telling anyone about it. The land/house wasn't in my mothers name for 7+ years after this once my grandma died. Her 5 siblings weren't happy about any of it. My mother and I arrived back and the house was gone. My father always claims my mother just wanted the new house built and he wasted his years, but my mother just says she never wanted the house to be this big in the first place and never knew about it, and told him not to stress himself building a huge house. Anyways. Things have been difficult health-wise for us both and in every other way to say the least. But in this time I've become aware of what an asshole he truly is. I always knew he was slightly racist/homophobic but dear god. I do excuse some of it because he was been so unwell, but other things there isn't any excuse for. This is the first time he hasn't been at work 24/7 since he was 16 and it's really getting to him. 

For example, he told me a gay man and his partner were behind him in a food store. The man pushed some of his food forward to make room for his own, and he said he wished he had a gun on him that day, because he would have shot' the n-word faggot if he had a choice'. 

Since he is ill, he is on disability but it took a while for it to come through. In an appointment he had to attend to qualify for it, he seen some people who were also waiting to go in. He then went on a verrry loud rant so they could all hear, with my mother and I sitting there about all the 'n-words and disgusting foreigners that were getting in ahead of him' he also said he'd like to shoot a child of a young couple that was waiting there who was sitting in a stroller.

We are not American, we live in Central Europe in fact he has never been to America, yet he loves Donald trump and has called him his hero. Before Christmas, he wanted me to order a trump t-shirt for him online. He thinks Trump is 'the man'.


Any time a gay couple/gay person comes on the tv he talks about how they're a faggot and a poof. He is so bitter and begrudges everyone of anything they have. He has a problem with everyone and everything. Because his life is a disaster he hates that anyone has money because he has no savings although he worked for a lifetime. He did run into seriously hard times in life, but I mean, so did I so did my mother, were not behaving like him.

I didn't want to listen to it one day when he was making a negative comment about gay people and going on and on about SJWS. All I said was that he was a racist homophobe. He then proceeded to shout at me and act as if I had said the most insulting thing in the world and he said how dare I accuse him of being 'scared of gay people' that he isn't scared of them, only disgusted by them and he wasn't surprised that I was 'taking their side' because there's 'no loyalty' left in the world today and that no one ever did him a good turn in life.

He was always depressed/contrary but since my mother had a mental breakdown (understatement) back in 2010 and they split up, he has been on a downward spiral. My mother is crazy but has a good heart and means well. My dad always supported me financially before he got sick, and we were in regular contact. I appreciate everything he has ever done for me but he's a horrid person. 

Everything is always about him, he never has anything good to say about anyone. He lives in the past and is obsessed with living in the past. He makes obvious mysoginstic comments then denies it. He never stops talking about all the wrongs his family especially his mother did him as a child and teenager. He makes fun of people's appearances and can't bear overweight people. Especially overweight women. He constantly talks about history, facts he knows about history and quietly acts like I'm stupid if I haven't heard of what he's talking about. 

Its not that im a big LGBTQ supporter, im not a feminist im not an all-loving angel I'm not painting myself out to be that. I just have absolutely no problem with how others choose to live their lives. I'm just wondering how others would react to it/what you'd do? I'd never be here around him if it wasn't for the state of my health: Thanks. ",02Feb2019,1

While initially strangers, I was able to briefly get to know them and have such a good time. I've been in a weird space emotionally as of late so I cherish these moments of joy. I just loved how beautiful their personalities were. People are just so dynamic and unique and I absolutely love that!

44,"It started two weeks ago when I got the GI bug that's going around. It went on for about 5 days, I couldn't keep anything down and I was living on the toilet. I couldn't even lay down to sleep  I'd have to get up and run to the bathroom . The 4th night of this I decided to go to urgent care, to see if they could do anything for me. They gave me some meds for nausea but basically said I just got to have to tough it out keep taking Imodium and eat some bananas 'too stuff you up'.

Well it worked, it stuffed me up for 2 days which didn't surprise me since I didn't eat much for the last week. On Monday I took a small dump, nice and solid even hurt a little. Wednesday I started getting pain that's when I realized I was stuffed up bad, I ended up trying to dig it out. It didn't work well and I went to the store when they opened and got some laxatives and stool softener. As Thursday came and went I still wasn't going so I went back to the store and got an enema kit . Now Friday is here and I want to end this pain,  there was a block of s*** in my rectum that wouldn't let anything pass.
 
Well the enema kit worked, I needed to refill it a few times with some warm water to get things moving. I cannot believe how much it hurt, I still had to go digging with a gloved hand but I think the plug is all gone now. There were screams of pain, I screamed in pain it hurt so much. I could hear my dog scratching at the door so concerned they were crying. It is now 2 a.m. on Saturday and I have finally taken a good shit without wanting to scream out. I know I still have a backlog of shit but I think I'll be okay.
 
As bad as living on the toilet and not being able to keep anything down was when I had the GI bug, being constipated was worse. Maybe if I had realized I was getting constipated sooner it wouldn't have been as bad as it was, but this was a first for me. But I hope to God it's the last.

I’m weird. Like. I work and go to school. I drive and I take care of myself. But I have a pile of stuffed animals. I have loads of Nintendo brand video games (Nintendo’s? For a lack of better words), and cutesy toys. And enamel pins omg. I have a retail therapy problem. 

I would say I’m “normal” in the way I look and present myself to the world. But I’m just awkward and goofy and just plain weird. I’m shy and quiet too.

Sometimes I worry if/when he gets reminded of how weird I am because what if he thinks it’s uncool??? Because he’s so cool.

He’s calm and chill. He’s so sure of himself and who he is. He just goes with the flow. He just lives his life as it is. He’s also pretty mature and he can be so relaxed. I always make his talk on the phone whenever we have to get takeout or something. 

And then there’s me, an anxious and awkward bean who overthinks everything.

I feel so silly fussing over this so much because it sounds like something a high schooler would worry about. But I just worry. 

I wonder if he even likes me once he continually finds out that I’m a weirdo. Or if he’d rather be with someone who’s more like him. Or be with someone who was easier to be with.

I’m a handful. 

He says he’d rather be with a weirdo than a normie, but people don’t usually like my brand of weird. He never makes me feel ashamed for who I am or is mean to me about my personality or looks.

51,"Reddit is a big part of my life, and I'm happy for all the different experiences it has given to me. So, whether or not anyone reads this, I needed to put this on reddit somewhere, because the site has actually helped me a lot. When I'm at my highest highs and lowest lows, the wonderful people on reddit have been there alongside me.

In the past 348 days, I have:

* learned about ASMR and fall asleep/study to different channels every day and night
* found a community, both in real life and on reddit, informing me about ADHD, receiving my diagnosis on June 8th, 2018 and thus kick-starting my road to self-improvement
* found YouTube channels that I love so, so much (nakeyjakey, Ephemeral Rift, Funhaus, Internet Historian, SovietWomble, TierZoo, LEMMiNO, videogamedunkey, and so much more)
* received interior design advice for my college rooms so my triples (both this year and last year) have been spacious and looked great to me
* learned about different techniques to keep me focused on the important tasks in my life (hygiene, to-do/ta-da lists, cooking, charity when I have excess, studying, going to classes and work, etc.)
* started reading books about Western and Eastern religions/philosophies to try to understand which viewpoint I hold on the universe and which values I want to stick to in order to feel good about myself
* became self-sufficient enough to pay for my own rent, groceries, food, school supplies, household materials, and everything else except my tuition (thank you dad for your service, it's paying for my time here at the university and I love it, and I am very grateful to be here!)
* got closer to my mother and father, my 2 brothers, my sister, and my extended family, and I am able to let them know why I can't communicate/show my love and affection like they do (even though I love them very very much)

And there's loads more that I am inevitably missing here. The last year has definitely hit me with some hard hits: I failed classes, I lost family members, I had fights, bad days, sick days, and plenty of other difficult things to deal with. But now I have the resources to deal with it, and that's my friends, family, medical staff and medication, and not least of all, reddit.

This website has its toxicity, but I really can't thank the people here enough for their help. Great people put their life and soul into the posts and comments here all the time, and even those that had their bad days on here recover and post wonderful things that have drove me to better myself and the ones I love and meet every day. Much of the beautiful things I didn't even comment on, just lurked and saw it happen, but it really was beneficial.

I'm likely deleting my account in 2 hours (if I don't forget to do it), but even if no one comments I was able to put this up on reddit somewhere and put my appreciation for this website in some place. Thank you all, and I hope you have a wonderful day. Love you &lt;3",02Feb2019,1

At the end of the day, upvotes/downvotes don’t matter at all - there are so many more important things to be concerned with but it is annoying when you start feeling like you can’t post or comment with complete freedom cause it might not be reddit-y enough.

61,"My SO and I are both military. We work in the same unit, different offices, but see each other all the time because the unit is tiny and everything we all do is intertwined. 

Sometimes one of us has weekend duty, so we get to pick days off during the workweek to make up for it (we call them CTO's, or compensatory time off). My SO and I generally spend all of our time together-- we live together, work out together, carpool to/from work together... we have a running joke that we're only apart when we're in the bathroom (and that isn't even always the case, haha). But, it's basically true. 

Now, he's my best friend in the world. Our biggest argument is over who loves the other more. We actually turned it into a game-- whoever says ""I love you most"" first in a day, wins, and they decide which of us is the most amazing, sexy, awesome, sweet, funny, etc., within the relationship (and, regardless who wins, it's always the other person who is the most \[insert anything good\]). Generally, I hate missing out on time together away from work. But honestly, when we have those unfortunate, sporadic weekends where he has to work and I stay home, I actually love it. 

Not because I like the alone time (honestly, I'm cool with that, and it is nice to have some time alone with my pets and the house), but mostly I love him being away because I like to CLEAN. 

I hate spending our time together cleaning the house. I would rather just relax with TV or play video games. When he's around, and we're doing a video game play-through together, I drag my feet to get cleaning done. But if we're not into a thing at the time, I'll eventually get bored during a day off, and I'll clean or do something productive. But I actually start to feel bad because, since he doesn't jump to his feet to join me, he thinks that I think he's lazy. But I don't feel that way at all; I just boredom clean. I feel silly asking him to do things because I honestly would prefer to just do it myself, since I'm generally not doing anything better if it comes up. And he's usually enjoying his time off of work doing things!  He plays video games or breaks out his guitar and plays for me or he pulls out his drawing pad and makes beautiful art-- he just always comes up with creative things to do with his time. And since I enjoy cleaning, it makes sense that I just do it when I have nothing better to do. I somehow still feel guilty about it. 

But, when he's gone at work, I spend hours cleaning the house, guilt-free, knowing that he's stuck at work and I'm here so I may as well get a bunch of stuff done. It's AMAZING. And, I feel good knowing that when he picks his days off during the week, when I'll be at work, he doesn't have to worry about cleaning anything. He can enjoy his time off with video games and drawing and reading and playing music and relaxing.

This weekend is one of those weekends. I cleaned each room, I did all of the laundry, and the huge stack of dishes in the kitchen. I took care of the garbage and all of the recycling. I took breaks here and there, but it felt so good to get it done, and know that he won't have to worry about it at all next week. I left myself a couple of things to do for tomorrow, but mostly, the house looks amazing and I feel so happy that he gets to come home to a clean house.

My love language is a healthy balance of most of the types, but by a small margin, acts of service is my number one language. I LOVE when I come home from work on one of his CTO days and he says, ""Babe, I cleaned the kitchen for you!"" and it makes me so happy. But even more than that, I love cleaning the house for *him*. 

It's kind of silly because in previous relationships, I always found it to be a huge drag to always be picking up after my SO's. But therapy made me realize that it wasn't the cleaning that I found cumbersome, it was the fact that I wasn't satisfied in my relationship otherwise. My previous SO's both had low libidos, or they never worked and just spent all of my money, or they were just giant buttholes to me. Basically, they were giant fucking anchors. But my current SO (and, hopefully, forever SO) makes me feel so loved and happy that I get a great deal of joy out of cleaning so that he doesn't have to. I just want to do whatever I can to make him feel special and loved and important, because he is the most important thing to me.

62,"So, yeah. More like since autumn started (colder weather - November) I started getting sick/the common cold. At first I got it like 2 times in a month and I thought that's about it, but it's still happening. 

I usually eat a fruit a day and meat. I wash my hands often because I also have contact lenses, and avoid people coughing and sneezing... But still, I get it super often.

To put it in time, on 16, 17, 18 January I missed school because I felt like shit. Now it's 2 February and I feel like shit again. My nose is stuffed and I sneeze sometimes. At least my colds are never longer than a week (which I'm thankful for)but it's still bad that I get it super often.

I chose one from Thailand as I was curious about asian women and I had also heard that they can give good massages which I wanted as well.

When I went to her appartment a different woman than I had expected opened the door but she also looked fine so I didn't think much of it.

I only realized that a mistake was made when I saw her penis, but by that time I had allready payed and was sitting on her bed completely naked. When I pointed out that she wasn't the woman I expected to meet she offered to give me my money back but I wanted to continue. So we continued.

70,"This is going to be long and im sorry for it being so. I'm not going to go into super specifics.

I think the best place to start is in October. My sister passed away from cancer and it hit me hard. I've always had the idea to hold it in until the pain has passed. Don't do that. This post is mainly about my relationship but that's relevant. 

My girlfriend is bi polar and she has periods of ups and downs. Directly following my sister she went into an extreme down. She's always been depressed and honestly I got used to her cycling and hoped it would pass. I am like completely devoted to her. So she pulled away and set up our extra room as her bedroom and never came out. Would be distant and eventually told me she wanted to try being separated for awhile. I didn't like this, but I thought she needed space to figure things out. 

Moving ahead to about a month ago she says that she needs to change everything. She flies a few states away to see a guy she's been talking to for a long weekend. Nothing happens with them physically, just emotionally. I know she's being honest. She is a great person. But to me, everything was going to go back to normal and it jolts that shit is all fucked. I know I shouldn't have been distant, I should've told her everything I told her later before. 

So I lost it. Like emotionally. I'm not violent or anything and I would never yell at her, that's not what I mean. Like super depressed and crying and racing thoughts like im a crazy person. We have been together 13 years. My entire adult life and now the life I thought was good is gone. She came back and we live together. I can't stop thinking about her and telling her I want her back and like im not going into detail but I'm going crazy. Like it feels so bad. It feels like my heart is broken and all my emotions leaked into my chest and it's like a physical weight in my chest. She said that this life reminds her of bad times when we drank and had depression, she needs to leave out behind and im part of that. I didn't think people could feel this bad from emotions. All I want to do is lay in bed. I wake up crying from a dead sleep at 3am. I cry at work and break down at every song I hear. I've been taking to walking around just to get out of the house and always end up at my childhood home crying on the porch. 

She's been great though. I know she feels guilty and she's trying to comfort me that it has to be like this. But does it? I'm not the life we had. I changed, I grew up. That was a different person. We're going to lose our house, our dogs. My love. It's hard to imagine being this committed and her just not. 

I have no support system and when I think of things she's the only one I can tell things to but then it starts a series of conversation loops. Like I literally can't think of anything but her. I know how we got here and I know how to change things but you can't change how a person feels. I ultimately want her to be happy, I'm not holding her against her will. I just want a chance to try to make it right. I can't even have a chance. But she says we had 13 years to change things. And she's right. I am seriously like an emotional wreck. I am dealing with more than that and I really need someone. 

I'm trying to pursue things to take my mind off of it but this really is the end of my life. That life anyways. I have to start an entire new life by myself and the only thing I want is for her to hold me and tell me it's going to be okay.",02Feb2019,1
71,"I'm writing this from an alt just to get this out of my head.

I'm a guy, and I just turned 31 recently. I suffer from anxiety and depression, and although I'm on medication, I still have my fair share of bad days. I've been single for a couple years now, with my last relationship ending, because I wasn't in love, and I didn't want to keep leading her on. When we broke up, I was overweight, burned out at an unsatisfying job, and just hated my life. In the past year, though, I've made huge improvements to myself. I've lost 60lbs, and I'm now in the best shape I've ever been. I started on the medication, which I believe has saved my life. I'm also more social, and spend more time talking and being with family and friends. 

But I'm still lonely. My anxiety makes it difficult to open up to new people quickly. This makes dating really hard for me, and meeting people at bars nearly impossible. But a few weeks ago, I started seeing someone I met online, and it just felt right. Our conversations were great, we had a ton in common, and I felt truly happy for the first time in a really long time. But a couple days befrey birthday, she messaged me, ""we need to talk."" She said that she really liked me, but didn't think it would work out long term, and felt it was best if we went out separate ways. She couldn't explain why she felt this way. 

It hit me like a brick wall. It's been about a week since then, and although I'm doing better, I can't help but feel incredibly lonely. It took me so long to find someone I could go on more than one date with, and then it just goes away, as if there was never a connection. I'm not sure what the want anymore. 

Some days I just want to fall asleep and wake up holding someone I care about. I miss that feeling of starting your day knowing you're gonna be all right. And other days I just want sex, thinking maybe it'll be enough to keep me going a little longer. But either way, I still feel alone.

76,"My 19th birthday is right around the corner. I moved with my family to another country when I was 12, and I've been here for almost 7 years. I left behind all my lifelong friends, my family, most of my belongings and a lot of other physical and emotional stuff. I genuinely miss my home A LOT. It's killing me everyday.

&amp;#x200B;

For the first 4 years I've felt miserable, worthless, discarded and like I didn't belong in here. It's left me with a deeply rooted mentality of worthlessness, fears of abandonment and anxieties. The last 3 years have been better, as I've rebuilt my social life and got a lot of my shit together, but I'm still just as miserable in this country as I was in the first 4 years. I'm 100% convinced I will be for the rest of my life if I stay here.

&amp;#x200B;

This is my last year of High School. My parents want me to go to college for another 4 years after I'm done. My initial plan was to finish college here, and then return to my home country. But the thing is: I am not an academic person at all. Each school year is significantly harder than the other. Nor do I even wish to work in any field that requires college. Besides, I can never possibly bring myself to stay for 4 more years in this country.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to go back home by the end of 2019. I will discuss this with my parents, friends and extended family, but I also wish to hear some unbiased advice from you.

&amp;#x200B;

My plan:

&amp;#x200B;

I want to finish my last year of High School here. Then I will move home, to the big city I've lived the first 12 years of my life in, in the apartment I grew up in, and live there alone, as my parents will stay here. That means I won't have to pay for rent, ever. Then, I'd like to take some courses which will allow me to be able to work in a field which has to do with children/school/kindergarten/etc. Since I only have my High School diploma, I will work in an ""after school"" (a place where younger kids go to after school ends, where they play, eat and do their homework for a few hours a day). I would LOVE to do that, and I think it will be a job to make me happy. I've been part of ""after schools"" for most of my life when I was younger, starting from the 1st grade, and I've loved every second of it. I can work very well with children, and the idea of helping them become good young adults would give me reason and motivation. Also, the salary would be more than enough to keep me from starving.

&amp;#x200B;

That's my plan. Other pros of me going back home would be that I would finally be able to be around all the people I've left behind: My lifelong friends whom I still stay in contact with and visit once a year to this day (so you know that they haven't forgotten about me). My family, including all my young nephews and nieces. I will finally be able to be a real uncle to all of them and make a genuine connection, rather than be ""that guy that visits once a year"". I've always wanted that.

&amp;#x200B;

The only cons of leaving right now, instead of finishing college, is that my quality of life will become significantly worse. Not BAD, but definitely not THE BEST. But as I said, I don't really want to go to college anyways. I wouldn't go even if I could do it in my home country. I'm not an academic person at all.

77,"So your boyfriend plays (insert currently popular game) on his (insert game console or PC) and it upsets you that he isn't spending every waking moment with him? Well if you want to make him mad and make yourself cry tell him ""it's me or the (insert game console)"" he'll probably leave you right then or soon. And to think you aren't as good as a game console will make you cry and you'll lose your boyfriend. So my advice is to become a more attractive option, if he comes home works fulltime and you don't and he comes home to chillout to skyrim or whatever don't be mad that it translates to lots of game time.

a relationship is give and take, if you give him a reason to spend a lot of time with you then he'll give you his time.

79,"I am a 22 year old male. Fresh out of college. Working for a pretty decent company, and actually tasked with giving a presentation for new hires to everyone I work with.

Something like 200 people. I have to wear a full suit and tie even.

I told my friend Ashley, who says I constantly annoy her as a ""know-it-all"" that I was a bit nervous about it. We always tease each other. She said ""whatever you do, don't overthink it. You wouldn't want to have that dream where you're doing the presentation NAKED! Hahaha"". I scoffed at how ridiculous that was. But I admit I did blush a bit.

The next night, I dreamed I was giving the presentation. Everyone sounded impressed. Everything I was saying was on the money. Then, when I got to my key point, I heard snickering in the crowd.

The snickering turned into slight laughter. Then that grew into loud, uproarious laughter.

I felt air conditioning on my bare butt-cheeks.

I looked down and I was naked. But even worse, not even ""naked"". I was wearing nothing but a red tie and tube socks. You know the ones? The high white socks with red white and blue rings around the top? The same type I was laughed at in the 7th grade locker room for wearing while changing.

My tie hanging over my bare, lily-white belly (not fat, but a rounded belly from snacking too much and never hitting the gym).

Everyone starts snapping cell phone pics as I desperately cover my penis and turn my plump white ""bubble butt"" towards the crowd and try to get out of the room, which is of course locked.

My boss, Ms. Silvan, gets up and says ""Next time I should hire a speaker who's dressed to impress!"" and SPANKS my naked ass as I woke up panting in cold sweats.

I know it's ridiculous, but the dream felt SO freaking real. I cringe when I think of that feeling of the air conditioning on my bare tush. I blush when I imagine looking down at my bare body. And the looks on the laughing faces of everyone in the crowd (especially Courtney in Finance ugh).

Thanks to Ashley I now have this dream every freaking night for the last 2 weeks. And it never stops feeling real!

Ashley said ""oh this is too good. I can't stop mentally stripping you down to your cute little tube socks. Sweet dreams!""

I understand the meaning of the dream itself, but:

1. Why do you think Ashley finds it so amusing and hilarious? 

2. What is humorous about ""someone like me"" as she puts it, being in such a nightmare scenario?! 

3. And why TUBE SOCKS and a TIE??",02Feb2019,1
80,"My parents have suffered extreme hardship throughout their lives through no fault of their own. They struggled terribly financially, but through budgeting and counting the pennies they managed to always make it work for us as a family. Later in life through sacrifices and dedication at work, they have managed to become somewhat quite wealthy. They have been extremely generous with their money when it comes to their children, and have kindly bought us all a house of our choice paid for in cash.

This sounds amazing I know, and it now allows me to save all of my income and enjoy things in life which is what they want, but I just can't bring myself to do it. I've seen how hard my parents had to work to earn this money, and I find myself feeling guilty if I treat myself in any way. I am living the life they once did by counting the pennies with my groceries, I haven't bought any new clothes in over a year and I'm not buying things I like, and whilst my savings are building up, it's making me quite unhappy.

I think one of my issues is that I hope to be able to repay the favour to my own children with buying their houses in cash (amongst other things), but how will I do this if I don't save all my money? Another issue is that I worry if I start buying things or going on holidays, they make think I'm frittering all my money away. I also think I've just adopted their spending style, but at the same time I do think if I had never had a penny from my parents, I wouldn't feel such guilt.

81,"Just something that's been on my mind for a while.

I suppose maybe that's the ""basic"" definition of what spoiled would be like, but hear me out.

&amp;#x200B;

Just a lil background: I'm turning 21 this year, and somehow I feel like I'm still being babied by my parents. I'm graduating from college soon and don't have a job yet, so yeah I'm still living with them and stuff. But it kinda irks me that I still need their permission for the simplest things?? I still need to ask permission whenever I wanna go somewhere, and sometimes they still tell me I have to be home by *this* time, etc. And also; I'm an Asian girl so. idk maybe that's relevant somehow lol

Here's where my question comes in. Two things happened this morning that made me think a lot:

1. I hang out with my bf every Saturday. At this point it has become kinda routine so we basically just ""ask"" my parents (for the sake of asking I guess idk) and then we're set. Most, if not all the time, however, my mom always tells me not to stay out too late. I get it, she's worried and stuff. But recently we've just been hanging out at a house the whole day with other friends, so we're not alone. And bf has a car so he drives me home. There's practically nothing *unsafe* about what we're doing so I don't get why they'd be so worried if I stayed out or not. So...y'know...I asked her *why.* That's it, I just asked her why I shouldn't be allowed to stay out late. Boy, she got so mad. Adults seem to hate being questioned which is really too bad because I question pretty much everything. Told me I should be appreciating the very fact that I'm even allowed to leave in the first place, which I do, it's just...idk. Time always seems too fast when you're having fun I guess.
2. Bf and I are out now at a mall. Surprise-treated me to pancakes after I told him I was sad that I woke up late and missed Mcdonald's breakfast menu. Afterwards, I saw this jacket I really liked--it's the same one bf was supposed to buy for me months before, but I hesitated and ended up leaving it. Now I'm sure I wanted it and I told him so, but he wouldn't buy it and just said ""next time."" So I told him I can just pay him back if he didn't want to spend on it himself (didn't have enough money at that time). But he still refused. Said something about earning (for) it or something. And then I just got sad and quiet for a while after that. This is then the time I started questioning myself and felt bad for being upset that I didn't get what I want despite him just treating me to something else I liked.

TL;DR: I'm rebellious towards my mom and what I consider ""unreasonable"" rules despite already getting 50% my way, and get upset that I don't get something I think I really wanted. No tantrums or anything, just lowkey upset....and then feeling upset for feeling upset. :x Does this...make me spoiled somehow?",02Feb2019,1

92,"I'm 22 she is 20. I went to a 2 week program in Spain last summer almost 6 months ago now. I had a roommate and we got along really well. She always told people how happy she was that we were roommates and we spent a lot of time together.

She lives ~2 hours away from me (in America) and we said we were gonna see each other again. But I've been trying to make plans for a while and it never works out because our schedules are different. I've let her know that I understand if she's not interested in hanging out but she said she really wants to see me.

Finally we decided that this weekend works for both of us, she assured me that she could meet me anywhere in the city and would definitely be there. Except that was a week ago and she never replied to my text saying I'll be there on Saturday (today). I sent her another one 2 days ago and she didn't reply to that either so I'm just not going. She has ADHD and is forgetful but this is ridiculous tbh. Even though I really wanted to see her again I feel like she really doesn't care about me so I think I have to let it go.",02Feb2019,1
94,"I think I have a slightly different lifestory. I know it's pretty crazy to ask like this but believe me I have no one to tell it and I feel an intense urge to share it I don't know why. I know I'm trying to grab some attention but I'm desperate. You're ok to judge me.



I was born on 7th February, 2002 (My B'day is next Thursday) in Kolkata, West Bengal, India. When I was 9 months old I got a deseas called SJS (Steven Johnson's Syndrome). It's very rare and dangerous. 1 out of 3 people die and the rest suffer for there life. The doctor couldn't even detect what the problem was and gave me the treatment of Harpes, a similar but very common and less dangerous deseas. I almost died. Not trying to make it dramatic but its kind of a wonder that I'm still alive typing this. Anyway it couldn't just leave me unharmed. It affected my eyes.



I got severe dry eyes (it's physically impossible for me to cry, even while vutt8ng onions), photo phobia (extra sensitivity to light, I can't go outside with without a cap or sun glass, I can't make eye contact) and low vision (6% in my left and 65% in my right eye). I had to to be myself an eye drop every hour. No school wanted to take me in.



My parents then admitted me to a blind hostel when I was 6. It was totally different there. Most students were from poor villeges. I was 3rd student (in that time) from Kolkata. It was totally different. I grew up like a villege boy. Spent my time with cows, goats, ships. I learned Brail. I made some friends there. It wasn't too bad. Until my parents started fighting.



My mom and dad got divorced when I was 10. My dad was alcoholic and abusive. Both parties wanted to have my custody and it was messed up. At last my mom got me. My dad still stalked me hard before he gave up entirely.



My mom took me home when I was 12. My eye condition improved a little and we both knew I would have no future there. I was admitted to a normal school (I could take my eye drops on my own now). But it created other problems.



I couldn't see the black board, my school mates were not helpful. I got bullied for my eyes. I made no friends here. I had depression and I stayed home all the time. I attempted suicide at 13 by trying to drink acid but unfortunately it didn't work out.



After staying alone for all these years, I got some more problems to deal with. Social anxiety and depression was already there, the new addition was maladaptive daydreaming disorder which almost destroyed my social and even personal life.



And here I am. Writing my own story for a some strangers to read and trying to feel some acceptance and appreciation. Too pathetic isn't it?



Next Thursday is my birthday and it's so sad that to think that my mom, grandpa and grandma will be the only people to wish me.

My sister is one of my best friends and she'll be my maid of honor, but it's a weird thing to look up at 23 and realize I don't have girlfriends to do pre-wedding stuff with. I've lost touch with my girlfriends from college, and I like the girls in my grad program but we really aren't close. Kinda bummed about it, I guess.",02Feb2019,1
100,"So I need some advices. My ""friend"" told me that one night he and other guy broke into my house and ate sausages. Then slapped my sleeping face with it. He said at very  sarcastic voice that didn´t stole anything. I remember that I bought  sausages few weeks ago but never ate them. Also i have mysterious scratches at skin but don't remember where it came. I don't have any other proofs so can't be 100% sure. I have lost my primary key too. What should I do? How can I bust them if they come again?

102,"Just coming to realise how temporary things are. Like even if you think you’re happy, the things that make you happy can easily disappear. Most people have been at a low point in life, which I thought I was passed, but now everything that made me happy has gone again and I’m feeling as empty as ever. I just don’t know how you’re supposed to live through all the stuff life throws at you when you know how shitty and impermanent your happiness, which stops you from feeling low in the first place, really is- it’s like it’s just on repeat and you should simply end the cycle to prevent it happening all over again.",02Feb2019,1

106,"I am working for a small start up. Two years now. My first “real job” out of college we are a small but close knit group. I really respect my coworkers and my boss. And I do enjoy the work I do. But lately the business has been struggling and makes me worry about the life of the company. 
I found a job opening at a company I have always wanted to work for with a job opportunity right up my alley. They are a great company, probably pay more, and aren’t going anywhere anytime soon. 
All in all it would be a no brainer to apply for this job, except that now i have this sense of loyalty to stick with the small business I currently work at. If I leave this job then the company would definitely suffer because everyone plays and integral part. I would be abandoning the company and boss that gave me a chance and gave me experience and probably would be setting them up for failure.  And I might lose all respect for my current boss. But I’m afraid of my current job security and I’m not sure if I want to miss this opportunity to work for the larger company. 
I don’t know what to do :(",02Feb2019,1

Lately, I’ve been feeling pretty gloomy, especially today. I’m not like sad or depressed or anything, I’m just like....I don’t know. Maybe it’s cause of the weather and some doubts about me and this one girl and I don’t know. 


In 12 days, it’ll be my birthday and I really don’t know what to do for my birthday or whatever. I honestly don’t really want to celebrate it. Or I mean...I don’t care about or feel like celebrating it. I don’t even know what I’m saying at this point lol. 

Honestly, I just need a dog right now, something like a German Shepherd. Seeing a ton of these funny or cute dog gifs here on Reddit kinda makes me wish I have one since honestly, I need, want, and can use a little buddy with me right now. ",02Feb2019,1

-He always used to make fun of me, in a kind of perverted way and rude and to gossip about me.
-His attitude and his friends' attitude toward me is very rude, dishonorable, impolite.
-And i don't know why he usually  encourages his friends to talk to me, date me...
-but it seems like he really hates me from the way he behaves. 
I don't know why he does this things. And now he told a few people that he likes me.
