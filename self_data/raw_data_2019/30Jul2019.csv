I can control my actions but I never feel like I'm doing them its like I am looking at my life in a different perspective like watching a movie bit its my life I used to feel the sun on my face, the fresh air in my lungs, the feel of grass, leaf's  ect but its a blur ive been like this for almost a year now and I want to snap out of it but I don't know how ive tried everything, getting more sleep, meditating, breathing in more -note that I am a physically active person, I do karate and take part in various sports from time to time, I eat healthy, I have good hygiene WHAT IS IT THAT IM MISSING!!?? this whole feeling as though I'm trapped in my head not feeling my arms and legs makes me feel like utter crap. I'm not depressed but I'm not happy I'm just am. I never feel happy nor do I feel sad I'm just 'alright'. To me everything looks fake and artificial the sky has no depth, the trees are 2d, everything is just off and when I focus I can maybe feel something along the lines of awake but not fullt and usually it only lasts for like 2-3 seconds and I just fall back into my mind again. its incredibly frustrating. I feel emotions but not deeply like I will be happy sad exited angry whatever byt it never means anything to me. I want to feel alive and out of my body anyone have any suggestions im all ears.",30Jul2019,3

4,"For the last 6 years, I‚Äôve been the advisor to the student newspaper at my alma mater. I took the job when I moved into marketing. 

Before that, I alternated between teaching community college full time and freelance journalism, or full time journalism with an adjunct gig on the side (I have my masters). 

I wasn‚Äôt sure, when I took the more lucrative job in marketing, whether I would like it. 

This advisor position let me keep my feet in my two previous careers, academia and journalism, while gaining experience in a new field. 

If marketing didn‚Äôt work out, I could show on my resume that I stayed active in my previous careers and go back. 

I‚Äôm not going back. The last few years in marketing have been good for me. I‚Äôm forging professional relationships and interests. 

Aside from the student paper, I haven‚Äôt been involved in journalism since 2013. The industry has had massive changes since then. I‚Äôm not doing my students any good by giving them old advice. 

Besides, I haven‚Äôt had a two-day weekend since starting there (except summers). This means I‚Äôve missed out on everything from friends‚Äô weddings to family events to being involved in community theater because I can‚Äôt plan on having a full two days off. 

When I called my boss and told her, she said I was doing the right thing. She ended the phone call with, ‚Äúlove ya!‚Äù 

The woman worked with me when I was a student, and all 6 years I was here. 

She‚Äôs been a part of my life for a decade, and the hardest part was building up the phone call to tell her I was done. I didn‚Äôt want to let her down. 

So...14 years after I embarked on an academic career, I cut the final ties. It‚Äôs really the end of an era.",30Jul2019,2

10,"I've just been feeling down lately. It's not super bad, but it's noticable.

For some reason I've been thinking about my ex again. It's been nearly a year and a half since we broke up and two other failed relationships in between. I think I just need someone. Someone to talk to, someone who'll love and understand me. I know I'm supposed to be able to enjoy my own company, and I do, but it'd be so much easier with someone else.

Honestly, I just want to love again. I just want to dedicate myself to someone. I want to go out and do fun things with them, I want to write them songs, I want to cuddle and watch movies, I want to listen to music or even trip together. So many wishes without them coming true in sight. I want to feel love and warmth. I don't want to feel lonely anymore. I've got friends, sure, but... I don't know...

I want a best friend. Not a friend I like the most, but an actual best friend. Like, someone to whom I will be best friend to as well, someone to do everything together with. I want to jam with them, I want to go on trips with them, I want to talk about the future with them. I want intimacy.

All these wishes make me want to isolate myself in a bubble and rid myself of emotions. The bad ones outweigh the good ones. I want to feel numb. I want to lose all senses. But I don't want to die. I like living, I think. I just... I don't know what I want anymore. I really don't.",30Jul2019,4

14,"My ex and I broke up about a year ago and we were together for about 18 months before that. Our communication and love for each other was healthy until the naive and idiotic guy I was grew bored with the relationship and wanted to live a bachelor lifestyle. I know she would have never broken up with me‚Äî I was perfect in her eyes, although in my own retrospect I've come to acknowledge the many times I was wrong to her.

During our time apart I didn't live out the lifestyle I set out to due to relationship issues my parents were having whom eventually divorced. I grew close to both my parents during this time, especially my dad, who taught me the importance of valuing a significant other and the necessary mindset to have in a growing relationship. I became distant from friends during this time, moved to the city, and started paying rent to sleep on a strangers couch. This became an important learning period for me and I started practicing self growth. 

I can't speak entirely for my ex since we weren't taking during this time. She took the break up hard and isolated herself according to her friends. She was always a more reserved type but after some time became a heavy flirt and had flings with a number of guys. Her confidence was through the roof but she was taken advantage of at times. This period eventually came to an end and she isolated herself again. Soon she gathered herself and redirected her confidence to modeling (I remember being happy to see this since she is very beautiful but always struggled with insecurities and shyness). She found a new person of interest who she is now currently dating and they do seem very happy and healthy together.

During what seemed like both our lowest points in the breakup I asked her to lunch so I could apologize for the person I was (this was around the time of my parents divorce and she was having her flings). I wasn't looking for closure and sincerely wanted to apologize for my behavior. She didn't say much that day but I could read all the emotions in her face and eyes. I could tell it was hard for her to listen to me, yet alone look at me. It seemed she was still recovering and had negative feelings towards me which I understood. 

Fast forward two months ago when we were both on a Yosemite trip together. We have crossover friends and we were in two different groups of a caravan that met there to camp. Nothing but small talk between her and I but tensions were gone and we could now have normal conversations in a group.

Come last weekend at a friends get together. She's there without her boyfriend and hanging with her girlfriends while I'm with another group. We didn't really acknowledge each other until our groups collided and we all began socializing. I noticed that we slowly stopped talking in the group and began to speak to each other directly. It felt completely natural as if 12 months hadn't passed. We were never alone and stayed with at least one other person which I think was good. There came a point in the night that our eye contact grew intimate and I could feel a loving energy. Our conversations and distance remained appropriate given her relationship status but there was an undeniable feeling of love that I'm certain was mutual. It ended up just being me, her, and the host at the end of the night when we finally went our separate ways‚Äî I don't think either of us wanted to leave. We did a lot of conversing and catching up that was built on how well we still know each other. We both insisted that we keep in touch and acknowledged how nice it was to reconnect.

I feel like I don't deserve the closure I received the other night and I feel selfish to say that I think we belong together and hope we find each other again (though I maintain to have full respect for her current relationship). Its possible that I'm just delusional in my feelings and reality is we've matured and respect each other now, but I'm sure its more than that. I know we did a lot of growing when we were apart and the love never died. I can say with certainty that I can't imagine being with anyone else. No one brings me as much comfort as she does.

20,"To preface, this is a throwaway account and I made it in hopes of getting advice from strangers as I don‚Äôt want to burden my friends with my problems.

I‚Äôm a guy and around two years ago I started questioning my sexuality. I thought I was bi at first, and came out to some close friends. About 6 months later I came to what I thought was a realization of being gay. I think that it was just not having found recent interest in girls, I‚Äôm not really sure tbh. 

I came out to friends AGAIN which was fucking painful to say the least. One of these ‚Äúfriends‚Äù ended up telling people that I was gay, so I cut them out of my life quickly. 

I can‚Äôt really describe what it was, but I think that I just lost all interest in girls for a while. Recently, though, I met this girl who I think I might have a crush on. It‚Äôs a rough situation because I haven‚Äôt really thought of girls in a romantic way in a while, and I think I have feelings for her but I‚Äôm not positive.

Anyways, I‚Äôm mentally struggling because not only do I not know if I like this girl or not, it would also kill me to come out to my friends as bi again if I do actually have feelings for her.

What should I do?

So I have this cousin that I didn't about until 3 days ago. The reason why I never knew him was because his parents decide to kick him out of the house and family after he graduated high school. He was kicked out because he didn't want to go college and he didn't want to work. This all happened when I was around 8. A couple of years past and now I'm 17. For the last 9 years my cousin was just wondering the streets of LA. Until one night he ran into my sister. My sister and him are about the same age 29 and so my sister knew who he was and he knew who she was. They met at a gas station while my sister was putting gas for mom's car. My sister said that he asked if my mom was home and if he can come take a shower. My sister said she wasn't home and ignored his 2nd question. And then my sister said bye and left. A week goes by and he somehow found where we lived! He knocked on our door and my mom opened the door and said that she saw him standing far from the door and asked if he can take a shower. My mom said that we have guests over and to go somewhere else. 2 days go by and he finds where the fuck my mom works and left a note on her car's window. The note said something under the lines of ""when can I come over?"". After that my mom got worried. I thought is was funny at first because like??? How would you even respond to that if you even wanted to. Anyways, after looking at more and think I was like: ""who is this?"" mom said it was some homeless man. I was freaking out because at the time all I knew was that my mom just got a note from a homeless man. A week passes and my mom comes home from work and when she opens the door, a tiny piece of paper falls. She thought at first it might be some kind of advertisement but then she realize that it was a note. She only speaks Spanish and didn't know how to read it so she told me to read it. The note said: ""Tia (aunt), I might be sitting or sleeping in the backyard"". We looked through a small window in our kitchen and sure enough, he is sleeping on the floor of our fucking backyard! I told my mom that she either calls the police or I'm going to beat the shit out of this man with a bat. So she called...everyone in our family! I told we should call the police but she was scared that he might get arrested, let free, then will come for her to do something. I told her that I understand that fear but there's nothing much we can do because he might keep harassing us. So she told me to call the police and I did. 5 minutes later my sister comes home and starts waiting for the police. 30 minutes pass, nothing. I called again, it's the same person I talked to and said that all police in our city was busy, but that another one will be available soon. I said alright. An hour and 30 minutes pass and so my sister just said fuck, and then went side to talk to him. She started yelling at him and tell him that our family has cut him off and that we want nothing to do with him. She told him that he had 5 minutes to leave before police got here. He said alright and left. Another hour comes by and police finally showed up. I was happy that ""hey I got to call 911 for the first time"" and I was also very disappointed that it took them 2 hours and 30 minutes to show up! Anyways, that day my mom told me about him and now 3 days later I'm writing this and I'm scared. We don't know what to do. We might end up getting a dog and we are for sure getting a cameras around our house.  


TL:DR  
My homeless cousin that I didn't know about started leaving notes and probably following my family around then one day slept in our backyard and now I'm worried that he might come back.

drama watcher attention please! ;-)

Yesterday I published a blog post about why I left my corporate career and became a travel blogger instead.

Now I got a comment from ""Anonymous"" yesterday night, saying that he/she worked in my company and that almost no one there would have liked me and blablabla (which is a blantant lie). The person must even be friends with me on Facebook or Instagram because only this way they could have found it that easily. (Which is pretty weak in my opinion)

First I simply wanted to delete the comment. But then I decided to answer instead. I expect him/her to come back soon and check for answers. Actually, it's pretty stupid because I did not even name my former company or attack anyone except one person (who ""Anonymous"" almost certainly is NOT). 

I don't really want this discussion on my blog post because it goes away from the message that I wanted to deliver (which is more like ""Go live your dreams - even if it's not that easy - be yourself"" motivational intent). 

But then I don't want to duck down and let a person get away with it that. I mean, how weak is that - being ""friends"" with someone on social media and then posting an anonymous comment with a lie?

I like debating, I want to change people's minds. You know, Normal shit people do when they see something they disagree with. But sometimes, the other person is just so bone-headed, so delusional and stupid that they just will not listen to what you are saying. And that is fucking infuriating. People aren't like that in real life, only on this fucking website? And why? why do I even bother with them?

I'm always of the opinion that you should treat someone the way you want to be treated, realize that the person you are typing to is a real person. Not everyone feels the same way. Some people I meet are just so filled with hate, or bias, or intolerance, or some other bullshit thing that makes reading their comments just fucking infuriating. And when I meet these people I think how miserable they must be, and why someone would waste their time being so negative, being so disagreeable. Like, there's nothing fun about that right? Why spend all your time on the internet full of hate and confrontation and bull-headedness? Waste of my time talking to those people, and they should know it's a waste of their time acting like that all the time.

I used to think that folks on Reddit were something else, that this website is filled with college students studying political science, or computer engineers working for Google or some shit like that. Now I realize most people on this site are just as dumb, maybe even dumber, than a lot of folks I know in real life. I'm starting to fail to see a reason to use this website anymore. Even when I try to avoid people I disagree with on issues I care about, they pop up and I just can't help but feel like I need to say something and defend my beliefs. 

How do you deal with these people? Do you comment to them and try to be polite? Angry? Or do you ignore them, and if so, how? I can't seem to ignore these kinds of comments...",30Jul2019,1
52,"The other day I created a Youtube channel, but still cannot come up with a name for the channel. At first, I was going to name it ""Life with Mat"" and I got so excited that I finally figured out a name. Then I was searching and they had a girl with 1 million subscribers with the name ""Life with Mak"". Now the reason I didn't choose the name ""Life with Mat"" is because if my channel ever actually got big, I wouldn't want people to judge me for not being original and coming up with something different. So I am asking you guys if any of you could help me come up with a channel name that will attract people to my channel and not think that I am stealing other people's ideas. What I want the channel to be based around is me vlogging, but I don't want it to be ""Mat Vlogs"" or just my name, Mateo Romero, and sometimes I do plan on doing other things like playing video games or doing challenges with some friends.

53,"I for some reason can't seem to motivate myself to find a career or reach my goals with anything other than pain. 

Anything I've achieved through my talents in soccer, working out, to giving speeches, to learning how to talk to girls, was ultimately fueled by pain, humiliation, or simply not wanting to feel a particular feeling again. I get that this kind of fuel can push you but. Ever since I've taken action to heal myself, things can seem kind of empty without those feelings pushing me.

54,"I hate how I have feelings for one of my coworkers.
I understand why I have feelings for her though.

Throughout my life, I've rarely received human affection.
Because of that, I find it hard to make bonds or feel connections with others.
Yet, she speaks so sweetly and asks me to help her out with work often, expressing thank yous and smiling.
I know the only reason why she speaks to me is to help her out with work and for me to act as a mentor.
Besides that small thing, I have no idea why I am head over heels for her.

I've been looking up ways to get rid of how you feel for 
One of those steps is to ask her out or to tell her how you felt about her.
However, I am 95% sure she is dating some one as I see that she gets into the same car and gets driven to her car that is a bit of a walk away.
It's obvious since she has been recently taking the same exit as my other co-workers and I.
If she was less reserved and maybe if we were a bit closer, I would ask to confirm.

If I did tell her my feelings, it would just make the office environment awkward to work in.
I also fear that she would stop asking me for help/mentorship.
I know how to seperate work and personal life from each other and would try to still help her even after being rejected.
Especially since I know she has the potential to surpass me in knowledge and ability.

I am happy that she going to be moving to a new shift in a few weeks, a more ideal shift than the one we are currently one.
Especially since it was stated in those videos and guides that having very little to no contact with them will help you forget about your feelings for them.

I hate that she has been coming to me in a bit more often to ask for help, as I am trying to overcome my feelings for her.
Albeit, I am happy that I've stopped stuttering around her.
I've always been good at hiding how I feel and to remain calm in most situations.

I am happy for her though.
I am always happy for others that manage to find someone to be with them, if it's not a toxic or abusive relationship.
It means that she can have someone help her grow and be happy with.

I remember I've read that book - I remember the title, author's name, the year it came out and all other technical information and trivia, but I completely forget the plot and all the good parts.

For example, The Road by Cormac McCarthy. I remember it as an exceptionally good book, I remember the premise and that it was very sad and depressing. But I don't remember all the good parts - all that made it so good, all that made it win prestigious literature prizes. Same goes for, let's say, The Alien movies. Great films!

For decades I had a job where I could *sneak* in my own laundry and wash/dry them in their machines. It was great. 

Then I got laid off because of budget cuts and got a new job. That didnt have laundry facilities. 

So... I started hand washing my clothes. Which sucked even though I dont have a lot of clothes (maybe 5 shirts, 2 pairs of jeans, a bunch of socks and underwear and undershirts). Wringing out the clothes was the most annoying part. 

Anyway I finally decided to buy a very small electric washing machine. It has two tubs ... one for washing and one for spinning/water extraction (not really drying like a normal dryer). 

And I'm all jazzed about buying it. Because I am cheap and never buy anything for myself unless I need it.  Cost me about $80 (originally $105), but I applied for a new credit card to get a $25 discount). I've also been watching youtube videos about it.

Regardless if you are a project manager who contracts or looking for the next permanent role, there are always fundamental skill requirements to focus on or highlight when landing the next role along your project management journey. It is essential to invest quality time into getting the CV or resume right.

Being able to sell yourself and your skills will separate you from the many other candidates also applying for that next role. Even the most experienced project managers can find themselves being overlooked for roles they are ideal for, by failing to adequately highlight the skills they have. The quality of the CV can make or hinder job-seeking prospects, so no assumptions should be made that experience and qualifications alone are enough. There are some ways available to draw attention to skills and make sure landing the next project management role is easier.

Some of the considerations here may seem like common sense, but you will be surprised how often they are overlooked, and if you are able to hone in on these items it should enable you to stand out from the pack. 

The audience should be considered when the CV or resume is composed, remember it can be modified for each role being applied. When asked to consider the audience for a project management CV, most people will assume the answer is simple: the hiring manager, who is looking for a new project manager. However, in reality, things are not always this simple and there are actually often multiple audiences to consider before the hiring manager is reached.

The CV should be written with three key audiences in mind. The first is a machine, the second is the person in charge of shortlisting, and the third is the hiring manager who will eventually make the decision.

The problem with focusing solely on the hiring manager is that your CV may never reach them. For this reason, you need to give consideration to what a machine will be looking for in order to pre-qualify CVs, and what a shortlisting professional might look for, given they may not actually have any project management knowledge.

Machines are likely to want to see common project management training phrases, keywords and qualifications, so make sure these are listed clearly. For instance, highlighting any completed [online PM courses](https://projectmanagementcompanion.com/certification/), and certifications such as PMP or PRINCE2, this should also be clearly mentioned.

The person in charge of shortlisting is more likely to be looking into personal details and general competency. Make sure any gaps in employment history are explained and avoid spelling and grammatical errors. Then focus on impressing the hiring manager with specific skills and past project successes.

The CV should always be tailored for the role, so it shows the specific skills and attributes that the role being applied for requires. Ensure to thoroughly read through the job advertisement, the person specification and any other relevant material and make a list of the skills they request.

Once known what they are looking for, create a CV that showcases the relevant skills and helps you to stand out as the ideal candidate. For instance, if the recruiter is looking for Agile project management skills, then list any Agile project management training completed, and giving examples of past Agile projects.

Again the following may seem logical, but is a feature frequently missed, this could be because there is an assumption from your experience that it is a given that your skill complies with the role. So if the role is for a project manager, you should describe yourself as a project manager. If they speak about a project charter instead of a project statement, you should too. Remember to always be truthful when describing skillset and where worked as any lies are likely to be found out.

When describing skills and roles, remember to be as specific as possible. Regardless of whether emphasising soft skills or job-specific skills, avoid being too general. There are only so many times a recruiter can read phrases like ""excellent communication skills"" and ""great attention to detail"" without rolling their eyes, so stand out by being as factual as possible without being repetitive.

Also focus on any soft skills possessed, highlight communication skills, and make sure the CV reads well. If you are committed to continuing your own personal development, make sure your CV shows evidence of this through any online PM courses completed. In terms of more specific project management skills possessed, try to think of the ones that are going to be most relevant - planning skills, risk management skills, resource management skills, etc. - and demonstrate that you have them. This can be achieved by talking about specific previous projects you have managed, and any awards received.

Job history should include some basic contextual information about what the role was, what it entailed, and what successes enjoyed. Of course, the balancing act with this is to avoid going into too much detail. Try to be clear and concise, as ideally a CV should fit onto two pages.

Regardless of how qualified for project management roles you may be you can still miss out. Don‚Äôt fail to take the appropriate steps to manage your CV, by highlighting the skills possessed by writing with all relevant audiences in mind, by tailoring your CV to the role you are applying for, and by being as specific and factual as you can. Remember, you are not the only one applying for roles, so take advantage of skills and highlight certifications to land the next role, as you are competing against your peers.",30Jul2019,0

71,"‚ö†Ô∏è warning: I do tell details of some childhood trauma (domestic abuse) so TRIGGER WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è 

I recently started having flashbacks of my father‚Äôs abuse and psychopathic issues. I always repressed it in my brain and remembered it like it was a story/folktale. Of course, I‚Äôm very traumatized and I will get anxiety and feel dreadful of my life because of it. I have horrible dreams of him. I haven‚Äôt talked to him for about 3 years, he showed up to one of my aunt‚Äôs (mom‚Äôs side) choir recital- uninvited and told me to give him hug- of course I yelled no and ran out and had a panic attack. This happened almost a year ago, I‚Äôve always been paranoid to see him in public or that he will follow/track/stalk me. I am not a perfect person, but I would say I‚Äôm living a lot better than some people who have been in traumas similar. After not talking to him for a few years, it disconnected me from some family members in fear that he would show up to family gatherings and such. Tomorrow, my bf and I are supposed to see my Aunt (dad‚Äôs side) and some other family members at a water park. Thinking of going alone made me anxious and gave me horrible flashbacks of different parts of my life where I have seen my father abuse other people in front of my eyes. I lived with my father‚Äôs 2737748th European girlfriend and she had a daughter and son around my age (F12) at the time (F11 and M15). One late night, my father got angry over a stupid xbox controller that he thought was broken, slammed it on the ground into pieces, looked for his girlfriends kids, the girl was taking a bath, he broke the locked door knob to both bathroom doors to terrify the girl while she was laying naked in the tub. He held the controller and wacked her with the wire and left. This made the brother come out to tell him to stop yelling at her and leave her alone, which ended up horribly. My dad yelled and punched walls and pushed the son into the game room. As all of this is happening, I‚Äôm following him around telling him he needs to stop and he needs to calm down and kept saying it‚Äôs not their fault. He starts to choke the 15 year old boy out, I could see his face turn purple and his eyes red in less than 3 seconds- his head looked like it was going to burst and His toes were basically the only thing touching the floor. I vividly remember that to this day (I‚Äôm 21 now). I remember him teaching his next european girlfriend how to drive because she never learned. He basically abused her while she was driving for her first time with me in the back seat. At that point I knew it was wrong and I actually punched him and hit him from the backseat and yelled STOP THAT‚ÄôS NOT OKAY SHE‚ÄôS DRIVING, DO NOT FUCKING HIT HER. And his reaction was silent, then later said I did a good job and that I deserve something nice and expensive (he was poor as shit- poor as in borrow-money-from-your-14-year-old-daughter poor). He thought I deserved fancy cowboy boots for defending his girlfriend from getting bashed in the head and almost causing us to crash. And lastly. A vision I remember so clearly. Probably the deepest one. When he was still with my mother. I have a half sister (different dads, same mom) from europe who I met when I was two. She protected me from a lot of the abuse. When I was maybe 5 my mom was working her ass off to get food on the table, and one night, my mom just couldn‚Äôt do dinner and my 10 year old sister was left to make dinner for me. She made plain angel hair spaghetti. I remember being told to stay in my room until someone told me it was okay to come out. When dinner was ready, my sister and I sat at the table with out spaghetti and apple juice. As I‚Äôm looking at her making jokes while there‚Äôs screaming and yelling 10 feet away from us. I just hear high pitch screaming from my mom, and I look over. He was dragging her by the hair on her head into their bedroom. I could just see my mom‚Äôs pain, immediately, my sister spit her apple juice into the spaghetti to make me laugh- which it did. The door was slammed shortly after. And I ended up pouring my whole glass of apple juice in mine just to be funny. But that image never left my mind. 

I just had flashbacks and ptsd about those vivid moments and it made me anxious to see part of the family I once was a part of. (The only toxic part of the family that I know of is my father‚Äôs dad (deceased) my father‚Äôs mom (71) and my father (50 and almost deceased). I cut out my grandma because she could not believe us when we said he abused us and she continues to be manipulated by her own son who keeps telling her we don‚Äôt talk to him because he doesn‚Äôt give us money. (Which doesn‚Äôt make sense because he never had money to begin with).

I have health problems (T1 diabetes, epilepsy and CKD being the main ones) and this last year, they meant i had to spend some time in hospital. I did all the doctors said, and got discharged, but then got called back 2x more for the CKD. The issue was the medication they put me on. Now, I'm on different meds, but the last test results seem to indicate that they aren't doing what they should. This in itself is bringing me down. On top of this, I'm working my ass off in a job I've been in for 18 years, and where i am the lowest paid person. I asked for a pay rise based on the work i do etc, and they turned round and said no, because you've had too much time off recently, and also... what else can you offer? I feel like i am only just making it through some months financially, so again, this felt like another blow.

My girlfriend is expecting a second child in January, and, I'm excited but also stressed about that too, wondering if there'll be enough money to cope. Also, we cannot conceive normally (because of my diabetes) so our children are born of sperm donors. I love our son to bits, but part of me is sad he isn't 'mine'. I can't talk to my gf about it, becuase she doesn't really understand why it bothers me so much.

I just feel like crying all the time and I have nobody to talk to about. I feel i've let people down and that it would be better if i could just disappear. Not necessarily die, but just, never have existed, so all the people I've affected could be happy.

75,"For most of my life I thought depression was feeling ‚Äúsad but for a longer time‚Äù. I know now that this is not true. Unfortunately, I‚Äôve had to experience this horrible mental illness in order to fully grasp how depressed people feel on the daily.

Depression is not sadness, it‚Äôs numbness, and the latter is orders of magnitude worse than the former.

It started of slow; I lost interest in some hobbies, I never wanted to hang out with friends, I slept much more than I used to...

Then it became worse; I lost contact with all of my friends and would literally sleep 18 hours a day. The rest of the day was spent watching YouTube on auto play because I couldn‚Äôt even be bothered to play a video game. During this time period I didn‚Äôt shower, take care of myself, and I even starved myself for days on a row.

Depression makes you lose everything that makes you yourself. The symptoms look similar to mere sadness, but believe me when I tell you that it is much worse.

This summer I‚Äôve started going to a therapist and it has actually helped me. I‚Äôm exercising, I‚Äôm taking regular showers and I‚Äôve retaken some of my hobbies. 

Programming was a big hobbie of mine and I felt really bad for abandoning it, now I‚Äôve been able to release some apps on Google play which I had completely forgotten about.

I'm in my early 30's and have my shit together. This means my own home, a wife, talking about having kids, bills and a tons of adult responsibilities.

I used to hang with this clique; we were about 5-10 guys who'd go out to bars, get drunk, and overall just be bros. Over the last 5 years we've been drifting apart quite substantially. These guys haven't moved on with their lives so there's nothing to relate to anymore. They all still live with their parents and spend all their time lounging, playing Nintendo, smoking weed and tagging each other in memes on facebook.

Whenever we do get together (3 times a year max), it's the same routine. Hang out in a parking lot and watch them get high and then go eat somewhere. It's boring. I did that in high school and am over it. I want to relate to my friends on an intellectual level, and not just plop on a couch stoned playing video games and stuffing our faces.

I try to invite them over at times and always get the same vague responses. (*""I'll see, I may have something""*)... and will later find out they got together at one of their parents' places to do the same shit they've been doing for years.

It hurts losing her. She gave so much and I couldn‚Äôt give back that love. I wish I could see her again.",30Jul2019,1

86,"I hate my current job. I work 10-11 hour shifts 5 days every week, the pay isnt great, and the benefits are nearly nonexistent. At my store, we've struggled with staff the entirety of my 1.5 year tenure here. 2 months of that time we have only had 2 employees, myself and another, to manage everything, and yet our home office doesnt do fuck all about it. We had a guy just work his last day on Sunday, the company has known about this departure for over 4 months, yet the recruiters have done absolutely nothing to find a replacement. I recently went back to my doctor who confirmed that my autoimmune disease was flaring up again, and that it was most likely due to how much I've been working  It's just not worth it anymore. Mentally and physically it's running me into the ground. We had a girl walk out and quit about a month ago, and my temptation to do the same is sky high. I have enough in my savings to get by for quite awhile, and I could definitely use a week or 2 to just dig deep and job search without being at work 10 hours a day. Its been a year and a half since I've had more than a 3 day weekend, and I miss being able to have at least a 1 week vacation per year. I'm so damn done here, but I cant get over the guilt I feel from the thought of up and quitting. My parents have burned the idea into my brain that it's bad to quit a job without having another one lined up, but is it really so bad when it's for the betterment of your mental and physical health?",30Jul2019,1
87,"I know how pathetic it sounds for a 26yr old to be excited about getting my hair done but it's been a year since I had it coloured. It's currently got 3/4 inches of dark blonde (my natural hair colour) then 2 inches of bleached hair (no colour) then 1 inch light blue then finally, 7/8 inches of ratty greeny blue (from the first dye). My hair is down to my waist. Tomorrow I'm going white with turquoise at the ends. 

This is the thing I've been looking forward to the most for weeks. It's been a rough couple of months, with family problems, ups and downs in my relationship and a hectic PhD schedule. I work  6 days a week every week, no overtime and next to no holiday days on cells that don't care if it's Christmas. I am taking a rare one tomorrow just to get it done. I am exhausted mentally and physically (chronic pain disorder) and just need something for myself. It's far more than my stipend allows, but I should be able to get a haircut every 6 months for godsake.

Dropping stats isn‚Äôt a realistic option for me because of how the rest of my schedule is set up. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong I absolutely hated that orchestra class with a passion. I was never good at it, and the people in the class always make fun of me. I don‚Äôt know why this is bothering me so much, I think it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs the only thing I‚Äôve stuck with throughout my entire life and I don‚Äôt want it to be ‚Äú just another thing I wasn‚Äôt good enough to stick with‚Äù.

91,"When I was ten or so I used to skateboard at my local skate park. The skate park had a community center right next door that I also hung out at. The community centers policy on skateboards is that you have to put it next to the front door. I did this and went to pay games or whatever. I got bored and decided to go skate. When I went to the door it was gone and no one was using it at the park. I then left that day and didnt go back for months because I had no reason to.

One day, I decided to go back to the community center. There was an ambulance at the front as we pull in. I enter the park to see this older like 18 19 yo kid on the half pipe layed out in pain. The ambulance put him on the stretcher for a broken leg. I looked over and there was a skateboard near the fence of the park. I go to get it for the dude and I flip it over. I cant believe my eyes as I flip it over to discover that the board was mine and karma broke this mans leg over it. A paramedic came over asked for the board. I told him it was mine and I had that board for 8 years after that. I just recently had to get rid of it because I ride longboards now and because all the hardware on the board needed to be replaced.",30Jul2019,1
92,"So a little bit of backstory and context: my family has always struggled financially and we're struggling right now as well, it's been our problem for longer than i've been alive and I plan to change that, I've done my research and asked for advice from people who have experience on this stuff, i've probably done more research than I will even need for this but i'm going to keep learning so I can adapt, i've written a plan ready and i've asked the honest opinions from a few adults that I know who have said that they loved the idea, my mom is going to try it with me, I hope it works and I might do some updates on the subject if I remember, when we actually try it next year",30Jul2019,6
93,"so the idea is that i'm a man dressed as a railroad baron with a cigar and a gold pocketwatch and i live in a fancy house with a servant (like what batman had) and i eat and i drop crumbs in my house for the rats to eat and then the three stooges come crawling out of the basement with mouse ears and noses on and are smelling the air and licking their lips and they find the crumbs and they start fighting over the crumbs and i laugh and then i get mad and i yell at them for eating my crumbs and then i eat the crumbs off the floor and accidentally eat a bug and so i cry for 20 minutes and then the three stoges come and kiss me and console me and then we sleep in the bed together and do what they do in teh three stooges movies where we all roll over at the same time a few times and flail our limbs to and fro and get mad at each other and that's the movie

and then the sequel is the same thing but instead of the three stooges its the avengers but its the same plot and everything but the characters are characters from the avengers team from the avengers movie instead of the three stooges and this one instead of being a comedy is instead a action movie and in this one i'm played by a sexier actor, like probably",30Jul2019,1

I rarely even drink alcohol (I haven‚Äôt had a drink in at least 2 months). I‚Äôm so stressed out because this was going to be the first big step in preparing for graduate school and now I‚Äôm stuck and I don‚Äôt even know why. After I got off the phone I thought about what I could have possibly taken and only could remember that I took Advil a few days earlier (it could have been anywhere from 2-7 days, I can‚Äôt remember exactly because the test was a week ago) because I was having headaches one day but it wasn‚Äôt anything more than what was recommended on the bottle.

I've also never had a best friend before so yeah. ;-; Now, the only friends I can rely on are my internet komrades on discord because I altogether quit socializing since two weeks ago.

103,"I saw a young girl around 18-20 trying to kick herself out of the drivers door of her car. I saw a person on the other side of the car trying to pull her back in. Something about the vibe made me assume it was a boyfriend (maybe simply because she was driving) but regardless, I needed to get that girl away from him. I blocked him in with my car, rolled the window down and screamed at him to get off of her. She looked me in the eyes crying and screamed for me to call 911. I cannot forget every detail of her face. She was so scared. As I was calling 911 she screamed to me that he had a gun. I started driving away very morally conflicted. He was walking towards my car on foot. I whipped around the corner and finally made the call. Luckily I had taken a photo of the car and plates so they send officers out immediately. About 3-5 min later I drove by where the car was and it was gone. 

I hope the girl made it out. I hope she was the one who took the car while he was chasing after me. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll update me. I don‚Äôt know how to get over this.",30Jul2019,3

I felt fucking terrible, but I did my best to push through and mustered up the courage to contact as many people in administration and asked for a third check of my exam results. After countless responses stating that, logically there was no way of changing and that I would have to repeat the year since the whole system is automatic, I received 30 minutes ago an email from one of my course supervisors stating that there had been an error on the exam and that I would thus be able to PASS the year. Although I first attribute this to luck, I now realize that I was unlucky in getting an incorrect grade and that had I not put the willpower in demanding that my exam copies be checked a 3rd time, I would be spending the next YEAR redoing already seen course material",30Jul2019,2
108,"I have been best friends with this girl my whole childhood but when we finished primary school and went into secondary school (i‚Äôm Irish), we went to different schools. 
        
We still stayed friends, in fact we went out almost every day together during 1st year, but as time went on, we started seeing each other less and less. In 2nd year, we only went out 4 times together. (Im going into 3rd year after the summer holidays).  
         She has always been the one to invite me out but she just stopped doing that a while ago. She knows i have problems with anxiety, especially when it comes to asking people to do things with me. However, i have asked her numerous times and sometimes she says yes but then leaves me on delivered when i tell her the time and place. Then apologises a few days later with some excuse (this has happened 2 times). 

The last time we went out, she brought one of her new friends without letting me know before, and i felt like i was 3rd wheeling when i was the one who planned the entire thing. A few months ago, she removed me from her vlogs, but final straw was when she didnt give me a birthday present. She has never done that before.
