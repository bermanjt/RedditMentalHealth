2,"Growing up in a Korean-American Christian family, you can probably already guess what my childhood was like and how I was brought up. I’m probably the most goody two shoes person you can meet. Picture the most responsible, conservative, pure looking 4.2 cumulative gpa asian girl soon to be attending a prestigious university for the nursing school. Yup that’s me

I’ve always been way too scared to do anything “bad” and lie to my parents. But I don’t know what the heck happened to me this year and seriously freshman me would have never imagined herself getting drunk at a party after two shots of vodka and a bottle of Mike’s hard lemonade. I got drunk af but it was so fun and it was worth the hangover the next day HAHAHA and the party was on a Saturday night so I had to go to church the next day and I felt so sick through the whole sermon. It was hilarious to me though because of the irony

I know this is probably kind of small and dumb to most people out there but to me this felt like a big turning point for me because it made me realize that my parents don’t have total control over me and I can be independent. They don’t have to know everything about me. I didn’t realize how trapped I felt and getting drunk at this party really woke me up.",14Jun2019,3

4,"I don’t know why I always do this but every time I’m in any group situation (like work or now, “school”) I need someone to have a crush on.

At my last job it was a coworker, then a regular customer. Now i got into a course and first I had a small crush on one of my friends, then that stopped because I love him so much as a friend, so my brain started shifting the attention to this other guy that’s kind of attractive and it’s nice to me...

I don’t know what’s going on but I’ve always done this, I feel like my brain needs to give romantic attention to someone at all times even tho I’m never going to do something about it.

It just makes me feel good I guess...",14Jun2019,1
5,"I just need to vent a little so I apologize in advance 





The past month has been difficult and I am not handling things well. I’m dealing with a shitty boss at work who does nothing but yell and talk down at me to my face and about me behind closed doors even though my performance is the best out of everyone on our team. I talked to hr today and was pretty much told to kick rocks and that they aren’t going to move me somewhere that I feel more comfortable and more useful.. my days are numbered (you can tell just by looking at the schedule put out for the following weeks) and I don’t know what to do other than hunt for somewhere else. 

I’m in a state I’m unfamiliar with with only one person(my SO) and I’m slipping back into a depressive episode.

6,"I’m not that athletic, so I would always sit out in gym. My friend, asks me to record him playing basketball and get some good clips, he asks me this and I do it because it is pretty fun. Today, he asks me and I said sure. All three gym teachers sit next to me and ask me what I’m doing, they say “why are you recording, that’s like pervert status.” The other coaches ask the same too and every time I try to explain, they shake their head and walk away with a confused face. Obviously I’m not a “pervert” and I was just pretty angry of how low they think of me. So I my gym teachers think I’m a pervert now. Just great.",14Jun2019,1
7,"It’s not the typical story of someone screenshotting them and sending them around. I’m actually pretty sure that nobody except their intended viewers saw them, but that’s not very comforting since i feel like i can’t talk to anyone about this. 

Some background info: i’m 18 f and have never been in a relationship before, sexual or otherwise. i was culturally indoctrinated to view sex and nudity as taboo, but i now completely disagree with these standards. i have a history of depression and childhood trauma. i’m really sorry for how long this is and how much i ramble, but i just want to lift some of this weight off my shoulders.

I’ve basically been using nudes as a way to get validation. I had apps similar to tinder and would occasionally find some dude who dmed me asking for pictures and send them. I don’t have the apps anymore since they did nothing positive for me, but i still feel weird about it. 

I sent pictures to 3 people. the first time (a few months ago) happened spontaneously with a guy that i accidentally messaged first, and things just escalated from there. i blocked him afterwards, but i didn’t really feel any shame or regret about it. i just liked feeling like i was wanted and kept my mind open to trying it again with another person.

The other 2 times happened very recently: a guy that i kept in contact with from saturday to yesterday, and one that i sent pictures to on sunday but have since been ignoring. the difference between these 2 interactions and the first one is that i was curious to see how long i could talk to each person. the second guy had very specific things that he wanted me to do and he was kind of demanding about it. he didn’t really care about my enjoyment and focused on himself. i wasn’t really bothered at first since i wasn’t doing it for sexual satisfaction, but it got really annoying really quickly as the week went by. 

after finishing yesterday, he randomly said that he didn’t feel like continuing with the dynamic and we unadded each other, presumably to pretend that it never happened. for some reason i feel a lot of disgust and shame within myself because of this, even though i was seriously considering to tell him the same thing and end it. i felt wrong afterwards despite the fact that i had no emotional attachment to him whatsoever. he never gave me a reason for why he wanted to stop but it leaves me feeling a lot of rejection and guilt. i never wanted to make anyone uncomfortable with what i was doing. i was dealing with a lot of stress and sadness already, but this little event broke me. i’ve been a mess today, crying on and off and being set off by every little thing. i feel like this situation was inevitable since my thoughts on female modesty are changing, and this was most likely the best possible outcome because it ended quickly without any real damage, but i still feel so shitty. 

to top it off, my interactions with the 3rd dude were a complete mistake that i regret more than anything. i wasn’t careful about what i was sending and never told him not to screenshot. i also only unadded him on snap instead of completely blocking him, so he keeps spamming me. i’m so tired of these stupid decisions i keep making and the consequences that follow them. i did this without really thinking about all of the possible, mostly negative outcomes that could have arised. maybe this was something that needed to happen, but i wish i could take everything back so that i could use this time to do something about my other problems. thank you so much for reading my messy thoughts",14Jun2019,1
8,"I know people love to push their agenda into things to feel included, and because Frozen had that gay storekeeper the LGBT groups have decided it was gun be there thing (Let it go somehow is about coming out) but I will be pretty annoyed if Disney gives into the pressure.

The movie was about a strong young woman, who was cut off from her power, and when she refound it was isolated for it. It is pretty clear in it's songs it is more about independence, shaking free of the idea that a woman needs a man to be strong or a love interest to be complete.

Elsa was a badass, she did it herself. Her sister helped her, but other then that the real lesson learned, the one I taught my neices with was that women are strong without support and that they don't need to find love to be a princess. 

If they add any sexuality to Elsa, hetero or otherwise, it'll strip that. Why can't children see that people don't need a partner to be strong, they don't need a relationship to be complete. I mean, we have a lot of stories of strong men who don't end up with someone, but why not strong girls? 

There is a statistically higher chance you'll end up figuring life out single then there is that you will end up figuring life out with a same sex partner, and there is so much pressure for young girls to find a partner to 'complete' them that even my 12 year old neice is emotionally distraught aboot not having someone. 

I just want her hero to be the same hero, i don't want them to strip away the power of the individual to appease some thirsty ass adult fans who want to ship a sexuality on a childs character. Let her be Elsa, the single, independent ice queen. Let them know that that are strong enough by themselves. 

If Disney wants to make a lesbian princess,  they can go for it,  just don't make the refreshingly rare independent woman it.",14Jun2019,0
9,"When I was 15 my teacher said I had to choose if I was going to college or university. She told me if you learn well by studying and taking notes, an academic learner, you go to university. If you learn by doing, you go to college or straight to work. I was 15. I didn’t know what I wanted. I just knew that I hate taking notes and studying. 

I believed for 15 years that I could never go to university. I truly believed I wasn’t smart enough. 

Three months ago I said to my husband that I might go to school to be a hairdresser. He said “why don’t you just go to university and study something you actually care about?”

I said “no I’m not ‘university’ smart”

He said that was the dumbest thing he ever heard.

11,"Tomorrow morning I'm going fishing with my dad for the first time in almost four years now. I don't want it to be obvious,  but I actually feel resentful about it. At least five times a year I get to hear about these big trips that he plans with my sisters husband. At any family function I basically just sit there while they talk and get to hear about all the things they've been doing and are planning.  

Recently I lost my job and on the last month of my lease with no rent money saved up. My parents have guardianship of my daughter and just did a total overhaul on my car because the extra mileage was deemed unsafe in it's (previously) current condition. Growing up I helped my dad repair all our vehicles and between that, fishing, and horse riding was basically all we bonded over; now I do all of that on my own while my sister and her husband get all of my family's time.

13,"I used to be pretty thin as a kid, then I gained around 22 lbs when I was ten, because I would sneak sugary snacks into my room at night, thinking it was normal. I thought I'd lose the weight eventually. I didn't. These habits continued over the next five years, and they became increasingly hard to kick. When senior high school began, I started going to school away from home, which meant that I was now in charge of my own meals. I had become extremely insecure about my weight, as any sixteen-year old girl would be. I would starve myself, thinking that I had found the solution to my problems, but once I felt painfully hungry, I would eat--no, I would overeat. I'd stuff my face with fried food and biscuits, never stopping until I felt absolutely disgusted by myself. Once that ended, I'd swear to never eat again. The cycle continues to repeat. I thought I was doing the right thing. I was mad at the people who told me to eat regular meals, because they were ruining my diet. These habits persisted until I graduated from high school last March. My weight had hit 143.8 lbs, which was definitely overweight for my height (I'm 5'1). The fact that I had nothing to distract myself with made it even worse -- all I did was eat, and eat, and eat. I'd have a bite of something, and promise myself the next was going to be the last, until I had completely eaten the whole pack. 

About a month and a half ago, I decided to try and ditch the habits of binge-eating. It wasn't easy. I was essentially addicted to food. It was like telling someone with a drug addiction to just quit. I would walk past the fridge and feel this strong urge to just RAID it. It felt terrible. Every time I ate something, it took so much effort and energy to stop myself from reaching out for something else. The first week felt like hell. I wanted to eat, even if I wasn't even hungry. I started to try and distract my taste buds by making tea and putting it in the freezer for a bit, to try and convince myself that I was having a shake. 

During the second week, I found it easier to cope with it. I still ate more than I was supposed to at times, but I was able to stop myself. Sometimes, when I thought about eating something when I wasn't hungry, I would simply hold it for a few moments, and then put it back in the fridge. I was bigger than my problems, and it took me a while to realize that. No, I wasn't starving myself or telling myself not to eat -- I was just keeping myself from eating way too much and feeling guilty as a result of my actions. 

Since I started, I had lost about 13 lbs, and it still feels unreal. The pants that once choked by hips now fit like a glove, and I no longer feel these insane urges to binge eat. I'm still striving to lose 10~15 more pounds, so I might start exercising soon. 

What I've learned from this experience is that you really can't improve yourself by hating yourself. I tried to starve myself because I hated myself, and that failed. The effort I'm currently putting into losing weight comes from a place of love, and I intend to continue working harder for myself.

That being said, thank you for your time. Hehe. :^)",14Jun2019,1
14,"I have an addictive personality. I don’t feel that I’m addicted to anything but I have no off switch or willpower when it comes to anything that’s addictive.

I don’t crave anything specific, but anytime I enjoy something I abuse it to a point that it’s detrimental to my life. Ranges from soft drinks, specific foods, alcohol, drugs or work. I don’t crave anything specific and function within reason with or without any of these, but once I start I can’t stop. It’s never just 1 beer.

15,"There's a lot of generational stereotypes that are total bullshit about us, like that we're entitled or lazy and all the other nonsense that older generations have said about every younger generation since the dawn of time, but this one is an honest-to-god flaw - We find it acceptable to pull out of events we've agreed to go to at the last minute so often and so reliably that it's basically expected when you host an event for at least 25% of the people to not show up.  


This sucks.   


It means planning events is impossible without nasty techniques like getting deposits from people. Saying ""I'll be there"" means ""I'll be there unless I don't feel like getting dressed when the time comes to leave.   


When you make a commitment to be somewhere, and the hosts expects you to be there, you owe it to that person to do everything you can to be there! (Unless there's a genuine excuse of course, beyond apathy)

25,"I'm staying at a couple's home for 1.5 weeks and learned they have a female indoor cat. Yesterday I knew the cat's name but didn't meet her. Today I saw her in her climbing house (a set up for the cat) and she looked at me. She later crossed the living room and I saw her from a distance. The cat hid behind the sofa and I kept my distance. Eventually I approached today, spoke softly and reached out my hand so she could smell it, to get acquainted, nothing more.

Later on after minding my own business, she cautiously approached my bag, sniffing it...but didn't come to my hand.

I left her alone. Then later on this evening was finally a breakthrough. I walked into the den where her climbing apparatus is and she rubbed my leg...I stuck out my hand again, reached out and was finally able to pet her :) In fact she kept circling around my crouched leg and rubbed my pants while I petted her :D

So I think we made progress. I then left the room. Later on the cat was sitting on the carpet in the same room as me but kept looking my way, keeping her eyes glued on me. I approached her, she wasn't as social...she let me scratch her behind her ears, but then walked off.

Do you think there's potential for more interaction? Should I left her come to me, or approach her and if so how should I act around her, talk to her? Softly and calmly, I suppose.

I've been in the worst physical situation I've ever been in. I have no electricity, no water, no way to bathe or even eat at this point, all because my parents can't pay the bills. I understand it's hard, and I don't want to blame. I don't want to find myself biting the hand that feeds me. For three weeks I've been without my phone, and these three weeks I've really been my happiest in months. My Dad gave me a pocket knife a couple weeks ago and it's been a huge joy. I sharpened a stick I liked into a spear and every day I've gone out and practiced it. I also picked up a hobby I'm not really proud of, I guess in a way it's self harm but it's just dawning on me it's self harm:five finger fillet. That cowboy game with the knife, and the song I think everyone would know, the knife game. Through those two hobbies I became really, really happy. I also found something to look forward to, and that's growing out my hair. I used to have it long, like really long. Shoulder length hair. At the time, I never really liked it. But I didn't think I looked good without long hair so I kept it. I look back and I feel really dumb for cutting it, it was like my only defining physical quality. I miss it and I just really look forward to having it back. Anyways, through the hobbies I bullshitted around with, I actually got better. I got better really fast. I went from barely being able to throw the spear without it turning to being able to nail it across the yard completely straight. I went from knicking my fingers to be able to go really fast and without harming myself. Of course, there was a time I cut myself really bad, but all part of the game, huh? 

I just got my phone back today, and it felt weird to hold it again. Almost like I was sad to hold it again. I still want to practice what the hobbies I had picked up, but I don't know if that's what I want to do. I honestly do want to quit Reddit. Or at least start another account. Start over. Wipe my depressive bullshit on this one. I used it for venting. I wanna say this'll be my last post but I don't know if that's how it'll turn out.

He got mixed up in some criminal stuff and his dog Marley got sent to some animal shelter so me and my mom decided to take care of her after that. she's been here for a few weeks and we have been taking care of her even though we have two cats. one cat who we've had for a very long time since birth and another cat whose only 3 months old and just adopted called ratchet. we had to keep Marley at a separate house on our property because we have one house where my grandma lives and another house where me and my mom live at and my granny is currently on vacation. Marley is a nice dog she just isn't very smart so one day she got out of our yard. ratchet was outside for a little while so my mom made me take Marley back up to my Granny's house. When I came back down she broke out again and I heard my mom screaming and so was her boyfriend. when I came down they were talking about how bad Marley was and crying. I asked her what happened she said that she found ratchet Dead with his guts pouring out onto the grass and him still alive suffering. so since she was so scared and she didn't know what to do her boyfriend who really loved cats had to do it. After that we all just sat inside and talked about ratchet and how good he was not much we loved him. I never even got to say bye and I never even hung out with him that much. we only had him for a few weeks at the time he was so cute he would always play with me every single time I came down he'd come running down the hallway and he'd bat my feet and just want to be picked up and hugged.

38,"A little bit of backstory. 

I am a Project Coordinator at an IT Firm and she is a Manager at a Finance Company. We were friends for about a year before dating and have been dating for almost two years. We both work hard and perform well in terms of education and career. We used to work together but now work in different companies. Before we dated she used to say she would never date anyone younger than her, but obliviously i managed to get her to fall for me. She is a very sweet, innocent, attractive and sometimes a bit gullible.

Its been a very serious relationship from the beginning as she has a troubled past and had eloped with a guy in her teens and when the relationship turned abusive she left him and lived with her parents for a while.

Because of this reason primarily I felt like the option of breaking up with her was out of the question, especially as she was at the age of getting married. I feel very guilty when she feels sad because i do love her a lot and it breaks my heart when she gets sad or tears.

The issues I have are

1. Im 23 and I feel trapped. I don't want to break up with her but I also don't want to get married anytime soon. I don't feel at all ready for it. I can't ask her to wait because what if if she waits and I am still not ready.

2. I always feel she puts her parents above me. This is very important to me as I grew up alone. I am introverted and I don't have any family that cares much about me or what I do. I've always wanted to be someones ""everything"" ever since I was a little boy. (Her parents don't like me much because I am younger even though I am educated and have a steady and good career)

3. We have no common hobbies. If you asked her and me to list down a perfect day it would have very little in common excluding each other

4. I feel the longer I keep dating the worse it will be if I break up with her. This just increases the pressure on me daily as she has stated she wants to get married eventually. Before dating her I have never even thought of getting married.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on how to proceed would greatly help. I don't want to end up in my 50s wondering where my life went and i'm very scared on what to do next. I love her but this is very overwhelming

It all seems so complicated and is stressing me out.

Thank you in advance.

39,"We only have one mother and one father, and from the moment we were born, we relied on them heavily for everything. A parent’s love is the closest thing resembling unconditional, selfless love that we can find within the universe, and because we have a strong affinity with our parents, we were born into their lives, becoming a significant part of the being.

The special bond we share with our parents is often taken for granted because it’s all we’ve ever known, experiencing their undying love from our very first breath until their very last.

In this article, we share the many ways our parents’ love have impacted our lives and how we can practice filial piety as an expression of our gratitude and appreciation towards them.

Thanks for reading, and may you and your parents be happy, healthy and peaceful 😊❤🙏

50,So I got a phone call a couple days ago from my ex and she was in a bad situation with her new dude. He had her scared for her life.  So I went to help her out because she will always be someone very special in my heart. I found her finally after searching all over for her and I got her on my car and we took off well wouldn't you know physco boyfriend she chose is chasing us. Not to brag but my driving skills are definitely professional and I knew I could out run this guy but I was also scared who knows what the fucker is capable of doing so I was trying to get away from him as soon as possible and get her to safety because she was so out of it. So this is where ima need some legal advice or just some good advice. I was traveling down the road and came up to a shit load of traffic and decided it would be beat if I just used the middle turning lane and try to time out the green light then I could pinch in and he wouldn't be able to... Lucky me I got away from him but an undercover cop light me up like Christmas and I ended up gettin arrested for  reckless driving and impounded my brand new car. I told the officer what was going on but he said I was bullshitting him and that nice try. I.think I was doing the right thing and was running from a greater evil... I just can't afford to pay the fees for everything and 1900 to get my car out of impound andd everything. Please give me some advive,14Jun2019,1
51,"My dad recently visited a weekend festival without my mum coming along. He does this every year with a group of friends he met through similar hobbies. He has always been fond of one of them in particular, there have been moments my mom got very upset over him mentioning her so often. Since then that kinda stopped, recently he is mentioning her a lot again. I don’t really think that is too bad, considering she is a long time family friend by now. 

Anyways, he went to this festival where they slept on a campsite. So that means my dad had to bring clothes, sleepingbag etc.. and: toiletry. We use the same small bag for that. I used it the weekend before him. Now that he is back and I got a new trip coming up, I decided to empty out the bag. To my surprise I found an opened condom pack, without the condom inside of it, of course. I didn’t take any condoms with me on my last trip (it was to a family member) so he put those in there. I can’t help but wonder why he brought them along and even used one without my mum even being there.. Am I too quick to judge here?",14Jun2019,1
52,"I met a woman almost a year ago and we instantly hit it off.

We were on vacation.  Her mom called.  She told her mom she was by herself. While I was standing next to her. 


I told her my favorite holiday was NYE.  She made plans with her sister and didn't even think of inviting me. 


She never once tried to introduce me to her friends.  The only friend I met was solely due to her friend not believing I was real. 


We would take tons of pictures together.  Not 1 would even be on social media.  Only photos of herself.  Vacation photos looked like a solo trip. 


It's been almost a year now... her birthday she decides to have dinner with friends.  Not even once even thinking of inviting her fucking boyfriend. 


Then she has the fucking guts to come over and expect us to break up and still be friends. 


I'm not upset.  I'm angry.  I'm angry I trusted someone when she treated me like a toy she can use and put away wherever she wanted.  I'm angry that I let someone devalue myself as a human being.  I'm angry i worked so hard to love myself. To gain confidence in myself.  Only to see it crumble in to depression and self doubt.  If i love someone and I feel that they're embarrassed about me, maybe there's something I'm lacking.  The doubts, opinions of myself, they crumble with every photo by herself, with every opportunity she passes to introduce me to her friends. 


Looking back at all the red flags... I thought I loved her.  I now realize I said it to try and make her open up and stop hiding me from her world.  I wanted to show that I was fully committed and would never break her heart.  


I couldn't love someone who hid me from her world.  That's not what love is.  That's a hail Mary.  And like most hail Marys, they fail. 


Maybe she was seeing another dude but my gut instinct is that I was a rebound to a guy she liked for a year and got rejected.  She's probably connected to him still on social media and wanted to hide the fact she was in a relationship, hoping he'd change his mind.  


Maybe she was dating other guys.  


Maybe she was just embarrassed and ashamed to think how her friends would judge her about dating me. 


All I know is, I let my walls down for someone who still had hers up.  I let her in to my life while she had her foot out the door. 


I have not shed 1 tear, but the anger I feel is the same anger I've felt when I was cheated on.   And I might've been cheated on.  My reaction would still be the same.  Anger at myself for letting someone get through my walls and tear me apart slowly.",14Jun2019,2

54,"So, my wife's father was (and still is) an alcoholic, basically drinking all the time and was one of the reasons her parents got divorced. Now, I come from a family of alcoholics as well, and for the longest time I didn't touch any alcohol at all.

Now, being 30, I've started to ease myself to a healthy relationship about alcohol. I like the taste of beer, and would like to have one from time to time without getting drunk - I don't enjoy being drunk, I enjoy the taste. However, my wife has an irrational issue with beer both as a concept and as a thing to be near her. She hates the smell and doesn't like it one bit if I have a beer, which is why I don't have any.

I mean, I understand where she's coming from. She has told me that she used to be afraid whenever her mother left her alone with her father, even though her father never hit or abused her in any way. As far as I know, he did black out from drinking quite often and fell down the stairs drunk as hell.

I'd really like to have the occasional beer and learn about the different brews, but even after having a rather good talk with her, she just can't overcome her irrational fears about beer. On a sidenote, it's a tad funny that she doesn't have that kind of a problem with me drinking whisky once or twice a month.",14Jun2019,2
55,"I recently lost a dear friend from Cancer. Both of us were a bit tired of the industry we are working in, Finance. Although we have great jobs and cannot complain on the finance side, we both had long discussions feeling that there was more to life than spending so much time working for money... At the era of social media and e-commerce, the number of people showing how they earn money by working less and having a more flexible life style was always really appealing but I have always been a bit sceptical about the veracity of these ""successful"" drop shippers and other influencers.

I decided to try to balance my life by forcing myself to do more, live more, experience more, travel more, share more, meet more people. My plan? Creating a YouTube channel where I would be ticking off items from my bucket list, vlogging my trips and encouraging people to join the movement by also running small projects to go and directly help some selected individuals to reach their goals and dreams. 
Why a YouTube channel? Because I am a firm believer that in order to achieve your goals you have to commit to yourself and others! No way to back out now that I told people my plan!

How it feels so far? Good but tiring!

I love what I do, it is more creative that my job in Finance in London, everything I do comes from my imagination and my hands! I do whatever I feel like doing and I learn SO MUCH! I am also ticking off items from my bucket list in the process, more than I did in the past 5 years, in 5 months!

The issue? My friends around me, most of them working as lawyers or in finance, doctors etc do NOT understand... And it is hard sometimes to explain that I could potentially turn it to a business one day and even if I dont, the simple fact it gives me balance for now is ENOUGH for me to keep doing it!

I have always been super creative and always liked helping other people and having already a small impact on a tiny amount of people have helped me feeling good!

This year I have tried flyboarding, I drove my childhood dream car, I am raising money for Cancer Research UK (already £6k+), I will be climbing the Kilimanjaro, all that because I committed infront of thousands of people! These are things I always wanted to do!

I dont care what my friends think and will keep on doing it but not always having their support is disappointing.

My friend wanted out, and wanted to start living more, to the fullest... She had not this chance, I want to use my time wisely going forward.

I feel like there are so many of us forgetting that we are not immortal so fuck it, just do what you love and if you can live from it, dont care too much about not being a millionaire, your soul will be the rich one and this is more than enough!

Love!",14Jun2019,129

58,"Hello. I currently have a severe depresive episode ( or at least this is what I've been diagnosed with). I struggle with depression for 5 years now ( possibly more, it's been 5 years though since I was diagnosed with it). I went through therapy, but it didn't do much for me. I had the traditional cognitive-behaviour therapy, where I'd be asked to do little homeworks ( keep a journal and other small chores). I oftenly had trouble with doing that, as I felt it was a chore, more than it was something to help me. I couldn't write at all, as I hate myself, and just the thought of talking to myself it's pointless to me. I found it stupid sadly, and was unable to do it. I understand how it could have helped. A couple of years into therapy, me and my therapist hit a dead end, I'd go in, repeat myself, he'd say the same things, nothing would change. I did became more conscious about things as a result, but it doesn't changes the way I feel about myself. Fast forward, I have now a severe depressive episode, am very suicidal ( making plans daily), I keep getting asked why I don't go to therapy by my boyfriend, and when I answer that it doesen't helps me, I end up feeling like I dissapoint even more. P.S. : I have been to several doctors, phsychiatrists etc. for therapy, and my experience overall with it wasn't pleasant, nor that helpful. I had a therapist who forgot about me and a therapist who told me that "" why do you have these thoughts, what is wrong with you, you have to be put in the hospital, it's not right for a 21 year old to have these thoughts"". It also makes me very anxious, I feel like I have to be alright to go to therapy, I feel like I either bore the person I am talking to or they'd rather not be there. I am sorry for this long useless post. Does anyone else has issues like this with traditional therapy?",14Jun2019,2
59,"I'm sure there's another subreddit where this would belong better and this post will be more of a vent than anything else, although I am curious to see if anyone else has felt this way.

When looking online or even in real life, by far the most common piece of advice given for fighting depression is exercise. This advice is something I could never comprehend. From the moment I wake up all that's on my mind is knowing I'll have to work out, while I am exercising I am constantly hating myself waiting for it to be over, and when I'm finally done for the day a mental clock turns in my head ticking down the time until I have to do it all over again. This recent health binge is the most dedicated I've been, having tried multiple times over the years working out for months at a time but I always slowly fade away from it. Running, swimming, hitting the gym, I hate it all so so much. Never experienced a ""runners high"" or those endorphins from a good workout. 

I began getting fit at the start of the new year and right now I'm probably in the best shape I've ever been and it means absolutely nothing to me. I'm happiest when eating junk food and right now all I have to look forward to is the two cheat days I give myself a month. By working out I prolong my life which means there will only be more days where I have to work out and I just don't see the point anymore.",14Jun2019,2

I finally worked up the courage to say something, and we kind of both agreed to guess who we liked (I kind of knew she liked me), and eventually I said something like ‘they have slightly darker hair than me’ and she said ‘they have slightly lighter hair than me’, a word for word copy of what I said albeit the opposite.

I asked ‘do you like me?’ And she stayed kind of quiet and said ‘maybe. I don’t know’ and I told her I really liked her too. She finally breathed and said she felt the same, and after that we were talking about what would happen. It was awkward, but really good. 

I told some of my close friends what happened, which was really nice as well.

Just being candid (because I can be with you awesome people), the realities of life &amp; obligation have left me with nobody to invite out or get well-wishes from on this afternoon off. My grandparents would usually text me something sweet today, but 3 of my 4 have passed in the last year, and my one surviving grandparent is bedridden and not much of a texter. Maybe I'll visit her, she'd probably cry from sheer gratefulness of me choosing to spend *my* birthday sitting &amp; talking with her, something that not many others in the family think to do even on normal days, which really heavies my heart sometimes since I live a lot farther away from her than my sisters, cousins, and other family that she'd be so grateful to see any day.

85,"NSFW, will have mere mentions of self harm, and suicide.  
TL;DR will be at the end of the post, this is just some more background info which you can skip

&amp;#x200B;

Hello everyone! So I finally have decided that it's time for me to start going to a therapist, I've never been *officially* diagnosed but I've been having the symptoms of clinical depression for.. well.. forever, I don't recall a time where I didn't feel like shit, or times where I didn't think of suicide. I *did* attempt suicide before by jumping but broke my hip bone and wasn't able to walk or move for about a year because of it, which you guess it, made my life even more shittier.   
I also *used* to do self-harm, I only did it once or twice and they were during major mental breakdowns, only.  


So anyway, right now my life is going a bit better than before but at the same time, weirdly as it sounds, it is going worse as well. I've had a mental breakdown just last week where I was an inch close to suicide, but my girlfriend as if she *knew,* she messaged me asking how am I doing.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want anyone I'm close to to know about my feelings and suicidal thoughts, even when they probably will help me, I still wouldn't want to, my girlfriend and one close friend of mine knows more than others, and that I've attempted suicide before. But in general I don't want to trouble them with my own luggage.  
SO, I really don't want to die, yet I want to *run away* from life. I've finally decided to go to a therapist, someone whom I could talk to about my thoughts, without worrying whether they judge me. I also finally am financially cape-able of doing so *(Big thanks to one reddit user who came out of nowhere, and kept insisting to donate to help me, not only was I able to fix my apartment problems but now I can afford therapy for few months.* *^(I know if I started therapy it'll probably be better if I kept going to it, which I plan to and have been looking for a job to pay for my future sessions by myself)**)*

But I'm unsure how will I approach the problem, because usually with normal doctors, they ask you what are you feeling, what sort of pain and the like. But with a therapist, is it just *Hi I'm ThatUselessNPC, and I want to kill myself, please help.* ?  
What exactly is the approach here, what should I tell the therapist when I first enter the room, what would the therapist possibly do, and how do they actually diagnose the issue? I've looked for online articles and I'm more confused than before, so I thought directly asking might be better. Also, should I directly tell the therapist about my suicidal issues? I've heard of people involuntarily getting hospitalized for their issues, and I don't want that at all. Should I hide the fact that I'm facing suicidal issues for the first few sessions, and start with my simple problems? *Can I even trust a therapist to keep the info between me and them?*  


TL;DR: I've decided to go to a therapist to deal with my suicidal thoughts and attempts, but I have no idea how to approach it, do I just go *Hi I'm sad plz help*  or is there a more *professional* way of doing it, without making it more awkward than it already is. what should I tell the therapist when I first go to them? how do they diagnose issues? can I trust that a therapist w*on't* leak the issues that I have to someone that I know?",14Jun2019,1

90,"I've been going to a pet store to get my cat and dog food for almost 7 months now. There is a girl there that I find really pretty. We chat and I flirt with her everytime I go in. Two months ago I decided I wanted to ask her out for coffee or something casual, but everytime I go in with confidence my head held high. I go up to her say hello and casually chat with her. She checks me out and when she bags the items I think""now's my time.... To run away"" and that's what I do. 

I really want to go out and get to know her. I guess what holding me back are my doubts, fears and what ifs. Like what if she she is only nice to me because I'm a customer. But then again she memorized my name for their loyalty program.  She always makes a point to say hi and help me everytime I go in. I've tempted when she checks me out to ask for a pen and the receipt write my number down and say something like ""here's my number. If you want to get coffee and chat text me 😊"" 

It has been almost 6 years since I asked a woman out in person. Modern technology makes it so much easier to ask a girl out online since you don't have to face them. Aka an excuse

I'm 32.  I have a great job the pays really well.  I have the big house in the nice neighborhood - 2 car garage, fenced yard, all that stuff.  I have a beautiful wife and the smartest puppy that I trained and love so much.  In December, we decided to start having kids.  I thought I had everything figured out and was living the life I always dreamed.  It was all on track.

&amp;#x200B;

Two weeks ago, my wife told me she had fallen out of love with me.  She said there is no one else - just that she doesn't love me any more.  She is moving out next week, we're getting divorced next month, and as part of our agreement, she is taking the dog with her.

&amp;#x200B;

Next week, the 2 most important beings in my life are walking out the door and not coming back.  I'm trying to stay focused on all the good things I will still have in my life and the positives I have going on, but damn this feeling of loss and starting over feels as heavy as anything I've ever gone through before.  It is hard to even breathe.",14Jun2019,4
92,"I feel as though I have been carrying a secret within me, for my whole life. But I never knew what the secret was exactly. But I think I've figured it out. I am just an inherently awful person. I am a compulsive liar, selfish, and just overall terrible. My list of unforgivable sins is so overwhelming, and I know I can never fix most of them. It's making me begin to question my overall sanity, and what is real and what isn't. I am in love with my best friend, and want to have sex with him so badly. And I am constantly lying and doing things I wouldn't regularly do to impress him, and make him like me. For example, I have an old family friend named Leo, who I see about once every two years, at functions or when we schedule spending time together; which is extremely rare. But, I tell my best friend that Leo and I hang out frequently, and that when my family friend was in college, he used to take me to the college parties and that I used to drink and smoke and party really hard, to make myself seem cooler, even though I never did, and never even stepped foot on my family friends college campus. Another freakish thing I do is troll on Reddit sex pages, snap chat men and send them nudes, but lie about myself and my age, and if they do things that irritate me or ask for full body pictures, I just block them. (I don't like sending pictures of my whole body because I'm self conscious) I don't even really feel guilty about it, and even when I do it's more about lying, than blocking them. The even worse part about this, is that I have a girlfriend. I have brought up to her recently having an open relationship, but I then had relations with a boy, (which did not go well, he harassed me and ended things the next day because he had a monogamous girlfriend of two years that he did not tell me about, and a mutual friend of ours told everyone that we hooked up and made things very public, and since then I have had arguments with both the boy I hooked up with and our friend.) but when I tried to tell my girlfriend about these relations, she got pissed and totally froze up and didn't talk to me for a really long time, and we're just now starting to move on from it. But it did really suck because I was trying to communicate with her, and also talk to someone about being raped, and she just got mad. So god knows how she'd react if I told her I was snapchating and sexting men (who are significantly older than me) and have been for a while. Also with my best friend I'm unsure of what to do. He has recently entered a relationship, and I am really happy for him, but also get a little jealous. I hang out with him and his girlfriend together all the time, and most of the time seeing them together doesn't upset me or make me uncomfortable, I'm really happy for the two of them, I just feel a little sad and a little envious. I think my feelings for my friend (we'll call him Jared) have always been there, and when we first started talking, I was so nervous when we spoke or hung out, and was pretty obsessed with him. Obviously I still am very attracted to him, but my feelings have died down a little bit. It's just when certain things happen, I realize just how strongly I still feel about him. Examples, whenever I sleep at his house and we're in the same bed, and we even briefly brush legs or touch each other a little bit, my heart races. Another time I realized how I felt was on New Years eve, we were getting drunk together and watching the ball drop, and when it was midnight, he grabbed my hand and kissed it, and slurred ""a homie kiss for you"" and then stumbled into the bathroom and puked for the rest of the night, but in that moment I couldn't have been more happy, even though I spent most of the night cleaning up his vomit, I remember the night very fondly, and wish I could feel the way I felt when he kissed my hand forever. It stung a little when he friend zoned me so harshly, but at the same time holding his hand and feeling his lips and breath on my skin sent me to the moon. The real kicker is that we used to have a mutual friend named Asher, and one time I was hanging out with Asher, and she asked, ""Whatever happened between you and Jared?"" When I asked her what she meant, she explained when Jared and I were first becoming close, he thought we were going to form a romantic relationship, not a platonic one, and had told Asher that he was attracted to me. I now desperately hope if Jared ever breaks up with his girlfriend, to bring this up, and tell him how I feel, and how when Asher told me that almost a year ago, it gave me some strange hope. Am I insane? Most likely. But I'd love an outside perspective and some insight as to why I do these things. Please feel free to comment or pm me :)",14Jun2019,1

I  just turned away abruptly and didn’t say anything.

95,"This is so great.

One of the restrooms was closed for maintenance yesterday. There was a sign on the door that says ""closed for maintenance"" as well as yellow tape and cones blocking the door.

Anyways, I went back down to this restroom today to take a shit and noticed that the tape and cones were gone, but the sign was still on the door.  So naturally I tested to see if the door was unlocked and... it was!

Walked inside and all the automatic lights came on, so I know that no one else has been inside the restroom for at least an hour or so.  The restroom was clean and orderly, no cleaning or construction equipment sitting around, all the toilet seats were up and the toilets full of soap.  Looks to me like they cleaned up the bathroom after doing the maintenance and that no one else has used it since.

So I took a gamble that the maintenance was actually complete, just that they hadn't removed the sign, and so... I proceeded.  Flushed a toilet just to make sure the plumbing was in order and now I'm taking a shit on a pristine and private throne.",14Jun2019,1

The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then look away to carry on putting her scarf on.

103,"I'm a 24 y/o Muslim Indian American male. A few years ago I became friends with an Indian American Muslim woman who finished her undergrad in 2016 after studying social and political sciences. Since then, she has self-published two books and spoken at various events internationally. 

I read her first book when it came out. I didn't like it. It was a story about a dystopian future in which a few Muslim women prove their strength and courage in overcoming stereotypes held by white Americans in the story. I thought the story was one-dimensional and it could've been written in a month or two. The themes were basic, simple, and boring. They're also basically spelled out in front of the reader through the dialogue and writing (the exact opposite of ""show don't tell"" that writers should adhere to). For example, the narrator tells the reader things like ""These Muslim women are fearless. How does that change your views as a reader?"" The themes are about as trite as ""Tolerance, peace, and love triumph over hatred and prejudice. Racism and sexism are bad."" Seriously? The book seemed to spoon-feed us what mankind has known for centuries and maybe even seems pretentious it would assume the reader is an Islamophobic ignoramus that thinks all Muslim women are weak. If anything, the book just seems like her own political opinions crafted into a book. And I'm a Muslim saying this. 

On top of that, it was triple-spaced with huge margins to make it look like it was longer/bigger than it actually was. Regardless of what the author's intention was with that decision, it just comes across as lazy. It really seemed to me like she wanted the prestige and power of calling herself an author at a very young age so she wrote this book in a few months and published it. Regardless, the book has gotten attention in various countries and the woman now speaks at events, as I've mentioned. 

But I wonder if I'm just thinking these negative things because I'm jealous that she's a published author. I say this because I'm also a writer and hope to someday publish a book. I wonder if I'm jealous that she's getting so much attention for her writing. She wrote a progressive book about diversity and inclusion, and those things should be celebrated. We should be encouraging young writers, especially ones of marginalized groups, to get their voices out there. I wonder if my cynical view would be more harmful. I've never told her my true thoughts about her book, but I've told these thoughts to a few of my friends.

104,"This week has been a rollercoaster. Just kinda venting. I’ll try to keep it as short as possible. TL/DR at the bottom. On mobile, blah blah. 

TW: rape/sexual abuse. 

Monday: I was sexually assaulted. This brought up some intense memories from a traumatic rape from when I was a teenager. I was so depressed I could hardly move. Going to work was giving me panic attacks. 

Wednesday: I called my therapist for an emergency meeting. I was actually able to confront the past and I knew I had to confront this guy. He was a huge help.

Thursday: Petrified, I went to his house (he’s a neighbor of my client, whose home I work in). I stayed way back, shaking, and I told him exactly how he made me feel, and I stood firm. He’s 80, I didn’t know what to expect. He gave me a full apology and thanked me for telling him, and said that I did the right thing. 

I. WAS. STUNNED. I thanked him, and left feeling the most empowered I’ve ever felt. It was like confronting him and my past attacker at the same time. I said what I needed to say and have always wanted to say. 

Today: It’s 1pm and I’ve already cleaned the house, gotten laundry done, paid all the bills, got myself up and dressed, and have been doing yard work for the last 3 hours. I actually feel awesome and productive today. 

I love those days/weeks/months when you are able to feel a little more normal. It’s amazing to be lifted and empowered from your depression and anxiety, even if only for a moment. I had a huge win this week come from something awful. It’s ok to confront your feelings and your past. It’s helps once in a while. 

Thanks for reading, I just felt I wanted to share this story. Love and good vibes to all. 

TL/DR: sexual assault led to traumatic week, which led to me being able to confront things, and now my depression and anxiety are at bay because I feel empowered for once.",14Jun2019,3
105,"I have been prescribed and taking adderall for several years. I started taking it during my sophomore year of college (7ish years ago). Though, 2013-2015 I stopped taking adderall and the doctor prescribed me vyvanse instead and used that until I graduated in 2015. I got myself prescribed for adderall again once I started graduate school May 2018. I really only used it on those days that I had a paper to write and never used it on weekends so I would just save the remaining and add it to the new batch. About 8 months ago my work load and school load just became too much and I found myself taking adderall more. The doctor gave me 30 mg and 10mg if needed, but I would sometimes take 20 instead. 

A couple of months ago I began seeing a psychiatrist and she prescribed me sertraline, seroquil, and vyvanse (lowest dosage). It was towards the end of the semester so it was crazy, so I would take my 30 mg adderall at 7:00 am, around noon I would take vyvanse, and around 4:30 I would take 10mg adderall and then I would take another 30mg several hours later. I only did that a couple of times and those were for nights I knew I would be up all night working. 

I’ve never felt that “high” when taking these. I guess physically, my body feels light?? And it does feel nice but it’s not like I’m craving it.  I don’t know how to explain it. I can definitely go without taking any (if I don’t have a lot of homework). But when I do take it I realize i sometimes take more than needed, but it’s always several hours apart so I don’t know if that would even be considered abusing the drug even though it is 3 different types of stimulant, it’s still in moderation? 

Anyway, I really don’t know or think this is something I should be concerned about but I guess I wanted to make sure.",14Jun2019,1

113,"When emo started, only people into Hardcore punk and few other music nerds knew what it was. Emo is a genre of music with introspective lyrics and often very emotional vocals. To me this was huge. Some songs already had an emotional and introspective side, but this wasn't that intense. This was mostly made by young adults, going to DIY shows, screaming poetry til exhaustion, eventually influencing future pop music in 00s... **but when it went pop, everything went wrong.** We went from a great underground artistic movement to scene kids wearing make-up and looking like clowns ? **Why do people need to butcher everything by focusing on the** ***look*** **rather than the essence.** It was a great opportunity to learn about punk and new music rather than stealing the aesthetics.

&amp;#x200B;

Next is the hipster trend. Hipster was actually great : being ""eco-friendly"", being closer to nature, buying local rather than big corporations... but what people understood **OH YEAH THESE WEIRD PEOPLE WITH BEARDS ? ahaha so stupid...** and that's all. Now big cities are filled with lame barber shops/coffee shop with a fake ""indie"" look. Again, it was a great opportunity to discover ""DIY"" stuff, indie music, traditionnal stuff...

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of mocking these subcultures, try to understand what's great about them. If the next big trend is jazz, I won't be stealing the look only to look ""cool"", I'll try understanding what it is, and often these subcultures have a great history behind.

114,"We are together 4 years and in that time I've had a depressive episode that lasted about a year. My partner helped me get through with it, supported me and stopped me from killing myself. We live together for two years now.

Fastforward, I'm about 2 years after my episode and about to end my therapy. My partner has just started his therapy (about a month before now) and has doubts about our relationship. He says that he sees it as mainly focused on my emotions and needs (which is true and I wish to change that), wants to concentrate fully on his needs and prioritize himself. I accept that and I'm ready to wait, give him time, in order to discover himself and maybe build something new.

What if we'll never get together tho? Now, after a week of something like peace and building something new, when we functioned like a couple and communicated, he once again (like a week ago) wanted to take a break - a few days with no contact with each other. Before, we decided to try it once again, to create something new and not based on only one of us' needs. He feels anger and resentment towards me, I'm wondering whether it's possible to actually start anew and be able to actually function as a relationship once again. This break was proposed (and accepted by me) every week now, after his therapy session.

Is it a relationship if there are breaks every week? He said he was glad we didn't break up last week, and yet now he wants a break once again. Should I break up with him?",14Jun2019,1
115,"So this whole story is based around my girlfriend who I recently started dating because I think the whole story for how we got together is crazy. Not in a bad way, I just can't believe life actually worked out like this. So here goes!

&amp;#x200B;

Last March, I was in math class with some of my friends, and one of these friends (we'll call her F) happened to be really close to the girl who I'm now dating (we'll call her GF). Basically at this point, I knew that GF existed, I'd seen her like maybe once or twice ever, and all I really knew was that I thought she was really cute. Then one day I found out that F was one of GF's best friends, so I asked F to set me up with her. F told me to just talk to her myself and to try and get the ball rolling, but I didn't have the guts to do that and I didn't even think GF knew who I was, so I didn't really do anything about it. Eventually, I happened to be in the same place as F and GF, so F introduced us.

&amp;#x200B;

About a month later, there were group interviews for students who wanted to help out with freshman orientation, and lo and behold, I ended up in the same group as GF. That was the first time we actually talked to each other on more of a level than waving hello to each other as we passed each other in the halls, but not much came out of it in the end. Summer passed, and most of the school year passed, and we talked very rarely, but there were occasional times where we'd see each other and say hey or something. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, this past March, it was spring break. Captain Marvel had recently come out, and since I'm a superhero nerd, I saw it on opening night. When spring break rolled around, I checked Instagram and saw that GF put something on her story of her friend referencing a song from the movie that was in a famous vine (""wait, oh yes, wait a minute Mr. Postman""). Having already seen the movie, I knew what she was talking about, so I replied to her story for some reason. That's something I don't usually do in any case, but I just figured that there was nothing to lose and that it was a casual conversation. After I replied, she asked me what I thought of the movie (though I never told her, she somehow knew that I loved superheroes, and having that reputation made me extra happy). As we were talking about, she told me that she hadn't seen any Marvel movies outside of Captain Marvel, Infinity War, and some of Black Panther.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't expect what happened next to work in any way, but it did.

&amp;#x200B;

I told her that I'd help her catch up on the MCU since Endgame was coming up and offered to watch the movies with her. She said yes! So a few nights later, she came over and we put on Iron Man, but we ended up talking to each other the whole time instead, which was really fun. Then I asked her on a real date that night, and she said yes again! I took her to a nice restaurant and we had a good time, but at this point life was starting to get super busy for both of us. She brought it up to me that she thought we were both really busy people and that a relationship probably wasn't the best idea at the time. I was on the same page and agreed, so we stayed friends for a little bit. We hung out a couple times, and though I still kind of wanted something more, I knew that for the time being, it was better the way it was.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, it got better. In the middle of May, she asked me if I wanted to go get smoothies with her, and figuring it was just a casual thing, I said yes. So we were just sitting outside talking when she said something I'm still in awe about. She asked if I wanted to try out the relationship side of us, and I said yes. I kept my composure on the outside, but internally I was beyond excited. I still don't have words to describe what it felt like to hear that from her. Because we were trying it out, I said that we didn't have to put any labels on it until we knew we were ready. Over the following few weeks, we spent a lot of time together and our relationship basically grew to the point of us being an official couple without making it official. So last week, we decided that we wanted to make it official, and now I'm dating her. I still can't believe it's real, but it is and I'm beyond happy about it.",14Jun2019,1

118,"A few years ago I was super obese. My favorite shit was snacking literally all day. I used to eat cookies, cake, pie, milk, etc all day long. I enjoyed eating out so much. 

I decided to stop taking my parents food (they were the ones who encouraged being fat) and I lost the weight. I still struggled to control my cravings but I got through. I shipped off to boot camp and I gained so much weight from the stress and generally unhealthy food.

124,"Well I definitely didn’t know where to post this, so I came here. Anyway I have a funny little story and maybe a glimmer of hope for reconnection with old friends. 

As we all know from the explosion of meme references, ROBLOX is basically a combination of Minecraft, Legos, and Club Penguin type children’s social shit. I have no idea what the gameplay is like anymore, but in its heyday it was honestly quite great entertainment. You got to create your own worlds, and if you had any programming skill, could make very complex games — zombie games, war tycoons, obstacle courses, the works. As a kid that grew up with LEGO and Bionicles and had yet to experience Minecraft, ROBLOX kept me busy on rainy days all the way until I was 10 or so. 

But the funny thing about this website was that it had a mostly-forgotten forum section. So as I was inching closer to my teens and developing my own interests in books, music, movies, etc., I ended up stumbling onto those forums. And while the actual game of ROBLOX faded into a childhood memory, posting on the forums of the website became a regular hobby. I started off on the Off Topic forum; which was cool, but it had a huge community, so it was a little more like reddit at times. Then, after a few months of posting in that one, I found my niche in the music forum. 

Thanks to the fact that ROBLOX was still a children’s website, I ventured into the music forum with a fresh username after my account was permanently deleted (I can only imagine the obscenities my LEGO knockoff avatar was spewing). And on the music forum, I made my home for years. Because your account’s age is displayed directly under your avatar on the forums, I know my account was created in 2009. After an accidental satanic comment and more bans, I remember having new accounts all the way up to 2011, and I reckon I may have posted through 2012, to give a timeframe here. 

During those years, I can honestly say that the forums of ROBLOX helped me find myself. I never had a family that was big into music — my dad was a pop culture fanatic in general who loved all the classic movies and bands but wasn’t into much that everyone didn’t already know about, and my mom seemed to actively despise art. Siblings were never musical either, and thus I really had no way to get a foot in the door of the musical world; until now. The people on these forums were shockingly knowledgeable and just by hanging around there for a while I was opened up to a universe of music. 

Looking back on it, the fact that I was a clueless fourteen year old listening to Captain Beefheart and Tom Waits because I found them on a ROBLOX forum is actually fucking hilarious. Thanks to this forum I discovered artists that remain my favorites 8 years later and probably always will be; Bjork, The Avalanches, John Coltrane, Can, The Flaming Lips, Modest Mouse, Joanna Newsom, The Velvet Underground, Talking Heads... yep, it’s ROBLOX that turned me onto these great musicians in my early teens. Because of these influences, I started playing guitar, learning how to sample, and writing my own music. I even sent files back and forth with a couple ROBLOX users to mix our own retrospectively godawful song we made together thousands of miles away. Now at 21 I’m working on my second album, and I’m thinking back to those forums now and how much they shaped my musical development as a teenager. Who knows how my musical development would have shaped without it.

Aside from the music itself, this forum also helped me through some rough early teen years. I’ll admit I can be stubborn and like to hold my ground, and combined with the fact that I was a proponent of sexual freedom and believed in dinosaurs, that didn’t fit too will with the catholic school I went to that had only 37 kids in my class. So when I was a 14 year old freshman some of my best friends were ROBLOX users. It wasn’t always about the music, it was also somewhere to go and feel safe, somewhere where people care about your interests actually want to know what you have to say. Somewhere you can just be yourself.

When my childhood friend killed himself and my grandfather died within the same month when I was 14, my biggest support system was the friends I met on the internet to talk about music. I’m not sure if I even told them, but just having someone to talk to that was removed from the rest of my world was what I needed. Rather than go into the tragedies, I just want to appreciate how wonderfully odd humanity can be sometimes — that complete strangers could be the emotional rock for someone in a time of crisis, especially strangers united through fucking ROBLOX — is a beautiful thing. 

Eventually, my school built a new building in a different neighborhood and tripled in size, and my life got a little easier. I also probably just started to think the idea of posting on ROBLOX was ridiculously childish at 15 or 16 even if I wasn’t playing the games. Now I think it was childish to think it was childish but you know what they say about hindsight. Anyways, there were a few forums everyone migrated to as we matured, but they already had their own userbases and we never really found a new smaller space for our little group of regulars. I used to follow one guy on twitter until I deleted my account and then that was it. 

So here I am, 10 years after the beginning of this story. It’s been at least 5 since I’ve spoken with anyone from ROBLOX and I honestly have no idea how one would go about finding anyone now. But that’s part of this post, so I’m gonna throw a couple usernames out into the wind just to see. It does sometimes seem like half of the world uses reddit anyway. 

allyourbasearebelong2us, EmancipationSuite, Crash, Phoenix, Ice... I am probably forgetting people but if you recognize those names and associate them with ROBLOX, then I am sure that I am talking about you too. 

Anyway, I just wanted to share this story because I’m feeling sentimental right now and I really appreciate everything these guys did for me, along with influencing me to become the musician I am today. Along with the slight chance someone from the forums sees this. 

I know this is a long post but I figured what the hell, this is the self subreddit. I tried to at least write with some flavor so hope you enjoyed. 

TLDR: long after I stopped playing ROBLOX, hung around on the forums to talk about music. Inspired me to become the musician I am today and also was a great group of friends through my early teens",14Jun2019,3

So, I’ve been saving. I have about 10.5k in the bank saved up. Long term I want to buy a house. Short term I want a motorcycle. There’s the 2 sides of me that are battling each other atm. 

1. What I want right now is a motorcycle. Why? I’ve had a depression childhood with absolutely zero time to be a kid. While everyone was worried about getting or not getting that new superhero action figure for Xmas I was worried about when my next beating would be and how I could get away without being killed. I was acting like an adult by tbh 10 years. Motorcycle= irresponsible. I’m a speed junkie and = literally countless hours of fun. 

2. What I want long term is settle down. This is my responsible side. Saving = being an adult. Shit you have no idea how much its taken me to save up that amount. While my friends are out parting I’m in here trying to save every last penny to my name. 

Either way, I know I’ll regret my choice. What if I had gotten that motorcycle and for once in my life being immature? Doing something that makes me happy. Or what if I had saved up sooner? I could’ve probably paid off the mortgage by now and debt free.",14Jun2019,0

I'm 22 years old and a working female. All my colleagues and friends all have just these things to say now that we're approaching ""that"" age:
-&gt; I'm never getting married!
-&gt; I'm never having kids!
-&gt; I'm commitment-phobic.

I try to explain to them that one day, they'll be singing a different tune, but they refuse to accept that they'll change. That someone will come along who will be so worth it that they'll start imagining having a family with that person. They think their career is too important and they're too busy for this. I am too. But I know that life isn't just about a job.

I've been dumped three times by now, so it does make me think that maybe I'm not an easy person to be with. It does make me think I might end up alone.

But it STILL doesn't really stop me from thinking, ""Nah, Mr. Right is right around the corner!"" and imagining a beautiful future with the next guy I meet. It's not a scary thought at all: the whole idea of living with just one guy for the rest of my life and having kids with him, and going through parenthood. I'm not saying I want to give up on my career. Don't get me wrong: I've set pretty good targets for myself and I intend to achieve them. But knowing that I can come back to a loving husband and two trouble-makers after a hard day of work sounds perfect.

But sometimes, it's just easier to say, ""Ugh, me neither. Who wants to get married and have annoying brats run around the house?"" when my friends talk about disliking the idea of marriage. I pretend I understand them and agree with them because otherwise, I feel left out.

Sometimes I think it's because my mom tells me that marriage is the best thing that happened to her. She had a very bad childhood and she still has nightmares about it. Marrying my father opened up this new world to her where she was free to do anything, she had control over her life and she had a husband and in-laws who adored her. I have been fortunate enough to have grown up in a very caring household and I can't imagine tearing away from my parents to marry someone.

(THey provide vouchers for interview clothes) I replied politely (I’m very quiet) ‘yes, Iv got all that' and she said 'oh have you got all that?’ (upbeat as I said) I said yes then she went on to say 'ok well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes, (she moved her hands also while saying this accordingly) make sure you get a shave, make sure you cut your nails..make sure you do your hair up all nice and that.....(then she paused as she was facing her computer) ..'and make sure you put some aftershave on aswell, for the girls make sure it's mens' then burst out laughing, she’s never even smiled before (I just smiled along with it) I a young guy and she’d in her early 30s. Just really worried she thinks I'm Ugly and that I stink. I did need a shave which maybe why but I always showered as normal and was clean I just hadn’t shaved this once and had easy wear layabout clothes on :/ she also put in the email ‘please dress smartly’ underlined. But she also chose me for 2 interviews and didn’t say that anything about appearance at all the 2nd time",14Jun2019,1
141,"All people should be treated fairly and equally. No human is less deserving of their rights just because they are a different sex , race , nationality etc. However to claim that women and men are the same mentally and emotionally ( outside of a few exceptions) is false and can be dangerous .

 there are destinct differences between men and women , its not a social construct, its nature . men are usually more aggressive , dominating larger and more muscular because we were the ones that had to fight and hunt. Women are attracted to a strong dominating men ( usually) because it provides safety for them and their children . in nature the women take care of children because a baby/ small child can't be away from the mother as they are totally dependent on their mothers for survival . so the men must be the ones to hunt and protect . which requires the ""aggresive"" masculine traits. 

Its only in our modern world that we are able to step out of the roles that we evolved to fill. But just because we have the freedom to doesn't mean that we can just overcome millions of years of evolution. 

We can't overcome the core characteristics of our nature. Men and women are equal , but we are built different from each other for a reason",14Jun2019,0

144,"Hey, so let me start by saying i'm 21 years old, ate nothing but junk food all my life and never gained any weight, i was at 55KG or 121 Pounds for so many years, im 5' 7"", but recently ( since 2018 ) i've noticed that i've gained 5 KGs or 11 pounds in last 1.5 years!

I used to lift weights, got some biceps (next to nothing really, but they exist)  but stopped cuz i'm lazy af....now it seems i've got a pot belly with man boobs, and my rib cage STILL shows over my skin!, i'm still that underweight yet im fat!

I measured my intake for a week, and i eat 2000 Calories average, 37% fat (105g), 55% Carbs (350g) of that 120g sugars), 55g Proteins, i dont eat any meat, not because meat is murder lol, i just dont like the taste except for chicken, i only eat bread which is (50% wholewheat plus 50% plain flour)..i love sweet things in life (who dosent) like sodas...but i've been drinking those since i was 13, on daily basis, and never have I gained any weight (until 2018), instead stayed underweight that my ribcage was showing over my skin...

Anyway, sorry about my bad english, non native i am....and also if this is a common..reddit?...but talk to me as if you're talking to a fitness retard. Seriously i know nothing except for sit-ups, push-ups, and simple stuff like that!

146,"So, funny story, (not really)

I’m at fort lee which is an army base and holy mother of god. They’re so annoying. It’s beyond annoying. They’re obnoxious and belligerent as fuck. 

1. They have absolutelyZERO discipline. 
2. Their IT is ONE 30 second plank or 5 push ups. 
3.  Holy fuck, they back talk so much. We would’ve been slapped across the floor for that. 
4. During their “marches” they sing... what the fuck is this? Summer camp? 
5. I witnessed a couple of privates making fun of their first sgt.. I was like “what the actual fuck?”
6. Loud as fuck and believe me, not in the good way. 
7. They give zero shits about their uniforms, looks like a bag of ass. 
8. They’re either obese or bone skinny. Most being obese. If these are the people who I’m supposed to be collaborating with and who’s supposed to have my back then I rather go in alone, I might last a couple minutes more. 
9. Their “high knees” are shit. If I would’ve done that shit during boot camp we would’ve been slapped. 

A buttload more. 

Before coming here I asked my friend for advice on fort lee (he’s army) at the time I was like “the battle for who’s Better is stupid, we’re all the same” but fuck no. He said “marines get more freedom, just for being Marines, army not as much and we have to earn it” after witnessing this theater for a couple of weeks I’m like “FUCK NO. we EARN more freedom by fucking behaving you undisciplined *****, and y’all wonder why -.-“",14Jun2019,3
147,"Last night he cussed me out in my faced then punched my friend several times for telling him to calm down. Later he pushed me into a wall. He said some really low down hurtful things in the midst.

All day I've just been so heart broken and upset over it. He's the type to hurt people then go to a different set of friends who aren't apart of the drama. He's a people pleaser and everyone just likes and forgives him for his bullshit. I just wanted everyone to see the type of person he is. I'm sure people already know... I wrote a post on my instagram story about people who wear crystals and burn sage but possess anger and fight people. i hinted at his username so everyone knows who im referring to.

I deleted it after 20 minutes and I think only 20ish people saw. I know it's not a lot but people talk/screenshot. I instigated the situation more and stooped to his petty level which I'm upset with myself for now. This is exactly why I was staying off instagram in the first place. Just gets me in trouble...",14Jun2019,1

149,"Hey guys! Im not sure where to specifically ask this but decided to ask here. Also I’m hoping someone responds I know most of the time posts get barely any attention.

I feel like I’ve been really dependent on others when it came to fulfilling myself. I know social interaction is healthy and vital but I feel that I’ve relied on it too heavily to make myself happy. In terms of dating and friendships

Now, after a relationship I went through that was long distance and a nightmare, I just wanna get used to being alone. 

I left a group chat of mine. Unfortunately I alarmed them and I told one person my reasoning, they didn’t reply back yet. Not sure if they will but I mean being in a group chat about dating and having people talk about their successful dates and SO’s.. not necessarily jealous but I feel a bit bad that I can’t have that.


However, despite that, I am beginning to self actualize that my negative thoughts are the farthest from the truth. So I feel that I need to work on myself alone to get there. And having constant reminders of negative thoughts doesn’t really help so I distanced myself from anything that caused that.

Overall, main point, I wanna get used to being by myself again and not seek validation from social interactions anymore. It’s a process and I know probably bad to isolate but I feel like being in that chat about dating just pushed false negativity in my mind so I left for good. I’ve been mostly doing stuff on my own, reading and hopefully going to unfreeze my gym membership as well as focus on a class that’s gonna start up soon.",14Jun2019,2
