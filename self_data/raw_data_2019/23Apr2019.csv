0,"You know, I love you but mostly, I thank you. Thank you for loving me back. Thank you for pushing me to be better. Thank you for inspiring me. Thank you for making me feel beautiful, for loving the parts of me that I can't myself. Thank you for your hard work. Thank you. Thank you for being a friend. Thank you for thinking of me. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I wish, you could be more understanding with my emotions, as unrealistic I can get, I hurt more than what I should, and the most I can do to change that is preemptively cry by watching old romance comedies or dog rescuing videos. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wish, you'd cry for me. There always seems to be something pent up in you, whether it's the last break up or family issues. I wish, you could hurt for me, so I can help make it hurt less. I want to hold you and tell you it'll be better. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry, that I show you my darkest parts. I'm sorry I can't love myself the way you love me. I'm sorry this is the best I am so far, but I will be better. I'm sorry you have to wait. I'm sorry that sometimes I feel like I don't deserve you. I'm sorry that I hurt so much.",23Apr2019,2

2,"I'm crying right now so I'm sorry if this sound dramatic or emotionally packed...

I applied for my first job last week online. They said they would contact me at a later date. So, yesterday and today I've been getting phone calls from the same number which I suspect to be the place I applied at.

Theres a problem. I have a phobia of picking up the phone to a number I know, let alone answering when it's a stranger calling me. 

I started crying because my dad keeps telling me I need to get a job. I keep having to ask him for money and it's tearing me apart because there is so much I need... I feel guilty taking the money he worked hard for... 

He told me tonight, ""Why dont you just call the number back????"" Like it was no big deal... he doesn't understand how terrifying this situation is for me.... and I'm scared to tell him that it is. 

I'm also stressed because, if it is the place I applied at, what kind of impression am I giving them??? Applying for a job they need filled, then not picking up my phone when they try to call me for it?? I feel like I'm blowing it already... all because my stupid mind is paralyzing me...

I even almost got into a car accident yesterday I just.... I feel like a 5 year old trying to masquerade as an adult now... I dont feel like I should be allowed to try and grow up...",23Apr2019,3
3,"I'm at that point again where I'm giving up on school. It's mid-terms now and I've made up my mind to stop attending. It's such a constant pattern that I'm sick of too. I wish I could just suck it up and go on with it but, I can't. As childish as it sounds, I really can't. I hate the environment so much, being forced into relations with people; group projects, presentations... Feeling like I'm knowingly getting myself into a scam, it doesn't feel great. College can work out for people, but I don't feel like it does for everyone. Maybe it's edgy high school thoughts, maybe I should stop having these but, I feel so frustrated. Having to waste time here. Having to take certain classes to graduate. Even if the professor is an asshole that makes you spend so much money on one project that she just skims and doesn't even give back to you. Being shamed for not traveling to Greek and Rome; it's not being lazy, it's having no money and no time. I don't know what else to say to her but, getting off tangent...

&amp;#x200B;

I don't feel right. I feel like I'm taking a spot for someone that will actually be capable and wants to learn here. I want to develop a skill. And maybe this is a weird stubbornness of mine, but I want to learn on my own. And I much rather work while learning. Rather than waiting for my knowledge the next day. Take my own pace. And the biggest want is, to be working and learning in a different country. I can't stand it here. Being forced to have a car if I want to have any bit of independent life. There's no subways, very slow bus transits, and ubers. And walking is too far to be any convenient, and lately the neighborhood is getting a bit shady with at least one house robbery per month. I was at Korea for 6 months, so I'd say it's a fair ""trial"" at living somewhere and, it was all I wanted. Being able to get around practically whenever and wherever. Whatever the time, it's always safe, at least a lot more than here. Everything practically at walking distance, and cheap fares. Being there for 6 months, I was at a college in a language program learning better Korean. I made friends irl, I had a part time, I had a job, I did so much. I went out almost everyday with friends, and from being a in house loner who only played video games with her precious online friends. It was a lonely, unfruitful lifestyle. I hated not doing anything. But from that, to suddenly having a social life and making money. It felt great. I loved it so much, but I had to go back. Everything I worked for, my relations, my job, just gone. I come back home but, it feels more foreign. It almost just made all my progress into a far dream. As soon as I got back home, I missed Korea. It hurt. I missed people. I missed actually doing something. I can't stand being here. I can't drive. I've tried and tried again but, when I start practicing driving, those nightmares keep happening. I can't do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

What's even harder is that, it's very possible for me to live there. My grandparents have a spare room and that already covers so much of the cost and having a part time is well enough for me, but I won't stop at a part time, I could do other one time jobs like translations, and maybe possibly more if I actually work in my Aunt's company. I could also work on my drawings in the down time, and I could finally meet people again. Once a week or so, is already so much more than I could hope for. But, I can't. It's so close but I can't. How could I tell mom who has been stuck here since she left. Where the only 2 times she went back to Korea was because she thought her father was going to die. Bless that he is alright and healthy but, those were probably the worse few weeks in her life. Other than that, she hasn't been back to Korea for over 30 years. And for me to just go up to her to tell her that I want to live there, and that I'd make it work. Even if she would support her, she'd resent me. She'd fall apart. Even if I'm not the greatest daughter, I was at least there to listen to her complain. Brother and dad won't do it. I don't know if she'll be alright. I've been already so selfish. All she wants is for me to graduate but I can't even do that for her. But I keep, failing. I keep falling back. Because my minds in Korea and I keep making plans in my head to make it work. 

&amp;#x200B;

With the built up mileage, I can go to Korea for 2 months. It's a visit, with probably and possibly some work. Before I leave, I might tell what I've been thinking and feeling to my grandparents and see if they would be okay with it. But, that's not fair to my mom. But I do know that when I have to go back, it'll hurt so much. It doesn't help that my boyfriend is in Korea. I wish they wouldn't take it as me just missing my boyfriend. Of course I miss him but this big decision was in my heart way before I met him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so torn. But I also feel like I should just, work hard and do what I want. At least for now, while I'm not attending classes. I'll be working hard on drawing and maybe, I could make some money too. Just, have something to show for if I ever get to explain to my mom. That I can take care of myself, and that I can work for what I want. And if not, at the very least, make enough money to at least go to Korea once a year, and have left over to have a savings account for mom. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry I'm your daughter but I want to be the best I could be for you. Even if it's not much. But I also want to do what I want. As cheesey as it is, I want what my heart wants. Because not being able to strive for it, is already hurting so much. I'll make so much money that the house rent will be okay without you, and you can enjoy your time in Korea too. But I want to enjoy it with you. I'm sorry mom.",23Apr2019,3

5,"The last 4 years of my life have been intense. My career took me around the world and I had a chance to live in Shanghai and London. Over the last few months I’ve started to slow down and more recently I’m practically useless. I had been working 70 plus hour weeks and worked across all corners of the business.

Unfortunately, I’ve hit a wall in the last month where I can barely think straight and get tired all the time. Since I’ve gained a reputation of being a workhorse my workload, which used to be easy, is out of control. If I take time off I’ll be screwed so I’m contemplating finding a new job and taking some time off. I have pretty bad anxiety so of course this all seems far bigger of a deal through my anxiety tinted glasses.

I have only stayed here 2 nights before this, but I stayed last night and it’s currently 2:30am and I’m having very bad bouts of paranoia. My dog was in my room with me, and he randomly woke me up by angrily growling. My dog doesn’t make any noise whatsoever, unless he feels threatened. The room I’m in is tiny. I feel suffocated in it, I literally cannot breathe. there is one small window that looks into the road, The curtains are closed. I don’t know why he started freaking out, so I put him into a different room with my sister. My phone was close to dying and my charger is at my now ex boyfriends house so I’m currently sat in the living room using my dads charger with the tv on trying to calm down. The front door is in my line of vision and it’s like a big window there’s no curtain for it. when I get very paranoid I start seeing things but I don’t know how I would cope seeing things right now. I’m still pretty shaken up about last night with my ex so I feel like I’m very sensitive. I have a bunch of lights on too because with the lodge dark I feel so much worse.

14,"It was my ex. Things have tough since we broke up. It was a hard break up on us both and initially I was handling it well and he wasn’t. He reached out and poured his heart out to me.

After a few weeks he gave me more space, and then I started to fall apart. I reached out to him because I felt so alone. 

Every time we talk to each other we cause each other pain. He still had hope we can get back together when at the moment I need more time before considering that as an option. We always tried to go no contact for a period of time, but even after being broken up for 2 months we haven’t gone 3 days without contacting each other.

I talked to some people and finally decided to be serious about no contact. Every time I talked to my ex we would eventually talk about our relationship and it was so hurtful and stressful on us both. We closed things off on a good note Sunday night.

Monday he reached out to me about how sad he was, he didn’t want to lose me, he can’t do contact. He called me at a really low point to talk about our relationship again. I told him we can’t do this anymore and have to try being on our own fully. I said I would block him and gave him a date when I would unblock him. We talked a little and both calmed down. We ended on a good note.

Now I’m sitting here on my phone knowing I won’t see his name pop up again. I see his name in my past messages and it stabs my heart. I feel alone again, I feel almost as if I want to reach out again but I can’t because we are no longer together. I don’t know why it ended up like this.",23Apr2019,2

I’m not trying to be rude, and just because I don’t say anything doesn’t mean I don’t like the fact that your their. I never realized that the reason I rarely agree to plans is because I’m scared of the idea of going out to a place I don’t know, with people I may not know to well and how things will end up turning out.

I have trouble relating to humans and why humans do things. Why do we need billions of people on the planet. Why do we give birth to more humans and why care about any other generation of humans other than our own. Why not stop having children and just let humanity fade out of existence. Does it really matter what a future unborn generation will be? Why care about something that doesn't exist yet. Isn't that why women get abortions? Because something that doesn't exist yet doesn't matter?

Why is it good to have many people instead of just a few? Why bother having a society? Having more people only brings conflict. War and starvation. Life is unstainable.

Not sure what to do. I know obviously I need to just snap out of it and work hard to fix myself, but I’m overwhelmed and don’t know where to start.. it seems hopeless and I just want to give up.

Some context:
Since middle school my attendance has been terrible. It’s usually worse in the second semester of the year, and recently I’ve been missing 2-3 days a week. Sometimes I only go once a week. I haven’t done anything productive in so long.. resulting in failing my classes.

On the contrary, I’m very involved in extra-curriculars, such as jazz band &amp; jazz choir. And I’m in an exchange group going to japan this summer :D My family is even planning on hosting a student for a year. 
I do good in music and Japanese, but I’m still failing the rest of my classes..

It’s not like I’m a “problem student” or a rebel. Most people think I’m like an honor student or something, until I tell them I’m failing. I guess I am mature in some ways, but....
augh. My attendance.. why can’t I just snap out of it and go to school? I‘m missing the classes I enjoy, too.. but I still skip.  

At this point I’m not going to get enough credits to graduate. I’ve only gotten half a credit of math, and have been trying to make it up online but keep failing that.. I’m not taking any math class this year, not sure why other than wanting to take more music classes (I take 3 of them during school, then 2 clubs) And at this rate I’ll fail my other classes and not get those credits. I already failed 1st semester English..

I feel like it’s fine even if I can’t graduate at the end of my senior year, I can just get my GED and move on with my life.
I feel like I can just get what I want out of high school, like music. And just ignore everything, and not care about making up those stupid credits. 
Taking music will be more beneficial to my future, right? Since there’s no way I’ll do anything other than something with music.

But is this thinking logical? Is it rational? What if it’s like, “aw, I wasted all that time just to not graduate”..
And what if I want to go to college for music? Well, I think some accept students with GED.

My parents would probably be fine with me not graduating, after little persuasion.

My sister stopped going to school in 8th grade, because of anxiety and terrible panic attacks. She’s 17 now and I guess you’d call her a drop out.. But now we have a puppy in training to be a service and emotional support dog, and she’s an amazing artist and really loves aquariums and taking care of fish and, I think her future will be just fine. I’m proud of her and love her :’D sorry I’m just a mushy little sibling lol.

Anyway.. does that tell you anything about my family &amp; parents? I’m an over-achiever compared to her, but we still have in common our terrible attendance. Mine is just caused by... laziness, depression, and can’t get out of bed ??

Back to graduating. When it comes time, I doubt I’ll want to retake a year.. but at the same time I don’t want to give up a class I actually want for a class I have to make up. I could always try doing it online, but that’ll make me overwhelmed.. 
so right now I still feel like it’s fine if in the end I don’t graduate. I might regret it later.. but.. idk.

Having an ambition I could never quench and an above average intelligence quickly turned to despair when I could not orient myself in the World. I have still never found the career or validation or the career that will magically give me a purpose and dwarf my inner suffering and desires for respectable career aspirations. 

I have now realized it is all BS. Picture this people of Reddit - Imagine you found your path and life's calling which is exemplified by this scenario. Your path was to work 80 hours a week through your 20s, 30s, and 40s to be the chief executive of Blockbuster. Netflix comes along and your company closes and that is the only thing you ever did. Blockbuster crumbled but you still retired at age 60 with all of the money you ever needed. That is what we in our society would call a hypothetical win. I now realize it is all completely pointless. You lost!

You married at 22 years old when you were a kid and settled on your first girlfriend because you thought you were in love. By 28 you realized she was the wrong girl and now you feel like the holy fool. You gave your life to a pointless career that gave you what was thought to be validation and fulfillment but you've wasted your life. 

It would have been infinitely more desirable to have failed in business and that relationship. The 60-year-old wealthy CEO has no idea what they missed out on. Traveling and meeting new people and forming new relationships through adventures would have been worth more to that 60-year-old than all the Gold and Diamonds of 5 planet Earths. The adventures and experiences you made in your 20's brought more cultivation and value that this CEO will never have known possible. Instead, for the pursuit of wealth and status you've lost out on all that is good in life. 

I quit my mundane cubicle job, broke up with my girlfriend and have never been happier in my life. I thank the high heavens that this happened and I did not stick it out for that promotion so that I could buy the new Tesla and give the first girlfriend I had a grandiose wedding. I moved to a cheaper part of the country and found a labor job that I am probably 30 IQ points too high for and the best part is I do not care in the least. I no longer feel like I'm missing out on career advancement. I saved money from this job, lived frugally, and met better people/women and had better adventures/experiences through traveling Vietnam and Thailand than that cubicle/traffic-ridden commute could have ever offered. I vagabonded for 7 months and am a different person and would have never had this chance if I followed societal norms. I cannot even articulate how liberated I am by just not caring about money or a stupid pointless ungratifying career. 

I realize not everyone will think like me and if you found all of your gratifications from your job more power to you. But, was it worth trading your life away? Would Warren Buffet rather be 85 with 50 billion dollars or 25 and penniless?  

I'll end on this. Say you and I are both 65 years old and just retired. We are sitting on a lake with a group of 4 friends. You married when you were just a kid and ended up divorced while I met a girl from Norway I'd have never met if I stuck out the career and first girlfriend. Will this group rather hear of you burning the midnight oil and working 80 hours a week to close that extra deal so you could snag that extra $20,000? Or would they rather hear of my endless stories of traveling Europe, Asia, and South America with all the wisdom and perspectives I've accrued? I no longer care about my career and am glad I quit my ""good finance job."" I will keep working this labor job and traveling and will eventually switch over to a school teacher and never stop traveling and never stop meeting people and NEVER stop making memories. 

Am I insane?",23Apr2019,2

42,"My skin has gotten progressively worse lately. Having averse reactions to all medications. Nothing helps the blackheads. Lately my acne on my back and chest has gotten considerably worse, for reasons I’m failing to find.

My mom had cystic acne and took accutane at 19. She’s always told me my skin isn’t bad enough for accutane. That’s fair, I don’t have cystic acne.

Last Friday I went into the dermatologist for the 3rd time since last January and told the assistant about my concerns. 

I had been using tretinoin cream and was just hoping for a higher concentration, because I read that if your blackheads are getting worse it means you need a higher concentration. My body acne had gotten worse. I’d just had the worst breakout of my life, even while diligently following a derm-suggested routine. I didn’t even mention accutane ever, even in previous appointments, because I knew my skin wasn’t “bad enough” for it.

My dermatologist comes in 5 minutes later and starts talking about accutane right off the bat. Running through the risks and side effects and the procedure because I’m a woman who can become pregnant. Getting the paperwork started as soon as I said “hell yeah I want accutane.”

Weight lifted. I know I have a long road of side effects ahead of me, but it’s so comforting to know that in about 6 months, this shit will be over. I’m so excited and relieved. 

No more experimenting with endless expensive products, all to no avail. No more insane unending dryness due to the harsh products I was having to use before. I’ll be able to wear makeup again and it won’t look disgusting over my peeling skin. The other areas of my skin won’t be oily 30 minutes after putting on makeup. I won’t feel like a disgusting human being anymore, or worry about being perceived as one.",23Apr2019,1
43,"Because I accept this and I have never felt like I am capable enough to walk away and be by myself. I’m very aware the fact I was raised in an abusive household, how likely it is I will have a pattern of being in other abusive relationships after I get away from the first abuser. I know I’m like that. Despite making change to my life and gradually getting better over long periods of time. 

I know my boyfriend doesn’t value me. That he never has, and I could spend an eternity for him to fulfill his promises to me, and he will fail me every time. 
I’m not on my feet financially and I’m still working on getting away from my abuser. I know I’ve put up with things I shouldn’t, because I was trying to get away. I’ve been trying really hard to get better so I can be a person. I don’t really feel like a person sometimes. More like a shell of one. 

Honestly sometimes I wish I’d just die, because I can’t see myself ever being better than this. I don’t know what it’s like to feel like I’m consistently valued. I don’t know what love is. I know I feel it for others. But I know there are people who say they love me, but don’t, because they things they do are the truth. 

He’s cheated on me, refused for years to get help for his porn addiction, let people from his connections stomp all over me, made excuses for it, lied to me, wouldn’t get himself checked for STD’s. I don’t know why I’m still with him. I don’t think I can even say it’s because I love him, anymore. It’s more because I don’t love myself enough. And I feel like I’ll fail at everything. Nothing I do is good. I’m not good enough at just even being a person for me to even exist as others do. 

I got ready to make dinner (mostly for myself because at this point I don’t care what he thinks or wants), o told him to leave me alone while I cooked. And I was actually made for a few minutes. I lost energy to be mad, so I just feel empty now. There was a few moments where I was so mad, I felt like maybe I had the drive to actually get my shit together and get out. I just feel empty now. Like, empty, but still full. Full of just, all this. And I don’t want it. 

I was trying to tell him tonight that him not keeping his own word again, was making me doubt other important and bigger things he’s promised me.  He then held something I haven’t completed, over my head. 

I’m ashamed that I can’t drive yet. I’ve taken the test 3 times, and it costs money to take it after you’ve failed 3 times in a row. The test is only for my learners permit. I haven’t gotten anyone to teach me to drive without it. Before I couldn’t afford retaking it a lot because all my money was being taken from me, when I lived at home with my parents. I’m very ashamed of having nearly passed or last time. Nearly. That I’m 24 and I still don’t have my license. I feel useless and like an idiot. 

I’m going to go to therapy for abuse stuff and ADHD. I’m having nightmares of not being able to control a car I’m driving and then going off cliffs. I think I’m scared of driving or something, my mom used to fake me out and try to make cars hit us when she wanted to give me a scare. Or she’d kick me out fo the car in bad neighborhoods to scare me. I’m afraid to be in a car with someone when I feel like there in a bad mood. 

I’m not proud that I can’t drive.  But I keep studying and getting the courage up again to take the test, again. I’m going to pay to take an adult drivers class so I can have help. I’m getting to therapy because maybe it’s the ADHD that’s making me fall short while test taking. Maybe. 

It’s one of the things I haven’t completed. I feel like I’m a useless leech for it. But it’s not fair to hold that against me, I’m aware of it and I’m trying. He only did it to make me shut up. He knows it’s a sore spot for me. And that I hate myself for it. In response to me trying to be open and hones, and tell him something. Anything to spare him guilt over his own actions. He’s always been like that. 

I wasn’t sure if what I heard was what I actually heard. He did it twice before it hit me, because he said it so much more clearly and quickly as a response to me. The other toe times I’m not even sure which thing about me he was referring to. I told myself he wasn’t being *like that* and I was reading into it too much. Well, I wasn’t. I defended myself and told him he can’t say that just because I’m telling him something he did is hurting me and I have serious concerns for the relationship. If he’s upset with me or concerned, he should talk to me about it. Not save it for when he can use it against me. 


I honestly wish I’d fade away. I know I didn’t get out of the abusive house hold I Bree up in, just to accept being treated like this. Never knowing if he’s secretly looking up girls online. Because that’s exactly the same as me failing the driving test. **Totally**. 

Well this useless sack shit cooked an amazing dinner tonight. This unsuccessful twat taught herself to cook over the last couple years. 


I’m back in college picking up where I left off. I had to drop out due to things going on with my family, years ago. I’m going to pay to have my moped towed here so I can have it fixed and have something I can use for legal transportation. I’m hoping to pass the test this time so I can have my permit. 

I reminded him that he helped his best friend learn to drive without her having her permit. He didn’t extend that to me, and I have had to try learning and taking the test without that help.

Hey guys!

How to play the piano for kids by PianoCourse101 is based on the Bastien Piano Basic Series for children. The Bastien Piano Basic Series consists of four levels. There are the ""Primer Level"", ""Level 1"", ""Level 2"" and ""Level 3"". I will eventually be uploading all of the courses on youtube. The first few lessons of the ""Primer Level"" are free and available on youtube while the rest of the lessons will be available on my website, which will be announced pretty soon. Lesson 1, Lesson 2 and Lesson 3 are paid courses. I believe that PianoCourse101 offers piano lessons that is not only well structured by engaging for children. Utilising a white board with rhythm exercises, explaining terms in a visually presentable manner is one unique method in making learning fun for kids.

50," This is a really weird story from my childhood and It involves allot of speculation and I could be way off I was really young, but here it is 

 I had 5-6 years (12 years ago) and I was out with my parents, my mom is completely deaf and my dad is deaf in one ear, and they are part of a deaf association, we used to go there quite a bit, about once per week or every two weeks.  
  As a kid I never felt endangered there I was there allot, I knew the people and even when I met new people there they were always nice.

 One day, we went there to have dinner and the place was packed, I don't remember if it was a party or a holiday or something like that. I remember sitting at a table and a guy around 40yo came up to me telling me he was a friend of my dad and gave me some candy, at first I wasn't sure if I should accept, but he kept insisting he was a friend of my dad then he said to meet him outside if I wanted more.  
 When I was going outside an actual friend of my dad stopped me and told me I couldn't go outside alone, I told him a friend of my dad was waiting for me out there, but he didn't let me go out and took me to my dad.  
 I told my dad a friend of his was gonna give me candy outside and had given me a piece inside, and my dad got really mad, I hadn't understood that the man wasn't his friend. I kept thinking my dad was only mad because he hadn't seen the guy so he didn't know if he was his friends, but I as a stupid innocent child had believed him.

 Around one year ago I remembered this story while talking with a friend about going to the deaf association when I was a child, and then I realized that the man probably really wasn't my dad's friend and that I was probably gonna get molested if my dad's friend didn't stop me.",23Apr2019,10

Feel free to say ""Duh!"", but the best way to eliminate unwanted chatter in the mind, improve focus and concentration, banish anxiety and nervousness of an origin you can't work out, reduce the disabling effects of feeling overly self-conscious and over-analysis of everything which leads to you limiting yourself, improve the clarity and quality of your thoughts, increase your conviction and confidence in any decisions that you make, reduce the rattling bodily tensions and tightness in the chest which has no obvious psychological reason to be there, improve the quality of spontaneous ideas which just come to you without having to try, increase your willingness to accept and respond in the moment to the chaotic randomness of daily life...etc etc etc...

The best way to achieve all this in one fell swoop, for FREE TOO! - is by getting 8 hours of blissful deep sleep.  I know. Duh!!! 

Whenever I'm fortunate enough to have such a rejuvenating gift bestowed upon me I praise and give thanks to Hypnos as soon as I arise - The God of Sleep. Mate! You da real MVP!!!  

But in addition to my belief that a fictitious Greek deity is responsible for my peaceful slumber, there must be a science, or at least, concrete measures I can take to maximise the chances of sleeping well. 3 things that were different about last night's sleep which I'll be trying again tonight to see if it wasn't just a fluke were:

1. Using a sleeping mask to block out all light. I don't want the sun to wake me ""naturally"" thanks. I'd rather have some more quality Zzzzzzzzz... instead. The actual truth which led to this revelation that everyone apart from me already knows was that I fell asleep with my virtual reality headset on again. This is something I unintentionally do often, and friends who have photographed me in this dystopian state have been compelled to create albums with these images because it looks so weird.

2. Bed is set at a slight decline to utilise gravity. Two notches of wood of around 1/2 inch were placed underneath the legs connected to the headboard. Not noticeable enough to feel like I was kipping on a slope, but enough to encourage bodily fluids to continue on their natural paths and not to remain stagnant as they normally would do on a perfectly horizontal mattress. 

3. Pillow height and shape was fashioned to fit the space in between my shoulder and head perfectly, so that both head, but more importantly, my neck, felt wonderfully cradled when sleeping on my side.

Again, these mundane insights are probably what many people do anyway, but I think there are also a lot of people who just jump into bed and hope for the best, who see sleep as a game of Russian Roulette for their mind and body. Sleep is where your day starts before it starts so it's crucial this period is as high a quality as you can make it. I feel the same way about the importance of comfortable footwear and the use of insoles to correct one's gait, but can't be arsed going into that right now.",23Apr2019,1
53,"My father had a stroke yesterday and he didn’t get to the hospital for several hours because the symptoms were masked by fatigue and lethargy. 

My mom keeps blaming herself for not getting him to the hospital sooner but I don’t think it’s her fault. He went through his full and normal dialysis treatment and none of the techs or nurses sent him to the ER. They thought that he was tired too. 

At this point he’s stayed asleep at the hospital and can only be woken by shaking him and calling him for 5 minutes. Once awake he keeps his eyes closed and will only give one word answers occasionally. Things aren’t looking good. 

My father is literally my only friend I’m not sure how I’ll survive without him. I’m also not sure how my mom is going to survive either. His disability payments cover all their bills and my mom doesn’t have any marketable skills. If he doesn’t survive I won’t be able to support her. I have a mountain of debt because of a lengthy period of stupid decisions on my part. 

I don’t know what to do.",23Apr2019,31
54,"I believe in many cases we all hold onto our beliefs and patterns of thinking too long for our own good. We may still hold an ethic from childhood or a self contrived mentality that may have helped us at one point, but is holding you back in some way in the present. 

I recently realized that I was suffering as a result of this. I was too proud of my previous beliefs about myself, which led me to not accepting my current situation and truly seeing all the good that comes out of it. 
Also, I had a dream which involved me running anxiously through a school to reach my destination. I knew that my surroundings were interesting and that I was safe, but I never let myself relax and smell the roses. 
If we fixate our mentality on one view, we will never be able to fully appreciate the big picture. 

We all need to adapt to new situations in life. It is difficult since we’re goal orientated creatures, but with some practice of mindfulness you’ll be able to take yourself out of the moment and realize what you need at this current state in your life.

56,"Got tricked into attending a for-profit college with a predatory lender before I am even 18, no worries though. Worst case I can declare bankruptcy right? Oh no, a few months before I graduate the law changes and student loans can no longer be discharged without extreme medical circumstances. Oh and don't forget, if you stop paying they take your paychecks directly and add plenty of penalties on top of that.

Alright then I'll just work my way through right? My parents said that if I went to school I would be rich? No... struggling with the cost of living daily. Get a second job, still making 20% under living wage total. I don't go on vacation. I don't buy anything fun. I'm still using a laptop from 2010 that I won in a free raffle. I literally wake up, drive to work (sorry, no public transportation available because the government pulled funding and it's too far to walk or bike.) go home, sleep. I can barely afford nutritious food. Even though I moved to the cheapest place I can find and still have a job.

Things start looking up, sure I wont have my loans payed until 2040+ after already paying over a decade now... but I have a little emergency savings. Nope, can't have that. Medical emergency time.

Drive myself to the hospital because my insurance doesn't cover ambulance. Crawl in. All kinds of infections and shit, need emergency surgery. Literally costs me more than my life savings to pay the co-pay. Try to do what /r/personalfinance says and work the system but they barely budge. I have to call the fucking attorney general because my anesthesiologist was billing me illegally 'oh sorry, billing error' my as you pieces of shit. My friends say I'm a moron for paying at all. I should have just let my credit score tank. They're probably right.

While in the hospital a few days I saw someone tow my $500 beater car from the lot. Too drugged up to handle it. When I'm sober, call all the tow company contracted by the hospital. They say they never took it. Go to police station because my phone wasn't working (bill went past due while I was in the hospital.) They tell me that they have on record it was towed but no log of who towed it, only that it wasn't stolen. They refused to do anything further and get pissed at me for wasting their time.

Go to bank, close my empty savings account so I don't get a fee because you get charged for being poor. Get home, get the mail. Student loan payment going up as the government raised the allowed interest. Well, at least I don't have any other debt so should be happy right?

Be depressed for years, can't afford counseling and psychologist. Read self-help books from the library best I can. Take free courses and try to better myself... but I am years behind professionally and financially for my age at this point.

S.O. is sick as well, hasn't been able to work in years because of the pain but the government wont give her disability without medical documentation. She also can't afford the doctor, so we're both basically dying together. We don't qualify for programs because we make $10 over poverty or whatever.

Spend years researching countries I might be able to move to... to leave the debt and country behind, get medical help, start fresh in a society that supports each other. There are so many restrictions and you know what? I get it. Who the fuck would want the burden of an American 2nd world refugee in their country.

So fuck it, I'm stuck here. I'm going to keep trying to overcome this bullshit I got myself into. Not a goddamn person cares about this shit so whatever. I'm probably stupid but I don't know what else to do at this point other than brute force life. If I live long enough maybe I can have a few years of peace before I die... I hope it's worth it.

57,"I had about three wonderful months during which I thought I finally got rid of it, after years of on and off depression. My psychiatrist told me I was free of it and I believed him. I couldn't even understand, during those times of euphoria, why I have ever thought about taking my own life. They were all gone like never before.

It was really nice. I felt happy and content with life. Then it was just okay, as it should be. I thought it would stay that way.

I felt it approaching again, though. A few days have passed since I can't shake this off and this feeling is too damn well known for me to ignore it. I'm starting to understand my old self again and I gradually stop being able to understand the perspective I had when I was okay. 

It sucks because I'm not sure what I did wrong. Or if there had been any way to avoid it.

I like to think this time I'll be more mature and more accepting of it. That it won't bring as much chaos as it did before. That I won't burden people as much as I was before. That I'll learn to live with it while living my life as well and not letting it take full control of me and my personality. 

That it will be like an old buddy that has to spend time over and makes a mess every time, or a cranky roommate that sometimes goes home for the weekend and gives me some space to feel alright.

Im also very stupid and such a fool a mindless guy.

I always think nodoby loves me and think no one ever will. 
Im not smart im not a genius i just feel dumb and stupid and so foolish, im absent and simple minded, im not interesting or fun like you guys or funny... 

Its like i really want a girl to love me well this shows why i never had a GF and always alone. 

I always ask my self why i dont get much likes and rts like others in twitter or why never a girl chases me, i compare my self to others a lot...

I used to text girls a lot in social media i was like why i dont get attention but inside it was just me trying to get into their pants but i acted nice. 

I have tried to run a lot from the facts but i should face them and not be a loser or disappointment to my parents. 

This year i will fail in school also. I have very bad grades.

My personality is so fucking boring only thing i do is play soccer and video games and watch movies so not much.

62,"My husband and I welcomed our son at the beginning of the year, and due to finances I had to go back to work early instead of taking the full 12 weeks that we had originally planned. 
I work from home, so I thought the transition would be not as painful, because my supervisor told me he understands what it’s like having kids and knows that I’ll be occupied most of the day. 
But since then he’s reprimanded me for not being online AT LEAST 40 hours/week, and for being slower than the people that work out of the office. I keep explaining that my schedule and routine is wack with a child but he just says it’ll straighten out, and has been less than accommodating. 
I feel like my day is prioritizing work, trying to feed the baby and then get him to sleep so I can do a few things, but then I feel like I’m neglecting him in one of his most important stages. 
I feel angry and lost and like a shit mom because I’m getting annoyed at my son for not sleeping during the day so I can get work done. 
All I want is the freedom to pay attention to his needs and grow with him. 

I realize that there are working moms who handle these things well, but honestly that’s just not who I am. 

Am I being selfish or unrealistic?",23Apr2019,1

64,"I am 19 and I have this mist of uncertainty in front of me. For the first time, going to university I feel like I've finally escaped the small protected fishbowl bubble that is my carefully curated middle-upper class childhood. 

I was in the process of finding a part-time job whilst studying full-time and then one night I just thought to myself why is it that I want this job. And the answer was easy. I wanted it so that when I apply for internships and graduate positions, I'd get a job. The work experience, as well as the references with them, are beneficial for me to find a graduate position. And getting a graduate position was what it means to be successful in university. 

And then, I started to question that, is that real success. Probably not. What is success then? Happiness seems to be a common answer, but is the individual who's in the moment of euphoria induced by the hallucinogens successful. Probably not, because that happiness cannot be sustained. Then there must also be a time factor to happiness, or in order words happiness must be sustained. Should I try enlarging my social circle knowing full well that the transient nature of acquaintance is that they are fragile and brittle under pressure? Should I volunteer for somewhere to get a sense of achievement? 

But would getting a decently paying graduate position guarantee happiness. No. But, what is the alternative? I have neither the skills to start my own business nor have the drive to explore the rest of the world that so many of the people my age share? Would I be more happy working in one place, living a stable albeit uneventful life or should I embrace the lives of the urban nomads that we call expats today? Should I work for a not-for-profit like the Against Malaria Foundation or should I try my hand in government? Should I work in the public or private sector? 

In a sense, I in at a crossroads in my life where I have a lot of very important decisions to make and I have to make them on little and often flawed information. Ironically, I am overwhelmed by the weight and the different factors that I have to consider whilst making these decisions and that has caused me to make rather unrational decisions. Such as writing a lengthy internet rant rather than studying for my Microeconomics exam due in 9 hours. 

What should I do?",23Apr2019,3
66,"Waking up. 

It’s the first thing you do when you start your day.

Most of us are required (usually due to the standardized 9-5 M-F) to wake up bright and early.Everything is just fine before the sun starts climbing through that one sliver of curtain that for some reason you’ve never fixed despite waking up blinded every morning. 
But oh wait, you should’ve been up before sunrise! 
All your thoughts are going a million miles an hour and your eyes just can’t seem to focus despite your body moving on autopilot. of course you didn’t fill your tank up the night before. You showered yesterday right? That’ll do. Throw a granola bar in your bag. Solid. You check the time on your phone and realize it’s at 17% Gotta get out the door, gotta speed things alon- FUCK you forgot.. what did you forget? You already started the car but you decide to run inside quick because you might need whatever it is you can’t remember. 
..Did you really lock the door? (Well yea.. why wouldn’t you) but the keys are in the car GOD DAMMIT. You decide it wasn’t that important anyways because if it was you wouldn’t forget it. And your running late. And Your coffees cold because-just kidding you don’t take the time to make coffee at home because you’re always in a rush. You know you need that coffee before you get stuck in traffic. You stop, and everyone else needs their Joe too. You wait. You wait. You wait. You thank the barista, not too enthusiasticlly because you see each other every morning, but because you see her every morning. You think about tipping her next time you have cash on you (you never carry cash). You just want to get to work to get it over with but god dammit you so not want to fucking go to work. Is it too late to call in sick? Ugh no, then you’d have to waste your time getting a doctors note and you can’t afford an urgent care visit anyways. Maybe a family emergency? No, you live too far away from them for that to make sense, your bosses know enough to know that’s not right. You try to find a radio station after realizing you’ve been listening to that annoying morning talk show for a half hour now. But they’re all talk shows and commercials and maybe a new pop song you literally gave up on trying to figure out who sings it. You have no idea who half these people are anymore. The sun interupts your inner monologue yet again, but this time signaling the end of your morning commute. The last turn into your lot. The sun blares right into your face every morning and you can never tell who’s their before you. Maybe it’s not too late to turn around if Boss isn’t in yet. You Turn the car off and sit in silence for one second too long. You embrace the fact this is your life and you lock the car and head inside. You squish into the cement. You’re wearing slippers. You forgot your shoes.

The Rest of the Day Was pretty much just sleep. No Cake, no Party, just me and my bed. I dont want to work though. I have nothing to work for if you get what i mean. I have no hobbies, friends, or interest in anything but sleeping.

I was failing every class at the time, and I had failed most of the classes the year prior.

71,"I met this guy when I was sixteen. I went to a party with his friends, I got wasted, and two of them brought me to a different house and had sex with me. I bled I felt baffled. The next day they told all their friends they were 18 and 19. I was already getting bullied and had slut rumors spread about me, so they thought I wanted it. They called me gross.




I just lost all confidence at that point I felt like damaged goods. I still hooked up with one of them after that because I felt like no one would want me after that. John would hook up with me when he was drunk but ignore me during the day. 



He left for the military but still kept in contact with me. I would send him pics over two years and see me when he was home. He cheated on one of his girlfriends with me.  I didn't know because the one social media I had he posted no photos but on every other platform he did. He would have sex with me then ignore me for a month. He implied I'm attractive enough to fuck but not be seen with




I graduated I turned 18 he was 20 that is the last time I saw him. I left to volunteer outside the country for two months. My phone broke while I was there while I was gone he blew up my phone sending me dozens and dozens of messages. He also made tweets like ”if you have to think if I care about you I probably don't fuck everyone.”


When I got back, I talked to him some. Then he got weird and was like ”do you tell anyone I talk to you. I don't want to ruin my reputation.” I felt like a dirty secret and gross. I kept asking why he would say that he said he had a girlfriend. I said if you have a girlfriend, then you shouldn't be talking to me and focus on her because she's probably a nice pretty girl. He said he was joking and send nudes. 


A couple of weeks later I ask why we haven't talked. He says he has a girlfriend and doesn't want to see me. I ask why he lied to me, why I'm not good enough. John called me annoying and said ”thats just who he is.” that he wants me got sex nothing less nothing more.


That girl ended up cheating on him and him, and he started texting me again, but I never saw him in person after that. It's been almost four years. I moved to LA to finally be happy.  I started working in production on TV and commercials. I met a lot of nice people, no one has been mean to me since I moved here and guys are always so lovely.

I feel so ugly by the way he treats me. Two years ago he texted me after having a girlfriend for eight months. At first, I didn't know when he told me that I said I don't feel comfortable talking to you with a girlfriend. He sent me dozens of texts saying he missed me and sending old pics he had of me from three years ago. He asked,” if I was single would we be cool again.”


I kept ignoring him, and a couple of weeks later he got a new girlfriend. Posted lots of pics of her saying she's gorgeous. He went on deployment we stopped talking. After his deployment, he got discharged and moved to the east coast with his girlfriend. Before he left, he tried to see me and tried face timing me like 60 times. Thank God I was in a different state.


Now he's been messaging me like crazy saying he misses me and that I'm beautiful. I just blew up at him after six years of this I couldn't take it anymore. I called him a rapist, a douchebag, self-centered, a cheating loser, a sociopath, a liar, and a coward.

He just kept saying ”why are you mean to me.” and ”if you're going to put me down stop messaging me.” he also tweeted stuff like ”if you can’t respect me. Then at least have the decency to leave me alone. be your own problem.” after I blew up at him the first time he tried apologizing for a couple of months later, but I just started saying the same stuff to him.


I feel like shit I feel like this is my fault why would anyone treat me like this? Was I too mean to him? Did he treat me this way because of how I look?

Life is prosaic  
until it is poetic  
Profane  
until profound  
Pedestrian  
until Pegasus-equestrian.

We spend days lamenting  
how we could've been elsewhere  
how we could've done something  
worthwhile  
Then we look in the eyes of someone dying  
and decide to linger a while.

We let actors  
show-and-tell us how to be  
and give up all we could be  
for a brief spark  
and give up our light  
to the dark.

We let athletes  
dazzle our eyes  
with moves that surprise  
and give up our moves  
and give up our lives.  
We can't possibly move like that  
so why try?

Perhaps, on the other side  
We'll know.  
We shouldn't have waited in line

We were really the Show.",23Apr2019,31

I'm 17. About to turn 18 on May 3rd. I have issues. With anxiety. And I've been diagnosed with ADHD. I'm taking meds for it. Adderall. I don't really notice a difference. I'm also taking Flouxetine for depression and Mirtazapine for sleep. I'm currently in one of the classes I'm failing. I don't do anything for the class. I guess I try, but I hardly turn in anything for it. If something is wrong, I just let it stay that way. And act like I don't care. I don't ask for help. Having troubles with motivation.

76,"It's utterly incomprehensible as to how someone could willingly want to harm another person. What do they derive from it? Pleasure? Acceptance? Self-improvement? Prejudice should not be akin to ruthless, unimaginable murder.

Psychosis is not a punch-line. Psychosis is real. It prevails over guilt, remorse, and empathy. It's parasitic. It's controlling. It's what takes over sanity, and dictates such sadistic behaviors.

I am scared. I am worried about everyone else. I do not want to live with this fear. No one deserves to go through this, and my heart aches for everyone who has been affected by these attacks. To those who are gone, to those who are injured, to those who are frightened... I am sorry.

Watching the news every 10 minutes is gut-wrenching. I now instinctively try to turn away whenever I see the horrifying images on the screen. I keep asking my mum how many of the casualties were children, but I'm honestly in fear of knowing the truth because whatever the answer will be, will break me. Innocent lives. Pure blood. 

After 10 years of relative peace, it's unfair to be propelled into a new state of insecurity, regardless of its permanency. It's unfair for the generations before us to live through such exhaustion, turmoil and unpredictability all over again, just like they did for 30 years. As our generations morph into adulthood, we now understand how our parents felt, why they would hug us an extra few minutes whenever we left every morning for school, we would answer their every phone call, why they would often keep us home. 

I pray for our armed forces. Their courage is what's keeping us afloat. I pray for our authorities to act firmly and decisively, and without bias. 

I pray for those who will be condemned, for those who might be retaliated against. I'm sorry for this divide. 

Regardless of how long this will permeate, I want you to remain hopeful. Support each other. Unite. Love, unconditionally. Empathize. Do whatever you can. It's how an angel gets its wings. It's the only way we can thrive. 

For anyone who needs reassurance, give a listen to ""Don't dream it's over"" by Crowded House, or even John Lennon's ""Imagine"". The lyrics speak volumes. 

Keep the faith. And love.

Then I got my birthday gift that year and it was a beautiful black kitten. I was so happy for him and I couldn't believe it. He was my best friend. 

We grew up together and he had such a great personality. At first he was shy but loved to play with dangling toys and if I patted my hand on the floor. He watched me paint pictures of him and hopped up on the piano with my dad. Everyone spoiled and adored him. He had a special connection with everyone. My brother loved him because they were so similar. Grouchy on the surface but very good and kind on the inside. My older brother loved him too and cuddled him. My mom loved to spoil him. My dad and him became best friends too as they got older. They'd watch movies together, play music together, and sit on the porch together like two old friends. He was my baby. Everyone knew I loved him so much and I cuddled and kissed and pet and spoiled him. My friends all loved him. 

When my brother who picked him out passed away, he was there for us. He is such a good cat. 

I went to college far away and he got sick recently. He has oral cancer. I flew down a thousand miles to see him. He is still so strong for what he has to go through. My brother carries him outside. He loves the outside. He showed him places he has never seen before and let him look around and experience it. He only likes to stay in the bathroom. I stayed with him the whole night I flew down. He calls for us when he is alone and I cannot let him feel alone so I stayed with him, petting him for hours. I am so heartbroken right now. He deserves the actual world. If I could do anything for him to magically be healthy again I would. It hurts so much to see him like this and we are putting him down tomorrow. I couldn't do the phone call and started sobbing halfway. I just feel so horrible because I do not want him to die at all but the suffering is so much that he should be in a better place. I just am so upset he has to suffer another day. I know it'll be so hard to say goodbye but he will be in heaven. I'm not even religious but I know my baby boy and my brother will be reunited soon. And my brother will be happy to see him and take care of him again.

# Happiness

I am vulnerable to addiction. I feel like I'm more vulnerable to addiction than others, but maybe I'm just average, I don't know.

At any rate, the internet is a dangerously tempting place to me. There was a period in my life of at least a year where I spent most of my free time watching Hearthstone videos on YT, even though I've never even played that game. Thinking back to that time feels almost unreal.

I've learned a lot since then. One important thing I've realised is this:

* Pleasure can be achieved through happiness, but not the other way around

This may seem a bit weird if you think of both 'pleasure' and 'happiness' as 'feeling good', pleasure in a more short-term sense and happiness in a more long-term sense. If you see it that way, it's easy to think that if you feel good all the time (pleasure), you should feel good in general, too (happiness). Most people implicitly have this assumption.

What I've come to see ever more clearly, however, is that pleasure and happiness are almost entirely different things. They're two very different kinds of feeling good. How else can it be that in modern society, we have all kinds of things that make us feel good in the pleasure kind of way, yet are still so unhappy (all on average, of course)? In fact, seeking  pleasure can be bad for your happiness: by trying to 'fill the void' in doing things that feel good, what you're actually doing is neglecting the void, causing it to grow ever larger.

The (sometimes implicit) belief that you can achieve happiness through pleasure is a delusion.

One other thing I've come to realise is this:

* Other people are crucial

What I now know about 'the Hearthstone days' is that I wasn't doing well at all. At the time, if you'd asked me how I was doing, I would have said I was fine, and believed it even. The bullying was over, the bullies were gone from my life; more importantly, I'd learned to stand up for myself, I was strong now.

Because I was ignoring them, my wounds couldn't heal.

The bullies. In hindsight, they were just some dumb pricks. It seems almost comical that I ever gave a shite about their opinion of me. And what an impact they had on me! For years - years! - I fled into my addictions, separated myself from my classmates, made very few friends and pretended I was doing fine.

But it's not that I was a fool to care so much about what they thought of me. It's simply the way humans work: we want to feel accepted, appreciated, we want to feel seen and loved. This longing for acceptance even extends to people with zero significance to us. That's how they can hurt us.

I can't imagine what it is like to be neglected, rejected, let alone abused by your parents or other family members, or what it's like to be betrayed by a close friend, or by a lover. Considering how much I was impacted by those bullies, the impact of something going wrong in one of your most important relationships must be overwhelming.

Over the years, most people learn to care less and less about what other people think of them. Really, that is kind of sad. Toughening up is something that shouldn't be necessary.

Autonomy in the sense of 'making your own decisions' is a very good thing to strive for. But the ideal of autonomy as 'not needing anyone else' is a delusion. Everybody needs at least some meaningful relationships with other people in their life. Those who think or pretend they don't are often exactly those who need them most.

I say that because I might have never started recovering from my psychological wounds if it hadn't been for other people. I made some friends, I gradually started to feel more accepted at school, I improved my bond with my parents. That's how I regained some self-confidence and, over time, started seeing how hurt I was.

If you think about it, it's almost painfully obvious: if you're feeling miserable, you should surround yourself with people who accept you. But when you're hurt, this isn't obvious: after all, it's other people who hurt you, so it's other people you should avoid. Sometimes you need other people to show you the way.

So, other people are crucial. Understanding what impact people had on you can help you to see your pain for what it is. And letting people come close to you can help you deal with that pain and, in the end, solve it.

# Cleaning up (and gaming content)

Lately, I've been doing what I like to call 'cleaning up my life'. I'm going through my YT subscriptions and unsubscribing from a bunch of channels. I'm de-installing games. I'm using habit trackers to try and get my screen addiction, sugar addiction and porn addiction under control. It's a bumpy road, but I'm improving.

Basically, I'm trying to do less of the things that give me pleasure.

I've noticed that as I'm doing this, I'm beginning to see more and more things as shallow. Those Hearthstone videos I used to watch? I can't watch them anymore. I just get bored. Whenever I see one in my recommendations, I can't help but think, ""Why the heck would you want to make those as a career?"" I mean, I get it, making a job out of your hobby is a dream come true. I wanted to be a gaming youtuber too, back then. But now, I wouldn't do it if I could. It would feel like I wasn't actually contributing anything to anyone's life.

I mean, sure, you're providing some entertainment, some fun. And maybe, sometimes, people just need some fun. Sometimes people just want to relax and that's fine. And maybe you could spread a positive message in your content. And maybe, if there hadn't been gaming videos to watch, I would have gone to something far worse for my distraction.

So I'm definitely not saying that being a gaming youtuber is evil or anything like that. All I'm saying is, I can't see myself doing that for a living. And maybe, just maybe, some youtubers and streamers should take a step back and ask: ""Why the heck are so many people spending so much time on watching me play a video game?"" And maybe some could, if financially viable, switch from a one-or-more-videos-a-day release schedule to better (and less likely to be addictive to some people) content less often.

Anyway, I also went through my games and asked myself if I was playing them because I enjoyed the gameplay or if I was just playing them because I was hooked. Quite a few didn't withstand that test.

With my media consumption I now try to always ask myself: will reading/watching this give me any new insight or useful knowledge or broaden my worldview? Just interesting isn't enough anymore. I try to no longer just consume everything that comes out, and when I do consume a piece of media, I try to do it with intent. Like, actually paying attention and being critical.

I'm bored more. I feel sad more. But you know what? That's good. Really good, actually. Gradually, I'm starting to do more things that will, in the end, give me a happier life. I'm making more intent choices. I'm choosing to make time for exercise, for family and friends, for reading books, for thinking, for writing.

# Reddit

Now on to Reddit. I started redditing about a month ago. I actually have hope that Reddit can have a positive influence on my life. I can use it like any other medium: to learn, to provoke thought. I can also use it to give advice or be of help to people, which seems to be one of those things that, while feeling good in the moment, can be good for well-being, too. And, of course, I can use it to do things like this. Writing about what's on my mind seems like a healthy thing to do, once in a while.

There are dangers, though. Reddit is definitely a place I could get stuck in if I don't set some boundaries for myself. I've identified two potential addictions:

* Subreddits that keep you scrolling

I don't feel particularly strongly about Reddit's redesign. On the one hand, I like it a lot more aesthetically. On the other hand, it seems to be organised a lot more like other social media. And what most social media are designed to do is to keep you scrolling. In fact, this goes as far as not including too many interesting things in your feed, so browsing it becomes more like gambling and thus more addictive (try searching the web for: Nir Eyal nucleus accumbens variability).

I think, for people who want to live a life freed from pleasure, most of this website is irredeemable shite. A ton of subreddits consist of only posts that you look at for a second and go ""aww..."" or ""haha!"" or ""wow!"" ""oh ma gawd dats soo truuue!"" and then go on to the next one.

They're subreddits that keep you scrolling. All they do is give you short bursts of pleasure that leave you craving for more.

To control this danger, I've made a mental ban list. When I notice that posts of a certain subreddit keep me scrolling, it goes on that mental ban list. I unsubscribe from it, never to return. And I have gained an extra data point that can help me decide what subreddits I subscribe to in the future. And this really is regardless of how good I think the content is. If it is addictive to me, it has to go.

* Karma craving

Another danger is karma. People upvoting your comments can feel really good. It feels like acceptance and appreciation, and as I've said under ""Other people are crucial"", those are two things that we all deeply long for. And maybe, you're thinking: ""But wait a second, karma IS acceptance, karma IS appreciation, or a unit for it at least!"" And there is some truth in that. Think about it, though: are people who upvote your comment or post really showing appreciation for you? Or are they just showing appreciation for what you say?

The dangerous thing about karma is that it can make your longing for acceptance lead to you being someone else in your comments and posts. It can make it so on Reddit, you're always trying to be the funniest, wittiest version of yourself, instead of just being yourself.

In general, I don't like the idea of trying to describe feelings with numbers. In the case of Reddit karma, it can lead to feelings of jealousy when you see someone with a number much bigger than yours. Or it leads to feelings of anxiety: ""What if people don't like it? What if they downvote me a lot and then my karma becomes low and everybody hates me...""

I'll try not to care about karma. I'll try to pay attention to my thoughts and when I notice that I'm thinking about karma when writing something, I'll tell myself to relax, and that they're just fake internet points.

Now, I don't know you and I don't know how you use Reddit. Maybe you're seeking the same things as I named under ""Reddit"". Maybe you use it to catch up on world news every so often. Maybe you use it to watch some cat videos during your break. Maybe you use it to stay up to date with all the dumb or evil things your opposing political party is doing.

But I'm sick of life. I'm not trying to sound edgy or attention seeking - I try not to be. I don't know if I'm depressed because I feel happy sometimes but other times I feel horrible. Im not suicidal. 
I'm just sick of everything -
Of being bullied by my younger brother (12) and not wanting to fight back and harm him.
Of having my parents not really care about me - my room hasn't even had wallpaper for two years, but we're not poor or anything.
Of having constant headaches and migraines and sickness and having to put up with it, and having no real sympathy from anyone. 
I have friends but I'm not good at making them and always seem to lose them to luck or my own stupidity.
I'm in top class but I really don't deserve it.
I don't want to tell anyone but I've seen alot of people on relationship advice and those subs get good help and I just want something.

this past summer i started having panic attacks and crazy health anxiety. i had a reality check in september and decided to go to counseling and start taking meds. fall semester was great i had no troubles in school and did normally well!
until this semester started. i went to classes the first 2 weeks of spring semester and after that i totally just did not go for an entire month.

my grades are really suffering from it. i have been in touch with all of my professors but i don’t even know what to tell them? “hey sorry i suddenly have no motivation and i’m not sure what’s going on?” 
i’ve been really trying little by little to pull back and get my grades up but it’s so fucking hard to get out of bed or just do my work. it’s fucking exhausting all of a sudden for some reason. i have NEVER been like this before and am just curious what the fuck is going on.
i used to be able to wake up at 6 AM do my make up get dressed and be out the door. now i’m lucky if i wake up 5 minutes before an event starts. 

i just recently went to the doctor and switched meds because i think they are the problem but not sure because i did fine fall semester? it’s just getting so exhausting to take care of myself and go to school every single day and go to work every single weekend.  i feel like i need a long long break. am i just crashing or something?",23Apr2019,2

89,"I went to a movie alone the other night and when the employee checked my phone he said, “enjoy the movie.”

I said “you too,"" and wanted to die. I said after, “I didn’t mean you too,” like I was trying to save myself but I was only making it worse.

He said, “It’s alright, happens all the time,” which was really nice, but I still felt embarrassed. He said, “I actually think it’s cute.” He was nice about it at least, but damn I’m gonna be thinking about that moment for a long time.

After the movie I went to the bathroom and saw him again. I tried to avoid eye contact with him because I was thinking about me saying “you too” so much that I barely paid attention to the movie. But he still talked to me despite me not looking at him. He said, “Hey, I know you're probably still embarrassed about saying ‘you too’ to me. And you know what? You should be humiliated, because you exposed yourself to a complete stranger that you are nothing. You are nothing but a no good cum rag.”

He walked into one of the bathroom stalls and I followed him. He laid his hand on my back and bent me over. His fingers slid into my belt loop and pulled my pants to my ankles. “You little whore, you’re just my toy and you’re only here to satisfy me.” I said, “you too.” I didn’t see him pull his cock out of his pants but I felt him press the tip into me. He fucked me, in and out, as his chest smashed against my back. We both came and he pulled his cock out of my cum filled ass and he kissed me on the forehead. Sooooo embarrassing.",23Apr2019,0
90,"I had a good childhood overall I think and I know it could have been way worse than that but let me explain why lately the mentality that followed me all the way from my childhood is starting to bother me.

My sister is bipolar, which means lots of problems. When she was little she couldn't control her anger and anything could make her fucking mad at any time. Right after getting her anger out she would become really sad to the point of being suicidal, for all I know she attempted suicide twice but I saw her trying only once when I was 7. If to that you add that my parents were divorcing at that same time and definitely not on good terms, I thought that there were enough problems already and so I would keep all my problems to myself.

This meant that I dealt with the divorce, being bullied for the sole reason of being my sister's brother and a awful teacher that knew my situation and exploited it to use me as a scapegoat for every problem there was in the classroom, all on my own. I always thought ""People have it worse, just man the fuck up and don't cry about it."" and so I did, never once told anyone about anything, never asked for help because helping me would have been a waste of someone's time when there's someone out there that has it much worse than me.

And honestly I don't mind that because in the end I came out fine. However in the last year or so it started to contaminate the way I see life in general and it's here that I draw the line, now it's not only about ""people have it worse"" now it's also about ""a lot of people are better than you"" and now I can't even enjoy my accomplishments for more than 5 minutes because afterwards they lose all of their value. Fuck that I just wanna enjoy the things i do for fuck sake. 

And it's starting to bother me cause now everything is so whatever, if you know what I mean. And yeah that's that. If you read all of this, thank you for your time, and I hope you'll have a great day, if you skipped here hoping for a TL;DR, sorry but I suck at summing up stuff in a few sentences.",23Apr2019,1
91,"I think my daughter and the dog glitched the other day. I will try to set this up the best I can but I’m not a very good story teller. It has been something that’s affected me since it happened and it freaked me out so bad I actually started to not feel well at all afterwards. Every Thursday afternoon, my daughter and I go to visit my mom before my daughter’s art class. We like to sit in her backyard on a concrete slab that she’s made into a patio with chairs, table, etc. This makeshift patio is located on the side of her house so when we are sitting there we’re able to see a large portion of both the front yard and the back yard. My daughter asks my mom if she can put a leash on the dog, a large Doberman, and just walk him around the house and yard to give her something to do while my mom and I visit. My daughter has done this countless times and always starts from the edge of the front of the house where I can see her all the way around looping back from the back of the house and again into my sight. Because of the size of my mom’s house, the full loop from the  front to the back of house takes at LEAST a solid minute, MAYBE 30 seconds (and that’s pushing it) if both my daughter and the dog were running at full speed. I watch my daughter begin around the front of the house and I’m talking to my mom at the same time. I was in the same fucking sentence and when right as soon as she goes out of sight in the front, she and the dog are instantly (and I mean, you snap and there they were) coming from around the back. If it had just been me witnessing it I would have felt like something was wrong with me (seizure, etc). But my mom noticed the “glitch” too. I was really startled and asked how in the world they did that. My daughter seemed like she had no idea what I meant and I told her there was no way they could have gotten around the house so quickly. I asked her if she had run around there or walked around there and she told me she and the dog walked. I KNEW asking her that even if she had ran as fast as she could there’s NO WAY she would have been able to reach the back yard in a literal split second. I’m talking about she was in the front yard and then you say the next word in your sentence and she is coming around the back. It. Is. Impossible. My mom is someone who doesn’t exaggerate and doesn’t think much about these types of weird occurrences but she was wide-eyed and said “Well huh, how about that? How creepy” I started to freak myself out over it because I kept asking my daughter to walk and run to try and replicate what we had just seen but every time she did it took the normal amount of time it should have taken.

97,"I witnessed the back end of a car accident today. Pretty shocking, in that it almost certainly gives you some level of perspective. 

What stuck me though was that within seconds, people were around wanting to help, make sure people were okay, on their phones to the emergency services and offering calming words to those who were involved. 

It just struck me that in that moment, complete strangers came together. Those in the emergency services arrived on scene and just went into action - yes, I know that's what they train for, but it's amazing to see. 

As far as I know, the people involved were okay, perhaps some injuries which I hope were not critical or fatal. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that, in a world which seems so messed up and so cruel at the minute, it's amazing how strangers can come together with acts of compassion and kindness when it really is required.  And that, in itself, brings a tear of happiness to my eye.

I know she's been hooking up with other guys (she's even slightly bragged about it on a couple occasions), and she has an idea that I have hooked up with other women. Despite me being very clear throughout this relationship that we will never be together, she is still madly in love with me and hopes that I change my mind. I guess to a point I have somewhat led her on, but whenever we talk seriously about our feelings I remind her that she and I are not a match. I love her, but I don't want to be with her. She knows this.

Truth be told, I am just not into her anymore; she weighs me down more than she brings me up, on a daily basis (she calls 8+ times a day, and when I tell her I'm busy or have to cut the conversation short, she gets sad and wants me to make her feel better). It's only getting worse.

&amp;#x200B;

During our relationship I had some financial issues and she offered to help me out, I accepted and told her I'd pay her back, of course. I can start paying her back in 2 months, but can only afford to give her \~$1200/month. Obviously I don't want to wait a whole year to pay her back while I fake being in the relationship, but I also feel like I will ruin her emotionally and she will feel blind-sighted if I were to break up with her in the coming weeks. It also doesn't help that I most recently borrowed from her 3 weeks ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do I break up with someone whom I owe $10k, who is madly in love with me, and will definitely feel blind-sighted when I tell her I don't want a relationship anymore?

   Everyday I seem to get more and more fed up with their behaviour. I used to be able to ignore it, but now it has begun affecting my learning. I would like to go a day without my classes having to stop every ten minutes because someone is talking or snapchatting on their phone for the 15th time.

   I used to despise the term ""teacher's pet"" but now that I'm probably classified as one by most of my classmates considering how often I take the teacher's side in debates and such, I realize that the teacher's pets are probably some of the most sane people out there.

   It's not just me who sees this. To quote the words of one of my teachers ""...they (my generation) see themselves as the center of the universe..."" and ""...they lack the ability to see things from a perspective other than their own...""

So basically I'm about to go to my dream school for a BFA in acting and one thing that caused me a few issues this year was people letting me know in one of my theatre groups I tend to brag a bit without noticing. It wasn't an issue earlier in the year but as I got very busy and caught up with doing so many shows/school work/ work I stopped thinking about it and unconsciously just found that  I had a tendency to in conversation not think about who I was around and talk about the things I got going on which came across to certain people as bragging/ being egotistical (roles I got, my job, college acceptances I could go into it but that's kinda the issue). I think it has a lot to do with my passion, I'm very very passionate about theatre and I just get so excited and want to share with others, but I unconsciously just tell a lot of people and it just doesn't always come across right. Luckily I've been more careful recently in my friend group but it was a major reason I had to leave my school's theatre department, as I tended to boast and people disliked me and started bullying me and leaving me out of things making it a very toxic environment. I'm in the clear with my friends now and I've talked to them and told them I'm working on it and I never had ill-intentions so I feel pretty good there.

However as I'm going to college in the fall, my BFA class is only 16 people and I'm in a GC with them and everyone seems so cool and passionate and I'm so so so so excited to meet them and train but I'm a little worried I will forget as I get so so busy in a conservatory and start bragging/being egotistical and people will dislike me for my years there. So basically I'm looking for any and all tips on how to be more socially conscious of boasting and acting ego-filled sometimes and to see if that's something anyone else has struggled with and if anyone has any advice on how to control it?!

For a long time, I had been rather depressed. After a shitty childhood and Middle School, I didn’t want do deal with people anymore. At Freshman year people aways tried to be nice to me and stuff, I just wanted them to fuck off. I remember this girl tried to approach me. She’s rather blunt and told me I seemed the nicest out of the new faces, and I basically told her to fuck off. Today she’s great friends with a lot of people, but not me. This other guy tried to be really nice to me as well throughout High School, despite my early attempts at pushing him away.

A bit under a year ago, things started going downhill. Me and my childhood friends - The only ones I had, broke up. They just needed to move on with life, you know? Move away, focus on studies, on sports, etc. They grew up, but I didn’t. To fill the void I joined internet forums. It was all cool and stuff, made good friends there. They were good people (Just a bit reclusive, but not Incels or Alt Rights or any kind of scum), but I was depending on them on a daily basis. I just became numb - Did nothing but discuss about power levels of fictional characters all day. My grades went downhill and became worse than my social life.

On March, I reached rock bottom. Went to a Senior party. I tried to flirt with that nice girl I talked about before, but she rejected me. I got so mad I tried to beat her boyfriend, but the other guys stopped the fight before it got nasty. I started crying, and although Mr nice guy that I also mentioned earlier tried to comfort me, I just went home for the best. After trashing my room, I went to the roof to kill myself. But then I just couldn’t. I was overwhelmed with nostalgia… How I’d always watch the sun rise with my old friends in there. I just sobbed until the sun rised and then went home. For the rest of the month, I’d do nothing but cry and sleep in my room. But one day, I had enough. The girl’s boyfriend made a joke about me, that albeit innocent was my last straw. That night had the blade in hands, over my pulse. But then, like a voice of reason popped up on the back of my head. “Why not open up with someone?”. Then I decided: I would talk to someone until the end of the week, otherwise I’d indeed do it.

The next day, I wrote a small letter about how I had been feeling. Handed it to the girl sitting next to me, who had been talking to me for a couple weeks or so. I can still remember the look in her eyes as she read it and then looked at me. She just hugged me. I told her everything about how my life was shit and how I felt, and she told me how just recently her family had been ruined by family members killing themselves. She didn’t have much to say, what I understand - It’s hard to even know what to do when someone randomly says they’re depressed. I kinda just needed a hug and someone to hear me.

Ironically, mr nice guy and the nice girl saw me crying too. The girl just gave me the biggest hug - and I swear to God, I had never felt so safe with a hug. Nice guy heard me and also talked to me, saying how I could always count with him, how I wasn’t an alien or anything for feeling like that, and then told me I should talk with someone very charismatic, who could always make people better and really cared for me: Nice girl’s boyfriend. Yes, the one who almost made me kill myself twice. But tbf first time I was picking on him and second time I was overreacting, however.

Anyways, we just talked over lunch time. I didn’t touch on my depression, we only hung out like a couple of pals and talked about stuff. After that, the girl (The one who saw my letter) told me she talked to the school conselour about my condition and that I should talk to her. I was pissed at the first, but I just accepted I had to seek professional help. She took my hand and sat next to me the whole time when I opened up completely and heard the conselour’s advices.

From that point onwards, I’ve been on the top of the world. I’m seeing a therapist, as per letter girl and nice guy’s recomendations. I’ve talked more and more with people, making some great friends. Sometimes I still feel awfully depressed and lonely, specially when I remember I wasted my High School years and opportunities, but always having my friends there to give me a hug and talk, or even just knowing they’ll be there, always warms my heart.

Thank you for reading my rambling confession. I wanted this to be a more lighthearted confession about how happy I am, but as I always say: Happiness and love can’t be reduced into words. They’re meant to be felt with all your heart.",23Apr2019,1

120,"I have been living with diagnosed depression and anxiety for about 3 years now, but I'm sure I dealt with it for far longer due to childhood traumas/etc. I struggle with the pretty ""standard"" waves of depression. Motivation comes and goes, I make all sorts of excuses for not doing things.

One of the main issues that hasn't helped much is I am in the Air Force and have been stuck at the same base for 5 years doing a job that I didn't want in the first place (thanks, recruiter). At this point, I am the only one of my previous group of friends/colleagues that's still here. Everyone else PCS'd or got out. So lack of friends, mix that with the area being TERRIBLE (random town in Georgia).

Anyway; Last summer I applied to switch jobs and kept getting the runaround. Until FINALLY this past February I got word that I'll be leaving this place, and switching to the job I had wanted in the first place.  I'm ready to say goodbye. I'm ready for better things.

I have about two months until I leave Georgia for a state I like WAY more to start training for my new job. In addition, I'll be living close to friends I've known since high school. I'm so excited! BEYOND anything I have felt in so long.

But, I seem to be stuck in this weird place.  I know better things are coming soon, the light at the end of the tunnel is getting brighter day by day. I want to feel happy and motivated and do productive things on my weekend. I should have energy now right? Nope. I have spent all of my weekends sleeping, only to wake up around 8pm, wander out for some sort of food and then binge watch whatever feels right.

I want to paint my house and make little adjustments before I go because I'll be renting it out. But I have NO energy for anything, especially not manual labor. I feel like I'm just gonna be stuck for 2 months, and then the day I am actually allowed to leave this place maybe it'll actually occur to me?? I don't know.",23Apr2019,1
121,"My dad lived with us until I was around 13. So he was there, but he wasn’t. He was a drunk and emotionally abusive. I have some memories with him. Some of them were great, but they were few. 

He taught me how to play football and baseball, I was his tomboy. Those are really the only good memories I have and I couldn’t have been older than the second grade. I even wanted my shirts to match his so we would go to the gap and buy matching button ups. I’m really very feminine but I just loved him so much I wanted to be like him. 

But I’m guessing this is when his drinking must of gotten worse. When my parents got a divorce I couldn’t have felt more relieved. I went to bed crying every night before their separation due to the arguments we would get in. I have no idea what they were about but I distinctly remember always going to bed in tears and my mom dragging my dad into my room to apologize. 

By the time I was a preteen I was extremely depressed and felt like no one in the world aside from my mom liked me. It wasn’t even just that, I actually felt that certain people’s hated me. I remember my teacher being one of them and my dad the other. 

Sometimes I look at my friends who have super awesome dads and it blows my mind that there are actually people out there who have both parents who care for them. 


I just saw a video circulating Reddit of the girl on the cooking show who couldn’t open a jar so she ran over to her dad in the audience who opened it for her. The comments were so beautiful. I was in awe of all the people who felt that their dad was still possible of going to great lengths for them and being the most dependable person they know. I am so happy for those people, but it was really the first time I considered I might not actually have a dad.",23Apr2019,1
122,"Gen Z are still coming into the world, no-one can make the kinds of assumptions that they do about them yet. Millenials still have so much potential in them as well - it's not possible to write them off yet. 

I saw an article on LinkedIn, making the claim that the September 11 attacks were what split Millenials and Gen Z, and then followed up immediately with a specific year of birth that split them instead. 

They insisted those born during a certain year onward were Gen Z, and those who don't remember 9/11 were Gen Z. I was born in that year and remember 9/11 very clearly! They keep making sweeping generalisations about the most individualist generations yet, claiming to have these people all worked out, and it shits me up the bloody wall. 

Bonus points if it's some sour old man or woman in corporate dress. Completely out of touch with Millenials and Gen Z, but still willing to claim a position of superiority. Very frustrating!",23Apr2019,1
123,Evening all. Looking for some general advice on how to just chill out again. Stupid things have started to make me angry or upset very quickly and it affects my whole mood for ages... I don't want to bring people down with this attitude and I know there's no point in being irritated at tiny things but it's not so easy! Lovely people of Reddit- how do you get through a day without feeling so negative? X,23Apr2019,1
124,"I feel like such a lazy asshole, but here we go. So I'm in 10th grade, and I took two AP classes this year (chem and US history). My tests are in a couple weeks, and I've seriously got to double down. I really don't know where to start - it's so overwhelming. And as for motivation... I've got done. Discipline? I've got to be somewhat motivated to do that. 

I've got commitment issues. I write. And when I write, I can't stick to a story for more than a few weeks, at most. As for this, I don't know if any plan I come up with I'll be able to follow.

I'm probably the most stressed I've ever been. Please... someone give me some advice.",23Apr2019,1
125,"I am a Secretary (43F) at a very small machine shop and have worked there for over 2 years.  I work up front and have contact with almost none of the staff in the back so there is only 3 people upfront where I sit.  I work with an Engineer (53F) who works up front with me and she and I have become friends. We have quite a bit in common, no kids, (we treat our dogs like our kids) we like beer, music festivals etc. Plus we actually live about 5 minutes from each other so we car pool, hang out after work, go to happy hour and have lunch most weeks when the office shuts down early.  I was out sick today and she sent me a text that said ""she was uncomfortable that people know we are friends and she doesn't like people asking her about me""  She then went on to say ""she is weird and it upsets her that people were asking her where i was and what was wrong with me""  I told her I was very sorry and I totally understand that its a small office.  I told her to tell people that she doesn't know anything about where I am or what is wrong with me if they ask. I went on to say that she could just tell them we really aren't that good of friends and I just chat with her because I sit up front alone.

My feelings are a little hurt and I am not sure what to do.  Do you think I should just leave her be at work and stop chatting with her?  should I stop hanging out with her or going to happy hour?  this is really coming out of left field I don't think I have ever acted inappropriately in the office.",23Apr2019,5
126,"I made this as throwaway account for obvious reasons but essentially I have a female friend who i have known for years now. The issue is though is that I have always been kind trying to talk to her and help her through some extremely tough parts of her life (from a life changing diagnosis to her ex using her, cheating on her and breaking it off with her). I have always tried to be there  and i know she is in constant pain from her condition and all I want to do it help but things got abit crazy as of late. She is insisting on being  with me but I have a gf of almost 5 years now to whom I love with everything that I am.  But in denying her she kept insisting. She is from a different country also. Then she is starting to say "" well I am going to show your girlfriend pictures of you sexting me and being with me"". Which then she links all of these screenshots with messages from kik (which i havent used since I was like a teenager) . In there are entire conversations of lovey stuff but its not my old username or anything but includes what looks like some pictures of my fb page or some old social media stuff i had.  I just dont know what to do and i can't calm her down or anything. Whenever she seems calm she spikes back up to being furious.",23Apr2019,1
127,"Society generally thinks teenage boys are dumb and harmless, but their interests are fine and they aren't singled out much as an issue.

However, teenage girls are seen as the worst and so often people have issue with them. They're the worst for their interests. Ex) various boy bands, books like twilight, ect. They're always targeted and belittled for these interests and looked down upon for having them.

They're seen as vapid, selfish, and basically an overall negative to society. Yet, I feel the vapid selfishness is just a general teenager thing. 

If a teen girl looks good and is very interested in dating/sex, she's seen as a slut. If a teen boy does the same thing, he's normal and cool.

So odd. That's all.",23Apr2019,5
128," About 10 years ago my life changed. My parents volunteered to watch two dogs. We gave one away and we kept the other. Her name was Dolce. I grew up with her by my side, and I always defended her no matter how many times she would get up and run through the neighborhood. It got to the point that a simple yell or tone change could get her dashing back to our house in a heartbeat. She slept in my bed every night. She was my best friend. I would do anything for just another hour with her.

She fought a losing battle with cancer and was put to rest on March 1st of this year.

Back in October of 2018, my mom went to her high school reunion in Kentucky. She decided to adopt two kittens in Lexington and bring them back home. I made them sleep in my room the first night they were here.

One kitten was very chill, if she laid down she didn’t want to move for a while. We decided to name her Gamora, because she was very relaxed, had a beautiful face and gorgeous green eyes.

The other kitten was adventurous; he didn’t want to stay in one place for very long. He played with the dogs. He knew how to sit, beg and roll over. He licked the food off of plates, he’s even taken chips out of bags before. We named him Quill. He had a quirky attitude, I can’t even explain it on here. He was a lover and a fighter.

Easter morning we found out that Quill had been seriously injured by another animal. We took him to the ER to try and get the situation mended as quickly as possible. Our fighter was hanging on for dear life. All we were able to do was pray that one day soon he would’ve fought this infection to the point that he could’ve lived a healthy life. We visited the vet this morning, thinking that everything was okay; That’s when we found out that everything really wasn’t okay. Our boy had gangrene spread throughout his hind legs. We didn’t want him to suffer anymore. We said goodbye. All of us would kill to have him back. He was OUR good boy. He lifted rooms as soon as he entered them. All of us love him.

I never thought that I would lose two of my best friends over the course of two months.

May Dolce and Quill rest in peace.  
I hope the both of you are having the times of your lives up with the good Lord above. We’re so sorry that it had to be this soon.

Dolce - March 1, 2019  
Quill - April 23, 2019",23Apr2019,9
129,This may be long but I really don't know because I'm writing as it comes to me. Life wasn't always fun growing up but I had a sibling who I talked to a lot but ever since high school graduation he went off to college and of course I was upset well after that wore off he transfered schools and we don't talk much at all and I really don't know why. (This maybe hard to follow but this is my average thought process daily) After hs I began working a full time job straight from hs no training no nothing which isn't good as for the job is welding and certifications are needed well the start of my senior year I met the love of my life we are and have always been happy with each other and funny enough we met on Facebook but lately we have been dealing with our mom's waring back and forth and I feel as in a state of havoc sometimes and I love my gf to the moon and beyond and we know the problem and it's outside influence within us and we do have that much down which we are both metal heads which is a plus is a factor but not to ramble on too long. If anyone has made any sense of the touch and go situation and has a clue at all feel free to comment.,23Apr2019,1
130,"I've been best friends with this guy since the beginning of high school, and we've now been friends for almost 4 years.  He's gay and I'm bi.  

He knows this, but he doesn't know that the reason I realized I was bisexual was because I figured out I've been crushing on him lol.  I've been friends with him for over 3 years, and only now realized I've had a crush on him.

So basically my dilemma is this.  How in the world do I tell my fucking best friend that I have a crush on him??

 It's so fucking weird because we've been friends for so long, this isn't like a new relationship.  But only now am I beginning to realize I have strong feelings of attraction towards him...

I need advice desperately.  I feel like I need to tell him, but if anyone of you have been in a situation like this before and it didn't work out like you thought it would please let me know.  

WHAT DO I DO???",23Apr2019,1
