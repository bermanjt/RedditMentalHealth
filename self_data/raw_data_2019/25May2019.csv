0,"I'm a Black man. My wife and I are one of the only Black couples in the neighborhood. My White neighbors never say hello to me or even look at me. My wife and I were out doing yard work yesterday and our White neighbor next door to us was mowing his backyard and didn't mow his front yard to avoid speaking to us. The White couple across the street from us have NEVER spoken to us in the time that we have been there. Another time when I was out raking leaves, the White man who lives next door to me was out there too. I said hello to him and so did he. However, all of a sudden he stopped raking his leaves and went to the side of his house. Then I noticed him peeking over at me as I was raking my leaves as if he was trying to wait for me to leave.

The White woman who lives down the street from me always avoids eye contact with me. Whenever I go out when she's out, she never speaks to me. Whenever I ride by her she avoids looking at me. However, she is always friendly to my wife. She is such a b&amp;tch!

Another time when I was out in front of my yard, my White neighbor who lives next to me was taking his dog out to relieve himself. During the whole time he took his dog out, he didn't glance over at me ONCE to say hello or even nod. He kept his head down the whole time to avoid looking at me, then he sped walk back into his house. It's like he is afraid of us. He's so antisocial.

I don't know it's like they don't know how to act around Black people.

Are most White people like this towards Black people or other minorities?",25May2019,1

2,"My whole life, I've always been a loner sort of person. Always more into ""nerdy"" kind of activities that can be done indoors on my own, rather than team activities that are not that much fun unless done in a group, like most sports. Such as drawing, writing, reading, watching movies, playing video games, etc. And the only sport I like is swimming, which I always do on my own. And as a kid, not so much these days as a 17 year old high schooler, but I used to spend a heck of a lot of time using my imagination to play with my toys. These days I'd rather use my imagination in drawing or writing than playing with toys, but it was super fun while it lasted, and I've kept a few of my childhood toys to remember those times. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've had a few close friends throughout my life, and though I enjoyed their company while it lasted, I never felt they were a requirement for me to be happy. They were good, of course, but not mandatory. And I've always felt more free when just by myself anyways, since though you can share a lot of stuff with your closest friends, at a certain point it's just inappropriate to overshare, for the sake of your reputation. Even super goofy friends who are not judgy people , there's a certain limit to how you should act around them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Same goes for my parents and other family members, really. Around my family, since I've known them since I was born, I've said some really stupid shit without thinking, and to this day, they haven't forgotten the shit I said. It sometimes gets frustrating when I'm trying to make a point, but they keep reminding me of something unbelievably stupid I said when I was like 10 years old or so. I wished I watched my back more around them in my childhood, and though I love my family, when trying to maximize my fun to the max, I'd rather just do it to myself. They probably just banter cuz they love me but at times it does get old and annoying fast. 

&amp;#x200B;

**HOWEVER, despite all the above stuff**, whenever I read about or watch friendships in the media that I watch...it's honestly the best part. How the characters interact, how they stay faithful to each other, would do anything for each other, etc. All of my favorite pieces of media have that type of thing to the maximum. And it can be anything, really. From live action, to cartoons, to anime, etc. I just love seeing the characters connect. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you want me to name out some specific examples...I don't know if my list is good, since I've sort of been limiting myself to just fiction for a long time, but honestly, a lot of pieces of media incorporate friendship anyways, since it's a basic beloved theme. Though some delve deeper into it than others. Harry Potter, Indiana Jones, Star Wars, Game of Thrones, Jurassic Park, One Piece, Dragon Ball Z, Coco, Finding Nemo, any Studio Ghibli film, Life of Pi, Lion, Avatar: the Last Airbender, Your Name, even Spongebob to an extent, Adventure Time, Guardians of the Galaxy, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

And honestly, all the moments that make me cry are always the ones that involve two or more characters making a connection in some sort of way. 

&amp;#x200B;

Though I do like some good shows where the characters kind of hate each other...such as Breaking Bad or The Office, where in the former none of the characters are really too fond of one another, and in the latter everyone is just sort of an asshole in some way. 

&amp;#x200B;

But the ones that move me the most are always the ones with friendship or human connection shown. 

&amp;#x200B;

**It sometimes makes me question whether I'm truly happy being a loner, or whether I'm just comfortable with it.**

&amp;#x200B;

Because if I don't care for friendship in real life, why do I love seeing it in media?

&amp;#x200B;

But then again, I don't really see how the friendships I see in media could be applied to real life...

&amp;#x200B;

In media, especially fictional ones, characters are often put in scenarios where they have to overcome unbearable obstacles and go great lengths to save one another, and it therefore pretty much forces the characters to become close and like each other, whether they like it or not. 

&amp;#x200B;

But in real life...those sort of chances just don't come. I could sit with these guys at lunch and try to get to know them better...or just sit by myself. I could chat with my family who will probably just rip on me as soon as I open my mouth...but I'd rather not. The same opportunities just don't seem to be there. 

&amp;#x200B;

And I envision real friendships to have a serious side to them...but in real life, things just aren't as serious. Characters in media often fight to save their universe or whatever...while in real life...we just go to school, and go to work, and there's not that same sort of magnetic pull to pull us together. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know. Maybe I'm just kind of crazy. Maybe I'm mentally ill. Maybe I just live in a delusional world where I expect reality to be like fantasy...but who knows. I just wanted to write this somewhere, and get it all out. I'm also kind of curious to see what people might have to say, but that's not the main reason I wrote this. Though I'd be more than willing to listen and conversate a little on the topic! And this is WAY too long now, so I'll add a TL;DR for your convenience. 

&amp;#x200B;

  \---

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR- So basically, in real life, from childhood up till now, I've always been a loner sort of guy, who preferred to do what are considered rather ""nerdy"" activities all by myself. However, in the media I watch and read, nothing moves me more than the connection between two or more characters who genuinely love each other or are great friends, or whatever. It's odd, since in real life I don't really care for it, but in the media I consume, it's always my favorite part. The part that affects me the most.**",25May2019,1

4,"Im lost on what to do. Is life about self improvement? 

I dont know how to make friends or how to talk to people mostly girls, i see people as gods mostly girls.

Im tired of chasing their approval/attention and them not giving a f about me or not even caring about me, they talk to me cause they feel sorry for me. Makes me feel invisible.. tired of people pleasing and ass kissing just to be my friends, 

I ask them questions like im their fucking servent
Im literally worthless..

I dont have a personality im boring as hell and bland. No charisma i aint fun either, i dont have opinions or thoughts on anything...im just a boring bland r/niceguys, i aint cool.. im generic af. I dont have banter with anyone and i aint funny.
i feel stupid af and feel like i can never be smart. Im passive or aggressive.. 

I dont even know how to do small talks, i dont know what to say to new people i meet. 

My convos are always like interviews with everyone.. all i talk about is nonsense no wonder no girl ever likes me. And i have always been the one putting all effort in or asking questions first.
Then i run out of ""boring questions to ask"" 

Always me doing the chasing.

I dont know how to ask intesresting questions or be interested in other person. I dont have a smart brain like you guys.

For me life is all about textin girls and porn or at least was. I have stopped watching porn for 4 days and stopped talking to girls. Its like i want a GF so bad to make me feel better so i chase it.. maybe i need self love first. But idk what it means.

In my life im important to no one no one loves me and i compare my self to guys with GFs or friends or their money.

Now im overwhelmed by advices and i have so many problems i just want to end my fucking life. 
I dont know how to fix them.

My anger is raising up at my self for not doing shit. I just want to smash my phone into pieces. 

I feel like if i be positive i will be lying to my self.. like saying ""im smart"" but im really not.. then it becomes high ego.

Why is it so hard for me to make friends.. idk... or make girl-friend online? Its so effortless for someguys. What do i have to do to make people like me? What do i have to do to make friends?

What do i have to do to have a personality and not be boring/bland/worthless and stop chasing peoples approval or people pleasing?

I want to be a footballer in future but isis was in my country this country aint for dreams for anybody..i live in a small town no therapy or much hobbies to do.

I go outside there is no fuckin thing to do...

Im tired of complaining.",25May2019,5
5,"Recently this has been a problem for me. I still have sexual drive but it feels like I don't have the willpower to act on it anymore. Nowadays I actually feel worse around women, like I am always self conscious and I am worrying about how they feel and burdened. But when I am by myself I feel much better and I can just do whatever and it makes me feel OK. Not good but just OK.

  A few weeks ago I was drinking with this girl and she took me to her house where we were alone and she wanted to hook up. She was really pretty and we connected very well but I just didn't really feel like it and I declined the advances. And now she is dating someone else. 

Shortly after some other girl asked for my phone number and called me saying she wants to suck me off but I just simply did not have the mental energy to follow through with it and set up a date and so I didn't. I don't really know why I didn't, I just didn't.

My old self would have instantly jumped on these opportunities. But now I procrastinate on them as though they were school assignments or chores. I just do not feel the drive and the urge to pursue them even though I know on a conscious and a logical level that I should be. I really dislike being in this state. What is wrong with me? How do I fix this?",25May2019,1
6,"I hope this is the right place to post this sort of thing, I'm in need of some advice and I am unsure what subreddits would and would not allow this sort of post.

Sorry if it just seems like rambling at certain points, I struggled to convince myself to write this and what i should and shouldn't include

TLDR: I can't get attached to people and I don't know If I need help
 

I have been unable to feel any real connection to other people. I don't feel anything towards my parents, my sibling, or even my friends. I didn't question this and just thought it was normal. 
Recently, I realized how strange it was that I don't feel anything towards my own parents and that if they were to suddenly pass, I wouldn't feel any different.  
I'm not even sure I'm aware of what something like love feels like. My parents are good people, I know they love me, but what is that supposed to feel like? Is there supposed to be a feeling attached to knowing that you are loved? What does it feel like to love your parents? I know that there is something you are supposed to feel when you are attracted to someone, but all I feel is that strong sense of nothing.
I decided to try and look up the fact that I can't get attached to other people and it eventually led me to Emotional Deprivation Disorder. I match up with a majority of the characteristics of EDD. Obviously I can't say for certain that I have EDD until it is diagnosed, which leads me to my problem of: Do I actually need help or am I just unable to correctly identify my emotions?",25May2019,1

He's in college and I work a full time job so our schedules are both very busy which is why we usually plan about a week in advance. 

This whole week he's been busy with school so we haven't talked much but today we haven't talked at all...I messaged him 6 hours ago he opened it an hour ago and hasn't said anything. I'm so dumb. This shouldn't hurt like it does. I really liked him and I should've known better than to let my guard down again.",25May2019,1
8,"Recently a whole lot of unforeseen events have changed my outlook on life and I realized just how much I hate people. I have friends and colleagues that I genuinely enjoyed being around with but now I just don’t want to see anyone or be with anyone. I work 7am-3pm and after that I hit the gym about 4-5 times a week, run daily and have discovered a passion for music and it’s creation. But I can’t help but think that these people around me are slowing me down, like they’re holding me back from my true potential.

I used to be a heavy marijuana smoker but since slowing down drastically from 7 or so bowls a day to a joint a week, I noticed all my friends are potheads, yeah they work and go to school but no one can go a day without being high and sitting on their ass. Even the ones that don’t smoke at all are lazy, all they want is to party and go out all the time to do things that aren’t improving them or their life’s. I see it as time wasters. No one is doing anything to improve their life’s, they’re all content. I’m not. I hate this life but I’m willing to work hard to change it and I can’t help but feel that those around me are my anchors.

I am scared of loneliness though. I’m fine with being alone for weeks, months even, with minimal interaction with friends and family. But I get scared that leaving these people around me behind will cause me to have no one in life. Especially since I’m the kind to not go and socialize with strangers. I’ve gone to concerts and movies alone and pretty much any activity you can think of, I’ve done alone and enjoy doing it alone. I’m good with the women but I can’t bring myself to trust any of them and so I can’t commit, I kinda don’t want to either. So marriage is out of the question and so is a future family. 

I know there’s no way of knowing for sure, but will leaving everyone behind change anything for the better or worse? Am I just overreacting? Any of you feel the same way?",25May2019,1
9,"I’m not saying to be a rude asshole, but just be honest with people about who you are, your flaws, your mistakes, and your skills, and what you know you deserve. 

I’m realizing that people actually prefer honesty and I’ve noticed that when I just say what’s on my mind (within reason of course) they respond way better than I would fear in the past. And anyone who responds negatively to you being honest and genuine, then they can go f themselves because all you can do is your best and being who you are and doing it as honestly as possible. 

Stop people pleasing people.",25May2019,3
10,"I'll try to make my case sound as reasonable and non-teenage angsty as much as possible, so please here me out.

I’m 16 years old, about to become a senior in high school. In the 7th grade I met my first real group of friends who I liked. For the first time I went to birthday parties, movies, etc. with people other than my family. But as high school started, and people would join and leave our group, for some reason I slowly began to do less of these things. I'd still talk to them, but I'm definitely losing the closeness I had with my friends when I got to know them in middle school. And even as a result, I've felt fear about going back to that, because I'm scared they don't like me anymore. But recently I've decided to make the leap and finally start to become more social.

I asked my dad if I could go to a gathering that I was already hesitant to go to in the first place, and he said no. He kept  asking me what we were celebrating, and he said it was just a hang out. After I pleaded my case for about five minutes, his conclusion was that ""there was no purpose in our 'hanging out.'"" He refused to say anything else.

I feel so depressed. Not necessarily because I'm not allowed to hang out with friends, but because I feel like there's no chance for me to ever get out of my loneliness. Even after I stopped actively avoiding social gatherings, when I do make the jump, there's the hurdle that is my father. I feel as if my father is a great factor, directly and indirectly, in my behavior.

My mother told me that my father had one good friend growing up, and was not the social butterfly---in great contrast to my mother. Even to this day, it's painfully obvious that my adult dad struggles in making friends with people. He'll invite people over, put CNN on the TV and have the most awkward small talk. I'm no therapist, but my guess is that the loneliness that he experienced growing up still lingers with him, and is somehow subconciously being projected onto me. I am not sure if my dad really sees the true value in friendship, but as teenager, I think I am definitely starting to. And I'm learning the hard way.

As a kid, I never went to other people houses, played games with them, or anything like that. All I did was sit in front of the TV and watch cartoons. I didn't even play those online games where you didn't even have to be in the same room. It was just me and my two little brothers. Everyone else I knew I only saw at school or church.

Even though I said in high school I started to avoid gatherings, there have been many instances where my dad refused to take me anywhere without good reason. I know my friend group doesn't drink, heavily party, or snort coke through their asses or anything, and my parents know that as well. So I don't see why my father is so adament on me not going out. I feel so stuck in my own little bubble. I feel so distant from everyone I know, even my own family. I have no one to talk to, no one to vent to, I even feel depressed knowing I have to come to reddit to rant. I have one more year of high school left, until I go to college and probably have to start my social life over. But a whole nother year of loneliness is too much to bear. Once I get to college, I feel as if I'll even become one of those people that only finds satisfaction in partying and drinking, because I rarely ever left my house growing up.

I know there are probably people in this word that have it way worse than me, no one to talk to at all, probably living in a situation where everyone they know hates them, and for that I'm truly sorry. For me, I feel no satisfaction in the small talk I make with the different people in my five periods at high school. I feel no closeness with anyone and in the past have pushed people away because I felt inadequate, and still do. I really don't know what I'm asking for or why I'm posting this, but just needed to vent. I guess if you have any advice to how to deal with this that would be great, thanks!",25May2019,1

You're an idiot how can you contemplate even considering asking that girl out. You've never spoken to her and you're a disaster of a man. You have no dating experience, think about it at your age that's  a bad sign, keep it to yourself. You still live with your parents, you don't have a stable job and you're a depressed, suicidal fuckup. Learn to accept you're supposed to alone. Stop thinking about women, stop thinking about having friends and learn to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so much.

14,"So I've been out of college for a couple months, having finished my degree in English. I haven't held a job since my sophomore year of college and being a socially anxious introvert, the idea of having to constantly interact with people for 6-8 hours a day makes me want to just end it all.

I've spent my entire life preparing for adulthood and now its *actually* here and I  just do not feel ready AT ALL. 

I have held 3 jobs in the past (all of them quite physically/socially demanding, as most food service jobs are), and I never felt like I had any time to myself, even when I wasn't at work.

When I worked, I would come home, and I would not have the energy/desire to do anything except lay in bed and watch movies.  

Before work, I would spend all my time dreading that I had to go to work in a few hours, and it made it impossible to enjoy doing anything. 

I think there are a lot of people who feel this way but the truth is nobody says it because they are afraid of being labelled an entitled millennial, or a lazy pos or something. 

I'm going to bite the bullet and put on a brave face and go to work everyday anyways, just like most people do. That doesn't change the fact that I unironically will think all the time about dying.",25May2019,1

16,"Rewind to May 2013 when I walked at high school graduation. It was arguably one of the worst nights of my life. To start off, both sides of my family came. Mom’s side and Dad’s side. It’s not secret they hate each other. Not my actual parents against one another, just their relatives. Mom and Dad are fine together. So both sets of grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc didn’t get along at all. And when I did walk, a group of those who bullied me booed me. Actually booed me during my graduation walk. I never fucked with anyone, always kept to myself, was your average “socially awkward nerd who got picked on”. And then the night ended with a former crush, who already rejected me in the most public way possible a year previous, started yelling at me about how I’m stalking her. She was a junior. So how am I stalking her at my own graduation? I had gone home that night and cried myself to sleep. Six years later and I still have nightmares about that event. Worse, I feel like I amounted to nothing. I feel like graduation was a waste of my potential. I feel like I want a do-over. 

Upon leaving high school I didn’t have a set plan. Well, I did. Truck driving was my plan. That plan didn’t go well. So now I’m stuck trying to figure out where my path in life leads me. College was never part of my plan. Maybe community college for some courses to satisfy my curiosity and need for learning. Or trade school to give me something to support myself. My true aspiration is to be a writer, so my plan was to get a stable job and write until I get published. 

Lately I’ve been feeling incapable of achieving that goal. Lately the idea of college has been popping into my mind. The problem is I could never settle for one major. My educational interests change every day. I could be fixated on astronomy one day and it would change to government the next. That, and being broke, we’re factors that lead me to never attend college. But now I’m starting to think it may be a life preserver. If I could find something to commit to. It could also be my shot at redemption. The chance to make new memories, new friends, make a name for myself, and maybe not get booed at graduation.",25May2019,3
17,"Another day that I’m looking back at the pictures of myself a year ago, staring with self-assured confidence into the camera. No chubby cheeks, defined jawline, toned facial expression, and that glaring, smug grin mocking this fat, puffy slob that is currently viewing the picture.

So one day, I tell myself: “What are you doing to yourself man? You are taking your good genes and covering them with layers of McDonald’s and Five Guys and shit”, and try to stop eating junk food daily. Here comes the usual night out with friends, and I’m getting wasted. Drunk hunger strikes again, and another doner kebab is devoured before I could even have any second thought.

So I take the Tube and arrive back at my dorm, drunkenly sending pics of the evening to my mates and as I’m about to post on Instagram, I see my gallery. There is old me a few scrolls down again, jeering at the mess that I am.

I recently made a post about telling my parents I'm depressed and want to die (Suicidal) I haven't actually told them per say but I asked my mom to make a therapy appointment. It's in 2 weeks and hopefully I can make it till then. But I have asked and I am getting help. And I was asked how long I've been depressed. I was depressed in 5th grade and ran away in 7th to kill myself. I didn't succeed and got help. I was in therapy for 3 months before pretending I was ok because I legitimately thought I was. 8-9th grade was ok. I didnt try to kill myself but I thought about. In 10th grade (right now going to 11th grade) I started to cut. I was like a canvas and my brush was my blade. I had again tried to kill myself by overdosing and not succeeding but no one found out. I'm going to 11th grade after summer and I've finally reached out for help after talking to the suicide and depression number and talking on here with some fellow redditors.

22,"So, I have been talking to someone via Reddit for a few days, and they asked me what kind of background I have in education. When I mentioned Psychology, they asked me why, so I decided to answer...so here it is....

I didn't have an easy childhood and I went through a lot more than what other people my age go through in a lifetime. My adulthood was not easy either. Things have gotten better and I have a lot I am thankful for and I have worked hard for everything I have. 

I picked psychology because I wanted to heal, to understand why the things that happened to me happened. I may not have all the answers, but I have an understanding. I absolutely HATE when I don't understand. I feel like everyone has the right to understand an action or a comment or whatever happens to them. I hate it when people refuse to let me understand why something happened, why they said something to me or did something to me. There is always a reason why someone reacts like they do, and if it towards you, you have a right to know. But that is my opinion. 

I know plenty of people who tell me that they don't have to explain, they don't have to do this or that, and that is correct, BUT don't make comments or remarks or take action if you don't intend to explain. It is a basic level of human respect. Kind of like if you have nothing nice to say, then don't say it, only if you don't want to explain, something you are about to say to me or do to me, don't do it. 

As I dug deeper into psych and got into my core classes, I actually started to heal from some of the shitty things that happened and it paved the way for me to find resolution with those who were shitty towards me. One, a family member. We are working on our relationship and have improved the overall relationship. This person calls me often to see how we are doing and I do the same. We go out once a week to talk and connect as family and how we should have always connected. 

It has also allowed me to make peace with those I could not talk to. Some have passed away. Some are very toxic for me to be around, and some just don't care, so I don't intrude on their ignorance. 

I loved writing self reflection papers on myself and I was able to pour out my feeling on paper. It has been a few years, and sometimes, I look back on those papers and I can see how far I have come since those times. 

Other than wanting to better my life and getting the job I wanted, I needed an education and psych seemed like a good fit for me. It gave me peace, confidence, and the courage to heal from some of my past.",25May2019,6
23,"I have a coworker whom I consider as a friend. She is a bit older and has a family of her own. She's been in the company longer and definitely has more experience than me.

Recently, it was announced that we are both up for the same promotion. Weeks after that, she has become very critical of my work and has even been critiquing the way I supervise my team. At times, she wouldn't even come to me; she'll go straight to our manager and start off by saying ""I've just sort of noticed that...""

She uses qualifiers like that. ""I just noticed"", ""I think"", ""I may be wrong but"", ""Maybe you should"". I'm all for constructive criticisms but most times, her feedbacks aren't even logical. I don't want to think she's sabotaging me because we are friends. But lately, I can't help bit think she's trying to dig for some dirt even though there is none.

I don't even want the promotion. I told my boss that I am not ready for it but she thinks I'm just being modest. I do believe my coworker is the best person for the job and I am actually lobbying for her to get the promotion.

It makes me really sad (and pissed off) that a promotion could make her turn against me. Or maybe that we weren't really friends in the first place. I also cannot help but think she just befriended me for the sake of keeping a close eye on me.

I have never been more happy. I’m crying my eyes out. All the emotions that I’ve been keeping inside are finally spilling out. The joy of finally being allowed to study where I want to study, the relief of finally hearing a YES and being able to tell people I’m going, the sadness of leaving my family and friends behind, the fear, the excitement, everything is just mixing into one big emotional ball causing me to cry for the last hour.

But I’m probably just making too big of a deal with it and it’ll all be fine and I should stop overthinking it it’s just hard because I’ve been so scared to let myself experience emotion I’ve had to hold face for so long. The last 3 times I’ve tried to go to school I’ve just gave up and not shown up after a bit. Because there’s always some traumatic shit happening. I just don’t want to fuck up again I’m constantly paralyzed with fear that somethings going to go wrong that I never attempt to do anything in life.,25May2019,1
34,"Sorry if I'm all over the place. This happened hours ago but I need to get it off my mind some how.

I get it, shes got problems. Shes mentally disabled. But she was still capable of punching me in the arm with force multiple times to the point that it impacted my ability to work quickly the rest of the day. I'm a 5'1"" female. This girl had at least 6 inches on me. And she's swinging her fist down on my arm relentlessly until I cried out and her caretaker looks over and tells her to stop. All I was doing was trying to help them. My attempt at the best customer service I could provide ended with me being assaulted and walking away in tears to find a manager to take over for me.

The manager later said the caretaker apologized and said the girl just didn't know what was going on. I was also told there is nothing the company can do as she is mentally disabled and it didn't seem to have been done intentionally. If I want to file charges then I have to go to the police myself.

Even though everyone else is telling me I should. Or the caretaker should be the one to face charges for failing to notice she was losing control. For not doing anything to prevent the incident. I still can't justify pressing charges against a mentally disabled person or their caretaker. For a bruised arm? Being forced to work slower for a bit? 

But I'm still finding myself crying hours later. I've been abused in the past. But in my 3 years with this company I've never had a customer hit me. I think a part of me has lost that sense of safety I felt at work. Even when customers verbally abused me, they never hit me until now and I realized I subconsciously felt my workplace was a safe place. But that feeling is gone now. 

Part of me can't process what happened.",25May2019,1

46,"My main source of income is working 6am-2pm at a grocery store. I specifically worked it out with my boss there that I would only open so that in the afternoons/evenings I could work/close my 2nd job. My 2nd job is a restaurant that opens on Memorial Day.  We’ll have different schedules once the grand opening happens, I hope, but right now the entire night crew has been working until 3:30-9pm for a week. But this restaurant will be open until midnight on the weekends, which makes it extremely tough on me now that my boss at the grocery store has decided that 2 or 3 of us need to be at the store at 5am on the weekends to stock shelves instead of 6am. I just worked open to close between both jobs yesterday and the day before. This morning I do the same thing, except it’s almost 4:30am and I need to leave for work and I am BURNED OUT. How changing the schedule like this without notice acceptable?  Only a couple employees are expected to do it too. That’s what kills me. I’m not even getting 40 hours there.

I know things seem crazy lately. I acknowledge those saying God must be all-evil if he does nothing to prevent these atrocities. The idea that He could not stop it from happening is laughable nonsense. So it's a question of His ethics. Perhaps He is bad and this is what He wants?

But, by that logic, God must not be all-evil since  things can be much worse and yet aren't. Again, certainly it's not a question of God's ability. The same God that can miraculously do good can also miraculously do bad. (If you misinterpret this as a mafia-like threat, then you do not understand omnipotence.

After finally finishing my contract and saving up enough, I get a call from her telling me that she's getting engaged to someone else.

A couple days later, I get news that one of my closest friends passed away. The whole day I had a pain in my heart. It's the first time I've experienced a loss this close to me, and I couldn't stop remembering all the memories we had together.

For a few days I felt aggressive &amp; angry. I became reckless to people and it drove some away. I got therapy, and it helped a ton, but I'll be damned if this loneliness &amp; broken-ness doesn't kill me.

I went to a Ben Platt concert on Wednesday, and I resonated with every single thing he said. He sang a song called “Older” (I highly recommend listening to it) which is about how he has a hard time living in the moment because of his anxiety. This was my lightbulb moment; I finally realized that I also have anxiety and that I’ve been suppressing my emotions for as long as I can remember.

The next day I decided to go on a walk by myself, which I’ve never done before. It was six miles along the Pacific Ocean, and it was so cathartic. At the beginning of the walk, I was completely in my head. I kept worrying about literally everything. But by the end, I was finally living in each moment and actually listening to my emotions for once.

I am a male, a teenager at his best part of his life in highschool or that's what it should be. Ever since i was a kid i am afraid of ball or anything that could possibly harm me so growing up in a neighborhood where the kids play soccer every single afternoon i joined them but i was quickly got left by them cause i suck at soccer because i am afraid of it(still until now) so that's where my mental issue starts to build up, in elementary school i was the king of anti social i had no friends no one to talk and if i had i would only talk to them so this makes me dependent of that person and when they got tired of me they left me, they avoided me and this hurts me and makes my trust issues grows even bigger. In junior highschool i jumped from being the no.1 loner to the cool kids, i used to hang out everyday not studying and got called to the principal office for series of trouble, i vaped, smoked, drank alcohol and stuff but i drop it all off when I'm at the 9th grade cause I'm just tired of being the cool kids, i can't express myself and this makes me feel weird so i left that life style and i just go back to my old self, gradually losing all the fake friends but i managed to get a gf somehow but we broke up in 3 months maybe and it's just not fun then i met a girl that i like(lets nickname her ""E"") and i shortly became close with her and because of my trust issues when i spend time with her i became lifeless doll, i do not have any expression and i feel depressed because I don't know what she thinks of me and at one point i thought that i was close enough with her, i asked her out and she said ""no, you said that to lots of woman"" which i denied cause it's wrong, i almost had no other female friend except one of her friends (lets call this person as ""K""); but even though she rejected me i kept being friends with her and her friend, i asked her out again after a year cause i always had this feeling of urgency that i need to know that this person that i am close with isn't taking me as some guy they toy with (they talk nicely to you but laughs at you with their friends), i feared that and after i asked her out again she rejected me and then she told me this ""i am tired of you, please go away"" i do not know what i did wrong, i did what friends do i do not cross the boundaries and she is the one who always cross the boundaries and i just tags along with it if she lets me so i broke down but luckily i got some pills(I don't know what the doctor puts in there but after i take one I'll sleep like a baby) and after 3 days of being disgusted to the point that i had to force feed myself so i don't die i finally got a hang of myself with the help of ""K"" and after a week or so i realized that it is not ""E"" that love, it's ""K"" that i actually love so i came up to her and i told her everything because we are close friends (at this point she just broke up with her boyfriend and i helped her through it too) then i asked her out because once again i got pushed by myself because i felt the urgency to be validated by the person that i love but she told me ""right now I can't love anyone cause i just got hurt"" which is probably a lie and means ""I can't see you more than a friend cause you're not attractive"" so i said ""it's ok, i know i had it coming"" so after that she let me come over to her house and we became even more closer but she is under heavy surveillance by her parents which makes me hard to contact her and if I can't contact the person i love i feel like i am being dumped away again or left again, so it made me sad everytime she doesn't respond to my texts and it frustrates me. She is leaving in like 5 days from now to USA because she is forced by her parents and i bought her some presents today and the present was like 1/5 of the average person's salary in my country so she asked me ""why you bought me all this?"" And i really want to tell her that it's because i love her but i do not have the courage so i just tell her ""its parting away present"" and a few moments after that her parents told me to go home cause it's already very late then when i came back home i texted her again because i really want to talk with her but she didn't respond so i came here to the reddit to tell my story.

Maeng Da 1.5 G in 2 caps from Urban Ice Organics ; I have no clue whether or not it's any good so any advice from people out there would be appreciated! I have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Fibromyalgia/ Spinal disc disease in cervical/lumbar spine and am on OxyContin , Norco and Ambien and do not know how much to start with . The reason I ordered the Kratom is for any little bit of energy I might get as I live my life in bed day and night . I have decreased my dosage of opiates dramatically in the past 8 weeks and am down to half the dose I was taking in order to try the Kratom safely and see if it might be helpful . I used to get a little energy from the higher doses of opiates ; They do not cause drowsiness in me but rather give me energy and pain relief. 
This illness has taken any quality of life I had and I live life in bed . If there is anyone who reads this post who deals with this illness and has gotten relief of pain and severe fatigue from Kratom and either takes it with opiates successfully or has been able to wean off of opiates and is getting better results using Kratom ..

104,"(21M) Today, despite the rainy weather here in Montreal, its been sunny inside my head, which is something that had rarely happened for me in the past few months. 

I have been dealing with major depression since last november, which I honnestly didnt know how it happened. On paper everything was going perfect; I was begining my career as a Special Need Counselor at a local Elementary School with awesome co-workers, I was with my GF for almost 4 years, and I had a healthy social life with many good friends. But some things werent quite right, and it seems like I had to go through depression to finally realise it. 

I have been dealing with social anxiety disorder and self-esteem issues for a long time. I've never been satisfied with who I am and keep working as hard as possible to overcome my weaknesses and please people around me as much as I can. Being a shy guy by nature, it takes a lot of effort for me to do basic things like small talk, meeting new people (and posting this actually!). While doing that, I slowly but surely drained every bit of energy I had and became feeling sadness and losing motivation in life. But I kept going as long as I could... Throughout winter I had to drop my ADHD medication to start trying different anti-depressants, most not working at all or making me overall worse. I met my wall at the end of April. As I gradually started feeling more and more depressed, and my body started to physically shut down (fever, blackouts, even worse attention span, muscle pain) and I had to do the thing I feared the most, which is taking a break from my job. This, however, symbolised a new begining for me, because, with the help of my doctor who convinced me to do it, I took a decision for my well-being. 

This break was however not all rest; since I had a lot of time to strictly awnser my needs and listen to my heart, I did a huge cleanup in my life. I started going more regularly to the gym, taking better care of my body, and I started seeing my friends and GF more often. 

Last wednesday, I took one of the most difficult decision of my life; I broke up with my GF. Although she was a very loving and caring girl, things were just not working out on my part and I dragged it on for too long because I didn't want to hurt her. Although it is still painful, I truly believe I did one of the best things I could, because, again, I took a decision for myself, for my well-being, not to please others. 

Right now I am starting to feel motivated again. I went back to work and was warmly welcomed by my co-workers and students (including a huge collective hug from my 11-12yo students who I play  cosom-hockey  with at recess, which was the most heartwarming thing! ^^). I have great support from my family, friends and co-workers, and the meds seems promising so far. I have a lot of exciting (but stressful) things I have to look forward, like dating (which I am terrible at but will have to learn) and a promotion at my summer job (I'll be leading a team of students in Special Needs which helps the integration of kids with disabilities in regular groups in a summer camp). 

As for the social anxiety, I finally feel the strenght to work on it and learn to trust myself and be my quirky-happy self in social situations. 
My first goal was to create a reddit account and use it to socialise with strangers and get stuff off my mind like right now (which feels really liberating). 

Thanks to anyone who read this! It feels good to share a little piece of my story and my newfound optimism with you! :D

108,"I am a 22 year old university student living in Canada, about to go into my senior year. I live a life that I feel many people can describe to be somewhat privileged: attending a world-class university in a well regarded and rigorous program, interning at a major financial institution that allows me to live comfortably and afford my tuition off my salary, and meet plenty of cool and interesting people through my DJ side gigs. With all that, I still feel like something is tearing me down, every time I try to build myself up, as if happiness is constantly just out of reach. I'm not suicidal, nor do I feel depressed, but more of a feeling of mania if my life isn't moving. I feel like my privileged position has become a wall for me to try to share these feelings, and I think its starting to tear me apart as I can't begin to figure out why I am feeling like this. The only thing that seems to make these feelings go away is giving myself new challenges to overcome, as I think I have a fear of conformity and falling into a mould.",25May2019,4

111,"Out of nowhere, my friend’s friend told me “You’re really pretty.” I haven’t been told I’m pretty by someone who’s not my family in a while. I had no idea how to respond. I wasn’t wearing makeup, I’m on my period so I feel extra bloated and chubby, and out of nowhere she just goes “You’re really pretty.” I’m elated. I feel on top of the world knowing that at least one person sees me and thinks “Wow, she’s pretty.” I’ve always thought that I’m average at best, but to at least one person, I’m pretty.",25May2019,24
112,"We were talking about our neighborhood and I was joking about how sketchy it is (there was a shooting across the street a few months ago and his home has been broken into twice). He took offense and said it was a good neighborhood so I teased him that he doesn’t even like going to the gas station or 711 after dark (which btw was robbed minutes before he got there once). He said he wasn’t scared of going to those places- he just doesn’t like ME going there after dark. I asked why and he said that sketchy ppl like 711s and he wouldn’t want me going to any 711 after dark.

I’m a feminist and I don’t need a man to protect me and I don’t feel unsafe at any 711s lol but I found that very endearing. Just that amount of love and concern for my safety. He has locked me into the car while he’s gone into 711 while saying he just didn’t want the car stolen with me inside. 

But for real we do kinda live in a sketchy neighborhood lol.",25May2019,7
113,"I have my own mental health issues. I'm having an anxiety attack as we fucking speak. It runs in my family, on both sides. I have had a full on nervous breakdown. I have survived almost losing my only child , Dec.13th, 2008. She survived and is healthy and is my rock star. I survived self medicating with alcohol and a drunk. Thankfully and proudly sober 09/25/09. I lost my mother two years ago from a lifestyle of heroine and pain pills and I hadn't seen her in 25 years , literally the hardest day of mine and my three brothers lives, we are all sober. My brothers for years, all over 20 years clean and sober. I have had some days is what I am trying to say. I would never leave my child to bear the aftermath of his mothers suicide. Never have I even thought about since the day I gave birth on 07/26/93. I find it the most selfish and cruel act to play on a child and life you brought into the world is now left the burden and heartache which is unexplainable. Its unforgivable because I fucking know what that heartache feels like. When our mom chose drugs over her children, she left us and broke all our hearts. It's just took 25 years to bury her. It took her 25 years to come back to us. It fucking hurts. No matter what we love our moms. We needed them and we deserve to have them in the life they gave us.",25May2019,1
114,"Movie is pre-production, we start filming next month.  In the meantime I've been helping anyway I can to help keep up momentum, running some errands, social media etc... The director is the lead and I'm the female lead. We kissed in private the first time we rehearsed. It was good. But I had my walls up. I really just wanted to stay professional but he kept pursuing me. I should say he was never inappropriate but really flirty. I mean, I ... am the full package (and sound so full of myself OMG). I'm beautiful, long hair, big natural boobs, great size 6-8 curvy body, funny, tough, humble, a tomboy, a thrill seeker and academically intelligent. I'm used to guys not being able to control themselves around me, I'm honored. I feel blessed. So, I played and flirted and laughed with him, but kept putting down the boundary and we both found it funny. 

But then we kissed again. We continued to go places and get stuff done for the movie.  But then my walls came crashing down, we took a day trip and I just wanted him. Bad (I suck)! Nothing happened. I thought about it. But I COULDN'T resist. So I made some excuse the following Monday while I was in his area, to see him. He walked up to my car and I kissed him. Like really, really kissed him... no holding back.   And then we proceeded to kiss for like an hour almost everyday for the past week. And I loved that feeling of wanting him so bad but not actually doing anything further than making out. I told him that I wanted to enjoy our time, this phase,  because who knows what will happen after we're intimate. We might not feel the same, or awkward or whatever and then someone gets hurt. And he's like, 'No babe, don't say that. That's not us,'. Etc. Etc. ETC.  And I believed him and us. 

So we booked this trip to scout locations in the mountains, we leave in a week to make connections and bring on vendors to the production. But it was exciting because we knew it would be 4 days away together to play and finally have each other.  

I would say we both are spiritual, determined individuals who enjoy a lot of the same things. He's a bit of a celebrity but I didn't know of him before I was contacted. He's a really 'cool' guy. Umm.. oh and the chemistry.   

Our chemistry! Is unreal. Just the sound of his voice or looking at his photo is enough to have me involuntarily squirming in my seat! And vice versa. We've been obsessed with each other for the last week. There's no way he's seeing someone else. Maybe talking but he's a free agent, I know that. Honestly he's not long-term material. I just wanted ... for us to enjoy each other, maybe for that to translate to the screen and, yeah naively, for us to get out of this peacefully and happy after filming's done or it had run it's course.

So anyway, we had planned to go have a drink tonight. But, yesterday I had time and we ended up having lunch, going shopping and then going to a couple bars and having drinks. And in between he was 'bringing' me so close, it was absolutely euphoric. We went to the last bar and had the whole place to ourselves and a huge couch. Stayed there for ages. 

Oh and I should say we've moved very fast emotionally. He's been saying he loves me, and I finally said it a couple days ago. I just feel like he gets me, at a way deeper level than normal. 

Anyways, back to the bar. He's been saying let's just go to a hotel all week (you know, once you've made out for an hour it's very tempting) and I've been shutting it down, trying to be strong and telling him let's wait til our trip. So he said it again and I said, 'Ok, let's go.' I think he thought I was joking at first and then we made a mad rush to the nearest motel, yes motel. 

Um... the experience was really good but he was really big and hurt me, I'm still hurting. And... he was really... going at it hard. Maybe because he'd had a few drinks. I loved that, but what if that's all he can be? I know I know, he was probably trying to impress me but I don't need that all the time or for that long! I don't really know how to be honest about what I want though without hurting his feelings or making it awkward. More awkward than it already is!!! Urgh.

I'm still going out of town with him, I don't have a problem being professional and when I say I'm going to do something then I commit. I'm not going to let the team down or give up this project just because of sex and feelings. I can find my way through to the end of this project. 

But my feelings... I can't wrap my head around what exactly I'm so upset about. I feel weak. I wanted it to be ... exceptional, personal... special. But it was just really good sex. He was tipsy, I was weak. We let go, but the connection wasn't there. 

So he didn't text last night afterwards and we always text, we call each other like five times a day, everyday. He didn't text this morning. He texted about 1pm and asked for some business details. Then called and left a voicemail about going out of town today to some festival we said we might check out because there would be potential investors there. But we were invited to go Sunday not today, not sure why the dates changed. Then he texted that he couldn't go after all. So I just gave it right back and discussed pending business. And I'm pretty sure last week he told me he had his kids visiting during Saturday afternoons, so that's probably why he hasn't called. 

I really don't want him to know I'm feeling this. I don't know how to approach him. I don't want to be vulnerable. Or dramatic. Or feeling, I want no feelings please. Please? 

I don't know what to do. What's right or if I can live with doing what's wrong. Or which one I even want. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Sorry this narrative is a mess, I keep coming back to it, to complete it, and I'm stressed out and confused and frustrated and crying and mad at myself. And using really bad grammar and I hate typing on a phone. I feel so freaking weak and stupid. Wtf? Shit.",25May2019,1
115,"I've struggled with the dislike of my looks since the age of 10. 
I can never relax my thoughts. Where ever I go, what ever I do I'm giving myself hate thinking I'm not looking good enough to be seen on the streets, to have the friends that I have etc.
Like I understand that I'm normal looking and that there's really no big problem. But my mind wanders away so easily to the extreme, mostly in public.

My biggest problem with this is settling down with a job. When I first get a job I can pretend I don't care and act all normal, trying to be my best social self and make a good impression. But after 2 months or so I start to panic, I overthink every tiny thing and imagining that no one likes me because of my face. I start to look for other reasons why I dislike my job, loose all my motivation and then end up quitting a few months later. The past few years I've had around 7 different jobs, and ended them all because of how uncomfortable I am with the way my face looks. 

Because of this I also avoid a lot of social things, even if I see myself as quite a chatty person. So many friends and relationships that I've been throwing away, even starting to feel that I'm drifting away from my family. 

I feel really embarressed about this and I dont really know what to do anymore.
It's starting to get lonely and quite tragic.",25May2019,0
