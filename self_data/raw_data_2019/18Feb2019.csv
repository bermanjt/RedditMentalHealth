0,"Hello,

So I am the youngest of four, only son, I overthink, have anxiety, maybe still have depression, no thoughts of suicide (yay), partially out ‚ù§Ô∏èüß°üíõüíöüíôüíú only partially because my mom does not approve and I currently have a secret boyfriend while also going to college for mechanical engineering. Yesterday I ran into an old classmate from high school, did the little chit chat niceness and then we went our separate ways. Later I find out he‚Äôs gay and just got engaged. (congrats him ü§ôüèª) I check out his Instagram because I don‚Äôt have him as a friend and I look and this is where it gets tricky like idk how to explain my feelings. I‚Äôm like thinking can I have a redo on life? (again not going to kill myself) This guy is out, engaged, more fit than he was in high school, working and seems genuinely happy and I‚Äôm like damn why am I so complicated? I am in love with my boyfriend and I deeply care for him. I would be crushed if we broke up. üíî He is very caring and understands my many dark demons. I hate myself in thinking that he is not that attractive looking. Like it‚Äôs not what I was expecting to be in a relationship with. Before coming out I thought that if I had a cute/attractive looking person (other people found my boyfriend good looking) that it would be easier for my family and everybody else in accepting me as gay. I‚Äôm not a perfect 10 I know that. I am a skinny white boy that has barely any muscle or fat and has no talent for anything. I am also sarcastic and mean spirited. I don‚Äôt know what I am like. I feel like I can‚Äôt do anything: workout/build muscle, be sexy, do well in school, do basic human things like errands and just be able to deal with life. It‚Äôs like this old classmate brought up all my shortcomings. Like he‚Äôs engaged and just like out there in the world living and I‚Äôm in a major that I have no idea how I am going to finish it even though I keep trying, living at home and because of my mom not being fully accepting it‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt just go out. Not like I could just go out anyway I have no money, social anxiety and get very nervous putting gas in my car or driving in traffic. I am and my current situation (mostly me) is holding myself back. I‚Äôm not living and it sucks but I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôm scared of everything, I hold myself back so I don‚Äôt get hurt or be vulnerable. Did I hold myself back with relationships? School? Fitness? Social life? I think so. Do I regret it? I don‚Äôt know I am just unsure. I am 22 and it feels like my life is over (also not gonna kill myself) Like I am missing out on things I don‚Äôt know. I am in a crisis... 

But don‚Äôt worry about me. ",18Feb2019,4
1,"I'm always on drugs to give me happiness. It's a scary relationship we have. They're my comfort when I'm down. They're my healer when I hurt; 

My lover when I'm alone. 

They protect me from the real world that I can't seem to face. 

My heart flutters when I see that xanax bar. A few hours of being free and happy. Another few hours of making the people around me happy by radiating happiness that isn't mine. 

I'm not Colt anymore. He's gone. I'm a shell filled with medication. 

My personality has been drugged away. 

I love being positive to other people. When I'm sober that's not me. I want to hide what I've become. I don't want that to shine through. 

I want to be kind. I want to be happy. 

It's not our achievements in life that should measure success. It's the impact we have on other people.

2,"I just need a place to write this down a guess, or to speak my mind at random. But my whole life, I felt this weird longing with a tinge of sadness to it, and today I found a word to describe that. This may sound dumb or lame, but life has always bored me, always. This is why I love video games, or movies, or books that are non-fictional, I want to life in a different setting. Real life is so boring to me that it makes me legitimately sad sometimes, that I don‚Äôt live in some kind of tv show. I exercise, I‚Äôm trying to make the effort to get out more and make friends, I‚Äôm pursuing a higher education, and I have a great relationship. But I always have this wistfulness in my head, a longing that I cannot shake for something more exciting or fun in my life that I‚Äôve never been able to find. 

Thanks. Peace out.",18Feb2019,3
3,"Today I was determined to get my nose pierced. After about 10 years of having one, I had to take it out for a job 3 years ago and have missed it ever since. I have a new job now, and they don‚Äôt care, so I wanted to make it happen. 

I recently moved to a new state so I‚Äôve been searching for places to go to get this done for a couple weeks and every time I was able to go check a place out, the piercer wasn‚Äôt working. This happened at like three different places. 

So today I finally found a place and the piercer was actually there. So I went for it even though I didn‚Äôt do much research on the place outside of read a couple yelp reviews. 

He did my nose and it went fine, so I mentioned I was also looking into a daith piercing because I tend to get migraines. 

He said no problem and got me set up. I walked out of there with minimal pain and stoked I did it without fainting tbh. 

I get home and looking up how to clean them and I realize... he didn‚Äôt give me a daith piercing. He gave me a rook piercing. Ugh. Now I‚Äôm completely stressing out and my irrational thoughts of how this will ruin my life start to set in. Because I‚Äôm also nuts. 

So I did more research on THAT piercing now that, we‚Äôll... I have it... turns out it‚Äôs supposed to help with releasing stress. Hm. I could probably use help in that department too.

So... I now have a rook piercing, and even though it wasn‚Äôt what I asked for, it‚Äôs pretty cute, I dig it. Getting jewelry from Etsy now ü§ó",18Feb2019,1

For a while, we were able to keep up with each other and keep in contact. But since my senior year started we only talk when I text them first and even then they respond late.  With my best friend, I feel like we don't really click as much as we use too. We would drop everything just to hang out or play a game together but now it doesn't seem like that anymore.

7,"Background:

So I just found this sub and wanted to talk about this. I loved playing console games mostly on Xbox 360 when I was younger with pouring countless hours into gears, halo and cod but slowly got into pc gaming with team fortress 2, Minecraft diablo 3, counter strike: source and league of legends. But after time I lost interest for many reasons so I asked for an Xbox one and to my surprise got one. I was excited to play Xbox Games I missed on and with the Xbox one S bundle came game pass for one month. I was beyond surprised to see the insane amount of games on there for that type of deal. It beyond amazing!

Also game fly was a thing when I was younger and then disappeared then Redbox is still a thing to my honest surprise. That also fed into my amazement of game pass being a thing.

Not literally. But it's like they have an energy that's more intense than that of other people. They're not everywhere. I could count all the one's I've met on two hands. But these people, The Glowing Ones... You know exactly where they are in the room. You're tuned into them on some level, because their existence and proximity demand your attention. Even if you close your eyes, you can still *feel* them, sense their movement throughout the room. They don't have to say anything to earn your attention. You don't even have to know them. You're just Aware.

The Glowing Ones draw the attention of everybody, not just you. People talk about them. Everyone has an opinion. It's almost like that glowing energy is a magnet. It stirs up all that comes near it.",18Feb2019,10
9," hey guys, its EpicCringelord with another unpopular opinion, today it's about the western concept of men.

 

disclaimer: i use the words males and females, so dont get on me like ""FEEEEEEEEEEEEEEMAILS""

1: when they talk to me with speech like ""hey bro"" or ""sorry about that man"" no, fuk u for assuming i'm one of you, i'm not one of your kind

2: when they talk about stupid sports and football all the time. HEY BRO DID U WATCH THE GAME LAST NIGHT????????

3: when 99% of them have short hair even when it doesn't suit them. i cringe every time i see a short scrawny indian kid with a high and tight Chad haircut. it's like lipstick on a pig. if you're a fair lil cute male, you should go with it instead of trying to be macho

4: the shallow way they communicate with each other. male-male friendship is not natural and human. they only make eye contact one every 5 seconds. what's the point of male-male friendship if you cant look at each others faces and connect. oh wait, that's too gay.

5: when males have the attitude of ""i want a girlfriend"" instead of ""i want to make a girlfriend out of this particular girl"". thinking you approach random females instead of forming relationship with female you already know. its not like fishing, where you catch any random girl. it needs to grow organically from someone you know, so that there's magic

6: when males view females as a strange alien group, like being a female is extremely different from being a male and it's an alien experience that you'll never be able to relate with. well, unless you have a very masculine bone structure, chances are you could totally live as the western stereotype of a girl for a day, by buying makeup and a dress.. you could totally experience how girls are treated in daily life, and it's not that different

7: never brave enough to try straying away from the culture they were indoctrinated with. u can try wearing a cute sweater, or having cute long hair. males can be cute like girls, too. they dont have to be like troglodytes and gorillas and brutes. im not sayin u have to flip over to the western feminine role... just that u can be a cute male, and it happens that cuteness is associated with western femininity",18Feb2019,0
10,"All my life I‚Äôve wanted to work in a creative field: comics, video games, books, and most of all, movies. It‚Äôs just so natural to fill my head with stories through out the day, and while I don‚Äôt think any of them are the next Odyssey or Citizen Kane I just wish I could see my vision on a big screen. 

In tenth grade, which was seven years ago, I made a video project that was far and away more ambitious than anyone else‚Äôs. It‚Äôs stupid and choppy and poorly acted, but it‚Äôs *my* movie. I don‚Äôt think about it very often but whenever I do I am proud of myself. 

I‚Äôve never been able to do anything like that again, mainly because of age. I‚Äôm just twenty-two. That‚Äôs an adult though. All my friends are adults. It‚Äôd be crazy to try and make anything. I have no experience and no time. I almost minored in film but I hated, like literally despised, the man over the program who teaches ALL of the film classes so I switched minors. 

I‚Äôve taken to writing and I‚Äôve had super small success on reddit. (You‚Äôve never heard of me or even read anything by me, but it was enough reads that I felt happier than ever.) For a while that satisfied me. But I can‚Äôt do it anymore. I‚Äôve lost the will to write. I try and I try but I can‚Äôt let the words flow.

I had someone approach me about writing a story for them and they‚Äôd pay me, and I never was able to even start it. My dream of getting paid for what I do was there in front of me, and I let the moment pass by like a cloud. 

I have money in savings, not a ton but enough to make a micro budget movie or pay myself to write for at least two years with what I make at my current job in retail, but I‚Äôm too fearful to take that risk. That‚Äôd be stupid.

I used to have friends in highschool, but I've unintentionally pushed them all away by repeatedly turning down invitations to hang out. Bad move. Now I see them hanging out on social media and having fun, and feel sad that I'm not even invited anymore. 

Now I'm here, sitting alone in my room, feeling miserable about myself. All I've got is my family and my lover who lives thousands of kilometers away. I don't know how to make new friends, or reach out to my old ones. I don't know what to do.

It‚Äôs weird because in high school I think I felt good. I worked to get good grades, my room was organized, I enjoyed reading and watching movies. But for the past few years my motivation for anything has slowly started to drain away. I feel like someone could offer me a million dollars and I still wouldn‚Äôt feel better about anything. I feel like everything I do is forced nowadays. I don‚Äôt really know why I feel this way. My self esteem has gone down a lot and sensitivity to things has increased as well. Sometimes I‚Äôll just fall into a hole of telling myself that I‚Äôm good for nothing and stuff like that and then an hour later I‚Äôll feel a little better about it and I‚Äôll forget why I got upset in the first place.

17,"Some background. 24 Female. I don't date. Never had a bf, gf or significant other. I also don't have many friends. My sister and Brother in Law are the only people I hang out with besides my parents or family. 

There's this guy. Let's call him M. I'm not really into him but he's very insistent. He messages me everyday. Talks about Pokemon ALL the time (it's a bit annoying sometimes). He's nerdy, just like me. He's an anime fan (so am I), listens to country music and he's religious. He loves movies, Marvel (like me), and plays nintendo video games (I'm an Xbox fan). We've been to a couple of movies together (Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War). 

He's a nice guy but I do find him a bit annoying and a bit too loud. I'm also the type of person who listens to a lot of music. 99% of it rock from late 60s all the way to the early 2000's so music to me music is a thing I look for in people. I also hate his grammar and spelling. I ALWAYS have a hard time deciphering what he's saying. 

I have my flaws too. I admit that I'm HORRIBLE at keeping plans. We've made plans to meet up to see movies or hang out but I don't really follow through with them. I know it makes me look bad and untrustworthy but I can't help it. My usual response is ""I'll try to make it but I'll let you know"". I sometimes even roll my eyes and/or groan when I see it's a message from him and sometimes leave the messages seen or unopened for days. (Record for unopened msg: 1 week). I know I'm HORRIBLE. I know he gets frustrated and I feel bad about it.

20,"This person has a huge track record so I'll try and make this as short as I can. It was a MAJOR rabbithole that just seemed to go on forever and some of her articles are archived in old archive websites such as TheFreeLibrary. This is not your ordinary cancer hoax fraudster, there's something very strange about this woman.

She is around 32 years old, but over the past 22 years, she has used multiple personas and identities to make her condition seem more legitimate. In her most recent incarnation she has pretended to be a 19 year old girl named Lindsey, when her first persona was named Heidi.

Her condition is so blatantly impossible no sane doctor would ever take her seriously (there is zero scientific evidence this disease exists at all) and biologists would bust a gut laughing at it. She often gets ''relapses'' or a ''thief'' breaks into her house and steals this spacesuit she has to wear so the family ask for 2,000 pounds worth of donations. Lately she says she's writing a ''long awaited'' book that no publisher in their right mind is going to publish.

She makes up personas similar to how a troll will make multiple sockpuppet accounts and then use these identities as an excuse to mercilessly spam the same argument to try and make it seem more credible. But she is very intricate when it comes to the exact details so I can instantly tell its her. Also the ''photos'' of her look like stock photos.

Her family has helped her do this as there are news articles about this woman from since she was 8 years old, with her parents telling the narrative for her. Her parents first and last names constantly change also. She recently fled Reddit because she made the mistake of posting to a debunking thread on her, only to be shot down by Redditors who pointed out that her disease is impossible. It got featured in r/murderedbywords and r/subredditdrama iirc. I'll try and find the article later.

I remember seeing the latest incarnation of her from last year, in the Daily Mail, but even the Daily Mail commentators (as dumb as they are) pointed out how ridiculous her claim was to the point the mods got upset about it and had to shut down the comments for the article. She gets like 4 or 5 articles made on her every single year.

Her story/disease has so many contradictions I am surprised she repeats them over and over, because these contradictions literally debunk her ''illness''. Is this just an expert troll coming from a family who likes to troll the press, or is something more serious going on here?",18Feb2019,0

And God, this account has been me. You can scroll through the history of it and see how I've grown as a person. How I've found myself and changed and done something with my life. I was looking back on some old saved posts earlier and wanted to cry, really. 

I miss the friends I used to have, the experiences I missed out on. Finding myself earlier in life, or finding my direction sooner. I moderated with this account. I grew up with this account. 

I'll forever have the password, until one day it's forgotten about and deleted. That's okay, really.

I really need help with love guys (Long story ahead)

&amp;#x200B;

So i'm a grade 10 student, just coming by and just making my last year worth it. Fat but i believe there's something more. I have a crush on my classmate who is drop dead gorgeous but no one really made a move on her (yet) so i said 'I'll be the first'. She's a cadet officer in the student corps but that wasn't the reason i fell for her, i fell for her personality, her charm and overall general well-being to be around. We just met in this grade year but i wanted to know her better. So in mid-december while we were nearing the end of our retreat (boys and girls were seperated) , i bought a ring there, initially for my mother but i remembered her. So i gave it to my close girl friend (mind the space) to give to my crush. She was shocked that someone had given something to her and was dying to know who it was. So when they went back from their retreat, my classmates teased me, a bit too much, since she already knows who gave her the ring. So we kinda seperated for a bit never really interacting for fun but when needed. I came clean to her and confessed my feelings (which was a bad move when remembering) on christmas eve but that only deepened the wound and made our relationship (before any of this) worse. So for the whole month of January we never talked or interacted in class or in chat. 

Fast forward to February (more specifically Valentine's Day) i hadn't prepared anything for her, roses, plans or anything. I had a reason why i didn't bring roses for her; the prices were SO HIGH like they were joking (but i get that they need to make a profit on valentine's and they were the only store their) But luckily, the student council was giving away roses to chosen few on the morning of Valentine's. the mentioned friend (who gave the ring) didn't want a rose so she gave it to me to give to my crush. And when i did give it to her, i played a song on the guitar i bought along to serenade the couples in the room and lighten the mood. Now, she won't even acknowledge or pay attention when i say stuff like: good morning! and hello. I feel like air passing by to her. I don't know what to do guys, i want there to be something more and to know her better and i feel like it's not a simple crush. ",18Feb2019,1

32,"I'm an extreme shut in. I was raised as a shut in and I went to a girl's home where I wasn't allowed to speak for 6 months unnecessarily. Ironically there was a girl who showed up the same day I did. She was allowed to speak at 3 months. She was allowed to leave at 6 months, even with a legal contract to stay a year. I stayed 2 years and 1 day. They never treated me as an equal. I'm timid as hell and I do my best to not show it. People always seem to want something when they show interest in me. I met a few younger girls who I try to protect. I find the experience shitty, but worthwhile. This is another one of those things.

I made a friend online and knowing them is changing my life. They are an actual good person, and it blows my mind. They pushed me to get out, so I did. One day I will realize it's my own power, but right now I don't think I have that ability. They are trying to help me with that and I'm extremely grateful. I want to show it. 

I socialized and went to a bar with a friend girl. (I have poor boundaries. She used to be a friend with benefits who came to me. She used me back then and I was ok with it) 

She was using me again. She and her boyfriend got into a screaming fight and I had to break it up. They didn't quite notice that I was blackout drunk.... for the first time. They didn't have water, and their place stunk so bad I kept drinking just to breathe. 

I woke up with a large bump on my head, and bruises on my legs. I called her out on her motives for what she wanted from me (a substance I sometimes abuse) I didn't give her what she wanted. She didn't tell me I hit my head. I'm pretty sure I went to sleep with a concussion. I won't tell him how badly it went for me, but I needed to tell somebody. I'm not going to do anything but cut ties, and learn my lesson. 

I'm doing my best to not be clingy. Not be desperate. Have some self respect. Invest in myself... but the more he puts into me. The more I learn from him the more I want to give him. I want to give him too much, and I know I can't do that. That's not how friendship works but this is so confusing. I'm back in school as a high school drop out. I have 27 credits, only needing 22 because I lacked the proper guidance. I have the wrong ones. I started over at 6th grade and became a junior in 2 years last time someone believed in me. Unfortunately they didn't count but I'm still proud. I think I can actually do it this time.

There is no way to tell him how I feel without putting too much on him. I've already put too much on him, but his voice makes me feel at home. I said the words ""I don't deserve this"" and told someone no.  The words shocked me, and I knew it was his influence because those words were new too. I actually give a shit kinda, and maybe for the first time in my life. It's not fair to put that on anybody, but I wish he could know.

As a sex addict with psychological damage this is so hard for me. I haven't been fucked since I started raising my standards. These boundaries are so hard to keep. If he was a bad person, he would be exploiting me right now. He refuses to and I'm nearly in tears over this change of reality. ",18Feb2019,2

34,"Me and my girlfriend had a argument because she made a threesome hypothetical and asked if i wanted to do it. Weird question to ask since she is the jealous type. I have this weird thing of always saying ""not really"" when i want to say no. So when she first asked i said not really and it just went to far down hill. I don't want to fuck another girl and i don't want to watch you get fucked. Very simple. But since i didn't say that at the start we just argued and my confusion just turned into me getting sad because she said something that set me off. I realized some of the things i was saying and hung up the phone. I just hate hypotheticals that have obvious answers. Obviously i don't, i want just you but you act like i don't anymore because i suck at talking. I don't want to fuck anyone else. Just stop with these questions i already answered. I know i should've said no, not only because it's what i want to say, but because it would have prevented this. Stop making hypotheticals and get surprised when we get uncomfortable. I hated that call and didn't enjoy a second of it after that. I hate myself for getting so mad at her, it was getting penned up since i was mad she wouldn't end the conversation but i wanted to keep it cool and ended up blowing up. Im sorry.

So since about 7 months ago, I've had some drastic changes in my life. I left my city for a job, my long term girlfriend broke up with me and I feel like I haven't been doing anything productive with my life. 

All I really do nowadays is binge watching Netflix, gaming and sometimes just sitting on my couch thinking how miserable my life is for hours.

Of course I do the occasional drinking and going to the pub, but after a while going alone is not so fun anymore. 

So here I am having a quarter-life crisis and not knowing what to do with life. 

Any suggestions on where I can start? I'm just so bored with everything when I'm not at work and really making friends is pretty hard when all I do is work-home back and forth.

41,"Ginny was currently in the store getting some coffee. Harry said he‚Äôd meet her at the bus stop. He shook his head as a car relentlessly pushed his horn as he flicked through his book. He was just getting into it when he heard a soft thudding nose and felt the approach of a woman coming unreasonably close to him. Harry didn‚Äôt look her way and willed her to sit down, at least an inch away from him, perhaps, when he felt finger nails-red-caress his stubble. Harry made a small noise and looked in front of him. He saw the curve of hips, quickly skipped over the breasts, the long neck and raised his eyebrows at the woman who was looking slightly dazed. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHarry Potter, is it? I know you.‚Äù She smirked slightly, but Harry hardly noticed 

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ If you don‚Äôt mind I‚Äôd like some time alone please. I'm just focusing on...""

Harry slowly looked back to his book, and willed himself into the letters.

The woman suddenly became preoccupied with her handbag and began ruffling through the lipsticks and makeup and notes. Suddenly, a lot of the contents thudded onto the floor. Harry looked at the ground for a moment, begun to stand up, and looked back at his book. The woman seemed to have trouble picking up the things. Harry hurriedly bent down in a feisty effort to get this over with. He stood up gently to give it to her, when the woman jumped on to him and Harry collapsed into the bench, numb. Harry struggled, but the woman kneed him and he let go for a minute, and her lips closed over him as he struggled to breath. At that moment Ginny turned a corner and spotting it, stumbled backwards. ""Oh, shit!"" She looked shocked, and ran her hands through her hair, shaking her head, not knowing if this was for real or something she didn't really get. She screamed his name. Harry finally wrestled her hands off him and ran towards his wife. Tears suddenly sprung up in Ginny‚Äôs eyes. She walked towards the woman. ‚Äúwhat were you born doing?‚Äù She choked. ‚ÄúWho started this?‚Äù she looked at Harry expectantly. Harry was instantly grabbing Ginny‚Äôs arms to comfort her while the woman uncertainly walked away.

Ginny didn't know whether to pry him off her or not. 

A woman tried to break into their bubble by waving her arms in the air ""I'll back you up, I saw it was her who suddenly jumped on him."" 

""Who am I supposed to believe exactly?""

""Ginny, I know, just listen. She literally jumped on me.""

""Okay... Whatever, this doesn't make sense.""

""Look, let's get coffee""

‚Äúi can honestly say I'm not making this up"" the lady interjected. A man was laughing on the other side of the subway. ""That was an assault... By her, she's crazy"" he shouted.

""Alright, fine, okay...I don't know how I feel about this""

""Tell you what, let's make up for this?""

""Nothing can make up for this... But... Okay I get it's unlikely.""

It was only a month after Voldemort had been killed, and people were celebrating and throwing floating lights into the air. He did not want the ministry to cause pain now. Suddenly there was a knock on the door. Dumbledore smiled and let the person in. ‚ÄúSomeone has destroyed the memories for the pensieves.‚Äù

Dumbledore was quiet for a moment. ‚ÄúHow did this happen?‚Äù

Edis gave Dumbledore three passionate slaps. Dumbledore looked at her with a mixture of fierceness and boredom. ‚ÄúEdis, if you would like to talk to me-‚Äù. Edis stormed out, her shoes clanking on the hard floor.

Before he knew it, Harry was at the door. ‚ÄúUh, this isn‚Äôt a bad time?‚Äù

Dumbledore smiled. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never a bad time for you. You didn‚Äôt have to bring butterbeer.‚Äù

Harry gave Dumbledore a butterbeer, and accidentally knocked it onto his beard and face.

‚Äúprofessor, I apologise, it was an accident. But Hermione and Ron are waiting for me-‚Äù

45,"So this is my first post so enjoy :D.

So I was like 6 at the time of when this happened. My family and I were walking into Target to get some stuff like food clothes and some sweet sweet pokemon cards. I was walking around target aimlessly (like little kids would usually do) and asking my mother for the absolutely useless stuff like superman pajamas and other things like that. I was walking in the isle's and I found this shelf that played music depending on what ""cd"" button you pressed. The music choices were all classical music so like Mozart and Bach. (Yeah I know I was a prettyyyyy classy child.) I am pressing the buttons like a lunatic and not listening to the music. Me being the brilliant child I am I step on the little ledge on the front of the shelf (Which is connected to the shelf). And from the title, you can tell what happened. The shelf straight up falls forward and hits me in the leg. At least I rolled up into a ball before it hit me so it hit my knee. (In my. defense it should have been bolted down. My leg was gashed and I was crying on the ground for a long time. Eventually, the target workers come and call the ambulance. Now I have a pretty bad scar on my knee and have never gone to target since. The Target people kept up with us to make sure we were ok. Tbh they just did not want to be sued. The next time they called my dad said We. Are. Not. Going. To. Sue. You. Stop bothering us. Needless to say, they never called us again.

In the meantime, I've been working in data entry doing mindless work day after day and I really feel that I'm not putting myself to my fullest potential.

However about 4 weeks ago, I got a call from an engineering company saying that they wanted to interview me for an electronics design engineer position that I applied for a year ago. Hell yeah I'm doing this! I did the phone interview and an on-site interview and I thought everything ran smoothly and I did great! Two weeks pass and HR told me that they wanted to set up a 2nd onsite interview. Today was that day and as you can tell from the title it didn't go so well.

So yeah the managers had cancelled the interview. The interview was scheduled for 9:30am and I got the call from HR at 8:15am saying that the managers really wanted someone with 5 years experience and after some discussions they had decided that they wouldn't have the time to train me.

So right now I'm just sitting on my bed with my half tucked in dress shirt feeling really shitty now. So much led up to this and it ended in a way that I never expected.

It goes like this:
My dad was born in montivideo, Uruguay to a Latino Christian father and a Jewish mother.
After having him the mother contracted post-birth depression and when my dad was two she committed suicide.
This caused my dad's father to go kind of insane, he became an alcoholic and beat my dad (my theory is that he blamed my dad for his wife's death, because my dad has a sister but the father only abused him) and when my dad was seven he too killed himself, I don't know anyone who has had a tougher childhood then my dad and his sister.
Luckily for them their uncle (mom's side) who lived in Isreal took them in.
My dad never let that experience get to him, as a dad he was everything his father was not, he truly loved his children and never raised his fist at us.

His life was finally OK but then he got diagnosed with lung cancer (he hasn't smoked in sixteen years). We were told that if we were optimistic he might have a decade to live, I'm not an optimistic person so I thought that I'll try to do everything I wanted to do with him over the next four years.

He ended up passing three weeks after we found the cancer.

I'm 22 (F). In sixth grade, I graduated first honor and in high school, I graduated salutatorian. In college, I studied in 4 different universities (bc confused about what course I want) but still graduated with a high GPA (1.40) from an online college with an AB Psychology degree. I really didn't want to be a psychologist. I don't want the hassle of taking board exams and pursuing master's degree. I discovered a short course (Pre-Licensing Private Detective) and thought it was really interesting because I've always wanted to become a detective/spy when I was a kid. I took it up and finished it and got my own Private Detective License when I turned 21. Now I'm a freelance private detective for 1 year and in between I've worked for 6 months in a private detective company and a fraud analyst for 3 months in another company and a mystery shopper in another company. Now I'm applying as a fraud analyst again for another company because I was excellent at that last job I had and I liked it more than being out on the field.

As for my hobbies, I own an airsoft pistol, a sparring katana, a skateboard and boxing gloves. But most of the time, I play video games. I love punk rock music. I love anime and cartoons. I love action, spy, mystery and psychological movies. I extremely love my pets (2 cats and 6 dogs). I'm a minimalist. Most importantly, I love watching detective shows, especially the murder mysteries. I've watched SO MUCH of them that it almost makes me feel embarrassed and I've been thinking about writing a mystery novel one day but don't know how to start.

I have a boyfriend and we've been together for 7 years and we have the exact same story. We don't really have a clear future planned. I think the only dream we have is to be the best parents to a son and to have the happiest family and to work together in the same job.

Any advice, links, or whatever you can give me would be greatly appreciated!",18Feb2019,1

My mental health is something that has ruled over me for around half my life, so about 10 years. It started out small and pervasively destroyed my mental state and pushed me to places I wish I could never go back to. I sought out relationships that made me feel needed and helped me avoid the glaring issues I had with myself.
Through my own faults, I ruined relationships with good people and my mental health was no excuse. I turned what could have been something special into something abusive and horrible for both parties.
I am not proud of my past and my mental health is no excuse for how I treated them or how they treated me. A year and a half ago I was on the verge of jumping off my balcony and just letting go. Eventually, I sought out help and my mental state increased and I got happier and was able to forgive myself for the mistakes I've made and the people I've hurt.
As the year progressed I became comfortable in my own skin and learned to love myself and honestly have been the happiest I've ever been in my entire life. Relationships with my family are better than ever and I feel validated just by doing what I can and that is something I just can't express how good it feels.
I have been worried for sometime, getting back into a relationship and hurting someone I genuinely care about when I'm trying my best. But I met a girl on Tinder of all places, who has single handedly been the best thing to happen to me. She's kind, she's funny, she understands, and she doesn't fault me for my past. Honestly, I'm tearing up writing this right now because I truly don't feel like I deserve someone as good to me as her. And even now my mind comes in to yell at me that I don't deserve to feel this happy... Sometimes it really doesn't even feel real how happy I am. 
I don't know, I'm not trying to brag but writing this out makes me realize how much my life has changed and how worth it living your life is.
For those of you who are struggling, don't write your own ending. Hold onto hope as hard as you can. Even if it's just getting out of bed in the morning, that is more than you did yesterday and that is enough. To see my life change so wildly over the past year makes me realize how much I would have missed if I had chosen to end it all. It does get better, your life does matter, and you will be happier one day, I promise you. And above all else, you deserve to be happy. Just do your best, that's all anyone can ever do. ",18Feb2019,2
68,"So, my girlfriend been under a lot of stress with work recently, especially considering she got a new job a month or so ago. Anyway, she started becoming fairly distant a couple weeks back. She stopped replying to the couple of texts I sent her, so I assumed she needed space. After a couple of days of not talking she texts me saying  the following:

‚ÄúHey *Insertmyrealnamehere* Thank you for checking up on me but at the moment I think I need some time to myself, I hope that  you understand. I will text or call you when I‚Äôm ready to talk, but for now I am kindly asking for you to be respectful of the choice I‚Äôve made, I hope to speak to you shortly, ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù

I replied saying that that was perfectly fine, and that I‚Äôd give her the space she needed.


Anyway, that was a week and a half ago and I haven‚Äôt heard from her since. 

This is strange since we used to talk daily and see each other a few times a week.

So yeah, not sure if she just ghosted me and didn‚Äôt want to break up, or if she does plan to just have a week or two to herself before giving me a call.

69,"So tomorrow is my 25th birthday. It‚Äôs the most sad I‚Äôve felt about my birthday in a loooong time.
It just feels like nobody cares, and the more I thought about it, and the more I realized it was more than just that.
Tomorrow is going to be spent by myself and then driving two hours to pick up my mom from a train station because she decided to go spend my birthday with my sister in New York...
My fianc√© decided to spend all his money on himself so we aren‚Äôt even able to go to dinner unless I want to pay. There will be no presents for me because nobody‚Äôs around (I know that part sounds selfish...but it is my birthday after all)
My friends did plan something for Saturday BUT  managed to ruin the surprise on what it was so they canceled and they all made their own plans for that day, and my fianc√© didn‚Äôt plan anything else for the two of us to do.
It‚Äôs two of our friends birthdays Friday and Saturday and my fianc√© forgot I wanted to do something Saturday, and told his friend he wanted to celebrate with him on Saturday for his birthday by going somewhere I don‚Äôt even like, so it‚Äôs not like we could celebrate together, not that that was even a thought in my fianc√©‚Äôs mind.
All I had asked was that my friends and fianc√© come to the gym when I‚Äôm done work tonight (we usually go) so at least I wouldn‚Äôt be completely alone after work...they said yes but then change their minds and instead of my fianc√© coming with me, he decided he wants to go with our friends earlier in the day instead when I‚Äôm at work.
Every single time I make plans with my fianc√© and our friends, if the friends change the plans my fianc√© will change his to match theirs instead of mine.

I don‚Äôt know, I know it all sounds dumb but it‚Äôs just being built up over time.
I ALWAYS make sure that my friends or fianc√© have the best birthday. Even if I don‚Äôt have a ton of money...I always request off, I make a plan for their day, take them to dinner, get them a gift. I go all out. 
In return I get *nothing* and I‚Äôm just really tired of it...and before anyone says it: no, they are not planning a surprise for me. I know how they are, especially my fianc√©, and he just doesn‚Äôt think of things like that.
So I spent my morning crying and then I get to work til 10pm and come home to my fianc√© sleeping and then wake up to him at work. 
So I‚Äôm officially sad.",18Feb2019,1
70,"WARNING  - post involves domestic violence, sexual abuse, abortion.

My life growing up did not lend itself to high self-esteem or standards. I ended up with some really shady characters in my late teens and early twenties. When I think about the fact that one of them was murdered and one will be in prison for the rest of his life, its so bizarre. I no longer resemble that girl that dated those types of people and made such poor decisions, so looking back on it is almost like looking through the eyes of another person.

I'll call the one who was killed Raymond. I was 22 when I was with him... And I was actually pregnant with his child when he died, but I hadn't spoken to him in months because, despite the fact that I'd only been with him, he refused to take responsibly. He said he didn't know if it was even really his, and that I wasn't ""mother material."" I was so gutted by all this and never spoke to him again. I ended up terminating the pregnancy, and never even knew he was dead for years.

One day he popped in my head and I decided to Google him. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw his obituary. I clicked on it to find out more, and subsequently found a news article. He was shot in the neck right across the street from my  job after an altercation with some men in a car. First responders pronounced him dead. 

I looked at the date of the murder, and not only was I still pregnant, but I was probably at work. I'm not sure how I hadn't noticed a commotion right across the street... He died just FEET from the bus I took every single day. 

Raymond was involved in a lot of criminal activities and I'm not sure which one of them put him on his path to death, but I'm certain it wasn't random. I don't believe the local police ever actually figured out who did it.

The guy that is currently in prison I'll refer to as Scott. I was 19 when I met him, and very emotionally vulnerable. I guess he sensed how weak I was and aimed his sights on me. Easy prey. He was the most evil person I've ever met... Pure psychopath. 

To give an idea of how predatory this guy was - over the course of our relationship he ended up admitting to me that he'd molested his six year old cousin and had also hunted down a random girl to rape with a friend of his. 

I knew I needed to get away from him but I was so unprepared for someone like this... I didn't know how to fend off the stalking, harassment, threats of suicide. I was terrified of him. He had a violent temper and was sexually, physically, and emotionally abusive. 

I was a virgin before him, and my first time having sex was rape. I was saving myself for marriage and he knew that... But after he did that to me, my brain couldn't process it. I know it doesn't logically make sense, but in my state of desperation, I tried to fix it by staying with him. I told myself if I could learn to love him, I would be with the man I lost my virginity to forever. I needed to try to alter my horrifying reality in some way, I guess. 

His rage and physical abuse was very scary, but it was nothing compared to the sexual abuse. I lived in a constant state of hypervigilence, constantly dreading what he was going to make me do next. And he was insatiable. He could have sex five times a day, everyday, and I'd still wake up to him jerking off in bed next to me every night. 

He forced me to role play that I was being raped one time, which is fine as a sex game if it's something both partners are into - but I didn't have a choice, and he kept screaming at me for not being convincing enough. He berated me and insulted me and hit me until I put up a proper struggle... Because he really was raping me by that point. 

I had a scar on my hand for years and years because of one instance. He decided one night that his kink was going to be pretending to spy on me masturbating to porn... But I had to do it with my pants up - just unbuttoned and unzipped, like I'm trying to be discrete. But then, to my horror, the porn he put on that I was supposed to be watching... was kids. I, of course, protested to this and tried to get up, but he wouldn't let me. So I stayed there, closed my eyes, and tried to do what he wanted. He made me touch myself for hours, and the zipper on my pants started to cut open the skin on the back of my hand. Even when it was bleeding he didn't let me stop... I remember fighting back tears because it hurt so bad. That left a mark for a long time.

I could tell countless stories about Scott but I need to get to why he's in prison. It doesn't have anything to do with me.

After I finally was able to get away from this monster, he went on to follow his dreams. He always wanted to be a police officer and even admitted that it was to abuse his power, but that never came to fruition. Instead he got a vehicle that looked like that of an undercover cop, he purchased red and blue flashing lights, and a hat that said POLICE on it.

Him and another man cased local fast food places and would follow the female managers after they closed. Once in isolated areas, he pretended to pull them over and would not only rob the deposit they were carrying from work, but rape them at gunpoint. One of the girls had her boyfriend in the car, and Scott forced him out of the car and into his trunk. Then he proceeded to rape the girlfriend inside the car, where the boyfriend could hear everything. He was begging and pleading for Scott to stop. He then made the girl get out of the car and he raped her again in the woods because she didn't have the deposit. 

There were 4 rapes and robberies total, combined with impersonating a police officer... The judge was so disgusted, he gave him the maximum sentence possible. 65 years. He'll be in his 90s if he survives long enough to be released. ",18Feb2019,0

73,"Ever since winter has brought its worst upon us, I never feel like going outside and driving to school. For the past few weeks, I have missed the most school I ever have. Not because I'm sick, but I'm always afraid that in my tired state, I'll end up causing an accident with the uncertainty of the road conditions.
I'm not saying it's what I think is rational, it's more like I can't find the energy to get ready in the morning anymore because of the fact that I'm afraid to drive. Sure, if I got plenty of sleep and woke up on time, then I would probably have more confidence in my ability to drive, but that never fucking happens. 
I know I need to make changes and begin getting my shit together before it's too late, but part of me never knows where to begin, and I always intend on making a plan of action but never follow through with it.

74,"I'm having a down day so imma just vent here instead of holding it all in like I normally do before it inevitably boils over and turns into a full blown 'episode' again. TLDR I've suffered with long term depression for several years but show most of the symptoms of bipolar, as well as having it run in my immediate family. I'm on a waiting list to have a proper assessment but that'll be a while cause the waiting list is huge.
  
It's been very difficult over the winter period to keep up a good routine and it's making me feel like utter garbage. I sleep too much, I stay up late, I don't eat right, I don't go outside unless I have to as well as other stuff. Now I'm a perfectly logical human, I know it's stupid, and know exactly how to fix these things, but my motivation and desire is totally non existent. It feels like it should be such an easy thing to change but I feel so damn low and I am too busy feeling sorry for myself to make the right changes.
  
It honestly makes me feel like a total dickhead cause I'm 'actively' making these choices for myself and instead of doing anything about it I just live with it and it makes me hate myself that much more. It's basically masochism at this point. Doesn't help that I know I am a perfectly capable person. When I'm not in a 'down phase' I get so much done and feel really good and optimistic. It's so exhausting both physically and mentally to feel this low and pathetic.
  

So hard to get the ball rolling and find things to do to occupy myself too. The hobbies I used to love just don't do it for me anymore, and anything I do try just gets boring so quickly. I'm also broke AF so I'm limited as to what I can feasibly do. I used to be so passionate about these things and now I just feel nothing and it sucks harder than words can explain. I also tend to procrastinate a lot which normally results in me doing nothing because I overthink.
  
Not sure what I hoped to accomplish with this thread. I guess I just wanted to feel like I'd aired my frustrations. Lessen the burden even just slightly. If there's anyone out there that has any advice or kind words or whatever it is greatly welcomed and appreciated. Can't get any worse for me right? Maybe one day it'll be better.

75,"I'm extremely thankful for subs like this where you can spill your guts and think that someone might've seen what you wrote. Not that they necessarily care so much about your problems but that they've been a similar experience as you and have similar feelings. I haven't had the ideal college experience and my social life has been shit. I'm sure that experience is not unique in the slightest, though it could be somewhat rare. One of my good friends decided to drop out and the other decided to transfer. So I don't really have anyone to talk to my problems about (hi reddit!) 

Also, I have intimate relationship history so that kinda sucks. It's getting so much harder each year I get older. I met a girl on tinder who was completely out of my league and extremely easy to talk to, but she casually lets me know she's seeing another guy and of course I haven't matched with anyone since I matched with her way early in the month.

76,"I‚Äôve always had a monotonous soft voice. People generally have always made fun of me for how I spoke and it was easy to interrupt me when I‚Äôm talking or ignore me because of my voice. I‚Äôm not sure why, it could be autism for all I know. That coupled with my social awkwardness makes speaking hard for me as I stutter a lot and generally I‚Äôm not a great speaker most of the time. 

Anyway, that much I already know and don‚Äôt care about as I can‚Äôt change it, but today I am calling a startup thing I‚Äôm working with to inquire about something and on the other side were two, a guy and a girl. They answered me politely and we were speaking, but I think the girl forgot the phone was on speaker and said: ‚Äúhow the hell does this guy speak‚Äù in a mocking tone toward the end. 

Ironically enough they only reason it was a phone call is because they didn‚Äôt understand my text, which was in English (we‚Äôre not native English speakers), which was really as simple and understandable as this post.

To be honest, I‚Äôm more disappointed by this level of unprofessionalism than I am affected by her comment. As long as I‚Äôm being paid I really don‚Äôt care what anyway has to say about me as long as it doesn‚Äôt affect me.

Now, I‚Äôm a teenage girl, and trust me I can make the difference between adults that look small/petite, and actual children. And I swear these girls were children. 

I ignored the ad and brushed it off because it‚Äôs a very popular site, and there‚Äôs no way there‚Äôd be an AD for such a thing, like those people should be in some dark corner of the very deep web.

I‚Äôve ignored it, then the ad came up again, and it really grossed me out again - those girls truly didn‚Äôt look older than 9 year olds.

I ignored it again and told myself there could be women with physical conditions that made them look like children - which is probably the case, or simply because I scrolled up very quickly and didn‚Äôt see right, and I was worrying for nothing. 

But lately I‚Äôve been feeling guilty, and I wonder if I shouldn‚Äôt have reported this. I mean, it couldn‚Äôt hurt right? Better safe than sorry.

I gave her the best of me, or at least what I believed was the best of me, but since I never believed I was any good, at some point the worst of me started to reveal itself. That is something I never gave myself the luxury of dealing with, much less anyone else. She is the first person I relaxed and showed myself to. And her leaving reinforced my belief that I'm only as good as my mistakes. My personal problems and struggles, my years of bottled emotions, my all too powerful fear of people leaving me like me mum did, you know, jazz like that.

So, I am not mad at her for leaving, I just really miss her, wishing my best friend would help with all this again, alas, she has her own demons to deal with than having to burden herself with mine. Hell, if she asked for help, I'd put all of mine all of this away to be there for her... but once again, I lump all this hell over my shoulders, like I've done all my life and only now I know that I've been doing so, and continue on forward.

84,"So this is a collection of the worst things that my friend or ex friend now has done. For the sake of privacy we‚Äôll just call him James.

So In the summer James found out that most spas near our high school where secret prostitution rings and if you tipped them enough you could have sex with the masseuses. Now I‚Äôm just assuming these women were victims of sex trafficking but I don‚Äôt know foresure that‚Äôs just an assumption.

So basically how it would work is you would pay for the room upfront 40/hh and then when you got into the room the masseuse will ask you if you want a happy ending and will tell you to tip them another 40 after the massage is done. What James would do was after he got the ‚Äúmassage‚Äù he wouldn‚Äôt pay the $40 and would just leave. James did this multiple times to multiple spas forcing them to hangs their policies. What could they do? They were running a prostitution ring so it‚Äôs not like the parlour could goto the police. James would just say you can‚Äôt do anything I paid for the room already. Now let me tell you that literally nobody supported this. I‚Äôve told this to people that went to prison and even they said it was really fucked up to take advantage of sex workers.

Fast forward a few months my friend let‚Äôs call him Matt comes up to visit me at college with a few other of my friends. I ask him about James and he tells me that he doesn‚Äôt fuck with him anymore. I ask why and he says that James stole $3000 from his parents and said that Matt borrowed $1000 to cover his own ass. So Jame‚Äôs older brother and his friend went over to Matt‚Äôs parents house because keep in mind we‚Äôre all 18. James and his older brother proceed to yell at Matt and threaten him and his family for the money while poor Matt knows nothing of what‚Äôs going on. I cut off James and when he asked why I brought up the story that happened and James told me to my face that the money was his and he never said anything about Matt and that his family just assumed he lent it out because of how much money it was. Later I found out that James admitted to Matt that the reason he blamed him was to buy himself time. Anyways I don‚Äôt fuck with him anymore.

Fast forward a few months later everyone‚Äôs back and buddies again with James and I asked Matt why he would ever forgive him and apparently it was to steal money and shit from him. So I‚Äôm like whatever you do what you do. So one of my best friends we‚Äôll call him Andrew became homeless like a week after he turned 18 but that‚Äôs enough content for a post of its own because it really is a fucking insane story. Basically he lost his job and didn‚Äôt have any money or a place to live and was living in a shelter for other kids who got kicked out of their houses. So my friends wanted to cheer Andrew up like a week after he became homeless so they picked him up (James driving) and went to the mall which is like a 45 minute five or take drive from Andrew‚Äôs shelter. So James really had the nerve to threaten to abandon him at this mall if Andrew didn‚Äôt buy him 4 jr chickens (James fat). Thank god he didn‚Äôt go through with it and people were able to talk him out of it but James still stole Andrew‚Äôs McDonald‚Äôs gift card, literally the only money he had. Keep in mind James is balling if he‚Äôs not driving somewhere he‚Äôs taking an Uber black, he only buys weed 10 or more a gram from dispensaries he just has a lot of money and spends a lot of money. Not sure exact prices but someone once told me he made upwards of 10k in 2 and a half weeks so he didn‚Äôt need that McDonald‚Äôs gift card and certainly didn‚Äôt need it more than my Andrew who was fucking homeless. 

At this point I‚Äôm just like fuck this guy fuck James he did way too much shit and then I found something out that really just topped the cake off for me.

So I live on campus for my university and a few times I had my friends from home come up to visit me. So one day James and Andrew came up to see me on their own (this is well before the 3k thing) and they met my one friend let‚Äôs call him randy. So we spend the whole day together me randy James and Andrew smoking backwoods and shit so James knew randy. Fast forward a couple months later James and a bunch of my other friends come up to see me and we‚Äôre in my room with randy and a few other friends from my university and that was it I didn‚Äôt think anything of it. Randy ends up loosing his speaker that‚Äôs like $300 and I‚Äôm like oh well randy is pretty easy to loose shit so i don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs probably somewhere in his room. A month later one of the friends that came up with James on that day tells me that James stole Randy‚Äôs $300 speaker. I‚Äôm shocked. Not only is that disrespecting me, it‚Äôs disrespecting and stealing from my friend. This is the last straw. And that‚Äôs the story that‚Äôs everything or the worst of everything that James has done to me and other people in the friend group he also drives a car with no insurance which is illegal where we live and parks it at his local mosque because he‚Äôs Muslim which I find pretty ironic

85,"So basically, here is what happened -

&amp;#x200B;

On 02/17/2019 or Sunday around 5pm, I found out the game Metro Exodus was out for Xbox. I originally thought it was for PC only and I remember finding an interest in that game. After buying the game to get the digital code I'm obviously very excited on a Sunday night to play this new game.

&amp;#x200B;

I wait, and wait, and wait.. Nothing. A couple hours go by and I research why its taking so long to get the email for my code. It never takes this long on other sites like cdkey. Finally, I find out that it could take 48 hours to process this. Pretty upset that I won't be able to play this game on the last day of the weekend I search through my Newegg account and find a button that reads, ""Cancel Order"". I know Cdkey will be able to send me this game code at a reasonable time. I didn't want to waste my ending weekend hours on a waiting game so I clicked the Cancel button and it refreshes the page. Confused, I open up the link to my purchase again and notice the button is still showing up on my page like nothing happened. I click the, ""Cancel Ordered"" button once more and it refreshes the page. I figure, its probably already processed and I don't want to confuse the system by placing too many cancel orders. I end up buying the game elsewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

On 02/18/2019 or Today, I get an email with the confirmation code and a thank you. Now I'm pretty upset that I still got the damn code even when I clicked the cancel button. I talk to a live chat guy on Newegg named Brandon. I told him about the situation . You know what he said? I quote, ""I apologize, I wouldn't be able to cancel the order if it was already send to you and digital orders are not eligible for refunds."" This Motherfucker!! I then explained again that I cancelled the order only hours after purchasing this and he told me that orders ""sometimes"" process quickly. Basically, with the system Newegg has, it knows this can happen and can willingly refuse refunds while giving their customers a false sense of security by leaving that button there. There is no reason I shouldn't get my money back! This shady BS needed to be made public. he won't refund me my damn money and I now have an unused Xbox Metro Exodus code and down $60. Please help me with my next steps.

87,"I don't know what i've become, or who even. I think i spent the past few years of my life with this constant feeling of being an imposter, like i'm constantly lying to people around me about who i am. What makes me ""me""? How do i want people to see me? To like me? To be close to me. I don't know if I'm lying to people when i tell them about my interests, i almost have to double check in my head if I'm being genuine or not. I dont want to lie or hide but im afraid that id be too boring, too mainstream, too uninteresting. The few people whom i can call close friends says otherwise but what if i also lied to them? What if my ex was right. What if im this narcististic, egotistic, evil liar who manipulates people? I hurt him by hiding things and not being genuine, i deserve it. Im trying to change and feel like i slowly am but it haunts me sometimes. 
I don't know if people like me anymore, i hurt people in the past and now i feel like i have no one left, maybe i'm just not seeing things well. I'm constantly insecure about the stupidest things, when will i love myself and stop caring if im liked or not? When will i learn how to be kinder and warmer? Some days i wish i just cease to exist for a while, maybe the world would be better off without me.",18Feb2019,6
88,"So, I've known I was gay ever since I was very young &amp; came out when I was 13 (I am now 25). I've always had a thing for straight guys &amp; have hooked up with them over the years. The one thing I can't seem to shake is that I tend to be more sexually/romantically inclined towards them than I do with homosexual men. 

I've already thought of being internally-homophobic or having poor self-esteem issues &amp; to be honest, I'm pretty sure it's both. Being Asian in the LGBT community hasn't presented me with many opportunities with other gay men but I have had wonderful encounters with them in the past.

In the last couple years I've changed my tastes by moving away from older men (who I would exclusively sleep with) to younger guys. The problem I'm finding is that the guys I'm attracted to aren't attracted to me, &amp; the guys who are attracted to me, I'm not really attracted to. This leaves me in a weird limbo state where straight guys will always forever tickle my fancy, but I have my reservations about gay men because we all just seem to be picky in general.

Maybe I am shallow to reject gay guys who I'm not sexually attracted to, but I've learnt my lesson in not trying to force a relationship because I'm finally getting attention. Over the past couple months, I haven't had intercourse with gay men since October &amp; have only made out with an acquaintance because he is still hung up on another guy he's been on &amp; off with for over two years. 

In January, I gave a blowjob to a straight bodybuilder friend &amp; both him &amp; I had a great time. The only thing is that he is also hung up on his ex-girlfriend and is trying to win her back, so I've let that be &amp; haven't pursued another experience out of respect for his emotional state  (also that's messy).

I guess the thing I'm trying to get at is that I am very much attracted to manly men who workout/take care of themselves but when it comes to gay men, I am not attracted to my friends or people I meet at gay bars in the slightest (if &amp; when it happens). I am usually reserved around other gay people &amp; try not to draw too much attention to myself (even though many would consider me an extreme social butterfly). 

Recently, I found out that two of my straight friends who were in a relationship broke up. The first thing I did was slide into my guy friend's DMs on Instagram to let him know that I knew they broke up &amp; that if he ever wanted to hook up with a guy, I'm his man. To my surprise, he said that he would be interested but that was about it. We have known each other since the beginning of high school &amp; never had an issue with me being gay. We would bump into each other on the bus or the gym &amp; he would give me huge hugs while simultaneously rubbing his face into my neck. 

The dynamic between myself &amp; many of my other straight friends is that they already *know* that I would love to hook up with them, so for the most part, they slightly flirt or give me a super bromantic gesture whenever we see each other. As you can tell, my interactions between gay people &amp; straight people are very different &amp; I am more willing to hook up with straight guys than I am gay men. I'm not sure why, I think it's the taboo aspect &amp; that for all my life, I was rejected by a lot of gay men unless they were older. 

I'm not sure how to end this but if anybody has any similar experiences or advice or even questions, I would love to hear from you.

89,"My usual doctor would always tell me if I wanted to wear contacts I would have to get hard lenses that were expensive, as my eyesight is extremely bad. I expected this doctor to tell me the same thing, but instead she tells me that there is no reasons that I shouldn‚Äôt be able to wear contact lenses. 

I was so happy, and my mother cried tears of joy. To some people it may not be a big deal, but for me it was. For years I struggled with self confidence. I got bullied endlessly for having thick glasses and not looking as pretty as the other girls. I remember telling my mother I felt worthless because of this. That‚Äôs why this question was asked again.

I was even happy when I was about to pick out glasses that weren‚Äôt so thick, and get my contact lenses the same day (Not exactly the same prescription but it‚Äôs close, I‚Äôm waiting for my prescriptions). 

I was so looking forward to seeing my friends reaction on Monday. Came Monday, I go to school my first set of friends told me I looked weird, ""As in I couldn‚Äôt recognize you"" type of weird - They said.

Third (She‚Äôs very straightforward) ""Why are your eyes so big? You need to get back your glasses, you look like an anime character..not human.""

90,"I love my dad and I admire how he can keep himself so cool under pressure.  I've lived 21 years dodging tons of drama but it seems like my dad always stumbles into one or two ridiculous situations.  This is a story my dad told me and my family one day about a crazy encounter with a crazy driver that reminded me how incredibly proud I was of my dad.

One day, my dad was driving through a part of our town.  I don't remember what he said he was doing or where he was going, but he was going a very moderate speed.  He then encounters a car that's driving ahead of him at around 30 miles under the freaking speed limit.  Where I'm from, you can get into serious trouble for driving too slow on roads because it can cause serious problems like wrecks or back up traffic.  My dad does the logical thing and goes around the car and apparently the person driving the car got ticked off at this.  They suddenly sped up and tried to get around my dad as fast as they could using maneuvers that were not safe for the road.  Eventually, my dad and that car pulled over.  I don't remember why they pulled over, but I think it was because either my dad or the person in the other car needed to know what the heck was going on.  They were pulled over on the side of a lane, which is kind of important.  

My dad gets out to confront the person in the other car, who turns out to be a much shorter woman.  The woman stormed up to him and started yelling at him ENTIRELY IN SPANISH.  My dad actually knows quite a bit of spanish, but since the lady was talking so fast, he was only able to pick up a few of the words she was saying.  These words were names...names that are completely offensive to people in the US.  

This was when the story got awesome.

My dad decides at that moment to heavily scold the woman, telling her that her language and name calling are unacceptable and what you DON'T SAY to someone who lives in America all in Spanish.  He was also yelling at her about how she was acting entirely nuts on the road and had no right to say any of this to him.  Almost the second he started arguing in spanish, the woman's demeanor suddenly did a 180.  She went from angry and loud to utterly dumbfounded and silent almost as if she didn't expect this man she randomly met to do this.  From what my dad had told me and my family, she probably didn't expect my dad to have known Spanish or to translate any of the words she was spouting at him and instantly realized her mistake when my dad started talking.  

Around that time, a police officer pulled over.  This wasn't uncommon since the area Dad was driving in was very close to the heart of a small town and was usually patrolled by an officer or two.  Seeing two cars stopped on the side of a road and two people standing outside of them talking to each other would make any officer stop to help because you never know if there was a wreck or problem someone needed help with.  

The officer pulled over and asked ""is everything okay, sir?""

My dad faced the officer and said ""yes, we were just talking and I'm about to leave.""

The woman said nothing and just left as fast as she could.  Both my dad and her went their separate ways after that.

Dad explained to us how the lady's car's license plate was from somewhere in Mexico (I don't remember where he said) and I got a few ideas of why that had probably happened.  My guess was that the lady was either visiting or traveling through America straight from Mexico.  If she lived in America, she would have had a state license plate and since our town is small, we would have seen her before.  We also live in a border state, so it wasn't unrealistic to see someone traveling in from Mexico by car.  It also got me thinking that this lady in particular either didn't expect to meet someone who knew Spanish or even worse, didn't think that people in America knew how to speak Spanish.   
 I really hope it wasn't the latter because it shouldn't be impossible for people to assume in any country that someone somewhere knows how to speak another language.  However, I've learned on Reddit that there are people who lack common sense in some areas (referring to r/entitledparents or r/choosingbeggars).  Maybe she thought that she could get away with some of the words she said in spanish because she thought the random man she met wouldn't understand and would try to accomodate in some way because he didn't understand her.  Unfortunately for her...she met my dad.  It also made me wonder if she hadn't encountered a spanish-speaking American before my dad.

My problem is that I feel like I should feel lonely. I've barely spent any time with my friends. I'm always between work, learning Japanese, trying to relax after work and occasionally playing games online. My weekends are always focused on resting properly if I don't get any shifts then.

I'm so exhausted, but I can't let myself stop working 5-7 days a week. Recently got promoted, as well, which drains me even more. I feel like I'm overdoing things, and that I should live more in the present, and not always in the near future. ",18Feb2019,1
94,"My mom passed away when I was 18. I‚Äôm now 30, so it‚Äôs been many years since I‚Äôve heard this story, but as stated in the title, my friend, who  underwent a c section, reminded me of this crazy event. 

It was 1987, my mom was heading to the hospital to deliver my sister. I was still swimming around in my dads balls at the time. I‚Äôve always enjoyed swimming. My mom went in labor for a few hours before they started having some issues. They eventually decided to do a c section, and my sister was slightly cut above her eye during the process. It wasn‚Äôt anything too bad, but it was certainly noticeable. 

Randomly, my cousin was also being born in the same hospital, just a few rooms down. After the nurses finished taking care of my sister, they brought her back in for my mom to see her. Immediately my mom knew something was off. The baby they brought to her didn‚Äôt have a cut above her eye. The nurses were confused, but insisted it was my sister.  My mom knew this wasn‚Äôt the case, and eventually they realized they had messed up. The baby they brought to her turned out to be my cousin! They had swapped my sister and my cousin out, and without the cut from the c section, my sister would‚Äôve likely had different parents, different siblings, and a completely different life. 

I‚Äôve only met that cousin once at a family reunion, but we never spoke of it. She may not even be aware of it. I didn‚Äôt like her very much if I‚Äôm being honest..lol

Thankfully, they got it right. If they hadn‚Äôt, I wouldn‚Äôt have my sister or my two little handsome nephews. 

It‚Äôs amazing how the smallest events can change our paths. Something as small as forgetting your car keys in the house, and having to walk back inside could‚Äôve made you just miss that car accident you drove past heading to work.

98,"It was an ordinary day. I had gone to sleep late that day, and I was only half asleep when I saw my phone ring. It was my father, or so it seemed. My asleep part of my brain considered just letting it ring, go back to sleep and check what's up in morning. ""It's probably something stupid"" I thought. Then the awake part of my brain kicked in: ""No one ever calls you at 5 am in the morning, pick it up"". Hesitantly, I answer the phone. 

For what felt like an eternity, but were just few seconds, I hear someone crying and babbling in the background. My heart sank. Something harrowing had happened. I'm terrified. My mother finally speaks:

""Your father! Your father has died!""

Panic. My heart is now pounding hard, my jaw literally dropped. My subconscious understands that something dreadful is happening, but my rational part of the brain can't process what I just heard just yet. I might as well have heard ""The blue mouse is jumping on the moon!"". These words, they didn't make sense when put together in the same sentence.

""But... but... but..."" I utter back. I can feel I have a cold sweat now. My mind is now racing to rationalize what I heard. Surely they must have made a mistake. Perhaps he's unconscious or asleep and they didn't realize it yet? Maybe they just need to take him to the hospital? I had to find out what happened and intervene.

""What happened? Where are you?"" I manage to put together. My mother answers: ""We were walking on the street when he just fell..."" I press her a little more ""What were you doing? Where were you going?"". She babbles and cries and finally hangs up the phone. I realize it's too much for her right now, and figure I should give her some time and call again in while.

I'm sitting on the couch now. I'm physically shaking, I feel incredibly cold. I go grab a robe to put on, and then back to the couch to shake some more, phone in hand, waiting for a few minutes to pass to call gain. My SO sits next to me, with a worried look on her face. We don't speak, I can't utter a single word now, but she understands. 

I've never been in such a state of utter shock in my life. 

Minutes that felt like hours pass and I finally call gain. This time, my sister picks it up. ""Tell me it isn't true"" I tell her. ""It is true goddamnit, it is true!"". I ask her what happened. Apparently, my father had woken up with difficulty breathing that night; he and my mother decided to go to the clinic (by foot), but on the way there, just a few meters from the entrance, my father collapsed (or ""fell"" as my mother put). My mother asked for help, but attempts to resuscitate him failed.

My mind, coming to terms with the idea that it's too late for me to do anything, enters another phase: denial.

""This can't be happening"", ""I can't believe it"", ""This can't be true"" I kept telling my sister again and again. They were now waiting for the forensic team to arrive at the scene, and we agreed that I would call again in a short while for updates.

I went back to sitting on the couch, doing nothing but shaking and waiting for time to pass to call again. My SO is still next to me, but we don't talk. I don't remember whether I uttered a couple ""I can't believe it"" to her, but it's possible.

20 minutes or so pass. My sister, now under the impression that I'm having a hard time believing it, gets the doctor at the scene to call me and explain what happened. There was no pulse when they arrived, I learned; they tried to defibrillate but it was apparently too late.

Still in utter and complete shock, my mind is now processing the fact that I have to drop everything and get the next plane home. I tell my sister that I need to get some sleep so that I can do the trip; my sister is confused (who would want to sleep now?) but agrees. I didn't actually want to sleep, but the trip back to my hometown takes nearly a full day in between trains, buses and a plane; I needed to get some sleep if I wanted to actually make it. I had a duty to get there asap now, I had to get some sleep.

That didn't quite work out.

I figured that even if I was in state of panic and shock, I only needed to spend a few hours tossing and turning in bed until my body eventually gave up and let me sleep. But no such luck. I spent something like 8-9 hours lying in bed with my heart pounding non-stop, eyes wide open, not a single minute of sleep. Eventually I gave up and got up. 

To the shock and grief of what happened now joined the feeling of panic over not being able to make one of the most important trips in my life. I broke down and cried. My SO, I think, understood what I was going through and did her best to console me.

I made up some excuse about not being able to find the right train connections, because I didn't want to admit I was in absolute fucking shambles, and begged my sister to delay the funeral for a day. Luckily, that was possible and she was able to arrange it. The funeral was then to take place the day after tomorrow in the morning, but not a day later. 

Alright. I had a day to get my shit together, plan the trip, pack, and hopefully get some actual sleep.

That night was not significantly better than the one before. I was still in shock, my heart was still pounding non-stop. But by some miracle I was able to get a couple hours of sleep or so in the 8-9 hours that I spent lying in bed that night.

I got up the next morning, got a shower, picked up my things and left. I had a trip to make and by god I was gonna make it, come rain or shine. I pushed it all into the backburner and focused on the task at hand, one step at a time. I was not going to think, just do.

A couple of trains, a plane and a bus later, I made it to my hometown. It was half an hour past midnight. I was tired, but luckily it didn't drain me to death like I thought it would, I suppose I remembered it worse than it actually was. I arrived at the main bus station of the town, a relatively modest place with space for a couple buses or three at a time at the most. The station was closed at this time, so the bus dropped me outside. It was freezing cold. I was woefully unprepared for that weather because I hadn't really packed much in the way of winter clothes.

On the wall next to the bus station I see they have a place for public announcements and obituaries. Sure enough, the obituary of my father is there. I was still holding out hope that this was all a bad dream that I was going to wake up from, but the more time it passed, it seemed, the more it was solidifying. I took a picture of the obituary with my phone for posterity, and then sent it to my SO. ""I'm here, and this is the first thing I see"" I wrote her.

There was nobody to pick me up at the bus station. My sister had made it clear on my way there that I would have to get ""home"" on my own. I spent a few minutes staring at the obituary in silence, shivering from the cold, and then headed home.

When I arrived, my mother and my sister received me. The sadness was palpable, but I think seeing me lifted spirits a little. We were able to talk normally. We discussed bills, mortgage, insurance. There was work to be done to get things in order and I was to stay there for a while to help with what I can. Around 2 am or so, we went to sleep. The funeral would take place early in the morning and we all needed to be in presentable shape.

I can't say that that night was pleasant either. I was slowly assimilating what happened, but still in shock. But to top it all, heating was broken in that flat, and for some reason I found the bed incredibly small and uncomfortable, even though I had slept there before. I couldn't barely get any sleep again.

In between tossing and turning, it occurred to me that perhaps they'll ask me to say some words at the funeral. I'm the son after all. It was roughly 5 am that I picked up the phone and started writing there. I only came up with a couple paragraphs; that night I felt like that was enough, and certainly better than the nothing that I was going with until then, but in retrospect I regret not having the time to prepare a more extensive speech.

I'm not sure whether I managed to get an hour or two of sleep, but the next day I was up at, I believe, 8 am. I took a shower, but with the heating broken and low temperatures outside, suffice to say it wasn't enjoyable; I spent the whole shower shivering pretty badly. Later that week I got a bad cold that I think I got from that experience, but this wasn't important at the time, I had something bigger than me to do.

Shortly after, we left home and headed for the funeral parlour, the last stop before the actual funeral. It would be my last chance to see him. My mother and my sister had spent most of the day there yesterday, so they knew what was in store for me. But I had no idea what was waiting for me or how would I react. All I knew is that I had to go there and see him.

Just as we approach the door, I see my best friend there, who upon hearing the news rushed to get the next bus to get here. We exchange pleasantries, talk briefly about my father. He cracks a joke about how thin I look. I appreciated that he had come, but I wasn't really in the mood to hang out with him at that moment. Fortunately, he understood we needed some space and decided to wait at the door rather than joining us.

We enter the parlour and head for the room where my father was. I slide the door, and there he is, in the middle of the room, resting in a bed made of pine, inside a box of glass, as if he was in exhibition in some sort of macabre museum.

For a moment, I feel numbness. I recognize my father, but none of this is familiar. He looks too pale, the way his hair is combed strikes me as odd, the expression on his face not how I remember him sleeping. But it was my father, and after a brief moment of bewilderment I understood that those little details didn't matter, it didn't change what happened. I broke down and cried. My mother and my sister, now next to me, followed suit.

After a while, we collected ourselves and left the room. We stay in a separate room where the close family, i.e. us, can greet and meet people coming to pay their respects, mostly extended family, friends and neighbours. A few familiar faces that I can't quite put names to show up, and we exchange the same conversation over and over again. ""It was so sudden, he was so young, no one saw it coming..."". I quickly became numb to that conversation, enough that I was able to have it without thinking about what it meant in detail.

Of all the people I met while being there, my brother-in-law's mother stood out. I had never meet her before, but a short conversation quickly revealed that she had a beautiful, inquisitive mind, asking all sorts of questions and trying to understand my line of work and my life. A sort of curiosity that I rarely see in people. I would later learn that she was 70, which left me very impressed; such a lively mind I would have thought to be 50 or 60 at the most. It did go to show that different people can age very differently.

Some more time passed and the people running the funeral parlour gestured that it was time for one last goodbye. The coffin was to be closed and moved to church for the ceremony. The glass is removed, and my mother and my sister rush to hug him and kiss him. But I can't do it. Something doesn't feel right about it. Perhaps I just wasn't ready to say goodbye. Perhaps hugging him there and then felt like an admission that I wasn't ready to make.

My sister makes a remark about how cold he is. My mother keeps saying ""I won't see him again! I won't see him again!"" as they close the lid on the coffin. Then, just as they carry the coffin away, my sister starts breathing rapidly and uncontrollably. She was having a panic attack. I hold her tight, try to talk to her to calm her down, and then together with my mother we go back to the visits room. My mother is not in a state to console anybody, but in the visits room my brother-in-law's mother sees the situation and is able to talk to my sister and eventually bring her back to earth.

We spend a short time collecting ourselves and then leave the funeral parlour. My brother-in-law would drive us to the local church, where, as per christian catholic traditions, a small ceremony would be held before the actual burial. I didn't, again, have a clue what was expecting me next, all I knew was that I had to do it.

We arrive at the entrance of the church. I barely step out of the car when the first person approaches me to give their condolences. I don't remember who he was, but an avalanche of people follows him, taking turns. Some faces are vaguely familiar from my childhood, others I just can't tell. Some people would tell me who they are straightaway (""You probably don't remember me but I'm your grandfather's brother's daughter...""), others preferred to guilt me by asking whether I remember them, to which the answer was always an apologetic no. I learn that I have a lot more relatives in my extended family than I ever knew I did.

Three people stand out. One is a friend of my father that studied together with him. He tells me he's writing a book where he used pictures of my father when he was young. Another is a distant cousin who appears to be about my age. She tells me the last time she saw me I was nine. The third is a priest, a friend and confidant of my father from his later years; I had met him before, and despite his grave demeanour he had struck me as a kind soul.

I make a mental note that I should get in touch with them some other time, and then slowly step into the church as I continue receiving people giving me their condolences. I have by now lost sight completely of my mother and my sister, but I can only hope that people are giving their condolences to them as well.

I keep meeting and greeting people inside the church. The coffin and the priests are ready, but they wait for us. The priests are not annoyed or restless because we are taking our time, on the contrary, their faces ooze with kindness and understanding. They look like they've done this before, but in a good way, as if they are glad to be of service again.

The avalanche of people finally ends, and I rush to who looks like the main priest to ask whether I could say a few words before the ceremony ends. He takes my hand, smiles at me, and with a look of infinite kindness in his eyes, he tells me: ""Of course. I will let you know when"". I think, at that moment, he could feel my distress, and his gracious composure was his way of non-verbally consoling me.

I collect myself and walk to the front row, where the family is to sit, together with my mother, sister, uncle, my brother-in-law and his mother. I'm shivering pretty badly, this place is even colder than being outside, and my clothes haven't gotten any better since I arrived. But I've got to soldier on.

The ceremony starts. Several priests take turns reading passages of the bible that I've already heard before. And I'm not really listening to most of it.

My family has never been particularly religious; we are christian catholic in paper, but actual visits to the church are reserved for weddings, funerals and little else. I can only imagine that my row is paying as close attention to the ceremony as I am.

One of the priests goes off-script a couple times and catches my attention in doing so. First, he makes a note about how some people believe there's nothing after death, but the belief in the love of Jesus gives him personally more comfort. It becomes evident to me at that point that it's been a very long time since I last attended church, because the fact that he acknowledges AND doesn't chastise a diametrically opposing belief to that of the church comes across as enormously surprising to me.

Later in the ceremony, he goes off on a tangent about the purpose of life. About how we all need to find a purpose, a reason of being, something that drives us and inspires us every day. I've always felt this pretty strongly; finding your purpose is not always  easy, and I don't know that I have found mine yet, but too many people just float in life, directionless and unaware, a recipe that, I think, leads almost guaranteed to depression. Life is something that you seek proactively, not something that happens to you, and I think that at least some people would be happier and less depressed if they understood this. Not that I'm a particularly happy person, but it's something I believe.

The ceremony goes on. At some point one of the priests takes a chalice and, prononuncing a few words, drinks wine from it. I've always found this tradition mildly amusing. Drinking wine in the middle of all this seems to me so inappropiate as to border the comical.

I don't feel like I'm saying goodbye to my father. It feels more like I'm attending A funeral, but not HIS funeral. I don't think I had enough time to process it yet.

After a few more bibble passages, the priests finally calls my name. ""The son would now like to say a few words"". My sister looks at me in total bewilderment as I step out of the row and head for the podium. I hadn't told my mother or my sister, or anyone for that matter. In part because there was no time, but I also figured I might as well try and give them a little surprise.

I reach the podium and take out my phone where I had written my eulogy. And I realize then I should have written more. This is so not enough to express everything that I feel towards my father.

I stand a few seconds in silence, just looking at everyone sitting in front of me, but not really looking at anyone in particular. And then, I begin reading. ""My father was a very selfless person..."". I don't usually have a problem with public speaking, but I'm a nervious wreck right now. I make the wrong pauses, read commas that weren't there. I feel like I'm not doing a very good job at it, but I keep going regardless.

I finish, put my phone back in my pocket, and proceed to leave the podium. Silence. I keep it cool and go about my way, but for a couple seconds it feels like I've blown it. After a pause that feels to me longer than it probably is to everyone else, people finally start clapping, first the priests, then everyone else. I'm a little relieved, though I can't shake the feeling that I didn't do a good job.

I join my family back at the front row. We don't speak. I can't really read whether they liked it or not at that moment. Regardless, there's no time to ponder that; it's the end of the ceremony and the coffin is now being carried towards the door; the family is expected to walk behind.

As we walk towards the entrance, I can feel eyes staring at me, but I can only look down on the floor. I catch a brief glimpse of my best friend, with his eyes closed. I can tell that he's trying his best to look solemn, but I can also tell he is failing. It's kind of endearing. I would have smiled, but the smile didn't come to me then.

We reach the main door, and the coffin is loaded into a hearse. The cemetery is far away from the church, we have to drive for the actual burial. As I stand there, just outside the church, someone approaches me. The face rings a distant bell; I think he knew my father, but I don't really recall who he is. Without missing a beat, he tells me that my speech ""dignified and elevated the entire ceremony"". I thank him, and before I have time to process that, my distant cousin that I had just met before approaches me. My words ""were very sweet and very beautiful"" she tells me. A few other people follow to compliment on my eulogy. I'm grateful, but I still think I botched it and could have done better.

I regroup with my family and we head back to the car. ""Thank you, for what you said"" my mother tells me. I ask my sister whether she thought what I did was ok. ""But of course"" she says ""I just didn't know you were gonna do it"".

My brother-in-law drives us to the cemetery, closely following the hearse. On the way there, my brother-in-law's mother, also in the car, comments on how she thought my words were very loving. I thank her as well, but my opinion remains unchanged, I could have done better.

We arrive at the cemetery. It's family only now, plus a few people from the funeral parlour, some others from the insurance company covering the funeral, and a few cemetery workers. Someone from the funeral parlour hands me some sort of a ""guest book"", where visits apparently signed. I glance at it briefly; it's pages and pages of signatures I don't recognize, from people I probably don't know. I wonder for a moment whether my father even knew that so many people thought of him.

We head for the spot where my father is to be ""buried"". It's not your typical movie burial, where the coffin is lowered in a hole and buried underground. There are giant walls with recesses in them where the coffins go, sealed with inscriptions that act as tomb stones. My father has a particular recess in a particular wall designated. The coffin is being carried that way by means of some sort of a stand with wheels.

We reach the spot. The recess is high up, so cemetery workers make use of something that looks like a forklift to get the coffin in place. My mother, my sister and me watch as the coffin is being lifted. We cry and hug. I'm still not sure whether I'm processing this fully. I don't think I am.

The coffin is pushed into its spot, and the recess is finally closed with concrete. The cemetery workers leave, but I notice there's no inscription in place, it's just an empty, anonymous closed recess. I ask someone from the insurance company about it, who tells me the inscription is ordered and will arrive in about a month. I feel a little uneasy about this, but my mother and my sister reassure me that it's normal.

With the ""burial"" now done, we head for the exit. My mother wants to find the resting place of my grandfather, also in this cemetery, while the insurance person wants her to sign something before he leaves. My sister follows along. My brother-in-law and his mother are already outside. For a moment, I'm left alone with my uncle, my mother's brother. I ask him how is he holding up. To my surprise, he's incredibly chatty, something which he had never been to me while my father was alive. I wonder whether my eulogy left an impression on him. But it's probably just that he was used to chitchat with my father, and with him gone someone has to pick up the slack, so to speak.

Be that as it may, I learn a lot about his life, his work, his afflictions. We leave cemetery and decide to walk back home, so we part ways with my brother-in-law and his mother, who leave by car. The conversation with my uncle goes on and on. We talk about smoking. My father was in good shape and very active, but smoking was his one weakness. A smoker since his teen years, he smoked constantly and obsessively. He understood it was bad for him, but never had the willpower to quit. He would often comment that quitting smoking is the one thing in life that he cannot do. We are not certain of the cause of death at this point, but smoking seemed like a prime suspect to me. 

My uncle reassures me that he knows just how bad smoking is and how these days he's smoking less and less. A heavy smoker as well, as he talks my uncle comes across as a ""do as I say not as I do"" kind of person. I listen to him and nod, but I don't truly believe that he understands the fire he's playing with. Regardless, I don't think it's my place to lecture someone on health right now.

We decide to pay a visit to my grandmother (my father's mother) on the way back, who regrettably could not assist the funeral because she's in a wheelchair after having suffered a heart attack earlier in the month. She's 99 years old, and the incident gave us all, including my father, a big scare. Luckily, she's also the strongest woman on earth: she recovered fully, much to the disbelief of her doctors who told us to prepare for the worst. Her mobility is now limited, but otherwise she's doing well.

My grandmother took the news with sorrow, but thankfully it didn't trigger another health scare. Coming right out of a heart attack, we didn't know how she would react; we were understandably worried. My mother and my sister, with the help of the staff of the nursing home where she resides, had shared the news while I was on my way. Although shocked, shaken and sorrowful, she took it in stride. By now, she knew the funeral had taken place.

We arrive at her nursing home. My mother and my uncle make a couple remarks about being tired and decide to head home; it would me just me and my sister doing the visit. We enter the residence.

The receptionist greets us, gives us her condolences and ask us how we are holding up. She knew my grandmother and had heard. The whole building, in fact, knew my grandmother, and I think it would not be a stretch to say that half the town knew her as well. But for good reasons, mind you: she simply has an incredibly rich social life. I wish I was half as social as she is; I would probably lead a happier life.

We leave the receptionist and head for the room where my grandma is waiting for us. My sister wants to take the lift, even though it's just literally one flight of stairs. I berate her, but eventually comply.

We arrive at the women's room, where my grandma is sitting, watching tv, or pretending to. I go in first, by my sister's request. My grandma sees me, smiles, and extends her arms towards me. ""Come here, gosh darn it!"". We hug. My sister behind me hugs her as well. She seems to be in good spirits, considering the circumstances.

""I heard about you said in there"". My grandma wastes no time in telling me. Of course she's heard, what can she not hear?

I learn that people apparently liked it and clapped a lot. ""I thought you would do something like that"" she tells me. I get the feeling that she's glad that I did it. In my mind I still think I could have done better.

We chat for a bit. My grandma brings up my father's younger years. I learn that my father had a nervous breakdown in his twenties and had to be medicated. We never talked much about that period of his life when he was alive. I wish I pressed more, but perhaps he just didn't want to talk about it.

After a while, my grandma is called in for lunch, and we say our goodbyes. My sister reassures her that we'll be back in a day or two. She's means it: my sister is very attached to my grandmother, and would gladly visit every day if she could.

On our way out, we take the lift again. I berate her again, but begrudgingly comply. We see the receptionist again and talk for a bit. I learn that she's lost both her parents to cancer, is an only child, and never married or had children. She explains how the nursing home gives her a sense of community and belonging that she couldn't find elsewhere. She comes accross as a lovely, genuine person to me. 

I ponder where my community and my sense of belonging is in my life. And I don't like that I can't come up with an answer for that.

We leave the residence. I tell my sister that I liked the receptionist. ""You like everyone!"" she fires back at me. I laugh. I wouldn't categorize it like that, but I guess I do have taken a liking to getting to know people.

We walk back home, and buy some take away food on the way there by my mother's request on WhatsApp. I don't remember what we talked about on the way there, but before long, we arrive home. I eat something, not because I want to, but because I understand the human body needs food to work. I suspect my mother and my sister have the same opinion on food as well, but we don't mention it. We talk about day to day things and pretend it's a normal day, to the extent that we can.

I stay up a few more hours to discuss our ""agenda"" for the next few days, then finally hit the bed, hopeful to catch up on the lost sleep from these past few days.

It's been a tough day, but I made it.

The next few days are a bit of a blur. We make a few visits to the bank, a few calls. We review bills and make some bank transfers. Secretly, I'm struggling to understand how I was cracking jokes with my father over the phone one day, only for him to be gone for eternity the next one. Death is so stupidly permanent, so final. It makes no sense that something so impactful could happen so quickly.

But I don't show any of it. My mother and my sister need me strong.

A few more days pass and we are notified that the results of the autopsy are ready. The medics that attempted resuscitation had ordered an autopsy because the cause of death was unclear. Heart attack was suspected, but I couldn't make peace with that explanation. Both me and my sister were adamant that we had to find out what happened.

We show up at the courthouse, where the autopsy results are to be released to the family. Some back and forth with the employees of that place later, we finally get the piece of paper. There, I see mentions to arrhythmia, apnea, bronchitis and cardiac insufficiency. But what can I make of it? I can google all these things and get a picture of what they mean individually, but I couldn't make out the real cause for the sudden passing. I'm not a doctor, and neither are the people at the courthouse. We leave the building, a bit deflated. I keep mulling this over.

Later that day I share the news to my SO over the phone. We've been talking almost every day, and I've basically poured my heart out about everything. She understands how distressed I am, and how important this is to me. 

I mention how I've seen the name of a doctor in a medication prescription for my father at home and how I was thinking of getting in touch. My SO thinks I should absolutely do it.

Early next morning, I call the clinic where my father used to go, and the appointment was set: I would see the family doctor midday today. I was determined to get to the bottom of this.

A few errands back and forth later, and the time for the appointment came. I grab some documentation and the autopsy results and head for the clinic. My sister and my mother decide not to accompany me; my father, recall, had collapsed on the way to that very same clinic. They cannot bear going back there again.

I enter the clinic and ask a nurse passing by how to get to the doctor I was looking for. She tells me I can head straight to his room, second room on the left up the stairs. I thank her. I don't mention it out loud, but I'm really surprised how casual this clinic is; I don't have to check in at reception or wait an ungodly amount of time in a waiting room. Not that any of this would have deterred me today, but still.

I get to his room. I'm hesistant to enter, since I see he's busy with something, but he sees me and signals to take a chair, to which I oblige. He explains he's just finishing some prescriptions and will be with me in a moment. I sit there in silence while he types away at his computer.

I look around, but nothing in his room really stands out, and I'm not sure if that's because it's a very average clinic room, or because I'm not really paying enough attention for anything to stand out to me at that moment.

We get talking. This man wastes no time with his words; he's kind and gentle, while simultaneously talking like he's in the worst rush of his life. I have to concentrate, but I can follow him.

""Your father was dealing with recurrent chronic bronchitis"" he explains, ""and I never managed to get him to quit smoking"". He speaks with an air of ownership, as if getting him to quit smoking was a personal challenge of his that he never quite cracked. Of course, I knew no doctor in the world would have gotten him to quit smoking.

I show him the autopsy results and we discuss what it means for a bit. Apparently, the constant smoking coupled with the chronic bronchitis exerted too much pressure on his heart, which eventually gave out. It was not a heart attack, nor a stroke, nor some sort of undetected cancer, but simply a weak heart pushed over the brink.

I'm having a hard time accepting this diagnosis, because it seems so arbitrary for someone in his 60s to have an organ fail like that. I press a little further and ask about a possible undetected heart attack, but he reassures me the forensic team would have noticed a black area on his heart if that had been the case. They would have seen it, and it would have been reported in the autopsy results.

I left the clinic still a bit perplexed, but also with the impression that there was no other way around the diagnosis. I had to make peace with it. Smoking had taken my father, I just didn't know it could take him like this.

**Closing words**

I was not the best son a father could have. I was lousy in school, distracted, selfish, and careless at home, and moved out without a second thought the moment the opportunity came. My father supported me through all of that, rooted for me, and never asked for anything in return. He was always there for me when I needed him without fail; which was often, because I was a lousy kid and teenager.

He was the best father a son could have.

And although for the past decade we lived a few countries apart, and sometimes we would not speak in months, and even though he was not without his faults, I loved my father very much. He was very dear to me, in a way that I can't explain; we had a bond, a connection that transcended family. We enjoyed spending time together. I believe he felt the same way. 

Going through his pictures over the years, I noticed that he often appears sad, except in pictures taken when I visited, where he looks radiant. This broke my heart a little. Was my father depressed because he missed me? He never confided in me this much; my father grew up at a time where men where supposed to ""toughen up"" and ""deal with it"", so he never really talked about how he felt or what he wanted. I would often ask him whether he thought about taking up a hobby (he retired early), but he would always dismiss the notion, ""I'm fine really"" he would say, ""I have enough to do at home"".

It's been nearly four weeks now, as of the time of this writing. Family and friends tell me ""You have to move on, your father would have liked to see you live a happy and fulfilling life"". And I think to myself ""Yeah? You know what else my father would have liked? To not freaking die"". I feel like this injustice, this wrong in the world has happened, and I cannot right it, I cannot save him. I feel powerless. Something terrible happened to my father, and I'm supposed to just shrug my shoulders and carry on as if nothing happened. 

It's painful. It's hard to accept, it's hard to make peace with it.

But life carries on, whether you want it or not.

I'm not sure that time will heal it. For the most part, I think I have done a good job in not falling into a spiral of depression; I have resumed my life, my job, the things I did and the things I wanted to do before my father passed. But there's this thought on the back of my mind. One moment I having a good time with someone, only to come back crashing down when my mind reminds me of what happened. I can often feel a knot in my stomach form when the thought returns.

I wish I had been a better son. I wish I had spent more time with my father, I wish I had confided more of my life in him. I wish I could do something better to honor his life. I can only hope to live a life that would have made him proud. But I really do wish I could do more for him.

I love you dad. Thank you, for being in my life, for everything you've done. I'm so sorry that you had to leave us so early.",18Feb2019,58
99,"I haven't had this much longing for another person in years.


I felt incredibly independent for a long time, and was chasing my dreams every day, traveling the world, having relationships but not obsessing over any one person. Then one day you came along and I was immediately infatuated. You say all the right things, you have all the right dreams and ambitions, you are beautiful, but you don't have enough time. And you're leaving. To be someone to you is ecstasy, because I understand the potential you have, and the great experiences we could have. To be no one to you is agony for the same reasons. And to be in limbo between those is...


You didn't have enough time to see me, and it's understandable but disappointing. You left the country - you had to go home. I felt like no one. You invited me to see you a few months from now in your faraway home. I wonder if you were being polite. I hope you weren't. I really hope you weren't.


And in the meantime, she longs for me. And she's here right now. And she makes it desperately clear that she wants me, even though I never wanted her.

100," I seek to warn the House of Lords, Ladies, nobles and those of historic and religious understanding and faith, of continuing deception and cause for further concern in not only the peace of this land and it‚Äôs people and neighbours but furthermore problems inherent in the very rationale and procedures being adopted right now in order to combat the very problems that are now coming to the surface.

Despite many attempts to seek aid and draw light on the issues I am facing I can only beseech you to understand the depth of the problem we all face and our mutual enemy. This is no longer about myself and the violation of my own rights and freedoms or any conceived personal gain. My case should sound alarms to anyone who can hear.

I am a second generation British born 37 year old Bengali woman. I am affectively being tortured like many targeted individuals across the globe but I am hoping that my particular and peculiar case may have already been noted. Investigations in my case have been initiated but I fear that corruption will find a way to silence any progress. 

Like many targeted individuals my diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia affectively silences my complaints but the factual evidence I have bears witness to truth.

The company Apple can attest that my iPhone has been for some time been under a type of sophisticated surveillance and hacking that they have told me had not been seen before. Real time surveillance monitoring, that has now been under continuous investigation by Apple since I reported the problem in late November by their senior tech engineers. They also seek to resolve this problem and I can provide all case number details if necessary.

Foreign governments and corporate and private entities have been subjecting many people across the globe to military grade torture weapons and programs.

More concerning is the guise of technology and perceived mental health problems hiding a very real religious and spiritual war. And the systematic covering up of past and present abuses.

I would like to stand witness not against anyone in particular in a criminal or civil capacity but in order to fight against the erosion of the natural god given rights and freedoms we all have and speak up against growing tyranny and deception in whatever capacity I am able. 

The factors in my case are extensive, I will try to be as brief as possible. I can provide all documentations and reference numbers if necessary.

I am certain that throughout my life after being used in a data study named AESOP concerning atiomolgy and ethnicity study of first episode psychosis in the south east maudsley group and perhaps even earlier I was placed on some sort of research group as a data subject. I was not told of this neither do I remember giving any consent. I further believe other members of my family are also unwitting data subjects.  

The veterans association in Texas is currently processing my request for all my records who has told me as my request refers to claim file within their records management centre it is being handled according to the privacy act. 

I believe that I have been used in many covert longitudinal data harvesting research that has been physically, mentally and emotionally violating and worsening over the years. 

Another twist in my case is that I again unwittingly attracted the attention of other types of groups following my vocal protestations in 2014 on Facebook against Israel‚Äôs treatment of Palestinians. Facebook I believe and have some evidence for is an organisation that is a real concern regarding certain foreign espionage practices.

I and my family was subjected to an onslaught of what is a widely reported problem of direct energy weapons and subversive torture accumulating to my losing the care of my two children and home and relationship. Being forced into a mental health supported accommodation and further more entered in to more rigorous experimental covert practices which involved exposure to varying purities of crack cocaine sometimes mixed with dubious substances and economic testing and being approached by what was clearly undercover or blackmailed drug dealing gangs with a mind to promote prostitution. Two separate groups confided to me they had been approached by a Russian or Eastern European lady to give me certain drugs.

After trying to report some sort of embezzlement by entities within my local council of Redbridge and mental health and nhs foundation trust nelft in regards to receiving funds and grants for services that they did not provide and charging for duplicate services and council tax at mental health exempt accomadations, and links to research data harvesting groups in the US I was attacked severely with a direct energy weapon just before Christmas which as shown by X-ray has resulted in a sediment forming around the bones of my feet. 

There is evidence from my severely hacked laptop and phone that I have been subject to surveillance from other foreign entities including one with a Far Eastern script. All my communications have been hacked and I am being further isolated and silenced. Paperwork and documents stolen from my flat. My birth certificate has signs of being doctored. Many other worrying factors con

I believe much resources and time was also used to fashion me Manchurian candidate style into what I can only describe as some sort of seer used by various occult and spiritual groups. 

Only by the grace of god have I been able to discern the experiences in the light of my own belief and faith in God and have hallelujah alhamdullillah become quite a dissenting voice to some of the deceiving narratives that tries to distort these spiritual experiences. 

I have come to accept my position but refuse to support deception in any form for personal gain and the alluring promises of illumination. After little choice at a normal life at late my chief concern is a duty to speak of what I have learnt only through the grace of god. A reminder of what came before, glad tidings to those that believe and warning of gods punishment to those that pervert gods word and laws. 

God gave me reason as well as free will as hard as they have tried to corrupt and fashion it. There are things I feel is my duty to relay. There is much perversion in the law and violation of people‚Äôs rights and freedoms and I would like to stand and do my duty as anyone in my position would like to do and explain what I believe has been revealed to me and many before me. What ever becomes of me, is in the one lords hands. I can fear no one but god himself. I am a non violent individual and have already been subjected to detention in hospital after making complaints until it became clear that my illness is seperate to the facts of the matter.
