0,"I felt happiness and normalcy after a couple of years of depression. The moment came when I felt united with the people in my class during the spring semester and I felt like I was having fun, I could be myself. It didn't last, though. But that moment made me realize what it was that I wanted. 

I have 2 friends. I had them for about six years. Both are a little mean and toxic, they have positive qualities but I am easy to pick on and I always allowed myself to be put down. After that spring semester, I've been defending myself and lately, pushing them away. I feel a little guilty because one of them only has me as a friend...but I have been getting turned off by them more and more. I don't know if I'm being oversensitive at times or if they deserve it, all I know is I'm getting tired of those types of interactions so I'm starting to let them go little by little. 

They were there for me during some hard times by listening to me and making me socialize, but I realize I want a better support system. They are not empathetic people. A lot of times they push my buttons on purpose, I could hurt them by pushing their buttons but I choose not to and yet they do it to me...They are not stable people. Of course, they have their own problems but I feel sometimes they project or let out their frustration at me.

I want to hold down a friendship with good and stable people. But I know I'm not stable enough myself. I try to change and improve myself all the time but I keep failing. Every time I get up and decide it's a new day, it will be different. But I only manage to change for one day, then I fall back into my old habits. Then I get more depressed because I keep sliding back into the pit no matter how many times I try to claw myself out.

1,"I tried to ask my mom to get me one so I could try to feel more comfortable with myself. It didn’t go so hot though. I tried explaining to her that many people use them for different reasons and it seemed as though she wouldn’t want to listen. She acts as though I’m going to get comfortable with my chest (without binding) eventually but I haven’t. It’s only gotten worse. I’ve been secretly bonding with sport bras but want an official working binder that would improve what I want. 
She said that all it’s doing is masking the problem. I tried getting a point across by asking why she wears makeup and she snorted and said she was done with the conversation. Makeup boosts a lot of people’s confidence up. A chest binder would boost mine. So I don’t understand why she can’t let me actually feel comfortable with myself for once.

I told her that me getting a chest binder would improve a lot with my confidence and she asked in a way that annoyed me somewhat. 

“So your just going to wear one for the rest of your life?”

And you know what? I think I would because it’d pretty much be a replacement of a bra and be that fill in. I know the appropriate amount of time to wear one and how to clean one. 

I plan to ask my aunt and uncle since I feel their more accepting of what I think then my mom. I feel like my mom is the only one (along with my dad’s dad) that wouldn’t approve of me having a binder. I feel caged in a way that makes me feel like I’m slowly losing it. 

I remember my dad once saying that he would be fine if I liked girls (I’m asexual tho) because I’m still his daughter. This was brung  up because I want to wear a suit when I’m in my senior year of prom (I’m going to be a freshman when school starts) and my mom highly disagreed with me doing that. 

Thank you for those who read my issue and problem. I just needed to get all of this off my chest since it’s so frustrating that my mom seems to dislike my approach on how I’d feel more comfortable in life.",12Jul2019,5
2,"The wealthy in America and Canada just so happen to be majority white, I understand that. But that isnt due to some secret caucasian organization. 

Imagine it like a video game. When europeans first came to the americas, they came with some wealth, so lets say they start level 1. 

Time passes. Africans are brought over as slaves. Thats a minus 5, and the current level ones level up 5 levels. 

Slavery is abolished. It isn't like it was abolished and the levels were updated to make it fair. Level 5 is now level 10. -5 is at a -2. 

Time passes.  More immigrants come. Some come with +5 some come with +1. The settlements level up as more and more people come. They are sitting at +15 now. -2 has become 3, and the scattered inbetween.

Now, we have the same level imbalance, where the original groups have fragmented, but a handful still have their original levels passed down from generation to generation. 

It wasn't because they were white, its because they kept the wealth and social levels of their ancestors. 

Now the lower levels are catching up, or having opportunities to catch up, some having caught up and sit as equals, most haven't. The high ranked players want to stay high ranked, and because they've control over the map they dictate who goes where.

So that hillbillies whose ancestors ran a shitty store and never leveled is level 1 still, and he's sitting there looking at the ghetto calling them all sorts of racist things, and the ghetto looks back and hurls insults back. These two level ones go at it, while the level 50+ continues to grow, and continue to encourage the lower levels to fight. 

This is probably hard to follow, I will admit that I am incredibly high. But the point is it isn't white people trying to keep other races down. It's rich people who so happen to be white keeping the less rich down and distracted. 

They look at the black people and white people of lower classes as the same subhumans, who will never reach them, who will always strive but always fail because the game is done and there isn't much you can do to have a chance.

We are in a late game MMO. You can grind all you want, we are all still all one hit kills. Phones have showed us this - the wealthy have a get out of jail free card, the impoverished get harassed. The consequences they've set doesn't hold qeight against them. They can literally just offer you a 1/10th of their xp for you to forget and you'd be a madman to refuse, regardless of what they've done. 

Its late stage MMOs, and are all being played. There isn't a white vrs everyone else, save for a handful of uneducated idiots who don't represent the vast majority. And everyone who disagrees is just playing into it.",12Jul2019,9
3,"This is my first post and it's long. Sorry, but thank you for any help you can give me. 

I've been with my wife for 18 yrs, married for 13 of them. We have 3 kids, a nice house, and careers. For the last year she has been battling depression and anxiety. We have dealt with it in the past but she was able to work through it with little to no medication using me, our kids, and her desire to prove she could do it. This time it's different. 

Some backstory, at 17 her parents split and basically abandoned her. She lived in their rental house until all the utilities were shut off. She moved in with friends who turned out to be a lot less than that. Finally moving into my grandparents and into my parents home. She was very depressed but getting out of high school and into college seemed to give her a reason to continue with life. We moved into our own place the summer after we graduated and have lived a fairly good life. 

We had our first child and she had some post pardom depression. Some meds we couldn't afford later she was back to living life. This happened after each child but would get better as the child aged and she got back into normal life. 

Fast forward to last May when her mom died. The months leading up to it included her mother's husband passing away (not her father), a few challenges at her job that she didn't take well, and or kids not doing nearly as well as they should in school. She noticed her mood dip so she sought help in August. She was on meds for months and never told me. She was seeing a therapist and a counselor and never told me. She was contemplating suicide before Christmas, during the holidays and after. They changed meds and she saw her dr's more. Nothing seemed to help. 

In March of this year she told me about the suicide plans. I learned about her battles in the months prior. I learned about some of her plans. I learned that she was giving up. This resulted in a visit to the ER and a 2 week stay in the hospital. During her start she had her meds increased and she had 8 treatments of ECT. The treatments seemed to help but the memory loss and cognitive damage became her concern. She wan't herself and felt like we made a mistake in taking the treatment. It may have saved her life but it destroyed her future. The side effects have gotten better but she still is not able to remember things like she used to. And as a type ""A"" person with almost photographic memory, that is a major problem. 

She was good for a bit after coming home. But trying to go back to work made the memory issues that much more prevalent. She fell back into her depression and suicidal thoughts, which put her in the hospital again. Her FML has ran out, she only has a few weeks of vacation left and doesn't feel better yet. 

This brings me to today. After a 2 week vacation that went really well she stopped taking her meds, accidentally at first but then in an attempt to get more bold in her suicide attempt. She spen't the entire day today in the hospital. She was admitted to a behavioral health ward and is for the most part has given up again. 

So im here asking the internet what do I do? I'm spent. I refuse to give up but don't know what to do. I'm not ready to close this chapter in my life and need advice on what I can do for not only her but also for myself. My kids weigh heavy on my mind as they don't understand the severity of the situation. They really don't know what is happening because we have not really told them the details. How do I move forward? What do I do? What worked for others that I can try for us?",12Jul2019,3

8,"I’m finally allowed to see him again legally, after 20 months with only snuck in text convos. His parents are horrendous. It was awful. As was their inept and selfish parenting and his home life. We spent as much time as I could possibly pull off together until his insane and abusive dad decided to use that as another way to get to him, and my sister and the rest of the family. The details are pages of heartbreak. 
Anyway. He is so amazing! 14 now, Sweet and funny and smart, bumbling but always trying! More empathetic than a lot of grownups I’ve met and I just love him to smithereens. 
One of the last things that I said to him, because I knew what was probably coming, was “I will always be here for you no matter what... all you have to do is say the word, and it doesn’t matter if we don’t get to speak again until you’re a grown-up I’ll be waiting and I love you every day. “
I have been no contact with my sister because of her alcoholism among a lot of other things. But he is with her for the weekend and wants to see me, so of course I’ll go. 
I want to make him comfortable and I want to just spend a good day with him. No drama, no pressure. 
Can anyone help me with whether or not I should try to talk to him, find out how his home life is? How do I make the best of this opportunity and just love him?
I do not want to get dragged in to my sisters shit (I’m worried she might be using the opportunity to get me to talk to her)!

It is really different from my main language and I am learning english for 3 months. I have learnt Russian instead of English in high school and it was mistake. 

There is nothing in the world that interests me. I like nothing anymore. When I was in high school, I had dreams. I was a hardworking student, I was really good at math and science, I always wanted to become scientist. Now I'm 2nd grade medicine student and it disgusts me. I hate studying for medicine, hate memorization stupid muscle names, and hate anything about medicine. I can't understand that why I studied hard in high school. I have national mathematics olympiad silver medal and now I am spending my life to memorize every stupid useless things in medicine like anatomical names, biological cycles etc. There are a lot of smart people who is good at science like me in my country and they want to become doctors. I guess it's same for other countries. I can't understand them. I can't understant why a smart person who capable math and sciene wants to spend his life as a doctor. It is loss for mankind. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway. I am going to leave medicine and change my career for math/physics or engineering but I don't want to do anything anymore. I have lost my motivation. I lost my religion. I don't know what changed me in two or three years but I am quite different person. I have become hopeless, lazzy, depressive person. I have no dream, no purpose.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't find reason to live. I am atheist for 3 years. After my father's death, it was 6 years ago, it made me more religious but then I started to hate god. Now I don't belive in god. I don't believe in an afterlife. I don't care about human life. I don't know what motivates these people to live. There is no difference between human beings and animals. Death and pain for people don't make me sad anymore. It is same for me. The absence of afterlife makes me want to kill myself.

Also if there is a god, I really hate him. He never answers my prayers but always punishes me for my mistakes. The presence of god makes me want to commit all sins in the bible. I don't want to go to his hell or heaven. I just want to die and want everything same before I was born.

12,"Key: ∆: indicates important topics being talked about in this post.

 I use the term ""western"" to describe how (for the most part) the initiation process of relationships works in America. I use America because, this is where I was raised, and I am not sure how it works in other countries, or if the initiation process of a relationship even changes in other countries.

Warning: I am biased, and I am human. This post is likely to offend people. Keep in mind I am doing my best to speak of ideas openly, lovingly, and as nonjudgmentally as I can. 

∆ 

Before getting offended about the title think about the initiation process of a relationship, or the psychological process of starting a relationship, because, (drum roll) it is complete bullshit (in my obvious opinion).

 Let me tell you why, and of course, please disagree if this is not true to you, as I would love to hear multiple standpoints as to what I will be talking about. 

∆

An intro to the intro may help you innerstand where I am coming from. I may have pent up feelings about women not innerstanding my intentions. I am a nice guy, and I feel that it is okay if I approach women seeking a sexual relationship and it ending up to be just a friendship. In fact, I would idolize that situation to happen! The fact is, that even from trying to make new friends and even with the same gender, I feel that people are scared or just not very open-minded. 

Then again, if someone confronts me with the intention of making a friendship, and I find I don't want to be a friend with that person because I feel they may not be true to who I am and that I don't ""vibe"" with them, where the absolute fuck does that put me? Is this all a crazed mind game that only I am suffering from (the latter being a complete joke (insert laugh here) ). 

∆ 

So, the initiation process of a relationship is bull shit. 

* Why do men ""have"" to ask a ""women"" out? 

* Why don't women ask men out? 

Yes, perhaps women ask men out, but in reality, 1.) it rarely happens and 2.) if it does happen it likely would have stigma behind it because it is not common, and if something is not common, our human bias is to think that it is bad.

∆ 

Let's also talk about lesbian and gay relationships. Personally, I think the initiation of a relationship in this kind of relationship is possibly freer and this idea is liberating! 

I think that there is no stereotyped role (from the outside) in how one may act in this situation. Let's just say, for example, there are no heterosexuals who stereotype the LGBTQ community, in which case I wish was true, but many people cannot move past the conservative ideologies. The way I think it works out is whoever finds someone interesting, sexually attractive, or simply just wants to get to know that person more, they just initiate the relationship and proceed to build on it however they want without having to worry about the bullshit ""ROLES"" that most heterosexual relationships ""play."" 

∆ 

(Mini tangent)

The ""perfect female"" and the ""perfect male"" idea has got to stop. And personally, I feel that the porn industry does a disgustingly great job at portraying how a sexual relationship should function creating stereotypes of the ""perfect male,"" and the perfect ""female,"" and I am sure the ""perfect lesbian/gay,"" the ""perfect transgender, "" and all of the other ""perfect gender(s)"" that exist. 

Another disgusting thing about porn is that it merely focuses on penetration, and then branches off into more disgusting subcategories, and darker and darker. Sex is nothing close to about ""penetration"" it is about the sexual connection that two or more people share and the feelings which go beyond language. 

The metaphysical, the spiritual, and the divine aspects in which beings share together in a moment or series of connections is what building a sexual relationship is about.

 ∆ 

Where does the bullshit come in within the initiation of a relationship for a friendship relationship in western society? 

What I think is bullshit is when one (being male) starts talking to women, for example, at a cafe, genuinely just trying to be nice and making small talk or trying to dig deeper in a conversation, is assumed to be trying to ""get"" with women. What is a similar thought is when a male compliments a female just being nice, it is assumed that they are flirting. 

∆

Lastly, what is bullshit, are stereotyped in which a woman or male may think that she or he has to play for the role of a relationship. 

For some reason, I think that the stereotype that females in western society have to suffer from is the idea of being the domestic partner in a relationship. As well as being scared of men in general. Because men are evil? No, because maybe, many men are possibly porn induced sex craved people who can't think above the belt. I am tired of seeing men drool over ""tits"" and ""ass"" and ""pussy"" and will literally ogle women for too long it makes me feel uncomfortable (and I am male). And seeing grown men do this all of the time, and watching men ogle my mom continuously throughout the store without her even realising... That makes me sick, and I would hope, realizing that eventually (preferably tomorrow) through evolution this is something that will be of the past. For these reasons, it is right for women to be scared of men. It is sickening, sadistic, and sad.

Maybe this is all just biological bull shit that I have learned about humanity. Maybe it is the lack of females realising their animus, and the lack of males innerstanding the anima within them. Maybe it is all because many humans are not as in touch with their true self that I would prefer them to be. He's it sounds like I am making some generalisations, and maybe, I am. Does this make any sense to anyone else? Is this worth getting worked up about? I would love to know. Thank you all for taking the time to read what matters to me. Much love to all!",12Jul2019,1

14,"I'm a 20 year old guy. She started off on YouTube but is now a moderately successful singer/songwriter. I started watching her videos way back in probably 2013: original songs, covers and what I guess would be considered vlogs. I first found her when her videos had maybe a few tens of thousands of views and now her songs are getting tens of millions of streams on Spotify. It's pretty cool I feel like I watch all of that change happen.

Anyway maybe this is me being crazy but she gets really personal in some of her videos and songs and especially in her autobiography that I just finished reading and I feel like in a lot of ways (obviously aside from the being famous part) our lives have been similar. I've been through a lot of shit with mental illness and sometimes it's shocking how similar her accounts of some things are to what I've experienced. Sometimes if I feel like I can't find the words to explain what I'm feeling, she's already done it. Just lately she's been almost the only music I listen to. 

It feels like I legitimately have a crush on this person. It feels like through some shared experiences she doesn't even obviously know about that we have some kind of connection or solidarity. And since I don't know anyone else irl who knows her or her music it feels like it's kind of my own personal thing. 

I know it's creepy and everyone says it about their favorite celebrities but I genuinely feel like we could be friends. I have a ticket to see her in concert for the first time this coming fall but I feel like I'm gonna have weird feelings about it. I literally feel the same way about her as I've felt about irl crushes I've had. I'm not gonna be the crazy fan to try to run on stage and have to get tackled but still.

16,"hello reddit im on here all the time. im writing this because i feel like a lot of people use reddit as an outlet and i feel comfortable. Its like metaphorically screaming into a void except  I know people are listening.

Something just hit me. just a big wave of emotion and distress and writing helps me process it more... First it was reflecting on my current relationship. But now I’m realizing its a deep rooted self problem that Ive repressed for so long and didn’t want to confront or address it ever. ever ever ever... One thing turned into another and i caught myself literally exposing so many facets of myself to someone I barely know yet... Then it occurred to me to make this.


For so long. for most of the parts i remember of my life I had to be the strong one. I had to be strong for my mother. for my sister. And now i have to be strong for my friends around me that are lacking in emotional maturity and need a strong figure to lean on when things feel like theyre falling apart. In my current relationship I have to be level headed and strong and take a lot of stuff. I am just so so afraid of crying now or breaking down or purging my emotions in the ways I used to because it feels like I’ll get criticized. regarded as being too sensitive or like it’ll just appear like I’m  freaking out. I can’t pinpoint how i’m feeling exactly but with the self awareness I have I just feel so. damn. empty. For so long. Today i was with my close girlfriend and I couldn’t concentrate really. or articulate things super fluidly. Like my brain stops working sometimes midsentence (i think these are symptoms of adhd and ive been diagnosed.)  But like mostly I was very engaged and responsive but inside I just kinda felt like a soul steering my vessel of a body and not really there. I was very aware of my body and how it felt and how it felt to just be present and all that and not exactly dissociating but like. just some part of me wanted to not be there. Or anywhere. Not with my boyfriend lately who i feel super strongly about and want to spend the rest of my life with. (or so i think...)  In that aspect I feel kind of dead though. I don’t feel emotionally there when I am around him. but typically I am full of affection and love and warmth and It is just in my nature to love and connect in really expressive ways that I know how. and in ways that I know is his love language too. and I still do that on the outside but on the inside I literally feel dead i cant. pinpoint it..... before my period we had sex and Physical affection is my  strongest love language  above all things and I love sex with him to feel connected loving closeness. but it felt so empty and after i always felt so bad. I didnt enjoy it. I wasnt really there. I want to be present but i drifted away.  And i really love sex so it was surprising to me and blindsided me so i think thats why I felt like crying all the time. I just want to feel strong emotions again. in good ways. I am so sad because there are so few people in my life- close to Nobody- that i can share how I am feeling with. Because i am scared. I dont want my strong, composed, level headed facade to crack. I dont want to look weak to my friends or my love. I am scared of being  vulnerable. In ways I am super vulnerable and show my heart on my sleeve but I cant say that i am hurting right now. I cant tell anyone i donr want to tell people Im close to that i need help. i “graduated” therapy and am welcome to come back but i dont want therapy as I feeel I can manage my emotions very very well. And i am going to be loving and delicate with myself through this. But damn I am hurting. and i hate feeling like i dont know where its coming from and that.I dont know what is happening to me.

I dont want to be strong or brave or courageous and composed and appear happy and be a mediator. I want to break down. I dont want to share this with my boyfriend but I will. I dont want to share this with my friends but I will. I just feel  nothing. I dont feel happy peaceful emotions very intensely, I dont feel considered and important and cared for. even though i know i am. But i want to be babied . i dont want people to tell me its ok because i know it will be and i DONT want someone to take care of me and nurse me to health and happiness again I just. Want to feel like i really matter to my loved ones. 

I am so afraid to admit im hurting. I dont want to overwhelm anyone. I dont want to be told im freaking out and life isnt that bad and i just need to calm down and breathe and be myself I just. want my loved ones to tell me i matter at least. I dont know what is happening to me. I have felt not completely present in my interactions with people in person and ive felt like that for a long time. I dont feel attentive.. Like i literally feel like a shell and some part of me is leaving and i cant discover it anymore. I want something to happen to make me remember how i feel about my boyfriend and my other friends. I feel like i want to run away. or vanish. or not be here. I dont know. I dont feel suicidal and theres no intent behind any of my thoughts but . wow. I dont want to be alone with myself but there is no more emotional energy to be with people atm and I want to be the one that people are expressive of their love towards. I want my loving energy towards other people to come to me.

21,"So, I’m not going to candy coat things, my life is shit and I’ve felt like shit for a long time, but I’ve been lying to myself that my life is pretty good for a long time. That good old fashion “I have food and a roof over my head plus some” argument. I’m mostly writing this to really get myself to stop lying. This is going to take a while so buckle up for a long read. Firstly, I was home schooled so I never had a social life as a kid other than one person who liked across the street from me (but he moved away when I was like 10). The fact is that I have never been especially close to anyone in my entire life (I’m 19 now), which leads into my other problem about the fact that I don’t have anyone a feel like I can talk about my problems with (don’t want to trouble my family with it) so I just keep everything to myself. I’ve seen/heard about people being active and go to parties and such but I honestly though that it was more of a cliche then a reality until I stated going to college and heard more people talk about it. I always told myself that I’d make close friends eventually or that my life hasn’t really started yet which for the most part is true. I don’t have a life, I don’t know what I want and I spend everyday just trying to find things to keep me entertained until the next day rolls around and I almost never do anything productive leaving me with an unsatisfied feeling every day. I do not live a healthy life and I feel like shit all the time because of it. It’s gotten so bad that one of my doctors (yes I have more then one we’ll get to that) has recommend I see a nutritionist because I don’t eat healthy. Now let’s get on to the rest of the reasons my life sucks. 
1. I have both autism and ADHD which makes functioning as a normal person a concerted effort everyday.
2. I can’t focus on one source of sound so whenever there is more then one noise at any time they merge together making it incredibly hard to hear anything most of the time and makes crowds unbearable.
3. I’m prone to dehydration and have to drink about 8 water bottles worth of water a day or my blood pressure drops and I’ll almost feint whenever I try to stand up. 
4. My eye sight is horrible and I’m basically blind without glasses.
5. I have a super strong sense of smell to the point where it become a really inconvenience. 
6. I had sever scoliosis (back was bent 50 degrees) and had to have major corrective surgery so now I have two metal rods in my back that I can feel at all times and it isn’t pleasant. I suffer constant soreness and stiffness in my back and have to do physical therapy everyday.
7. I’m constantly suffering from insomnia to the point where even with sleeping aids I’m lucky to get 5 hours of sleep. 
8. I have malformed feet (ankles roll inward and only on foot is flat while the other has a slight arch) which causes excruciating pain after standing for more then about 10 minutes making it a near impossibility for me to get any sort of part time job. It’s bad enough that I have to wear corrective shoe inserts designed for extreme foot problems (these things are solid plastic) and they still only help slightly (without them my feet hurt as soon as I stand up). It’s continuing to worsen meaning I’m going to have to get foot surgery in not too long. 

About a week ago I decided that I was going to work towards fixing my life. Im going to try and go out of my way to make some friends, eat healthier, and generally be more productive but that still only helps a little bit and for now I still feel like shit. Sorry for complaining so much, I tend to try my best not to complain but I really wanted to get things off my chest for once.",12Jul2019,3
22,"So my dad has a habit of being an ass tbh. He has a short temper and any amount of stress makes him snap. I (17 M) dont really have enough positive memories with him and he's very uninvolved with my life so in just starting to distance myself from him the best I can. 

My sister (9) has shown a talent in music and she went to a piano lesson with my mom today and actually enjoyed it. So my mom came home late and told me and my dad about the lesson and how my sister really liked it. Then when she mentioned how the teacher said we need to buy a new, better piano (we have a shitty, cheap one) so my sister can build up her skill my dad flipped. He started saying how we are absolutely never getting a piano and how this is just terrible. He was just saying ""no"" like a literal child and having a mini tantrum. I went to the other room and just listened to him yell about it for 5 mins and being disgusting. I got more in more pissed as he was refusing to even consider it (we wont need it for a couple months anyway) and kept talking over my mom. At one point in his tantrum he mentioned how my sister doesn't need some more ""keys on a board"" and that she should basically deal with what we got. Then after another minute of him being a child I got too pissed, ran into the room, got in between him and my mom and told him something along the lines of ""dad stop, calm down and stick your whatever up your ass. It's a fucking piano, it's not a big deal and you need to tone down your attitude. You are acting like a literal child, where do you think (my sister) is getting her attitude from"".

Gonna be honest, it felt good to let it out. I've never sworn at my parents but fuck he deserved it. My mom didn't even get mad, you could tell she was thinking the same thing and just kinda told me nicely to not get involved. Haven't spoken to him after that yet but I heard the fight escalate more to where my mom was getting angry too. I'm so glad my sister was asleep, she shouldn't be exposed to that. Honestly, rn I want my dad to just take a very long walk and come back an actual man and not whatever he is right now because holy shit he was acting terrible.",12Jul2019,3

27,"We've had Jupiter since I was 8, and she was an amazing cat. I don't live with my parents anymore, and haven't for several years, but she never forgot me. Just last week, during a visit home, she ran up to me and didn't want to stop nuzzling me.

This cat was such a boss bitch and I adored her to no end. She made sure she got everything she wanted, but was incredibly affectionate and clearly loved us. I actually thought for a while she would be just too stubborn to die since nothing was the boss of her.

Tonight, my mom called me and told me she was in total organ failure. She was surrounded by my whole family until the very end, but I couldn't be there. And my fiance is out of town, so I have no one here to comfort me. I have a bad habit of burying my feelings, so I'm trying not to, but I'm devastated.

I can't seem to be interested in how their day is going, that their kid is giving them shit at home , like I try to be interested but I seem to shut off any form of mental interest in this person and I know they feel that...

29,"I know this post probably belongs on r/iamverybadass but fair enough, I don't care. I believe that I have the potential to be the very best at everything I do, and believe anything that I dedicate my time to I have 100% potential to succeed. I improve at the things I'm passionate about due to the fact that I obsess over them. As a result, I do believe I am destined to one day be among the greatest fighters the earth has ever known. But that day is not today. I believe that you can speak and believe things and if you put the effort into making those things happen, they will. But only if that task which you put your mind to is what you want to do. I believe being such a capable martial artist is what I'm supposed to do, because I don't have anything else.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even have role models, I have favorite fights, stuff like that, but there's no one I want to be like. The only thing I have is myself to make me happy and I can only do that, I only WANT to do that by being the toughest person on the planet. And right now I am not but one day I will be.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents have enough money that if I applied myself in school, I could succeed and go to a college of my choice. But this is not what I want to do. I don't want to work some office job, don't want to be a lawyer, don't want to be a fireman. I don't want that type of job. The only thing I care about is making myself be as tough as I think I can be. I want the person I am 20 years from now to be the person my 8-year-old self wanted to be. And that was some kind of a martial artist so effective they cannot be beaten.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always been interested in martial arts even before I realized. I was a huge superhero fan and still am and to this day I am not fascinated in the brutish warriors that can steamroll anyone, my first favorite superhero was Spider-Man because he used his superhuman abilities in conjunction with his creativity to defeat people like Rhino, venom, and the sandman that are significantly more powerful than him. And this is much the same way I see martial arts, and I am inspired to be like my favorite superheroes in this sense. I don't believe you need to be the strongest to succeed, but you need to be strong enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't believe you need to be the most skilled to win but you need to be skillful enough, and like Spider-Man I believe I will always be capable of getting either strong enough or skilled enough to beat an opponent. I am fast but not super fast, strong but not super strong, most of my attributes are fairly average yet I still believe I have this in me because my ambitions are all I have. 

&amp;#x200B;

Years ago, summer after freshman year, I was really an asshole. Didn't know I was an asshole, maybe I still am. Everyone wanted to see me get into a fight with someone, so they called up a senior that was affiliated with gangs to come fight me, he wasn't super tough or anything but he had that street mindset. We talked shit back and forth and I fought him, got my ass kicked, but wore it like a badge. Told absolutely every single person that I lost, but I am still the better fighter I just haven't unlocked who I can be.  At this time I was a taekwondo blackbelt, and every now and then I'd buy day passes at a UFC gym and hit heavy bags under the instruction of some MMA fighter that doesn't really give a shit. I guess I just wanted some sort of an outing to let myself be the tough guy I thought I was, and at that time I wasn't. And at this time as we are talking I still am not, but I will be.

&amp;#x200B;

During that fight I realized how important grappling was, and from that point I attended Brazilian jiujitsu open mats once a week at a gym called 10th planet. An open mat is basically where no one teaches anything, you just go out there and train with other people for free. 10th planet is an American chain of Brazilian jiujitsu gyms that teaches jiujitsu with the idea of using flexibility and trickery to neutralize strikes. I never got a membership there, but I trained there and got choked out every day. It taught me a lot. Most importantly it taught me the importance of flexibility, which is very important because although most of my athletic characteristics are above average, my flexibility is godlike to the point where I'm almost a contortionist, and I'm practically immune to injuries.

&amp;#x200B;

I joined my school's wrestling team. For that whole first year, I didn't wrestle one single varsity level match.  But this didn't discourage me. I never got the opportunity to, and never had a true loss at JV, so this was already. There are some people that can just use their athleticism in wrestling and dominate every single person from day one, but I wasn't athletic enough to do this.  Instead I had a very slow but steady journey, where each month I surpassed people that were previously better than me, and I never noticed anyone surpass me. By this time I felt like I conquered the JV level, not terribly impressive but I felt proud and this reassured me that through hard work I achieved what I wanted.

&amp;#x200B;

This last year, I was forced to float between varsity and JV. There's only 1 spot per weight class, and both people in the weight classes I am capable of wrestling at were far better than me. I needed to weight for someone to be injured for me to wrestle at varsity for one of them, and in this year I learned a lot. There were shit talkers that got under my skin, made me want to fight them. There were new people who I knew could never match me that I helped. But I developed an understanding of my body. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of that season I got a membership at a local MMA gym of mine. The coach there was a national champion wrestler, and used to be one of the head coaches at arguably the top MMA gym in the United States, but they group fell out, so he started his own gym. There they have wrestling class twice a week, which is helping benefit me a lot, train with actual professional level athletes in my goal to be the best wrestler I can be. But aside from that they have jiujitsu about 5x a week, and boxing and kickboxing multiple times a week. As well as MMA everyday in the evening. I try to attend all of it as frequently as possibles. The pros there kick my ass but it's what I need if I want to be great one day.

&amp;#x200B;

Before the school year ended I did my first jiujitsu tournament, they didn't have enough teens my weight so they bumped me up to the adult division, and despite the adversity presented I was able to win.

&amp;#x200B;

This is now basically the present. As of now I've trained MMA and all the encompassing styles consistently for about 6 months, wrestled for about 3 years, and inconsistently and unofficially trained 10th planet jiujitsu for 3 years. I've done taekwondo for many years, and my journey will continue.

  
As of now the summer is over in about a month, and that's when the wrestling season starts up. I can wrestle on even footing with a friend of mine from a higher weight class that used to totally destroy me in previous years. One of the people that had my spot in the past is now graduated, and i don't have to worry about him. But I have some adversity I want to overcome. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of my teammates placed 5th in state last year and occupies the weight class I want to be in, he has practical superstrength and is a crazy athlete. I will beat him throughout the year and win state in his weight class because I am training with professional fighters. He isn't. He has to finish the football season. I don't, the instant the school year starts I have wrestling class for first period and go to wrestling practice in the afternoons. These are all big advantages I have, and I will beat him for his spot. I will win state in his spot. I can already put up a fight against him, in 4 months of wrestling with pros and showing up to wrestling at school, I will dominate him.

&amp;#x200B;

Another one of my teammates has never wrestled, but he's about 20 pounds heavier than me right now with like 0 body fat, in season he'd be about 40 pounds heavier. He has D1 level scholarships for football, great athlete. He poses no risk to me or my ability to be a state champion, but I'm mad that I got beat, and I will defeat him. It won't take long, I will be destroying him before the summer is over. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not bragging about my accomplishments because as it stands they're shit. I got beat up by a gang member that didn't know how to fight. I was a JV state champ two years in a row,  and didn't get the opportunity to wrestle in state at varsity because two people better than me had those spots on lock and you bet your ass they didn't let themselves get injured for state week. But this doesn't change how good I am, and how good I can be. 

&amp;#x200B;

This day in history I predict that i will be a state champ. I know it. I will have my first couple mma fights before my senior year is even finished, I know it. Give another 5 years and I'll be ranked in the UFC. I know it. And in another 5 I'll be a champion. I know it.

&amp;#x200B;

And there's nothing that will stop me. Because this is all I have and it's all I want to have, I want to be someone that the person I used to be could look up to. I've never looked up to anyone and thought ""I want to be just like you"". I want to be my own role model. And the only person I look up to today is the person I know I'm gonna be.

&amp;#x200B;

And if you think I sound like an asshole, cool. Maybe I am. Maybe you can kick my ass for now but I don't care. This post isn't for you. This post is for me, I'm foreshadowing the person I one day can be. I have nothing else that I want more than to be this person.",12Jul2019,1

31,"I’m in a situation. I’m 23 years old. I’m getting older and have $0 in savings. I finally am done a stupid gym membership I got wrapped up into, which is why I’m so moneyless now. I have about $600 in my account...$300 of which was from the government those HST payments...so I’m looking good for now...I want to keep it that way, I’m looking to kick my bad habit of eating out all the time. I’ve already made the correct steps in utilizing my free food advantage from my first job which takes 85% of my time. 

I have graduated college from performing arts so I know singing is what I ultimately want to do. I just can’t at the moment, I need the funds and time to start. 

My schedule is so hecktic that I don’t even have time to get a part time job without totally killing my sleep. So here’s my typical week:

Monday: I’m off all day long...usually use this time to recoup and do chores. 
Tuesday to Friday: I work 3PM - 11PM 
Saturday: Work 11AM - 10PM
Sunday: off work again all day.

So I do have two days in which I can utilize for money making tasks. What I’ve had in mind is this: 

If I were to work at say tim hortons and make min wage do 5AM - 12PM then drive an hour to my first job (which I don’t get paid at because it’s a family business just turned 1, I do get tips though but we’re so slow that per week at the moment is $100-$250 depending on a higher week I’ve made $300-$400 those are rare though...) 

So back to my schedule...if I were to work those hours Monday - Thursday 5AM - 12PM then drive an hour to work 2PM - 11PM Then drive an hour home. How doable is this? Can I sustain this for at least a few months? 

What else can I do to make money? Tim hortons is quick and easy to get hired and other things I’m thinking is just grunt work that I don’t have to talk to people just clean or something... I’m desperate at this point and I’m tired of being poor. I plan on investing my money once I get into the thousands and I want to make a living for myself so I don’t have to rely on my family business or anyone anymore. Please help!",12Jul2019,1
32,"I keep reading about, and hearing about, and even working along side people who are barely getting by in life and I'm not sure how I'm doing better than most people because there's nothing particularly special about me. I didn't do particularly well in high school but always felt like I understood the content. I only have high school education as well. My family isn't wealthy in the least and we're been near homeless several times since 2000. 

In 2011 I started at my current factory floor job as an assembler. Fast forward to today I still do pretty much the same job and I have over $100k saved in the bank, 401k, RothIRA, pension. I have a wife, no kids. We take 2 vacations per year plus frequent smaller trips on 3day weekends. I fully paid off 2 newer cars. We have 0 debt. 12 month emergency fund. Have never missed payment for rent/utility/other bill in 4+ years. Saving to buy our first house and pay the a full 20% down payment in cash.

But then I see there's people more motivated and ambitious, smarter and willing to push themselves to the limits and do whatever it takes to get to the next level, and they're barely getting by. 1 paycheck away from ruin. I'm like the laziest and most relaxed person I know, and I have no worry or stress. I see homeless people sometimes and I think of how is it that I'm not homeless, because by all means and logic I should with them as well as I don't really have a marketable skill. 

I should be homeless because there's nothing special about me and I have no skills and basic education. But I'm not. I'm doing fine. WTF",12Jul2019,4
34,"Recently a co-worker's soon killed himself. A few years ago my fraternity brother's sister killed herself. And over a decade ago I almost died of a suicide attempt. 

I think suicide is miss understood a lot. Things I have heard were ""I just can't believe, at such a young age, they didn't think there was more to life for them"", or ""how could they do that to their family? Don't they know how much they were loved?""

It is a daily war to be alive and go through life, and sometimes, it's too much and it's not about anyone else or anything else but not wanting to fight anymore. They aren't thinking about potential happiness in the future, they are thinking about how they have to get up and face the day. They may know they are loved, and for me that's what staved off my attempt. But eventually I needed a break. I was so lucky that my friend noticed some signs and called my parents (relentlessly) to tell them she was worried. I had taken a full prescription of anti anxiety medication, high blood pressure medication, and sleeping medication. I was rushed to the hospital and next thing I know I am in treatment. I was so blessed to be given a break from everyday normal life and work on myself for a year. 

I am now married, have a fulfilling career, and am so happy. I bearly recognize the person I was when I was a teenager, except when there is a funeral of a child who lost the battle. Then I understand it all again. 

For those of you who are tired, I hear you. It's hard af. I know that there are times where it is almost impossible to take a step forward. It's ok. Do what ever you need to to make it through. Sleep, talk to a counselor, make questionable decisions, and BE OK ASKING FOR SND ACCEPTING HELP. I love each and every one of you. You are a fucking warrior. The fights not over yet. What helped me shift perspective is to zoom out on life and realize That I only have one go at life. I need to see it through because it's the only chance I will ever get to experience consciousness and life. Everyone has to reconcile life and bring alive. Find what keeps you going.",12Jul2019,3

36,"A bit of background: This guy is a ***psych*** professor who happens to be filling in for another instructor on maternity leave. His teaching style matches up perfectly with my learning style, and he encourages us to feel safe and open in his classroom.

I disclosed some information about my mental health, as it can sometimes get in the way/ make me seem unattentive or a bit ""off"". He asked me if I wanted to talk about it, so I went on to briefly tell him about my stay in a psych facility and what had played into it. He was very sympathetic at the time and assured me he would keep it in mind. 

Flash forward to today, we were talking about the show Snapped and kind of joking about which one of us would be in future episodes, because that's just our sense of humor. I mentioned guns scare the crap out of me, and I don't trust myself with knives. Before I could even explain why the professor goes, ""why? are you a cutter?"" while miming the action. I laughed in the moment, mainly because it caught me off guard seeing as he is a ***psychology*** professor. I would expect him to be a bit more understanding/considerate to topics like that. 

I guess I'm just wondering if I'm overreacting? Like maybe he said it in the heat of the moment because he was trying to entertain the class? Or is it something that I'm just in being a bit upset about?",12Jul2019,4
37,"So for a lot of backstory(18 years worth), I’m going to try to work chronologically. 

This starts when I was about 12. No I’m not Jesus. When I was a kid (12) I decided I wanted to get a job as a software dev. Even then I was playing around with databases and excel, VB, etc, learning whatever I could. Going to school I started taking up subjects that would teach me how to achieve that but since it was a school they were pretty fuckin awful at it to say the least. I found it boring as hell and when I was 15/16 and I had my work placement to go through, It ended up being the most boring 2 weeks in my life. Still. To this day.

After that, I kinda lost my direction. I stopped going to school and the dream fell apart. Somehow I actually made it through my year 11 but I only attended about 2-3 weeks of yr12 before just saying fuck this and I didn’t go back. Pretty poor life choice, but hey. It’s something I have to live with. Even after that I stayed a pretty solid enthusiast, just in my own way. I built my own PCs and maintained them, did shitloads, probably too much gaming and for a career I chose something about as far away from ‘plan A’ as I could- I became a chef at 18. 

Now, the first year was hard. I mean REALLY hard. Mainly because the vets always ride the new guys but there were some days where I’d finish up my 15 hour Monday, get to my car and just think ‘what the fuck have I done?’

Once I finished my apprenticeship though I floated through a few jobs soaking up knowledge wherever I could. Found a great job in a big cafe near where I grew up (we lived about an hour away by now) and I worked there for a couple of years. During the time I worked there I found out that a girl id been seeing throughout my apprenticeship and for some of the time after had died through heart disease, at 21. 

When we separated we had a really big falling out but I knew through and through that I still loved her. A few weeks before, she contacted me trying to make peace and I cold shouldered her, and there’s always going to be a part of me that thinks she was either trying to reconnect and get that good few days in, or gave up on life when I didn’t answer her message. That question still haunts me today. 

Sorry, back to the place. After that news I developed a bit of a ‘fuck it’ complex. I stopped caring for rules, laws and just generally had a bit of an attitude. A Victorian license has 12 demerit points before you get suspended and I managed to get 14 in a mont. furthermore, I kept driving to and from work every day because I needed the job, I was actually using it to get my head around my life as the girl I was seeing at the time was a sociopath to the core. Manipulation through self harm, lies, you name it, and I needed to think of a way to help her at least be a little normal. 

One day I’m hanging with her on my day off. I get the phone call to go to work because the stoner apprentice hasn’t rocked up yet again. It’s my one day off after a 12 day stretch and before what was probable going to be another 12 day stretch but I go in anyway. On the way home I have a massive accident on the freeway. I told the police and my parents that I was exhausted behind the wheel- which realistically was the truth, just not all of it. I was on my phone. Just browsing Facebook like the idiot I was. Ran up the back of a semi at 110, compacted the whole front end of my car almost to the windscreen. There’s good and bad news to this. The good: I had 2 broken ribs but was otherwise unharmed. The bad: I still had “only” 2 weeks left on my 14 month driving suspension. 

Biggest. Wake up call. Ever. 

So of course I had to go to court where I pleaded guilty with the little lie intact but then went on to explain what I’d been going through and why I was driving when I wasn’t meant to be. I got away with a small fine which I paid on the day and no further suspension. 

What annoyed me about my work through this ordeal, is they acted like I was being so difficult by having to take the remainder of the week (after the accident) off to A, find and move house within walking distance of the job and B, let my fucking broken ribs heal which wouldn’t have been broken if they didn’t call me into work on my day off. And then again acted like I’m the antichrist for the day I had to go into court. I gave them 6 weeks notice that I needed the day off, and they rostered me anyway saying ‘nah sorry can’t do that’, like ok sure, I’ll just skip my court hearing and get arrested like the apprentice you just fired, shall I?!

Needless to say after this my views of the workplace changed dramatically. It showed that even though I’d been there over 2 years and been part of the work family, that to some I was nothing but a number on a page. A page with 23 numbers on it.

One particular Thursday, Head chef started grilling me about something, I can’t remember what now, but it pissed me off and that mood carried to the following morning, when the instant I got in, he pulled me aside and ranted for 15 minutes about the apprentice (that still had a job) and his special, which as I was neither the head nor sous chef, wasn’t even my responsibility. Teach, guide and assist but I’m not their damn supervisor. That’s his job. And that was my last day, HC finished 5 minutes after the rant, I worked the shift and told the chefs that worked the night that I wasn’t coming in the next day. 

The mental and emotional fallout from this 6 month bracket starting from the accident basically ruined me to the point I couldn’t step in another kitchen for 6 months. Fortunately I had some savings. 

But here’s where the real problems come in. 

When I finally did go back to work, I had the problem that I compared every place to the cafe, which despite the falling out that caused my quitting, is still to this day the best place I’ve worked. This basically meant everywhere else sucked. I floated through jobs trying to find one I liked and it never happened again after another 4 years (2018)

The last jobs I had, I worked 2 for a while. I was in a small cafe with a douchebag disrespecting apprentice (whom I was not allowed to fire) from 7-3, from there I went to an Italian restaurant where I worked 330 till 9-930. I’d eventually had enough of the apprentice and resigned from the cafe. I also came down with glandular fever during that last week so I missed the last day (legitimately) and was basically bed ridden for the next 5 weeks. Fortunately, had a girlfriend that helped me through the worst of that. Again, was treated like the antichrist at the Italian place because they still wanted me to be working. Problem was I could barely stand for a minute let alone be on my feet, active in a high pressure environment, and highly communicative when I couldn’t even breathe properly much less talk- for several hours. 

ended up having a massive falling out with the owner, or rather his daughter because she kept putting orders through 30-40 minutes earlier than we were supposed to open. Nothing’s actually ready to go at that point we’re still setting up. But she’s confirming to people that things will be ready well before they should. Without checking with us. 

Now I understand there might not be many chefs on here. But there’s kind of an unwritten code of respect that has to take place in hospitality. Everyone has to work together to get the job done as painlessly as possible. But when people go off key, it ruins all the mojo. Suddenly that setup time is taken with orders and then we’re having to come in earlier to setup earlier so she puts through orders earlier and- when do you draw the line?

Apparently telling the boss that his daughter had no understanding of hospitality didn’t go well. Suddenly found myself with a job, but on the shit list, and I decided that maybe the industry, and myself, needed a change. 

From there, I decided I’d try my hand working in a warehouse. I was still fairly young at the ripe age of 28, I was a little overweight(am again) but I would lose it really quick if I found a more active job. And I did. The problem there was almost any job you go for- even entry level ones, “require” years of experience. Which I don’t understand. Entry level role- require experience. If there was a tip-scale with those on either side which one goes up?

So I ended up spending a few months out of work and went through what little savings I had for my ex and her kids because she always wanted to go out, and since places weren’t calling me back I got to the point I was literally paying for fuel with coins. Eventually the depression of being stuck was getting to me and it rubbed off on her and the kids. I wasn’t violent or anything. Just a bit short fused. Definitely could have handled things better. Needless to say she didn’t wanna stick around with me being depressed. So there’s me, moving out of her place with 0 money, 0 home and at the time, 0 job, absolutely stuck between a career I refused to return to and the one I was prospecting. I couldn’t move back home because my old room was something else entirely now. And I couldn’t get a place because I had no job or money. 

I contacted a friend that owned a place with her partner at the time and a friend of theirs. They usually had a room free so I asked to stay for a bit, with the understanding I was in between work. It was fine. I found something a few weeks later in warehousing but the hours were awful. 1-2 shifts per week was barely enough to keep me fed and fueled, let alone pay the rent, much less the rent I was already owing. Over the next year I kept trying to find more jobs within the field to keep the bills paid but every time I went for one, the one I was in stopped giving me hours. I know it’s not me as I’m a hard worker. The agencies here simply want to be your number 1 even though you’re far from theirs. If you get another job for more hours they don’t wanna compete for your time so they just cut you out and replace. 

And here we are.

About 3 months ago I decided that this field obviously wasn’t working. They employ casuals every single day but ‘there’s no full time jobs available’ and that’s the only way to get stable work. A new change was needed. 

At 30 my body is starting to suffer a bit from work abuse. I thought I might give IT another look-in. There was an entry level position in an American company that has a dev office here. About 8 weeks ago, I redesigned my cv to be a bit “techy” and sent it in. 

They called the agency for a reference after they started shortlisting candidates and I was axed from the job I was in, because I was looking for work. And I’ve been out of work since then because this company has taken so frickin long to get it together. I literally sent the cv 6 weeks ago, they took 3 to get back to me for a phone interview, another one and a half to organize round two, a face to face with the guy that would be my supervisor and cognitive test, and it has now been a week and a half since then. I did get a small update yesterday that said I am the only candidate remaining but the only question from there is, is the test enough to actually land me the next panel interview, or the position?


But all in all, I’m stressed as shit right now due to the fact I haven’t been working for a few weeks. I’m stir crazy because I can’t go out much as I’ve had 150 bucks to survive me for the last 3 weeks but I am super hopeful to get this gig. It’ll be something stable and I can learn again.

I can see the light at the end of the tunnel, but the ride isn’t over yet...",12Jul2019,2
38,"I am 16-year-old from Texas this past week I was on vacation in the Caribbean the first two days were pretty normal just vacation but the second day I was there I was walking along the beach with no shirt and I noticed three girls looking at me while I walk past I never really thought it to be anything as it’s just the beach but later in the day I saw those three girls again at the pool looking at me and whispering to each other as I walked past them to go towards the beach One of them stops me and the other two walk in the other direction she asked me if I spoke English and I said yes she then explained to me that one of her friends was into me and asked if she could have my Snapchat I said yes and I am with my day . About 20 minutes later I received a Snapchat from her saying her name why she’s here and she said that she was here to celebrate her birthday with her friends and she’s from Brazil and the funny thing is that my birthday is four days after hers.One thing led to another and she asked me if I wanted to meet her at Beach at five I said yes and was extremely nervous and met her there and at night after just a couple minutes talking I was extremely surprised of how much we had in common from the foods we like to have a strict her parents were and the sports we like the TV show we liked and even our irrational fears everything seems so weird that she was so similar to me and we’re so far apart it seems like every answer she gave was the same as I would’ve given even though we live in two totally different cultures . I eventually had to go because I do go eat dinner at my family after I finished eating I Snapchat of her and told her that I enjoy talking to her and that I had a good time the funny thing about that conversation is we’re both so shy that we never even took off our sunglasses while talking anyway that night she snapped chatted me if I can meet tomorrow and I said I was busy so she asked we could meet again later that night I met her again at night and we sat on the beach and we just talked and I was still surprised about how many things we had in common seems like we’re almost same person and yet there for two totally different cultures everything about it was just so similar to me . And again we both had to go as her parents didn’t want to have us out late that night that night again I texted her how was funny how similar we were and I would love to see her again sometime during the trip

She said that she felt the same way and that will meet up again the next morning she asked if I was available that night I said yes and I think about Waze meeting with her and talking to her that night . We finally met that night I was leaving the next day so I was going to make a big explanation and tell her how I felt. That night when we met on the beach I told her how much I enjoyed spending time with her and that she gave me a special feeling and she said the same thing to me and we hugged about 30 seconds later I said how much I enjoyed being here with her and I didn’t wanna leave after that we made it we locked eyes and kissed who is the first kiss for both of us after that we spent the rest of the two hours cuddling and kissing on the beach who would walk around holding hands up and down the beach saying how much we enjoy each other‘s company and how special each of us felt toward the other I told her how I never had a feeling that towards anyone else like her I had crushes on girls and others but she was special she gave me a feeling I never had before towards someone. Everything that night she said from the quotes like how she want to spend the rest of your time with me and how she want to spend more time with me at all of the other even ran closest she said felt like I could’ve said to myself I was thinking almost the same thing eventually after about two hours of cuddling and kissing on the beach we had to go we both said how we Snapchat each other if both of us need anything

I think we both realized that I was living over 5000 miles apart and over on two separate hemispheres of the earth this relationship really just didn’t make sense and this is probably the last time we would see each other

She gave me a feeling that no one else has given me and I’ve never felt before when she was in my arms on the beach I just felt like everything was right everything was in its place and that something a special doesn’t come very often

I left the next morning on a flight and we’s we said our goodbyes how sad we were.

It’s now been a few days since then and I can’t stop thinking that we Snapchat it maybe a few times but I think we both realize that it was just a simple vacation thing if anyone has a previous experience to this or similar experience please let me know I just want to know a way to get this out of my head I cannot stop thinking about it and how much I miss her thanks for reading this really long story if you did. Thankss",12Jul2019,3
39,"When I first saw you come home almost 20 years ago, you melted my heart. You were the greatest friend that a little boy could ever hope for. I had no brothers or sisters, but I had you. You kept me happy, you played with me when nobody else did. You gave me, a 4 year old boy, a million reasons to smile. Even though I was only a child back then, I knew that I loved you more than anything else in the World. 

As the years flew by, things began to change. I graduated preschool, finished elementary school and eventually moved onto high school. You were there every step of the way. You were getting older, and it was beginning to show.

My heart broke when you were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012. The vet said you only had a few months to live. She was wrong. You lived much.... much longer. When I was a child, you taught me love and friendship. Seeing you persevere against cancer, you taught me how to be brave. You taught me how to cope with hardship. You showed me that miracles could happen.

In 2015, you passed away at our home. You were walking around in our backyard and you collapsed. You died on the spot. I wasn't there. I was at school. Mom called me and told me what had happened. I left school early and drove home. I saw you laying there, wrapped in a blanket. I kneeled next to you and started crying as I touched your face. I had never cried like that in a long time. You were buried in our backyard.

Other dogs came into my life after you left. The thing is, your ghost still haunts me. Every time I see my dogs, I'm reminded of you. I play with them the same way I played with you many years ago. I love them so much because you taught me how to love. You taught me how to be kind. Even though you're long gone, I think about you everyday. I love you, Princess. Thank you from the bottom of my heart",12Jul2019,1
40,"Hi. I'm an 18 year old that's fresh out of high school. My aunt told my mom about a job offering that could aid me on 'my' journey towards my career. I took the job offering and here I am, working 12 hours a day at a desk job far from home. I live with my aunt and her boyfriend. It's nice but I think it's just filling a void in me. 

In high school, it wasn't great, but it wasn't bad. I had plenty of wonderful memories in highschool, and-- of course-- bad ones. Sophomore year I instantly fell in love with some cute, quiet girl but never had the courage to talk to her. I've only talked to her about four times, and once through an email. That same year, some other girl fell for me for some odd reason. I asked her out Junior year, and we've been together since. I absolutely adore my current girlfriend. She's helping me regulate myself from time to time. She helped me when I had surgery, she helped me when I was going through some mental hoops, and she's still helping me throughout so much more. Not only is she juggling me in her life, she's also juggling her younger siblings, her college forms (because her mom knows pretty much nothing about the US education system post-high school), and plenty more. I feel as if I don't deserve her, but here she is sticking to me for whatever reason. 

To elaborate on those mental hoops, I've gone through a couple panic attacks and various severe suicidal moments (some of which my brother and girlfriend have witnessed). My mother seems to think that everything in my life is going good, regardless of what I've said to her. She thinks everything is good (I have a job, a loving girlfriend, and I'm heading off to college soon to pursue a career she thinks I like). Everything isn't good though. I hate my job, but it's providing income for me, so I can relieve some of the pressure of my parents working. I love my girlfriend, but I feel as if I'm not deserving of her. I'm majoring in a major that I say that I like, but the only reason why I'm majoring in it is because I'm good at it and I have a secure job position.

I'm not enjoying my life. I've told my mom and my dad that I'm not happy. My mom later mocked me for crying about it a couple hours later. My dad is bad at expressing emotions but I know he has them. I adore him so much and I'm so lucky that I have him as a father. He works so hard to keep our family moving forward so I feel like this job is a way to help ease his stress. My brother has helped me through dark times and I can't be anymore grateful. Although I feel as if it's a one way street, in which I'm sharing myself with him more than he does with me. My girlfriend is probably one of the best things that've ever happened to me, but I take her for granted. I still have feelings for that other girl, although I've had very little interactions with her. In all honesty, I think I'm in love with the idea of being with her, rather than actually being with her. She seems like a lovely person though, and that's something that's gnawing at me. I regret not asking her out, or at least talking to her more. Although I'm happy and enjoy my current girlfriend, I can't help to think about the 'what-if.' 

So, rather than sleep and get a good nights rest in for another 12 hour shift, I'm here lying down on a couch, simping about my life. I want to move on from that girl from highschool, and live a happy life with my current girlfriend, but no matter what I do, I can't seem to find it. I want to help my parents with money, but I can't seem to find a middle ground between my social life and work. I want to get over my mental blockades but the only people offering me support are my brother and my girlfriend, who I can't thank enough. I've told others these problems but I usually get the same responses back. 'What are you sad for?' 'It'll be okay.'

Just because I'm priviledged doesn't mean other problems go away.

And no, it won't be okay. I appreciate your concern though.

43,"I want to start a charity that raises money for services to help those who have suffered social media or viral shame including counseling, monetary support while finding a new job if needed, and other needs for those who have their lives turned upside down for a bad decision. 

This would be for people like the airplane lady who sent the insensitive/racist tweet while flying, the people who call the cops in moronic situations, people going nuts on a plane, basically anyone who achieves the worst level of viral outrage for a reason one could consider forgivable and allow them to take a path to redemption and self betterment. In other cases, this would be a service for those unfairly accused and attacked simply because people don’t know the whole story. 

Is this an asshole idea? Is this a good idea? I hate cancel culture and outrage culture. I think some assholes, morons, insensitive people deserve a chance to live their lives and be better. They shouldn’t have their lives turned into a constant harassment filled hell where they lose their jobs and reputation for mistakes all of us have made a variant of in our lives.

45,"Keep scrolling. Typical depression post to follow, so you won’t be gaining anything from this. It might just make me feel better to vent it out. 


I have plenty to be thankful for. I’m a healthy 23 year old, I have a wife and newborn that make me feel loved, and I have a job that pays the bills-almost. So  to some of you this post may be the equivalent of seeing that kid in school crying because he got a C on his test. Maybe I just expect too much from myself. 

By this time I expected myself to have graduated college like my friends and starting my career as a pilot. From 8-16yo I put thousands of hours into playing Microsoft Flight Simulator. It was my main hobby and I took that shit seriously. It was my dream and I wanted to fly like I wanted to breath. My dad is a pilot like his dad was, so through osmosis, I naturally caught the desire. Until recently it has been an obtainable goal. But, I dropped out of college, and never finished getting my first pilot rating(private). Those thousands of hours have now seemed to gone to waste and so, I feel a huge part of my person has gone to waste leaving me hollow and useless. 

I fucking hate my job. If I’m not traveling I wake up at 4:30am and get back home around 6pm. I dig holes and that’s it. I use 2-3 brain cells to get the job done. About 100+lbs of dirt per hole, 15-20 times per day - doesn’t matter how fucking hot or cold it is. Tons of walking through briars, mud, jumping fences, evading animals from dogs to cattle. $12/hr. But it’s not the worst job, I know. 

I haven’t had any disposable income in... almost a year now. No saving either. I usually work Saturdays too so it’s not like I would be able to do much anyways. On Sunday I don’t want to do anything. 

The one hobby I had was coding. I fucking LOVED it. Computer science was what I went to school for. It challenged and satisfied me. If I cant be a pilot, I’ll be content as a software engineer.. I dropped the only computer I had 10 months ago and that was that. No more. I liked to drop by the software subreddits but it just pisses me off now. 

I can’t afford a computer. I can’t afford flight school. I’ve trapped myself here. Each day goes by quicker and with them my dreams become more unobtainable. 23 is young but I’m starting to feel the time speed up. I know I’m going to blink and it be too late to start anything. 

Hating my job is easy, but hating myself has demanded a different kind of energy. I have nothing else to blame for being where I am - pure laziness. I’ve lost almost all respect for myself. Within my mind is a raging maelstrom of rich fire. It rips and tears at me. It burns away the spirit. Rage and regret hang heavy on my shoulders. My wife sees it and it affects her.  I’m irritable to be around and nothing makes me happy. My coworkers ask if my dog just died. 

I try to shake it off as I dig. I dig a grave for my dreams to go in.",12Jul2019,3
46,"WARNING : RANT ahead. 

I came up with these two lists... Which are both depressing. I don't know if it's normal to feel like this, or if I'm in a really bad place. Good (?) news is that I'm seeing a therapist in a couple of weeks so I get to discuss these because honestly after I read what I'd written it scared me. I would include a picture, so you know I'm not making this list up - I wrote it down on a paper, but my handwriting is crappy. Here are the lists:

***LIST 1 :*** **If I lose weight I'll be...**

1. Happier
2. Have more guys show interest in me
3. prettier
4. More confident
5. able to dress how I want because clothes will look good 
6. able to wear make up because I actually will feel beautiful 
7. able to wear heels because no more chubby foot and balance will be easier
8. able to feel better
9. healthier (It's down on this list...) 
10. able to do physical activity without feeling nauseous  
11. able to do things you've always wanted to do like going to public pools and beaches in the summer, go on trips and not have to constantly be embarrassed of being the fat person in the group, go to acting class and get to play the pretty girl for once and not the funny one
12. able to love yourself more ... or at least look at yourself in the mirror 
13. more successful, because we all know attractive people (and thinner = more attractive in this world) have it easier - especially attractive women! 

***LIST 2 :*** **If I don't lose weight : (in a year)**

1. I'll still be a fat 26 y.o woman 
2. I'll still be a virgin because no guy is attracted to me 
3. I'll be miserable like I still am. No progress, still the same place I've been since I was 18. 
4. I'll hate myself and regret not starting last year 
5. I'll be at risk of diabetes 
6. I'll damage my organs, my bones and my posture even more 
7. It'll become harder and harder to fix myself 
8. I'll hate my graduation photos because I'll be the fat chick in all of them 
9. I won't enjoy my summers 
10. I might get even fatter 

&amp;#x200B;

These are scary to me. I wrote them down without thinking too hard, these just came out. I read them the day after I wrote them down, and I started crying. I never realized how much I dislike myself, and how horrible I am to myself. I'm worried, like officially worried that these are dangerous thought patterns and it won't matter if I start. This isn't just about being overweight, this is actual meanness to myself and dislike. I censored some of the stuff, but there were things like ""you'll still be a loser"" ""you'll be the pathetic fat girl who refuses to be in group photos because she'll stand out"". 

I want this to change, I want people around me to understand that I already hate myself more than they do. That every second of my life is devoted to thinking about this, to seeing and liking pictures of my friends and supermodels on instagram and thinking ""this could have been me"" and hating myself for not being that. I'm sick of feeling guilty over eating pizza, and then continuing to eat it because I feel like there's no hope for me. I'm in my mid 20s, I've never had a boyfriend and I do not take care of myself. Every little thing is a chore for me! Brushing my hair, shaving, getting ready. I do not think about what I wear because in my mind, nothing looks good so why even waste time trying? 

I feel sorry for this girl. The hate, the constant disgust she experiences when she wears clothes that don't fit right or show rolls of fat. The absolute misery she experiences when she goes out with her friends, who are all slim and beautiful and girly and she has to hide behind being a tomboy who doesn't care about fashion/beauty and cracks jokes at the expense of herself before anyone gets the chance to do it even though nobody ever does. (Some do) It's like how in Pitch Perfect, Amy (Patricia!) called herself ""Fat Amy"" so skinny girls wouldn't call her that behind her back. 

Everything in my life is about my weight. Things that have nothing to do with it, like taking an acting class. Everywhere I look there's a reminder: My friends posting workout videos, YouTubers I watch talking about being bloated when they are literally skin and bones, guys paying attention to my skinny friends and ignoring the girl who dresses like a 14 year old boy and doesn't wear make-up, doesn't brush her hair, doesn't pluck her eyebrows, doesn't care. I know that look works for some people, but on me, it looks like I've given up. Which is true. 

I am a nice person, deep down. But living with hate every waking hour of your life tends to take a lot out of you. Nobody in my life knows this. I've successfully created a persona and hide behind it. I'm the blunt funny person who is more interested in nerdy things like computers and school. You see, you don't have to be attractive to do well behind a computer or at school. In fact, the less time you spend socializing and deciding what to wear the more time you have to spend on reddit and watching tv shows. So you end up talking in movie quotes, and awkward around people. You'll end up losing friends, because you're now so used to being inside your own head in the world of Stranger Things and would rather spend time with Steve than with real people. 

This isn't white people problems either. This is taking over my life kind of problem. This is stopping me from living my life, and knowing this isn't helping. I'm smart, I'm self aware, and I've read and watched enough stuff to know how destructive this is and how this must be addressed. Yet, none of that matters. It's second nature to me to think all my problems will be solved if I was just skinny. Everything that is wrong with me, everything I don't do or do do (hehe) is because of my weight. I make comments about me being fat that makes people uncomfortable. I refuse to go to parties and pools because I don't want to be the fattest person there. I spend way too much time worrying about being fat, and not doing anything to change it. 

I don't even know what this post was supposed to accomplish... probably should add in a RANT warning at the top. If you've read it this far, thanks. It's nice to think someone knows how I feel.",12Jul2019,4
47,"Tonight I got off work and i got a text from one of the few friends i have. I talk to him a lot and we hang out often. He asks for the number of a girl we are friends with because she invited him to the town carnival. He said can i have so and sos number because she invited me and i cannot find her. The three of us walked together at graduation, every class we had together, we sat as a group. The three of us hung out together just 5 days ago too. But what he said fucked me up emotionally. He had to say that she invited him to hang out. They arent dating either, this i know for a fact. I just feel kinda fucked over right now, i thought we were all friends. But was really shitty was i was having a light conversation with her while she was asking legit one of my only friends to hang out, when i thought the three of us were close.

54,"You're one of the kindest, selfless, and most people-loving person I've ever gotten to spend some time with. I know I haven't told you that, but in hindsight I wish I have. No one has ever gotten my emotions so tied up before as you have for fuck's sake.

It wasn't just lust; I knew it was more than that the first time we got to spend more than a few minutes talking. I just saw you as one of the sweetest, kindest, and friendliest people I've ever been around. The whole night was a fucking blur, but I just can't forget how we both just stumbled back to my place so we could smoke, and for you to show me some artsy stuff. I truly felt comfortable around you, and thought you were too!

Shit went on for a while between us, and I foolishly invested more of my thoughts and emotions towards you. Again, in hindsight it seems like I'm responsible for this, but I was still trying to figure out what's happening  next with my life; so I hoped I could make it last as long as possible till things got clearer. You know what I'm talking about, we all have these moments. This was the biggest problem in my opinion.. hadn't I sidelined you for most of that time, I might have shown you my true feelings earlier. All of this shit could've been different...  

It's been hard, but I finally realized that I should have listened to my guts the very next day. No one in my group believed I deserved settling for you, but fuck them. You had me, I couldn't do anything it at the time. I just kept hoping for the best. Oh my god, how fucking stupid am I?!! So many signs popped up to me that you weren't as interested as I was, and yet I just kept ignoring them as if it makes it less of a truth hahahah 

You really did get me girl, touché. What's frustrating and the funniest of this all?? That you probably don't even give a shit and already bounced, sorry I mean been bouncing, ever since we started hanging out. If you just kept your mouth shut, and kept it as it was I would probably be wrapped up with you both snoring and sleep talk. Oh well, it was fun while it lasted. I gotta end it somehow, and I've never been that open before with anyone so figured that might be my outing from you.  

I won't forget you, or any moment we've spent together. Yea yea, corny but I'm just a dude who loves falling for people. I never get used to the separation or break up with any of them. And you're my latest addition.  

Friends with benefits, will not lead to a healthy relationship fellas. That's what I think at least, same like when I just found out how you used to talk to my roommates' gf about the people you also were fucking with. Ouch, that really hurt. Way more than just finding out about your tinder being up. 

It's okay! I'm not upset or angry cause of what you have done. You deserve it, you should only settle down and truly commit to someone once you truly believe in it. No one can help you with this, *you got it.*

C'est la vie, guess it wasn't meant for us to be together now; probably never again but oh well like I said.. *This is life.*  I still want my shit back though.

56,"Hello all, I am a footballer and this is my journey to a professional.
(Sorry if my English is bad)


I started playing football when I was 7, I was playing alot on the streets. I started to become better but I wasn’t as talented as everyone else. A few years passed, signed my self to an amateur club when I was 9. I didn’t play on the highest levels, I went through teams in 4 years. I wasn’t good, after I went to high school I lost my motivation and quit at 12 years old. I didn’t play much on the streets anymore, once in a while with my friends. 

In 2017 I was 15 years old, I went through alot of shit and it got me thinking. People had something on me, I lost a very close friend and I got used alot. Even when I played the sport I loved the most I didn’t have an opinion, ’First get better at football and then talk’. Those words and that year made me the person who I am today. I started thinking, and a thought came in my head... I want to become a professional footballer. Whatever it takes. At 15 years old, I hadn’t played at a club for 3 years. I couldn’t juggle, I had no ball control, I had no shot technique, I was stressed when I got the ball, I couldn't dribble and I couldn’t even pass with my left foot.
But I knew one thing, with faith and hard work I would achieve my dreams, even though it seems impossible as there are alot of talented players at 15 years old. 
 I started training on my own, after school, on the streets till 22: 00-22:30 almost everyday. I became silent and started working in silence. I didn't talk much at school anymore or go outside, hang, I stopped wasting my time outside and started working on my self.  The only thought that went through my head was to become a professional and that no one could stop me. In my last year of school I had a lot of issues I didn't go much and I put my self fake sick alot. I had to go to the school doctor and had compulsory education. I was on the verge of failing my year, but I knew I had to pass to make things easier for me. The only thing that kept me going was faith, I made my exams and somehow I passed with a good result. This made me clear my head and focus more on my goal, I was 16 years old at this point I needed to go to college, for my parents. 

I just turned 17 and I went to college for 2 months, it didn’t work. I had more motivation to play football than to study. I quit my studies after a long talk with my parents and that I wanted to achieve something. They let me follow my dreams, the biggest blessing on this world. I started training again, I signed my self to a low level amateur club. I wanted to taste field football again, and it was hard, it was hard for me to fit in. I was very silent on the team, I was the only person who was serious about football, the rest of my team was playing for a hobby.     A season went by with a lot of ups and downs, learning and small injuries. Even though my first season again wasn’t that good, I had improved alot. Everything was a lot better than it was at first. After that season, I seeked for a new club with a higher level, I signed my myself to one of the best amateur clubs in my country. I hoped to get accepted, because I live like 25 kilometers away they don’t accept that easily. 
After a month I got an email that I was accepted, there are 6 teams, U19-1 is the best and U19-6 is the worst. They told me I could play for the U19-2. For once, I was very happy and delighted. I could show my talent for a bigger audience :). This was a big step into the right direction for me, because  no one in my family is related to sports and I cannot get support from my parents as they don’t earn alot, atleast enough for me to chase my dream by myself, alone!  I couldn’t ask them any more than that 🙏🏽. I don’t need money or expensive things. I worked and earn money myself to support my dream. 

I haven’t had alot of friends these 2 years, most of the time I was alone thinking about life and the future,as they say, ‘the road to success is often a lonely one’, but I don’t care as long as I can chase my dream and play this beautiful sport, this is my passion and I am willing to die for it. 

This is for my parents and for everyone who didn’t believe in me, for everyone who had something on me, for everyone who said I couldn’t be who I want to be. I want to inspire everyone and help everyone in this world with the same difficulties.
This is to prove all the haters wrong. 

I got accepted a couple weeks ago, I am 17 now and I am turning 18 in a month, 21 august. I go to the gym everyday and play football twice a day. When I started I never thought I could come this far that my dream is very possible right now. I went from impossible to possible. And this shows that YOU can do it too. 

For everyone who is struggling, don’t listen to anyone, keep your head up and set a goal for yourself, don’t waste your life looking at others and doing what you don’t like. Don’t be dependent, be yourself and chase your goals, because this life is too short to complain. 
I know I am just 17 years old but this is for yourself! 
I have a goal and I have faith. 

This is my journey, and I am not done yet.",12Jul2019,2

I don't know why you should read this, or what I expect from this post. I'm really bad at expressing feelings, fearing that I just sound like I'm lamenting. Maybe post might help someone.

Yesterday for a long time, I had this relieving feeling of lightheartedness. In a way that I've lost that sense of being trapped in a caged mindset. For a while I didn't give a shit about what people think of me, I could imagine myself comfortable in situations I wouldn't usually be.

For one moment I wasn't unsure of myself, not thinking of me as a characterless, boring sucker. I felt potential in myself, that I could be the person I always wanted to be.

What brought me to that? Just spontaneously visited a jazz concert. Maybe not a big deal, but this unbounded music triggered something. It made me help to forget my insecurity.

So experience new things, making stuff out of the comfort zone is the real deal. But at the same time, I am so frustrated that expect too much. I fall to quick into this cramped mindset. I am grasping for more and because this was so new to me, I fear that I can't escape this monotony.",12Jul2019,1

79,"Hi everyone,

I am writing this because I have no one to talk to. I need help and i cant seem to find a way to get help. I am an international student living in 
Canada. I have been struggling with depression for over a year. I am sick of feeling this way and my emotions are out of control. I feel so much pain that all
I can think about is ""ways to commit suicide"". I have a boyfriend. He is an amazing guy and he knows I am struggling with Depression and Anxiety. He has been supportive of me.
Lately, it got so much worse that we decided to seek help. As an international student, I dont have any insurance coverage. I am struggling to make ends meet. My final semester 
starts in January and I have to save up close to $8,500 as tuition. I have been trying to talk to a psychiatrist but it turns out I have to wait for months. 8 months ago,
when I thought i couldnt deal with anymore, I booked an appointment with a physician who works in a walk in clinic. I told her my problems, and she prescribed setraline and I took it for over 2 months 
and stopped when I felt like I was starting to forget things. She suggested that I see a Psychiatrist to evaluate my situation but I turned it down as I didnt have money. 
I started dating a guy later on and things seemed to get better, but every now and then I have been having melt downs and it started to affect our relationship. He suggested that I see a 
psychiatrist (even though I have no money to pay for it). I went to that physician again and she prescribed me the same medication again and referred me to a phychiatrist. She also mentioned 
i might have to wait longer than 2 months. I am on medication now but I dont think its helping me at all and I dont want to go back to that doctor again because I have no money to pay as consultation.
 I am on a strict budget because I need money for school. Yesterday my boyfriend and I had an argument about me not having a hobby. He said all i am doing is to keep him happy and do things for him.
He is right though. Thats what I like doing . I love taking care of him and doing things for him. I never used to play Video games but he plays a lot. I adapted to his ways and I started toplay games with him. It makes me happy when he is happy. Honesty though, I am not a clingy person and I never stop him from doing things he want to do. I spent almost everyday at his place and I do things that he likes doing. yesterday we had this argument and he said that I dont have a hobby and all I do is take care of him. He said I dont hang out with friends and he wants to have space. Its not that I dont
like hanging out with friends, its just that I dont have ""friends"". He is a canadian, he grew up here and he has many friends. I am a student who moved to canada 1.5 years ago. Its hard to make friends here. I do have friends but they are all boys and I don't like the idea of hanging out with boys when I am in a relationship. I personally feel its wrong. I wish i had more girlfriends. 
He went on talking about this and I felt awful. I live alone and I dont have any family members here. For the first time in my life, I felt alone. I am 27 years old and for the first time 
I felt like a piece of shit who did nothing with my life. He is an engineer and makes good money. For the first time I started questioning my existence and started thinking ""if I die today, noone will
know I am dead"". I did have suicidal thoughts before but today I felt way worse. I have a very painful past and it took me forever to recover. In canada, its so hard to get help unless its an emergency.
I feel suicidal and its really bad but I dont want to die. Who do i talk to? call 911 and say ""hey I feel suicidal , please help me ?"". I dont want to get admitted coz I dont have money to pay in the hospital. I feel awful. The pain I am feeling right now is unbearable. 
I guess thats enough ranting. I am scared to slit my wrist because its going to be painful and I cant seem to find a better way to die. I just want to die. I am sick and tired of being in pain and my body is literally giving up on me. My thoughts wont live me alone.",12Jul2019,4
80," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. 

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

A few days before She had sent me the other side of a city instead of her for an appointment with a letter one day because it was the 6 months stage after I called in sick to an appointment at reception when I wasn’t sick I had a job interview but I hated her so didn’t want to tell her.


I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else instead if that other place she sent me and told her i had an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself.

92,Ever since middle school I started having really bad night terrors. Sometimes I would have them every night and some nights I would have multiple night terrors in a row. Very few times I would go a couple nights without them. Some doctors brush it off and say they don’t know anything about it or they just kind of ignore it. I’ve tried anxiety/depression medication and that did nothing. The ONLY thing that worked was marijuana. I would only get a full nights sleep without a night terrors if I smoked marijuana. Now don’t take this the wrong way or assume that I’m some druggie. I’ve never taken any other drugs than marijuana. I occasionally enjoy a casual drink or two but for the most part I don’t have time to drink and I have up smoking weed a long time ago because I got a good job and I would never take the risk of getting drug tested.

Down the road there was a woman putting up a lost dog sign. It was the same dog I had seen earlier. I pull over and tell her someone has her dog. I gave her a ride and the man was still there fighting with the dog to get it in his car. “Walter!” She shouted. The dog instantly spun around. For its size it ran very fast.

I don't want to spend too much on my past problems, mostly because I feel like no one would take me seriously since I am young. But I have had generalized anxiety disorder for the past 7 years so I've felt like a mess for most of my recent life, but for the past year I've been very proud of what I've achieved and what I will continue to do. 

Please keep in mind I'm just a teen, still trying to figure out the adult world, so some of this stuff wouldn't be that impressive to older people. But I want to list out how I feel like my life has slowly come together over the past year, in nearly chronological order:

1.  A little over a year ago, I got out of a bad relationship. We were together for nearly 3 years. It turned very toxic and we had problems separating because of our low self-worth. We were arguing everyday but we wanted to make it work, then he had sex with another girl and I called everything off. And yeah, yeah, I get it's just high school boyfriend/girlfriend drama but it hurt me deeply but turned out to be one of the best things that could've happened to me. Through this, I learned self worth and realized I should take more control over the situations in my life that make me unhappy. 

2. My bad breakup lead to me meeting my current boyfriend. We just had our one year anniversary. We're still young and realize it's not too serious, but he has taught me a lot. He is very good at talking with others and controlling his stress. This has helped me a lot, I've been trying to chill out more, spend time to myself, and he's always helping me realize I'm too hard on myself. He has had severe depression for a decade and similar anxiety, which he gets medication and therapy for, so he has helped me learn how to deal with it. (For anyone wondering, I don't have meds or a therapist because my parents wouldn't let me, mostly because of financial reasons. Now that I'm 18, I'm going to be seeking out my own therapy because my college offers free appointments!)

3. I got my first real job eleven months ago. I have the same job as my boyfriend and we frequently get scheduled together so it has made work really fun. 

4. A few months ago, I graduated high school! I ended my last semester with all A's! I'm usually an A and B student so it felt great to end with all A's.

5. I picked up a new job of pet sitting. I find all my customers, schedule times, meet up with them, etc. all by myself. I have gotten over $300 in the past 2 weeks of pet sitting alone. This job makes me very happy, I love animals. I always forget that I'm getting paid and I feel so much stronger because I know I've done this 100% with my own work and determination. This has also helped me become more comfortable with speaking to new people. Two years ago, I would've never imagined I could do this. 

6. Just recently like 2 weeks ago, I got even another job! My brother is married to a nice Chinese lady. They both teach English to Chinese students. I have experience with Asian languages and foreigners so she has asked me to help her. All I have to do is have a phone conversation with her foreign Chinese students learning English from her. I get $20 for every hour of conversation. I am able to set my own schedule and it's very low-pressure. I'm really excited to push my boundaries, because I have been having a lot of practice with introducing myself to new people, but now I can push myself even further onto full conversations. This is a great opportunity to save up more money and keep practicing my people skills.

7. Yesterday, I had my first doctors appointment since I was a baby (my parents refused to take me when I was younger for financial reasons and because my dad is in a medical profession). I got prescribed birth control because I have really painful periods and hormonal acne. This is very different for me so I'm excited to see if this will get rid of my pain and hopefully my acne. 

My money: I try to not focus on money too much but I must admit, I love being financially stable. I have ~$2,500 in my bank account (over $1000 in both savings and checking). I have ~$500 in cash. I make about $400 every two weeks. Sure, it's not that much for the adult world but it's a lot of money to me. 

Future plans: I'm quitting my first job that I have with my boyfriend because I'm moving to college this August. I'm looking forward to this because the management has changed a lot for the worse and a new girl keeps threatening to fight me (long story) so it's become stressful. I'm going to keep pet sitting until I have to move for college, but I'm not going to continue when I'm in college and taking classes. I am very excited to continue speaking with Chinese students. Again, I can set my own schedule so I imagine this will be good for when I have all my classes. I'm hoping to make friends and find interesting classes in college because I'm very interested in my major, anthropology.

As it was a slow Friday afternoon everyone took the time to make their own pair of paper glasses so that I didn't feel self conscious about it and it was hilarious! Little moments like that make me so happy and grateful to have the job I have and know the people I know.

I'm in such a good mood that pictures of my partner's failed cooking attempts have had me laughing out loud on the bus home. For the most part I'm quite a serious person who makes sure that I keep a professional face up at work but that completely evaporated today.

103,"Four years ago, the worst thing I could have ever imagined happened: my mom, my best friend, the absolute love of my life died suddenly. I had pictured it a million times, what it’d be like to lose her. I never thought I could survive it. The years that followed after were horrendous. To be honest, I still feel like I don’t have a place in the world and I desperately want answers, or guidance at the very least.

I have a degree in education and, well, to put it simply: it’s been a disaster. My first year, I was treated horribly and wasn’t hired back. My second and third years I was at a school that expected a lot in exchange for very little. Nothing compares to this past year, though. I had a position at an international school in Europe but due to a child making serious accusations and no help from the director (the child has serious behavior problems), I left the position. I went to another European city that was even more of a disaster: I got kicked out of an Airbnb and the job I had wasn’t paying enough, I would’ve had to spend money to stay there. I went back home and was unemployed for a few months due to the school year being in full session with no open positions. I found a job as an aide at a school that put money before children, working with a teacher who didn’t seem to put the children’s interest at heart. There were also some serious family issues and behavior problems. I left that school for a permanent sub position at another school. I didn’t love it. I feel drained. This is all I pictured myself doing and now I’m questioning if it’s even what I want to do. If not this, what else? I want to travel the world and discover new places and cultures, it’s the most beautiful thing in the world to me! I can’t do the 9-5, only weekends, slaving at a desk, only to get a few weeks of vacation- if I’m lucky.

I’m going to be 28 on Thursday and feel more lost than I’ve ever felt. On top of all this, I’ve had serious issues with my dad, one of my brothers, extended family, and friends not being there for me. At one point, all I wanted was to be dead. I even tied a scarf around my neck to see if I could kill myself if I wanted to. 

I’ve found that travel brings myself back. The past three summers, I’ve been able to travel. Au Pair in Europe where I met an amazing guy, volunteering in Tanzania to give teachers modern ways of teaching with the resources they have, and volunteering teaching English in Colombia. Today, I feel happy. I feel like I can do anything. I feel blessed. I still feel lost as all hell, but I realized I’m proud of who I am and despite being a mess with my career, I think my mom would be proud. I’ve met some amazing people in my travels and I genuinely care about people. I love helping people and taking care of others, it’s who I’ve always been and who I’ll always be. Things have changed significantly with a lot of my good friends, but I still have some friends who care for me deeply. I have an amazing brother and sister-in-law who welcome me with open arms any time I want. I have two beautiful nieces and a fur baby waiting for me at home. I don’t know where I’m going, and I often still feel out of place no matter where I am but I think I’ll be ok. I’m not dumb by any means and I have a spirit that won’t quit. I’m learning to trust God and let it be. I miss my mom more than anything and I’d trade everything to have her back any day. But, life is still beautiful. I think I will be ok. People said for years that it would get better. Truthfully, it hasn’t. 

I’m fully aware this feeling isn’t going to last and I know I will go back to feeling lost and broken, but I cherish these days. Days where everything seems beautiful and opportunities are endless. Maybe one day I’ll figure myself out. Maybe I’ll never feel like I belong. Maybe I’ll always be discovering parts of myself I didn’t know were there. But, for now, today is a day where I feel like I can do anything. 

Keep fighting. Life isn’t easy, but find something to hold on to and keep going. Stay strong, my friends.",12Jul2019,3

108,"I (m35) broke up with my girlfriend (f35) 
 of 19mo’s back in May. Since then over several weeks I noticed a fog begin to develop over my overall happiness and mental state. I attributed it to boredom and just being sort of blah about life in general but the feeling began to become more all-consuming to the point where I wasn’t even leaving the house.i should also point out I haven’t been single for more than a few weeks since I was about 28.

Anyway, cut to last night, ex and I are testing the water for a possible reconciliation and after sex last night, today I feel like my normal self. Colors are brighter, my sense of well being seems potent and in tact and the fog feels like it’s been lifted. 

That said, my feelings towards my ex gf don’t seem any more intense or different—that is to say I’m not being swept up in new romantic feelings for her—feels more like I took a dose of some medication. It’s not that I was lonely or pining for a new relationship, either. I wasn’t even interested in dating. The ennui just crept up and it was awful. 

I don’t even know how to move forward now, I guess I just wanted to reflect on anecdotally on my experience. Sex is something I’ll have to take into account more seriously if/when I become single so I don’t fall into the doldrums mentally I guess.",12Jul2019,8
109,"I'm 22, dealt with anxiety since I was a child and depression since I was a teenager. It comes in waves, where sometimes I'll feel like I might be living a fulfilling life and then sometimes all I can think of is how I should die. I've always been super shy, which has contributed to a lot of these feelings. Like it feels almost impossible for me to open up to someone and be myself. In college, I mostly devoted all my time to studying and isolated myself a lot. I had a few friends who I got really close to in college, but when my anxiety/depression got bad, I would just stop talking to them because I would convince myself that no one would want to be friends with me anyway. I can see how rationally that probably isn't true, but it still didn't stop me from telling myself that.

Anyway, I recently started a new job (a little over a month ago) that is extremely draining emotionally, physically, and mentally. Today I saw something at work very distressing (involving blood, crying, etc.) that just made me start to have a panic attack. My mind started racing, and without even thinking, I just ran out into the parking lost and lost it. All I could think was that I'll never be good at anything, I'm such a failure, I've disappointed everyone I work with, I embarrassed myself, I hate myself, I can't do this job, I wasted my education on something I can't even handle, why can't I handle things like a normal human being?

I've been having a really, really hard time with this job. Frankly, I don't even know why I thought it would be a good idea. I find the subject interesting but put to practice, I can't handle it -- but I was too ashamed to admit that to myself. Because I hate feeling like I'm different from people with a normal tolerance to stressful situations, so I just told myself that I would be fine.

I couldn't pull myself to go back in. Essentially, I just let all my fears and anxieties control me, my life, my first ""real world"" job! I drove home. My mind became dark very fast. Just telling myself the worst possible things about myself.. like I'll never amount to anything, I have failed myself, I'm stupid, I don't know what I'm supposed to do with my life now, I wasted so much time being scared, preparing myself for this and now all my aspirations are crushed. I was thinking a lot of suicidal thoughts too.

I want to try to get better by seeing a psychologist, but I also don't think I can afford it right now because of students loans and bills and the fact that I just lost my job because I impulsively made a terrible decision. If anyone has any advice for how I could get help mentally or what I could do to waste as little time as possible (career wise) and find something I actually feel fulfilled doing, I would appreciate it so much.

tldr; had a panic attack at work because I can't handle the stress, left. mind started spiraling again with self-hatred and now I feel more lost in life than ever.",12Jul2019,1
110,"There is a festival going on in the town I’m working in over the summer. I don’t have really any friends here, but some of my hometown friends are coming up Saturday.

111,"This is actually a **TRUE STORY**

&amp;#x200B;

Hey, I am casual 17yo gamer and already had some crazy ghost stories I wanted to share with someone that I don't even know and want to know their opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 14 or 15, I was sitting at the PC like almost every single evening, I was playing some games w/ my friends, it could be like 9pm or something if I remember correctly and I had doors on my right, all of the sudden I looked that way no idea why, I would normally turn that way only if I heard something there or someone was opening a door, but I didnt hear a thing, so I looked at the door.. I saw a big figure, not sure if it was male or female, but I am pretty sure that it was male, since he was really tall and had a figure of a man, he was completely black, even light wasn't going trough him, worth mentioning that the doors were 70% glass. I was staring at him like 1 sec, tears started coming out of my eyes, but I didnt cried completely my eyes were watering. I looked at the monitor and then right back, he wasn't there no more. I remember next day telling my mom, she believed me.

&amp;#x200B;

We moved to next flat, since they raised rent, we're kinda poor so we had to move + we didn't trusted that guy, he was new owner of the whole house or idk how to call it I am not from England.

&amp;#x200B;

In the flat I am living right now something happened aswell. We're living in 2 + kitchen (idk how to type it, so I'll type it like that) I was in living room next to my mom staring at the TV but all of the sudden I thought I saw something in the corridor like 3-4m next to the TV, I looked there so I could be more sure I didn't saw anything so I didn't even bothered telling my mom, but after like few seconds there was something there like looking at me from the corridor behind a wall I looked at it, it was peeking but after few milisec. it hid behind the wall, my eyes started watering again so I told mom, since I was standing behind her and she even saw my eyes how they were watering I went into my room since I wanted to get that thing I saw out of my head (no idea why I did that).

&amp;#x200B;

After few days my mom told me that she always wanted to be Medium and maybe her wish got onto me somehow.

Just want one thing I forgot to mention that all of this started happening when I was like 6yo +/- and remember seeing face in a corner window, when I got under blanket and it was gone, until today I am not sure if it was a dream or not, but how could you remember dream THAT long?

I'm 26. I'm an ugly, weak, soy boy. I'm skinny- fat, I'm short, I have narrow shoulders.

I tried for 7 years to work out. I worked myself to the bone. I read every fitness book.  I did every popular strength training and bodybuilding program. I tracked every calorie and protein.

You know what happened? I hardly changed and even worse, I wore out the cartilage in my shoulder because I had been training so hard. I can no longer lift now. And I look like absolute shit.

I would always go on fitness forums or asks these bros and they would always shame me and tell me that I'm a pussy who isn't trying hard enough. Except I was in the gym longer than any of them where. I was so desperate to look good.

Now I can't do anything about it. My only hope would be to inject steroids and lift super light weights.

131,"Let me start by saying that I am not a man hater by any means. I have a lot of wonderful good men in my life but lemme tell you some of them I want to smash right in the face. 
I'm a female uber driver. I've done over 600 trips and have only had about 4 bad experiences but yesterday I had a particularly upsetting trip. I got a request to pick someone up from a pretty nice hotel downtown. When I arrived, two men (60ish) and (45ish) got into my car and we start driving. The older man stated ""I hope your husband isn't out playing golf while you're out here doing all the work."" I laughed a little but didn't say anything. I wanted to be polite because I have a 5 star rating that I'm trying not to mess up. Then he asks me straight out ""do you have a husband?"" ""No"" Was my response and to this he says ""oh, even better for me."" I ignore the comment and keep driving. I'm a lesbian and am in a serious relationship with a woman who I plan to someday ask to marry me. This is part of the reason that I drive for uber. Im saving up to buy her a ring. I don't feel that if I tried to explain this to these two guys that they would understand. Not to mention, you never know how people will react to that and being alone in my car with two grown men didn't make me feel exactly secure in my own skin. So I keep it to myself. They start asking typical questions like a lot of my passengers do...is this your only job, are you in school, what's your major, kids?etc. I tell them that I work full-time, go to school full-time majoring in Biology and have an 8 year old as well as the part time uber thing. The younger guy mentions to me that they manage a company that hires a lot of biologists and that when I'm finished with school I should consider their company. I said thank you and that I would check it out. After a few minutes the older guy starts telling the younger guy about a woman that he'd met earlier in the hotel lobby. He said that she was a very attractive young woman and that she was sitting there reading and not talking to him. He said that after about 20 minutes of watching her he decided to approach her and strike up a conversation. He then mentions that the chat was going really well until she mentioned her wife. ""I couldn't get out of there and back to my room fast enough once I knew that she didn't have anything to offer me."" They both started laughing and then the younger guy starts mentioning different women that work for their company who are gay. ""A lot of them are very smart women, have a master's or PhD but let me tell you when these women are gay they are useless to me. They are worth nothing"" he said. They both laugh and continue to name women and talk about how beautiful or ugly each one is. At this point I'm pissed. They have no idea that I'm gay but that's beside the point. I'm a woman. And they are blatantly speaking in front of me about women as if they are objects put on earth souly for the purpose of sexually pleasing them. Still, I'm polite. I know it's just Uber. It's not my career and it's not my full-time job but I'm not about to let two idiots give me a bad rating because I might say something to defend myself and others. We are almost to their drop off point when the younger guy tells me ""consider coming to work for us when you finish your degree"" and places his business card on my shoulder. 
They left and I started crying. Not because I was sad. I cry when I'm angry. And I was furious. They don't know me. They don't know my girlfriend. They don't know that my son lights up when she comes home and that she brings so much joy to both of us. She's a doctor. She saves people's lives. But in their eyes, if they knew her, they would consider her useless. Worth nothing. I'm not useless and neither is she. She's a beautiful, intelligent, amazing woman. We don't hold hands in public unless we're in a gay bar. I don't care about what other people think so yes, I would like to not have to be 3 feet apart whenever we are out. But I'm not going to push her or ask her to be more comfortable with putting her arm around me or holding hands. I understand why she's afraid. She's afraid to be judged, looked down on, stared at. It's because of people like this and I am so sick of it.",12Jul2019,119

134,"It started in October 2018 where I slipped a disc. The pain was so excruciating I couldn't walk for a couple weeks. Lost my job in the process and made a full recovery by Christmas Day.

Come January, I met a girl and fell so hard for her. She was the first woman in years who felt/sought something valuable in me.  However I was jobless and broke, so I worked my ass off to find a job. Wasn't until April where I got hired for some temp contract, and out-did myself whilst I was in the role. Sadly I couldn't get kept on. By the time I saved up enough to take her out for a date, she breaks news to me that she's getting engaged to someone else and apologised for leading me on. Few days after she tells me this, one of my closest friends suddenly passes away.

Decided to go to Amsterdam to get away from the madness and have fun, to then have a disgusting anxiety attack where I thought I was going to get murdered. I couldn't leave the hostel for the rest of the trip.

After returning home, the girl who told me she was getting engaged comes back and tells me her engagement plans crumbled. We end up talking again and having much deeper conversations. We were making plans to meet until she misunderstood something I said, and got so mad at it that she blocked me off everything and cut me off before giving me a chance to explain myself. She doesn't want anything to do with me now, as anything I say or do just makes me seem more villainous to her. It sucks, because all I wanted to do was love her, and look after her.

Not long after, this anonymous stalker I have on Twitter (claims to formerly be internet friends with me) graces my DMs and basically laughs at me &amp; rubs it in my face that my love life failed, that I'm single and heartbroken, and she's already married. She also told me I'd never be the career titles I want to be, and boasted about how she's better than me because she's already working manager roles, while I'm still unemployed and trying to make a break for a full-time, permanent role.

Last week I went out for a skate. Since recovering in January, I felt myself getting stronger and became better than ever at skateboarding. All of a sudden, I injure my back again (on a lesser scale). That same afternoon, I couldn't walk again and had to army crawl all over the house. I'm able to walk now and move normally, but I'm crushed because now it means I'll have to quit skateboarding for good after 10 long years.

Today I got news that despite a tremendous 2.5hr job interview I had, I didn't get this sweet role that would've been a huge turning point in my life - as I didn't have the required skills.

Throughout this whole year, my parents have been focused on my sisters, brother, and grandfather. They both admitted that my issues are minor to them, compared to everything else happening in the family. It's cool though, as they're kinda right in a way.

So now I have a beautiful face haunting me, with no skateboarding freedom, whilst I try to find a new job, with nobody to open up to. Honestly? I have never felt so alone and demotivated before in my life.",12Jul2019,2
135,"If it matters, since my earliest memory I have always liked men and women literally equally, and admire both the same amount. I'm also bisexual, feeling attraction to both sexes.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm biologically male, but don't necessarily identify super strongly with it. I just sort of do whatever I like and don't make it a point of how much of a ""man"" I can come off as. I don't really mind insults that belittle my masculinity, while most other guys hate it more than anything.

&amp;#x200B;

And overall...I wouldn't mind being female. I feel like I literally would not.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean of course it'd be weird and different at first, but it wouldn't be the end of the world. I'd just sort of learn to live with it. The way I see it, I admire women way too much to be ""ashamed"" of becoming one. Of course I'm talking a hypothetical scenario, but I feel like I just wouldn't mind.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, according to research, I guess what I feel is called being ""agender."" Of course, I don't necessarily have to be labeled as such. I could just simply be a guy who doesn't conform to gender stereotypes, and who's very open about the opposite sex. But that's what it's called.",12Jul2019,23

138,"I’m really excited. I’ve already made a list of all the things I want to talk about with my therapist. There’s so much healing that I need and I’m excited to begin the journey. Also, today is the first day I have been able to get out the house and go to the gym. It was a pretty pathetic effort, I couldn’t give as much as I used to but I’m still motivated that I did something.",12Jul2019,2
139,"i'm 26, and i went through an awful breakup just over a year ago. it killed all the confidence and self esteem that i had- it destroyed me. i'm way better now, but the problem is i haven't gotten laid since. 

i want to start dating again but i have 0 sexual confidence, absolutely none. so i just thought before i start dating girls i actually like, let me get that awkward sex out of the way with a professional before i start seeing girls i actually am interested in because i'm basically a virgin again. i haven't been intimate with a girl since we broke up and that's really taking a toll on me. just wanted to share.. thank you",12Jul2019,0
141,"I was friends with a girl, Sara. We had got into an argument when I realized she was a toxic friend.After that we went for a walk, arguing the whole time.  and this is what happened. 

The ground caved in between where we were standing. But her voice was all I heard. ""You get what you deserve. "" She said angerily. It was thunderstorming, I shook in fear.

She wanted to hurt me. I looked around. There was nowhere to hide. I tried to think of a reason to prove her wrong. That maybe we could start over and save our friendship. 

I told her the reason. (I don't remember what it was.) ""So give me a reason that proves me wrong,  I dare you! "" She laughed. ""It's too late to start over. We have no good memories together. ""

I thought for a moment. Every loss, every lie, every truth that she'd deny, Every regret, every goodbye, those where mistakes too great to hide.
I didn't have any reason to connect and fill the holes in  our friendship. The truth that lies was she was toxic, and she would never change. 

""Fine."" I said. ""You're not worth it. Goodbye, Sara. I won't try to talk to you ever again. Across this new divide.""

She smiled. ""Across this new divide. """,12Jul2019,0
142,"22m working a dead end job at a coffee shop with no education and a case of the nerves. Im just lost and know the life im living is not sustainable  for the future I want. The only thing i want out of my future is to raise a family of moral and responsible children. Money doesnt mean much to me in the sense of I dont want a lavash lifestyle with fancy cars and house. I have limited social skills and the only person i see outside of work is my room mate. Im lost and dont really know what to do. I traveled for about 1 straight when I was 20, but have ran out of money and have a lease I got with an ex i cant break until dec. 


Tldr; My life has stagnated. Where do i meet like minded people for friends and partners? And how do i find that sense of wonder and adventure i had as a brand new adult?",12Jul2019,1
144,"I (22M) just do not understand what I am supposed to feel when entering a relationship or in the talking phase. When I start talking and spending more time with an individual I do enjoy their company, I enjoy doing things together, I enjoy kissing them and all that. But when it comes down to how I feel I don’t know what I supposed to feel or how I feel it does not make sense. How am I supposed to know if I should really persue this and enter a relationship. Usually what happens is I just start to feel more and more unsure of myself and start to back off and I think I what if this is the wrong person or I see other people I might be interested in and dive down a rabbit hole of wonder about pursuing a different woman. Thus killing whatever was happening and most of the time losing them as a friend as well. It doesn’t make it any better than people seem to get attached to me kind of quickly, I’m pretty easy going, do my own thing and what have you. I just don’t know what I am supposed to do, I feel like a womanizer but I don’t do it on purpose I am just uncertain I guess.",12Jul2019,3
146,"I’m under a lot of stress currently. It’s just been mounting more and more every day.

I meditate to try and find release from that stress, and it has helped, but the source of my stress is ever present.

The stress has been manifesting itself in my body: I’m breaking out, I have stomach cramps, my back aches, and I haven’t had a solid poo for five days. I’m depressed. I’m tired all the time. I haven’t had an appetite. Joy isn’t present in my life currently. I feel like I’m just scraping by. I haven’t talked to anyone about it because I am afraid to express that I am not doing well. I want to talk to my boyfriend about it, but I’m afraid to—I’ve had bad experiences in the past when I was vulnerable about my dark times. Not that my boyfriend would treat me poorly like people in the past have because I don’t think he would do that. I also worry that I’m some kind of sickness or contaminant, people have always said I’m “too much to handle”

I just don’t know how to find the balance with being honest about when I’m struggling and being “too much”.",12Jul2019,2

148,"Well, I owned a car before but it was a very cheap, old car with a lot of miles. 

Now, as of today, I am the owner of a new (to me) 1014 Hyundai Veloster Turbo! I'm so excited!

It's not everyone's favorite look, and it's not like it has 400 horsepower... but I love the look and style of it. So thrilled!",12Jul2019,16

151,"Just wanted to share my feelings. Ed sheeran is an amazing artist. 50k people came to listen to this wonedrful music (which may not seem like very much, but this is a very small country). I just think its amazing that this crowd of reserved, quiet people staets dancing, and loudly singing along to every song thats played. And he does that himself, with his guitar, and nothing else. The artists that played before him (zara larsson and james bay) were really good, but they had a band, backup vocals, dancers etc. Ed doesn't have anything of that. He can just sing and play his guitar, and the crowd goes silent, to listen and hear everything, or sings along. I just love his music. 

Well yeah, im fangirling but who really cares.",12Jul2019,7
