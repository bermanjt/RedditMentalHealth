0,"I'm feeling more and more sad, by the day and I have absolutely no reason to... I've been going it over and over in my head for the past few months and can't figure out what's wrong with me. 

Background: I'm in my early 30s, have a high paying job in the finance-IT sector which I don't like at all but I get paid a lot compared to my university peers (it really helps out financially) , I have a 800k house which is  almost paid off, a condo investment worth another 400k, so I'm well off, have a loving and supporting family, a great baby boy 2years old... Everything should be great..

Yet, I am so sad all the time. I work from home 3 days a week which I don't think it helps and can't really change job either since I won't find something as good. I feel stuck and sad.

I need to do something, and it drives me crazy sad. I'm full of fear uncertainty and doubt and I don't know what to do... :(

I'm ashamed to tell anybody since these issues(bring sad all the time and all) don't seem to be problems, given everything that I have I should be  grateful and I want to but don't know how... 

It seems I was happier when things were worse. 

I don't know what to do. What is certain is that I'm in a sadness spiral continually going down :(

10,"I've been married for two years, and I no longer want to socialize with two of my husband's friends; a couple.

I find them to be obnoxious, too alcohol-dependent, have idiotic conversations (like vegan cows, because they eat grass, so that makes them vegan) and just not worth the time we spend with them.

Hes been friends with them for a 3 years, and when i first met them, i liked them. They were fun and outgoing. and i suppose they still are, but everything we do always involves drinking. and they drink way to much and are NOT fun to be with they drink. they always get into a fight making it awkward to be around them. They cause drama always.

Plus, my husband acts differently when he hanging out with them. Ive told him that and i dont like the person he is when hes with them. He agrees he acts differently when spending time with them. So i said i didnt want to spend much time with them anymore. I always just tolerated all their stupid loud behavior and watched quietly on the sidelines until it was time to go home.

18,"I've been staying at my current hostel for the past week. It hasn't been great.

This morning I'm going about my lazy routine and have to take a shit. I go to the only bathroom in the place and all three stalls are taken, the middle occupant isn't wearing shoes. No biggie.

I come back 15 minutes later to find that only the middle stall is occupied, still by Mr. Barefoot. I try the left stall, no toilet paper. I try the right stall, again no TP.

So I'm like fuck it, I just joined a gym that's like 2 blocks away, I'll just take a shit there. I quick change and grab my workout stuff (why not kill 2 birds with one stone ;) and head out the door. By this time the situation is getting \*cough\* urgent.

I make it about a quarter of the way to the gym before an unexpected nugget of a turd sneaks out and is now being clenched between my butt cheeks. If I unclench my butt cheeks this shameful nugget is going to drop to the pavement. I weigh my options. I turn around and waddle back to the hostel bathroom.

It's been another 15 minutes since the last time I checked the bathroom and the barefooted douche is still in the middle stall. I enter the right stall and do my business. My plan is to wait until this selfish, no-shoes-havin' asshole next to me exits his stall so that I can quick switch and actually wipe/feel okay about myself. But how long does my patience last?

I sit there for another 20 minutes on my phone while simultaneously listening to his shallow, even breathes. He ain't leaving. I give up and decide to just wipe at the gym bathroom (my hostel room doesn't have anything that I can think to wipe with). So I walk to the gym with a poopy butt crack (which no one likes) and hurriedly power walk straight to the toilet in back. I thoroughly wipe. I have to wet some toilet paper in the sink to do a good job since the poop has started to dry. Then I have a mediocre workout.

Question: What was this man with no shoes doing in the bathroom for at least 50 minutes?

Note: I'm pretty sure that the right and left stall occupants from my original entry to the bathroom also didn't get to wipe. This man needs to be stopped.",09Jan2019,1
19,"I work at a decent job that pays well for the area. The only problem is it’s incredibly boring. I work for Amazon at a warehouse and generally just move boxes. That’s all I can really say per privacy agreement. I like the job, but I find it hard to want to work my full shifts due to how slow the day moves doing anything there. I don’t feel motivated to work. 

Most shifts last 3-5 hours and sometimes there’s an in between of two and a half hours per shift. That discourages me from working more than one shift because I work 25 minutes from the warehouse. I don’t want to fill my gas tank twice a week going back and forth twice a day to work 6-10 hours a day. I guess if I’m just being picky then I can start to do that.

Hi not sure if this is the correct subreddit but i had this thought occur to me a few minutes ago. Allow me to share:

Building a relationship is more rewarding than just landing in a “perfect” relationship. 

Take this with a grain of salt if you’d like, since i’m only a junior in high school. I’m in my 3rd relationship and we’ve been together for 1 year. Once again, i know i’m not experienced at all. Just making sure you know i’m aware of how much i might not know yet. 
But I say this because I’ve gone through emotional phases, and we’ve had some low points. Like really low. Even when it gets tough, however, i’m really glad that i can learn some patience and even pain with someone who i honestly love. 

Think about it like this:

Imagine winning the lottery, great right?
You get to buy everything and anything you’ve ever wanted. Great. Awesome. Cool.

Now imagine studying hard in school, sacrificing a few nights at the club here and there. Hours of research and homework. Eventually, after months and years of hard work, you earn a good degree, and you eventually land a great job with amazing pay. Once again, you could buy a lot with that great pay. 

But which scenario would feel better? This could be open to debate, of course, but in my opinion it’s clear that the latter would feel 10x better. 
Relationships are the same. You work hard, sacrifice some things and compromise, cry and stress, and feel intense and deep love for your partner. 

This is obviously not so much of a “cookie-cutter” for all relationships, but more of a generalization. Once more, i’m open for discussion and even disagreements. I’m definitely young and inexperienced. Just wanted to share a thought. 

[TL;DR]
Building a relationship is more rewarding than just landing in a “perfect” relationship, because you experience pain and you work hard. Once you figure it out eventually, it’s a great relationship and is better than just some “perfect” relationship from the start that never hits any lows, obviously preventing any deep connection (imho).",09Jan2019,1

27,"When I was 15 I got my first job. Fell in love with my much older  manager and he smashed my heart into a thousand pieces. He led me on a ton and acted very inappropriately sexual towards me, I told him how i felt, he told me he didn’t feel the same, I had to beg him to stop acting sexually towards me afterwards because they hurt my feelings so much. He ended up dating a girl younger then me for a number of years. I know he sounds like a real jerk, but honestly he was just an inexperienced idiot who didn’t know what to do with all the attention he got from his younger employees. He has since married a girl his own age, has two kids. I would say mostly not an ass anymore. Recently I moved to the town he lives and works in, I needed a job,  and he offered me a job at the store he manages. I am now 28. It’s been over ten long year since that happened and I am also married happily with 2 kids. 

But working with him makes me so angry. He doesn’t even do anything. He’s kind of an stickler for rules and it comes off as assholeish but other then that he has been nice, adjusted my schedule with no problems, and gone slightly out of his way to make me feel more comfortable. I thought I was over it. I thought I was an adult and I could put the past behind me but I don’t know if I can.

I think I’m still mad and I don’t even know why. I’m better off I think. My husband won’t win any prizes but he loves me and I love him and my kids are wonderful. I’ve been there a week and the last three nights I couldn’t sleep because I keep thinking about telling my manager off. How much better I would feel.

How do I get over this and act like an adult? How do I let it go, without making a scene and putting my new job in jeopardy. I don’t want to drag up the past. We are both happy. I don’t want to be mad anymore . ",09Jan2019,1

After hours of analyzing arguments, he said he didn’t want to go on. He proposed we go on a drive. I agreed. We went far off into the desert. We were just driving. Talking about our families. Taking about my messed up living situation. He’d keep starting at me.

31,"I use level editors all the time. I've used them for as long as I can remember. In first grade there was a shitty program at school that let you build a town. I used that all the time back then. I created my own imaginary planet with creatures that have specific functions in their environment. I've used the Source engine tools more times than any other engine. I love the history of computer entertainment. I love listening to developer commentary and reading about how games are made. I love how games are works of art and how they can make you feel things no other medium can.

But now my love is tested, because earlier in the decade, I started realizing that mobile games, specifically Supercell games, are becoming a legitimate way to make a **metric shit tonne** of money. I said to my friends that one day, real games are going to become like a mobile game.

Arbitrary wait times.

Arbitrary micro-transactions.

Minimal gameplay.

Advertisements.

And they didn't believe me. And now I'm watching the video game world collapse as publishers become hated by the few who enjoy traditional video games and are ignored by their oblivious target audience. And one day, a big budget, console game, ***will*** have advertisements in it. It is only a matter of time.

So I bring the question to you.

If everything I love about the art of video games doesn't matter anymore, and if my dream to create beautiful works of art is not smiled upon by the industry, then should I give up on my dream?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to bring people to bummer town so I'll clarify a few things here.

1. I don't hate mobile games as a whole, just mostly Supercell. I don't like hating people but they drive me crazy. If you guys want to play a good game on the mobile market then buy Space Marshals. **I HIGHLY RECOMMEND EVERYONE READING THIS TO BUY A COPY.** It is only five dollars and it's a REAL GAME.
2. I am not wholly apathetic towards the idea of becoming a game developer. I am in a very rough spot of questioning my life choices.
3. I am very well aware of the 1983 video game recession. Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.

32,"Reflection of last year:

I left my main social circle because my best friend physically abused his girlfriend. When I defended her, I got “the only reason you’re on her side is because you’re girls.” I listened to everyone else in the group defend the abuser with the excuse “that’s just how he is. He has a short temper. She shouldn’t make him mad.” I couldn’t be around these people anymore. And I took the girlfriend (now ex girlfriend) with me. It was such an emotionally exhausting process but well worth it because for once in her life, she’s happy. 

I had to separate myself from another dear friend because he touched my female best friend sexually inappropriately and he refused to apologize because she “lead him on.” 

I had to slowly cut off one of my girl friends because she lets her boyfriend dictate her life and it has interfered with our friendship. She will no longer hangout unless *he* feels like it but then she’ll start guilt tripping me when I stop inviting her to outings I know she’ll say no to. What’s the point? It’s always going to be no because *he* says no. 

I’m becoming a little unhappy with work because people only talk shit on each other. 

I stopped hanging out with another friend because all he cares to talk about is how stressful his life and his stupid baby momma drama. It’s the same shit, different day. Thanks for asking how my life is going, dude. I’m not your therapist. 

My older friend likes to comment about how much “I’m growing” or makes comments like “oh, look at you being an adult.” Fuck you. This isn’t a compliment. I was never some naive child. I just got tired of putting up with shit. 

My friends won’t stop trying to get me to drink/party no matter how many times I tell them I want to be sober. 

I feel like I have validated reasons for cutting some people off but I feel like I’m losing patience easily now and I don’t want to be this angry person. I don’t want people to feel like they need to walk on eggshells but my tolerance for what I consider bullshit is nearly nonexistent. I notice I’m more arguable and irritable around some friends and I don’t want to be. Am I just working too much? Is the stress from work/studying catching up? Am I irritable because I’m trying to be sober?

On coworker leaves about 4 or so hours after arriving. It's just me, F(female coworker) and M(male coworker). We are chatting and drinking a little. I start to feel left out which happens but it's not so comfortable at my apartment. Anyways they seem to get really close. F is touching M a lot not sexually just like holding hands and running her fingers through his hair. He holds on to her by her waist, arm, hand. They seem to me pretty close, maybe too close?

I grew up in a small town with a population of just under 1,400 people.  It’s just over a mile in all directions and is half surrounded by a river.  A set of railroad tracks (former Rock Island Railroad) also surrounds half the city and a siding (former Chicago and North Western Railroad) cuts the city in half extending through town.  The city has 2 bars, 2 parks, one state park at the south end of town across the tracks, a rural volunteer fire department, a volunteer EMS service (which seems to service the county), a small grocery store, and small meat locker.  It's an everybody knows everybody town.  I grew up on a street that the city limits run on; with me having to live in the county side.  If I had to call 911 for an emergency, the Sheriff's Office had to respond.  Not much happened in the city as far as serious crime went. 

Growing up my father was friends with the Chief of Police named Dan.  Dan was a great guy teaching me all about law enforcement, keeping me on the straight and narrow, and even letting me ride along with him to see the job of a police officer.  He worked hard for many years keeping the city free of crime.  I began to enjoy talking with Dan and wanted to become a police officer myself, working as Dan’s officer.  I eventually moved into town.  Then came the day Dan had made his resignation from Chief of Police public stating he was resigning after being chief for over 10+ years.  He was moving to another Chief position in a bigger city that paid more.  Once Dan resigned and moved away, the officer at that time, let’s call him Bill Smith, was appointed Chief of Police by a newly elected City Council.  Chief Smith was in his fifties, and after being fired from another department for sleeping on duty in a squad car, moved to our small town to be an officer and get away from the previous department to somewhere where no one knows him.  Since the city had no full time officers at the time, Bill hired on an officer named Cory and another, we will call Bob.  Bob was hired to be full time while Cory was a reserve officer.  (As a side note Bob wasn’t able to pass the physical fitness test at the ILEA and had to be put down as a police reserve too, until recently.  He now is able to work full time as an officer because he is a full time EMT now.  He wears a uniform and drives the squad car in the downtime of no ambulance calls.)

Now this is where I come in to the picture.  See, I was attending college for law enforcement and got the opportunity to intern with the police department.  I was as excited as a kid at the carnival.  I was hoping to be able to fulfill my dream of becoming a city officer, for I grew up wanting to work as a cop in my hometown.  So I took the opportunity and said yes to the internship.  I showed up almost everyday and rode with Chief Smith as well.

Now if you walked into City Hall, immediately inside the first set of doors to the left is the wooden door to the police department.  Inside the police department were 2 desks.  The desk to the left is where Chief Smith sat and the desk to the right was given to me.  My desk sat against a wall which on the other side of the wall was a closet.  Behind the other desk were a row of filing cabinets and a window.  The office was small.  My duty was to efile tickets with the clerk of court, check Iowa Courts Online to check on updates to cases, keep a log of calls for service and logs of citations/warnings that are issued, fill out warrants, assist with reports, all the paperwork for the office basically.  All of this was explained to me as I started working.  I got paid for what I did.  The first few days I was shown how to do all this, then I was expected to do it all by myself.  While being shown by Chief Smith, he kept referring to me as his, ‘minion’.  I asked him why he kept saying that, and he stated that all his employee’s, officers or not, were his minions who did anything and everything he asked of us.  I worked in the office every day and rode almost everyday too.

Then came for our first search warrant.  We conducted an investigation and filled out a search warrant.  We made contact with the local Sheriff's Office and several deputies met us at the office.  As the Chief gave a rundown with Bob and the deputies of what was going to happen, I grabbed an inventory sheet to keep record of anything we found.  We then drove to the trailer court.  Chief Smith knocked on the trailer and a female, we will call Nancy, opened the door.  She was presented the search warrant and read it.  I, with Bob, entered the trailer.  None of our officers had body cameras on for the departments were not up to date with modern technology, you could say.

We did a search of the trailer and discovered narcotics.  I noted everything we recovered, made a receipt for everything, and presented it to Nancy before she was handcuffed and placed in a squad car.  We transported her to the Sheriff’s Office where Nancy was booked into jail.  We completed a criminal complaint affidavit and hung out with the deputies for a while before heading back to the office.  The report writing here sucked.  Chief Smith said he didn't want long reports, and just to note what happened.  He always said the extra details aren't required, for in fact this was a small town department.  He ridiculed Dan and other previous police officers stating that they would write reports 5+ pages long for no reason when they just need to note the facts and that’s it.

Then a few days later, I learned of two other people in town we will name Dave and Angela.  Dave I got to know for he was suspected of being a drug dealer as Angela was his girlfriend, who also was a meth user.  We constantly conducted surveillance at their residence in town, sometimes sitting down the road with binoculars.  We worked day and night to catch them, but to this day their drug operation hasn’t been caught.  So I went upon my usual business, showing up everyday and doing paperwork.  I also helped here and there with sitting in my personal vehicle and watching houses or calling if cars left.  This one time I sat outside the trailer court waiting for a truck to leave.  Sure enough it did and I followed it while calling Chief Smith.  He flew around me and stopped the vehicle.  The driver was suspected of having methamphetamines in his possession and consented to a search, which turned up nothing, and was issued a citation for not having a valid driver’s license.  In another instance we heard a sex offender may have been driving with methamphetamines in his truck.  We learned that his registration was expired so I rode with Chief Smith.  We knew what time he got off work and how long it took to get to town from there, so we waited on the west end of town, and sure enough, he passed us.  Chief Smith conducted a traffic stop, and got consent to search the truck.  No narcotics were found, so the driver was issued a citation for operating a non-registered vehicle.  Drugs were a big thing in town.  The citizens didn’t want it, and knew we had a problem. It was the promise of the Chief to clean the town up, putting part of the blame of the drug problem on the former Chief, Dan, stating he was helping the drug dealers and users from getting caught; an accusation I never believed and always will argue.

Then came the day we learned of a couple in town that were doing meth.  We received the information and then planned a garbage rip.  (For those of you who do not know, a garbage rip is where officers come by and take your garbage to search it.  Garbage is considered abandoned property.)  We got in the Chief's personal truck and stopped by city hall to pick up a garbage can that was full.  We threw it into the truck bed and took off for this address.  As we passed the house, we tossed the full garbage can right next to the one out front and threw the garbage can we wanted into the truck bed.  We then retreated to the Chief's house where we laid the garbage in his garage and went through it.  We collected mail with the suspect’s names, who we will call as Leo and Amy (to protect identity).  We found baggies and other narcotics related items that tested positive, with field testing kits, for marijuana and meth.  I took photos of all this and then filled out a search warrant affidavit.  We drove to the judge’s house and got presented it to him.  After getting the warrant signed, we made a game plan to search the house.  We called the deputies and planned to hit it at night, when the family was sleeping.

Finally the time came.  We all pulled up in front of the house.  One of the deputies went around back, as another covered the security camera at the front door.  Chief Smith pounded on the front door until Leo answered.  He was detained as he was read the warrant.  Deputies located Amy and detained her as well outside as another watched the children.  Bob and I entered the house and started searching.  I carried evidence bags and wore gloves and ended up filling bags full of narcotic related items.  Also 6 firearms were seized from the residence as well as the camera, for they were used in commission with the narcotics.  I inventoried all items and made a receipt.  As I issued the receipt, Chief Smith spoke to Leo and Amy and told them they would not be arrested, but charges were pending.  He told them that they were looking at serious charges and serious jail time.  He told them that if they gave up information on who gave them the narcotics, then they would only be charged with misdemeanor possession, before we all left.

To my surprise the next day I discovered Chief Smith in contact with the federal prosecutor trying to press charges on Leo and Amy.  Chief Smith stated that since they did not give him the information then they would be charged federally for being prohibited people in possession of firearms (drug users possessing guns, and having firearms in the presence of narcotics) and that sentence carried 10 or more years in federal prison.  Chief Smith even went back over to interview to Leo and Amy and they confessed they regularly used marijuana and methamphetamine.  Those statements were also forwarded to the federal prosecutor.  Then came the day we transported 7 firearms (6 from this case) to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) in Iowa City.  We handed all the firearms to them for they needed information from them for cases.  Meeting them was an honor because I hadn’t ever met a federal agent before and to my surprise, looked different than I imagined.  But handing these guns over was the final nail in the coffin per say for the federal charges.  They were now set in stone.  Now all we had to do was wait for a grand jury to indict the couple.

A week passed by and Chief Smith brought up the idea of hiring me on as a reserve officer since I was doing such a good job.  I was excited so I excited I had butterflies in my stomach.  I would have to be an idiot to say no, since this was the day I was hoping and praying for, so I said yes.  We filled out the paperwork and set up a time for the city council to interview me.  And just like that the day came.  I attended the city council meeting.  My older distant cousin, Larry, was at the meeting for he was the city clerk.  He had previously told me that I would do great, but still I was nervous when they called me up.

I had previously for over the past year been working as an ambulance driver for the EMS service, so I knew I had that going for me.  When I sat down, Jeff, who was my father’s friend, asked me a few questions as well as Roger, my fathers other friend, did too.  I knew every member on the city council, and one of them I served with on the EMS service with.  I answered the questions, and just like that it was over.  The city council took a vote and they all voted me to be appointed.  I was now a reserve officer.  I met with Chief Smith who finished the paperwork that we faxed to the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA).  We waited for a response.

I began to ride around with Bob while he was on duty the days he worked, for Bob was in his early twenties, like me.  I got a long with Bob just fine and became friends with him, although the only downfall is he would tell everything about me to Chief Smith; for Bob admired Chief Smith and Chief Smith always stated that he was preparing Bob to be the next Chief of Police.  There wasn’t an order Chief Smith could ever say that Bob wouldn’t follow.  Anyway few weeks later, Leo and his mother stopped by the police department and dropped off a piece of paper that listed named of drug dealers and people involved in drugs from miles around the area.  Chief Smith interviewed Leo and got all the information he needed.  I asked Chief Smith if we were going to drop the federal charges and file local charges against Leo and Amy, for they had kept their end of the deal.  The response I received was, ""fuck no"".  Chief Smith began to explain that he intended to have them charged federally from the beginning whether or not they helped.  Them helping was just the icing on the cake.  And sure enough exactly one day before I got the go ahead to start working, we received the federal arrest warrants for Leo and Amy.  Chief Smith ordered me to be at the office early in the morning so we could pick them up before Amy left to the school for work, for she was a school teacher.

We arrived at their house bright and early as the sun rose over the horizon.  It was just me and Chief Smith.  He knocked on the door until Leo answered.  Obviously half asleep, Leo was already pissed off that someone was at his door so early.  Chief Smith presented the federal arrest warrant and ordered Leo to call his mother to take the children.  Leo called for Amy before he collapsed to the ground crying. Amy rushed to the door and began arguing, stating the promise the Chief made if they kept their end of the deal.  Chief Smith lied and said there was nothing he could do and said if he didn't take them into custody a federal tactical team would have to be called and a big scene on the block would be publically made.  With that Amy vomited all over the driveway.  Eventually Leo's mother showed and took the children.  Leo and Amy were placed in the back of the 2016 explorer and we took off.  Because the dash cam had no audio, because it was a cheap brand, we could say whatever we wanted on the trip.  Small talk was made the whole trip to Cedar Rapids.  As we approached the federal courthouse, Chief Smith slipped 2 pairs of handcuffs to the back and ordered the couple to place them on each other for they were now under arrest.  We pulled into the sally port and let the couple out.  Federal agents opened a steel door and came out.  They removed Chief Smith's handcuffs and returned them to him before placing Leo and Amy in shackles.  They were escorted inside to holding cells.  This was the last time I saw them.

The next day I was issued a uniform shirt and badge.  Since I had already ordered a duty belt, but it wasn't yet here, I wore a regular belt.  Chief Smith let me drive the squad car this day and I practiced making traffic stops.  Since the sheriff didn't issue a badge number for me yet, I could not use the radio; Chief Smith had to reach over and use it for me.  I was ordered that any calls that came in I had to call Chief Smith, notify him of the call, and then follow the orders he told me for how to handle it.  Finally my duty belt arrived, but to my surprise, I wasn’t allowed to carry a firearm.  I had one to use, but Chief Smith wasn’t able to (so he says; I believe he was just lazy and didn’t want to) get me put through the ILEA firearms course.  If I couldn’t shoot and pass the course, I couldn’t carry a gun.  So Chief Smith had me in the future work by myself without a firearm, and yes people made fun of me all the time even as far as to call me worse than Barney Fife.  Some farmers at the gas station even offered me to give me one bullet to put in my shirt pocket.

The officer on duty usually worked from 10 AM to 6 PM and then Chief Smith would take over and patrol till the bars closed and then go home.  So between 3 AM and 10 AM, usually there was no officer out patrolling town.  After being out early in the morning for weeks, I began to notice an odd vehicle driving around town.  It was an old dodge pickup missing a tailgate that drove slow around the neighborhoods.  I noted the plate and called dispatch to have the plate ran.  Dispatch ran the plate and it returned to a man (who unfortunately passed away in late 2016) named F. who was barred from driving.  I immediately reported my findings to Chief Smith.  His response though shocked me.  He told me to let it go, saying that F. was an older man who was having health problems and would probably die soon.  I told Chief Smith that F. having health problems was more reason to get him off the road in the event he had a heart attack while driving.  Chief Smith ordered me to forget that I ever saw him driving and to drop the subject.  Tension began to build between us, but I let it go and followed my orders.

As I came to work every week, I began to notice a trend of the city council wanting to meet in the police department alone with the chief.  It was not all members, but usually the same ones, and sometimes the mayor was involved too.  If I happen to show up during one of these ‘meetings’ I would be asked to leave and come back later.  If I was in the office working at the time they showed up for these meetings, I would be asked to go home for the night or to come back sometime else.  I was never allowed to hear what went on during these closed door meetings. 

After a few days, while riding with Chief Smith, we received a call about a fight in progress up the road from the police department.  Chief Smith handed me keys to the other squad car and told me to follow him there.  I was excited to be able to fly several blocks with the emergency lights flashing and siren blaring.  We arrived and found several people outside yelling.  Chief Smith immediately handcuffed a combative suspect and put him into my squad car.  Chief Smith learned of what was going on and ended up arresting a female, the arrested male’s wife, and put her in my squad car too; while he arrested an old high school classmate of mine named George (real name changed to protect identity).  Chief Smith placed George in his squad car.  I finally was able to use a random badge number to call in that I was en-route to the jail.   We booked all 3 suspects in for disorderly conduct-fighting in public.  The mayor congratulated us on the arrest when we got back to town.  I ended up just using that badge number as my own and since I had a badge number now I could patrol all on my own…still without a firearm though.

One of the best places I loved to sit to catch traffic violators was right in the police department parking out front of city hall.  It faced the four-way stop intersection in town, and I could run stationary radar for people coming in and out of town in front of and behind me.  As I was sitting watching for violators one night, I observed a white Oldsmobile come northbound approaching the four-way stop intersection.  The vehicle tapped the brakes then proceeded through the intersection without slowing down.  Upon witnessing the violation, I activated the light bar and sped up to the vehicle.  Ironically the vehicle turned onto the street I lived on and stopped dead in the middle of the road in front of my house.  I walked up and made contact with the driver, we will call Brittaney.  I immediately detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from the vehicle.  I asked Brittaney why she ran the stop sign and she began to argue that she did not.  I asked Brittaney where she was going and she told me home.  That made no sense to me for she lived south of town, the direction she was coming from, not going.  I told Brittaney that she wasn’t making sense and asked where she was coming from.  She was not able to tell me but instead kept repeating, ‘Um, um’.  I then asked Brittaney for her driver’s license.  Brittaney handed me a credit card and when I told my observation to Brittaney, she, while looking at the credit card, began arguing with me that it was her driver’s license.  I proceeded to call Chief Smith and request him to come down to conduct a sobriety test with Brittaney.  The response I got shocked me.  Chief Smith told me to let her go.  He told me she was popular in town and related to the mayor and city council and could not risk getting an OWI (Operating While Intoxicated) charge.  I tried arguing with Chief Smith, but this time he gave an order.  I had no choice.  I handed Brittaney her credit card back and told issued her a citation for failing to stop at a stop sign.

Then came the shocker.  The next day we all met at the police department for a meeting.  During the meeting Chief Smith ordered us all, during the hours of 2 AM to 2:30 AM, to be on the other side of town away from the bar and I quote, “so the drunks can make it home.  This is a small town, they don’t have to drive far.  If they get into an accident then you can arrest them.”  I was shocked to hear this and Chief Smith made it known that this order came down after I stopped Brittaney the night before.  Chief Smith stated that the bar funded the city and police department and that they city could not afford to scare off patrons by us arresting them for OWI.  Then came the threats.  Immediately after Chief Smith noted my ‘subordination’ towards his orders.  Chief Smith told all of us not to cross him.  Chief Smith told us that as long as we stuck to the orders he gave, then we would have a lasting career.  But if we, and I quote “back stab me or my department, I will end your career as quickly as I started it.”  Chief Smith went on further to explain to us how a few years ago a sheriff deputy from the county just north of us, contacted the state about his sheriff.  The sheriff found out and fired the deputy on a technicality in the policy and to this day calls up places this deputy tries to apply at and says nothing but bad things about the deputy to keep the deputy from working anywhere the sheriff doesn’t want him to work.  Chief Smith stated he wouldn’t hesitate to do the same, stating he will call every department we try and apply at and say nothing but bad stuff about us.  Chief Smith stated that we were his minions and we were to do everything he asked of us.  This meeting really made me think about leaving the department after I found out what the city was actually like.  But regardless I agreed to obey and planned to keep my head down.

The next night I showed up to the police department to find a meeting taking place.  I could hear talking through the door, but could not figure out what was being said.  I left and came back later to find everyone leaving.  Chief Smith was inside and when I sat at my desk he asked if there was a problem at all.  I stated there wasn’t.  Chief Smith proceeded to tell me if I ever chose to go against him or his department that he would keep me from being an officer again in this state by calling any department I worked for to tell them I was a dishonest officer.  He stated if my integrity ever gets put in question, I could never be an officer again in my life.  I wouldn’t be able to testify again in court because they wouldn’t be able to trust me.  Chief Smith said he didn’t want to do that to me and that’s why I needed to follow his orders.  He told me to be more like Bob for Bob never asks questions when he’s given an order.  Chief Smith even told me that Bob was in line next to become Chief, for he, the mayor, and city council have it planned for when Chief Smith retires.    

But even though Bob follows orders without questions and does what he can and all that, Chief Smith still talked shit about him behind Bob’s back.  See, Bob had gotten a girlfriend while employed as an officer.  She was a badge bunny who loved a man in uniform.  Bob had gotten lazy, sometimes not showing up for work on time for me was with his girlfriend when he was supposed to be on duty.  One day I got called by a deputy asking me to stop by Bob’s house and notify him that dispatch had been calling him on the radio over and over with no response.  Sure enough when I stopped by I found a half clothed Bob inside telling me he was with his girlfriend.  I told him to answer the damn radio before I left.  The deputies frequently stopped by the police department and we all made fun of Bob.  Bob never knew about it and because he was an ass towards me, I never told him. 

During my time patrolling town, I began to know people well from taking calls at their residence, or just seeing them all the time.  There was one couple I began to know well for their dog always got loose.  The males name was Derrick.  I gave him my number to call me the next time the dog got loose.  Well one night I got a call.  It was Derrick’s letting me know Derrick was drunk and feeling suicidal.  I called Bob and was trying to tell him, but Bob said he was dealing with a lost dog.  I then went to Derrick’s house.  I called our town paramedic and asked him to evaluate Derrick.  Sure enough our paramedic did and called dispatch to have the ambulance paged.  I drove to the fire station where the ambulance was stored and met everyone there.  We returned and loaded Derrick in and transported him to the hospital to get mental health help. 

Since it was my days off, I returned to the police department when I worked next.  When I returned, and was working on the computer, Chief Smith and Bob stormed in slamming the door shut.  They began to chew my ass for calling the ambulance.  I told them the situation and in response this is what Chief Smith told me I should have done.  He said I should have called Derrick to the sidewalk, and once he was on the sidewalk to place Derrick under arrest for public intoxication.  I explained that Derrick did not need to go to jail but instead needed mental health help.  Chief Smith bridled me about it.  He then stated I had caused ‘enough drama’ to the city.  I had no idea what he was talking about.  Bob then stated that I hadn’t spoken to anyone from the city (no officers, city councilmen, or the mayor) for two days and that I was causing drama by running away for two days.  I had no words to say.  I could not believe they were starting a bunch of bullshit.  I explained that I was on my days off and on my days off, just like them, I stay in my house and watch TV/play videogames.  I was then told since I had started drama with the city and was continuing it and arguing instead of apologizing (there was nothing to apologize about) I would be cut days to work.  Bob was going to work 5 of my days for me.  I could not believe this.  Once they left I the next day went to Chief Smith’s house and apologized (even though I did nothing wrong) for causing drama.  He allowed me to work 2 of the days he gave to Bob.  That’s when I was also told that we would no longer be meeting at the police department for meetings for the city had installed surveillance cameras and audio in city hall.  Chief Smith didn’t want anything we talked about to be recorded so we always had meetings at his house instead.

Chief Smith I believed loved being in control and that’s why he acted this way.  I believe he’s a control freak.  He always yelled at his girlfriend for things she couldn’t do or help.  He treated her like shit.  I even believe he hit her when no one was around.  One day, while riding, we showed up to Chief Smith’s house.  His girlfriend showed up at the same time.  Bill walked inside and asked where supper was.  His girlfriend said she just got home and didn’t have time to make supper.  Bill began to shout and I saw his girlfriend flinch as if she was waiting to get hit.  She began to whisper as she apologized for not having supper ready.  Bill started cooking and made his own supper.  He ate, said good-bye, and we went on patrol.  He then started telling me how useless his girlfriend was for not having supper ready.

In another instance, Dan had returned to town to work on one of several rental properties he owns.  When I was out patrolling and saw his car outside the house, I stopped over.  I stopped in and showed him that I was a town officer now.  While I was visiting him though, a friend of Chief Smith’s saw me there and took a photo of me talking to Dan.  Later that day, while in the office, Chief Smith came in and sat at his desk.  He began to bridle me asking what I was doing talking to Dan.  I told him I was friends with Dan still and I wanted to say Hi.  Chief Smith was furious stating that as long as I was an officer of his, I would under no circumstances talk with the previous police chief.  Chief Smith claimed that Dan had been in the pockets of people who were doing drugs in town (accusations with no proof) stating that Dan would tip drug dealers off whenever the county was gonna do a search warrant.  He stated either I was an officer of his, or a traitor.  I told Chief Smith that I was keeping the peace between Dan and the police department.  That seemed to calm him down, but I was warned not to be friends with Dan anymore or I wouldn’t be an officer long.

Then came the day we made the town newspaper.  We received a search warrant for George’s house.  We knew we would get some marijuana and maybe not much more; but what we found shocked the city.  Upon making entry to the residence, we located a safe that contained over $2,000 cash and several huge vacuumed sealed bags of marijuana as other narcotics related materials and a firearm.  We confiscated everything and transported George and his friend to the county jail.  George was charged with several felonies and held on a high bond.  George, as he was being led away, made a comment to us all asking us how we thought of him selling marijuana to kids all across town.  He was the drug dealer we were looking for but didn’t know of.  Later on after we got all the evidence collected, we set it on the city council table at city hall and got our picture taken with it.  Me, Bob, and Chief Smith were all in the photo.  We could have filed federal charges, but decided not to.  In the end Chief Smith worked out a deal with the county attorney, and it was that George would plead Guilty to 1 felony charge and all the rest would be dropped, but at any time day or night the police could search the house without probable cause or a warrant.  George agreed to stay out of prison.  Chief Smith had that deal made because he intended to catch George again.  George had family that showed up every so often from Colorado and they would being George the bags of marijuana.  I did feel bad for the situation George got himself into for I was friends with him before all this happened.

Then was the time they made an embarrassment of me.  I was out patrolling and turned around at Chief Smith’s house to pick up a ride along (the person who eventually replaced me as an officer).  While turning around, a car with Minnesota plates and tinted windows flew past me at a high rate of speed.  I then turned around and took off in the direction it was traveling in.  While driving on the road that is on the city limit line (previously stated at the beginning) the car approached me.  This road was a 25 MPH zone and when I clicked on my forward facing moving radar, I received a speed calculation of 52 MPH.  I flipped on the emergency lights and siren as the car passed me and turned around and accelerated towards it.  As I flew onto the main road into town, I checked for traffic and flew through the stop sign intersection and onto the road at 60 MPH.  I came to the edge of the cemetery where the road curved into town and couldn’t see the car anywhere.  I was going 80+MPH and I knew the car had to be going faster than me to disappear like that.  I called it in to dispatch and they called an Attempt to Locate on the car for the deputies and the surrounding counties.  Then Chief Smith called and asked me to stop to his house.  When I showed up, there was the car.  Chief Smith and Bob were having fun with Chief Smith’s new car.  Then Cory called.  He was working as an officer in the next county and heard about the car I was trying to stop.  Chief Smith then became mad.  He called the sheriff’s office and told them he was doing pursuit training with me and forgot to notify me.  He told them to cancel the attempt to locate on his car.  He then told me and Bob that we have a no pursuit policy and not to chase after cars.  Finally the last straw with Chief Smith happened.  I was patrolling town when Dave flagged me down.  I pulled over and Dave pulled up next to me.  He stated that his girlfriend was freaking out at the house.  I went over and called Chief Smith, per my orders.  He stated he was on his way over and not to notify dispatch about anything yet.  He said he was ten minutes out.  I went inside and found Angela yelling at Dave and crying.  Dave was yelling back.  I was in the process of splitting the couple up when I observed Angela’s eyes roll back and she fell face first to the floor and started seizing up.  Since I had already worked hospital security and seen seizures, this is exactly what I had seen in the Emergency Room.  I asked Dave how often this happens and he told me lately it’s been happening a lot.  I got down and helped Angela.  Angela got up after a few minutes and I ordered Dave to call 911 next time it happened.  About that time Chief Smith showed up.  I immediately told him what I witnessed and told him I was gonna call for the ambulance.  Chief Smith shouted, “no”.  He told me he would handle it and ordered me to go home.  I did so.  The next day I went to Chief Smith’s house to pick up his squad car for Bob had the one we drove.  Inside I asked Chief Smith if he called EMS for Angela.  Immediately he started yelling at me telling me to forget that anything happened.  He yelled, “You’re not a fucking doctor, you can’t diagnose that she had a fucking seizure!”  Chief Smith stated that if she did have a seizure, it would be a miracle of God for that meth addict to die for she was a waste of oxygen.  I was then told I was done working until I decided to “be a team player” and that Bob was going to get my hours.  I was told that if I didn’t want to follow orders I didn’t have to work anymore.  A few days later I again went back and apologized (again for no reason) for my actions and got my working days back.

On the next days off I drove to a friend house, who was an officer in another county, and stayed the night there.  While staying the night, I received a text from Bob, who asked me if the city had to hire someone to replace me.  I sent back a message asking what that meant and immediately received a call from Cory.  He told me that Chief Smith was furious at me and that I was permanently off the schedule unless I went and again apologized (for again no reason) to the chief.  I asked him what I did wrong and he said he had no clue other than the chief was furious at me.  This was the end of the line.  I got the number for the Iowa Ombudsman’s Office and called them.  I had kept 16 pages of notes in a notebook with all these activities and more with dates and times.  I explained everything.  The lady I spoke to told me to quit form that department.  She told me they were doing shady practices and they would look into it, but it was her advice for me to quit.  I took her advice.  My friend and I went back to town and I gathered all my stuff up.  I turned it in to one of the city council members with a resignation letter I typed up quick.  I also had to quickly explain to my parents what happened in a quick 5 minuet explanation as to why I was quitting and moving away.  I blocked the phone numbers of Bob and Chief Smith.  Later on that day, I kept getting voicemails from Chief Smith stating it wasn’t too late to come back and apologize and get a few hours of work here and there.  Then more voicemails asking if I really wanted to end my career.  Finally I received the last one stating if I didn’t call him back that there would be nothing I could do to earn my job back and my career would be over.  I never called him back and how have a new phone and number.

I had intentions of working at the department I am at now.  Chief Smith the next day after leaving the voicemails called the city hall where I am living now, and told them I was liar, my integrity was up for question, and that I could not be trusted.  He tried to spread false lies about me but luckily the city I am at now doesn’t put up with shady departments.  They hung up the phone and told him not to call back.  I did however have one court date left at this old department.  I didn’t want to be alone with Chief Smith so I decided to have my father attend court with me.  We met at the courthouse and waited outside the courtroom.  Sure enough Chief Smith showed up.  He looked at me and my father before retreating to another part of the courthouse.  That’s when I was notified that I wasn’t needed because the defendant had plead Guilty of the charges that morning and a trial was no longer needed.  My father and I left without anything but exchanging looks with Chief Smith.    Surprisingly my cousin one day after my resignation, too quit, retiring early after a whole career of being city clerk.  It was odd that he did this one day after I quit working for the city.

The last thing that ever happened with his department was during the city council meeting, where they discussed my immediate resignation form the police department and EMS service, my father stood in front of the city council and confronted Chief Smith for the way I was treated.  I had no idea he was doing this, but they ended the city council sessions, asked the members of the public to leave as well as the news reporter, and conducted a closed session meeting.  There my father laid out the truth to the city council about what was going on with the department.  The city council members argued with my father as Chief Smith accused me of gossiping and spreading lies.  Roger was the only city council member that believed what I was saying and even fought for me amongst the other council members.  He forever has my respect.  He was one that did not participate in the ‘secret meetings’ the other members did with the chief.  Once the council meeting was over, I then set up a time to meet with the mayor and lay down to him myself what was going on.  Once leaving the mayors church, I planned to cut communication from this city and forget I am even from here.  I am ashamed to say that I grew up in a town that doesn’t even fight for its own.

\--Side note:  The Ombudsman's Office sent me an email basically stating that they cannot legally do anything about this department because technically no laws were broken because no one died.  I was asked to forward my complaints to the city administration aka the city council...who we all know won'd do a damn thing.",09Jan2019,1

I grew up in a small town with a population of just under 1,400 people.  It’s just over a mile in all directions and is half surrounded by a river.  A set of railroad tracks (former Rock Island Railroad) also surrounds half the city and a siding (former Chicago and North Western Railroad) cuts the city in half extending through town.  The city has 2 bars, 2 parks, one state park at the south end of town across the tracks, a rural volunteer fire department, a volunteer EMS service (which seems to service the county), a small grocery store, and small meat locker.  It's an everybody knows everybody town.  I grew up on a street that the city limits run on; with me having to live in the county side.  If I had to call 911 for an emergency, the Sheriff's Office had to respond.  Not much happened in the city as far as serious crime went. 

Growing up my father was friends with the Chief of Police named Dan.  Dan was a great guy teaching me all about law enforcement, keeping me on the straight and narrow, and even letting me ride along with him to see the job of a police officer.  He worked hard for many years keeping the city free of crime.  I began to enjoy talking with Dan and wanted to become a police officer myself, working as Dan’s officer.  I eventually moved into town.  Then came the day Dan had made his resignation from Chief of Police public stating he was resigning after being chief for over 10+ years.  He was moving to another Chief position in a bigger city that paid more.  Once Dan resigned and moved away, the officer at that time, let’s call him Bill Smith, was appointed Chief of Police by a newly elected City Council.  Chief Smith was in his fifties, and after being fired from another department for sleeping on duty in a squad car, moved to our small town to be an officer and get away from the previous department to somewhere where no one knows him.  Since the city had no full time officers at the time, Bill hired on an officer named Cory and another, we will call Bob.  Bob was hired to be full time while Cory was a reserve officer.  (As a side note Bob wasn’t able to pass the physical fitness test at the ILEA and had to be put down as a police reserve too, until recently.  He now is able to work full time as an officer because he is a full time EMT now.  He wears a uniform and drives the squad car in the downtime of no ambulance calls.)

Now this is where I come in to the picture.  See, I was attending college for law enforcement and got the opportunity to intern with the police department.  I was as excited as a kid at the carnival.  I was hoping to be able to fulfill my dream of becoming a city officer, for I grew up wanting to work as a cop in my hometown.  So I took the opportunity and said yes to the internship.  I showed up almost everyday and rode with Chief Smith as well.

Now if you walked into City Hall, immediately inside the first set of doors to the left is the wooden door to the police department.  Inside the police department were 2 desks.  The desk to the left is where Chief Smith sat and the desk to the right was given to me.  My desk sat against a wall which on the other side of the wall was a closet.  Behind the other desk were a row of filing cabinets and a window.  The office was small.  My duty was to efile tickets with the clerk of court, check Iowa Courts Online to check on updates to cases, keep a log of calls for service and logs of citations/warnings that are issued, fill out warrants, assist with reports, all the paperwork for the office basically.  All of this was explained to me as I started working.  I got paid for what I did.  The first few days I was shown how to do all this, then I was expected to do it all by myself.  While being shown by Chief Smith, he kept referring to me as his, ‘minion’.  I asked him why he kept saying that, and he stated that all his employee’s, officers or not, were his minions who did anything and everything he asked of us.  I worked in the office every day and rode almost everyday too.

Then came for our first search warrant.  We conducted an investigation and filled out a search warrant.  We made contact with the local Sheriff's Office and several deputies met us at the office.  As the Chief gave a rundown with Bob and the deputies of what was going to happen, I grabbed an inventory sheet to keep record of anything we found.  We then drove to the trailer court.  Chief Smith knocked on the trailer and a female, we will call Nancy, opened the door.  She was presented the search warrant and read it.  I, with Bob, entered the trailer.  None of our officers had body cameras on for the departments were not up to date with modern technology, you could say.

We did a search of the trailer and discovered narcotics.  I noted everything we recovered, made a receipt for everything, and presented it to Nancy before she was handcuffed and placed in a squad car.  We transported her to the Sheriff’s Office where Nancy was booked into jail.  We completed a criminal complaint affidavit and hung out with the deputies for a while before heading back to the office.  The report writing here sucked.  Chief Smith said he didn't want long reports, and just to note what happened.  He always said the extra details aren't required, for in fact this was a small town department.  He ridiculed Dan and other previous police officers stating that they would write reports 5+ pages long for no reason when they just need to note the facts and that’s it.

Then a few days later, I learned of two other people in town we will name Dave and Angela.  Dave I got to know for he was suspected of being a drug dealer as Angela was his girlfriend, who also was a meth user.  We constantly conducted surveillance at their residence in town, sometimes sitting down the road with binoculars.  We worked day and night to catch them, but to this day their drug operation hasn’t been caught.  So I went upon my usual business, showing up everyday and doing paperwork.  I also helped here and there with sitting in my personal vehicle and watching houses or calling if cars left.  This one time I sat outside the trailer court waiting for a truck to leave.  Sure enough it did and I followed it while calling Chief Smith.  He flew around me and stopped the vehicle.  The driver was suspected of having methamphetamines in his possession and consented to a search, which turned up nothing, and was issued a citation for not having a valid driver’s license.  In another instance we heard a sex offender may have been driving with methamphetamines in his truck.  We learned that his registration was expired so I rode with Chief Smith.  We knew what time he got off work and how long it took to get to town from there, so we waited on the west end of town, and sure enough, he passed us.  Chief Smith conducted a traffic stop, and got consent to search the truck.  No narcotics were found, so the driver was issued a citation for operating a non-registered vehicle.  Drugs were a big thing in town.  The citizens didn’t want it, and knew we had a problem. It was the promise of the Chief to clean the town up, putting part of the blame of the drug problem on the former Chief, Dan, stating he was helping the drug dealers and users from getting caught; an accusation I never believed and always will argue.

Then came the day we learned of a couple in town that were doing meth.  We received the information and then planned a garbage rip.  (For those of you who do not know, a garbage rip is where officers come by and take your garbage to search it.  Garbage is considered abandoned property.)  We got in the Chief's personal truck and stopped by city hall to pick up a garbage can that was full.  We threw it into the truck bed and took off for this address.  As we passed the house, we tossed the full garbage can right next to the one out front and threw the garbage can we wanted into the truck bed.  We then retreated to the Chief's house where we laid the garbage in his garage and went through it.  We collected mail with the suspect’s names, who we will call as Leo and Amy (to protect identity).  We found baggies and other narcotics related items that tested positive, with field testing kits, for marijuana and meth.  I took photos of all this and then filled out a search warrant affidavit.  We drove to the judge’s house and presented it to him.  After getting the warrant signed, we made a game plan to search the house.  We called the deputies and planned to hit it at night, when the family was sleeping.

Finally the time came.  We all pulled up in front of the house.  One of the deputies went around back, as another covered the security camera at the front door.  Chief Smith pounded on the front door until Leo answered.  He was detained as he was read the warrant.  Deputies located Amy and detained her as well outside as another watched the children.  Bob and I entered the house and started searching.  I carried evidence bags and wore gloves and ended up filling bags full of narcotic related items.  Also 6 firearms were seized from the residence as well as the camera, for they were used in commission with the narcotics.  I inventoried all items and made a receipt.  As I issued the receipt, Chief Smith spoke to Leo and Amy and told them they would not be arrested, but charges were pending.  He told them that they were looking at serious charges and serious jail time.  He told them that if they gave up information on who gave them the narcotics, then they would only be charged with misdemeanor possession, before we all left.

To my surprise the next day I discovered Chief Smith in contact with the federal prosecutor trying to press charges on Leo and Amy.  Chief Smith stated that since they did not give him the information then they would be charged federally for being prohibited people in possession of firearms (drug users possessing guns, and having firearms in the presence of narcotics) and that sentence carried 10 or more years in federal prison.  Chief Smith even went back over to interview to Leo and Amy and they confessed they regularly used marijuana and methamphetamine.  Those statements were also forwarded to the federal prosecutor.  Then came the day we transported 7 firearms (6 from this case) to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) in Iowa City.  We handed all the firearms to them for they needed information from them for cases.  Meeting them was an honor because I hadn’t ever met a federal agent before and to my surprise, looked different than I imagined.  But handing these guns over was the final nail in the coffin per say for the federal charges.  They were now set in stone.  Now all we had to do was wait for a grand jury to indict the couple.

A week passed by and Chief Smith brought up the idea of hiring me on as a reserve officer since I was doing such a good job.  I was so excited I had butterflies in my stomach.  I would have to be an idiot to say no, since this was the day I was hoping and praying for, so I said yes.  We filled out the paperwork and set up a time for the city council to interview me.  And just like that the day came.  I attended the city council meeting.  My older distant cousin, Larry, was at the meeting for he was the city clerk.  He had previously told me that I would do great, but still I was nervous when they called me up.

I had previously for over the past year been working as an ambulance driver for the EMS service, so I knew I had that going for me.  When I sat down, Jeff, who was my father’s friend, asked me a few questions as well as Roger, my fathers other friend, did too.  I knew every member on the city council, and one of them I served with on the EMS service with.  I answered the questions, and just like that it was over.  The city council took a vote and they all voted me to be appointed.  I was now a reserve officer.  I met with Chief Smith who finished the paperwork that we faxed to the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA).  We waited for a response.

I began to ride around with Bob while he was on duty the days he worked, for Bob was in his early twenties, like me.  I got a long with Bob just fine and became friends with him, although the only downfall is he would tell everything about me to Chief Smith; for Bob admired Chief Smith and Chief Smith always stated that he was preparing Bob to be the next Chief of Police.  There wasn’t an order Chief Smith could ever say that Bob wouldn’t follow.  Anyway few weeks later, Leo and his mother stopped by the police department and dropped off a piece of paper that listed named of drug dealers and people involved in drugs from miles around the area.  Chief Smith interviewed Leo and got all the information he needed.  I asked Chief Smith if we were going to drop the federal charges and file local charges against Leo and Amy, for they had kept their end of the deal.  The response I received was, ""fuck no"".  Chief Smith began to explain that he intended to have them charged federally from the beginning whether or not they helped.  Them helping was just the icing on the cake.  And sure enough exactly one day before I got the go ahead to start working, we received the federal arrest warrants for Leo and Amy.  Chief Smith ordered me to be at the office early in the morning so we could pick them up before Amy left to the school for work, for she was a school teacher.

We arrived at their house bright and early as the sun rose over the horizon.  It was just me and Chief Smith.  He knocked on the door until Leo answered.  Obviously half asleep, Leo was already pissed off that someone was at his door so early.  Chief Smith presented the federal arrest warrant and ordered Leo to call his mother to take the children.  Leo called for Amy before he collapsed to the ground crying. Amy rushed to the door and began arguing, stating the promise the Chief made if they kept their end of the deal.  Chief Smith lied and said there was nothing he could do and said if he didn't take them into custody a federal tactical team would have to be called and a big scene on the block would be publically made.  With that Amy vomited all over the driveway.  Eventually Leo's mother showed and took the children.  Leo and Amy were placed in the back of the 2016 explorer and we took off.  Because the dash cam had no audio, because it was a cheap brand, we could say whatever we wanted on the trip.  Small talk was made the whole trip to Cedar Rapids.  As we approached the federal courthouse, Chief Smith slipped 2 pairs of handcuffs to the back and ordered the couple to place them on each other for they were now under arrest.  We pulled into the sally port and let the couple out.  Federal agents opened a steel door and came out.  They removed Chief Smith's handcuffs and returned them to him before placing Leo and Amy in shackles.  They were escorted inside to holding cells.  This was the last time I saw them.

The next day I was issued a uniform shirt and badge.  Since I had already ordered a duty belt, but it wasn't yet here, I wore a regular belt.  Chief Smith let me drive the squad car this day and I practiced making traffic stops.  Since the sheriff didn't issue a badge number for me yet, I could not use the radio; Chief Smith had to reach over and use it for me.  I was ordered that any calls that came in I had to call Chief Smith, notify him of the call, and then follow the orders he told me for how to handle it.  Finally my duty belt arrived, but to my surprise, I wasn’t allowed to carry a firearm.  I had one to use, but Chief Smith wasn’t able to (so he says; I believe he was just lazy and didn’t want to) get me put through the ILEA firearms course.  If I couldn’t shoot and pass the course, I couldn’t carry a gun.  So Chief Smith had me in the future work by myself without a firearm, and yes people made fun of me all the time even as far as to call me worse than Barney Fife.  Some farmers at the gas station even offered me to give me one bullet to put in my shirt pocket.

The officer on duty usually worked from 10 AM to 6 PM and then Chief Smith would take over and patrol till the bars closed and then go home.  So between 3 AM and 10 AM, usually there was no officer out patrolling town.  After being out early in the morning for weeks, I began to notice an odd vehicle driving around town.  It was an old dodge pickup missing a tailgate that drove slow around the neighborhoods.  I noted the plate and called dispatch to have the plate ran.  Dispatch ran the plate and it returned to a man (who unfortunately passed away in late 2016) named F. who was barred from driving.  I immediately reported my findings to Chief Smith.  His response though shocked me.  He told me to let it go, saying that F. was an older man who was having health problems and would probably die soon.  I told Chief Smith that F. having health problems was more reason to get him off the road in the event he had a heart attack while driving.  Chief Smith ordered me to forget that I ever saw him driving and to drop the subject.  Tension began to build between us, but I let it go and followed my orders.

As I came to work every week, I began to notice a trend of the city council wanting to meet in the police department alone with the chief.  It was not all members, but usually the same ones, and sometimes the mayor was involved too.  If I happen to show up during one of these ‘meetings’ I would be asked to leave and come back later.  If I was in the office working at the time they showed up for these meetings, I would be asked to go home for the night or to come back sometime else.  I was never allowed to hear what went on during these closed door meetings. 

After a few days, while riding with Chief Smith, we received a call about a fight in progress up the road from the police department.  Chief Smith handed me keys to the other squad car and told me to follow him there.  I was excited to be able to fly several blocks with the emergency lights flashing and siren blaring.  We arrived and found several people outside yelling.  Chief Smith immediately handcuffed a combative suspect and put him into my squad car.  Chief Smith learned of what was going on and ended up arresting a female, the arrested male’s wife, and put her in my squad car too; while he arrested an old high school classmate of mine named George (real name changed to protect identity).  Chief Smith placed George in his squad car.  I finally was able to use a random badge number to call in that I was en-route to the jail.   We booked all 3 suspects in for disorderly conduct-fighting in public.  The mayor congratulated us on the arrest when we got back to town.  I ended up just using that badge number as my own and since I had a badge number now I could patrol all on my own…still without a firearm though.

One of the best places I loved to sit to catch traffic violators was right in the police department parking out front of city hall.  It faced the four-way stop intersection in town, and I could run stationary radar for people coming in and out of town in front of and behind me.  For a while we were asked to work weird hours, having us working late into the night. As I was sitting watching for violators one night, I observed a white Oldsmobile come northbound approaching the four-way stop intersection.  The vehicle tapped the brakes then proceeded through the intersection without slowing down.  Upon witnessing the violation, I activated the light bar and sped up to the vehicle.  Ironically the vehicle turned onto the street I lived on and stopped dead in the middle of the road in front of my house.  I walked up and made contact with the driver, we will call Brittaney.  I immediately detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from the vehicle.  I asked Brittaney why she ran the stop sign and she began to argue that she did not.  I asked Brittaney where she was going and she told me home.  That made no sense to me for she lived south of town, the direction she was coming from, not going.  I told Brittaney that she wasn’t making sense and asked where she was coming from.  She was not able to tell me but instead kept repeating, ‘Um, um’.  I then asked Brittaney for her driver’s license.  Brittaney handed me a credit card and when I told my observation to Brittaney, she, while looking at the credit card, began arguing with me that it was her driver’s license.  I proceeded to call Chief Smith and request him to come down to conduct a sobriety test with Brittaney.  The response I got shocked me.  Chief Smith told me to let her go.  He told me she was popular in town and related to the mayor and city council and could not risk getting an OWI (Operating While Intoxicated) charge.  I tried arguing with Chief Smith, but this time he gave an order.  I had no choice.  I handed Brittaney her credit card back and issued her a citation for failing to stop at a stop sign.

Then came the shocker.  The next day we all met at the police department for a meeting.  During the meeting Chief Smith ordered us all, during the hours of 2 AM to 2:30 AM, to be on the other side of town away from the bar and I quote, “so the drunks can make it home.  This is a small town, they don’t have to drive far.  If they get into an accident then you can arrest them.”  I was shocked to hear this and Chief Smith made it known that this order came down after I stopped Brittaney the night before.  Chief Smith stated that the bar funded the city and police department and that the city could not afford to scare off patrons by us arresting them for OWI.  Then came the threats.  Immediately after Chief Smith noted my ‘insubordination’ towards his orders.  Chief Smith told all of us not to cross him.  Chief Smith told us that as long as we stuck to the orders he gave, then we would have a lasting career.  But if we, and I quote “back stab me or my department, I will end your career as quickly as I started it.”  Chief Smith went on further to explain to us how a few years ago a sheriff deputy from the county just north of us, contacted the state about his sheriff.  The sheriff found out and fired the deputy on a technicality in the policy and to this day calls up places this deputy tries to apply at and says nothing but bad things about the deputy to keep the deputy from working anywhere the sheriff doesn’t want him to work.  Chief Smith stated he wouldn’t hesitate to do the same, stating he will call every department we try and apply at and say nothing but bad stuff about us.  Chief Smith stated that we were his minions and we were to do everything he asked of us.  This meeting really made me think about leaving the department after I found out what the city was actually like.  But regardless I felt like I had no way of leaving this department so I planned to keep my head down.

The next night I showed up to the police department to find a meeting taking place.  I could hear talking through the door, but could not figure out what was being said.  I left and came back later to find everyone leaving.  Chief Smith was inside and when I sat at my desk he asked if there was a problem at all.  I stated there wasn’t.  Chief Smith proceeded to tell me if I ever chose to go against him or his department that he would keep me from being an officer again in this state by calling any department I worked for to tell them I was a dishonest officer.  He stated if my integrity ever gets put in question, I could never be an officer again in my life.  I wouldn’t be able to testify again in court because they wouldn’t be able to trust me.  Chief Smith said he didn’t want to do that to me and that’s why I needed to follow his orders.  He told me to be more like Bob for Bob never asks questions when he’s given an order.  Chief Smith even told me that Bob was in line next to become Chief, for he, the mayor, and city council have it planned for when Chief Smith retires.    

But even though Bob follows orders without questions asked and does what he can and all that, Chief Smith still talked shit about him behind Bob’s back.  See, Bob had gotten a girlfriend while employed as an officer.  She was a badge bunny who loved a man in uniform.  Bob had gotten lazy, sometimes not showing up for work on time for he was with his girlfriend when he was supposed to be on duty.  One day I got called by a deputy asking me to stop by Bob’s house and notify him that dispatch had been calling him on the radio over and over with no response.  Sure enough when I stopped by I found a half clothed Bob inside telling me he was with his girlfriend.  I told him to answer the damn radio before I left.  The deputies frequently stopped by the police department and we all made fun of Bob.  Bob never knew about it and because he was an ass towards me, I never told him. 

During my time patrolling town, I began to know people well from taking calls at their residence, or just seeing them all the time.  There was one couple I began to know well for their dog always got loose.  The males name was Derrick.  I gave him my number to call me the next time the dog got loose.  Well one night I got a call.  It was Derrick’s wife letting me know Derrick was drunk and feeling suicidal.  I called Bob and was trying to tell him, but Bob said he was dealing with a lost dog.  So I then went to Derrick’s house since Bob wasn't going to be of assistance.  I called our town paramedic and asked him to evaluate Derrick.  Sure enough our paramedic did and called dispatch to have the ambulance paged.  I drove to the fire station where the ambulance was stored and met everyone there.  We returned and loaded Derrick in and transported him to the hospital to get mental health help. 

Since it was my days off, I returned to the police department when I worked next.  When I returned, and was working on the computer, Chief Smith and Bob stormed in slamming the door shut.  They began to chew my ass for calling the ambulance.  I told them the situation and in response this is what Chief Smith told me I should have done.  He said I should have called Derrick to the sidewalk, and once he was on the sidewalk to place Derrick under arrest for public intoxication.  I explained that Derrick did not need to go to jail but instead needed mental health help.  Chief Smith bridled me about it.  He then stated I had caused ‘enough drama’ to the city.  I had no idea what he was talking about.  Bob then stated that I hadn’t spoken to anyone from the city (no officers, city councilmen, or the mayor) for two days and that I was causing drama by running away for two days.  I had no words to say.  I could not believe they were starting a bunch of bullshit.  I explained that I was on my days off and on my days off, just like them, I stay in my house and watch TV/play videogames.  I was then told since I had started drama with the city and was continuing it and arguing instead of apologizing (there was nothing to apologize about) I would be cut days to work.  Bob was going to work 5 of my days for me.  I could not believe this.  Once they left I the next day went to Chief Smith’s house and apologized (even though I did nothing wrong) for causing drama.  He allowed me to work 2 of the days he gave to Bob.  That’s when I was also told that we would no longer be meeting at the police department for meetings for the city had installed surveillance cameras and audio in city hall.  Chief Smith didn’t want anything we talked about to be recorded so we always had meetings at his house instead.

Chief Smith I believed loved being in control and that’s why he acted this way.  I believe he’s a control freak.  He always yelled at his girlfriend for things she couldn’t do or help.  He treated her like shit.  I even believe he hit her when no one was around.  One day, while riding, we showed up to Chief Smith’s house.  His girlfriend showed up at the same time.  Bill walked inside and asked where supper was.  His girlfriend said she just got home and didn’t have time to make supper.  Bill began to shout and I saw his girlfriend flinch as if she was waiting to get hit.  She began to whisper as she apologized for not having supper ready.  Bill started cooking and made his own supper.  He ate, said good-bye, and we went on patrol.  He then started telling me how useless his girlfriend was for not having supper ready.

In another instance, Dan had returned to town to work on one of several rental properties he owns.  When I was out patrolling and saw his car outside the house, I stopped over.  I stopped in and showed him that I was a town officer now.  While I was visiting him though, a friend of Chief Smith’s saw me there and took a photo of me talking to Dan.  Later that day, while in the office, Chief Smith came in and sat at his desk.  He began to bridle me asking what I was doing talking to Dan.  I told him I was friends with Dan still and I wanted to say Hi.  Chief Smith was furious stating that as long as I was an officer of his, I would under no circumstances talk with the previous police chief.  Chief Smith claimed that Dan had been in the pockets of people who were doing drugs in town (accusations with no proof) stating that Dan would tip drug dealers off whenever the county was gonna do a search warrant.  He stated either I was an officer of his, or a traitor.  I told Chief Smith that I was keeping the peace between Dan and the police department.  That seemed to calm him down, but I was warned not to be friends with Dan anymore or I wouldn’t be an officer long.

Then came the day we made the town newspaper.  We received a search warrant for George’s house.  We knew we would get some marijuana and maybe not much more; but what we found shocked the city.  Upon making entry to the residence, we located a safe that contained over $2,000 cash and several huge vacuumed sealed bags of marijuana as well as other narcotics related materials and a firearm.  We confiscated everything and transported George and his friend to the county jail.  George was charged with several felonies and held on a high bond.  George, as he was being led away, made a comment to us all asking us how we thought of him selling marijuana to kids all across town.  He was the drug dealer we were looking for but didn’t know of.  Later on after we got all the evidence collected, we set it on the city council table at city hall and got our picture taken with it.  Me, Bob, and Chief Smith were all in the photo.  We could have filed federal charges, but decided not to.  In the end Chief Smith worked out a deal with the county attorney, and it was that George would plead Guilty to 1 felony charge and all the rest would be dropped with George serving just probation. But the catch was at any time day or night the police could search the house without probable cause or a warrant.  And if something was found he would surely go to prison for 5 years on the charge he plead to and risked more prison time for future charges. George agreed to stay out of prison.  Chief Smith had that deal made because he intended to catch George again.  George had family that showed up every so often from Colorado and they would bring George the bags of marijuana.  I did feel bad for the situation George got himself into for I was friends with him before all this happened.

Then was the time they made an embarrassment of me.  I was out patrolling and turned around at Chief Smith’s house to pick up a ride along (the person who eventually replaced me as an officer).  While turning around, a car with Minnesota plates and tinted windows flew past me at a high rate of speed.  I then turned around and took off in the direction it was traveling in.  While driving on the road that is on the city limit line (previously stated at the beginning) the car approached me.  This road was a 25 MPH zone and when I clicked on my forward facing moving radar, I received a speed calculation of 52 MPH.  I flipped on the emergency lights and siren as the car passed me and turned around and accelerated towards it.  As I flew onto the main road into town, I checked for traffic and flew through the stop sign intersection and onto the road at 60 MPH.  I came to the edge of the cemetery where the road curved into town and couldn’t see the car anywhere.  I was going 80+MPH and I knew the car had to be going faster than me to disappear like that.  I called it in to dispatch and they called an Attempt to Locate on the car for the deputies and the surrounding counties.  Then Chief Smith called and asked me to stop to his house.  When I showed up, there was the car.  Chief Smith and Bob were having fun with Chief Smith’s new car.  Then Cory called.  He was working as an officer in the next county and heard about the car I was trying to stop.  Chief Smith then became mad.  He called the sheriff’s office and told them he was doing pursuit training with me and forgot to notify me.  He told them to cancel the attempt to locate on his car.  He then told me and Bob that we have a no pursuit policy and not to chase after cars.  Finally the last straw with Chief Smith happened.  I was patrolling town when Dave flagged me down.  I pulled over and Dave pulled up next to me.  He stated that his girlfriend was freaking out at the house.  I went over and called Chief Smith, per my orders.  He stated he was on his way over and not to notify dispatch about anything yet.  He said he was ten minutes out.  I went inside and found Angela yelling at Dave and crying.  Dave was yelling back.  I was in the process of splitting the couple up when I observed Angela’s eyes roll back and she fell face first to the floor and started seizing up.  Since I had already worked hospital security and seen seizures, this is exactly what I had seen in the Emergency Room.  I asked Dave how often this happens and he told me lately it’s been happening a lot.  I got down and helped Angela.  Angela got up after a few minutes and I ordered Dave to call 911 next time it happened.  About that time Chief Smith showed up.  I immediately told him what I witnessed and told him I was gonna call for the ambulance.  Chief Smith shouted, “no”.  He told me he would handle it and ordered me to go home.  I did so.  The next day I went to Chief Smith’s house to pick up his squad car for Bob had the one we drove.  Inside I asked Chief Smith if he called EMS for Angela.  Immediately he started yelling at me telling me to forget that anything happened.  He yelled, “You’re not a fucking doctor, you can’t diagnose that she had a fucking seizure!”  Chief Smith stated that if she did have a seizure, it would be a miracle of God for that meth addict to die for she was a waste of oxygen.  I was then told I was done working until I decided to “be a team player” and that Bob was going to get my hours.  I was told that if I didn’t want to follow orders I didn’t have to work anymore.  A few days later I again went back and apologized (again for no reason) for my actions and got my working days back. As a side note two days after this EMS were called to pickup and transport Angela after she had a seizure and was hospitalized for several days.

On the next days off I drove to a friend house, who was an officer in another county, and stayed the night there.  While staying the night, I received a text from Bob, who asked me if the city had to hire someone to replace me.  I sent back a message asking what that meant and immediately received a call from Cory.  He told me that Chief Smith was furious at me and that I was permanently off the schedule unless I went and again apologized (for again no reason) to the chief.  I asked him what I did wrong and he said he had no clue other than the chief was furious at me.  This was the end of the line.  I got the number for the Iowa Ombudsman’s Office and called them.  I had kept 16 pages of notes in a notebook with all these activities and more with dates and times.  I explained everything.  The lady I spoke to told me to quit from that department.  She told me they were doing shady practices and they would look into it, but it was her advice for me to quit.  I took her advice.  My friend and I went back to town and I gathered all my stuff up.  I turned it in to one of the city council members with a resignation letter I typed up quick.  I also had to quickly explain to my parents what happened in a quick 5 minute explanation as to why I was quitting and moving away.  I blocked the phone numbers of Bob and Chief Smith.  Later on that day, I kept getting voicemails from Chief Smith stating it wasn’t too late to come back and apologize and get a few hours of work here and there.  Then more voicemails asking if I really wanted to end my career.  Finally I received the last one stating if I didn’t call him back that there would be nothing I could do to earn my job back and my career would be over.  I never called him back and how have a new phone and number.

I had intentions of working at the department I am at now.  Chief Smith the next day after leaving the voicemails called the city hall where I am living now, and told them I was liar, my integrity was up for question, and that I could not be trusted.  He tried to spread false lies about me but luckily the city I am at now doesn’t put up with shady departments.  They hung up the phone and told him not to call back.  I did however have one court date left at this old department.  I didn’t feel safe being alone with Chief Smith in the courthouse for there wasn't any security, so I decided to have my father attend court with me as a witness.  We met at the courthouse and waited outside the courtroom.  Sure enough Chief Smith showed up.  He looked at me and my father before retreating to another part of the courthouse.  That’s when I was notified that I wasn’t needed because the defendant had plead Guilty of the charges that morning and a trial was no longer needed.  My father and I left without anything but exchanging looks with Chief Smith.    Surprisingly my cousin one day after my resignation, too quit, retiring early after a whole career of being city clerk.  It was odd that he did this one day after I quit working for the city.

The last thing that ever happened with his department was during the city council meeting, where they discussed my immediate resignation form the police department and EMS service, my father stood in front of the city council and confronted Chief Smith for the way I was treated.  I had no idea he was doing this, but they ended the city council sessions, asked the members of the public to leave as well as the news reporter, and conducted a closed session meeting.  There my father laid out the truth to the city council about what was going on with the department.  The city council members argued with my father as Chief Smith accused me of gossiping and spreading lies.  Roger was the only city council member that believed what I was saying and even fought for me amongst the other council members.  He forever has my respect.  He was one that did not participate in the ‘secret meetings’ the other members did with the chief.  Once the council meeting was over, I then set up a time to meet with the mayor and lay down to him myself what was going on.  Once leaving the mayors church, I planned to cut communication from this city and forget I am even from here.  I am ashamed to say that I grew up in a town that doesn’t even fight for its own.",09Jan2019,1

My problem is I don't know what to do with my life. I'm 19 years old, have anxiety for 5 years now and I'm an university student. I have an exam in 2 days when I do the exercises for it, it seems like I know everything, I'm perfect. But when it comes to real exam I just do average. I want to do good and studying hard for it. I have a friend at school. She doesn't even work for exams and doing slightly better than me. It makes me frustrated because I've been working for that exams like one week. People always told me that im a successful girl, you are perfect, you can do everything and my psychiatrist told me that this made me a perfectionist. I was very successful actually. Doing perfect without even trying but after my anxiety popped up I couldn't do anything good like before. I became a average successful, doing everything for just to save the day. But now I feel like shit. Everytime I work harder for my exams or anything I'm doing worse. It's getting worse. I getting treated for my anxiety but i don't even now if it's working. I overcome some of my fears and etc. But I just can't be successful and be sure about myself. Even now trying to share my problems and seek for help it feels like I'm writing stupid things and people throw shit at me.

I haven't been doing good enough in my mocks despite revising, every lesson feels uncomfortable sitting next to a partner, things at home are bad and I can only revise at 1am.

I've spoken to a school counsellor about this stuff, but I'm not sure if I should tell anyone about the real reason for my absences because they'll seem fake or forced.

Yesterday for the first time, i simply told my gf im gonna play some hours with my boys and didnt even ask if its okay or ask for permition. It doest sound like much but i think that´s a major improvemnt that i wasnt afraid she would say no or disagree with it. id force myself to have sex watch things i hate, or going to events that im not interested in. Any input would be apreciated. I just want some advice on how to focus on myself, gain my self respect back, to be independet on my own with out being a leach, and to build up my self confiodence. 

as far as im concerned the longer i stay like this the more she will lose respect for me. i have to be inddependet emoptionally somehow and i have to act quick.

50,"Since I hit puberty I've been having severe lower pelvic pain that impacts my ability to do everyday things at times. I used to miss school because of it, and now as an adult I miss work or live with it. I'm taking birth control which is supposed to help - the first BC helped at first but the help went away with time, and now my new BC doesn't seem to help at all (I'm two months in). An ultrasound turned up nothing, and right now I'm waiting to see a specialist concerning potential endometriosis      
   
I also have a very physical job which leaves me feeling more and more broken all the time. I have chronic on/off pain in my back and wrists, and on top of that a pain in a specific place in my back that feels like a pinch and comes on so suddenly, and is gone just as quickly.   
   
     
I haven't sought out any help for the latter, and for the former I take two different prescription painkillers, one an opioid and one a simple prescription-strength anti-inflammatory. It sucks because a) bad experiences with people with painkillers have left a bad taste in my mouth, and b) my insurance limits me to a 6 pill prescription of the opioid. Right now my approach is basically to wait until the pain is UNBEARABLE and then take meds as a last resort.

I feel like I'm just barely existing. I dread beginning my days. I have this negative thoughts always going through my mind. I feel so tired all the time and I barely take care of myself anymore. Even when I try I will succumb to my old habits. I used to self harm. For whatever reason: family, friends or even relationships. I stopped a year ago.  But thoughts of self harming resurfaced every once in awhile. 

My family...well, my mother passed away when I was very young. My dad got a new girlfriend and she didn't treat that well. My dad neglected me, always choosing his girlfriends and work over his children. My elder sister does not keep in contact with my family anymore. 

I don't know what to do. I want to get better, I want to seek help. I want to tell someone I know but whenever I tell them, they would not take it so seriously. I don't let anyone know how I really feel inside.

I was an average athlete, slightly above average, but lazy student and now as an adult (26 years old) I'm kind of just working a dead-end job and living with my parents. I make music, but have internalized so much that nobody is going to care about it that it took me years to put out and I'm still constantly anxious about it. 

Everything just feels like I'm in a rut all the time. My attitude at home has been low energy since I was a teen, I dread coming into work. I'm anxious about missing any sort of chance I have with music as I get older and I'm constantly worried about money and the fact I'm still living with my parent in my hometown while all my friends get into great relationships, get promoted, get new jobs and move out. While I love them and try and be there for them as much as possible, everything feels like it's kind of moving past me.

55,"I met my boyfriends daughter for the first time yesterday.

I’ve always thought that I’d be strictly childfree my whole life. I’m good with kids, as in they usually love me, but they make me incredibly overwhelmed very quickly.
They also make me very nervous because I have a vomit phobia (emetophobia) and for some reason small humans are a big trigger (More susceptible to bugs?). 

But when I met my boyfriend I fell for him so quickly, and surprisingly was not put off by the fact he has children. I still worried that maybe one day I would realise that it just isn’t something I could cope with.

And although I never ever want children of my own (I hate every aspect of pregnancy and the idea of having a child that I cannot return to its parents also makes me pretty overwhelmed) I haven’t had that ‘I can’t cope’ feeling.

Anyway! I met his four year old daughter for the first time yesterday, and she is the cutest little thing I’ve ever met. My boyfriend took a picture of me when I was doing her hair for her and I can’t stop looking at it it’s just beyond sweet. And seeing my boyfriend with her just filled me with so much happiness. For a while I was super hesitant on meeting his children but when I finally told him I thought I’d be okay meeting his daughter you could just see how happy it made him. 

I just hope that this will all last and I will form a genuine bond with her.

56,"So far 2019 has started off inconsistent. I have myself to blame for that. 

In my whirlwind of self destruction I decided it was a grand idea to cut everyone off. I deleted my Facebook and I’ve stayed off Snapchat and Instagram due to my own paranoia. Let’s be completely honest here, I texted my ex a slew of stuff one night while I was shit face drunk and I am not proud. So now I will hide in shame. Blocked and deleted his number once again. It amazes me how I even remembered his number in the state I was in and let’s not forget to mention it’s been 3 years since we’ve broken up. The fuck is wrong with me, seriously.  

I know I should reach out to the friends that I’ve distanced myself from but I just can’t. So I sit here being butthurt that all my friends are living their lives and I’m here alone venting to strangers because I have no one that I want to burden IRL. I could change that and reach out but I won’t. I used to never be this stubborn when it came to reaching out to my “friends”. 

And distancing made me reflect, no one really misses me. Which means I probably haven’t impacted anyone in a way for them to miss me anyway. Am I that much of a shit person? 

I had to get my birth control shot today and the pregnancy test came back a false positive. Heh, I guess that’s what I get for being impulsive and partaking in risky behavior the last week of December. Got my shot and got retested, and I’m not preggers. Lord knows who the father would be. The anxiety was good for me. I need to STOP. 

Which makes me feel even more bad about myself. Do I not respect myself enough? It’s not like I’m fucking everything in sight, I mean I do have standards but I still could be responsible about it. I’m just so fucking impulsive and I do shit in the moment for that temporary satisfaction which later on leaves me empty. 

Dude I’m trying. I’m staying sober from sex and alcohol. I’m seeing a psychiatrist and therapist. I’m working out and counting my macros. Im drinking water. I’m writing. I’m doing well at work. I take life day by day. I must. If I don’t get better I’ll never be able to hold a relationship. And ya girl is secretly afraid of being alone but I don’t want to settle either. I’ll never settle and maybe that’s the problem. I’m part of my own problem here. It’s so easy to blame things on other factors, but what I do now is essential for my future. I know that, I’ve excelled in my career because of that advice. I just need to implement that in my personal life. I need to find purpose within myself so I don’t self destruct like a bomb and destroy everything in its way. ",09Jan2019,1

I however grew up in a home that did make a big deal out of birthdays. She’s always seemed jealous of this. So for the past three birthdays, I’ve put together a small scavenger hunt in our home to try to add a little excitement to her birthday.  The first year was an amazing surprise that she loved and she’s looked forward to it each year since. I hid her gifts all around our house along with note cards. On each note card was trivia that if she answered correctly by texting the answer to me while I was at work, I would send her an extreme close-up picture of a texture, fabric, or something related to where the gift was hidden. Once she found that gift, the note card with it would repeat the process. And this repeated until she found all the items. The first year she had to answer trivia questions about harry potter to get the clues to the locations. The second year she had to identify what character said a certain quote from any one of the TV shows that we watch together. Last year the notecards had YouTube links which led her to videos of me quoting Marvel cinematic universe characters that she had to identify. This year I’m out of ideas on how to keep it simple for her but also fresh and exciting. I don’t want to keep repeating the same thing every year but I also want to keep the same general concept.

I'll say the wrong thing, someone will be having a bad day and get short with me, whatever. Just little things that happen in any human relationship that most people get over and move on from.

But me? No - that first ""thing"" that happens is the death knell of whatever comfort I had been building up with that person, and being already fairly awkward and introverted, that pretty much ends the relationship right then and there.

Except not always. There's a next stage that can last indefinitely in which every future interaction I have with this person is really strained and uncomfortable. They can tell that I'm not comfortable and that I'm overthinking everything and that I can't get that ONE FUCKING SITUATION that happened 8 months ago out of my head and it just stays there, whipping around my head like a housefly with a constant buzzing I cannot ignore, smacking the sides of my skull every now and then to make *absolutely certain* that I know he's still there.

I was able to manage pretty well for a couple years until I moved in with my boyfriend in December 2017. Everything was going wonderfully, I'd really never been happier, but then as it always does, ""it"" happened. There was a situation that made things awkward and, like clockwork, that little fucking housefly woke up and started buzzing around again. And, other than stopping for a nap every couple weeks, he's been going strong now for over a year.

It's driving me up the fucking wall.

Since New Years, I've been getting my life together more. Working out, learning, meditating, trying harder at my job - the kinda things that have the side effect of building up my confidence. And, incredibly, a couple days ago all of this hard work I'd been doing led to that little housefly falling asleep for a while. Only two days, but he fell asleep all the same. And it was *magical.* I was myself, entirely. Without focusing on and overthinking everything, I was able to make jokes, relax, shoot the shit - just enjoy being with people, *especially* my boyfriend. I felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders, and being able to relax transformed my life... until it stopped.

I suddenly started getting worried. What if that fly wakes up again? What if I go back to how I felt before? And of course, being that this is exactly what the critter feeds off of, his rest was over, and here I am in the same place I have been for the past year, unable to be comfortable in my own home, in my own skin.

I don't know what to do. I'm at a loss and I really feel like I need help. So if anyone's been in this situation before, please tell me what you do to make it better.

Thank you very much for reading.",09Jan2019,1

77,"Yesterday was the 3 year anniversary of my SO's mother passing away. I've never lost a parent. I came close by losing my grandpa in October, but I can't even imagine ever losing my mom. My SO really struggles with this because I can tell he had undying love and appreciation for her. We've only been together going on two years, so I never met her.   


I looked around our house in the morning and realized it was a disaster. If he's anything like me, a messy/cluttered house just adds to my anxiety and sadness on a bad day. I have an hour lunch break and I high-tailed it home to clean - EVERYTHING. I did three loads of dishes, put our laundry away, cleaned up the random christmas stuff from our living room, picked up the dog's toys that were littered all over the house, cleaned off our kitchen table and counters and made our bed. He gets home before I do, so I wanted him to walk into a warm and welcoming home.   


I ran to the grocery store after work to pick up a few things to cook for dinner. When I got home he was like, ""Girlfriend - it's so clean! Thank you, today is hard... it's the annivesary."" I hugged him, told him I knew and to relax.. that I had dinner under control.  


I spent the next hour prepping the perfect meal - his mom's meatloaf. He'd talked about it numerous times while we were together. But never got around to making it. He didn't have the recipe, so I texted his sister for it, even though she blocked me on facebook and probably hates my guts. She helped me out and I got to work. After everything was ready, I called my SO into the kitchen. He saw the meatloaf on the counter and was excited. He loves meatloaf, but he had no idea it was his mom's meatloaf. He cut into it and took a small piece off and started bringing it to his mouth while asking me what recipe I found online. I just stood in the doorway looking at him, a smile on my face as he took the bite. You could see it in his eyes instantly. He closed them, and a smile crept across his face too. ""Nevermind,"" he said. ""I know exactly where you got it."" He hugged me so tight, I think I felt him cry a little, and I knew everything I did was perfect.   


It felt so good to bust my ass to give him a clean home, make an uncomfortable situation for myself by reaching out to his sister.. just for him to feel a little less alone on this hellish day.

78,"We had to put our dog down last week. I had her for 11 years and met my husband about 9 years ago, so he knew her for a long time too. 

I’m heartbroken over losing her, but being without a dog this week has shown me how much I really miss having a dog around. My husband went over to a friends house the other night and our kids were asleep and I was just on edge the whole time. Having a dog around makes me feel more secure. I’m also not sleeping well without her in the bed.  

My husband is a much more emotional person than I am and he says he wants to wait at least a year before getting another dog. He always (good naturedly) teases me for my “heart of stone” and I’m wary of telling him that I’m ready to start looking after a week. I’m not looking to replace our old dog, and I’m gutted that she’s gone, but I also just miss having a dog around.  I kind of “jokingly but if you go with it I’m not joking” told him I looked at PetFinder yesterday and he just shook his head.",09Jan2019,1

80,"My (29/F) fiance (34/M) and I are in an LDR. We haven't ever spent much time together irl but I absolutely know this is the man I want to be with. It may sound cliche but he is unlike any man I have ever dated. He is kind and considerate to a fault. 

Anyway I was diagnosed bipolar 2 years ago and am on meds. After an entire year of being well adjusted, I had a depressive episode a week ago. Once it set in, I pretty much lost all sense of reason, snapped at my fiance of all people and just yelled via text. I refused to answer his calls. And I was mean. So mean. The sweetheart didn't deserve it one bit. 

I told him to ""fucking grow up and leave me alone"".
Stop being clingy. 
Find some hobbies/friends. 

And it's fucking funny because at the end of the day I was the insecure, sad loser. 

My fiance, bless his heart, just told me to take my time. I planned an appointment with my therapist, stayed at a mental health facility for 3 days and returned home on Monday since the wedding is on Sunday (13th of Jan). 

I feel better now and knowing my fiance must be distraught, I called him up and let him know that I loved him and that I was sorry. He was very polite and I mean very polite. Like he was hurt and didn't want to let me. He refused to acknowledge how bitchy I was. 


I don't know what the point of this is. I just wanted to get it out. I read a lot of tragic stories on reddit from the SOs of bipolar individuals and I just don't want to put him through that. I'm torn between what's right and the pressure to go through with the wedding that everyone expects. I feel so guilty. 

My love, I'm so very sorry. ",09Jan2019,1
