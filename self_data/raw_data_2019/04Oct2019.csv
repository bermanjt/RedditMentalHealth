0,"I thought I was good at calculus until I started calc 3 in college and did a group quiz with other folks. I saw how they easily comprehended some questions while I still didn’t get it and it honestly made me embarrassed because I felt useless. I didn’t really offer much insight other than the fact that I would still be working on a problem while they compared/explained answers. But as insignificant as this situation may seem, i guess this moment for me highlighted our instinctive response as humans to compare ourselves to others. I realized that I placed this expectation to always be good in math because I was good at it in high school and that because my peers were good at it, I had to be just as good to prove myself. And I guess this can also imply that I always saw effort/trying hard as an indicator of low ability. But to anyone feeling like this in any setting, I just want you to know that it’s okay to struggle! Definitely easier said than done, but after much reflection, we can only go up from here if we put our minds to it! Struggling only shows that it clicks easier for some more than others, but at the end of the day, you learn much more from struggle/failure than you do from quick success! 

Ps sorry for this weird post. Just had to get it off my chest 😅",04Oct2019,2
1,"I don’t know what I should do because I feel like doing something big but all the friends I used to have were from High School and they just stopped talking to me and inviting me to things. I feel like a loser because I used to always party with my friends it’s like I don’t exist to them anymore. And since I’ve gone almost a year without hanging out with friends, I’ve become socially awkward and it’s hard for me to make friends now. I posted this on a different sub but it got removed.",04Oct2019,2
2,"Alt account beacause I still have a shred of dignity.

So there I was, 15 years old and home alone. My parents left me a pizza to eat when I got hungry. I'm playing a game and lose track of time. Turns out to be around midnight when I realize I never cooked the pizza, and I'm starving. So I get the pizza, put it on the counter and get an idea.

So you know in pornos, the pizza delivery guy sticks his dick in the pizza box? Me, being a comedic genius, along with being really tired, thinks its a great idea to cut a hole in the side of the box, stick my dick in it, and pretend I'm in a porno. Haha, story over right? I wish.

My stupid self decides that it's the funniest thing ever, and I need to share it. So I pull out my phone and video me opening the pizza box, with those haunting words burned into my mind. ""Hey ma'am, your pizz- Whoah how'd that get there?"" My dogs are staring at me making this shitty video, with my dick on the kitchen counter, and even they are ashamed.

So of course, I send the video to my closest friends, and they weren't laughing with me, they were laughing at me. They sent it to their friends, and they sent it to their friends, and so on and so forth till when I'm at school the next day, all I hear is, ""hey you want a big meaty sausage pizza?"" And thus my freshman year of high school was ruined.

TLDR: Stuck my dick in a pizza box, sent the video to everyone, now I'm known as the sausage pizza delivery guy.",04Oct2019,17
3,"I'm 34, and I feel like I've never had a job that really holds my attention.  
I used to work in animation.  I've been trying to switch to programming, and getting a lot of real basic office contract work while trying to get that underway.

Almost every job I've had, I feel pretty well focused and engaged for a month or so, and then I sort of tune out, and it's a constant struggle to make myself focus.

And I never really had this problem in school.  *Part* of it, I think, is the weird way school is gamified.  You have all these regular tasks with ""right answers"" to discover.  And you've got regular schedules and a person whose job it is to guide you through the process.

But school also has variety and a strong sense of community.  Students often feel all in it together in a way that co-workers don't (and I suppose pay and company performance factor into that).  And you're always going around between a wide variety of different subjects, doing different kinds of projects.  Building software in one class, writing papers in another, doing paintings for another.

I feel frustrated by the jobs that seem to exist out there.  I want to imagine that there's something that has the sense of variety and direction to hold my interest.",04Oct2019,6
5,"This came to mind when I felt the slightest bit of an autumn breeze in the air the other day. I shut my eyes, and I felt it stir up something inside of me. I couldn't put my finger on what it was until I remembered the day, two years ago, when I was seventeen. It was the day I finally told my abuser, my best friend's father, that I was done with him. I remember how I sent the message on the iPod touch I had smuggled into my backpack because my mother no longer trusted me with a phone anymore. All because I insisted on defending him when she found out. 

He made me so happy at first. He made me feel like nothing could hurt me again. It was what Shakespeare described as ""these violent delights have violent ends."" The more I began to depend on him emotionally, the more he made me give to him in return. Sometimes it was in the back seat of his car. Once it was in my friend's room while his daughter, who was seven at the time, was trying to come in because she wanted to spend time with her father. He yelled at her and told her he was going to beat her ass if she didn't stop. 

It was hard to feel like a victim because I could have stopped him. But then I remembered, I tried. There were times I said ""I'm not sure if I want to"" and ""not right now, I don't feel ready."" There was one time I even asked him to stop, but he wouldn't, and I didn't question it.

I didn't question a lot of things. Like when he told me he was visiting a friend who was a woman to ""take pictures for his new album."" I told him I didn't know he made one. He said he hadn't started. I didn't question when he said he wasn't still married to his wife and I found out he was. Twice, I let him convince me that I was the one being toxic when I confronted him on this. Finally, I didn't question when I asked him why he felt like he had to lie to me so much and he said ""because I thought you were already broken and could take it."" 

I felt broken. It was his half hearted ""I love you""s that made me feel whole... but I was very much whole. But the way he made mean comments about my body, the way he ignored me, and the way he manipulated me broke me down until I couldn't take it any more. The way he said ""well, we had fun didn't we?"" when my mother separated us. No final ""I love you"" when he thought he wouldn't hear from me again. Time separated from him made me realize that he was breaking me. 

So even though he tried to find me again at least twice since then, I never returned to him. I thought about this, as I was walking to my car from work when I felt that autumn breeze. I thought about who I was then. I felt like nothing. I had nothing. And then I looked down at my perfectly manicured hands and my favorite skirt. I earned that. 

I have a fulfilling job. It helps me buy nice clothes that make me happy, but it also helps me with my car insurance, so I can convince my mom I'm responsible. My boss is one of my best friends. He teaches me about how men should really treat me. Not to mention the other men in the office who have taken to doing the same thing without any hidden intentions. I have friends who love me and always listen when I need them.  My therapist is very kind, and he genuinely cares and helps me when I struggle. I have cats that run to come greet me every day and birds that appreciate berry salads I make them. I'm over halfway done with my bachelor's degree, and my GPA is a 3.8. 

I always remember: that was the one time I really thought my life was over. And it wasn't. It had just started.",04Oct2019,56

8,"That's a large contributing reason I'm incompetent at everything, really.

I'm barely a person, really, because people exist in the world and are effective somehow. I'm too scared to show up to anything, anything even slightly out of line I chicken out of. I don't show up to my job(s) often because I imagine situations I don't know how to easily handle, but obviously not showing up to your responsibilities makes things worse and more difficult. I'm not the kind of person meant to take anything from the world. It wouldn't be quite so sad and pathetic if I didn't seem like the opposite sort of person. Plenty of people can have a great passive life and also have nothing more wanted from them, but I'm not lucky enough to be that type of person. I was born the sort of person that needs to be a moving concrete roadblock, but I'm not even a speedbump. 

I can tell myself I'll be that roadblock, but it doesn't make it true or make me any less terrified of life. 

I'm also chronically lazy, and apathetic toward everything, nothing seems worth doing, ever, so I don't, and my subpar life is my own fault. Life for me is just barely pretending on the surface level that I can do anything productive or originally useful of my own accord. I'm the type of person who struggles to keep up in the most mild or entry level environments, so that's the perpetual struggle my life will be caught up in. And it's only getting worse, for me personally and for the world around me. 

No idea how I'll show up at work tomorrow. It's an easy job. I've been sick and away from it. Settling back in is questionable, speedbumps on an easy road I still cower behind, let alone trip over. Need to be a roadblock, at least I'm dense enough.",04Oct2019,3

13,"i'm 20. i'm at university right now for international law. i enjoy it, but i kept having this nagging feeling that it's just *the most tolerable thing,* not my passion, not what i really want to do. 

i went to career services earlier this week and i told her my major/minor/certificate plan, all that. she basically goes, ""that all sounds great, so what's the problem?"". i explain to her that it just doesn't feel *right.* i enjoy it, most of the time, and i can make myself feel passionate about just about anything if i approach it the right way, but like i said: *most tolerable option*. 

honestly think what i needed was to basically make someone coax the truth out of me that i've always known. she asked me what i enjoyed before going to university, what kind of extracurriculars i did, and i couldn't think of anything else -- because i didn't *do* anything else -- besides the fact that i did acting camps and lessons from the ages basically 6-16. i used to put on little shows for my family every night when i was young, and my mother used to say: ""if you don't become an actress, i don't know what we're gonna do with you.""

i haven't been able to focus on schoolwork since that meeting with career services. i still do my school work, but i have to trick myself harder than ever before into actually enjoying it enough to take the time to understand it and do it *well*. i've felt more secure, happier, and the most *me* i've felt since graduating high school since realising what i really wanna do with my life, or at least what i truly enjoy. my dad commented on that before i even told him what i realised. i wanna tell good, important stories, and be a part of them. 

but damn that job insecurity and the fact that it seems like the only way to really make a living out of it is to well...""make it"". that does scare me, ngl. but the joy and exhilaration i get out of the performance and process...i don't know, it's been a while, but there's absolutely nothing like it. 

but i told my dad this the other night: the reason i know i gotta do it is because i'm *terrified.* i'm terrified because it's like when you're at the top of a rollercoaster and there's literally nowhere else to go but down and on and around the ride. i don't have a choice. i have to do it. anything that is inevitable is kinda scary, no matter what it is. and this is no different.",04Oct2019,3

The example that comes to mind is Endgame, when they had all the women come together for 20 seconds to fight together. I wouldn't mind it at all if it weren't such obvious pandering. I didn't walk into that movie to cheer for a big social cause, I walked in to be entertained. Similarly I don't watch a football game with the intent of rallying behind the issue of whatever, I watch it to be entertained and watch football.

I just wish I could be entertained again without at the same time having to have social issues thrown at my face.

23,"Fun/interesting story that I felt like sharing. My friend went to a private high school in SF and last year one of her friends (who ran the School newspaper) wanted to publish an article, interviewing Rachel Dolezal. The article was to be objectively written, bringing up topics like race, identity, and other important issues like such. After her friend interviewed Rachel Dolezal, he wrote the article and was ready to publish it... that is, until the school told him that he was not allowed to. When the school heard about the article, the administration and some of the staff went haywire. The heads of each branch of the School (there are many of these schools) were involved; there were meeting almost everyday after school talking about the article, etc. They thought that by just having an article with the name ""Rachel Dolezal"" in it, it would drive people to tears, make people want to kill themselves, or bring up issues that are too dangerous to be discussed. One teacher even compared publishing an article interviewing Rachel Dolezal, to interviewing a neo-nazi. Please note, the article was going to discuss Rachel in an objective way, not supporting or condoning her, just laying out facts for the reader to form their own questions, thoughts, and opinions. The school told the guy that he shouldn't publish the article, or talk about it as it would offend people, and hurt other students to the core. They ended up banning him from publishing and talking about the article, and told him that it's not ""freedom of speech"" when it comes down to hurting others (and believe it or not, they were most worried about hurting transgender people, since Rachel identifies as ""transracial"", and that is harmful to the trans community). But how can an objective article talking about a fascinating person and important topic be so harmful? I just thought that this whole situation was messed up, especially from a school who has ""freedom of speech, thought, and expression"" written all over it.

Anyway... what are your guys's thoughts? When should you cut off freedom of speech? Is the school in the right, or in the wrong? Let me know.",04Oct2019,3
24,"I'm not the smartest person ever, however I didn't do bad in school and I am capable of doing most things. I got decent grades, I answer stuff in class ect. Growing up I do have mental disorders but they don't stop me from doing stuff, ect anxiety did not stop me from being able to know how to mop the floors.

Even when I left school it still happened. My mother (I am about to move out) constantly explains stuff to me that I've done a million times before, for example how to unpack the dishwasher, which I know how to do. People like to baby me and I have no idea why. I do not act like a baby, I don't ask people to do stuff for me. I've had people ""remind"" me that I am allowed to go to the bathroom at the airport, no idea why as I did not need to go and as an adult I can tell when I need to go. 

When I was at TAFE  I remember I paired up with a girl for an assessment. She started explaining what the teacher had said. I thought she was just going over it so she could see what she didn't understand. But then she looks at me and says ""you know, this would be a lot faster if I didn't have to explain this to you"" I never asked for her to explain it and had no idea why she felt the need to.

Another time the teacher asked me after one of our classes if I understood everything, I said ""yes, did I do a bad job on the last assessment?"" To which she told me no and that it was good. I know for a fact that I was the only person in the class that she singled out for that.

Now, I know some people are going to say ""it's just people caring for you"" however I see a difference between caring and people acting like you aren't capable of doing basic things. It's not just ""hey it's a bit cold outside maybe bring a jumper"" it's every single day where multiple people around you treat you as a kid who is still exploring and learning the world. It's gotten to a point where I hate asking for help, I hate accepting help or advice because I'm so used to the constant dumbing down. Imagine if every single time you did the laundry someone came and explained how to do it. That's what it's like.

26,"So I’m a college freshman. It had been about 4 weeks since college started and i still didn’t have a single friend. I felt lonely and isolated at a university of 40,000 students. My housing was an apartment due to a housing issue with the university. I had huge amounts of financial aid. I found a person who seemed liek they wanted to be my friend and the offered for me to come hang with his friend group that night. One thing led to another and we drunkenly break into a construction site. I’m not comfortable with this. I didn’t even drink I’m highschool but I was so desperate for friends that I was just trying to fit in. They break a door down and walk into these tunnels the university uses to transport power across campus. We go in and end the night coming out about a half mile away. This happens two more times over the next two weeks, but then an article is published about the investigation. I have never felt so stressed in my life. The charges were potentially felonylevel. I have never even gotten a ticket. I was bullied in highschool for being the nerdy kid who liked tech. The police question one of the members of the group and he identifies a few of us but not me.  I go in the next morning and turn myself in anyway because I couldn’t handle the guilt and it was only a matter of time. Now I’m more stressed than I have ever been in my life. I’m full of regret. I hate myself. My parents don’t know and if they did I can’t imagine the result. I will loose all my financial aid (pays for 75% of my education), I am waiting to see if the charges will be pursued by the prosecutor and what those charges are (likely burglary, theft, and trespassing), I am also waiting to see what the campus does for it’s side of the punishment. I could easily be permanently expelled. I was on track to go to college for 5 years and graduate with a bachelors in BIM, Masters in CGT “, and minor in global tech. I would have been taken by an international company. None of this will likely happen now. I could also gain a criminal record with jail time. This kills any chance to apply to other universities or get a half decent job. I’m a good kid. I got involved with the wrong crowd of kids Because I thought they wanted to be my friends. I was wrong. I have never felt so stressed, angry, shameful, and depressed in my life. Multiple times suicide has crossed my mind as a likely result if it goes as bad as it could. I have nearly been able to sleep and eat for the past two weeks. I eat two meals a day on a good day and normally just one. I sleep about 4-5 hrs. I feel like shit and I am having a hard time living with myself. I can’t tell anyone that i trust Because is not have anyone like that. I have distanced myself from these individuals and I now have a friend group but it’s too late anyway. I live in fear and regret. The consequences of my decisions haunt me day and night. The fear of the unknown and what’s to come make it that much worse. I have an appointment in a few days with a campus counselor but I just don’t know how to go on. If you have any advice it would be much appreciated. Thank you.",04Oct2019,2

31,"I made a post on Facebook a very long time ago about not knowing how to let things go and move on. I explained how frustrating it is to hear “just let it go” without any explanation as to how, simply because what came natural to others was a complicated fucking equation to me. So I want to explain how to do that, from someone who had to learn.

Firstly, if you don’t know how, you’ve likely developed some habits. You’ll spend nights awake, thinking about things you’ve done, or how things could have gone differently. You’ll dig through boxes of old movie tickets and letters from people that were no longer in your life, yearning for the good times, because; “they were so much simpler.” You probably don’t delete text messages— instead, whenever things get bad, you’ll scroll for hours through conversations that happened years ago.

These habits only hurt you. The first step to letting go is very deliberate— you force yourself to stop doing these things. Delete the text messages, or archive them. Each time you want to look at them but know they’ll only upset you, text a friend you have now. Pet your cat. Hug your parents, or sibling, or significant other. Do something in the present that you’re grateful for. Instead of going through old letters, write new ones. Again, focus on the present. Interrupting these habits is a physical way of interrupting your thoughts. Also, interrupt your thoughts. Redirect the subject to something else each time you feel that urge of nostalgia and longing. Very Pavlovian, very simple, easier said than done. But it makes a difference.

Another key one is, “things weren’t simpler.” Yeah, in comparison to now, sure they are. Looking back on it, of course you’d rather be in a group project than work a twelve hour shift. But that’s only because you have context. Back then, things never felt simple. And if you went back, they still wouldn’t. Your crush rejecting you would still feel like a massive L, your parents fighting would still feel like a collapsing foundation, and you getting an F on a test you studied for would still make you cry. Things are only as simple now as they’ve ever been. Pain, like all other emotions, is subjective based on our experiences.

Finally, and I know I said this already— be grateful for your present. You long for the past and you can’t let go because you feel that hole deep inside of you; the aching abyss that someone or something left behind. And honestly? I can guarantee that what you think will fill it, won’t. Your parent coming back won’t fill the abyss that was left by them never being there in the first place. Your crush changing their mind will never dissipate that lingering doubt, or be a suitable replacement for self love. Chances are, you’re craving something that only you yourself can provide. 

Most importantly, and a TLDR; closure cannot be granted by someone. It’s you, forgiving yourself, forgiving others, and closing the book to start a new one. It’s okay to look back and reflect.

33,"I'm using a 2nd account for this because it'a stupid.

I've had only one boyfriend in my life and he was a year younger than me. That was when I was 19. Before that I had few guys asking me out, but it was 90% younger guys than me. 

It never necessarily bothered me (I'm talkin 1 or 2 years younger, not *illegal* younger). I often liked them, but usually our personalities just didn't match. Even now, years later, the only dating I've done is with younger guys. The oldest one was still a few months younger than me. 

Personally I've never been told I look younger (more often that I look older).

Could there be something behind that or is it just pure coincidence?",04Oct2019,1

I’ve been busting my butt for a couple of dreams for my future for about a year, but today it just feels further away than it did a month ago. I feel useless, incapable, and not intelligent.

35,"I've been doing a lot of self reflection, and I've realized that I'm not mentally healthy. I have very low self esteem, feel that I need attention as validation, and I compulsively lie to get it. Almost everything I do and everything I say isn't what I really feel or want to do, but is a result of what I think will get me the most attention. I feel a lot of shame about who I am, and a lot of guilt about who I hurt in the past. I fear failure, and that life and everyone in it will leave me behind.

Now that I've realized these things, I'm even more scared about what to do next, and if I can really change who I am. It's never worked in the past.

Ended that 3 year long friendship

38,"*Hey*, 

Although I do have friends and family to talk to, I really want someone else to hear my thoughts, I guess.  

I kind of had a realization tonight that I am really making it... I'm actually succeeding. From 5th grade to 10th grade I had rough social anxiety/depression and yeahhh that whole thing. I weighed 258lbs (38% bodyfat) and really hated who I was for a long time inside and out. I guess I never thought I would make it to the point I'm at today. 

In the last 2 years thanks largely to reddit, I have lost more than 55lbs and have gained upwards of 15lbs lean mass. I am sitting at 208lbs and roughly 16.5%BF. I really like the way I look (although I will likely be eternally striving for better) and feel so at peace in my own skin. I never knew feeling uncomfortable being yourself was not typical beforehand. 

I am a freshman in college and do my own laundry, shop for and cook all my own food (healthy eating), wake myself up, go to my own classes, manage my day entirely, etc. Although we are probably not even halfway through the semester, I am sitting at a 3.9ish GPA, and am really proud of how my studying is coming along. I am putting in the time and energy to properly understand the work, and not cheat my way through like I would have in high school. 

I have never had a girlfriend/kiss/etc. in my life and I asked someone out tonight and although she politely said no, I feel so much better than I did before. I nearly asked her out 3 months ago and didn't have the balls to ask. I talked myself out of it, and this time I powered through and just asked. I have been so close to asking different people on many separate occasions, but always managed to not... I really am proud of myself for working up the confidence to just ask. I actually broke the trend of chickening out... don't think that's set in yet. 

I really had no passions prior to these last few years, and now I have far too many interests for my time or money. Starting with fitness and branching out as confidence and happiness rose, in the last 2 years the following became passions of mine: coffee, vinyl, fashion, journaling, skating, weightlifting, travel, video games, golf, and so much more. 

Fashion has perhaps been the biggest passion of mine besides fitness. Since my body is of relatively normal size now, I fit into clothes as the brand intended. It has opened an entire world of possibilities that I absolutely love exploring. My closet is built up enough that I always feel comfy, stylish, and confident in my clothes. 

I think this is kind of it, thanks for reading :)",04Oct2019,1
39,"This literally just happened and I don't have anyone to vent to or tell so I guess this is the perfect place to let it out. 

I pulled an all nighter last night trying to get my project in a direction I was satisfied with. Literally sat at my computer from 10pm to 5am just working on this shit (poster design). I've been slacking a lot but I've recently been commiting and trying to do my work. 

I was tired as fuck and very light headed by the morning and so I took a break cuz I had made something I was satisfied with. While I was scrolling on my phone I fell asleep and I woke up at 8:30am. I still had to finish a small booklet, this would've taken around an hour. So I was doing this and the motherflipping power went out of the whole apartment. I had to wait a half hour for this shit to come back. Then I got to it and finished it but it was already 11:00. I have to get there by 11:30. I knew I was already late so I messaged the class group that I'd be late. 

I still had to go get the shit I did printed out cuz I don't have laptop to show it on like everybody else. I went to the place I usually go to and I shit you not, the guy takes a full hour to print a couple a4 sheets, which, mind you, is not cheap at all here. I waited impatiently almost ready to blow a fuse cuz it took so much time. Today was also Friday and I had to go to the mosque at 12:45 but I skipped it for this class. It was now almost 1:00 cuz it takes a while to get there. 

I got there and I was happy I finally got there. I eagerly went up to the classroom ready to tell everyone that I'm sorry I'm late and that everything that could've gone wrong has gone wrong. But instead my teacher just stopped me at the door and told me to leave. She gave me a big lecture about how I can't just waltz into her class at anytime I want. She even lectured me about missing the morning class (which is run by this guy who I accidentally disrespected by wearing glasses with colored lenses and she blew a fuse about that and lectured me that day). 

Anyway, I had to stand there and take this hairdryer while all my freshly printed stuff was in my hands, ready to show her. I just remembered thinking why the fuck did I do all this shit just so I'll get sent home with nothing and also miss my prayers. I felt so jaded. This was shit. I said nothing in response and only spoke agree to leave. There would've been even more shit had I said something. I just can't believe that she was so stubborn. I don't think she got my message that I was going to be late or something. Aren't teachers suppose to be open to students who show up and want to get their work reviewed and stuff.

I just wish there was a fine or something instead of getting kicked out for being late. This was so futile. Stuff like this is what makes me not wanna go to college and just laze at home. I worked so hard and got shit. I know stuff like this happens to a lot of people but its just so demoralizing. Ugh. In all fairness I am notorious throughout the department for being a late comer but I've never been denied review or discussions. This was such a waste of time and especially money, which is so tight now. This whole year, in terms of college has been shit. I'm so fed up of shit like this. 

Well that's it. Thanks kind stranger, for listening to this rant.",04Oct2019,1
40,"So..for sex I came to the conclusion I am a more dom leaning switch type deal. Not that I'm super into BDSM its just kinda how to best describe my role to you. I'm afraid to explore that more soft side of me though. I've looked deep on why that is and the conclusion I've come to...

Is because in life I'm honestly very easygoing and typically...quiet for lack of a better word. In my family I'm surrounded by very..overpowering personalities. I don't like to fight so I tend to be more easygoing. Even when they do a lot of stuff  
I hate I bite my lip and tolerate it. When I stand up for myself I get a lot of push back and basically get pushed into silence again. My family is honestly very toxic and have actually even lately taken to bullying me. In friendships I also tend to get bullied and pushed around or be around people that never have time for me. Sadly its something I seem to attract more then I would like.

Now I'm trying to do better. I seem to be attracting better friends? At least I hope so. I'm tired of it. I tend to loose a lot when it comes to things I want and when I do finally get it? It's almost an all out street fight. In part though it's my fault. I did that because I was intimidated by my parents or the people around me and was scared to be myself (Which is a lot more of a spitfire then you;d expect from my posts)

I had one sex experience? It was a similar pattern. I let myself be really vulnerable and then got very very screwed over and abused around. Actually yelled at on a few occasions. The only reason I had a sexual experience with her tbh? Was because she kept openly teasing me in front of like 4 other people about being ""The innocent one"" and giggling that I didn't know a lot so when it was offered I was just ""Fine fuck it"" and I didn't know it would be hardcore BDSM and it was horrible I walked away feeling violated even though it was long distance and I wasn't touched and was just made to witness something she was doing to another person....whiiich I wasnt ready for cause I wasnt warned it would be hardcore BDSM for 2 hours. Then my friends said I was overreacting and I just kinda accepted it because...guess I was...? I don't know.

Just..every time I try to trust and be open and let myself be more sensitive I get hurt. I don't get taken seriously as a person anymore. It doesn't help that I don't know what a healthy dynamic looks like. I've never had it. Or even seen it which I mentioned before. All of them are ""one person is kinda controlling and is always dominating the other""

So I guess when I hear ""submissive"" in sex. My brain goes ""Oh great. More of this."" People tell me the right guy won't force me into shit and will let me be all sides of myself and accept all of me. But I have so much trouble believing that because...no one ever has. They just want my more quiet easygoing side. No matter who it is and so I'm terrified thats gonna happen all over again when I let myself be more submissive when the mood strikes with a guy...and I'm tired of being seen as this weak little fragile thing that can just be trampled all the time. Everyone interprets my occasional softness as ""Oh! That means I can get whatever I want out of you all the time!"" so I'm terrified it'll happen in sex as well.

So that's it. It's probably a dumb fear anyway but if you have something to combat it? I will take it I guess.",04Oct2019,2

My only joy is him, just him after 4 years dating.

A couple days ago my manager who I am really close with surprised my and said they are resigning.  Obviously on a personal level this is depressing news so I was really anxious and I’m not looking forward to the departure.  

But what makes it worse is we are literally a two person department.  I’m terrified of picking up all the slack once they leave.  I don’t believe I can do it and I can’t stop stressing over it.  I’m waking up sweating.  Now I have people telling me to go for the position and I am terrified.  I don’t think I’m prepared for that quite honestly and I know how much weekend time and after hours is put in and that’s not what I want for my life.  The only thing that sounds nice is the money, aside from that not interested.  

I’m also concerned that by not showing interest in it that colleagues will think less of me.  They think I can do it but I know myself.  I don’t handle more than one source of stress at the same time well and I don’t think I should do it for my sake.

Every love story has an nice beginning and mostly ends are weird,annoying,stupid, sad, some has nice endings but my relationship if I can call it like this had an bad ending, all I wanted wasn't to taste an dick and see how it feels or get an dick for first time, I wanted to have an relationship with a man, when he asked me to ask that guyto send me his dick I refused and I pasted my love'' prickness in my mind I was smth like, np I'll make him forget about other mans and all he'll need will be me and I could make it don't doubt, my strategyes and incredible and like magic, well, this is my first love/ half love story, I mean half love because seems only I loved he just liked me for the way I look, for my big dick, nothing more, he liked me and told me a lot of times how beautiful I am and gorgeous and love me during sex and after,things I saw on phone he didn't told to other mans, that maked me feel special, if I were wanted I could make he mine, after I decided I want him I uninstalled grindr and keep talking with him over sms, in fact everything could go as I want but itb wasn't meant to be, I deserve someone who respects me more and I will get one day a man as I desire, hope you liked my story, it happened now a month ago.",04Oct2019,1

I feel terrible! How am I going to stop myself from ruining this guy's day forever with these bad puns! I suck! I already have a hoodie joke, and a Me. Rogers joke in the bag! I can't be stopped and I feel terrible about it. That's all.",04Oct2019,0

69,"My uncle, one of my greatest heroes, I recently found out, is about exactly the person I always figured he was. 

The man is not actually my uncle. He is my grandfather's cousin. We just all call him Uncle _____."" 

He never wanted any recognition. In fact, quite the opposite. I would say he vehemently opposed recognition for decades, even. He was a Vietnam veteran. He was a Marine. From what I heard growing up, damn near first boots on the ground. He was a drill instructor for marines, after a while.

I remember he said that someone recommended he reconsider training Marines (this is just a story I heard, so take it with a grain of salt). He asked why. They said,""You remember your drill instructor running circles around you and shaping up everyone?"" He said yes. ""You remember how his uniform looked?"" He said yes. ""Did you ever see him sweat?""

For twenty years after Vietnam, other than family, no one really even knew he was a Vietnam veteran (this was before I was born, so I don't actually know). He did not bother talking about it. Not because he was ashamed/hurt/whatever, but because he simply considered that chapter of his life to be closed.

I knew him in my early twenties. That is where I come in. I was his grocery boy, during a time I had very little going on in my life. My grandpa would drag me to walmart, and we would buy groceries for him, and bring them back to his place, chat for as long as the conversation lasted, and leave. We would load his garbage bags into the truck, take it to the dump, and go home. That was when I would spend time looking at books or historical relics at his house, and listen to stories. He even showed me a revolver, that, while he has no proof, he believes to have been John Wesley Hardin's. Honestly, after seeing it for myself, I believe it, too.

The man, who is a marine until the day he dies, became a history teacher. Left the marines, left Vietnam, and became a career history teacher. He taught since probably the late 70s or early 80s, though I never heard a date. He did it until he couldn't any longer, a couple years ago according to his university, then kept doing it as a podcast. I won't say what podcast, because I doubt he would want that, and I don't want to seem like I am promoting something.

I post this because I just listened to his Memorial Day podcast literally three times in a row. It is one of the most moving, heartbreaking, accurate recordings of a person that was physically there, that I have ever heard. And there are almost no details. It just is. He was there. 

 I have never cried from hearing a person tell me a story. In person, anyway. I have never cried at a movie, song, speech, whatever. Today, I can't really say that about a podcast. He was there. I have heard him say ""how do we know such and such about history? We don't, but we know what someone said, because they were there.""

He was there.",04Oct2019,1

I restarted the computer over and over again but they all kept spreading like a disease.

82,"That is what I am. I feel like this is a place I should talk about when I find something positive but I have nothing. Having no friends outside of my family is the pits. I've been told I'm selfish and passive aggressive and for once in my life I am ready to embrace it. I never thought I was those things. Kind of thought I was caring, honest, thoughtful.  Those things in me died a while back. Back in a time when I thought I mattered. I was playing cruel tricks on myself. 

I've made some mistakes that I can not correct. I hate going to work. Got tangled up with gossip and now I'm the one paying for it. I was never the first one to speak of something but was the one to get thrown under the bus. I learned my lesson to keep my mouth shut. It won't change how they see me but at least I'll know I'm changing my ways. I wasn't even part of the gossip for that long! But apparently, they liked the cunt who they talked about more than me and when confronted....so childish. I feel childish. Lol. I just hate coming to work knowing I'm trying to do good while having eyes sear into the back of my head.

It's not only work. I can't keep a friend for shit. I start off strong but somewhere along the line I fall off. Do they lose interest and I sense that or do I think they are losing interest and shut them out. Begin to act weird so they go away on my terms. I'm not good at conversations and a lot of the time I don't have the energy to keep up. I just want it to be quiet. I don't blame others for not wanting to be around of they can pick up on it. 

This hopeless feeling sucks. I've tried therapy but got kicked out because I wouldn't show up for appointments. Thought to myself that I am taking away from other people who need more help than me. At the same time I really was taking from them because I wasn't canceling my appointments so others could book. Either way, I don't think whatever is said to me is sincere. It is all lies. Things are only said to be polite, diplomatic, it's their job. 
Wish my husband would just let me go. I feel bad for him. But he won't. I can't help but think that he hates that he loves me.

84,"quiet as a cloud, Always. 

He would walk right past you, and i am sure no one would notice. Just another kid with a heavy head, racing thoughts, partially in love with occasional emptiness. he would loathe people. Attention, to be precise. but mostly just the human convention of socialising. 

the idea of 'fitting in' would make him anxious. One of those lonely souls who would disappear in a crowd because he is afraid the crowd would disappear on him if he stays too long. I was eager to listen-
to all those strings he would pull inside his mind when he walked through corridors. 

I liked how he was quick and witty at making small talks over text, but now i could feel him thinking hard before speaking to me. It might have been his social awkwardness. i needed him to think less and allow his mind to wander free. I could tell that he liked my company. I liked him too, but i think it was out of curiosity because i couldn't figure him out. Somehow, Something changed. i think it was a moment under the night sky, but i am sure that is all it took.
 
His eyes wrinkled when he smiled, and i could almost see joy dripping down those dimples as the moonlight bounced off his cheek. he tuned himself to quirky moves he had taught himself as he danced to his jam.

 Suddenly, He was not there anymore. Not in a concert. definitely not surrounded by a crowd in a place lit with energy and noise. I had seen his conscious perish in smoke. Like magic. It was him, and his willingness to live infinitely alone in that moment that drew me towards him. I am convinced that he forgot that i was there. gazing. 

music to his ears and no one to see. Just how beautiful could a shy teenager inside a tall grown man be. It was a confession in the purest form.

Besides, for someone who became what was expected out of him and had to mature before he wanted to, i bet confessing meant everything.
and now i knew he craved for moments to feel alive, with nothing but a melody by his side.

Just like that, i had felt more than i should.

We got pretty close during the first weeks of Uni, and eventually she invited me over to study together.

But today, there's big corporations exploiting hundreds of millions (even more?) people in Asia, Africa... paying them close to nothing, in horrible working conditions, with no possibilities to get out of it, for their own profits obviously but also to make products that we do use and benefit from while we're perfectly aware of the conditions in which those products, that we blindly buy, have been made! Our cheap clothes, our computers, smartphones... have been made by slaves! You can call them workers all you want but you're telling yourself a lie, they're slave!
