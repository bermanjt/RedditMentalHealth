0,Fuck you reddit for putting at least one ad per page of this bullshit false advertising piece of shit. I'd rather see ads for fucking razor blades to kill myself with after having to see them all.,14Jul2019,2
1,"I moved to another country during my high school- college years. I had to struggle with a culture and language barrier. I don‚Äôt think I ever adapted because I‚Äôm naturally kind of a wallflower, and I never found out who I was or what kind of things I liked... I was in a kind of autopilot mode or survival mode, I honestly don‚Äôt remember much from that period of my life, I just remember not understanding much of what was going on at all...  
  
When I see other people on facebook or in daily life going about and able to make connections easily, I wonder if my formative years spent in a fog is different from them, and that‚Äôs why they connect more easily than I.  
  
It feels like I have to work twice as hard to connect, because I just didn‚Äôt have those years of ‚Äúmaterial‚Äù that everyone else did in their formative years, like collective experiences, not big things but small things, like unpleasant experiences, pleasant experiences, movies, music, media, things that I can share with other people and connect with them over. I just didn‚Äôt know what was going on or what I liked so... I don‚Äôt have many things that I can immediately talk my experience about.  
  
But then again, many other people are in similar predicaments to me. I suppose it is just another facet of life.  
  
All I want in life is to be able to relate with everyone in my life, but I understand this is impossible. I don‚Äôt even know why this is my goal. Perhaps because I feel chronically lonely and misunderstood. üôÉ",14Jul2019,2
2,"That's honestly it. If you have sympathy and advice I will gladly accept but don't get mad thinking that is what I'm looking for I just honestly wanted to put it out there. I wrote several other posts just venting and giving more information on what's troubling me and where I think this all stems from; But deep down I just wanted to put it out there. I struggle with my relationship with weed and alcohol and I honestly dream of a day where I can enjoy these things and not feel like they are tied to me and my existence.

3,"I have known this person a little bit over a month and we haven‚Äôt been in contact over a week. I tried calling him, then sent a few texts last Sunday, got no response.  

I‚Äôve done quite a lot for him and I would let him use me. I like him THAT much. He could use all of me and leave me completely empty. I wouldn‚Äôt care. I would give my everything to him, but I guess he doesn‚Äôt want it.  (I assume he knows I like him, but he doesn‚Äôt know that I like him this much)

I‚Äôm such a fucking dumbass. He‚Äôs most likely talking to his ex and tbh I wouldn‚Äôt even mind that IF I could be in contact with him. I just want to hear his voice once more.

I can‚Äôt get him out of my head. Why did my first actual love to be him? My stubborness isn‚Äôt helping this situation at all. I simply don‚Äôt want to let go. I aknowledge I would be way better without him but I still want to be around him.

For those of you that are in love or even just like a friend, and have been told by them that they aren't interested in you romantically or a relationship will never happen for whatever reason, but you continue a friendship with them, I have a whole new empathy for yall. It's fucking hard to be around someone you like/love, probably finding new things you love about them all the time, yet knowing nothing will ever come of it. In my specific situation, this person is in my core friend group. I feel like some sort of masochist for constantly wanting to be around this person, yet every time it fucking hurts.

I am pretty open about this, if you ask ""Is [insert name here] your alias?"" I can answer without lying, but I just like to pretend I'm a lot of people at once, just like drags, but only virtually.

10,"That's it. This seems like a possibility now.

I study film in college, I insisted myself to continue college and finishing it but I don't think I can do it anymore, I feel frustrated and lonely. Before college I had a job I really enjoyed, a job that I put a lot of effort in, some freelance kind of stuff, I know I use school as an excuse to not continue with my job because it scares me, I wanted to do things right and go to school, going for safety instead of actually risking anything, but today I was talking with a friend about all my frustrations and all my regrets about not going for what I really love doing and instead settling in a career, that while is not bad and it's quite fun, it's not how I really want to do things, it's not what I wanted out of life.

This thing of dropping out scares me, I know my family is going to be upset about it, but I really think that I should stop fooling myself and drop out, stop wasting money, and go back to what I really wanted to do, go for what I really wanted out of life. I'm trying to come up with a plan safe enough so I can move out and really dedicate to what I like.

It scares me, It's not a guarantee that it will work, but I know that with the skills I have, I can get a decent job and I will be fine, but not following the ""proper"" path gives me anxiety.

I feel like this is it, it's either all in or nothing, I don't want to be miserable anymore, I want to follow this no matter how painful it gets, at the end it's worth it.",14Jul2019,0

20,"About 10 years ago when I was a teenager I thought $100,000 was a crazy amount of money to have and it'd solve my problems. Today I'm in my mid-20s, I have $144,000 and I'm still me. I wanted to have a girlfriend a decade ago, today I still haven't kissed a girl. My teenage self would be shocked how I could achieve so much in one area, but so little another. 

My teenage self would be shocked that someone with money could still have problems and feel bad. I thought money would solve all my problems. It's allowed me to be stress-free in terms of personal finances, but it hasn't helped me beyond that. I still never had a girlfriend and never kissed, don't feel so good, etc... Prostitutes are not the answer. I want someone to share my life with. I'm now going the mail-order bride route. 

Money in some ways is so unmotivating to me. I could literally pay rent and eat for many years without work if I felt like it. Sometimes I wonder what motivates the rich to work when they clearly no longer need to. I guess I personally just continue to work to occupy my time since I lack a social life; in fact it's my only way to socialize. Also I view it as a real-life video game, with money being ""points.""

Money's allowing me to go to graduate school without thinking about finances, so that's nice. The American Dream is still around, at least in my case, I'm doing as well as my parents when they were in their 40s. (In previous posts I posted pictures of my balances as proof.)",14Jul2019,1

24,"I'm a guy in my mid 20's. I've had a few relationships in college from a few weeks to six months. By no means someone with a lot of experience but felt love for others. More often than not timing never worked out.

Around three years ago I gave up on dating. It just seemed an insurmountable task for two people in their 20's to be relatively stable and in the same place for any decent stretch of time. 

I've traveled a lot since then, often in a different country or state every few months. I met a lot of wonderful women and had some short flings that were great for what they were at the time but I wrote off any type of relationship as unrealistic.

I've been back in my hometown for a while now and plan to be here for at least a year. This weekend an old friend came into town and we had an impromptu dinner with a few folks.

Getting to the point... one of his old roommates showed up and I was just constantly stunned by her all night. I'd seen her at house parties and shows over the years but probably only small talked for a few minutes in all that time. The five us chatted for about six hours.

She was just beautiful, radiant, well read, had a wide range of interests, passionate about what she spoke about, had a sharp sense of humor, and seemed pretty fucking grounded and stable. After a bit, I got over my shell shocked nerves and was pretty affable and think I made a decent impression. 

But man I'm just shook. 

Would really love to get to know her and date? but it's been eons since I've been this instantly smitten. I'm still not really sure how I'd see her again without pulling something creepy or forcing some kind of group event. After I sobered up this morning and got through my hangover I just haven't been able to get her off my mind. Feels like that Beatles song ""I've Just Seen a Face""",14Jul2019,2

We think that this is her period but her period isnt due for like 2 weeks, but it also cant be spotting cause thats light and doesnt last very long.

So im in this stage rn were im anxious and dont want her to be pregnant and she wants the same.

Does anyone have any advice or anything they think this could be? Was this actually her period? What are her chances of getting pregnant?

34,"Hear me out if you'd like.  I grew up in a shitty environment, no parent guidance was poor. I had to struggle for most of my life, was just getting by on scraps and decided at 24 i needed to go to college. All in hopes that i can make enough money to do what I want. I am surprised i made it this far to be honest. Recently I have recently been lucky enough to get $3052 USD a month for, what is seems like, the rest of my life. Here is where I am stuck. I'm single and have no obligations other then rent, which my lease is ending soon, no biggie. The question is what should I do? So this may be a hard question to answer i know. If someone asked me this i'd tell them all sorts of things I would do! GO TRAVEL! SEE THE WORLD! DO SOMETHING YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO!!! Yet here i am.. and now and I don't know what to do. I don't know what to tell myself. Even after typing those ideas my mind just stops. Hell i am just realizing that I don't even know who I really am. Or I think i don't know, or I used to know.. I'm very much stuck in my own head and need some help. I never got to really pursue anything in my life that I enjoyed because lack of funding and guidance. I Had to raise myself. Now that I am free to do so I don't know what to do with my life. I have always been the one to take care of others and make sure they were mentally strong and happy that all these years i forgot to help myself. My friends have all drifted away or become too busy(so they say..) that i cant enjoy this freedom with them. 

  
So what? I am Usually the one to give solid advice but my mind just goes to a blank. I truly don't know what i like to do anymore. Its almost like nothing brings me real joy. I've been told that you should be happy being alone, but who wants that, I don't know if i could be happy alone. I have been going to the gym everyday for more then 3 hrs and it helps the mood i feel currently but its only temporary.  I have been advised that I should get a girlfriend or go on some dates but that seems like something that can wait. I am a good looking guy in great shape. Finding a girl has never been a problem for me, however I've avoided talking to girls at all since getting the money, seems like i need to figure myself out before settling down. (I sounded like a douche , sorry, just avoiding potential questions.)  


 I guess what I am trying to ask after this rant is what should i do next? Just push through my last 2 years of college, get my degree and it will come to me? Or should i take this time to figure myself out and i dunno travel? I really have been trying to set goals and find answers, I've been listening to Jordan Peterson a lot, he helps. It just feels like i had direction when pursuing money so i can enjoy life and now that step one, get money, is done. Step two seems like an abyss of crowded thoughts and uncertainty. I hope I figure it out, if you don't have a good answer then at least let me know if you can relate, Id like to not feel so alone in this.",14Jul2019,0
35,"So there‚Äôs this group of girls we used to hang out and get drunk with every weekend. One of the girls I‚Äôve always had a little thing for, not majorly (well at one point it was pretty major, but that died down pretty quick) but anytime we‚Äôre both out together there‚Äôs always been a kind of flirty vibe between us, for a long time we‚Äôve been the only two single people amongst our friends, and we just get along really well (although we didn‚Äôt like each other at first really lmfao). The thing is, due to some petty group drama that got out of hand between the girls, and the fact my friends are dating a few of them, everyone sees a lot less of each other due to the awkwardness of getting everyone together. It‚Äôs probably about once a month at the most now.

The thing is, on the rare occasions we do get together, it seems like this girl likes me even more. Absence makes the heart grow fonder and all that I guess. She always does this thing at parties where she‚Äôll run up behind me and give me a massive hug from behind as soon as she claps eyes on me, always says we all need to hang out together more, hell she even ‚Äòjoked‚Äô one time that if our friends refuse to be together then we should just go out on our own one day. A couple of weeks ago we pretended to be a couple because I was drunk and she thought there was more chance of us getting into a club if we walked up to it arm in arm and she vouched for me (I wasn‚Äôt that drunk for reference). Things are more flirty than ever between us, to the point all our friends have started to notice and comment on it. She‚Äôs always laughing overly hard at everything I say and it seems like there‚Äôs always just this tension between us. Recently I‚Äôve had people telling me to ask her out, and honestly I think there‚Äôs a good chance she‚Äôd say yes to a date. I‚Äôm far too scared to ever ask her out though, which is definitely something I should have grown out of at 21., but here we are anyway.

Anyway, last night we were at a party together, and I found her and a couple of my other friends outside. We all got talking, and I suppose me and this girl must have been flirting pretty blatantly, because our other friends audibly groaned and said ‚Äòfor fuck sake, when are you two gonna just kiss and get it out the way?‚Äô That probably should have felt awkward, but we just burst out laughing, both of us jokingly going ‚Äòewwwwwww‚Äô and finding it hilarious, but never actually saying that it wouldn‚Äôt happen. Our friends went on to say they were just gonna give us some ‚Äòalone time‚Äô, so they went back into the party while we stayed outside.

So there we are, sitting down while there‚Äôs a nice little breeze and the stars are out and all that shit, and I honestly don‚Äôt even remember what we talked about, but we sat there for at least 15 minutes, both of us probably thinking the exact same thing; if we were ever gonna kiss, this would probably be it. Our friends have basically left us to do it, and the fact we sat out together after that and didn‚Äôt go back inside says it all really. We don‚Äôt see each other that often, and we‚Äôre never alone like this. It was one of those conversations that just felt like it was leading up to the big moment; what we were talking about didn‚Äôt even matter, it was just a front; the tension was just building, and all I could think about was how much I wanted to just go for it. 

But before I got the chance, a couple of her friends who I don‚Äôt really know came out, not even knowing we were there at first, but they turned around and spotted us and started shooting the shit. The moment was gone. It was genuinely like something out some ‚Äòwill they, won‚Äôt they‚Äô rom-com or something, that moment in every romantic movie or series ever where they‚Äôre sitting there, the moment‚Äôs perfect, they‚Äôre about to finally kiss, and something interrupts them. I almost laughed at how fucking clich√© it all felt. I spent the rest of the night sitting thinking about it, how badly I wanted to make a move, and feeling stupid for letting the one good moment I‚Äôll probably ever get slip through my fingers. I knew I should have done something, and I just sat there doing nothing. It was pretty much [this moment out of Peep Show.](https://youtu.be/wbpVv1ytS3Q) 

Anyway, just wanted to vent. It‚Äôs now the next day, I‚Äôm hungover and feeling sorry for myself for passing up such a good opportunity. Life‚Äôs full of these little moments I suppose, where everything lines up for once and the universe kind of gives you the ‚Äòall clear‚Äô to for for it, fucking do what you want to do. It‚Äôs just kind of sad to watch them fly past you without reaching out and grabbing them.",14Jul2019,0

38,"(Throwaway because duh.) Its my first time creating a personal post so forgive me. (It turned to more of a ramble halfway through, so sorry about that.)

So. I (f19) realized I was technically assaulted a couple of months ago. It was between an older sibling (f with 5 yr difference) that I'm still close to and love. 

I (tw) woke up to it. There was kissing and groping going on before this, that Id be asked if i wanted to do. So growing up I thought it was a thing that happened. Like when you made out with your cousin when yo were younger. I never questioned it until they went to therapy and revealed to me that they thought they did and carried around this guilt. I started questioning it. Not remembering that the specific thing that was definitely was assault, happened, I didn't think it was. Especially since their therapist told them that it was common for kids who were abused (she was) to experiment, and explore, and as long as I didn't feel forced, it was fine. I mean.. I liked it so it was fine, right? (Again. Not remembering waking up and what was happening, hurting)

She told my mom of this as well. No one..talked to me about it, about specifics. My sister expressed her guilt. I reassured her. She told me she told mom. I wasn't so at least I didn't have to have that conversation. I remember my mom mentioning it to be. That she knew, with she was on the computer, playing one of her games late at night. I don't think she even looked up at me. And I remember it seeming like she was..upset about it. Upset at me?? But later told my sister that we wouldn't have been so close growing up if I did feel like she assaulted me. 

My thing..isn't the assault. There's no ptsd. Id come to the realization months back relying that experience to an ex and my best friend, which they confirmed that its assault. Its..the emotions with it. Accepting that you have been sexually assault, that it is in fact, child sexual assault. Having those labels. Yet..being afraid to open up to other people who went through it. Because they actually suffered. Because they have ptsd. Or talking to her, about it. Because that will impact her. Because she'll feel guilty and hold it over herself. And.. I don't want that. Id like to know why. The reasoning. What was going on. Thats what I want. And family and friends would want to know who, and when and how and... If I was honest. Then what? Would it break my family even more? Would I be invalidated? 

Its happened before. My step-mom, BIL, and my sisters best friend told me at least I wasn't sexually abused as a kid (This irony. Hurts.) like they were. When talking about how my dad was neglectful and how that made me feel about him. (Our relationship is a lot better now) Which frustrate me at the time. Because you're invalidating the pain I'm going through at the time, having to live through, because yours was worse. Yet. You've had years to try to cope with it. (I realize that just because they've had years doesn't mean that they've come to terms with it or coped with it or should, or it shouldn't hurt. Its just you're invalidating something I'm currently trying to process and deal with because you had something worse years ago.) Yet y'all constantly shit on my dad. Ever chance you get. Because hes horrible. And hes hurt my sister and mom and yadda yadda yadda. That falls under just another issue I have with them and my family which can be a post of its own. And guess the fuck what. I actually was sexually assault you fucking cum nugget. And it hasn't affected me and how I deal with shit and how I form connections like being fucking neglected. By everyone. Has. But I'm probably not suffering enough for them. I don't suffer from ptsd like they have. I don't hate the person who did it like they do. And, ""oh, your sister would never,"" ""she loves you"" or some toxic ass bullshit like that. 

Thats..why I think I'm so uncomfortable telling my story to a survivor? Trying to connect with them. And I hear about the bad. I don't hear about the technical ones, that didn't traumatize the victim. Like..""Oh, they did all of that horrible stuff, and you suffer all this ptsd from it? Oh well for me it was my sibling but I still love and care for them and don't want to hurt them with revealing it. \*shrugs\* c:"" Like..get invalidated by someone who went through something similar but it didn't mirror their own. Or. Be invalidated by family who went through it too if you did tell them who or the completely write you off. Or being pressured to tell, and then invalidated but you didn't suffer enough, even though the suffering is from having to accept it and.. this, right here. This anxiety. Feeling like I can't connect to anyone who was assaulted as well. Feeling like, it'll either hurt those I love and fuck shit up, or suffer through being told ""No. You're experience isn't good enough. You're not valid enough. I went through worse."" Or ""No you didn't. Because victims hate their abuser and you don't and everything is black and white and she wouldn't do that, you didn't think that before, why change your mind, you're doing it for attention. I'm a gas-lighting cunt"" Which. Either wouldn't be far off from previous behavior. Maybe not the attention part. At least from my mom. Others..idk. If I ever did speak up. 

And if thats the response I got... I'd cut them the fuck out. You're not going to invalidate something Id love to sweep under the rug and not deal with. But..It happened. It is what it is. I have these feeling. Those aren't going away. Its..always on my mind. in the back of my head. There's a free moment to think and its this. What it means. Or ""Im going to kill myself,"" or ""I should cut myself"" out of no where? Without a trigger. Without me thinking of something upsetting specifically. And its all upsetting. Its all stressful, and a lot. So it makes sense why it is here. But I feel..fine for the most part? Im functioning. I will continue to function through this. I recognize I'm struggling. I recognize I need help. But. I don't feel low. Low enough to actually worry about hurting myself. Or worry about it. Its weird. I feel fine. I feel okay, and then there's pop up ad in my head telling me to hurt myself? Like?? The fuck? Rude? And no? Its a lot, yeah. But bitch I made it this far without doing either one. we ain't fucking doing it now. Like. Bitch I can get through this. I just need help.

But with the anxiety stuff in the paragraph before, I realize that not everyone who went through something traumatic is traumatized and suffers through ptsd. And I realize that I'm currently suffering to process it. I can't call it abuse. when I can acknowledge technically it was. And I used them going through it was well as an excuse, until I realized if I was 9..they were 14. If I said no to kissing and groping because I knew it was wrong then...shouldn't..they have known? And asking myself why. Do I think they deserve to rot, and suffer for it? Absolutely not. Because they were 14. And 14 year olds aren't mature. Especially ones that went through sexual assault themselves. So its a gray area. 

The only person I feel comfortable talking about it to is my best friend. But I'm just saying my emotions. My feelings. I get to vent and work them out. But he isn't equipped with how to respond to any of this. Which is fine. Having an outlet helps. Him being okay with me talking about it, is still so fucking nice. I realize I need a therapist. I realize I need professional help. And I want it. But transportation is an issue since my day works weekdays. I'm saving money for a car, but I also gotta learn to drive the fucker and its in the plan. It is a goal. But it requires work and realistically will take a few months. And I need to talk. I so badly need to talk about it. 

If clarification is needed then I can provide. This went from one tone, to another, trying to cohesively tell my story to. A vent/ramble. Sorry bout that. In my defense..Its like 6:03 AM and I woke up at three and started this.

If me using humor..or trying..offends or insults anyone (because I'm anticipating it..its the internet. And..fucking reddit.) people use humor to cope. Not everyone process and deals with trauma the same. You're entitled to your opinion. Doesn't mean your opinion is fact.",14Jul2019,2
39,"Before I start, here's a little bit of context: Last Tuesday, I met a girl at a carnival who asked if I'd ever smoked weed before, to which I said no. She said that she liked getting people high for the first time, and I'd been wanting to for a little while now.

So today (well it's 6am but I haven't slept so I guess it was yesterday. We'll just say 7/13) we met at Dunkin donuts, and after our rides left, and after I got an iced coffee, we sat down in the parking lot and she got her stuff out and we smoked for a couple minutes. After that, we walked over to the carnival where we had met a few days before.

I felt so calm and relaxed and was smiling a bunch. I can barely describe how happy I was and still am. I seriously had the time of my life just riding rides and talking with her a bunch. We learned about each other and laughed a ton. We went on a ferris wheel and we were laughing so hard while she was telling stories about her family and I was talking about mine. I don't know what I was expecting, but I definitely had one of, if not the best day of my entire life. We even planned to do it again sometime with another one of our friends! I'm really excited and my summer is really looking up.

Then suddenly I realize I'm walking. 15km away from city along the road that was only for cars. How it's possible that I was able to walk all that way, find my way through city while being blacked out. I had put my jacket on, I had all my things, even my small bag. I thought that when one passes out it's pass out, not walk home like a robot. And because we have this music festival on our city the cops are all around and unlike my friend who was just drunk af got arrested like every other drunk, so I somehow must have looked sober enough not to get taken.

43,"I'm 20. Haven't been able to get a job (actually got banned from 2 places...), haven't been able to get a driver's license, don't know how to cook, barely know how to clean. It really hurts. I attend college and have a good GPA, but those things won't matter once college is over and I will have student loan debt to pay off when I graduate.

I know life's not a race, but I really hate not having a job (or some form of income), not knowing how to cook, and especially not having a license. Every single summer since I was 16, something has come up to make it impossible for me to get my license. And true that I don't have to take it in the summer, but the issues just never stopped. I was finally able to take the test as a college freshman, and failed it because the tires of my father's car were too worn. Now, this year/summer, his car will start decelerating at random times and he can't afford to get it fixed. The tires are also still the same ones that caused me to fail the test.

I really don't like being behind like this but I don't know what I can do to fix it. I'm thinking of contacting my mother (she got a new car, had me go to the dealership with her since she couldn't take my father, and to be clear, they are divorced). I'm thinking I'm gonna contact her even though we don't talk just to use her car to get the license. My mother and I really don't talk. She only calls me if my brother's not answering the phone because she only likes talking to him and had outright told him before that she doesn't like me (and that's never been a secret for me). She's the one that got me banned from the 2 restaurants because she knows the owner (same person owns both) and tried to get me a job at one of those places, but then we had an argument the day before I could have even been considered. I really really really hate being a pet, and I'm really limited for employment options by not having a driver's license.",14Jul2019,1

45,"I very rarely connect with people but have recently become close friends with an extrovert. It sucks because I really value our friendship but I feel like just another notch on the belt for her.

Recently, I helped her through hard times and in turn, I felt really good. She felt comfortable enough to express her vulnerability with me, which is rare territory for me since I typically don't share emotions with others.

Anyways, she made a social media post recently thanking her best friends for helping her get through a tough week. There was like eight people on the list. It just made me feel kinda cheap, like when some douchey guy rambles off all the women he has slept with and you find out you are one of them.

I am in no way faulting her for being extroverted and having a large support system around her. Maybe I'm just envious because I don't have anything close to that. That or I spend a lot of time thinking about her, her problems, and how to fix them, yet if I was out of her life, she likely wouldn't notice.",14Jul2019,5
46,"  

I'm a support worker who works with people with ASC (Autistic Spectrum Condition). One of my clients, Fred (not his real name), has an allotment he loves spending time at, tending to the vegetables and flowers there and making sure the place is always a neat and presentable environment to work in.  

It was a lovely sunny day down at the allotment, and Fred took out with some pride his weed burner with which he intended to scorch the undesirable plants growing between the cracks of the paved flooring.

I hadn't seen a weed burner until I started helping out at the allotment, and really it's just a long metal tube similar in form to a litter picking grabber, but with a can of butane attached to the handle, making it a flame thrower one can use in a residential setting. My fellow support worker at the time commented that together with the backpack I had on, I looked like a budget Ghostbuster.

As Fred scorched the weed-filled crevices to enhance the aesthetic of his plot, my colleague, who initially gazed on with interest at the intense blue flame making the weeds edges glow bright orange before gradually turning into charcoal, suddenly became acutely anxious at the sight of some insects that were living in the cracks, clambering to the surface and dispersing in panic. Ants, small spiders and woodlice all came rushing out looking for a place of refuge while the ladybirds wisely made emergency take-offs and took to the skies. My colleague, who I've since come to learn is a deeply empathetic person in all manner of respects, urged Fred to turn his weed burner off at once so she could take those insects closest to the flame away to a place of safety. Fred abided, and soon the insects had been gathered up and transferred to a nearby flower bed. After a short time, insects stopped emerging from the cracks that had received a taste of the burner's menace, and so Fred resumed his task again.

The urgency of my colleague's emotional response, and her efforts to rescue the insects before they became ash caused me to put myself in their shoes for a while and consider the experience the unfortunate ones on the front line with no time to escape had just been through. 

You're relaxing in a cosy little nook on a summer's day, undisturbed by the universe, sheltered from predators among the rogue blades of grass and dandelion leaves around you, maybe even snacking on a greenfly or two or just lounging on bean bags made of soil doing nothing, then, without warning, you look up to see a huge body from the heavens appear, casting a heavy shadow upon your world before a fire of biblical proportions rains down upon your neighborhood.

Imagining myself as one of those insects would leave me with a renewed perspective of religion while reflecting later that evening - the religion I was brought up to believe at least. I wondered how the insects might have responded if they had been brought up as atheists or as I was, a Catholic.

In the final brief moments before accepting they were about to die in the fire engulfing them, the atheist insects could be forgiven for assuming that this furnace from above they were powerless to stop, was simply a cold hard reality of life - that what was happening was a random and indiscriminate chance event which unfortunately for them just happened to be happening now. A natural disaster. 

""Such is life!"", exclaimed the woodlouse to the ant. 

""Oh woe is us! Nature is inherently cruel in its indifference towards our lot, and we are simply unlucky fodder at the mercy of its whims!"", lamented the spider to the earthworm; who hadn't heard a thing the spider had said as earthworms are stone deaf.

Similarly, the Catholic insects, not knowing why they were suddenly being torched, could also be forgiven for assuming there must be a reason why this blaze that seemed heaven sent wished to annihilate them. They might conclude, without any solid evidence of course, that the inferno had to be an act of God who had cause to take aim at them personally, a cause they'd probably appreciate a bit longer than a few seconds to work out. These undesirables had royally pissed off God somehow, but God couldn't be bothered to tell them what it was they had done. The rotter!

""The powers up above want to destroy our way of life!"", cried the ladybird with an air of authority rarely displayed before.

""Yes! This is no random happening. It is the intention of God to punish us for living the way that we do. This has happened to me before, but I was lucky to escape with only a charred wing. God hates those insects who choose to live in the cracks! He considers us lowlifes! This is no natural disaster I tell you! It is the work of a higher power! "", shrieked the greenfly in sheer desperation, while also maintaining a safe distance away from the ladybird, just in case.

And the Catholic insects would be pretty spot on in their assessment to a large extent. The inferno they were powerless to control wasn't a random event at all. There WAS a definite reason why it was taking place. And many more paving cracks would be left charred that day. The Catholic insects should also be forgiven for a second time - for envisaging an all-powerful, all-seeing God wielding complete dominion over their world, going potty behind the celestial controls because nothing winds him up more than insects communing among dandelions in narrow openings. 

You can't really expect a woodlouse or an ant, no matter how smart they are, to deduce that a person with a learning disability in a wheelchair, brandishing a weed burner only because their lack of mobility limits the degree to which they can participate in manual tasks, and whose aim is to simply to make their allotment prettier, is the reason for their suffering. It was never Fred's intention to knowingly destroy the habitat of another culture and claim it was necessary in order to serve a higher purpose - that of beauty. He would be truly mortified to find himself thinking in this way.",14Jul2019,2
47,"Hi. I'm a 24 year old male and for the last two months I've been sinking into a depressive state. I hope I'm not in the wrong subreddit.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel awful at my job lately. For the past 4 weeks I haven't had anything to do, literally anything. I go there, sit for 8 hours, then go home. Some days I have told my boss that I'd really like something to do, but there's absolutely nothing because they are sorting projects out.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not the only one who hasn't got nothing to do in this company, for reference. The pay is underwhelming, but I'd rather have this better than nothing. For the past few months I had been looking for a new job but I haven't been lucky. Some of them don't interview me at all, and the ones that do haven't called me back. As a programmer feel like I'm a skilled worker, that I'm passionate and that I know my craft, as much as someone with my experience can be. Looking for jobs makes me feel anxious and drains my energy a lot

&amp;#x200B;

I also feel quite lonely. I sometimes go out with some friends to the movies or drinking a beer, and they are cool, but somehow there's this void in my heart. I want someone I can develop a romantic relationship with. I want to care about someone and be cared for, but meeting people isn't easy for me. I've been on Tinder to find someone to date, but my looks are average, I guess can look somewhat good (but if you ask me, I feel like I'm underwhelming), I suffer from anxiety and having to put up a mask to pretend I'm confident feels awful, if I don't it goes just as bad. It crushes my self-esteem.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I am needy, I have problems to open up and be myself and I feel like no one would like me unless I somehow tricked them. I don't know what kinda person could fall in love with me anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

I have hobbies, interests and passions, but they're kinda niche, so it's not easy to connect with people. I'm a caring, empathetic person but lately I don't feel like myself. I don't know what I want or what I need anymore. I like to program webs, develop videogames, I enjoy learning about anything, cooking, reading, but I don't have energy for any of that at the moment. I find it so hard to concentrate, and it is even worse when my chest feels tight and I'm feeling bad.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been into therapy years ago. For that I had to go through the procedure of going to my GP and telling him about my depression and anxiety, asking him if I could send me to a psychologist, and watch his poker face as it's been the most awkward conversation I've had with any acquaintance. He did send me to a professional, a psychiatrist though. I was given drugs, that had positive and negative effects on me, however, this doctor would never listen to my feedback, he'd just dispatch me as soon as possible, sometimes tuning medication like if he was following a guide and changing some for others. He also never warned me benzodiazepines are addictive and you grow tolerance fairly quickly, had to learn that on my own despite that he recommended me to take them daily.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been 3 years without therapy of any kind now, and honestly I don't miss the drugs that much, I prefer to feel a bit worse and handle my feelings and moods through other practices like meditation, but I feel like I should get help again, but that's scary and honestly at the moment I don't think I can.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to write out some kind of conclusion or question, something positive but I don't know what. I know I should get my shit together and make an effort to be strong but right now it feels like a fucking mountain. Nobody will love someone who's laying down on his bed with intrusive thoughts out of the blue, yet the more I try to do anything, the more I hurt.

57,"Hi folks. Wanted somewhere to unload this because it's just been building up. Wonder if anyone else feels the same or has had similar experiences?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR at the bottom

&amp;#x200B;

For most of 2018 I was unemployed, found a job I really loved with the team I've ever worked with, until the contract soon went under after only 8 months. 250 people, out just like that.   


Being made redundant in your 20s in a job enjoyed and planned to stick with for a long while sucks hard. I took it as an opportunity to spread my wings and try new avenues. Soon after, I had an interview for a job at a solicitors and was successful in the interview (they called me up 2 hours after the interview to give me the job). As you can appreciate, I was soon to be out of a job before my current contract went under so I was quite happy to get this. I don't even have a law background, I studied English Language.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been an utter shambles since I've started. I feel stressed and isolated. My whole workings days are nothing but perpetual stress and anxiety, and my workload never goes does. The support is minimal. As a bit of background , this is a large law firm. One of a kind, really. It turns out they lost a lot of experienced staff (not very competitive pay). So, this firm I'm with had a huge recruitment campaign. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first thing that bothered me the most was the absolute lie of a full training programme. I only took this position in law up because that was promised once you start. I was keen to learn and start a new career path. 

&amp;#x200B;

From day one, I had a sinking feeling in my stomach. It started from a certain point and it's been further going south ever since. When I was walked onto my new floor, and lead to what was to be my new team, the team manager did not at any point of my walking into the room await me or acknowledge me. Despite knowing I was arriving he was totally engrossed with his work. I already felt totally disregarded and undervalued. Only when I was walked right over to him did he snap into awareness and address me, but as if I was an interruption to this current work. I get people are busy but to me this seemed outlandish to not greet or help a new colleague settle in.

&amp;#x200B;

From there, I was instructed to sit next to a part-timer and shadow him. Useless. The guy had as much enthusiasm as an euthanised sloth. From there on, I felt totally unsupported. The only training I really had was from whatever colleague I sat with. I was really expecting some sort of more thorough or formal training, or at least some guidance and support from my new team manager. This is a \*solicitors, a law firm\* for God's sake! Not a willy-nilly contact centre- how can you expect new workers to be handing such a sensitive field of work with no true guidance into the field? It's a glorified contact centre. 

&amp;#x200B;

It just gets worse and worse. There's no training campaign and the only half-arsed attempt is some podcasts the company produced. Useless, because I'm expected to get to work straight away and have no time to listen to them. My training in the day was a bother to my team manager. 

&amp;#x200B;

They seem to expect me to just 'pick' everything up. THIS IS A LAW FIRM. A SOLICITORS. IT'S LAW. YOU DON'T JUST 'PICK' THIS STUFF UP LIKE OTHER JOBS. OTHER PEOPLE STUDY THIS FOR YEARS. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's their approach: Have a learning buddy. Mine is always stressed or busy on the phone so he's rarely available. If he's unavailable, ask closest other colleague. Oh no- what's this, everyone else is busy on the phone and stressed to their eyeballs with paperwork because the company can't manage a sensible workload per colleague? Oh deary me, what shall I do now? 

&amp;#x200B;

NOTHING. I have to sit there with a raging, foaming-at-the-mouth client or third party company whilst I hope someone can help me out. Seriously- this is their approach, to just put the phone on hold and ask for help whenever I get stuck. Do they not realise how ineffective this approach is, and potentially detrimental to their clients and our workload? I even have colleagues telling me they're too busy to help out- I'm literally stranded at my desk with no help in sight. In just my first month, the most experienced file handler on my team had to take sick leave due to stress, and another very experienced file handler girl broke down and started crying. The team manager just walked past her with a cup of tea in his hands. 

&amp;#x200B;

In fact this is skipping one big event that really miffed me off. I had no- zilch, no formal training in basic company or business procedures before going on the phone to handle client queries. Absolutely, NONE- no scaffolding or support. There I am, sat doing my mundane paperwork, when all of a sudden the team manager gets up like he's just remembered something. Walks over to me and presses the button on my phone to take incoming calls. Just says, 'now it's your time to shine, just put it on hold if you ever get stuck'. Seriously, can you believe that? No easing into the task or real support or training? How the bloody hell am I going to talk LAW with clients when all I've been doing since I started is process everyone else's paperwork? 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate going to sleep at night knowing I have to go to work. I hate waking up in the morning because I'm waking up for work. I hate my lunch breaks because after one hour I'm back in the office. I hate buying my train pass because that's ¬£80 to go to the job I resent. I feel undervalued and worthless, if I float, I float. But if I sink they wouldn't think twice to help. I'm angry because I'm fed up of job hopping and just want something stable. The pay is quite good but I don't want to stay in a job I hate just for good pay.  

&amp;#x200B;

At work I pretend to smile and joke. I hate my team mates with a white hot anger, even the ones who are friendly and try to support me. I feel like a burden on everyone, every phone call gives me a huge spike of anxiety because it's always an angry client I don't know how to answer. My workload never goes down and my targets are never met because I'm always on the phone (this law firm makes us do TWO rolls in once- case manager and the tasks of a case assistant). Every day I'm feeling sick from the amount of anxiety and stress that cripples me for 8 constant hours a day. My head, with all the pressure and stress feels like a nuclear reactor about to blow. I hate my days off, I can't even enjoy them because I know I'm back to work soon. Even on my days off I can't enjoy them because a week of constant stress and anxiety doesn't shake off easily.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel confused, because I'm grateful to have a job and want to have a good work ethic. I'm not sure if I'm just being a whiny and incapable bugger or if this is a genuine problem. I feel like I can't even search for a new job because I've only been in this one for a month, and employers will wonder why I want to leave so soon. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Firm won't even let me progress or move to another department I'm more comfortable with because I'm in probation. I hate everything and everyone, I hate walking through the office and seeing others enjoying their roles on different departments or seeing those with supportive team managers.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Grieving over being made redundant, new job is very demanding with little support and the stress is killing me.

And then for about two days I‚Äôll be at my lowest point and feel bad about myself. I know that this is pretty normal for people my age, but it‚Äôs really gotten to me lately. I‚Äôm starting to wonder if there‚Äôs any point in trying being happy.

63,"I never tell this story. It's a crazy story, but absolutely true. I won't tell it to anybody in real life. Not to Hannah, who inspired it. Not to any friends. So I'm telling it here.

I am a 22 year old geek.

Last year I was a 21 year old, glasses-wearing geek who was a senior in college with nearly a 4.0 GPA. And I'm still (blush) admittedly a virgin. I'm only about 5'7, a ""studies-while-eating Doritos"" belly on an otherwise normal frame.

I told my friend Hannah about how I like to wake up very early on some days and head to the local nature preserve before class. I'm always alone, and it's beautiful.

She told me that her and her boyfriend used to go, and sometimes, she would strip to the nude.

My eyes bulged. She giggled and said it was not sexual at all. It allowed her to be ""one with nature"".

She said ""You should try it sometime, if you ever got the balls. Literally haha"".

Yeah right. I never even take my shirt off at the beach.

Then, one Tuesday morning at 6:30 am on a bright, sunny, only slightly brisk early Spring Tuesday morning...I got the itch.

I don't EVER do anything out of character. Why not just try it out? Nobody will ever know.

I actually undressed. I took off my heavy boots and long socks. My sweater. My pants. My undershirt.

There I was, shivering (it wasn't THAT cold, just a tad chilly, but the nerves got to me) in nothing but my light blue boxers.

I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and slid them down and kicked them off into the pile.

Now, clad in only my glasses and as bare as a newborn baby, I cupped my package with my hands, and I timidly walked towards the lake, about 50 yards from where I left my clothes, and I looked up at the gorgeous view.

The trees. The mountains. The beautiful, clear, blue lake.

Without even thinking, I placed my hands at my sides.

And there I was. Martin the virgin geek.

Naked.

Buck naked, in fact.

More naked than the trees, which were ""clothed"" in leaves.

More naked than Adam in the Garden of Eden, who at least had a fig leaf.

I was exposed. Not just physically, but exposed to new excitement and beauty.

Inspired, I even walked around the entire lake, as naked as the day I was born.

My round, bare belly shaking. My big, round, white-as-a-ghost ""bubble butt"" that Hannah would also make me blush over that she said I was always ""hiding"" under my nerdy khakis jiggling behind me. And my small package (hey, it's a throwaway!) bobbing in the brisk air.

I walked around the entire lake.

The crisp breeze occasionally startling me by caressing my bare butt. The tickle of a few flowers on my belly and package as I walked. The feel of the fresh grass through my bare feet as I walked.

Standing there, basking in the view, it was then that I heard it.

""Beautiful, simply beautiful.""

It was a woman. About 43 years old. Pretty, with a slight hard-to-pinpoint foreign accent.

She had a GIGANTIC, expensive, HD camera. And directly taking photos - OF ME!!!

I stood there frozen in shock, eyes wide, mouth open, as naked as a newborn baby with my hands at my sides in the bright sunshine for about 5 full seconds.

Then in a panic, I cupped my package with my hands and I ran behind a tree as she giggled and kept snapping photos of the scenery.

She must have gotten quite the eyeful of my full, round whiter-than-fresh-snow buttocks bouncing away like a coward.

I poked my head out from behind the large tree, hiding my vulnerable, naked body behind it, with the now colder breeze attacking my bald, defenseless white buttcheeks behind me.

""You can't take those pictures!""

She said ""I sure can, sweetie. We're out in a public space. Nobody forced you to go traipsing around in your birthday suit.""

I replied: ""You can't share those photos!!""

She said ""Relax, and don't be so embarrassed. I've seen many men in the nude over the years. I'm no virgin here.""

That made me blush beat red.

She said ""For ruining my carefully planned shoot, I'm going to use these photos to create a painting.""

As I spoke up, I felt my naked, white butt-cheeks jiggling as I was shaking in panic and anger.

I said: ""A painting?! Of what?"" as I clung desperately to the tree shielding my body from her gaze.

She smirked. ""A painting showcasing true bravery and vulnerability.""

I said ""I'm no model for a painting.""

She replied: ""Oh, but you are, nude boy. It's one thing for some confident, viking man to walk around here. You're not one of those types, with some big, silly penis flopping around to show off.""

I subconsciously placed a single hand over my package, even from behind the tree.

She said: ""But you. You're the true picture of vulnerability. Your lily-white skin. Your adorable chubby belly. A hint of a bosom on you, even with hard nipples in the cool air.""

She giggled. And I subconsciously used my other hand to hide my nipples like a damsel in distress.

""And your little penis exposed for the world to see. Standing fearlessly, without cover, in the open. Clothed by nothing but your smattering of body hair, and a slight, endearing pink blush across your cheeks. I'm going to paint you.""

My ""pink"" blush turning RED as I cried: ""But you can't!!""

She said ""I can, and I will. Google me."" She gave me her name.

""Your bare body will be in my gallery in a few months.""

Defeated, I said ""Well I'm going back around the lake, the least you can do is give my dignity and avert your eyes.""

She said ""I'll do no such thing. I have more photos to take. Now go run along, naked boy. Get that cute tushie running around the lake and get dressed, it's getting cold.""

As I ran around the entire lake, with absolutely no cover, feeling my bubble butt literally shaking behind me, I turned to see her unflinchingly smirking and staring at me. And even snapping a few more final photos.

A few months later, I did Google her, and sure enough, there I was.

A sight that a girl had never seen before, my naked body. It was expertly painted I must say, with unfortunately exquisite detail. A lush greenery set against beautiful mountains, with my blushing, eyes wide, mouth open, naked spectacle, arms at my sides, standing in front. My small penis and balls prominently displayed right in front.

With 2,000 favorites on her website. She displayed it in a gallery. It was sold for $5,600.

And it hangs right in the lobby of my town's city hall. Amazingly, nobody has noticed it's me. Or, they are too embarrassed to tell me...",14Jul2019,1
64,"I hate to be this whiney bitch, but I have to say something to someone, and I've done it too much to the people I love already.... 
People say when you hit rock bottom there's nowhere to go but up. That's not true. I've been keel hauled my entire life and I'm just sick of it. Every time I find something I like, or something that makes me happy, it gets stripped away so bitterly. I just really dont think I'm cut out for this whole life thing. 
The latest reasons why I'm feeling like this is 1st off. I had a job I could do. I enjoyed it. Loved it actually. Just landscaping. Nothing special but it weirdly enough felt like something I could live with myself doing. So I tried to be the best at it as I could. I signed up for classes that they would pay for hoping to advance in it. Well God decides he doesn't like me living life in a somewhat decent manner, so what happens? 2 hernias and a blown hydroseal. I dont think I was going too hard to deserve that kinda shit from my body, but it happened. And now everyone's generosity is running out, I love my parents and everyone to death, but they're getting sick of me needing help. I cant go back home, cant pay for my apartment, and cant get a job because I'm fucked up and nobody wants to hire me except shitty pyramid schemes, and shit that is too far away... oh and by the way my car is about to take a shit on me, and I have no money to do anything about it.

65,"Recently I've been on a search for mental clarity.  Each month I try to implement something new and positive into my life.  I've been attempting to form habits that will help me become the person I aspire to be.  It started with exercise.  What was 15 minutes 3 times a week is now 40 minutes 5 times a week.  I've lost 40 pounds over the last year and a half and feel in the best shape of my life. Next I started keeping a daily journal.  I've been capturing little moments that have passed me by, reprioritizing goals and tracking my time better.  This has resulted in clearer thinking, less anxiety, and generally a more productive lifestyle. Most recently I've been trying to read more.  I set out to read 30 minutes a day for 30 days.  I failed, miserably, some might say.  But I have been reading more consistently overall.  In the past 2 months I've read a total of 5 books which is what I read the entirety of last year.  While performing this exercise, this experiment, if you will, I started to reflect on some of the books that I've read that have left a lasting impact on my life.  Books that have influenced my ways of thinking and altered my decision making.  I made a film about it that's linked below.  It's an attempt to capture these thoughts, this process, and to share it with anyone who might relate.

66,I‚Äôve had problems this year staying on track and organized so I was just curious what little things do you guys do it keep it all together?,14Jul2019,1
67,"So there‚Äôs this group of girls we used to hang out with every weekend. One of the girls I‚Äôve always had a little thing for, not majorly (well at one point it was pretty major, but that died down pretty quick) but anytime we‚Äôre both out together there‚Äôs always been a kind of flirty vibe between us. For a long time we‚Äôve been the only two single people amongst our friends, and we just get along really well (although we didn‚Äôt like each other at first really lmfao). The thing is, due to some petty group drama that got out of hand between the girls, and the fact my friends are dating a few of them, everyone sees a lot less of each other due to the awkwardness of getting everyone together. It‚Äôs probably about once a month at the most now.

The thing is, on the rare occasions we do get together, it seems like this girl likes me even more. Absence makes the heart grow fonder and all that I guess. She always does this thing at parties where she‚Äôll run up behind me and give me a massive hug from behind as soon as she claps eyes on me and seems insanely excited to see me, she always says we all need to hang out together more, hell she even ‚Äòjoked‚Äô one time that if our friends refuse to be together then we should just go out on our own one day. A couple of weeks ago we pretended to be a couple because I was drunk and she thought there was more chance of us getting into a club if we walked up to it arm in arm and she vouched for me (I wasn‚Äôt that drunk for reference). Things are more flirty than ever between us, to the point all our friends have started to notice and comment on it. She‚Äôs always laughing overly hard at everything I say and it seems like there‚Äôs always just this tension between us. Recently I‚Äôve had people telling me to ask her out, and honestly I think there‚Äôs a good chance she‚Äôd say yes to a date. I‚Äôm far too scared to ever ask her out though, which is definitely something I should have grown out of at 21., but here we are.

Anyway, last night we were at a party together, and I found her and a couple of my other friends outside. We all got talking, and I suppose me and this girl must have been flirting pretty blatantly, because our other friends audibly groaned and said ‚Äòfor fuck sake, when are you two gonna just kiss and get it out the way?‚Äô That probably should have felt awkward, but we just burst out laughing, both of us jokingly going ‚Äòewwwwwww‚Äô and finding it hilarious, but never actually saying that it wouldn‚Äôt happen. Our friends went on to say they were just gonna give us some ‚Äòalone time‚Äô, so they went back into the party while we stayed outside.

So there we are, sitting down while there‚Äôs a nice little breeze and the stars are out and all that shit, and I honestly don‚Äôt even remember what we talked about, but we sat there for at least 15 minutes, both of us probably thinking the exact same thing; if we were ever gonna kiss, this would probably be it. There‚Äôs always a chance it was all in my stupid head, but bur friends basically left us to make some kind of move, and the fact we sat out together after that and didn‚Äôt go back inside says it all really. We don‚Äôt see each other that often, and we‚Äôre never alone like this. It was one of those conversations that just felt like it was leading up to the big moment; what we were talking about didn‚Äôt even matter, it was just a front; the tension was just building, and all I could think about was how much I wanted to just go for it. 

But before I got the chance, a couple of her friends who I don‚Äôt really know came out, not even knowing we were there at first, but they turned around and spotted us and started shooting the shit. The moment was gone. It was genuinely like something out some ‚Äòwill they, won‚Äôt they‚Äô rom-com or something, that moment in every romantic movie or series ever where they‚Äôre sitting there, the moment‚Äôs perfect, they‚Äôre about to finally kiss, and something interrupts them. I almost laughed at how fucking clich√© it all felt. I spent the rest of the night sitting thinking about it, how badly I wanted to make a move, and feeling stupid for letting the one good moment I‚Äôll probably ever get slip through my fingers. I knew I should have done something, and I just sat there doing nothing. It was pretty much [this moment out of Peep Show.](https://youtu.be/wbpVv1ytS3Q) 

Anyway, just wanted to vent. It‚Äôs now the next day, I‚Äôm hungover and feeling sorry for myself for passing up such a good opportunity. Life‚Äôs full of these little moments I suppose, where everything lines up for once and the universe kind of gives you the ‚Äòall clear‚Äô to for for it, fucking do what you want to do. It‚Äôs just kind of sad to watch them fly past you without reaching out and grabbing them.",14Jul2019,1
68,"I did a horrible act to one of my best friends and probably the kindest person I know, and now it‚Äôs not only messing up my life but the friendships and wellbeing of my closest group of friends.

After the act happened I pretty much split up the entire group, since some of them decided to still be friends with me, while others hated that idea. 

I don‚Äôt know if I can live with the guilt of messing up multiple amazing friendships, not only between me but also between others. 

I probably deserve to die for what I did to my friend as well.

72,"I grew up in a very prudish household raised by a single mother. I'd always felt most comfortable wearing pyjama bottoms or sweatpants. But because my testes sit kind of high, when wearing them it typically looked like I had a permanent semi as everything is pushed forward a bit. My mom, being super-religious thought I was being inappropriate, not realizing thats my natural state.. She made me feel ashamed of being male. She'd never directly mention it, but insinuate it by saying things like ""go have a cold shower"" or ""try to fast"". Other times she'd insinuate my mooseknuckle is caused by the devil thus throw religious quotes or scriptures at me. The fact she never mentioned directly her thoughts, but instead made indirect suggestive comments made my manbulge seem even more taboo.

Eventually, I was so ashamed of being male, I'd wear jeans in the home. Jeans were the only thing that made me appear flat down there. During the summer, when it was too hot to wear jeans, I'd wear shorts, but even then, I'd make sure to uptuck, meaning tucking my appendage into the waistband. From my late tweens up to this very day, I try to appear androgynous (or at least flat) down there.

I still read it but as a girl it‚Äôs so awful on my mental health. 

All day I read about how men see women as a collection of body parts, women can only offer youth and beauty, and once you reach age 25 you‚Äôre expired. If you‚Äôre ugly a man can‚Äôt truly love you, but only settle for you because he‚Äôs desperate. As soon as he finds a more attractive or younger girl he‚Äôll leave you.

77,"I had a house fire two months ago. The house is totally unlivable, so we‚Äôve had to move while we go through the rebuild process. Everyone is okay... We are super lucky. We didn‚Äôt lose anything irreplaceable. We have insurance, so we are okay there. We lost almost everything to smoke/water damage. Our furniture, clothing, and housewares all need to be replaced. The logistics of everything you have to do when you have a house fire is exhausting and overwhelming.  

I‚Äôm doing okay. Had a few emotional breakdowns, but not bad considering. 

However... I kind of need my family. I‚Äôm usually pretty independent, but I‚Äôm an emotional wreck at times. I know they care, but they sure as shit aren‚Äôt showing it. Lots of words, but I‚Äôve needed more than that. I‚Äôve tried to ask for help. They tell me all of the time that they don‚Äôt know I need things unless I ask. So I asked my mom for some help today. We talked about it on Thursday. 

My mom was supposed to help me pick paint today... She flaked on me to go kayaking with my step dad.   

It‚Äôs a beautiful day out. I don‚Äôt blame them, but I kind of need my mom right now.   

I couldn‚Äôt tell her that... You can‚Äôt be honest, direct, or candid with my mom. Her fee fees get hurt. So, I have to suck it up, and pretend I‚Äôm not hurt.  

In contrast, my husbands family has given us a roof over our head, and done so many little kindnesses to make this shit easier. We have disrupted their whole lives, and there is nothing but love and gratitude.

80,"A week ago I bought an electric scooter--a trike that you can ride from a standing position.   From the moment I assembled it and took my first ride, it's been my favorite thing in the world.  I've probably wracked up close to a 70 miles on it over the past week.  I rode it yesterday evening for an hour, just enjoying the summer night air and the illusion of freedom.  

I was going to take it out for a spin this morning.  I was going to ride across the river and check out a new waffle place for breakfast.  But it wouldn't start.   Not wanting to panic, I instantly diagnosed the problem as a drained battery (even though I charged it last night) and plugged in the charger.  Nothing.  It's dead.   My brand new scooter is dead for some reason.  :(

It's funny.  My life was completely fine before I got this thing.  But now that it's not working, I feel so empty.  Mind you, it's not like I need this scooter to get to work.  It is just a toy.  But this toy has become a part of me.  I'm sitting here thinking about how boring my life will be if I can't get it fixed.  

It's hilarious how melodramatic I'm being, I guess.  But my feelings are making me realize that my scooter isn't just a scooter for me.  I feel young when I ride.  I feel like a daredevil, like someone who is down for whatever.  I enjoy riding around in neighborhoods I've never been to before, seeing things I've never seen before, waving at people who never seen me before.  My scooter took me to restaurants I'd always wanted to check out, but that I've always avoided due to sparse car parking.  I like the compliments I get from passerbys who were impressed to see a 40-something woman riding on a gizmo popular with the 20-something set.  More than one person has seen me waiting at a light and has said something like, ""I want one of those!""  And I enjoy the youthful thrill of cruising downhill and making it to the bottom in one piece.

I've contacted the company who sold me the scooter to see if they can help me feel better about this disappointing turn of events.  I've also found a repair shop that I'm hoping will be able to help me, just in case the company jerks me around.  Regardless what happens, everything is going to be OK.  It's just a toy.  I can always save up for another one, if it comes to that.  

But I'm not gonna lie.  I am sad!  This whole thing reminds me how sometimes it's really the smallest things that make life amazing.

Hopefully by the time I get my scooter fixed, I will find something else to fill the void.  Cuz this feeling sucks.",14Jul2019,2

Up  until 10th grade, I was a very smart kid. I used to get really good  grades. I used to actively participate in competitions and win them. Be  it debates, speeches, skits. I was extremely studious. I even had  leadership qualities.

When I moved to  11th grade, I had to shift to a new place. There the studies were hard  and teachers weren't great. I lost the drive to study. I ended up  scoring really bad in 10th grade.

That  has killed me. The 95+ kid got marks in 70s. That has killed me. It has  shattered me. During this time, my girlfriend also broke up with me and  betrayed me (there's a history). Long story short, I was stabbed and i  can't trust anyone.

I know I'm smart. I  know I'm capable. Way more capable than others of achieving my goals.  But I feel powerless and directionless and betrayed. I don't really talk  to anyone about this because I'm introverted.  I dont know how to gain  my confidence back. I want the 10th grade me back GOD please.",14Jul2019,1
82,"Hello! i am 15 years old and i just want to just let this out because i cannot stand myself being in my house alone after school all my life

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a very small neighborhood next to train tracks in the outskirts of a city. the road goes to a interstate. And for the past few years i've been just dreaming to go to a friends/girlfriends house. But for some reason my parents just dont let me. They know i do not have ANYONE around here, yet they still dont let me go somewhere once in my goddamned life. For all my life i've been in the house, the place i go to the most is school and a recreational center after school and then i am at home. all day, everyday. Ive never went to a friend's house since i was in kindergarden, i am a highschooler and i still do not go to a house or in a neighborhood. I have really really big issues of me not living in the suburbs with my friends and go to the city on my own and go to anyone's house. No i live far away from it and when i ask for a ride anywhere my parents go crazy saying ""You might get kidnapped, I dont trust you around girls!"" Etc. Yeah they do care for me and i respect them for that. But i am coming to adulthood i am almost fully mature i am smart. Yet they still say no and say the same reasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

You might take this as them caring. But i take this as them insulting my intelligance thinking i am gullible thinking i cannot survive alone with friends for a few hours. Sometimes i get into extreme anger and rants about how i cannot meet my friends since i live so far away from them. It gets me up at night and it gets me angry. Because having friends is the only thing that gets me out of the bed. I love them half to death and if any of them die or something tragic happens i will be devastated. Without them i would be nothing, alone. Doing nothing except getting mad and sad.

&amp;#x200B;

This post might seem very stupid and angsty just wanted to let my feelings out on why i can never meet my friends.

Thank you for your time.",14Jul2019,1

91,"Like the title says, how do I make myself be ok with being alone?

I've never had much luck in the dating scene. I had a few short-term relationships in college, but those only lasted a few weeks. Normally this hasn't really bothered me too much. I have friends, I have a dog, I have hobbies, and I have a job I enjoy to keep me busy.

Lately, though, I just can't help but feel *very* lonesome. I see my friends with their relationships, my little brother has a very steady relationship going on right now (they make a really cute couple and I'm super proud of him,) and my parents and grandparents will make the typical ""so you have a girlfriend"" comments every now and then when we talk on the phone. It just feels like I'm somehow failing or doing something wrong by not having a girlfriend, even though I know it's not the case.

I have friends and a family that are very supportive no matter what I do, and I'm really thankful for that. But it doesn't help that sense of loneliness go away. How do I make myself be ok without a romantic partner? I guess it's kind of a sense like I'm missing out on something, if that makes sense. I know I don't need a significant other to be happy of a complete person, but telling myself that hasn't made me feel less alone.

Sorry if this is the wrong place to put this, by the way.",14Jul2019,0

96,"Having said that-- I just considered the whole thing and wondered-- I mean, I've always had some issues with things and could get rather extreme-- but this will be my third night in a row with no sleep-- my second spent sitting uncomfortably outside my apartment only using it to charge my phone-- not eating from my own food supply or using my own restroom for more than VERY quick emergency stops. I just had a genuinely frightening thought. Is this the moment when I have quite literally fully snapped? I think I felt the world actually kinda disassociate for a second or two there. Not joking. I mean, I also very badly need sleep, I am well aware-- but is that a symptom of my usual hyper reactiveness, or have I finally genuinely lost it? If I haven't yet, am I GOING TO? What happens then? I am going to make an attempt to reach out for help tomorrow-- the place was closed to day. First we see about a bed and some sleep-- then we sort out if I've returned to relatively normal in a day or two. If not... Well, they're in that business as well. Don't know if I can survive another night like this-- and this one'll be even worse-- cold hard metal chair rather than a stair landing I could at least lean back and stretch out on. I am way too far gone to use my own shower-- but I can't walk in there in these clothes and smelling like a fish dump. If they get me a bed somewhere-- any clothes I wear will now be a danger for bringing the infestation with me-- it already happened once the second day of my last hotel stay, dead serious, it's that bad here. Sorry if I freak anybody out with this psychotic bullshit here. But think about how I feel...",14Jul2019,3
97,A few days ago my girlfriend broke up with me. The day that happened was one of the only good days I had in a long time till that point. No I wasn't happy we broke up but something in me fired up and it gave the motivation to push on and start learning to code. Her leaving me gave me the motivation to push on and make myself better and more wanted by other women. But today and yesterday I've hit a wall. I know the second I let myself stop being positive I'm done. I know I'll be stuck in that same suicidal depressive rut as before and I can't let that happen.,14Jul2019,2
