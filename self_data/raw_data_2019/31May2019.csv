I remember when I got my FIRST job and she was super excited and congratulating me and it made me feel good and I guess I was let down when I didn't get that same reaction out of her this time.

I guess I am 25 and grown-ass adult so maybe I shouldn't expect a big high five or something?",31May2019,3
1,"I don't want people to think that I think that I'm psychic. I don't believe in that mumbo jumbo. However, I do believe in what I see and hear happen. My intuition isn't all in my head and it's not just a coincidence. I just don't know how to maximize it to it's greatest potential to benefit me (or anyone else). What would *you* do if you could sense things before they happen? If you could tell that a dog is about to come from behind a bush without ever seeing or hearing it? That you can tell that the car in front of you is about to get a flat and swerve without seeing any signs of it? Or that the box of food you're holding is spoiled without smelling anything or ever having looked at the expiration date? Yes, I know that these are mundane things. Like I said, I'm not claiming it to be anything psychic or major. I just need to know how I should handle it.",31May2019,2

6,"I got my first tattoo a little over a month ago, absolutely love it but there were some issues during the healing process and it‚Äôs not as neat as I hoped it would end up being.

My tattoo artist told me I can get a touch up for free if anything were to happen within six months of the first appointment, but he hasn‚Äôt answered my messages on Instagram and when he does it‚Äôs always ‚Äúmessage me tomorrow to coordinate an appointment‚Äù but then doesn‚Äôt answer when I do.

Last I heard from him was on May 19th, his last message was ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you know what time I have free for your appointment‚Äù. Still nothing.

Should I wait for a little more or try to find another tattoo artist to give me the touch up?",31May2019,1

For the first time ever. 349 days of character development. I‚Äôve learned so much on my own, and from friends and family. The trials and tribulations I‚Äôve gone through, the smiles and laughter i have experienced. I‚Äôve had feelings in New York I‚Äôve never known before. Love that knows no boundaries. Pain that‚Äôs caused many sleepless nights. Everyone is so scared to leave home and try something new, but by god, it‚Äôs the best damn thing I‚Äôve ever done in my life. I‚Äôve never been a better mom than I am now. Ive never been as seemingly weak, but that‚Äôs what makes me grow so much stronger.

18,"I struggled when I was in high school and college to begin with. I was achieving great academic grades however I just didn‚Äôt enjoy school.

I left high school with top grades (age 16) and I enrolled straight into a top college... biggest mistake but biggest lesson learnt of my life. I went here for reputation, and not because I wanted to. 4 months later I left the college... I absolutely hated it and I just wasn‚Äôt enjoying myself. My parents were furious with me for ‚Äúwasting my knowledge‚Äù...

I was unemployed for 16 months. I was applying and applying all day every day and I just wasn‚Äôt getting any luck. No one wanted me because of my high school grades being my only grades for my age, but as well as the fact that I just didn‚Äôt want to apply at a fast food restaurant. I didn‚Äôt want to seep away in a dead-end job. My parents again were angry, but I was a man with a plan.

I turned 18 and I began working at a pharmacy. I‚Äôd always ask the pharmacist questions on the drugs, to increase my knowledge. My co-workers would come in at 8am, and leave at 6pm no questions asked. Me on the other hand would be so god damn curious I began itching to enrol back into college and not mess it up this time

I enrol back into college, and yet again my parents were angry for me wasting a full time job. By now people my age (18) are in their first year of university. Instead, I‚Äôm in a college class with 16 year olds and as you can gather I was levels higher in terms of maturity. I didn‚Äôt enjoy it but I knew what my plan was.

2 years later and I pass with the highest possible grades for my course. Teachers were overwhelmed, and pushed me and guided me to go to university. 

Now I have just completed my first year of university studying Biochemistry. I couldn‚Äôt be anymore prouder of myself and I have learnt one thing:

19,"To the drama teacher I had since sixth grade. To the person who introduced me to the world of musical theater. To the person who left such a big impact on my life that they are a part of the reason why I started singing and performing. Without him, I never would‚Äôve set foot on a stage. Without him, I never would have joined choir. Without him, I never would‚Äôve written my first song or joined my first band. I would‚Äôve never discovered my passion for music. 

A lot of the times people think they don‚Äôt make an impact in this world. That you have to be big and loud and known in order to make a difference. Today, I realize how untrue that is. My drama teacher‚Äôs name won‚Äôt go down in history books or be big news. He might not realize it, but he changed my life. And he likely changed many others lives, without knowing it. He is part of the reason why I‚Äôm where I‚Äôm at today. 

Today I realized that if one person can leave such an impact on my life, then that means I can have an impact as well. That you don‚Äôt have to leave a legacy in order to have a lasting, positive impact on someone‚Äôs life.

23,"TL; DR at the end.

I have never done this because I am a private person, but this is too surprising for me to hold in.  

The CEO of H's job hates them.  We believe it is for a specific reason that is illegal.  We can't prove it yet.

Well, the other day the CEO made A the manager over the warehouse.  A is liked by most people.  We thought he made A manager over all department in the building that the warehouse is in.  Instead we found out from A that A is only over the warehouse, not the related departments.  

Instead the CEO made M the manager over some of the related departments.  

Well, H is the only person cross trained in all parts of the warehouse, which is a bit more complicated than your regular warehouse.  H knows all the workers, none of the workers have issues with H even though H is their supervisor, H knows HR laws, accounting, transportation, and logistics, and H is the only person who knows how to run some parts of the warehouse and related departments due to attrition.  

A said that one of the senior managers said in a senior managers meeting, ""We can't lose H right now, we will be in big trouble.""  But the CEO won't do anything positive for H.  

Well, H was able to speak with A today and said that they were tired of the horrible schedule that H was on (Mon off, Tues swing, Wed day, Thurs swing, Fri day, Sat swing). 

 H thought that A was going to be a team player and try to talk H into continuing the schedule, but instead A stated that H was actually on part time loan to the department that M now manages and A could find some reason why H was needed full time in the department that A manages.  

H said, ""But I am the only person that knows that process other than J"" (J is being trained for that department by H, so H knows more about the position than J.)  Remember that A is liked by everyone.  The kicker came today when A said, ""Well that is M's problem, now isn't it?""  After that, H realized that M had burnt bridges with A.  

This means that M won't have anyone to work that position for two crucial days a week  except for J who is being trained by H and likes H.  

TL;DR

Thought that new department boss would give the old ""Be a team player"" line to my friend who deserved the promotion, instead new boss is out to f\*\*\* another department boss and say, ""That's your problem"" leaving that department boss in dire straits.  LOL!",31May2019,1

Today sucked.  Today was stressful.  Today I swearing at my computer.

I have my own 'fifedom' as does my father how ever he does other things while i take care of his feudal  estate as well . in feudal society blood shed is commonplace how ever in Western society such things are far from the normal. . Bribery and betrayal is also a norm of feudal society so one must always be at ones brightest to live in a feudal society. In Societies not touched by feudalism safety and quality of life are measured with comfort and displeasure ,monetary surpluses also add to western societies being portrayed as the best places where one can live there life. Most of my family agree with this assertion. I disagree because for one all of the comforts of the west are available in a prosperous feudal society . Living in a place with a minimal amount of blood shed and feuds tribal and other wise also weakens the members of that society . Safety is also present where ever a strong feudal lives as the blood shed under a stronger feudal would be controlled and would only be present if the people under him are threatened or as a way for a feudal to show his strength.  The west is how ever a better place to live if one feels that safety stems from a lack of conflict . Conflict will never stifle ones safety as conflict is in all facets of society .

&amp;#x200B;

So as a precursor, my boyfriend is in away for 5 weeks for training.  I know it's not that long, but it's really the longest he's been gone since we moved in together and he's literally my best friend and we don't get to talk much while he's out there.  I can't sleep in bed without him because I get horrific night terrors, so I've been sleeping on the couch for almost 2 weeks now.  My sleep has become more and more disrupted and my energy levels are very quickly deteriorating. 

&amp;#x200B;

The day he left was my little brother's soon-to-be wife's bridal shower.  My mom picked me up and we broke there together.  On the way home we got into it because she brought up my failed marriage and acted like she didn't take my ex-husband's side for the entirety of the divorce (which is especially bothersome when you factor in that I left him because he cheated on me....while I was recovering from major surgery....to remove cancer).  To be honest, I'm not even mad about what she did back then, just the fact that she refuses to apologize or even acknowledge how she acted.  Saying things like ""oh I don't recall it happening like that"".

&amp;#x200B;

Last Monday I started training for a new position at my job.  I was only training there 2 days last week because we were short man-power, but I was the biggest derp both of those days and I'm pretty sure my one coworker (the one training me) hates me now and is talking a bunch of shit.

&amp;#x200B;

Last Tuesday it was 90 degrees Fahrenheit , I went to turn on the A/C....Nope. Not turning on and I couldn't order a new one until Thursday because I needed to get paid.  It's been almost 90 every day since then.

&amp;#x200B;

This Monday I realized there was a stain on the dress I bought for my brother's wedding (which is this coming Saturday) and in an attempt to clean it, the colors started to run and now the stain is bigger.  Couldn't find a receipt so I went to the store and thankfully was able to find the same dress.  The stained one is getting returned the the new one's receipt... So I guess that's a good thing.  But at the time I was extremely frustrated.

&amp;#x200B;

Tuesday I started online college courses back up, except the site keeps freezing up on me.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday my new A/C came.  The box weighted 70lbs.  My boyfriend is not home.  I live on a 2nd floor apartment.  My thigh is pretty completely covered in bruises  because I had to use it to get leverage while trying to get the damn thing up the steps.  (Did I mention I have a wedding to go to on Saturday?)

&amp;#x200B;

And finally... Today.  Today was actually okay for the most part.  I got some homework done, not a lot, but some.... So I guess that counts for something.  I went to work, I was training again and I actually felt like I was doing okay.  I was only ever stumped one time, but it was on a weird assignment and even the guy training me seemed a little unsure of how to phrase the notification we had to write to the supervisors... But then I came home.  I came with the intention of doing more homework, deep conditioning my hair, crocheting, and watching bad shows on Netflix.  I walk into the kitchen to take out the trash and there is water all over the floor.  The refrigerator we bought less than a year ago is leaking everywhere and I have no idea how to fix it.  I've tried googling to no avail...and I'm just hoping someone on the appliance repair subreddit gets back to me asap.

&amp;#x200B;

34," 

I was dating my boyfriend for over a year when this happend. High school hormones run high so we were sexually active. My mother is an extreme Christian and expected me to be a virgin until marriage. No joke. So naturally, I kept it a secret from her.

One night I was experiencing extreme sharp pains in my lower right side. It didn‚Äôt go away after a couple of days but my mom wouldn‚Äôt take me to the hospital. She‚Äôs the kind of person who won‚Äôt spend money on a doctors appointment unless I have a high fever, a broken bone, or blood coming out of a place that blood isn‚Äôt supposed to come out of. So I went to my boyfriends house to relax with him and my side pains got so bad that I curled up in the fetal position and started crying. My boyfriends mom decided to call my mom and tell her she was going to take me to the hospital. My mom finally felt guilty (I‚Äôm guessing) and ended up taking me herself.

We got a room and told one of the nurses my symptoms. The nurse then asked if I wanted my mom in the room during my exam or if I would like her to wait outside. My mom gave me the death glare and clenched her jaw which pretty much told me I had no choice but to tell the nurse she could stay. I think the nurse noticed this as well. My moms face went from concern to anger in a flash.

The nurse left and came back with another nurse to accompany her with my exam. Nurse 1 came to my bedside and took my blood pressure while Nurse 2 stood in front of my mom, standing back to back with Nurse 1. Their strategic standing positions made it to where my mom wouldn‚Äôt be able to hear the conversation between me and Nurse 1. Nurse 2 began loudly explaining to my mom what may be causing my side pains. (appendicitis) While my mom was concentrating on Nurse 2, Nurse 1 quietly bent close to me and asked me if I was sexually active. I said yes. She nodded and left the room. My mom was non the wiser. They gave me an ultrasound and we found out that I had cysts in my ovaries. They gave me some pain meds and I went home.

I was so grateful for those nurses that day. They had a plan and executed it beautifully to save me from a nightmare. I wasn‚Äôt ready to tell my mom about my sex life, and they helped me keep that secret so that I could tell her when I was ready. Nurses are amazing.

Edit: Some people are wondering why the nurse asked if I was sexually active if ovarian cysts have nothing to do with being sexually active. The nurses didn‚Äôt know what was wrong at the time they asked the question. My symptoms could have been due to many things; An ectopic pregnancy, appendicitis, ovarian cysts, kidney infection, and I‚Äôm sure many more. They need to ask a multitude of questions to understand what is going on and to see if they can rule out any possibilities.",31May2019,0

I hate how my studies are the central focus of my family now and basically my performance affects my parents. My dad has blood pressure problems and had to get on medication. My parents want me to get 5 out of 6 As. I‚Äôve only been successful for 4. The other two, Math and Spanish are their own thing. Math is impossible because I‚Äôm busy trying to keep a B. Spanish my teacher likes to find a way to screw us over all the time and I‚Äôve kinda accepted I won‚Äôt get past it so I‚Äôll just take 4 As and 2 Bs.

I feel like all I‚Äôm worth is grades. I have this crap pushed into me everyday at school as everyone stresses over it and talks about it. I once had a breakdown at home saying all I feel I‚Äôm worth to this world is the grades I get and how much of a wage slave I can be in the future. I already am a slave to the education system.

I don‚Äôt have many friends in person and most of the people I talk to except one person, I met online. It‚Äôs purely text conversation.

2019 has absolutely sucked so far. I couldn‚Äôt have imagined a worse year, and to be honest I‚Äôve no idea how I‚Äôm carrying on each day.

I lived in a housing project at the time &amp; the cops rarely ever came around so it was common for ppl to hangout get drunk &amp; high in the open. Everything was fine until about 2 am him &amp; few others with us decided it was fun whoop some kids ass that just got dropped off from the club. Things turned to chaos quick, neighbors were coming outside from hearing the man scream, we left to my house til things calmed down until someone came by &amp; said ‚Äúppl down the street said they are coming to shoot your house‚Äù so me being high on Xanax decided I would confront who ever said it.

50,"I want to write this down before the feeling completely fades away with the stress of finals and work. 

I haven‚Äôt seen my best friend in 10 years, maybe more. We had a falling out over a guy when we were 16. This guy treats us both like crap and was a major creep. He ended up assaulting me, and I had already cut ties with my friend concerning him, but also because she was having substance problems and I couldn‚Äôt deal. It was a mess. We reconciled a year or so later, but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to get close to her again because of the trauma I experienced from this guy we both knew. I was both ashamed that our falling out was over this complete lack of human life, and that I couldn‚Äôt be there for her, even though I know I was still just a kid. 

I‚Äôve always wanted to tell her what happened in greater detail, maybe I will some day. The guy stalked me for over 7 years and I was terrified of talking to anyone we both mutually knew. My best friend included. It was like he kept finding new ways to get to me and track me down. I had to move cities and change my number. I went to therapy for sexual assault and domestic violence. It was a horrible time. 

The real reason we had a falling out, on my end, was because I was extremely lonely. I was being abused at home by my mom and my best friend wasn‚Äôt around much anymore. I knew she had her own life stuff going on. Sometimes they were too heavy for 16 year old me. So I ended up latching into anyone who would give me attention. Bad idea. It‚Äôs always a bad idea. When you grow up, you realize self worth is the most powerful thing you will ever need to know. 

Truth is I‚Äôve neglected a lot of friendships over the years, not by choice, exactly, but I have. I had to move form my home town ended up being isolated with my abuser . At the same time, the guy who assaulted me was still stalking me. Moving away form my small support system completely changed who I was. I don‚Äôt know if it was for the better, yet. I finally got away from both of my abusers. But I feel like it came at a price. I haven‚Äôt been able to see any of my close friends in years. Years, and it feels awful. I feel like I‚Äôve completely shut myself off from feeling and from just, whoever I used to be. Whatever that means anymore. 


I do like who I am now, more then I like who I was. Who I am now is someone who knows her self worth and is willing to fight for her freedom. 
But lately my mental health has started to take a dive down again, and I don‚Äôt feel confident or safe in any of my choices. It feels like I‚Äôm getting nowhere fast and that I‚Äôm doomed to feel like a mess, and to be cut off. I‚Äôve been feeling extremely numb lately and that scares me. 


My best friend don‚Äôt come into the state very often. Maybe every couple years. We decided to meet up in our home town. I was really nervous and I have so many feelings regarding how I treated her and my regrets. 

But it‚Äôs like we didn‚Äôt miss a single day all these years. 

We hiked up into the woods to talk for a couple hours. I went there recently with my boyfriend, and very time I‚Äôve been there, it felt like the woods were a different, foreign place. Not this time. They made sense again. It felt like a place I‚Äôd always been. I felt safe.
There were other people out and about in various parts today the trails, drinking, smoking, hanging out. It didn‚Äôt make me feel on edge. It just felt like, the whole world had it‚Äôs one little pockets of people doing exactly what we were doing. 

We talked for a while and she told me that she though we were definitely closer then just regular friends back then. I‚Äôd always hoped she thought of me as a best friend. Losing her was so painful because she was my best friend. She was some of the first people I ever confided in about my home situation. So much of who I am now, she was around to see. We‚Äôve known each other for 17 years. I‚Äôm just so happy that we still know each other. And I regret missing so much time with her. We had promised, way back then,  that when we were old and our husbands had departed or whatever, we‚Äôd live together in a house full of cats and do whatever the hell we wanted. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll be like when I‚Äôm old. But I hope I‚Äôm still a person who can jump into a conversation with her like we never missed a single day. 


This fault feeling of some of my memories is lingering with me right now, things I sort of forgot because of joe hectic my life had been these last 7 years. Things I don‚Äôt want to forget. Things that make me smile. Things I get nostalgic about. 


I tripped on some uneven pavement on our way down and she help my hand for a minute to help me walk. I stupidly left my distance glasses in the car. This friend of mine was the first person to hold my hand after years of not having any physical contact with other people, back when I was a child. Her hand still feels the same. 

Our home town is changing. Places we used to hang out at are fine and disappearing, parts of town that were ghetto are all gentrified now, some nicer areas are getting unsafe, the rent is going up and we can‚Äôt even live there because it‚Äôs so high and it won‚Äôt stop soaring. But some things don‚Äôt change. 

The Ralph‚Äôs on lake still has sushi, the hiking trails are the same, the woods seem happy when friends are gathered in it, and my friends are still living their lives in the best ways they know how. No matter if they still live here or are hundreds of miles away. 

They‚Äôre the reason I stayed sane during my worst years. They‚Äôre the reason I ended up wanting to stay in a town I used to feel completely alone in, after I realized there was no other place in the world like my home town. 

But now I know it‚Äôs not the city. I had convinced myself after all these years that I was fine going anywhere. But really, I just missed my friend. I‚Äôve missed my best friends. And I it wasn‚Äôt the city that I loved, it really, truly was the people that filled it with live and made it home. It‚Äôs just sucked so much without these people. I wanted to be really independent, and okay without them. But I really, really miss them. And I‚Äôm going to try my best to hold onto them for as long as I can. Even on days my mental health is absolutely shit. Or during work weeks that feel like they won‚Äôt end. 


The city made sense again, I felt like I came back again, and I‚Äôm more present now than I have been in weeks. I felt like I was home again because someone that really matters to me was back. And I know I can feel like home is whenever I‚Äôm me, and I‚Äôm me as long as I keep moving forward, and keep my bonds as true and dear as I can. I can‚Äôt forget what‚Äôs important to me. Maybe I‚Äôve grown enough as a person now, on my own. So I won‚Äôt forget these places, these people, or myself.",31May2019,112

I got clean, moved away, and had kids. All extremely normal circumstances that seem very standard. So where does all this luck come into play? 21 years old by far the worst years of my life. Lost everything my 21st year of life. Lost my gf of 3 years lost my home. My parents got a divorce after 25 years also I went to  6 rehabs that year. I got my car stolen along with 185 bitcoin on a computer. All sounds extremely unlucky...  but the luck is I made it out alive! Out of all my friends that I used with almost none are alive. I moved to a very wealthy area of California after rehab. I met a beautiful girl whos family happened to be extremely rich! She fell in love with me and her family loves me. I dont have a good job and I never went to college but they all still like me. My wife's sisters date very high profile people ie. Models and millionaires. So for me to even have a chance with this family is ludicrous. But somehow the whole family loves me and accepts me for the piece if shit I am. (Like I literally stick out so much). This is just one example of many. I get good jobs without trying to much and now I dont have to worry about money ever. I dont even have to work and I know my family will always be taken  care of. Just extremely lucky. My luck has been my whole life. My wife says it's my personality but that's very far fetched to me. I wonder if their are others who feel the same way.

So I just graduated high school about a month ago. In high school, I had a group of friend. I feel like even though I have them, I am probably the one people don‚Äôt really like but also don‚Äôt have the heart/don‚Äôt care enough to tell me. But hey, tbh I am grateful to still have them. 

Two weeks before graduation was my birthday. My friends asked me to treat them to a restaurant (as they do every year on my birthday) and I was like okay, sure. But then my mom asked me accompany her to a relative birthday in the day my friends and I were supposed to go out. My brother couldn‚Äôt go with my mom so I decided to go with her and apologized to my friends. Note that this was 2 days before the actual day we were supposed to hang out, so it was pretty sudden, I guess, but not that sudden. They started ignoring me afterwards. I let them because I thought they‚Äôll get over it in 1-2 days. But nope, even during graduation they didn‚Äôt acknowledge me. So yeah, I am pretty bummed about that. 


Since I have nothing to do now, I feel so lonely. Can‚Äôt exactly go out with them since they still left my text on read.

64,"Everything I‚Äôm saying rn is true. I‚Äôm sorry if it‚Äôs toooo long.

I‚Äôve been in love with three girls in my life.

I‚Äôve been in love with the first girl for more than a year. My love for her was also the reason of my depression, because I knew she was totally out of my league, which made me become more insecure and shy, and also lose confidence about my appearance. I didn‚Äôt even ask her out one time, because I was completely scared, even though we see each other everyday. To this day I don‚Äôt even know if she knows that I was in love with her.

Last year, I realized that I couldn‚Äôt keep being broken over a girl who I would have never had a future with, and then I also understood that I didn‚Äôt love her anymore. She will always be the first girl I loved, but I just don‚Äôt have feelings for her now.

After realizing that, I started to like a girl who I didn‚Äôt know so well, but had always been a great person to me, and this time I wanted to actually do something to get her, without being unnecessarily scared.
I began to text her in her DMs from time to time, mostly reacting about her stories and trying to make conversation. When I saw that she also texted me first sometimes, I couldn‚Äôt be happier. I legitimately thought she also liked me.
I knew I couldn‚Äôt ask her out casually, as it kinda felt like a big deal to me. So I built up my confidence and a basic friendship at the point that we were seeing each other almost everyday outside our school. I also had to become more attractive, so I started to work out and lost some weight.
Then, one day I was texting with her and I told her that maybe, sometimes, when she was out with her friends and I was hanging out with mine, we could meet and spend some time together. She was positive about it, but I knew she wasn‚Äôt enthusiastic.
So that day I went out with my friends and randomly asked her if she was still with hers. She was supposed to text me if she had gone out but she didn‚Äôt. She just told me she had gone home.
I started to understand that she wasn‚Äôt into me, so I had to take a last shot to know if it could have worked between us.
The night of 4/8/19 I told her how I felt, and she rejected me.
We agreed on remaining friends, and act like nothing had happened, but then we ran into each other at school multiple times, and she avoided me. It made me realize she didn‚Äôt deserve my love, and I had to forget her.

Afterwards, I regained contact with a girl I had known since four years ago. I knew that that girl had had a crush on me when we were younger, and sometimes I thought I had feelings for her, but I was never able to understand if I was actually in love.
I had tried to reconnect with her before several times, but it looked like she had a boyfriend, so I didn‚Äôt want to make a move. It still hurt knowing that she wasn‚Äôt available, though.
We agreed to see each other after I tried to postpone our meeting, since I knew that going out with a girl right after being rejected by another girl would have made her only a backup girlfriend.
The night of April 21st, we met after a long time. I knew that a part of me was still thinking about the girl that had rejected me before, but I wanted to get her out of my mind.
We had a great time together, and decided to keep seeing each other. 
On April 26th, even if I was incredibly nervous, we kissed. It‚Äôs not easy to make a move on a girl after having two love stories before that had made you feel so broken.
I understood right after that kiss what I felt about that girl. Everything I had had to get over in the last two years was a build-up for that moment. Having a crush is good, but knowing that a person likes you back surely makes you understand the difference between a crush and being in love.

We have been together for over a month now, and I constantly feel like this is really what I want. I keep saying my girlfriend how much i love her and how she has brightened my life.

So I guess, what I‚Äôm trying to say is: do it. Do anything you want to do. Make a move, get rejected, feel broken, because if you just wait there and expect things to change they won‚Äôt, and you may end up wasting months of your life thinking about somebody just to gain perspective to understand that there is always, in fact, someone who loves you.

&amp;#x200B;

So my mother is insanely paranoid about intruders because her sister's house got broken into last year. We got a brand new alarm system, secured doors and a lot of tasers and peppersprays in the house just in case. My mother wants to have protection nearby at all times so she has one pepperspray in the garage, one in the kitchen, one in her bathroom, etc..  


One day my grandpa visited and wanted to take a dump. He went to our toilet and did what he had to do. Some minutes later he came back 'crying'. His eyes were insanely red and it looked like he was in pain. He went to the sink immediately and started washing his eyes. Later we found out that he wanted to use an air freshener to hide the smell of his shit. Instead of that, he accidentally took a pepperspray and sprayed it all over. He took collateral damage from the sprayed air in the tiny restroom.   


One day later  


My dad and I would go somewhere (I forgot where). Before we took off my dad needed to take a shit. He went to the restroom and came back later, nothing special.. When we were driving for about 5 minutes he started to complain that his ass hurt. I thought it was quite funny.. After some time it got so bad that we needed to head back home to wash his arsehole. Apparently, the toilet paper also took collateral damage from the pepperspray. My dad wiped his ass with it so it felt like it was burning.

So there's this one friend of mine. I (16,f)know her for two years now. It was always a great relationship but the shit started in September last year. I should mention that she has another very good friend, I think she likes her better than me. 

Anyway, so here's the issue: someday, she started to call me ""trash"". I didn't do anything to her, she just did it with her other friend who finds this funny. She keeps calling me names, criticises everything I do, I wear or I say. And thinks it's funny. She really thinks bullying me all day is funny. I can't do anything right. She talks bad about my brother and my dad, jokes about them with her best friend and says other very hurting stuff. As an apology she says ""it's not meant that way"" and I shouldn't be so sensitive. 
I also got a crush on a boy which I try to forget but she doesn't let me to. She keeps asking me about him, knowing that it hurts me so much, calls him ugly everytime he walks by. 

She knows that I have depression issues. She tells me that I am crazy, not normal because I really have trouble getting over this boy and often cry. She says that I annoy her when I talk about my feelings. 

This is a toxic friendship and I really don't know how to get out there. I don't really have friends apart from her and I'm afraid of being alone. 
But I can't go on like this, it's eating me up inside. 

Thanks for reading.",31May2019,2
85,"Trying to figure out what the proper term is so I can research it and seek treatment if necessary.

I was never touched, basically the grandfather of an old family friend would pull me aside when i was a child. He would separate me from the other children and lead me into a room and close the door. I must not have been older then ten years old. We would sit on the bed together and he would make me kiss him on the mouth and cheeks. Afterwards he'd say thank you  and give me a quarter. lmao, young me felt ... is this my worth? only a quarter?

&amp;#x200B;

i remember feeling uncomfortable every time we would go visit these friends and try to avoid it even though I was genuinely friends with the daughters. I was on edge the whole time. If the grandfather was there,  I would try to hide. He was creepy towards me too in other ways, make me play checkers with him alone while all the other kids were playing outside. I just wanted to play with the other kids and be normal.

This means that Japanese, German, and some other languages would be useful, but my 3 classes have to all be the same language.

98,"Hey everyone. I'm in a shitty spot. Lets cut to the chase. I know most people won't care, that's fine. I'll start with this. My situation isn't neccessarily my fault per say. I had been living with my father since i was literally born but besides that, my dad got really sick years back. And was hospitalized. After that pretty much everything went to hell. My mom passed away 3 years ago and since then we've been struggling with bills and mortgage and the whole 9. Basically my father got evicted and unfortunately for us my boyfriend who was living there with us aswell and I now have nothing. And nowhere to go. My father went to live with his mother and is gonna move in with some random lady he knew from 30 years ago shortly after. He has everything figured out. My brother who also lived there has been trying his hardest to do whatever he can to help my boyfriend &amp; i. But he moved out on his own aswell. The shittier part is that i've brought my cat into this situation and she's homeless with us also. We're currently staying in a hotel only until Sunday June 2nd. We spent almost all of our money just to stay here for a week and no we REALLY have nothing. I had a job but with looking for a place to stay and calling all these places i had to quit. I have no other option. Due to the moving process and everything i was already forced by my family to call out of work to help move THEIR shit out of the house. And then i had 1 day to get all my shit out of the house and forgot about half of it because we had to rush. I'm in central new jersey rn. I was just wondering if anyone has advice for me or any numbers to call or literally anything?? It sucks too because i have no friends, they've all used me in the past and now that i have nothing they don't want to help me, of course. Any info anyone has i'll accept. And don't say ""get a job"" because you clearly don't know how to read. I had a job and i can easily get one, that's not the issue. I need a place to get stable in order to KEEP said job. Thank you to everyone who understands and anyone who can be of good use. Sorry this is super long i just had to get it all off my chest and make sure every detail is known before you judge me.

99,"After recently finishing in a relationship, I am having to re-home my pup. She's 2yo and we have had her since she was 10 weeks. I'm the one that has really built a relationship with the dog and walked her, cared for her etx

Because of the hours I work I can't keep her on my own. She would be alone for too long each day and she deserves better than that. My ex is in a similar situation and will be moving back with parents so can't take her either.

My ex has found someone who will take her on a permanent basis. They are kind, mature people and will have plenty of time for her. She will be better with them than couped up alone all day with me, but it is breaking my heart thinking about not having her anymore. I've spent more time with this dog than any other living being over the past 2 years so her not being there to greet me in a morning and when I get home from work kills me, but she deserves a life of love and affection and long walks and company.

I work with young children, usually 3-4 years old. I have a child in my group who I firmly believe has ASD or Autism spectrum disorder. He doesnt talk, he babbles like a baby and he hasnt ever played with any of the other kids. He sits alone and plays quietly or watches other kids, mimicking them.

Today he spoke the first word I have ever  heard him say and he said it while playing with another child. 

He started playing blocks with her all by himself, I was watching them play for a bit when another kid went and stole a block from him, he looked at him and pointed and said ""No!""

I have been trying for so long to get him to do anything but coo like a baby and I thought it wasnt possible. I talk to him constantly to try and entice him to talk. I almost felt like giving up because nothing seemed to work but this has given me so much hope.

I want so badly for him to speak. I want him to have the best chance of making it that he can. I really hope he can get an IEP when he heads into kindergarten so he starts with the help he needs.

I had a book report, as the title obviously states, and god damn do I want to go back. See, I was reading a good book\~, and the teacher said since I was reading it, I really couldn't do a report on it. Seeing as not a lot of action had come into effect yet, I was fine with this. Alas, about a month later, I got to the spicy part. By then, I'd already have started my book report. ""This is fine."" I told myself, hoping this would be the book's climax. Holy HELL was I wrong. The book I was reading may have looked like a weird book, but DAMN could I do a book report on it. See, the book I was reading... may not have been the best choice, but compared to my original book\~, the book I read (even though it was about a very bloody time in history)\~ was measly compared to the other book I read (if you think about it on a wider scale)\~. Now, by the time I realized that would be a good book report, it was past the due date, I'd turned mine in, and was waiting to present. Now, I didn't do too good (in my opinion)\~. For now, I was fucking screaming at myself. ""WHY DIDN'T YOU BRING IT UP AGAIN!?"" and ""FUCKING REDO IT"" came to me fast. Then, I presented, I didn't do too well, because, y'know, I was nervous. So, now I fucking hate myself. I'm fucking begging for a sequel, I've been jamming my brain on what happens next, and I want to share my book in the form of a book report, something you SHARE BOOKS FOR!

There's a lot of downs to college of course (and normal downs from school, relationships, etc...) but still, I feel overall grateful. But I don't feel like I should be happy for me, if that makes sense? I'm so stressed with school (particularly one class) that I don't eat much anymore. Everyone is in the same boat pretty much so when I need to find motivation to continue, I want to help others. Unfortunately I'm not doing great myself, I made a 24 page study guide and for some reason it didn't benefit me as much as others (everyone who I helped did better). I understand concepts well so I can help others with projects but it's hard for me to find motivation to help myself. I just... don't feel worth it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I realized I oversacrifice a lot for others even when it takes a toll on me. Luckily I have such a good group of friends that no one has taken advantage of it, and they often help me in return (not that I expect them too). I haven't seen my parents much because my Dad is so intuitive he knows when I'm suffering, and I don't want him to worry. I just become reclusive and don't want to talk when I visit, which makes them worry. I don't know, I try reaching out to others during times when I want to better myself, because I truly want to be happy. I just don't know if I deserve to be happy.

I don't know if I'm truly happy anymore, I used to do hobbies for me (piano, games) but I don't feel worth investing time into those, I don't feel up to it more often than not cause of stress. I wouldn't hurt myself because I don't want to put anyone through that or make anyone pay for a funeral, because I know I'm loved.

I am line cook at two restaurants and I work behind the desk at a music store and I give music lessons at the store too. Music is my passion in life. I love listening and playing music. I play guitar bass piano. I can also sing a little bit. But working in the kitchen is taking a toll on me I think. I have no idea what‚Äôs happening with me. I used to work close to 50 hours a week and would play gigs with the two bands I‚Äôm in and have to time to practice and feel fine. It didn‚Äôt bug me. But in one of restaurants I work in  the ‚Äúhead chef‚Äù whatever you would want to call her. Is totally mad. And I think when I upgraded to the line. Specifically at that kitchen I started developing a really strong hate for it. I think I was getting really bad anxiety attacks working during the rush there. But right now I‚Äôve cut some hours and picked up that teaching job and I just have no energy for anything right now. My friends ask me to hang out and I want to say no. But seeing them hang out with me gets me really sad and angry. Because I feel like they will get used to hanging out with out me and they will like it better that way.

I have 5 siblings. That‚Äôs right I am from a family of 6 kids 5 older than me and 1 younger. 
My father was a very stern man. He was the structure in the house. And the bread winner. My mother was the sweetest and nicest lady you could ever meet. And that‚Äôs where I get my kindness from I think. She‚Äôs the reason for my moral compass. But anyway. Growing up with 5 siblings was madness. But when I was 6 years old. I was sleeping in my dads bed when he had a fatal heart attack and died in his sleep. My mom found discovered him when she realized  he hadn‚Äôt left for work. I remember that moment of being tumbled out of the bed and going out into the hallway and seeing all my siblings crying and I had no idea what was going on. I remember the moment my mom told me that he was gone. I have a few fond memories of him but it gets me very upset thinking about it sometimes. I really wish he was here. As you can imagine. Raising 6 kids on your own took a huge toll on my mom. She ended up getting a really bad gambling addiction and would spend the weekend pretty much living at the casino. This part of my life I had no one. No one was raising me. My house was total chaos. I could do whatever I wanted. There was no consequence for anything I did. Eventually my mom had a full on mental breakdown and was hospitalized for a month or so. Maybe shorter maybe longer I don‚Äôt know but it felt like forever. Thinking about it now I didn‚Äôt really have a close bond with any siblings which kind of upsets me...  they are starting to have kids now and I feel like I don‚Äôt even know my nieces or nephews... It makes me feel awful.. but anyway I did horrible in school. Like my behavior was awful in the beginning. But then in middle school I started clamming up. Then in high school I was full on shy kid. I hated being called on I hated talking in front of the class.. I loved performing though. I played in all the ensembles and actually got into the district chorus and jazz band. Which is like a collection of the best players in the surrounding towns and such.  But by the time high school was ending I had no plan. I thought I‚Äôd take a gap year or something. But still I have no idea what I should do. I am interested in truck driving at the moment and I think I‚Äôd like to look to get into that. But I don‚Äôt want to be throwing away any musical opportunities for the future. And I‚Äôm working at these restaurants slowly rising up through the ranks. But I have no idea what I want to do... I just keep saying yes to things whether  I want to do it or not...
