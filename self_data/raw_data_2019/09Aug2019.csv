1,"I’m always nervous and it makes me so stupid shit.

My coworker was showing me around the store since its my 3rd day on the job. At one point when we were turning to exit a department, my hair moved forward towards my face. From the corner of my eye, my hair looked like I was about to run into a pillar as I was walking. It’s hard to explain, it all happened so fast. Basically my brain registered I was about to run into something so I did this huge flench. She did a nervous laugh and looked concerned lmao.

It’s one thing to make a mistake but I’m all around a nervous person and I know people can pick up on that. So being nervous and randomly flenching at nothing probably makes me look like a weirdo.",09Aug2019,4
2,"I hadn't made any plans with anyone, and I know its short notice, but getting rejected by several people really made me feel unwanted. I don't socialise with people that often but I do have a group of friends or two. I'm on an anti-anxiety medication (phenibut) and I was feeling social. I asked around five people individually and a groupchat. All I got was some excuses and ghosting. I don't know what's wrong with me. I know i'm a bit unattractive and my voice is a bit strange, but I consider myself pretty friendly, compassionate, and lighthearted. It discourages me from asking again. It makes me question who my real friends are, if I have any. I spent the day feeling sorry for myself and watching birds around campus.

Thanks for reading, I just wanted to express my feelings to someone.",09Aug2019,1
3,"Okay so this isn't such a big deal in the grand scheme of things but it's good for me. I have quite bad acne and I NEVER go out in public without makeup on because I'm too self conscious as I used to be bullied about my skin. Tonight I have an overnight flight and I didnt want to sleep with makeup on because my skin is especially bad at the moment and it had started to come off anyway. So, I've taken off my makeup. In the airport. I feel super self conscious and like everyone is staring at my acne but my skin doesn't hurt as much now. It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. I'm proud of myself, even though this is only something small.",09Aug2019,8
6,"I'm 23 y/o black guy from the suburbs. Most people would probably consider me whitewashed or whatever. I've dated a good amount of women in the past, most of whom I'd consider way out of my league. But I've only seriously dated/was pursed by two black women my whole life. Both of which were great people, intelligent, and attractive. However I can't shake the feeling that sometimes I'm getting looked over. I'm not one of those guys that hates on black women or has an identity crisis. Honestly, I prefer them over other races, just at a beauty standpoint. Not a fetish thing, just a slight preference. I used to chalk it up to mainly being around white people. Coworkers, friends, acquaintances, all majority white. Wasn't on purpose, just had similar interests/hobbies. I know a decent looking guy, I have intresting hobbies, I have my shit together, have goals and aspirations, but I dunno. I met someone on Hinge and went on a date. She was great, but didn't feel any chemistry at all. Felt like we we're in two completely different worlds. Met a few other women on Hinge, Tinder, POF. Same thing, never really went anywhere, and I treat all women the same no matter who they are. But had no trouble meeting non-black women at all. The chemistry was usually there, similar hobbies, similar humor, etc etc. The crazy thing about it, is that other black guys I've met have similar experiences. Same with black women when I comes to us guys. Maybe I'm overthinking it. But I'd really like to meet more black women I have good chemistry with.",09Aug2019,1
8,"Life has been a very harsh to me ever since I've been small.. years of bullying scarred me for life to where I've got so many insecurities and self-esteem issues at my age (29). I'm normally a very strong man mentally and I have been all these years but I feel like today..today I've lost that war with myself. 

 A little background. I'm originally from California and life was great.. I had a well paying job and I loved it. My sister was diagnosed with cancer in 2015 and she reached out to our family for help. I, being the only one with no kids or anything, decided to move to the other end of the country to help her. 

Fast forward to today and she's recovered thankfully. Now, I'm the one that's not well off. As prosperous as I was in California, here... It seems that I just can not jump ahead. I can't succeed in anything.  Every job I've had here I've ended up leaving for one reason or another. I became overwhelmingly depressed because of continuous problems with my sister and my now ex girlfriend. I came here with an open heart, willing to help but now... When I need it most... That same willingness isn't being returned to me. 

I recently was Injured at work. My lumbar spine disc (L5) has been damaged and I am in need of physical therapy, which I go to 3 times a week. I'm only allowed 20 hours a week max at work which roughly gets me about 330 dollars bi-weekly. To say the least... The dollar store is my grocery store. Due to problems that had nothing to do with me and happened before I arrived... We have been without electricity for almost 2 weeks. I've slept in my car and in this heat.. it's almost impossible, so sleep deprivation is active right now. Sometimes, I also go without eating because I just can not afford it. Why don't I go seek assistance like EBT and other things you may ask? My sister gets all that so if I were to go under the same household, she would lose it all. Seeing as she has a 7 yr old daughter..  I'm not going to allow that. 

Yeah yeah, even when I'm being treated this way I still look out for my family. Right now.. I'm being cornered into a dark hole... I need help but don't know how to go about getting it.. I need to feel like I matter.. the only thing that keeps me afloat is my passion for music and singing. Even people at my local church have hurt me.. and personally it was the place I least expected it. 

All in all... I've never hit rock bottom but I'm sure I'm very very close if not already there. What should I do? I feel like everything I do fails here.  I'm a failure as a man... And as a human being. I've nothing to lose.. why should I keep enduring this? No one cares..even I don't anymore.. no one hears my desperate cries for help.. maybe because of my age? Or maybe because I've always been the rock everyone leans on.. but who is going to be my rock when I need it most? No one it seems for now...",09Aug2019,1
9,"I'm constantly pulled between working hard for a good college and good grades, and screwing around because I'm a teenager (16 y/o)  and there's no better time of life to.  I want to study and work hard and develop a strong work ethic, but at the same time I want to party and be crazy and spontaneous. I'm just not quite sure how to balance the two.",09Aug2019,1
10,"I'm sitting at a comedy club and about to see a Latina comedian perform. Sadly, I was just texted by an old childhood friend that some of her family was in that terrible shooting in El Paso, Texas. I immediately started looking for the exits and looking at people's faces to see if they looked suspicious. I absolutely hate that I just did this. 

I'm Latina and was born and raised in El Paso. I moved a few years ago to a different city that I have grown to love. But, being so far away from my family during this terrible time has been hard. I am very thankful no one in my family was hurt, but my hometown is hurting and it breaks my heart. 

I'm writing this to calm myself before the show starts.

I want to stop staring at the lonely white guy near the front because I don't want someone looking at me and thinking I might be a terrible person.

I really fucking hate this.

My heart hurts.",09Aug2019,3
11,"It was a horrible mistake. I went to a meeting, and my children didn't know my old 16 year old dog was outside doing his business. I don't know if he didn't scratch at the door like he normally does while they ate lunch and did chores right across from the back door. I don't know if they didn't hear him because they were being loud kids. I talked to them on the phone from the car, I texted them twice.. they were doing their chores, being so good, trying to please me so hard. They are so great sometimss. But something awful happened. Right before I returned from my meeting they had found him collapsed outside, in heat stroke. We couldn't get him to respond to much, his temperature was 108. My ex wife is a vet tech. We rushed the dog to their mom's clinic and they were able to bring his temp back down to normal. Unfortunately the stroke had already done it's damage. His old man brain was gone. He wasn't in there anymore. There were indicators of brain and tissue damage. We had to put him to sleep. My poor daughter keeps saying it's her fault and crying and I'm crying and I don't know what to say to her except that it was an accident but it doesn't make any difference to her. She was there for his final moments, she loved him so much and for this to happen is hurting double. I wish I hadn't had that meeting. I wish the kids had heard him.  I wish I had texted them to check in on old man. He has been part of our family for 16 years and I miss him so much already. His bed is right here next to mine. He was a good boy. He never bit anyone in his entire life.

Tldr; Died of heat stroke, teens inside didn't know dog was outside in the heat, they were home doing chores but didn't hear him.",09Aug2019,5

14,"So this is my first time posting on this subreddit, but i needed to get this off my chest and maybe get some advice.

I am 21 and this may I got dropped from my university program for a low GPA. The biggest reason for that was because I was in a program that I did not want to be in, I wasn't really enjoying it, so I went to classes but wasn't really trying and stuff.

I can look back now and realize how stupid I was though. I didn't really look for help and stuff at the time. When I finally was going to start taking university seriously, this summer, I planned to start using the facilities like office hours for professors, counselors and other stuff like that. I git the notice telling me I was being dropped from my program. The summer classes I was taking I also got dropped from.

For almost the entire month of May I didn't know what to do. I was lucky that a friend I had made a semester prior was willing to help and encourage me out of the depression I had gone into, and help me plan for the future.

I now have a job; I have been accepted into a community college to improve my grades; and I have a far better idea of what I want to do in my future.

The final hurdle are my parents - they're pakistani. I don't know how to tell them all this and I almost don't want too. When I had to go back for another year of high school to up my grades. My dad made it seem like it was the end of the world, he was pretty much crying and saying how I won't make much of my self and how he was going to die soon, he is in is late 60's.
He puts a lot of expectations on me and I always feel like I am just going and doing what he wants me to do. When I got droped from my program, i went to one of the the counselors and they told me to write about my self to figure out what I wanted to do. I was kind of horrified to find that I was having a hard time to figure out my own dreams and likes. I realized that around grade 11, I just started to do what my dad wanted me to do or what he approved of. I left my dreams and passions behind.

I have recently gotten back in to reading, and am now writing a short story as well. I have slowing started finding my passions, dreams and desires.

I am still uncertain how to tell all this to my parents though. I am afraid of there disapproval still.",09Aug2019,1
15,"He’s so nice and sweet and cute and funny and...I could go on. I miss him rn. Idk if we can actually date bc of some complications that I don’t wanna explicitly state for anonymity’s sake. And I’m a little sad about that, but right now I’m just focusing on spending time with him when I can. I was convinced that I’d never feel this way about anyone after my ex but boy was I wrong &lt;3",09Aug2019,2
16,"If someone siad can you make anyone in the world fall in hate with you? I'll say yes. I'm confident I can do that. I can do something different in every case that can make any person hate me. But if they say can make someone fall in love with you? Even if I had billion dollars and even if I look like supermodel athlete and even if I can tell the funniest jokes, I can not say I will be successful 100% of the time. I wouldn't know how to prove this to you but it feels plain and obvious. I can instinctively dissociate and see what I might do and for sure I can make every single person no matter who it is, fall in hate with me. But not fall in love, even if the fate of the world depended on me.

This is not a thought that's bothering. It's something I wouldn't know who to talk to, so I'm saying it to you.

I always wondered whether there are people who are as deathly confident as I am about being hated, and as eternally uncertain as I am about being loved.

Do you feel this way also? I want to know.

17,"I’ve moved out of home with a previous ex girlfriend at 18, but I was in love with her and just being with her felt like home. 

I moved out of my parents about a month ago into my own apartment. I’m not sure if it’s the loneliness, but I miss my parents terribly and it still doesn’t feel like home when I come back to my own place. 

Does the feeling eventually wear off?",09Aug2019,1

I have many, but one of my sexual fantasies concerns older women. I am a 22 year old guy, and I'm actually not really interested in ""older"" women (over 38) unless one looks younger, with one exception based on one or two past experiences of mine. If the woman is strictly lesbian (or I guess if that's what she makes me believe, at least), and is somewhat attractive. I don't know, basically I just have this scenario where a woman like that is very interested in my intellect and personality, and just starts developing romantic and sexual feelings for me. Also, the thing is that I'm not really interested in strictly lesbian girls at all really (even if one somehow started coming on to me), because I have certain perceptions about them.",09Aug2019,0

22,"The past year has been a struggle to say the least. I am a M(21) and went  through the roughest period of my life. I am telling this story because I am looking for encouragement but, also to encourage others. 

I am a senior in college and just got a 4.0 last semester. I am telling you this because last year things were much different. I fell into a dark place and started to frequently consume cannabis, Xanax and alcohol. Not only was I abusing drugs but, I started selling marijuana. I was selling pounds of it and transporting it from Colorado. 

This all changed when I was pulled over on September 17, 2018. I was brought into jail and charged with delivery of a controlled substances and driving under the influence of a intoxicating substance. I thought my life was over. I considered killing my self and almost went through with it. I lost my girlfriend at the time and hit my rock bottom.

I was given a chance to be accepted into a program that would clear my felony charges. Soon after that I became sober and started to regain my clarity.

I thought my life was getting better and happiness was around the corner. Then one day I came home from my final and saw ambulances police and my family mourning. My brother had passed away from a drug overdose in our basement. That all to familiar feeling of the world was ending rushed over me.

I am now nine months sober and just got a 4.0 this semester. I have stopped consuming nicotine and am working on self growth everyday. I am striving for success and a second chance In my life. I know it’s possible.

If anyone has any advice or encouragement it would be great fully appreciated. I hope this story brings hope to someone else struggling out there.",09Aug2019,2

26,"(Sorry if grammar is sloppy, I'm in the middle of a mental breakdown) I'm a teenager, I've struggled with depression for a few years now and it's gotten progressively worse, I've also self harmed before during episodes, but I've mainly got it under control. I've seriously contemplated suicide before, and have written a suicide note before, and even going as far as to list all of my possible options, and I've attempted to slit my wrists before but I survived. I have two wonderful dogs that are nearing old age but are still quite energetic and I love them to death. They've been part of my family for over 5 years now, and I now feel like they are my only lifeline. In January 2019 I attempted to kill myself by slitting my wrists, I passed out from blood loss and regained conciousness a few hours later with both of my dogs next to me, my parents still had not came home. They looked genuinely concerned, almost human-like emotions, and I realized how much they cling to me. I couldn't do that to them, I'm their best friend, like a father to them, and I was selfish enough to try to take myself from them, I didn't consider parents, I can't imagine them being too broken over it, and then I realized, there is one more person in my life who cares about me. I've been dating my girlfriend for over 8 months now and she's supported my mental problems the whole way, and I realize now how devastated she would be if I took my life. I just can't do it to any of them, my dogs would be so lost without me, and my girlfriend would never get over it, she's an emotional person and would probably place the blame on herself in some way. I tried further and further to convince myself that they were worth staying alive for, if not for me, for them. And I pictured my dogs, sitting, concerned, next to my body, nudging me, trying to wake me, and I just can't bear it. Aside from them, I doubt there is much preventing me, I have few friends, my parents would move on quickly, and there's really no-one else in my life who would care.",09Aug2019,5
27,"Yeah, man, I actually fuckin do. I know you were joking, and I’m so fucking deadpan that you thought I was joking when I said “duh,” in response. The diagnosis shook me to my core almost three and a half years ago and it sounded so fucking unbelievably terrifying at the time. My dad made me think it was all in my head, like I had nothing to be sad about because he was great to me so when I heard the news I felt like I was broken. I knew I was depressed, but this was different. Is it really all in my fucking head, dad? Am I that much of a fraud, really? I learned/remembered all of how it happened to me. I went to group therapy. I’m on 6 different medications, none of which are anti-depressants. Almost six fucking years of trying new medications for a few months *every* fucking few months and nothing works because that’s not the problem, and that medication won’t fix what is. Years and a correct diagnosis  later and I’m narrowed down to six medications, all of which fuck with my body but all of which I need. Medications for the side effects from my medications. What would I even fucking be like without them? I have no idea and that’s a complicated feeling. Icy hot won’t work for my fibromyalgia. I have an unhealthy view of myself and my health issues and feel like I’m defective no matter how hard I try because of what happened to me throughout my childhood. A fucking highway robbery. I don’t like talking about it. I wish you hadn’t said that. I don’t like seeing people talk about BPD. I want it to fucking go away. It makes me feel so fucking small to read posts and see how “well-equipped” people are to deal with assholes because they’ve grown up with people with BPD. There’s nothin’ you can do about it, man, you’re right and it’s true but my god, it hurts so damn much. I try so hard. There are people out here with BPD who don’t want attention drawn to our disorder. There are those of us who try to get better, and to anyone with BPD out there who thinks they won’t fucking be interesting anymore if they get help, go fuck yourself, that’s a fucking bullshit excuse and you know it is.

i’m hopeless right now. i’ve been unemployed and had no luck to find a job for two months. i have no money. ive lost my friends and i’ve fallen out with my family. ive been depressed constantly since 2008, and now i’m 24 and i still just want everything to stop. i find happiness, and then i drown a few weeks later when the depression comes back. i have no healthcare are so i cant see a therapist or get medicine. i’m just fighting this going on 11 years and i’m losing my battle. 

no one ever told me that being in love won’t bring me to be happy. in ten years i should be married, living in a home with my family. i should be looking forward to that every day, so why is it that every time i pass a lake i want to drive into it? why do i have the urge to close my eyes when speeding on the highway? why do i look at bottles of pills and want to take them all..

38,"Moved to the US. Parents split up when I was really young. Lived with my mother. Different side of the country. 

Went to college and went nearly a quarter million into debt with my father as a co-signer. 

Mother’s mental illness slowly came to fruition, perpetuated by the amphetamines her doctor started prescribing, lost her business and ability to control her emotions and her grasp on reality while I was attending college. Bankrupt. 

Father ghosts me when it’s time to pay for my last semester of college. Drop out because I can’t get a loan by myself. Mother fails to pay phone bill. I pay $600 from my college money to keep it going. Can’t afford the next payment they want: $2400. Phone shut off. Can’t even be mad because I know she tried but couldn’t handle it (also with a 3 year old child with step father of 3.5 years). 

Promises she’ll make it right and I’ll always have a home with her.

June 1st tells me she’s going on vacation for 3 weeks in 2 weeks. 

June 7 tells me the end of the month their lease is up. I no longer have a home after. Doesn’t tell me her new address. 

Step father promises to pay my first month of rent when I get my own place. Never replies when I take him up on it.

June 30 I pack everything I can fit into my car, gf’s mom lets me store it in their basement in a different state. 

July 1st I find myself homeless, no college degree, nearly a quarter million in debt, terrible credit, and no job.

 Drive for ride share company to keep myself alive. Sleep in cheapest airbnb’s I can find - really bad neighborhoods. I get by. I can’t save anything because I don’t have anywhere to cook my own food and have to blow it on fast food and housing and gas to work. 

Alternator fails. $600 to fix. Borrow money from gf to fix it. Only thing on my mind is secretly contemplating how to secretly kill myself.

Future is bleak; constantly barely getting by.

2 weeks ago I decide enough is enough. Apply to 150 LinkedIn jobs in my field in one night. 

Few replies, few phone calls. Hard to get my foot in the door with only 3.5 years of college.

Depression. Feel like a failure. Contemplated offing myself every day. 

Desperation. Feeling of defeat.

I get a call. Phone Interview at a good company. Another interview with them. Another, and another, 5th phone interview. Get a personal call from one of the top people at the company. Tells me she relates to my story (only mentioned that my family couldn’t afford last semester, neglected all the sad shit). Tells me she’ll go to bat for me and take a risk because she believes in me. 

In shock. 

6th interview in person at the office. Offered the job on the spot. 

Accept. Disbelief. Shock. 

I start working on Wall st in 10 days. A REAL job. Good pay, good career path, benefits, 401k, paid sick and vacation days. 6 figures after training program. Quarter million salary after a few years of experience.

Feels like the storm has almost passed.

Writing my story from an airbnb. $3 in my checking account and a quarter tank of gas (more than enough). $300 insurance due by the end of tomorrow.

Don’t care. I just have to make it to my first paycheck.

46,"I'm in a good spot in life. I (M20) still live at home and don't pay for anything but my own objects, gas and food. I'm very fortunate and lucky. I have been working ever since I got out of high school and have been able to save most of it. 

My dream is to become a commercial pilot. I love flying, I love planes and everything about aviation. It's my only actual passion that I feel something towards. 

In the (retail) company I've been working at, I impressed the management quickly. For my age, I'm am exceptional employee and I know it. I quickly worked my way up to a position that I deserved, earned and loved. I gave it up, and more than half my paycheck with it.

Because my dream is to become a pilot, the sooner the better (health, seniority, ect). And retail isn't going to get me there. So here's where I'm at now: I'm going back to college to earn a degree involving aircraft tech. So not being trained to be a pilot. I'm doing it so that I'll have a degree in aviation, it's a relatively cheap degree, it'll land be a decent paying job that will help pay for my future pilot training, and it'll be a job to fall back on in case becoming a pilot doesn't work out. That's what I'm scared of. 

So, a pretty smart game plan, I think. But here's what keeps me up: 

I want to be a pilot. But I'm terrified of my eyesight. It's not great at all, but not bad enough that it prevents me from living life (watching TV, driving, operating machinery at work, ect). Why haven't I just had a class 1 medical yet? The reason I'm going into the degree I am is to one day be a pilot. It's my motivation. If I know I can never live my dream (class 1 med. Failure), that's gonna kill me. But of course, now I have the uncertainty, doubt and stress. 

If my degree doesn't work out, I don't know what I'll do. I'll be right back where I was out of high school. Part time job with no direction. I'm terrified of that. I won't be able to get my position back, and the company has already (understandably) put me on the back burner. 

On top of that, my first love ended our relationship about a year ago. I could only see the pros at first, but now I'm starting to see the cons. Everyday, it feels like we broke up yesterday, and it's amplifying itself more and more. I can't get the thoughts of her out of my head. I haven't spoken to her since she broke up with me almost a year ago. 

So it's 1am, I'm stressing about things I once had control over, still have control over, and have no control over. It's not terribly stressful or agitating, but it's more of a annoying processing that won't shut off.

As a friend, I’m pretty easygoing and chill.. when I catch feelings for a guy, I become so obsessive and crazy acting. I haven’t been able to just go with the flow and feel comfortable about it, as I’ve always fallen so hard so fast. I become completely irrational and so insecure. I just hate how i become when I’m interested in someone.

I’ve taken multiple dry spells throughout my adult life, but always fell back into bad habits and never really learned what I needed to. I just met a guy who changed my life. He was nice to me and I felt a good connection, but my toxic behaviors drove him away. Losing him was what showed me how important it was that I really change this time if I ever want to be in a healthy, adult relationship.

But I wonder if I will ever be healthy enough. I’m in therapy now, and I’m taking a dry spell. I’m focusing on bettering myself. I do well for myself professionally and academically and have a good support network.. but I just can’t see myself being stable and secure enough for a relationship.

I've been on different relationships since my first love, but they never felt quite like it did yesterday.
We met on tinder and I was surprised by how beautiful and smart she was. She's from a different country, but loves mine. She suggested we get pizza and I was even more surprised. It was a refreshing experience.

Along the night we couldn't stop talking and laughing, everything felt really natural and I kept thinking ""this woman is amazing!"". She got really shy when speaking my language and I found that so endearing. Eventually the night had to come to an end, like all good things in life. We said goodbye with a hug and I added her on social media.

I went home with a smile on my face, but it was rapidly overcome by the sudden realization that I would never see this person again, ever. It's sad, and I'm hurting a bit. But at least now I have a clearer idea of what I want to look for in a potential life partner.

53,"Hi everyone I think something is mentally wrong with me to start. Let me tell you what I believe is causing my depression. I have posted here before and here is what I said:

“I feel as if I wasted the best years of my life doing something so dumb I can't stand life anymore. Last summer my group of friends started hanging out with this group of girls and one of them was interested in dating me. I decided not to date her because I was to busy with my business and saw that she was dating a new guy every month and I didn't just want to be just another guy. (BTW she was dating a lot for emotional reasons and not sex)

When I was a kid I was very lonely and didn't have many friends. I was bullied for how I acted and how I looked. I was always pushed around in life and never had the confidence to do anything. When I got into high school I decided to take a stand to this bullshit and started building a business. I worked so hard to build my business and was so obsessed that when something wouldn't go right I would want to end my own life. Now at the end of my senior year my business makes about 60k a year in passive income and I will probably make 100k a year passively in the next couple of years. This would sound great to the old me and to many others but honestly I feel fucking stupid.

Since freshman year I dreamed that senior year would be amazing. I would have a beautiful girlfriend and I could take her to homecoming and prom and have the kind of relationship I would see in the movies. My dream was so big but I felt my hard work could make something like this come true. Well honestly it did and thats what the problem is. The girl that I decided to pass up over the summer started dating a guy that she continued dating all school year up until today. Throughout the school year I had to watch them have the kind of senior year I have always wanted. Now that high school is over I feel like a huge failure. I chased money when I had the perfect girl in front of me the whole time who didn't care about my money or looks and liked me for me. Something much better than anything I could have dreamed of. Sadly I had to watch this die in front of my eyes. I can't believe how stupid I am. I wake up every morning in utter regret for what I have done. Each day gets worse as I think about what could have been to the point where I don't want to live anymore.”

I realized that my depression doesn’t have much to do with her. It was the dream I had that I can now never fulfill. I can never take a girl I like to a dance with my friends and have a great time. I can’t go to those games with a girl I care about. In fact I can’t do anything now because it’s over. I feel as if I never had the time I wanted to in high school and I feel as if I failed. I can’t move on because I have this need to finish what I started and the fact that this dream is dead I feel as if I have died with it. It’s all that mattered to me and now I have nothing besides 4 years of regret. To anyone who comments I know this may sound pointless to you but this was the dream I created and the dream I spent countless hours trying to achieve. All my struggles and successes are in that dream. Hopefully you can understand that if you worked as hard as I did and when you reached the moment when all your hard work was about to pay off you missed your chance and all you had to do was just was just say tell someone you like them and the dream would have been complete. I understand that yes she could have broken my heart but at least I would have got some kind of reward but instead I leave empty handed. The money that I earned means nothing without the dream. My chance to have a high school relationship is over and I am just done. Maybe I am crazy for being so depressed and suicidal for not completing what I wanted but please give your honest opinion.

I've never been violent towards her, never thought it, never would. But emotionally I want advice.

After our initial honeymoon period, she flirted with other guys in front of me when we went drinking.  I would get cross and we'd argue and we'd say stupid things to each other.  It wasn't fun for either of us. But sober, everything was good.

I took 3 months CBT for low self esteem.  I can use the techniques. But somedays I still get a low mood and it gets the better of me (slumping, depressed, don't think I can do anything right).

She flirted with a guy on text and I found out. We made up, and after a few months we forgave each other.  I barely think about it.

We went out for a celebratory meal last night. Got home and had a couple more drinks.  Out of nowhere.  I accuse her of doing it again with a colleague.  I don't even think she is, and she definitely isn't.  Nevertheless, I accused her of it.

I managed to get him to fall asleep this morning at about 7:40 with lots of cuddles, he woke up a bit a few hours later, I sent him back to bed, and it's now 12:10 and he's asleep. I went shopping so he's actually got something to eat when he wakes up.

But I'm also tired. I'd been so excited to sleep exactly the way I like, closed window, closed door, closed curtains, and I get woken up at 7 because he couldn't sleep and had gone on a two hour journey back home so he could possibly find sleep here. We always sleep exactly the way he likes it, which is fine since he gets no sleep if there's even the smallest thing wrong (see: the last few weeks where he slept worse than I did despite everything being the way he usually likes), but I was just *so excited* to have a proper night's sleep myself. I'm quite disappointed my sleep was cut short instead. I'm the kind of person who can't fall asleep easily, and falling asleep again after talking to someone for like 40 minutes is especially hard.

69,"So I'm a 35m. 

When I was about 4 or 5, I was with my mum and she bumped into a female acquaintance of hers - she wasn't like a best friend or anything but she knew her reasonably well. 

I can't remember the specifics of what they were talking about, but either my mum mentioned my dad or the woman mentioned a partner/husband etc at some point in the conversation. I remember very clearly the woman saying though ""urgh men, I hate them - they should just ship them off to some island somewhere and leave us to it!"" I can also swear she looked my way with some sort of glare/state as she said it but I'm not 100%

It was never discussed by me and my mum and I don't think my mum said anything in reply to this woman, but it's made me realize lately that one comment has had such a negative impact on my life. 

I had a recurring nightmare in the immediate weeks after that moment - I remember it vividly. In it, I was on some massive wooden raft naked and I was with my dad and loads of other men. I remember being cold, scared and crying and I remember my dad looking all scared too but he put his arm around me and said ""it's ok"" and then the lights went out and the raft started sailing out somewhere in the sea. I remember other men crying too. 

In the long term though, it's made me so hostile towards any form of banter between men and women. If I hear any woman I know making ""men"" type comments, I'll get really defensive even if it's flippant and has nothing to do with me (I got into a really big argument with a female co-worker in a previous job when she was doing a bit of ""manbashing"") and I can't even get into discourse about the differences between men and women, I can't take any criticism of men when it comes to discussions about problems women face and I get very emotional really quickly and take anything personally. 

I wish people would be more careful about what they say around young kids, especially boys - one comment can screw someone up for life.

I’ve even gone so far as to not pay and bag my groceries first but the woman behind me began scanning her items on my tab.... and then got mad at me for it ... like seriously. I can’t deal with people like that.

72,"I (14f) have a small group of friends , I started hanging out with them at the start of 2018 because of a girl I had been friends with for a few years . But lately I feel like I've been left out . I'm not in their group chat , I am not invited to sleep overs etc . This is also my fault in a way , im afraid of being alone (having no friends) and being rejected . It scares me so much that I cant tell my friends about the way I feel or even make plans  to hang out over the summer .

How do I tell my friends about my feelings ? And overcome my fear of rejection?",09Aug2019,2

74,"I am 27 now. That means it (at least consciously) started by the age of 12. You can imagine I had a hell of a youth. Literally. It included being bullied for two years, being addicted to video games and pornography as coping mechanisms and distractions from myself, having overly challenging parents and being hospitalized four times at a total of ten months due to suicidal tendencies and multiple years of unemployment.

How? By acknowledging life itself through changing my perspective, especially by treating everyone as a teacher that you can learn something from. Both in real life and on the internet.

I defeated my depression by stopping to fight it and instead made it my friend. Why? Because like real people, the easiest way to be respected is to not demand respect but to give respect first to those that you wish to be respected by. So I respected my depression and befriended it and said it's okay for it to be there. You just want to protect me and I love you for that. And suddenly it was gone. No joke.

What most people define as happiness is actually excitement about stuff and experiences WITHIN life but happiness is not connected to stuff or experiences WITHIN life but it is ABOUT life. It's the sheer appreciation and gratitude for having the ability to experience this thing called life despite the struggles and despite the pain. My struggles and pain are not gone. But they don't influence my happiness. They are now teachers and not enemies anymore. By observing and analyzing them through mindfulness (e.g. all forms of meditation and very importantly self-reflection) they now tell me their secrets because as we are friends now they trust me. You can only fight what you understand and you can only hate what you don't understand. And often you realize the only enemy was yourself and that's a fight you can never win so you better become allies and learn from each other. I mean that.

Keep it simple. Humans tend to make things more complicated but in the end they feel the same way like they could already feel with having it done the simple way. I believe the reason for that behavior is simply fear. Everyone knows what needs to be done. Everyone. Literally everyone. But most people are too scared to embrace it so they try to find solutions that are not scary anymore. But it was never about the solutions. It was about them. The fear of the unknown. Befriend your fears and treat them like friends that try to protect you and then learn from them why they are there. It's not about oppressing your feelings but understanding them. Again, you can only hate what you don't understand because if you do understand you know to to fight it so why stress yourself about it? Humans like progress but they don't like change. If something kept them alive so far, why shouldn't that be the case in the future, too? That's how your subconscious mind works.

To break that cycle you need to realize where this path of resentment will lead you to. How? Just use common sense. Everyone has images in your mind how a disastrous lofe lools like. And how do we create these images? By watching other people's lifes and virtually portraying their situation onto our own lives. Watch what happens to people who gave up fighting: suicide, never-ending addiction, more depression, more anxiety. For what? For what? No one wants to die. They just believe they can't live anymore like that. No one wants to be addicted. They just believe there is no way out.

But also do the opposite: Imagine and visualize what would happen if you suddenly started living your life. How? Again, by watching others who turned their lives around. There is no magic. Humans mainly learn by imitation. That's just how it is. But habits can only be changed by repetition. Start as small as possible and then build momentum. That's the whole secret. So if you believe you are worthless, use the old trick of ""fake it till you make it"". It is that simple. There is no other formula. Your believes become your habits, your habits become your actions and your actions become your life. Therefore your thoughts LITERALLY (!!!!!!!) become your life. As the quote goes: Whether you believe you are a loser or a winner, you are right. Because when you believe you are a loser, you will behave like a loser and therefore most likely will lose which again will strengthen your belief of being a loser which again makes you lose more etc.  If you believe you are a winner, you will behave like a winner and the chance of actual success will raise because since you believe you are a winner you will never ever stop until you win. And that again will strengthen your believe of being a winner and that will motivate you to keep going.

Obviously there is neither a 100% success or failure guarantee. But what is the alternative? The alternative is living a life you don't want to live that makes even death look sweet. And that alternative as you might see now is no alternative. Imagine this: You'd be in pain forever until you die. Really imagine this. Get into the pain. No it won'tdestroy you. It will give you the fire underneath your butt that lighten ups your farts and turns you into a fucking rocket conquering space. Hopefully not literally, I don't think that's healthy. Do they sell cookies on Mars? Anyway, but this realization help me to help my fucks I was giving to fuck off. I just don't care anymore. I just live. It all starts in your mind. All of it! No exception! Everything valuable depends on perspective. So choose well.

Of course things like sports, nutrition, social life etc. are also vit things but you will implement them into life if you don't believe you actually need them. You cannot fill a heakthy diet with more video games. You cannot fuel a car with milk. It needs gasoline!

There are no SECRETS to live. They are all open for everyone to see. You just need to pay attention to it.

86,"Hi everyone, I’ll explain why I feel like this.
I’m a 23 y.o. mechanical engineer student, currently in my 4th semester. I have a lot of interest in arts and I love cars, bikes and vehicles in general. I chose this path in my life since I always thought that engineering is a “safe” way of earning money and my future seemed to be financially “easier”.
I’ve come to a point where learning/studying or better said putting new things in my head has become very difficult and I don’t really know why.
I am a pretty smart guy (although I know I’m not the smartest and that there are a lot of more people who are way much smarter than me) and I’m able to understand things kinda quickly but I really can’t focus on studying to remember them.
Since I have been encountering many problems with studying and concentrating in the last period, I have a lot of pressure because I don’t want to fail my exams since I’ve been studying engineering for two years now and failing would mean a waste of time.
Because of that I find myself wondering what would happen if I do fail or if I chose another path in my life and whether it would have been better, a lot of times, while studying and I only notice that after hours sometimes.
I also struggle to build self discipline and good studying habits.
I also feel a lot of pressure from my parents who would see me as a failure if I do fail, and since I still live with them for financial reasons, I am confronted with this pressure everyday. I feel like the way I’ve been raised causes me problems with self discipline and with taking responsibilities since my parents have always been very strict with me and they have kinda always been influencing me with every decision I’ve taken in my life till now. 
I always have this feeling that I can’t take decisions that would upset them. I come from an Albanian family and I’ve been trying to talk to them about this but it feels like I talk to a wall every time and they do not understand my struggles.
I don’t know if I was able to express my worries in the right way, I’m sorry if I could not do so, I have a lot of thoughts in my mind right now and I’m trying to make some order by typing this.
I’m sorry if my English isn’t that great haha

87,"This is going to be long

So basically I finished my final high scool exams last year in December. At first, things were going pretty smoothly. I facilitated at a youth camp  ( which was awesome ) and I had signed up for driving lessons.  On my SECOND driving lesson though, I messed up on hill starts and that's when my instructor pretty much lost faith in me and thus I inadvertedly delayed my test for six months. I searched tips online on how to improve my driving and I would like to think I did pretty good other than that one day but the damage had been done. I had to take excessive and repetitive driving clases for more than half a year ( In my country 90% of people take their test after 10 hours of class ). My instructor only booked my test one month before I leave for university in September. I didn't dare complain because my instructor is one of my relatives. I passed the driving test earlier this month super easily but I had to go to more ""driving lessons"" ( my grandfather basically makes me drive him around random roads beside me ) before being able to drive independently to wherever I want to go but the car is extremely old and pretty much ( sucks ). It has very poor power steering, extremely low power, a burnt out clutch,broken speed meter and poor suspension. My neighbourhood has a lot of these stupidly high bumps ( where if I don't go EXTREMELY SLOW, I smack the car's rear on the ground because of it's garbage suspension ) and drivers who high beam and honk me for driving 30 km/h in a fucking RESIDENTIAL area so it doesn't help. These past few days, I've never felt my confidence drop to such lows. My knees feel like snapping because of how much focus I have to put in to drive it and my dad refuses to let me drive anywhere and with the new cars because he assumes that because I took so long before taking the test, I am an accident waiting to happen ( He said this indirectly to me / to defend my instructor delaying my test, I said I sucked once so that my parents wouldn't start berating my instructor because he IS my relative and he's actually pretty cool other than delaying my test. I understand how much this sounds like Stockholm Syndrome :( ) My grandfather actually bought probation stickers early to stick on the car because he was dead set on me driving the old car so I feel like a real dick if I told  him I want to drive the other new cars because it would be really entitled behaviour to do so. Having a car to drive is a privilege but goddamn is it breaking me inside. I've been coming to an internal conclusion that I am a garbage driver and maybe I'm under the illusion that the cars are holding me back. The only thing preventing that thought from being 100% is that I drove a really nice car on my test and it was really smooth but I've read that old manual cars force you to learn how to drive better so yeah I think it's just me. I've been watching so many tutorials and tips on YouTube and I've been improving but I feel like I will never reach the point where I'll be a safe driver. I've been learning to reduce coasting and shift gears better  but I occasionally stall because I don't put enough gas, ( it really needs a lot of gas to push off, it needs to rev like a sports car) and I go too slow sometimes. This is only one of my problems these past few months but it is the biggest. 

My friends pretty much stopped inviting me to hang out because I rarely had any transportation. ( Due to the above and I never bother my family with it because from experience, whenever I make plans my family ends up arguing and it will end up with me being scolded indirectly just for wanting to go somewhere Ex: my dad/elder bro starts getting mad because it is far, etc. ) Ubers were an option but my dad would scold me for using them because it was expensive and he could send me thus my fam would  end up arguing and scolding me indirectly because I wanted to go somewhere as I said before. So basically I got a reputation as a hitchhiker and poor driver because I always had to ask them if anybody was passing my place to pick me up and my excuse for not driving a car was that my test was delayed. That ended up with me not being invited anywhere and losing a lot of friends. I never told any of them the truth on why I never had transportation because I try not to badmouth my family ( they're great but just not in this area). I basically had to walk several kilometres, use garbage busses ( my town has abysmal public transportation ) to wherever I wanted to go and pay high amounts of money for Ubers ( if it was TOO far even for me to walk ) without telling anyone because I didn't want anybody sympathising me or scolding me or whatever. I understand my friends' point of view in excluding me from hanging out because they think I'm just a cheapskate or lazy because I never told them what was up.

To be fair, all of my friends weren't the closest to me. I was extremely selective on who I could REALLY trust and that hurt me in the long run. I also didn't really ""connect""with many of my friends because my sense of humour, views, style etc. are all similar to my elder siblings who grew up in an era unrelatable to most of my friends. Since school ended, My friendships have been down in the dumps because of the reasons such as above. I had a girlfriend for two years but she dumped me last year ( due to reasons I would not like to share ) so I've essentially had nobody close to talk to for many months even before high school ended. I have a great immediate family but our weakness is not opening up to each other ( except my parents with each other ) so my siblings other than me  have a significant other or a close friend circle that is their cornerstone. Me being extremely selective and all have no access to any of this and there's no one to blame but me and I'm bearing the consequences. I've tried to have fun by myself but I just can't. Playing video games, sports and everything else is just depressing without anyone with me. I've been trying really hard to learn how to enjoy stuff alone but I just can't. I wouldn't consider myself anti-social. I'm that guy who you knew through some event, club or class we had and get along well but at the end of the day, is only a backup friend. The small handful of people I actually really connect with are now all busy with their own things now and have priorities bigger than me like their other closer friends, school etc. 

Finding a place to stay at the new city I'll be staying at is such a stress-inducer too. I'm under a scholarship that covers tuition fees and  not the rest so I've been looking for a place under a tight budget because I'm from a middle-class family and would not like to burden anyone as I'm pretty much leeching off my parents. (My scholarship has a part where it says I cannot do any part-time jobs) ( I want to clarify that my parents have told me that it will be no problem supporting me but I feel like such a leech if I live in even a tiny bit of luxury away from home.) My university also has no hostel. My results weren't good enough to secure a full scholarship so I will always hold that against myself until I somehow repay them.

Overall, I feel like I've wasted 8 free months of my life other than going downhill. These past few months have had some sweet moments but the bitter ones really overpower it. I'm an anxiety-filled, stressed wreck who looks pretty calm on the outside but is close to blowing up. Every day I wake up early with no drive and end up going back to sleep and messing up my sleep schedule. My confidence is down in the drain and it's not going to get easier from here. I plan to be a teacher but I don't think I can do it if I can't handle myself at this point in my life and I'm starting to have doubts.  There's so much more but this is all I can sum up right now.

112,"i have hobbies. i love them. i have a binder of my hobbies sitting right next to them. i dont want to open it, or even view the content inside it. I just really don’t care. I should, but I’m bad at hobbies. Not that I’m bad at doing the work, but I don’t CARE enough to actually put any motivation or effort towards them. Sometimes I feel like the only reason that I tried to take up a few hobbies were to appease people, thinking “oh the depression isn’t THAT terrible, at least she’s doing stuff”. But I don’t CARE!!! I just want to lay down all day but everyone gets mad if I do. I don’t know, I just don’t care and I wish everyone would just forget about me and my issues sometimes.",09Aug2019,3
113,"This post is gonna be a relatively quick writeup about my depression. If anybody could help me I would appreciate it and you may end up saving my life. I (M20) am gonna keep things vague, but if you have any questions please ask.

I developed severe social anxiety early on in high school. Most days I would literally not even say a word unless I was called on in class and then I would pretty much have a panic attack and embarrass the shit out of myself. This persisted through my entire time in high school and resulted in bad depression. 

Things started to get a little better socially when I was a freshman in college, but I would still not even say a word in class and drop classes that required any form of public speaking. I dropped out after that year while still living with depression and anxiety. 

The anxiety has caused my hairline to recede since I was 16 years old (4 years ago). I know that my depression is a result of my anxiety and my anxiety is caused by having zero self confidence, a piss poor self image, and caring what people think about me. Like I realize why I am feeling this way, but I still somehow manage to not feel any better. Multiple therapists and medications have done nothing. My depression is probably considered severe at this moment. A few months ago I got fucked up black out drunk alone and woke up with 30+ cuts on my right forearm. This has caused me to withdrawal even further from friends and family because I don't want them to see the scars. 

I feel trapped. My social anxiety and depression in high school feels like nothing compared with what I am battling right now. I think the two main hurdles I need to get over right now in order to be happy is my receding hairline and the scars on my arm which only time will fix. I would really like to buzz my hair really low, so I never have to carefully style my hair ever again, but I am scared of what people will think about me if I do it. I have never liked my hair EVER even before it was receding. I feel like if I do decide to buzz it I will feel even more self conscious about it thus making everything worse. I am in a very bad place mentally right now. 

I've heard that magic mushrooms can work wonders for treatment resistant depression and to give you an incite to life. I've read stories of where it changes people's lives. I've decided to grow them and they will take about 1-2 months to grow. I feel as if this is my last hope because I've literally tried everything. 

Welp, thats me. It feels good to have expressed my feelings like this. I could probably write a fucking novel on all the shit bothering me in life, but this is the jist of it. If you are still reading this then thank you for listening.",09Aug2019,1
114,"It's named Pi.

It's still in Beta, so you cannot convert it in real money yet, but soon you'll be able to.

The interesting point is that you just have to install the app Pi network on your phone, and click a button every 24h.

If you're interested, you need an invitation to join the network. Here is my code : Herbibi",09Aug2019,1
115,"I used to not gain weight, all of a sudden I've put on 20lbs over the last two months (no changes in eating or workout habits), my energy levels have plummeted, I'm losing even more hair on my head and growing even more hair where you don't want it (shoulders and back).

There's no reason to care about my appearance anymore beyond basic cleanliness I suppose.  I'm not and never will be in an income bracket where I can afford to even try to fight this.",09Aug2019,3
116,"This made her really offended and she yelled at me and asked me what is wrong with me for asking that. I was perplexed because I literally was just trying to guess, given that I don't know what in the world else it could be, is she right about being so offended by this? I'm just kind of lost. I was trying to be friendly",09Aug2019,12
117,"That's pretty much it, tbh. Doesn't change a thing, I was just proud of maintaining it and proving I can be consistent, kind of sucks that it's broken now",09Aug2019,3
118,"My parents sacrificed a lot to put me through school. They’re not rich by any means, but they paid for me to attend an elite (and very expensive) private school which later translated into me getting into a very prestigious university. I am and will forever be grateful for everything they’ve done and continue to do for all they have done and continue to do for me.

I have a sizable scholarship that helps pay for my tuition and some of my living expenses. I also work on the side. 

They’ve recently fallen on some hard times. My mom has been trying to guilt trip me into giving them some of my scholarship money to help pay for some expenses at home. I know they need it but if I do, it could put me in a really bad situation financially later on and I don’t see a way I could reasonably get out of it. The total amount of money I get is a lot but it all disappears into paying for tuition, room and board, books etc. I’ve tried time and again to explain to her that I almost never actually get to spend any of that money on myself but it goes in one ear and out the other for her. 

It’s also extremely difficult for me to resist pressure from someone who would probably donate her heart to me without a second thought if I ever needed it. The emotional toll of it is giving me endless anxiety and sleepless nights. I honestly don’t know what to do.",09Aug2019,1
119,"At first I loved it. Office work was easy- mindnumbing, but the time flew by. Then busy season came. I spent a week straight in the office, 12 hours a day. I wanted to kill myself. I was in physical pain from the long hours of sitting in a barstool chair (I have SI Joint Dysfunction)

My orthopedic doctor gave me two days of bedrest, and anti-inflammatory medication. Those two days run up tomorrow. I have eight more days of this. My job performance is terrible, and I’ll probably be fired. It doesn’t matter how hard I try, I still manage to fuck up. I’ve never been at a job longer than a few months, and I know that’ll keep me from getting jobs in the future.

I don’t know what to do.",09Aug2019,2
