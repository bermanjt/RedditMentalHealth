0,"My family had this home in a San Diego neighborhood since 2008. My Mom recently left my Dad after four years of tension, leaving my Dad and my somewhat unstable brother (now 20) devastated. While both sides are at fault, my mother said cruel and completely untrue things, and it seems her view of the past is entirely warped. After the divorce is finalized, the house, which is in a desirable neighborhood, will be sold.

My father flew me down and the three of us ate tons of italian food, cookies, watched South Park holiday episodes, and my brother made Christmas dinner. My Dad got our perspective and we reminded and assured him that he was and is a wonderful father, and received some really revealing things about his approaches to mental health.

I had grown distant from my father and brother. My brother is gay and has behavior issues, and my father can be described as a ""reluctant Trump supporter"" due to him being a lifelong Republican, which I'm a Democratic Socialist. However, I both gave them advice which they both accepted or considered, my brother to seek psychiatric treatment, and my dad to seek cognitive behavioral therapy, and come to the realization that while he still loves my Mom, she is unlikely to want to reconcile. My brother hugged me for the first time in years, and sent me a nice email.

This was a bittersweet Christmas and had to spend it away from my SO, but it needed to happen and I'm very glad I did so.",29Dec2019,1

I have a friend who's very dear to me, she's younger so I see her as some sort of baby figure. She's 16 and, overall, she is a great friends, very funny,  a great writer for her age. She likes to dance, and we met through a shared interest, which she's very invested in. 
But it's been a year since she's started to feel very suicidal. She's constantly having anxiety attacks and whenever she tweets about them, I text her privately and try to help her through it. She attempted suicide at least 3 times this year and I couldn't do much about it except worry and pray that she's ok.
Now her tweets about suicide have been increasing a lot, and everything becomes a self-esteem trigger for her, even when we try to help her. She's going to the gym, having psychological treatment (although she didn't went to a psychiatrist yet) and still her mental health has never been more self destructive. 
I know its been infinitely harder for her to go through this than it is for me to show support, but at this point I feel like it's only a matter of time till she's never online again and I'm gonna have to deal with the fact that my dearest friend ended her own life. It scares me, because I love her and I believe so much in her future but there's no way to make her believe my words.
Anyways I'm just venting this right here because I don't want her to think I gave up on her. I'm gonna keep trying to help her whenever she needs me, remember her of my love and of how she's important to me, but I know that when/if she makes her decision, it's gonna be it.",29Dec2019,1

18,"My 23rd birthday is coming up on the 7th of January and unfortunately, I can’t do anything on that day because I have school 8-5. I just know I’ll be exhausted, stressed out, and too tired to be with friends. My introverted self will have no intention of leaving my house. So Ive decided to treat myself to a little somethin’ somethin’. 

Treat myself with what you ask? Well despite being single as a pringle who’s ready to mingle, I don’t think I’d be able to find an available human in time that I’m comfortable with to feed the starving beast of my *cough cough* ya know... ladycat. 

It’s hard out here in the dating streets! I feel like I’m in the hunger games out here to get a man. To everyone else on the streets like I am, we got this y’all! Don’t give up, and don’t let nothin distract you from the grind time prime time of getting your man/woman. But also remember it’s okay to be on pause every now and then. Always remember to bless yourself through self care to help get you back in the game and remind you why you’re in it. Yeah love, stability, yada yada yada, but what about that pleasure though?

So Ive decided to look at some options to temporarily satisfy my needs until my knight in shining armor can come bless me with his loot box. Since I can’t get knight in time, I’m going to go for plan B. I grabbed my handy dandy laptop, opened my incognito tab, and went on amazon and bought myself a dildo. 

Supposedly my handy dandy dildy will arrive on the 8th. I don’t have prime so unfortunately no 2 day shipping and I’ll be damned if I was gonna pay for that shipping fee to get it by the 31st of December. My ladycat can afford to do a little more time. It’s already been months so it can definitely make it through a few more weeks of sexual famine.

Amazon said I’d maybe get it by the 3rd if I ordered it within the next 20 minutes lol so fingers crossed everyone! I’ll be observing and awaiting the mailman to come drop off my ladycat slayer. Self care is most certainly due in that department and I’m honestly super excited for it! So excited that I wanted to share it on reddit haha. Thanks for reading my monologue.",29Dec2019,1
19,"My grandma went into a diabetic coma and had a stroke a few years ago. She had a form of dementia as soon as she woke up. She doesn't recognize anyone except me when I visit her. She doesn't recognize her own husband or her adult kids because they haven't been around her much but she and I have always been closer than anyone else in our family. 

We used to live next to them and would see them nearly every day but have since moved states. My mom called her dad to see how they were doing and she talked to her mom on the phone. My mom started crying when she mentioned me to my grandma, who I guess said that ""charliesmac is gone. Charliesmac is dead"" and so my mom had me talk to her. 

I didn't know until after I talked to her that she thought I was dead, otherwise I would have said something more reassuring other than I love and miss her. 

I haven't really been able to process what happened to her and have been numb to a lot of things in the past few years and I'm sure later on I will cry about it because it's a reminder of my grandma's mental state and how close we used to be.",29Dec2019,1

24,"I had an internet friend as an early teenager who I was very close to. We met on a One Direction role play server (I KNOW) when I was 13 and she was 15. To make a long story short, we became really good and close friends even though we never met in person. We texted and talked on the phone a lot and had each other on every form of social media and were thick as thieves for a couple years. 

Then, in late 2014, she disappeared. Literally fell off the earth. I've never had contact with her again. None of our mutual friends heard from her. She never came back on Facebook or Twitter, never answered texts or calls. It's been five years, almost double the length of our actual friendship, but I still think of her sometimes. I still wonder what happened. She had a troubled home life and was shuffled back and forth between abusive parents on opposite sides of the country who were into some pretty heavy criminal activity (enough that she never went far into detail) and she had attempted suicide before so it's always been on my mind that something dark may have happened.

There are still a couple people on her Facebook friend's list who are still active, one of which was her boyfriend. I've been considering messaging one and saying I'm an old friend of hers trying to  connect with my internet buddies from years ago and was wondering how she is now...but I'm not sure how that would be received, especially if something bad did happen. But she still does pop into my mind from time to time and I'd love to more or less get closure, at least. I really hope that even if we never talk again, she's alive and well and thriving. She was one of the strongest people I've ever known to this day and I know she's kicking life's ass if she got past her demons.

26,"I am 17F and I’m dating a 14 year old transgender male who ill call L. I met them at a DND birthday party for one of my other friends. It was a small party of just me, L, my friend, and her family. I had an amazing time and L and I hit it off super quick. I fell for L immediately and I let myself absolutely adore them and fall head over heals for them cause I planned on never seeing them again, cause that’s usually how life works. L later told me that when he  first met me he thought to himself “wow she’s so pretty, I really like her”. Anyway we had an amazing time, and in DND we were 8 year olds who were married and in what we called a “mutually beneficial very affectionate relationship” we shared a seat and it was just a one day dream come true. Anyway later in life, school starts and I decide to join color guard, and who do I meet there but the one and only L. I’ve fallen for L and he doesn’t even know it and now we’re in color guard together. I’m head over heels in trouble. The season begins and I learn all the stuff and I just can’t get over L I love to watch him every chance I get cause all his movements are just so fluid it’s amazing. Now L is a super cuddly person and he attached to me pretty quick, and I loved every second of it. we would wrap up together in blankets and hold each other to keep warm at the football games we preformed at, and I wish I could just freeze time in those moments I loved every second of it but it stung part of my hart because I had no idea if this is real for him too. Eventually i couldn’t not know any longer so I text him and ask “hey, do you like me? cause your a super cuddly person and I can’t tell if your dropping hints or if that’s just your personality” and L responds “I’m sorry I’m a super cuddly person and it’s probably bothering you and I’ll stop” and I think to myself oh no this is exactly not what I want, so I say “no, please don’t stop because to be honest I really really like you and it doesn’t bother me at all” L says “so in that case would it be ok if I said I liked you too.” I say “that would absolutely make my day”. And L says “well in that case I like you too” and from there agreed to start dating. I was so excited I went absolutely apeshit and I texted all my friends and literally everyone I knew to tell them the good news. We cuddled more at the games and it was amazing. I’m the kind of person who needs to poor all of their love and affection onto someone, literally all I want is someone to hold, and L is the kind of person who needs to be held and it’s just perfect. I cannot express how much I adore L it’s crazy. I remember we were riding home from an away game and L fell asleep on my chest and I got to hold him the whole ride home and death stare anyone who dared make a noise that might wake my darling L. I swear every second with him is a blessing and I used to and still do everything I can just for a few more seconds with him. I haven’t seen him in over a week and I miss him soooo much but I get to see him tomorrow and I literally cannot wait. Nothing makes me happier than holding L in my arms I really wish I could just freeze time in those moments and hold him forever. I’m so happy!",29Dec2019,1

29,"So this started around the beginning of October, its my favorite month and i love getting into spooky season and watching creepy videos and top tens on YouTube. So one night im watching videos and randomly I thought about how scary it is to sleep with your door unlocked, because someone could break in or even some one in your family could come in and murder you.

The thought and imagery just stuck with me all night. Im a deep sleeper and the image of me asleep and some dark figure of a stranger coming into my room and watching me or killing me just wouldn't go away. So scince then every night I have to lock my door. After i do i feel so safe and secure.

What was really concerning was that a few nights ago I left my door open so that i could get heat from the heater because it was cold. And my mom had her door open and my uncle was sleeping on the couch in the living room so, I was like its ok someone is in the living room he can wake me up if anyone comes.

 So i fall asleep probably for about 2 hrs and I woke up at 1 am and am freaking out I just feel like someone is watching me and I know no one is. Because my moms bf and my uncle are watching tv in the living room, but for some reasin the thought of beung watched or killed in my sleep wont leave. I tried to call asleep but i couldn't do after about an hr I I got up and locked my door and was able to fall asleep.

So that was really eye opening for me as to how bad it is for me. I have never had a home invasion and have had a pretty safe life so im not sure where this paranoia came from but its bad. If anyone knows anything about this or any way to stop it please let me know.",29Dec2019,1

How do I tell you that I’d wait a million years to have all of you as long as I have some of you, maybe it’s selfish maybe I’m selfish maybe you think you’re saving me now by throwing me away when all you’re doing is destroying me. Maybe I’ll see you again, I hope I do maybe then I’ll be enough for you.  I wish I could make you see how I see you. I wish you could see the pain in my eyes without you, the hurt. I wish you could see how when I think I’ll never see your smile again my heart fades a little more how when I think about I can’t cuddle you anymore or hear your laugh my eyes become less blue and my world becomes more gray. I wish you could see the nail marks in my neck from the last time we had sex before you bent and kissed me with love on your lips and how I’ll never have that again. How I loved that you had to touch me to fall asleep, how when I moved or sighed you would grab for me to come back, how you would grab my hand and put it to your heart because that’s where it belonged.  Maybe you think to you I was just a distraction,  we always replace one thing with another don’t we? Alcohol for coffee, smoking with eating, me to your marriage. Maybe I was just filling your void, but I don’t believe that.
I believe you’re hurting as bad as me and I wish you could see how much you meant to me, how much I valued you, I wish you could see how much I needed you. Through everything I just wish you knew how much I loved you.",29Dec2019,1
42,"So me and my friend have known each other for well over three years and we've rarely had any huge arguments or gotten upset with each other. Only three and the first two we were able to get through and our bond became stronger because of them and our stubbornness to give up on each other. So last year July, I told her that I had a crush on her and she felt really bad about it but I consoled her that it was okay because I didn't expect anything to change or want them to, I wanted to be open with her about my feelings. Although she felt bad at first, I know that she was glad I told her further down the line which would lead to our first major hiccup in our friendship. 

The beginning of this year, I my mental health was absolute shit from an accident I had from the previous Thanksgiving where I crashed my car and no one seemed to give a damn besides her. Depressed and afraid of all my friends have given up on me and my family only consoling me by saying ""it could've been worse"" and brushing off the incident, I turned to my friend in a frantic mess of emotions and just let it all out, She told me after all that we've been through that she'd never leave me and I'm not the best with articulating what I'm thinking or finding the right words to say and asked her why would she stay with me and brought up that I'm of no value to her and its not like she has feelings for me. I know that that came off as I was only her friend and stuck around because I had a crush on her and she immediately picked up on it and got really angry and upset and I don't blame her. I genuinely care about her and want her to be happy and all I was to her was a burden and I didn't want to hold her back. After a couple of days of cooling down we eventually talked it over and made up. 

Fast forward to what I believe to be May. Around this time my family was preparing to move and I pretty much lost everyone I could call my friend besides her. She was emotionally overwhelmed with her issues too at the moment and I wanted to give her some space although I wanted to be there for her and support her but I didn't want to push her away. We haven't spoke much and I was trying to get into contact with her and she told me she couldn't handle any more stress. I backed off to give her her space but also kept in touch casual talk and throwing jokes around. Then later she brought up how she lost her credit card and since I wasn't able to help her look for it, I asked if she froze her card yet and she commented on how everyone she spoken to already asked that question in a sassy-joke tone. I on the other hand didn't receive it that way since for one, it was through a text and I can't tell a person's tone through text personally and two, we haven't spoken that often lately so I couldn't tell what mood she was in and three, I was also going through a lot of stress myself at the time. I told her that I felt that she was being very snappy with me lately and it was unfair to me since I honestly didn't know what was going on and how I had to deal with one of my dogs passing without any support or anyone to confide in. She then brought up how I shouldn't have taken her sass to heart and why didn't I tell her about him before and got really upset with me. I was extremely conflicted with just dropping a huge emotional bomb on her when she wasn't mentally prepared because she mentioned how she was emotionally overwhelmed and stressed out. Of course I was taking her feelings into consideration too because we both have had depressive episodes in past and I really didnt want to push her over the edge because she also care about my dog. I made a wrong choice in putting off on telling her because she's a lot stronger than that and deserved to know. We then went on and discussed how I should have been more open with her about it and I agree but we also talked about how she felt she is hurting me because she doesn't feel the same way towards me. I can definitely see how she would believe that and it's not an entire fallacy because although it it does suck to not have your feelings returned, I was perfectly happy with just being friends with her. She supports me and my dreams and cares about me and my well being and it really shows. What more could I ask for from a person? I want to do the same for her but I know that there will always be that belief that I will want more and I that's completely understandable which is why I haven't flirted or made any suggestive ideas of the sort. Eventually we both cooled down and kept messaging each other. 

Come July and I haven't heard from her in days and I personally was too afraid to message her yet again. Come the fourth and feel like shit yet again (surprise surprise) since my family decided to visit relatives we haven't seen in years and of course I had didn't have much to talk about with them but they didn't even put in the effort of trying to catch up and I ended up crying in my car for a bit and went home. On my way home my friend texts me after about two weeks of silence. And we caught up again and genuinely talked about our feelings. I told her again that I didn't want a relationship with her even though I still have those feelings towards her. 

Now comes October and we're really close to each other. We were hanging out nearly everyday and messaging each other constantly. Some time around my birthday I believe, I'm not entirely sure. Suddenly just out of nowhere it hit me that I have deeper feelings for her, feelings that I've never felt before, that are more than just a mere crush and I told her and I felt like absolute shit because I honestly didn't expect it and now it seems like I was lying for months on end. She told me it was okay to have those feelings and its okay to have feelings. 

Now comes November, our current predicament. We were in a call together and everything is going well and just out of nowhere she asked me how would I feel if she started dating someone. I was completely blindsided by the question and didn't react well to it at all and I'm honestly ashamed I didn't take the time to sort out my thoughts let alone be honest about how I truly felt with my feelings. The first thing that came out of my mouth was ""Well, I don't think that I'll be able to say I love you anymore"" We tell each other that we love each other pretty regularly and I forgot to mention that beforehand (sorry whoever is reading this) And she asked what did I mean by that and I went on to say that I wouldn't be comfortable saying it because what if the person they're dating notice it and it causes drama? She shot down that idea saying that if her friends can't express their affection towards her then the guy can go fuck himself. At this point I was full of adrenaline witha racing heart afraid that I'll lose her like I lost everyone else and was only saying stupid shit to make her happy and leave me behind and the likes instead of being true to what I felt and what I wanted. We were both crying our eyes out at this point and she was telling me how I deserve someone who feels the same way about me and tried to convince me that she was a piece of shit and I shouldn't have those feelings for her and I deserve someone who feels the same way about me and she's right and so does she but I disagree about her being a piece of shit because she cared and supported me when no one else would and it really tore her up that she was hurting me and told me that I deserved to be selfish. I really wanted her to be happy because its not often when she shows interest in other people so I pretended to be strong for her and held in my tears so she would feel confident in herself and her choice and not worry about me. Obviously that was the wrong thing to do because it wasn't truthful to my feelings and she wasn't falling for that bullshit and hung up on me. She was incredibly upset with me that I wasn't being honest with my feeling and allow myself to be vulnerable with her. 

Now currently I just feel like a horrible piece of shit and terribly sorry for what I've done and the guilt is just eating me alive. I made her feel like she's the only one that has real feelings in our relationship which pretty much made her lose all trust in me and nearly impossible to earn it back. We both deserve for me to be honest with my emotions because it makes the relationship so much better for all of those involved. 

We've talked a bit ever since then but I know that she's in pain still and something else is going on thats causing even more pain for her and I want to be there for her. I don't want to lose her. 

I don't know why I'm posting this here. Maybe just to get this off my chest or have a stranger slap some sense into me? I don't want to turn this into a pity party but any feedback is welcome.

49,"I (f19) hurt my bf (m25). I posted a pic of myself nude on a subreddit and immediately deleted it because I knew I just wanted validation and it was wrong, but left the messages that were sent to me from commentors in my inbox unread. It was my first time doing this and I simply wanted to feel like I was wanted, but ultimately felt disgusting and regretted it immediately. 
 
He goes through my phone without asking or telling me, and I've told him repeatedly to stop doing this because it makes me uncomfortable, and to just ask me upfront to look at it. I've told him he can go through everything but my reddit because it's my only place I feel I can have any privacy- he usually respected this and didn't. He has had constant trust issues despite me being faithful and flares up when I tell him a problem I'm having with the relationship to the point that he kicked me out in the middle of the night once for telling him I felt like he doesn't listen to me.

Well, 2 days before Christmas eve he tells me he is going out of town for Christmas, which was a shock to me. On Christmas eve I tried to express my disappointment through text but he told me to drop it because it was the holidays, even though I told him I felt as if I was constantly walking on eggshells with him and that I wasn't happy. He tells me hes heard everything and knows what I'm going to say, so I shut up.

I was alone on the night before Christmas, and felt as if I had no one to talk to about how I felt. I feel wanted when I post nudes, although I hadn't sent any person other than him nudes since we'd been together. That night I posted one to a sub, my face scribbled out and no indication that it was me. It was maybe up for 5 minutes before I deleted it and had the urge to self harm as punishment for what I'd done, and acted on them. I tried to forget what I did, and didn't tell my bf as I felt like I couldn't talk to him about what happened.

A few days pass, and he comes home on the 27th. We hang out for the day, nothing special and he didn't give me a gift despite me getting him presents. He asked me what I was doing on my phone at one point, and I simply say I'm on reddit, and refuse to tell him doing what as I have never discussed or shown anyone my reddit acc. It's my personal space and I told him previously that I would be extremely hurt if he went through it. (I was just looking at r/niceguys) I could tell by the way he was looking at me that he was going to search my phone if I fell asleep, and I made a point to remember where I placed it before I slept, knowing the messages were still there in my inbox.

I wake up and it's been moved, and clearly looked through. I glare at him, he asks me what he did, then cuts the act and tells me to leave. Then states that he DID get me a gift and he forgot, and shoves the little camera I'd expressed interest in at me, although it's not wrapped and seemed like he bought it while he was out of town. I ask him what he saw, and he told me he only saw the messages and that I needed to leave. I respect that and he takes me home.

Once I get inside he immediately texts me telling me he still loves and cares about me. I know what I did was wrong and express this, and tell him I already knew it was wrong the second I posted it and just needed to feel worthy of something. We argued for at least 5 hours over text, and it was mainly me telling him why it happened and that I was sick of not feeling respected, unheard and untrusted by him- it seems ironic I know, but this was a reoccurring issue. He tells me that hes tried to change and be less passive aggressive, and that what I did was the worst thing anyone has ever done to him. I try to tell him that he constantly shuts me up, leaving me to go to my friends and reddit for emotional support. I dont think what I did was the worst thing I could have done and I immediately knew I messed up and stopped, he didnt even see what i posted because it was deleted, just that I had.

I don't know what to do, he still wants to be with me but I've had enough of him disregarding my boundaries when I've given him my full trust and listened to any problems hes had. I planned on telling him about what happened when I was in a better mental place, but he forced it by looking on my account then got furious and made it seem like we were done, before turning around saying he wants to make things better through a text the minute I'm out of site. I know I messed up, and I'm tired of feeling this way.",29Dec2019,1

So to be honest, at my job we usually have one of the owners (who is 49F) come in an help us out just in case it gets to busy. Sometimes she’ll talk to me about the tv shows she likes and she’ll just randomly come by and see what I’m doing on my phone. I personally enjoy these talks we have. For example she wears these rings around almost all of her fingers because it’s supposedly a trend in her homeland. I asked about it and she took one of her rings and put it on my finger and asked me to wear and see if it’s comfortable. Later when I was getting ready to leave, i was planning to give it back but she said to keep as an extra Christmas present. To make things worse for me is that these rings are 14k gold. Heck I even told her that ring that she put on me was already to much to accept but she ends up putting it on my ring finger and I know that she noticed that it was my ring finger she ended up giggling in the middle of helping me put it on. I met her sister and she asked me if I was married, I don’t recall her(49F) saying yes or no. But I did say no to her sister and said it was a gift from her(49F).Heck even my coworker asked in front of her(49F) if I was married and I almost choked on my water but she then didn’t say anything from what I remember. Maybe just a chuckle. 

They later took us out to a company dinner and one of the owners ( 1st man) explains to me how to serve drinks in their culture. He specifically tells me because and I quote “they want to take a shot with you” it ends up being the other two Ladies. Yes I know, it’s a bit confusing. So I got drunk that night and the next day the (49F)starts to question me why I didn’t go to drink with her even more after at karaoke. I didn’t really understand because sadly they don’t speak good English. I did promise them I would next time. 

That next time happened to be week after and I went to drink and eat with them, (all 3 of them). She let me know by whispering into my ear and saying if she wanted to give me a ride all the way to Food Shop and to my house to change. Heck she even said to keep the info on the low. But later on would say if I wanted to invite one of my close coworkers but out of pretty much jealousy I made a factual excuse for him but did tell her to ask him if she wanted to. My coworker would later on tell me that she(49F) never told him. It seemed that the other (50F) was under the impression that he would come as well. After all that I went to drink with them and I did tend to notice that she (49F) would grab a hold on my arm a couple of times, grabbed my nose and heck at times slap my back because I looked at her confused when she spoke about ass. Like I said broken English. But the thing is I couldn’t keep up with them, when we went to karaoke I was just knocked out and sleeping quite a bit. I sang a line or two but couldn’t keep up. I ended up calling it a night. It looked like she was disappointed with me leaving early but to be honest im not a heavy drinker and I couldn’t handle it. 

The next day she looked a bit worried and asked why I didn’t drink slow. We did talk a bit about what happened that day and chuckle about some of the stuff and the rest of the day was normal. The thing is, that next day, which was yesterday it did get quite busy at work so she’s back there helping out. But all I hear her is laughing it up my coworker about who knows what. Of course it bothers me for a bit. Surprisingly One of my coworkers old friend comes in and she’s a really pretty lady. I noticed that the (49F) noticed that and honestly seemed to change her demeanor a bit. To be honest I was annoyed and jealous because like this whole day we didn’t have a conversation or heck even say hello. Am I NEEDY? So I’m leaving for the day and I ask if she listened to the song I recommend her and said yes and told me she liked it and said that her sister sent me chocolates as an apology for being really touchy with me which was nice of her. I talked to her about that day and she told me about how NEXT TIME I should drink more slow so I can sing. So I said yea. 

Now that you know what some minor things happened around this month. My question is about whether or not I should be acting this way, feeling jealous and feeling depressed I guess. 

I know I have a crush on her but sometimes I get the vibe that she might be into me, like when she makes comment about me being cute or heck even before we went to the company dinner she said that maybe it can be me and her only. Which I replied sure. But sometimes I get a different vibe. I a vibe I don’t like. Surprisingly my coworker would notice this with me and her and egg me on. Making slight comments like, “when it comes to making decisions about the work place you can sway her decision because she’ll take you seriously”. Or give me looks of encouragement when I’m talking to her. Small things like that. 

Should I be feeling this way? Do you think she is interested me to a certain point or is only her personality that she’s like that. Can I really expect her to invite me next time for drinks sooner rather than later? I would really appreciate your advice. Thank you.",29Dec2019,1

Every night the hundreds of people working in the mazes would line up and would be given makeup depending on the section of the ship they were working.

Not sure why, but the makeup artist I was assigned to painted me completely black after I told them I was in a dark part of the ship. Maybe he was having a bad night. Either way he told me to close my eyes while he did the makeup and I opened them to find he painted every part of my head, face, and neck black.

Most of my coworkers were from Long Beach and African American. I received a lot of heckling and rough treatment from my coworkers throughout the night. I dreaded heading to the common break room and dealing with multiple people being offended and aggressive with me over the horrible makeup work I received.

When I got home I ranted about it on Facebook and other social networks and posted a picture of it.

I dread the day that I’m in a position where that picture will be dug up and used against me, especially since I had little to do with its conception.

I did not want my sister to end up in jail and tried to avoid calling the cops as much as humanly possible. All that I asked for was assistance from other family members in the form of meetings and talks. The issue is over for me and has been for a long time.

I don't really have the capacity for childish behavior anymore, so I tend to cut off and walk away. Easier on the mind and soul.

No more video games, inappropriate music, or programming associated with video games. A majority of my design notes apply to video games and those will be discarded.

My whole life, I've been obsessed with certain fictional characters/cartoons. Usually, that fixation fades away as a child grows older, but it never did with me. I've never thought anything of it until now, with this specific character.
2 years ago, I got obsessed with a character named Gerald Broflovski from the adult cartoon South Park. I don't even know how it happened.. But I just started drawing him and my love for him has developed into a lot. I'm legitimately /obsessed/ with him. I made an Alternate Universe where he is severely mentally ill, which is something I did with a lot of characters for some reason. I draw him all the time, in fact he's really all I draw. I write about him, i roleplay as him and absolutely love to talk about him with other people.

Now y'all may not think that's weird because a lot of people do that, but here's where it gets weird. I've had actual fantasies about him, and feel severely attracted to him (sexually, too.) I daydream about him in class, I create stories with him as I try to fall asleep. He makes me happy and excited. I've never drawn nsfw with him, but I've roleplayed it and imagined it. 
Another weird thing is that while I love him, i would rather /be/ him than be in a relationship with him (though if I could only do the latter I would gladly accept.) I don't even want to be in a relationship with a real person because my attachment to him is so strong. Sometimes when I'm in a situation that makes me anxious or something, I pretend to be him. I don't act like him while in public or anything, I just act like myself but pretend people see me as him.

My mom is worried about me because she doesn't think this is normal at all, especially the fact I want to be/date him/am attracted to him.

I know its such an odd character to develop a fixation for, haha! 

Some additional information I'd like to add that might help with answers is that I have been diagnosed with ADD(now just ADHD, but I'm not so hyperactive), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, and OCD. 
Currently, we are thinking I may have High-functioning Autism (aka Asperger's) that went unnoticed throughout my childhood. I share many symptoms with Autism, and I think this might be a 'special interest', but I'm not sure if this would qualify. 
The reason I'm adding my mental disorders is because this could be associated with one, I dunno - that's why I'm here, after all.

If anyone can answer my question, give me advice and inputs, or anything like that, thank you so much!",29Dec2019,1

My mom died last week and I didn’t even tear up even though we were very close. For some reason I felt like laughing when she died and had to hold it in while everyone else was crying which creeps me out.

I care deeply about others but at the same time it feels like I don’t care about anything which makes me feel really weird and I’m not sure if somethings wrong with me or I am overthinking it ?",29Dec2019,1

75,"Idk if this is the right place to be posting this but I wanted to share what I think of this topic. The main reason I want to talk about this is thanks to an Instagram account that goes by the @ ""tailhole2"" (yes this is not his first account).

This guy, tailhole, also known as Matthew, thanks to some people on IG ""exposing"" him (see @/ferretflops), has brought some info on that fucker. After I read about him, I went to see how common people like him are. Thanks to the internet I now know people are even worse than I thought. I cannot bring myself to believe what they say. Zoophiles (or animal fuckers) usually argue that the animal would seek sexual intimacy from their owners or that they don't hurt or they even consent, and some straight up rape them. The thing is though, animals cannot give consent, just as a child. I mean, the dog's brain works basically the same as a toddler's. You see what I'm saying? Zoophiles are trying to sugarcoat what they think is okay. Not to mention the fact most animals cannot handle a human penis. Yes, even women zoophiles are not excused you fucking simps.

81," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ on email replies and said it in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. Sometimes she will ask me something related to jobs etc then when is she whatever is ya she will abruptly reply ‘did yer’ in what seems a snotty/sarcastic way 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

90,"Hey guys, I wanted to share a story you guys might enjoy. I'm going to jump right into it. 

Things got really dark in my home with my parents. One common thing my Mom would do to try and hurt me was accuse me of horrific sexual activity. My parents are immigrant FOBs, but thanks to HBO my parents know all this fucked up sexual shit they otherwise would have no clue about.

As a kid my Mom would accuse me of being in gangbangs, orgies, prostitution, etc. These accusations had no basis in reality, but it's hurtful when your own parents are accusing you of horrific activity.  At first it really bothered me, but as it continued I realized my parents knew I wasn't involved in any of this activity, but they were just trying to hurt my feelings.

Anyway, my mom and I were arguing one day and she starts screaming that she found a ""vibrator"" in my room. I was used to my mom's baseless claims, but the fact that she was referencing a vibrator so confidently had me confused. I could tell she was acting as if she had ""found something"". Still though, I don't own a vibrator so I had no clue what she had in mind.


Well, at this time I had been working on bread board projects, and had recently purchased a high end ceramic soldering iron. It had a white ceramic heating element that would heat up to  [1100 degrees F](https://americanstainedglasscompany.com/media/hakko_456.jpg)


At this point I'm sure you can see where this is going :)  One day my mom got curious about said vibrator...

While I was out with my friends my mom went into my room, plugged in the ""vibrator"", waited for the element to glow red hot and pressed it into the palm of her hand.

91,"Lately, things have been going awfully.

First, my aunt got cancer, and I've already lost two uncles because of it and, even though we've all tried to be optimistic about it, it was terrible news.

Then, last Monday I woke up, finally in my hometown for Christmas to discover that my grandmother is in the hospital. She's doing okay, little by little recovering from what happened to her. I can't really explain it in English as it is not my first language, but it got us all by surprise and, as a consequence, my mother did not spend Christmas with us as she needed to accompany my grandma.

Well, this afternoon I've just been informed that one of my best friends is in the hospital. It is not fully clear, but there's a possibility that she tried to kill herself and we still don't know whether she's fine or we're going to lose her. 

And I'm trying to wear a smile anywhere I go, specially because I've been struggling with depression since I graduated from high school three years ago and I thought I was finally getting out of all this shit, but everything that has happened lately has not been easy.

94,"I've had a rough life. Not the worst but definitely not a good one. 

When I was 14 I was raped. The cops found me battered and going in and out of consciousness. I had no bra on but I did have a white shirt so they charged me with indecent exposure. I was told that he was a boy and I should have protected myself better and I was just as much to blame. I believed that for sooooo long. 

When I was 16 my step dad molested and tried to have sex with me. I was able to get away though. I never told my mom this but I told her about the other creepy stuff that he did, like watch me undress, comment on my figure and bra size, and the gross pics I found on his computer. I thought I was just being crazy and it was a one time mistake. Looking back I know I was wrong. I've expressed my dislike for him and that I wish my mother would leave him. She divorced him but now they are living together again. 

Growing up he would make disgusting comments about other women right in front of my mom. I could see the embarrassment on her face but she just let it slide. I can see now that this is normalizing the behavior of crossing boundaries with no repercussions. 

She knows how much I dislike him so purposely did not tell me they were living together before we came back for the holidays. 

I did have one boundary that she knew about. I told her, ""if there are guns in the house we will not be staying with you"". I have a very curious climbing  5 year old son who gets into everything. She said fine she would move them to a different location. 

I get here and she has not moved them. She just put them on a shelf. She got mad at me and said I was being ridiculous when I demanded she actually move them. They were her husbands guns and he needed them for protection. 

I feel like I was raised to put the man's wants over a woman's boundaries. This has led to a tumultuous marriage. My husband cheated before we we married and I always thought he would get his shit together after we got married. I truly love him but the boundaries crossed have really ruined me. Of course he cheated after marriage. When I put my foot down and said no more cheating he would call off our marriage so he could go out and cheat without it actually being cheating. I have let this behavior go on and with everything from my childhood I feel like I've been pushed over my emotional limit. We're both seeking professional mental help now. 

My MIL has always called me racist names and I've just had to live with it but I see now that's just one more boundary that shouldn't have been crossed. There was a huge incident with her recently that has made me go no contact and I used to miss her but now I am indifferent. I used to try so hard to win her affection and blessing but now I couldnt care less. I can't change my race and if she wants to hate me and her grandchild so be it. She will miss out on his life. 

How do I learn boundaries as an adult and how do I instill that in my son? How do I let my mom know I now have boundaries without loosing her?",29Dec2019,1

While driving through town a cat suddendly crossed the street (I couldn't see it comming since the cat was behind a guardrail) and hit the my car going 50kph (~25mph). I then felt and heard it hitting the underside of my car. I had a huge panick attack and started swearing and went into a huge state of denial. I forgot to look back to see if it was still alive. I turned around at the next roundabout to check on it, frightened to see it dead on the road. But it wasnt there, it probably crawled somewhere else to die in peace, away from us destructive humans.

I'm just really scared that I'm going to be left without a place to go. For background, here's the list of involved parties:
Me - 21 yr old male. 
My bf - 25 yr old male.
My dad - 55+ male.
My stepmom - 50+ female. 

I currently live with my parents, and they are traditionalist Christians. And I live in an area where my salary cannot cover the cost of living. I've been dating my bf for just over a year. Last April, they found out that I had been seeing him from a thirdhand party. I know my dad to be a hard man, but just. However, the last time the topic of my sexuality was brought up, I was told secondhand from my stepmom that he said he would kick me out. 

I had developed a fear of being left to fend for myself, so when I was exposed last April, his anger was compounded by the lies I was telling. 

The topic was dropped until this morning. I continued to avoid telling them of my relationship. I re-addressed the topic this morning with my stepmother. As disappointed as she was with my lying, she doesn't want to see me destitute. She talked to my dad to brace him,  and he became angry. I'm terrified that I'll be left without a home. My stepmom at least let me leave the house to calm down, but she wants us to talk. 

She believes my fear is actually guilt. I don't know how to get her to see that it is, in fact, fear.

I realised that maybe it would be really fun if I found a way to be that single soldier in that company . Re-enactment is immediately out the question . 14 , no money and no groups near me . Great .

I’m not sure if I’m in the right place. I just wanted to gather some thoughts. 

I’m 24 (M) and I haven’t had sex in 9 months. I know that may not sound like the end of the world but I feel like it is. It has went down hill over the last two years. 

I was in a long relationship with a girl for almost 2 years from 2015-2017. Well it fizzled down to an end late 2017. After that I graduated college and lived at home for a year to save money. Well over that year I rarely went on any dates because living at home and dating is tough to be honest. I finally found a girl last summer (2018) and we had a thing for around 3 months till it came to a end. Over the last year I have seriously only been on 3 dates and had sex I once. It’s been so long now just the thought of getting a girl into bed with me gives me anxiety that I’m not going to be good enough.

116,"I'm 24M, turning 25 in March. I'm on the autism spectrum (officially diagnosed with Asperger's) and I'm described as ""high-functioning"" because I'm verbal, talkative, extroverted and have decent social skills. That being said, I really feel like this label downplays how much I struggle in life and how overwhelming it can get. I also have a few mental health issues which are not related to being on the spectrum. 

A while ago, I made a post asking for advice on dating and where I could meet compatible women. I got some constructive advice, but after asking around in some other places and doing some soul searching I came to the realization that I'm probably not cut out for a relationship right now. I still live with my parents, I'm still in school but my employment situation after I graduate in April will be a long way from guaranteed, and I don't drive and depend a lot on Ubers and rides from other people to get around. I've started to feel like I need to sort out my own shit before I try to date anyone.

I also made a post asking about broadening my social horizons, since I don't have a lot of friends and the friends that I do have I don't see very often. But once again, I've started to look inward and realized that I'm way behind in the life milestone department. Almost everyone my age, and tons of people who are younger than me (sometimes several years younger than me) is either living independently or has concrete plans to live on their own, while I honestly don't feel like I'll be able to move out of my parent's house at any point in the foreseeable future. The fact that I don't drive is also a pretty major hurdle, since in my part of the world driving is a must (there's basically no public transportation) and I'm totally dependent on Uber drivers and people I know to get me from place to place. 

Whenever anything relating to these issues comes up in conversation, people start talking to me differently and see me as being like a child, or at least as being different from them. Like I said in another post, when people I know are hanging out I sometimes will ask about that, and they've said things like ""yeah, we'll see if we can bring you along next time"", and then it just doesn't happen. I don't hold this against them. I'm developmentally behind everyone else - that's just a fact - and it's next to impossible for me to catch up.

I've tried to solve these problems, but even though I'm not flat out banned from driving I have a very strong, safety-related government recommendation not to drive because my reaction time is so slow. As for the independent living, even if I get the job I'm looking for straight out of school, it really doesn't pay very much, and because of a bunch of mental health issues that aren't related to being on the autism spectrum, I really don't have the energy or stamina to work full time (around 25-30 hours per week seems to be my limit). Honestly, I'll probably be in my early to mid 30's by the time I'm able to live on my own. Even then, I'll probably really struggle to support myself and it might end up just being too much for me to handle. Everything just feels so...all or nothing when it comes to being a functional adult. And more and more all the time I feel like I'm just not cut out for it. 

**But I absolutely fucking hate where my life is right now. I'm fucking miserable, losing hope and wishing that I was never born, and just getting exhausted with having to constantly fight my own brain just so that I can have even the tiniest chance at a normal life. It's so overwhelming, and I feel like I'm giving it all I've got and getting nowhere. I'm starting to just feel done with existence. I am NOT suicidal. I don't even want to die, I want to go back in time to prevent myself from ever being born. I fucking hate my existence. I feel like a fucking failure of a human being, stuck in a fucking pathetic, empty, broken life with pretty much no hope of improvement.** 

Before anyone asks, I thought I'd clear some issues up:

 I'm diagnosed with treatment-resistant anxiety disorder and treatment-resistant depression. Since I was six years old I've seen nine therapists, gone through more types of therapy and medication changes than I can remember, been given a ton of different supplements, and cut gluten, sugar and dairy out of my diet. None of it has done much to help. My current therapist has been quite honest that this may be something that I'll always live with in some capacity and that I might not be able to get rid of it, just manage it and hopefully reduce it. 

I don't drive because I also have a very slow reaction time, and I've gotten a strong recommendation from the government not to drive for my own safety and the safety of others. I'm not flat out banned from driving, but it's been strongly recommended that I don't. 

I have tried to join groups for other people on the autism spectrum. Several in fact. And I really don't fit in with other people on the autism spectrum at all. I have better luck with people who aren't on the spectrum, in fact. 

There's a supported housing program in my area where once a month a sort of coach comes in to inspect people's living space and make sure it's being kept presentable, finances are being managed, etc., but I don't qualify for this program because I'm apparently too ""high functioning"" for it.",29Dec2019,1

So to be honest, at my job we usually have a (49F) come in an help us out just in case it gets to busy. Sometimes she’ll talk to me about the tv shows she likes and she’ll just randomly come by and see what I’m doing on my phone. I personally enjoy these talks we have. For example she wears these rings around almost all of her fingers because it’s supposedly a trend in her homeland. I asked about it and she took one of her rings and put it on my finger and asked me to wear and see if it’s comfortable. Later when I was getting ready to leave, i was planning to give it back but she said to keep as an extra Christmas present. To make things worse for me is that these rings are 14k gold. Heck I even told her that ring that she put on me was already to much to accept but she ends up putting it on my ring finger and I know that she noticed that it was my ring finger she ended up giggling in the middle of helping me put it on. I met her sister and she asked me if I was married, I don’t recall her(49F) saying yes or no. But I did say no to her sister and said it was a gift from her(49F).Heck even my coworker asked in front of her(49F) if I was married and I almost choked on my water but she then didn’t say anything from what I remember. Maybe just a chuckle. 

They later took us out to a company dinner and one of the owners ( 1st man) explains to me how to serve drinks in their culture. He specifically tells me because and I quote “they want to take a shot with you” it ends up being the other two Ladies. Yes I know, it’s a bit confusing. So I got drunk that night and the next day the (49F)starts to question me why I didn’t go to drink with her even more after at karaoke. I didn’t really understand because sadly they don’t speak good English. I did promise them I would next time. 

That next time happened to be week after and I went to drink and eat with them, (all 3 of them). She let me know by whispering into my ear and saying if she wanted to give me a ride all the way to Food Shop and to my house to change. Heck she even said to keep the info on the low. But later on would say if I wanted to invite one of my close coworkers but out of pretty much jealousy I made a factual excuse for him but did tell her to ask him if she wanted to. My coworker would later on tell me that she(49F) never told him. It seemed that the other (50F) was under the impression that he would come as well. After all that I went to drink with them and I did tend to notice that she (49F) would grab a hold on my arm a couple of times, grabbed my nose and heck at times slap my back because I looked at her confused when she spoke about ass. Like I said broken English. But the thing is I couldn’t keep up with them, when we went to karaoke I was just knocked out and sleeping quite a bit. I sang a line or two but couldn’t keep up. I ended up calling it a night. It looked like she was disappointed with me leaving early but to be honest im not a heavy drinker and I couldn’t handle it. 

The next day she looked a bit worried and asked why I didn’t drink slow. We did talk a bit about what happened that day and chuckle about some of the stuff and the rest of the day was normal. The thing is, that next day, which was yesterday it did get quite busy at work so she’s back there helping out. But all I hear her is laughing it up my coworker about who knows what. Of course it bothers me for a bit. Surprisingly One of my coworkers old friend comes in and she’s a really pretty lady. I noticed that the (49F) noticed that and honestly seemed to change her demeanor a bit. To be honest I was annoyed and jealous because like this whole day we didn’t have a conversation or heck even say hello. Am I NEEDY? So I’m leaving for the day and I ask if she listened to the song I recommend her and said yes and told me she liked it and said that her sister sent me chocolates as an apology for being really touchy with me which was nice of her. I talked to her about that day and she told me about how NEXT TIME I should drink more slow so I can sing. So I said yea. 

Now that you know what some minor things happened around this month. My question is about whether or not I should be acting this way, feeling jealous and feeling depressed I guess. 

I know I have a crush on her but sometimes I get the vibe that she might be into me, like when she makes comment about me being cute or heck even before we went to the company dinner she said that maybe it can be me and her only. Which I replied sure. But sometimes I get a different vibe. I a vibe I don’t like. Surprisingly my coworker would notice this with me and her and egg me on. Making slight comments like, “when it comes to making decisions about the work place you can sway her decision because she’ll take you seriously”. Or give me looks of encouragement when I’m talking to her. Small things like that. 

Should I be feeling this way? Do you think she is interested me to a certain point or is only her personality that she’s like that. Can I really expect her to invite me next time for drinks sooner rather than later? I would really appreciate your advice. Thank you.",29Dec2019,1

120,"This fucking site is driving  me insane. I can't do it anymore. Anywhere I go I see politics, I get anxious over things I can't change or control, things that even if I didn't know, nothing would change in my life. I spent hours arguing with complete strangers, wondering why they don't support   the same things I support, and even if I change their view (which never happens) what  will I accomplish? Exactly. NOTHING. I argue on the internet for hours non stop and I gain NOTHING. 


Even if I keep a promise to myself to not visit political subreddits again, this fucking site is designed to make you bounce around from subreddit to subreddit and eventually I find myself  doing the same things again.


I suspect I got some kind of phycological damage from this shit. Even when Im not online and Im, let's just say, at the mall, My mind will still be focused in my previous conversations I made  with these complete strangers, and how Im gonna reply them.



And Let's not even  talk about the constant flow of  information my mind absorbs every day. I wonder how it hasn't exploded yet. All that trash I put into it.

The first thing I do in the morning is to check if anyone has replied to my comments. Ohhh this feeling when I see the red notification on the screen. It's a fucking drug. I have friends. But it's different when someone replies you online and you see that red think.

Like what they have to say is very important and my life will change or some shit. 

Spoiler alert, most of the times it's useless crap.  

Im pretty sure you feel the same way when you open your phone and you see the red notification. 



That's it. Im done. Fuck you all.",29Dec2019,1

Then I was born and kinda got all the attention that his son would have had.

133,"sorry if this breaks rules it’s a cry for help

So just to put it out there firstly I have never had a am sex, put anything up my rear or anything that I can think would cause this.

About a year ago I thought I had anal fissure as all the signs were showing that I did, I had blood and pain with bowl movement as well as an itch like feeling, went to the doctor and they said I was wrong and they diagnosed me with anal warts which is where it got scary.

Anyway my idea about the fissure was written off, after going into the sex clinic as recommended, they tried to freeze dry them off which caused massive pain and unknown to them I did indeed have a fissure.

I went bck to the doctors explained this and they finally referred me to the surgeon, I’ve had 3:4 “removals now” where they removal warts but end up leaving a few, due to the large gap the warts seem to recreate.

Due to the removals they keep adding scar tissue which makes the hole smaller so going to the toilet is near to impossible.

After going back into my notes on the last procedure, they agreed I had a fissure and removed it with Botox injection, they removed a couple warts but again left loads and now they have grown massively in size and it looks like I have 3 massive lumps coming out the anus, this is causing massive discomfort everyday, I am signed off work which is affecting my mental state. I am always in pain I just would like to know if they’re is someone out there that will know more about it than my doctors as it seems to be on deaf ears and I don’t want to live like this. 

It seems to be that the issue is not as serious to them as I think it is, procedures have a long gap 6 weeks I between so it seems to long, the issue has now spread to my penis and the pain seems to be way deeper now in the anal cavity. Thank you reddit any help given is amazing,",29Dec2019,1
