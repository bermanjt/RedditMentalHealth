1,"I just had a fight with my SO over food. So my SO doesn't like pork and always refuses it. I aware of that and would try to pick any dishes that contain pork whenever we went out. Recently we traveled oversea together and pork is a very common ingredient in the country we visited. But I still tried to suggest and pick places that offered other kind meats  even though there were many pork dishes I've always wanted to try. Although he suggested I could go to those place by myself or could just watch me eat, I refused because I wanted to do something that both can enjoy and didn't try them. That was a mistake. 

Recently my SO took another trip with friend and they went to the restaurant that I wanted to try out. He ate the dish that  I wanted to try but didn't because he doesn't like pork. I feel betrayed because he tried something that he said he would never eat and we've always been avoiding it. I feel regret for not doing what I wanted and now I feel resented. I feel stupid for feeling mad and upset and caused us to fight. I hate myself to feel this way and I can't get it out of mind.",18Jun2019,2
2,"I have a tendency to run away from *anything* for fear of it being not real. All thanks to a few ex's who were really good at lying. 😖

I keep finding myself on the verge of quitting relationships regularly, relationships I have even been in for years and years, because I am afraid of being lied to so much I would just rather get lost in the wilderness, literally. And the part that pisses me off about all of it is I *KNOW* they are good relationships. But the fear that I could be in love with a monster is enough to make me want to run alone with coyotes chasing me instead. 

I've spent so much time thinking on this fear, trying to overcome it like I do so many other things. And then I worry if I am the partner not being good to my loves because of this fear I have of being duped.

I feel like I walk this fine line of trying to run away and find my safe space alone, but my safe space is in their arms too and that makes me sick a little because I feel like I lack control over my own idea of happiness. I want to be wild and free and have no ties... but I also want to be tied to someone, be completely vulnerable, and trust someone else to protect my heart forever. 

I don't understand why I feel this way about people, but animals I instantly am attached to for life, without fear of the day they leave me (which is inevitable.)

9,"I think I've finally come to terms with myself today. I've been like Dr Frankenstein. I think I can subdue and control the monster, but as that story goes it evidently is never controlled. 


I have come to realize that I'm severely mentally ill. Mostly depression. I've been like this for so long, I just thought it is who I am. I never liked to think of it as mental illness because I didn't want to use it as  an excuse to fuck up my life, but I've been fucking up my life for so long without the scapegoat. 

I've looked online and I just need to get an appointment or two. Get some meds, someone to talk too. I'm not worried about the money. I don't have insurance, and the good ol proletarian lifestyle doesn't leave much room for this kind of shit. All I can think about is ways of dying and nothing or nobody else, which scares me because I feel like that means I'm at the end of my rope. (Hehehe, get it, rope) 

I see other people posting this kind of stuff, and I do take a great deal of solace knowing that others need not the sufferings of the outer world and can punish themselves immensely just for even existing at all, just as I do likewise. 

Would love some advice if you read this far on possibilities of recovery. I have never sought help. Did a bit of councilling with a psychotherapist before, didn't seem to help. Guess I'll have to try again. Thanks for your time reddit.",18Jun2019,1
10,"I’m not sad or anything, not depressed, not anxious, I’m not in need of money, Im in great health, by my own definition, I’m pretty successful. Shit, I have more money in the bank at 20 than most 30-35ish year olds. 

When I was little I was heavily abused by my parents. What at the time hurt the most is the reason the abuse started and what it meant. My mom slapped me when I told her my older brother had been bullying me in school. She told me, “shut up, you’re just lying because you’re jealous of your brother” didn’t even bother looking into it, just said I was lying. 

Developed pretty bad depression, social anxiety and selective mutism. I isolated myself from literally everyone and grew to hate my family/extended family. I never really developed social skills. 

Somewhere around the last week of HS my shit all went away over night. Became really happy but still struggled to make friends. 

Enlisted in the marine corps and everything was magically there. I regularly talk to people, text, etc to outsiders I’m perfectly “normal” to myself though, it still feels as if I’m missing something. Which is friends.

My parents, the people who are supposed to love me don't do anything to help either in fact I have a fucking list of the different ways my mother has said that she hates me to my face and made no attempts to apologize for any of this. all of this keeps making my grades lower and lower and I keep getting harassed by my mother for this which contributes to the dropping of my grades and more of my so called friends making fun of me for doing poorly.

I could’ve been lucky to actually find it in my house, could’ve been lucky to have the person who found it give it back to me, I could’ve been lucky enough to just not lose it. But I didn’t get lucky. So many things in my life have been bad luck. I don’t even remember the last time I was happier as a result of luck. I’ve been down on my luck and it’s just making the problems I’m already facing worse. My depression just keeps getting exacerbated because every time I get better some shit like this happens. For the first time in my life I saw a therapist and thought that maybe, just maybe, my parents were capable of being supportive. Then, my switch goes disappears  and so does everything good that had happened to me recently. I can’t understand why I’m expected to put up with this everyday for 16 years. I know life is unfair and it’s all a game of luck by why does my luck have to be so bad? I know other people have felt way worse and have been way more unlucky, but that doesn’t mean that my pain is invalid. I’ve been through 16 years of bad luck.

19,"We only have one mother and one father, and from the moment we were born, we relied on them heavily for everything. A parent's love is the closest thing resembling unconditional, selfless love that we can find within the universe, and because we have a strong affinity with our parents, we were born into their lives, becoming a significant part of the being. The special bond we share with our parents is often taken for granted because it's all we've ever known, experiencing their undying love from our very first breath until their very last. Today I'd like to highlight the many ways our parents' love have impacted our lives and how we can practice filial piety as an expression of our gratitude and appreciation towards them.

**Parent's Sacrifices**

Like ourselves, most of our parents had their own dreams and ambitions in life, whether it was to travel the world, start a business, realize their dream job, or work on their hobbies. Before they introduced us into their lives, our parents were just kids themselves in a sense, following their hearts and chasing their passions. However, from the day we were born, their lives would never be the same again. Everything was no longer about themselves anymore, and not only did they have to put aside their personal ambitions and interests, they also had to learn the way of parenting, a life long lesson that no textbook or teacher can ever prepare you for. Our parents could only gather their confidence, count on their parent's intuition, hold their spouse's hand, and learn as they went, growing into their roles a day at a time. And for many parents, like mine, they even had to walk the path of parenthood singlehanded and assume the roles of both mother and father. It is said that only when one becomes a parent does one truly begin to appreciate the sacrifices and efforts parents go through for their babies, and I am yet to fathom this meaning completely.

All parents will also tell you that for the first two to three years of a new born's life, they could not leave the infant's side. Not only did they have to be available around the clock for anything we required such as feeding, cuddling, changing nappies, showers, and putting us to sleep, our parents did all this on minimum, poor quality, broken sleep. When our parents were exhausted, stressed, and feeling helpless, they had no choice but to carry on, shouldering the burden all on themselves, because if not them, then who? To our parent, no one else could ever love us the way they do. Although we were physically there with our parents from day one, we were completely oblivious to their hardship and sacrifices. Now that we are older and more aware, shouldn't we express our gratitude and appreciation for all that they've done for us while we still have the chance?

**Unconditional Love**

Over the course of our lives, our parents have provided for our education, food, clothing, shelter, emotional support, and much much more, doing so unconditionally, without expecting anything in return. It's inconceivable the profound love our parents have for us and how perfectly willing they are to just keep giving when all we ever do is take. Not only that, how many of us are thankful, acknowledge their efforts, or express our appreciation? Many of us not only take our parent's love for granted, but we often blame and complain when we don't get our way. But our parents never mind, they just keep on loving us the same way, the only way they know how.'

Our parents provide us with everything we need to live the best life they can offer, ensuring we are always healthy and happy. Our happiness is their joy, and our pain is their suffering. When we scored good grades, landed our first job, or met our first love, our parents shared in our happiness and success. When we were sick, got injured in an accident, or experienced severe disappointment or setbacks, our parents also shared in our suffering, wanting nothing more than to bear all our pain for us. Nowhere else will we find anyone that loves us so unconditionally and selflessly the way our parents love us.

**Filial Piety**

Being mindful of all that they have done for us and all they are still doing, how can we truly show our gratitude and appreciation? In eastern culture, filial piety is the single most important value a person can cultivate because it is a sign one recognizes the compassion and kindness of their parents. It is also why they take great pride in being a caring, respectful, and respectful son and daughter. Consequently, these values are passed down from generation to generation and when it is the child's turn to become a parent, their children will learn from the example they have set and also grow up with strong filial values.

To practice filial piety and express our gratitude for our parents' continual love and support, we must learn to look after their physical and emotional well-being. This means offering everything within our means to ensure our parents live in joy and comfort, that they have enough food to eat, a comfortable place to live, have meaningful and fulfilling work and activities, and have all the emotional support they need to live free from fear, stress, and anxiety. Not only do we aim to return all they have given us, but we should also try to return much more. When we can provide more than past generations, it is a sign of improvement and progress, and it represents the progression of humanity as a society.

**Conclusion**

Our parents have provided the foundation and all the necessary conditions for us to have the life we have today. If not for their kindness and compassion, we would be worse off without question. We must not take for granted the love and support they have given us over the years and continue to give us today. This is why it is essential to practice filial piety, tell our parents we love and appreciate them, look after their well-being, and assume responsibility for their joy and suffering as if it were our own.

We not only owe it to our parents to be good sons and daughters, but it is also our duty as a human being. Because by practicing filial piety and providing our parents with more than they have given us, we ensure our generation is progressing in terms of human values and virtuous qualities, something that no money can buy and no infrastructure can build. We simply need to illuminate our minds with gratitude and appreciation of our parents' kindness and be mindful of their constant selfless sacrifices. Then we are not only repaying their decades of efforts and hard work, but we are also creating a generation and society that's deeply rooted in the values of loving-kindness, sincere gratitude, and great joy.

May we all be the greatest sons and daughters we can be and always hold in our hearts the compassion of our parents, using their unconditional love as a standard for how we should treat one another.

20,"This past March I moved to another city an hour away from my family, friends, the town that I was born and raised in. After these months of self-reflection, it feels as if a small part of me did it as a self-imposed exile. At the time there was a lot of guilt weighing on me for going through one of the worst major depressive episodes I have ever experienced. I almost lost my job, I could barely take care of myself let alone my pet rabbits and had to get help, I failed 2 college courses for the first time in years, I ended probably the best relationship of my life because I was being a toxic partner, and I almost took my life.

So I ran away in shame. Things are slightly better now. I'm on medication that makes me dizzy, but does help with the anxiety. I've been looking for a therapist since last November, that was when my episode really ramped up, my ex and I have remained friends. I passed 1/3 classes. My job understood what I was going through and let me take time to heal and I might be moving into a better position soon. Most of my friends and family understood. I lost a few because of my erratic behavior, but I've made my peace.

30,"About a year ago I rescued a kitten. He was very shy and very sick, riddled with parasites. He eventually got better and started to put on weight. Never having raised a kitten, I did some simple searching on what to do and how to do it. I inevitably found myself deep in kitten memes and cool facts about domesticated cats and big cats. One said something to the effect of ""Dad lions will pretend to be hurt by their cubs when playing"". I'm no lion expert but I thought ""sure, why not?"".

The first time I acted like he hurt me (playfully wincing, *Peter Griffin hurts his knee*, falling down, etc) he was a little shocked but kept playing. And as time went on his confidence grew, latching onto my leg as I walked, ambushing me with open arms. I kept doing the confidence building although sometimes he'd really get me. He then started doing this side hops across the entire room before an attack. (Playful attacks he isn't aggressive at all.)

Side hops became more dramatic and he started doing a cartwheel before his attack. Now, he'll perform up to 3 cartwheels to initiate an ambush. I still do the confidence building and his attacks are getting more hilarious and creative. Still trying to catch it on camera...he is an elusive apex predator. 

TL;DR: Got kitten. Adopted Dad lion cub raising techniques to raise kitten. 1 year later kitten, now cat, attacks me with advanced Kung Fu. I am proud.",18Jun2019,800
31,"All the people at the first pride event wanted was to be accepted. To be treated equal amongst their peers.  They didn't want to be raised or arrested or alienated. They wanted to be seen as human beings worthy of respect. The same as any other.

I guess, now I am assuming the role of trying to speak for them.  However, a lot of what I said above is from interviews I've seen with some of those who were there.

In a wayx to me corporate acceptance and full immersion between Pride and corporations is the ultimate achieved success of the first pride.

Look, you cannot change the minds, views or opinions of every last person out there.  No amount of Pride festivals will ever achieve that. (Or laws, or anything else.)

All the first protestors wanted was to be themselves. We are living in the heart of that acceptance movement. It's time to enjoy it.  Even if that comes with sponsored pride events.  

You can't beg for acceptance, then complain when you are accepted.  Claiming you didn't want the corporate acceptance, you just wanted the low-key small time mom and pop gay operation acceptance .


The next best thing imo is the evolution of pride.  We need a centralized, unified pride week in one city a year. Everyone needs to get tickets and the million home March can descend on whatever country was the harshest on Zthe LGBTQ+ community the previous year. 

Just pride the fuck out that city for a week.  Do it like the originators did.  Be polite, kind and courtesy.  Dance and laugh as you are arrested, have those not arrested pride March the day after first arrests are made.  Made it a global stage with a unified message.  

That of course, is a flawed idea in many ways. To those willing to risk the full potential extremism of whatever government might be in charge of the city that inadvertantly hosts pride, it might be an alright risk.  To others, well. You have to be willing to take that risk, or stay away I guess.  The first Pride ""organizers"" (they admittedly agree there was no ""organization to the event"" just ""fed up and angry citizens"". Knew full well their event could lead to arrest, in a country that was only slightly better to gay people many countries today.   Few Pride marchers since have faced the potential risks that those protesters did then.  

Even if not traveling ""abroad"" just here in the US. (Or Just in any localization, to its respective country/travel zones)  those looking for an ""Organic Pride"" experience should seek out small towns, little pockets throughout the US that have brave individuals totaling un the 100's t e.g. ying to show themselves.  Take your pride there.  Grass roots help with their float, their events, call in friends.  Everybody is just one lesbian away from somebody they can call who kows a member of the Dykes in Bikes.  You tell them what you're trying to do. They'll ride across country and be there.   Go he the Pride heros for a small community that would never be able to stop talking about that one year.",18Jun2019,2
32,"I'm nearly 19 and for my whole life I've drawn. My first memories are of me drawing and loving every moment of it but I can't do that anymore. I know I'm a perfectionist, my sun and moon sign are both virgo, I have personality disorders and issues with ocd so everything points to me being a very emotional and perfectionistic person. As soon as a pencil hits the paper I get an overwhelming amount of anger that without fail results in torn up paper and broken pencils but that never happened when I was a kid. I just want to be able to draw without feeling this dread like when I was little. I'm Australian so for our final two years we have a thing called a HSC (It's basically a bunch of exams and assignments that determine what you can do when you leave) and for art we had a major piece which we worked on for about 18 months and used as our ""end all be all"" kind of thing. I couldn't finish ever finish any of mine and dropped out of high school, started going in and out of hospital, seeing more doctors than I had fingers and always wanting to not exist. I just want to draw without worry anymore and without critiquing everything I do like I did when I was little. I know why I have all these issues but I don't know how to stop them ruining things for me. I'm willing to listen to anyone's advice because at this point I'm so exhausted from trying and feeling like this, I don't even have to energy to act badly on any of these emotions if you get what I mean. :/",18Jun2019,2
33,"Hi friends... I'm not exactly sure if this is the right subreddit to post this in so feel free to point me to a more suitable one if you know of one!

For some background, I (20f) have only had two \*serious\* relationships. Both happened in high school and I haven't been in a relationship since. After my last breakup I tried to do the whole casual dating/sex thing but I realized I got too attached to the guys I would get involved with. I decided to abstain from sex/dating and work on myself. It's been about a year and a half since then and I decided to start dating again.

Basically I met this guy (23m) on hinge a little over a month ago. Things were awesome when we initially matched. We texted everyday and the conversation was flowing so well. I was so excited that I actually met a guy that seemed suitable. We texted for about a week and a half before we went on our first date (he lives about an hour away and drove down to me). We got sushi for dinner and talked for hours.

We even continued to text everyday following the first date. Then a week later, we went on our second date (again, he drove down to me). On this one, we went hiking and I was sweating like a wet dog haha. I was pretty embarrassed by that although I'm not even sure if he minded. I have to admit, the second date didn't feel like the spark I felt on the first.

The few days following the date, he started to get more and more distant to the point where I think he was going to ghost me. A day had passed and he still hadn't responded so I asked him if everything was okay.

He responded saying that he's been struggling with some things the past few weeks and especially in the past few days which was why he wasn't really responding. He said he thought he was ready for a relationship but isn't sure at this point. He said as cliche as it sounds, it had nothing to do with me but more so about the timing of everything going on in his life. Because of all of that he doesn't want to take things further, so that neither of us get hurt. He hopes I don't think that he's a dick but understands if I do and wished me the best in the future.

I replied to him and told him that I understood. I told him that I still think he's a great guy. I wished him luck on his trip abroad next month and that I hope he does well in his grad program. I said that I hope things get better for him &amp; that I'm here for him. I ended with saying that he's welcome to reach out if he figures things out and we could see where we both are at that point.

\---

It's been almost a week since then and I'm still pretty bummed. He seemed like such a great guy and was the most similar to my ideal type. He seemed so down to earth and genuine. To be fair, maybe I have my rose colored glasses on and am more wrapped up in the idea of what we could've been rather than him. I didn't really know him long enough to KNOW him. It's been pretty confusing for me. I feel like I shouldn't be as upset as I am considering that we only talked for a month and didn't even date.

My mind keeps wondering if he had actually lost interest and was just trying to cut me off in a nice way. What if it was something I said or did? I know I was a little awkward on both dates just because I hadn't really been on any real dates. I just really though that it was going somewhere. He even told me all about his group of friends and even about his family. If it really was a timing thing though, I hope we cross paths again one day.

&amp; to clarify, we didn't have sex or anything. We only hugged to greet each other.

Also, don't worry haha I'm in the process of finding a therapist. This whole encounter has made me realize that there are some things that I've repressed that I need to work on. Honestly maybe I wasn't even mentally ready for a relationship, at least not until I work through some of those things.

I think I'm going to continue to update this post with how I feel or my progress in therapy in regards to me relationship with dating. Thank you for reading if you've gotten this far. I just really wanted to be able to release these thoughts and let it go.",18Jun2019,7
34,Now I should preface this by saying this could be absolutely nothing. I work at a pizza place n take calls. Today a woman came in and asked about me and complimented me(for my phone call “taking” abilities or whatever the proper term would be) to my manager to which he then pointed me out u guess she smiled at me the whole time me being awkward I stay near the back and only waved . All my coworkers said I should get her number n she was totally into me and all that. I think she was just nice you know.  Even the manager commented agreed after tho. I’ve been alone my whole life.  Just seems unprofessional but like where else am I really to meet people. I hate the idea of using tinder and I’m fuckin lonely. Anyways that concludes my rant.,18Jun2019,4
35,"2019 has straight up just not been good for me. Here is a list of things that happened:

* I ended off 2018 around my toxic family in a visit so bad I decided I wouldn't be going to their place again for a long time. Winter break, precious time off during which I was supposed to recharge, wasted. My relationship with my mother which was already delicate was now even more damaged.
* At the end of winter break right before New Years,' we arrived home to find one of our cats near death. A friend was supposed to have been checking in on them while we were gone but she did not do her job well. Well, turns out he had an autoimmune disease, and had to be put on steroids. Over the course of the next few months we had to drop probably several thousand dollars (we're scared to total it up) to get care for him and also had to wrestle him into a towel to medicate him twice a day for six months. I desperately hope I can repair my relationship with this animal and have him not be deathly scared of me and extremely skittish someday.
* A few days after returning home, my brother, who I had spent a lot of time during that wasted winter break trying to talk some sense into before his life spirals out of control, got a DUI crashing my mom's car.
* Someone I had been best friends with for a few years decided to blame me for ALL of his problems in a message and then cut me out of his life.
* At work (IT) we were expecting layoffs, and had no idea what the magnitude of them would be. The end result ended up being an entire day of our group of about 20 tight-knit friends sitting in a room waiting to be called to a conference room to be laid off, one by one, seeing all these people I looked up to crying and even holding some of my friends in my arms as they sobbed. I have PTSD from this event.
* One of those friends who got laid off was someone I let myself get extremely close to, only to have her trash our entire friendship by insulting the love of my life to my face and laughing about it with her boyfriend... and expecting me to laugh along, too. All because he was trying to warn her about the potential dangers of certain drugs.
* My father's racism, transphobia, relapsing alcoholism and victim complex got to be too much for me to handle amid so many other things going on, so I called him out for it, and then he threw a bunch of horrible insults at me that weren't true. It made me realize that I have put too much faith in my father and so I cut off our relationship, most likely permanently.
* Right before father's day, my dad got another DUI. This might be his fourth one... The first that I can remember was ten years ago. It made seeing all the posts online very difficult. I shut my phone off for the day.
* My mother hijacked a video call with my sister to ask me about my opinions on abortion. She is the type of person who loves to bring up a controversial topic, then argue with no basis against whatever I say to make me feel like shit. Seriously, she was using FULL TERM abortions as in almost ready to deliver, as a counter argument??? It got very ugly and upset me deeply. With encouragement from my friends, I cut her out too. That meant I was now going through life without either of my parents, and even though they did a shit job and have never really been there for me or helped me through life that much, it still stings when I think about it. I just wish I'd had one figure in my life who prioritized nurturing me as a kid. 
* All of the friends who got laid off have since moved on to find a position that made them happy, but I am stuck here still at this shitty company, another team is taking over our floor and pushing us team remnants into a corner, and my entire new team is remote except for me so I'm totally alone. I was thrown into a new project with no preparation and then the entire team met with my boss behind my back to complain about me. I now am assigned a supervisor and assigned a vague ghost of what my job (which I loved at the time) was a year ago, with no room for innovation or ideas. This job has made me feel so incapable that I am now scared to leave.
* All of this anxiety has exacerbated my several instances of PTSD so that anytime I hear someone moving around the house, opening or closing doors, or dropping something, or anytime I try to have sex, I freeze up and panic even though I am in an entirely safe environment. It's so hard to unlearn these things, I want to and I did at some point in time, but I regress so much when my life gets really stressful.
* From around the time I cut my dad out to now, I have been begging my partner to help me get our house cleaned up because I don't feel like I can do this alone, but only now after two months of begging is he on the same page (apparently), yet we spent today once again dicking around on the internet in separate rooms and not accomplishing anything. Our kitchen smells like mold. We have a carpenter ant problem. There's dirty laundry everywhere. Something in our fridge has gone bad. The city came and mowed our lawn because we didn't do it in time. All the ruckus at our house is a HUGE part of the reason my performance fell at work. I could not have communicated more how much this was fucking with me, and yet nothing changed. He also hasn't gotten his car fixed in two months so we've been using mine for everything and it can't take any more road trips. (He has not always been like this, he is also dealing with some shit within the past few months, so please don't tell me my boyfriend sucks.) I know we need to work together as a team to get out of this but it's so hard to remember to be mindful and kind when all of this is building up. 

I'm not saying that good things haven't happened too. I've had fun with many creative endeavors and have built a few friendships to be much stronger than they were previously. But I'm struggling, and seeing all of this written out together helps me come to terms with the fact that I really have had a rough time. This year has presented me with so many challenges, just like every year before, and it's making me wonder if this chaos is ever going to stop. There has to be more to life than this. I'm 24.

**Now, the reason I wrote this post in the first place, is to perform the following exercise:**

1. **Write down everything that is stressing you out**
2. **Cross out and let go of what you can't control**
3. **Prioritize the things you can**

Things that are out of my control:

* ~~I have to stop trying to help my brother~~. It's hopeless. I wrote a song about it.
* ~~That person cutting me out~~ helped me learn how to let go of toxic people.
* ~~Layoffs~~ \- this was out of my control... there's nothing to learn.
* ~~Friend who insulted my partner~~ moved out of state and is no longer a concern.
* ~~My father~~ \- He needs to stop drinking, then maybe we can talk, but I doubt it.
* ~~My mother~~ \- She will never stop being how she is. It's best to keep my distance.

Of all the things I experienced, only four of them are in my control.

* *I can plan my holidays/breaks better so that they are a time for emotional rejuvenation instead of ruination.*
* *I can continue to provide care for my animals so we don't have another pet health crisis.*
* *I can put in the necessary work at my job and try my best long enough to look for a new one.*
* *I can continue discussion with my partner about improving our relationship, priorities and living space.*

Writing this out has been a very grounding experience, and even if no one else ever reads it, I'm glad I mapped out some things that have been haunting my brain. Throughout all of this even though my mental health was poor I did not try to leave this earth (something I've considered many times in the past) and I'm proud of myself for that.",18Jun2019,6
37,"She’s a coworker of mine, and she kept talking about how “fine” and handsome our male coworker is.  She kept asking about him and BEGGED me to give her his IG info.  I’m not even attracted to her but it’s so annoying seeing girls go crazy over a guy, when no girl has done that for me.  Please don’t say “you never know if a girl likes you”.  When a girl likes you, most likely she’ll at least hint at it.  I’m only 19, but I have done nothing with a girl.  The annoying part is that I have no dating prospects either, so I’ll have to wait until I start college in the fall.  Someday a girl will crush on me, hopefully...",18Jun2019,2
38,"Hi, i am 29 years old this year.

I still live at home with my parents.

I am in and out of jobs and very unstable with it.

&amp;#x200B;

So i want to tell you a bit about me, well quite a bit really, so prepare yourself, this will be draining for some of you out there, i advise a nice cup of coffee and a strong mind.

&amp;#x200B;

I started life as a child like anyone else does, a loving mother, a seemingly loving father.

But things were not right, mum &amp; dad argued, father always went out leaving my mum with 4 kids, dad comes home drunk on the occasion, also gambling money and did not work.

&amp;#x200B;

The arguments my mother and father had were to the point of my mother breaking down into tears every time, though she could definitely throw it back at him. The matter of the fact is both could not get on, but stuck with each other, and this to the detriment of us children and even themselves.

Swearing, throwing stuff, hours of arguments really screwed with myself emotionally and mentally, but it also caused me to behave disruptively which then garnered beatings and abuse from my father because he just could not see anything as his own fault, or think rationally, in fact neither could my mother. And i was not a coward, i would fight and fight, i saw any opportunity to just be myself, so in my fathers eyes i was just not learning through force, so it went from slaps, to using slippers, to using belts, to using solid bamboo.

The punishments got harsher, the pain got worse, the family became even more unstable.

&amp;#x200B;

What i am about to tell you, some will find disturbing, but to me this is my mind and i cannot change it, i can only be the best version of myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to be completely out of whack, i think i was like 5 years old, would poo and pee in my own bedroom and even my brother got in on it too, it makes no sense, i am not a dirty person but i remember clearly how messed up what i did was.

Used to also sneak my fathers tools and dig holes through my bedroom walls, i would also throw major tantrums. However if i think harder, this time in my life did not last too long, this was a further advancement of the mental &amp; emotional abuse.

&amp;#x200B;

This started with fear, i feared my father horrendously, to the point that i would behave completely different, my mother was the push over, my father was the one who is going to inflict pain.

My father was hugely critical of my mother to the point of foul mouthing her size, how she looked and using her as a slave.

My father loves horror movies, he put them on whilst our minds were compromised, but for me it hit me the hardest (or so i would think so) I would piss myself in fear literally, i wanted to go to the toilet but my head was filled with fear to the point that i was paranoid.

The times i mustered the courage to go to the toilet... i would run with adrenaline back to wherever i was, which was normally the floor in the living room with everyone else.

This to my parents was just me acting out or being my usual high energy self, they did not know any of my internal pain or world. My father hated if we played, we made noise, so playing was more a test of if i get caught or not, never knowing if anything i do is right or wrong because everything is punished.

However if i remained quiet and basically invisible to people, i was classed as good as ""good as gold"".

My mother was over protective and was scared of letting us out to play, so playing out never happened beyond interaction with others at school, which was toxic, i became bullied and i would retaliate twice with a knife, luckily in both instances i was caught by a teacher, though my intent was to ward him off, not actually hurt him.

The first time my father actually never punished me.. he had this talk with me which was odd, i felt like i got away with it.

The second time he came home late and i got bounced around the living room.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember a punishment for making so much noise one morning with my brother, i got 30 hits with the bamboo wood and so did my brother across our bare backsides / back.

&amp;#x200B;

I would cover myself with my hands and scream it was hurting, but my father needed to inflict damage and pain.

&amp;#x200B;

My father became narcissistic &amp; wrapped in his own world. At the age of 11 i believe, a final straw was broken and my father hit my brother so hard he put a dent into the metal fire place he hit his head on.

My brother was behind in school, he was also bullied but did not stand up for himself, he also has mild autism.

I was diagnosed with ADHD and well i was just an evil boy to outsiders, and my mum &amp; dad fed on it to create this mask.

I loved and still do love my parents, but i am realizing just how fucked up i am. Most people in fact anyone would say to you right now that i am a lovely guy, i am peaceful, caring and i like helping people, all qualities that are correct, but most if none know the full extent of who i really am, and believe me i am capable of some really cold things.

&amp;#x200B;

At the age of 12 we would all be split up into foster care.

What i thought was normal was not normal.

Adjusting from home to a new life was way harder, and i had no way of relating to anyone or anything that i did, if i was asked why i did things i would just deny it, the truth is i had no reason.

&amp;#x200B;

I was given 2 gerbils as a pet, i killed one of them, i slammed it up against a radiator until it stopped moving. I had no remorse, no feeling, nothing.

I knew what i was doing, i got something out of it.

I did this whilst people were not around in the small space of time i had to myself.

But i knew i did wrong. This was the only case where i acted out anything to that nature, i learned from it because what would come from it was pure guilt, taking another life, this is where i felt truly horrified with myself, nobody knows about it though even to this day.

&amp;#x200B;

I was a trouble maker, i had no way of fitting in so i found ways that seemed at least surface level to work, i was free to go out and socialize, but i was incredibly destructive.

Throwing bricks at moving cars, throwing filled lemonade bottles at cars, setting explosives on fire and watching them explode (Gas refills for lighters, deodorant etc)

But i had learned how to hide almost all traces of anything i did, i never got away with most of what i did, but i was learning, i was becoming masterful.

&amp;#x200B;

My school years were in high school at this point, however i was egotistical in my first year, other kids saw through me, i would say i am known as ""Tyson""  or some other out of whack thing, until it came to actually needing to fight another, i lost all courage, i don't know why, i just could not fight back, it was not through inability, but this tremendous fear.

So i got beat in school for a while too.

&amp;#x200B;

However, after my first year and moving to another foster home (my last carer said to me, please behave for this carer, she is new, and i will miss you so much) i took it to heart, i changed instantly, but not realizing i was burying my true self.

&amp;#x200B;

From then on, i was the child who stayed in his bedroom mostly, playing video games, listening to music, doing what a teenager does. If anything it was excellent for me, i needed my own space.

&amp;#x200B;

This new carer had her own family (her sisters 3 children) 

I was still getting bullied at school, i was growing too, i was very skinny, i just could not eat enough, no mass &amp; looked really weak.

&amp;#x200B;

There was 1 time that i sat with 2 other ""friends"" and a group of 3 boys would stand above me behind me and pull my sweater back and drop ash from their cigarettes down my back and spat on me.

&amp;#x200B;

There was another time i was in class with the support teacher, and this boy next to me called my mother some abusive words.. i instantly punched him in the eye, it was the only time in school i hit back and he had a massive black eye and was balling his eyes out on the floor.

Of course i never got away with it.

&amp;#x200B;

At the age of 14 or 15, my carer had 2 pups (collies) beautiful they were, i went with her to pick them up from the farm.

However at one point she had bought a cage for them both whilst she was out of the house, sadly the cage would turn out very dangerous, and i was well trusted with her to be left alone in the house.

The one caught his paw on the metal cage and had ripped up his paw, it bled everywhere, and the young dog frenzied running all over the place and whelping loudly.

&amp;#x200B;

I did what i thought i knew best, i calmed him, stroked him and held his paw tightly to help stop him losing any more blood. I had no phone number for my carer so i rang up the nearest person who had it, pup made a fast recovery and i was commended verbally for my fast reactions.

&amp;#x200B;

Roll on to age 16, left school. I start working for no money helping the elderly, gardening, building fences, laying flag stones, strimming lawns.. i enjoyed it. However one lunch break me and my work friend would visit some shops, and in one i bought a toy BB gun (i had never really played like a child) and he thought nothing of it, and i was just in my own element, firing some plastic BB's, he had a go too, wafting this toy gun like i was some bad ass.  Well, got back in the van to eat the food i had bought.

&amp;#x200B;

3 cop cars and a van turned up, all armed with weapons and an attack dog.

According to the police they were searching for a weapon, logically the only person with anything that resembled a weapon was me. So i just got out of the van and gave the toy to the officer who broke it into bits instead of returning it to me.

I was removed from this work placement.

&amp;#x200B;

Carer was not impressed and i had all my stuff removed from my bedroom as punishment for 2 months.

&amp;#x200B;

I would eventually turn 18 and have no choice but to leave care. On the prior build to this moment, i was put in a state of panic internally, i had no idea what to do, i was not ready to leave, (from my further understanding now) internally i was still a young boy and not grown up.

&amp;#x200B;

So i looked at something that could sustain me.. and adverts for the Army were on TV a lot, mentioning about how you have an accommodation, you can travel the world, selling me this fantasy. So i would apply.

I then went into shared accommodation meanwhile until my date to go in was finally upon me.

I was with a young lad, about my own age if not a little older.

He stole from me, what he stole was money for my birthday which was from my carers aunt who i adored and i classed them all as family.

My reaction was not for myself but to honor them. I destroyed everything he owned, i spent around 5-6 hours in a psychotic blind rage destroying everything with my bare hands, computer, TV, everything.

&amp;#x200B;

He came home looking a little pale and silent. From my recollection i stood there with bust up bloodied fists, i said calmly, this is what happens when you steal from me.

&amp;#x200B;

I would then be moved with another person. This time a alcoholic 44 year old.

He was alright at first, i had issues with washing dishes after myself so got onto me about it a bit, i did do it though.

One evening, i was playing some Dreamcast in the corner of the main room quietly and he came home late, this would be around 11:30PM with some woman i had never seen before. He had a belly full of booze, overconfident and untouchable. He told her to go upstairs because he is going to shag her lights out, she said fuck off and sat on the sofa instead.

&amp;#x200B;

He punched the mirror off the wall, i had nothing on my feet but walked to the stairs (they were situated inside the same room) I said you need to clean that up, so he found the dust pan and brush to sort it out whilst i sat on the stairs.

For some reason he made me his target though, came over casually, then put his hand around my throat, and instead of cowering i got up on my feet and unloaded into him, he did not feel anything because he was so boozed up. I wasted my energy on him and he managed to back me up against the wall, he did nothing, i don't know if he realized i had done some damage to him or not, but he let me go.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to my room, and all i had in my head was visions of him tearing my door down and smashing me up with his nunchaku, they were real and dangerous. So i slept funny that night, but eventually the next day arrived, said hello to him and asked if he was alright. Black and blue face and hung over.. looked like he had a right night, not sure if he even knew what happened, but he was taken away from me and put with someone who is known to be really rough so i have no idea what happened to him.

Another lad was moved with me, all he ever did was go out and chill when he was in and smoke weed.

&amp;#x200B;

My time to go arrived and i left him my TV, my Dreamcast and all the games and whatever stuff was in my room.

&amp;#x200B;

I was not physically built for what i was about to go into, nor was i mentally prepared.

I passed basic training and passed out a fully trained soldier, i wanted my carer to be there, she never arrived, so i passed out as the only soldier with no family to see it. Training was difficult and i struggled, but i still had an ego problem, i originally signed up for 32 regiment which was UAV. I then got an ear of 7th Parachute Regiment and how people looked at those guys as gods. I made the distinct decision to join that regiment instead.

&amp;#x200B;

I eventually passed my license to drive in phase 2 training first time. Things were not easy in phase 2 things i bought when we had time off were stolen, my ipod touch (first generation woohoo!) my nice blue jeans and my [K.Swiss](https://K.Swiss) trainers (sneakers to you US folk) 

And on the last day when i had passed phase 2, someone pissed in my issued trainers, so i instead of listening to what was best and going home in civilian clothes, wore my full uniform &amp; boots with pride. One of the females who trained there in phase 2 was on the train home, i felt embarrassed because i was in uniform and they mention about safety for soldiers with the terrorism taking place at the time, but she smiled.

&amp;#x200B;

I would then have a weeks leave and then venture into my regiment.

I spent that week with my carer who i visited. I had sneaked live ammunition from training and left it there by accident, according to my carer when i visited again later in 2015 she thought it was an ornament, until police removed it and identified it as live ammunition.

&amp;#x200B;

I headed on to my regiment, rocked up and took my stuff to where my accommodation was.

Immediately shouted to get down here and fall in with the rest, turns out my first day was punishment, i had no idea what had happened, but all i knew is that i was getting punished (blanket punishment is standard in the armed forces)

But at this point i was not questioning anything, just internally confused.

&amp;#x200B;

I expected at least a hand shake and a welcome, nothing of the sort existed, i was nothing, i had not earned a right to be there just like the other 2 new guys however.

&amp;#x200B;

So instead of earning my way, i took it to heart instead, i started then to question why i am being treated like this, what had i done wrong?

Nothing made sense, and all i saw was robotic egotistical men who seem to be really out of touch with what a fellow human is, these people were on another level mentally, perhaps it's to deal with what they had to, but it was toxic and horrendously narcissistic.

Our PTI (physical training instructor) I once could not keep up (that week off did me no good) But i did finish.

I was still this weak looking skinny 6 foot dude.

Back in accommodation i was called to see him in his room, he pinned me up against the wall and said who the fuck do you think you are? You are taking the piss. But he had a soft side, i was not fighting him back, i cowered in fear, he let go of me and told me to go back to my room.

He arrived around 10 minutes later at my room and apologized, perhaps the only time i got any respect for who i am.

I was successful in every part of training, regardless of how much it was killing me, my body was not really keeping up but my mind was relentless.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually i would get news that my real mother has cancer, and i literally broke down. Went to my commanding officer all emotional and asked about the possibility of compassionate leave, sadly we were going on tour to Afghanistan shortly.

Because i could not cope i did what i thought was best and removed myself regardless, packed up some stuff and walked out. I spent my wages on buying my mum and dad stuff, new TV, got my father a stereo, an XBOX 360, all sorts.

&amp;#x200B;

You need to know at this time i had done no inner reflecting, i had not looked into my past, i had not made sense of it all or who i am.

I was eventually found and arrested by military police and escorted back, then would be sentenced to 3 months in military prison for going AWOL. I was given a choice to continue serving or leave, i chose to leave. I served my 3 months without a single hint of a problem and i was given honorable discharge from service. I was deemed as a soldier, i was not stripped of anything.

&amp;#x200B;

In this time i had not understood the implications of what i had done, not understood who i am, that i am now supposed to be this image ""soldier""

&amp;#x200B;

My mother recovered and has never had a return of cancer, which is great.

However my father had never changed, he says one thing and does another. Still used mum as his slave.

However what my father did not realize is that i had changed, i was no longer a small boy, i had learned a thing or two through hard times. He broke a promise to my mother, he instead went out to his friends.

I destroyed his stuff (just his CD collection) scared my mother into tears, i gave her a hug and mentioned everything is fine and i'm not mad at you.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually signs of mental illness showed up in my mother, she was licking ash out of the ashtray in secret, cutting up towels and eating them...

Eventually it all took a huge toll and almost killed her, she went into hospital because she was abnormally ill, however she would have a stroke &amp; a blood clot in the brain, she had some of her brain surgically removed &amp; she has been paralyzed down one side &amp; unable to speak properly since, this is now going for 8 years now?

I was 20 years old when i had left the Army. I moved in with my real parents as i had no where else to go. I did not go to my carers, i felt nothing but shame.

I also got into computers and spent money on them, building them, took a big interest. Gaming on PC too.

I had spent time reading magazines, so i just went and did it.

&amp;#x200B;

I was playing Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 on my PC, and had got into this match and there was this lady playing. The guys were as obnoxious as you could imagine and immature. I pretended to be a female and befriended and stood up for her. she eventually added me on Steam. We got on so well, we eventually shared feelings, we also shared so much depth. She had a rough life too.

However, she would mention shortly after the reveal of how committed my feelings were to her that she was terminally ill.

We were together 3 years.

I have only 1 piece i wrote up at the time of her death. At the time i went to my father but he had nothing to say, i had no one again as i was used to.

&amp;#x200B;

I have blanked my username, i was eventually banned from [Overclockers.net](https://Overclockers.net) where i would just try to help and also share my interest in computers.

What i wrote is in the below Imgur link, i needed to say something, even if it was to strangers on the internet.

&amp;#x200B;

Since, everything has been deeply introspective, i have few friends, though those who are, i care a lot for and they are loyal, people do not question my long times of isolation, i can be in my room for months at a time, then suddenly burst out and start working.

since 2013, i have been finding myself again, fitting both sides of me together to create a whole, understanding my shadow side, understanding my good side.

I did go to the doctor for depression, however he turned me away and mentioned getting a job will fix my issues.

Here in 2019 and my gaps between jobs are becoming lesser, i am gaining will power and assertiveness again, it's taking time but i still cannot hold a job for a long time. I work hard and to excellent standard, my mind deviates though and i burn out too fast.

I live a very heavy existence.

&amp;#x200B;

My father is also disabled now, i met a woman and was with her for a year, i moved out completely and lived with her, however some challenges had arisen and i would eventually end up coming back here. I have a problem, and the only way forwards is to stand on my own two feet. So i have been trying to mentally repair myself for years, i have come a long way, i am a much different person to who i was at the age of 20, much more so any younger.

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my brother both look after our disabled parents with help of additional carer support too. I get no income unless i work or claim universal credit, i cannot stand being on universal credit so actively look for work, but with my inconsistency with work, it's getting harder.

I am beginning to see the stem of some other issues i have, like being untidy which adds on to my depression, my room is a mess, it gets to me, yet i just carry on and brush it aside like no big deal, so there is step 1, and i will be sorting it out later today, it's a bit early right now, 06:19am as of me writing this.

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing i can say personally... i am grateful for the life i have, i am grateful i was bought into this world, i have so much wrong with me, but i will never give in.

39,"I have no reason to live. I live a life of empty hedonism. Not a single woman would ever look my way because I don't make enough money, look good, or have my own place to live. I just need to kill myself and stop this empty feeling. I have people in my life who would miss me and cry (maybe 2 or 3 seriously, everyone else would get over it in a day) but it's just animal instinct and not because they would feel that something important was taken from the world. I don't know if I can wait for them to die of old age to go through with this anymore.",18Jun2019,2
40,"We dated for less than 3 years, and broke up last January. I now live very far from her. I am even seeing a new girl, but can't help myself from looking at our (ex and my) old photos/chat log/stories. I sometimes look at my ex's location on snapchat to see if she's working or home (sounds really creepy now that I've written it down)
I know it's been several months, but I still haven't thrown away anything she's given/left with me. I feel like my clock stopped when she left. 

I feel bad for this girl I'm seeing now because she's such a sweet person who really does care for me. Last week she jokingly (I think) told me she loved me and I straight up said ""You've only known me for 'this' long there's no way you love me. Don't say things you don't mean.""

you need to cut that chain

but at the same time you can't

it hurts to be chained

but it also hurts to even try to cut it down

and at the end

it feels like you are an empty vessel

a lonely person....who pities and hates himself

is unbearable.......like a void inside me

43,I just got a job at a deli that pays enough I guess. I enjoy the job but I feel like I could be doing more. It seems like a job I could've had in high school. I'm not in college anymore because I want to figure out what I'm doing. I'm living back at home because I can't afford to move out. I don't get privacy because I'm forced to share a room with my sister. Plus my dad and grandma don't understand the meaning of a closed door. Or how to knock. All I do is work and then work out. I have two friends in town and they are in a relationship with each other so I don't see them often.  I don't know how to meet people. There's a girl at the coffee shop I go to who I think is cute and I want to get to know her but I feel guilty whenever I want to talk to her more. I used to have friends who made me feel guilty whenever I was interested in someone. They made me believe that if a guy even expressed interest it was wrong and demeaning towards the girl. That was back in high school so now I'm entering my adult life feeling like I can't talk to girls without feeling like I'm doing something wrong. Like I'm somehow disrespecting them. And not even in a flirty way. I usually won't talk to someone at all if I'm interested in them. So dating is out of the question. I honestly don't know what to do with my life right now,18Jun2019,2
44,"i was never conventionally attractive and i was bullied a lot when i was younger for being ugly, but i'm okay with that now in this point in my life.  there are things i do like about myself when i look in the mirror, even though i am not what most people would consider to be pretty.

i am not the most feminine person - i usually dress in pants/jeans and a shirt, i don't do makeup but i'm into skincare, and i don't do fancy things with my hair (i have long thick wavy hair which looks nice, but it can get frizzy at times).  my boyfriend knew this about me when he first met me, and he seemed to be okay with it all.  

he has been getting more into working out and fashion - i feel it is great that he is doing something for himself that makes him happy.  i was attracted to him from day 1 all the way up until now.  

however, for the past year or so he has been requesting i work out more (i am 10 pounds heavier than usual due to always sitting in a chair at work, but i'm gradually working down to my regular size 4), wear eye makeup, wear more dresses, have nicer hair, etc.

we took a trip to new york this past weekend and met up with his friend (they used to date briefly a long time ago).  i think she was also used to seeing my bf typically dating super hot, skinny, model-like women.  she was nice, but made some comments about how i should come up with something better/more stylish to do with my hair, that i should fix my frizzy hair, that i should dress up more, and that i should get more toned.

i laughed it off, but it stung on the inside.  when my bf and i were walking back to the subway afterwards, he apologized to me on her behalf, and said that he loved me despite my ugly clothes anyways.

i guess i just wanted a place to admit that this sorta hurts.  i thought i was above it all/being emotional over something so stupid, but i guess i am just human.",18Jun2019,0
45,"Hi there! So I’m a bit of a neet, suffer from depression/anxiety/insomnia, have no real life skills or work experience. 
The past 8 months I’ve been a volunteer moderator for a game dev in their discord server, I completely went out my comfort zone, have spoken with thousands of people, helped fix bugged saves and even held community events! But very recently, after all my hard work and effort I put in pushing myself to do more and more stuff for this developer, I’ve been picked up as his community manager!!
I work in a team of professional game devs and I’m just a 21 year old neet who moderated his server, it’s pretty surreal but I’m very proud of myself for it! It’s all paid and stuff too, so I get to be in the comfort of my own home and work with a whole lot of amazing people! It’s a dream come true

46,"I got my license about a year ago. I didn’t have enough money to pay for insurance and a car, so I saved up my money (while still going to school). The cost of insurance has gone down a little bit since i’ve never had an accident. Recently, I bought myself a cheap honda civic. However, i bought from a private dealer and he screwed me over. He deleted code from the computer, so it wouldn’t show any check engine lights on the dash. Now, the car is falling apart and I really don’t know what to do. I feel so stupid. I shouldn’t have bought the car. 

Everything in my life is crumbling. The car is materialistic and isn’t the worst thing. My grandma is having some serious health issues.
She is amazing. I wouldn’t know what to do without her. I’ve haven’t been close to my friends. I have no one that understands me. That’s probably my fault. If someone gets close to me, i push them away, because everyone else has been fake. 

People tell me that I feel no emotions. I’m not a robot. They can’t tell, when i’m excited or sad. The only emotions I feel right now are negative. That’s it. I just want to curl up and shrivel away. I want to just walk out the door and live a different life.

I feel like life is not fair. I don’t do illegal things like every other teen does. I don’t vape or drink. I focus on my school work and that’s it. What did I do to deserve this? I don’t understand. Why me? Why is life so cruel? 

I quit playing basketball, because when I played it, I just felt empty inside and the team just wasn’t close. That was one of the only things that made me happy, but it just makes me feel worse now.

My life is not over, but it really does feel like i’m in a hole that just gets deeper. Life just sucks. Really sucks.",18Jun2019,1

48,"Sorry if this is a ramble and an obnoxiously long post, I just need to let it out I think. 

I have been stalked, harassed, and been threatened by three separate men. My house was vandalized one summer three separate times (once with dead fish on the porch, again with flour all over my lawn, and lastly with buckets of fish guts poured on my steps.) I never learned who vandalized my house. 

-The first started when I was 13. An 18 year old guy said he liked me, and my naive preteen self thought nothing of it. After some harmful things he did, I realized I needed to stop speaking to him. He did not like that. For the first year or two, he would create lots of new phone numbers to text or call me. He threatened to burn my house down and hurt my family. He harassed me until I was 16 or 17. 
I’m 22 now. Last week out of nowhere, he followed an Instagram I use for selling clothes. My name isn’t even on it, weird, so I blocked him. Then I received a message request from an empty Facebook, and from the name I could tell it was him. Just some weird unsettling ramblings, but I blocked that account too. I’m a bit disturbed he is bothering me after this long.

- The second man to threaten me and harass me is an ex boyfriend. We dared collectively for almost 2 years once I had graduated high school. The first year, it was just a general toxic relationship I felt stuck in. The second year, he began destroying things, beating himself bloody, and harming me. It took him threatening to murder me for me to finally reach out for help and leave him. 

- The third is a 32 year old man who bothered my friends and I. This was one year ago, and the year prior to that. He was “in love with me,” and after months of rejecting him and blocking him, he threatened to rape me and hurt me. He would make new numbers and accounts and even paid my ex to give him my address (which was a number off.) He left me alone finally when my current boyfriend moved in with me, and spoke to him directly telling him to leave me alone before he gets charged. Haven’t heard from him since.


These experiences have left me extremely cautious and borderline paranoid, when leaving my home or returning home, when leaving work, when I am anywhere to be honest. But as time has passed, the paranoia has dwindled down. 


Tonight, I think I had some sort of episode. Full blown panic mode. All because my dog barked for longer than usual. Now I am scared that my paranoia is back.

My dog sleeps downstairs on our couch by the front windows/front door. Our room is upstairs. My boyfriend was asleep, and I was awake on my laptop. My dog began barking every minute or so, but kept doing it for 20+ minutes. I kept peeking out the window but saw nothing, and he kept barking. I began to get nervous as he never barks that way, even at animals outside. So I woke my boyfriend up and apologized, asked him if he could go downstairs with me to check things out. We looked outside, checked the door, and saw nothing. (My dog still seemed wound up.) boyfriend went back upstairs, and I grabbed a drink. As I came upstairs and turned into the hall, I swear I heard “shhhh shhhh” and footsteps, (probably just paranoia idk), and screamed and bolted into our room, jolting my boyfriend awake. 

After that I violently shook and cried for like 20 minutes and apologized for freaking him out, and asked him to go lock our bedroom door bc I couldn’t even stand up.  Calmed down, he’s asleep now, and my dog hasn’t barked since. 

So ye I’m just venting I guess. Guess it’s back to peeping out my window every night. 

(Some of my current jumpiness may also be attributed to a shooting that happened at my work in the fall. It was a scarring situation for me, and since then loud bang like noises set me off. ex: one night our tall mirror crashed on the floor and I woke up screaming and flailing. Can I catch a break pls o pls)

49,"My highschool girlfriend lasted into college for a year or two, but since then I've been single for a while (still in college).

I want to make a tinder account and hopefully start a relationship, but I don't have any pictures that I'm happy with. I was a little overweight for a while but then I lost all the weight and am now almost skinny. All somewhat recent pictures of me show a very fat version of me, and I don't want to use them.

I want to take new photos for tinder, but I don't know what I should be doing in them. I'm sort of in love with my car and I need at least one or two picture of me standing with it or working on it or something, but what should I do with the rest of the pictures? I want maybe around 6, and I think my main picture should be like a slightly more close up portrait. I live halfway between Boulder Colorado and Denver Colorado if that gives anyone any ideas for me-- but also I don't want to take too many naturey photos and to give off the vibe that I enjoy hiking or something...

50,"I don't know if I'm depressed or not. Not sure anyone cares. Sure, it's said a lot, but people have their own lives. I don't blame anyone. And I know I don't think exactly like everyone else. Which, is a fallacy to assume a typical rationale of thought. Guess that's the rub, isn't it?: alone in a crowd. Suppose we all are.

I guess it was two years ago that my head broke. I used to be depressed, often. Suicide was a daily thought for years. Too many years of abuse, mostly from myself. Post-traumatic stress disorder is hard to explain. It's a hole in your life, vacuous and consuming. I think most people try to ignore it, or fill that space with material pursuits, and attach themselves with others comorbidly. Me? I jumped into that hole, headlong. In self-destruction, I could reclaim my control, and laugh at the void. In time, I suppose I identified as that void. Sexual pursuits, more drugs than I should have survived - I reveled in my lack of control, and the twisted hands of fate. I suppose you could call it cynical nihilism: finding control through understanding that there was no control - that the universe was unfeeling, unmotivated, and ultimately, our place within it is insignificant to eternity. Not that that mindset has changed.

When the chaos began to grow old, I settled into feeling like an outsider. I've lived too many lifetimes, and done far too much. There was no exploit left - no more limits to hurl myself over. I had long stopped fearing death, but I suppose I still feared life: the ever expiring ticking of the clock. Photos in hallways, stained with age and unnoticed; lives lost, mourned for a moment and lost forever; a casket lined with a thousand useless paystubs and empty yesterdays. I found myself without direction, and slowly, that hole began to take over.

I wanted to die. I had tried before, long ago. I don't know if it's better or not to have survived; you can never unknow that in that moment, you had the potential, and saw the motion through. Even with a jammed pistol, and the longest, most surreal moment when it comes to pass, I knew I had managed to pull the trigger. It's a weird feeling, to say the least. As it crept up on me again, I knew what I wanted - or perhaps, what I no longer wanted. But, a part of me knew that death was nothing. Sweet, empty nothing, but nothing natheless. Death isn't a transition, but a threshold: the dead do not envy the living, for there is nothing beyond that door. I had seen death many times, and had come to know it well - not as poetic, but as stark and cold.

But, part of me snapped. I can't describe it; a shock through my being, louder than any thought and brighter than any light. And I realized, if I could choose to die at any moment, then it was always an option. With that in mind, I realized then that life was meaningless. Not in a negative sense, but in a way more vast and more intense than anything I could express. The universe isn't for us; we're accidents in some nth iteration of eternity, ultimately doomed to the collapse of all things. But that means, there's no limitation either. If it was your last day alive, what would you do? For me, it was. But so was tomorrow, and the next. With no reason, there is no restriction. I'm sure many fantasize violence, but I suppose that was never in me. I've been spending the last few years doing what I can for others. Material is only a burden to carry, so it wasn't much to uproot myself. I was homeless for a while, though if I'm honest, it was my own decision. I find myself now states away from where I started, dragging people thaf I know could be more if given the chance out of the situation an uncaring universe placed them in. And while you would think this would give me some kind of joy, I suppose that brings us back to why I'm here. I guess I haven't felt much of anything in all that time. I'm no longer depressed, and I'm far from suicidal, but I also see no point to living. Death is a threshold: I prefer life because it is what I know, but from the side of death, it's irrelevant. I stopped fearing life, and while the doors opened, the mysticism of uncertainty and aspiration died. The man behind the curtain was just a mirror, and I've realized what that truly means.

I'm not depressed, but I guess I don't feel anything. I'm not sure if I should. I chose to die, and I did: I let the part of me that no longer wanted to live slip away into the void, and I was left with the shell. I don't know if I regret that decision; I guess I'm not even sure if I feel regret anymore. But as things move forward, and I find myself in an endless stream of isolation, I guess I find it more difficult to justify my continued being. I don't have any intention of dying, but I guess it doesn't really matter to me. I want for nothing, but is that life? I suppose, it doesn't really matter to me. Purpose has a place in humanity, and now, I guess I'm just an observer - some living ghost on the edge of existence. And in the end - long after my passing - memory will fade, and I will be as insignificant to this world as we all are to eternity. I don't mind.

I'm not sure if I'm crazy. Other people seem to think I am. But, I see their machinations, and the cycles they call ""comfort"", and I don't envy it. But, I'm not sure I can feel envy anymore. I don't know what exactly happened in my head. Maybe this is the state of Buddha, without the spirit or discipline. Maybe this is what Jesus felt, and designated purpose to continue on. Maybe I'm just crazy.

I don't know what it matters in posting this. Ultimately, it doesn't, but nothing does. For now, I guess I'll continue to be a ghost with nowhere to go and nothing to do. I guess I'll see what good I can do along the way.",18Jun2019,1

53,"This took me a long to realize, and I’m just realizing it today at 3 A.M. 

I remember when I was young. Everyone in my class was my friend, I had no trouble at all talking and making friends. Somehow, when I turned 15 I seemed to loose that. I remember my Birthday that I was out of it. I blamed the steak for making me sick, but I now realize it was something else. A mark that I’ve changed, and for the worst. 

I didn’t develop well socially. I seemed to always be behind everyone. I wasn’t too far off, but now I can’t be social at all. I always fuck everything up, and I always cause an awkward situation. I became very shy, and really reclusive. 

I later joined my church’s tech team for the student service. I was 15 or so when I did. I was shy, and barely talked to anyone. I soon grew to like everyone on that team, and I wanted to be their friend. A lot of them seemed to like me also. We would sometimes talk, and that lead to horrible things. I kinda realized, though I just made a joke out of it and visualized it as a meme, that every time I got out of my shell and tried to interact with people I’m comfortable with things go to shit.

Well, later on I got into the worst fucking situation ever. There was this girl who’s BF I found extremely terrifying. He isn’t a big muscular dude, he’s  pretty scrawny. Yet my lips would start twitching every time he messed with me (he would just talk and joke around. I actually like it though. For some reason...). Well, his gf was tired of me saying sorry (I use that word a lot) and threatened me. I said it again, WHEN I SHOULD OF BECAUSE IT WOULD OF BEEN RUDE NOT TO, and she followed through. Right in front of her bf and some other people. What did she do? You say. Licked me on my neck. WTF!!!!!! Infront of her fucking bf!!!! Nothing happened afterwards. Though she didn’t want to talk about it. I remember someone telling me they reminded her at school, and she got pissed. 

Well, I remember later I’m helping out at big church, and she comes up to me. “Hey, I regret licking you on the neck.” I regret, like it would of been fucking ok to like anyone else on the neck. She fucking regretted licking me on the neck. WTF, am I that much of a looser? She would of been ok if she licked someone else’s neck. Why though? Because everyone views me as a creep.

Yep, a fucking creep. How? Cause of good old anxiety. Apparently nervousness=creepiness. Leaning against a wall looking at a fucking guitar is also creepy too. TF? 

Anyways, we’re coming to the part where I started realizing everything. I realized I had no friends. This was cause it was summer (my church stopped all student ministry programs which was how I socialized), and I had no chance to go out and socialize. This made me want to make friends with different people: my crush, the girl who licked me, her BF, a drummer, and a girl on my team. Well, after summer ended and I was back. I was trying to talk to people more. But then they stopped talking to me, and had no interest in me. I was too fucking slow to become their friends. They were trying to befriend me, but I was a fucking idiot and ruined it. But that’s not all folks!!! Soon the girl who licked me and BF were basically on and off about caring that I exist. I would talk to them, and they would talk to me too. But then their whole attitude towards me would change and they’d give no fucks about me.

This made me want to be their friend more. I already had some true friends, but I wanted them to be my friends. In turn, I fucking ruined those friendships. And for what now? To realize I can’t have friends? Now I only have one friend, probably because we’re in a band together (just me and him though, I don’t know anyone who would want to join, especially with me). I still follow these people on Instagram, I follow my crush, the girl who licked me (her BF has me blocked on Instagram, he didn’t know who I was when he blocked me but he might now and kept come block.), and the drummer. There’s another girl who I wanted to be friends with but I don’t care anymore. Until today, I wanted to be their friends. Now I’m thinking about deleting my Instagram account and going under a new alias. That would be a lot for me to do though for reasons I don’t want to get into. 

Thanks for letting me vent. I feel a little better. But now I don’t know what to do? I can’t have friends, and it only leads to horrible things, but I can’t stop wanting to be their friend. What do I do? Do I cut every connection? I still want to serve on the worship team on my church though. Is it really worth it to just not serve anymore?  I really want to though.",18Jun2019,0
54,"Tldr; connected or identical dreams with another person. Has anyone else experienced this?


When I was with my, now, ex bf for years we would commonly (maybe twice a month, if not more often) have these bizarre connected/intertwined dreams. Our dreams would either be exactly the same, down to every detail, and we were both in it doing and saying the same things. or some times where, say mine, left off, his would pick up there and continue with the same story and setting and people.. 
The most recent one happened last December. We had already been broken up for about 6 months and hadn't been speaking. I had a dream that him and I were in a house we owned together (the last year we were together we were looking at houses for sale and trying to buy one.) I woke up and reached for my phone and the first thing I see is messages from him. I hadn't heard from him in roughly 6 months. He was telling me about this dream he had where he was leaving this house we had together and I was standing in the doorway as at he was riding off on his Harley.
I was just thinking about that.. I've never had that kinda dream connection with anyone before or after him and wondered if anyone has experienced this?",18Jun2019,2
55,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

This account is a throwaway.

Today I found out a friend of mine attempted suicide and is now hospitalized. We're in late secondary school and it's well known in our friend group that he's been struggling with mental health over the past year and a half, and over the past few months he has barely been coming to school. He has good support from his mother. I've heard that he's in an OK physical state as of now, but I am very troubled by this.

I guess it's been in the back of my mind that something like this could happen, but I never thought it would actually happen till it did. Mostly I'm posting because I am totally unsure how to deal with this situation, and I'm confused as to where to go from here and how to be with him from now on, or what advice I can possibly give him.

Well, today, for free, I am going to teach you how to find your soul mate on dating apps. I do mean free, there is no class to sign up with advanced techniques, I am not selling a book (yet XD), and you don't have to listen to my webinar.  Three simple steps. All I need is five minutes of your attention. Be Honest, you've spent more than that swiping today.  I promise to show you how to find a genuine connection.


Step 1


Remember how I asked if you were afraid to be alone?  Well, that's not enough.  In order to find your soul-mate, you need to be downright terrified of it.  The fear of being alone needs to be so present in your life that you unconsciously make decisions based on it.  Doing things like ""obsessively reading articles that promise to show you how to find a genuine connection"", ""feeling an impulse to close said articles when the information hits too close to home"", or ""being unable to remember the last time you went to the movies, shopping, or dinner alone"" are all pretty good indicators. Some would say this fear is unhelpful and might even be potentially damaging in a relationship. Not with your soul-mate.  The fear is what starts you looking in the first place!  It helps you overlook your soul-mates minor personality quirks such as ""having no opinion on anything,"" ""having an opinion on everything,"" or being ""eerie similarity to your last 3 dates"". Without this fear, you might begin to think about and be intentional in your search for a partner. As you will see in Step 3, this is a grave error to make. 

Step One is, ""Be Terrified of Being Alone. ""

Step 2


To find your perfect opposite who will help you solve all your problems, bring you happiness, and love you like you have never loved yourself.  You have to believe that you are unloveable.  If you've ever thought ""I'm not *insert physical/emotional characteristic* enough,"" ""There must be something wrong with me,"" or ""I wish I could find someone who would just accept me as I am"" you are halfway there. When you believe that, not only are these thoughts an accurate representation of yourself not at all distorted by childhood trauma and social conditioning, but they are also the reason that you are single you will have created a context where implicitly you are undeserving of Love.  This will generate a chasm of emotional pain deep within you. An abyss that will be filled by the ""basic human decency,"" shown by your soul-mate.  Without this reference point, your soul-mates behaviors would come off as things any reasonable person would do to show even a passing interest in another.

Step Two is ""Believe That You Are Unloveable""

Step 3


Equipped with a debilitating fear of loneliness and an unshakeable belief that you are unloveable, you are now ready to begin the process of finding your soul-mate. Finding a soul-mate isn't something that involves logical consideration, conscious intention, or a discussion about your expectations, needs, and wants in a relationship.  It is about only your feelings.  Relying on your feelings assists you in unconsciously seeking partners that allow you to replay dysfunctional familiar childhood patterns. You swiping habits need to reflect this unconscious desire. Swiping behaviors that increase the possibility of matching with your soul-mate include, but are not limited to: ""Swiping right on people you think are more attractive than you and that you would be lucky to go on a date with"", ""Ignoring bio's"", ""drunk swiping"", and ""paying for Tinder Gold"". Engaging in all these behaviors at once significantly increases your chance at a genuine connection.

Step Three is ""Swipe Based On an Unconscious Desire to Replay Familial Patterns""

And That's it. I don't mean to bring logic into it and mathematically speaking someone is going to swipe right on you, especially when so many are following their own soul-mate plan. When you do meet them, limerance and habitual patterns of interaction will do the rest. Imagine it. You will both meet up for your first date and be taken aback by just how gorgeous each other is and how lucky you are to be on a date with them.   You will both do the usual small talk, and because you both like to overshare, to quell the emotional chasm, you will slip-up and say insecurity you have about yourself. ""I feel like I look like terrible,"" ""I always say something stupid"" To which one of you will respond, ""You look great,"" ""I think you're funny."" You will feel an instant connection. Chemistry.  As you continue this dance of sharing insecurities and validating each other you will notice that it seems time has stopped, your heart will be racing, you will be flooded so many emotions, you will think so many thoughts but underlying them is this ""Here is someone who finally accepts me in a way I don't accept myself"". That's when you know you've found them. Your Soul-mate. The conversation will be amazing, the sex will be amazing, the relationship will be so perfect that you never even have to talk about it.    

""Well Derrick, I feel like I have been through that before and the relationship didn't end well.  What did I do wrong?.""

I followed this plan flawlessly, even before dating apps. I met my soul-mate in an abnormal psychology class.  It wasn't just some objectively arbitrary, statistically likely, and routine situation to meet someone that I gave more significance because it was tangentially related to my degree.  It was fate. We were married for eight years, four of which I think we both experienced something which could be called circumstantial happiness, which because of our shared fear of being alone, was better than actually being alone.  Over time, it became apparent that we weren't able to just anticipate each other's needs.   For us to solve our problems, we would actually need to talk. Something that seemed strange for people who married each other a year after we met because ""we just knew what each other was thinking"".  We had this beautiful dance of pursuing and withdrawing. It was based on our shared fear of being unloveable. We each took turns pushing each other away because we both felt each other would leave first. When one of us thought the other emotionally withdrawing, the other began emotionally pursuing in an endless self-reinforcing cycle. This may happen sometimes, and it doesn't mean that you need to completely re-evaluate your approach to not only the way you view relationships, but ultimately the way that you see yourself, it just means you didn't find the right one. Just remember whether its eight years or eight days, these relationships always end just as quickly as they began. Don't give up on the idea of your soul-mate, or ""The One"", or ""finding the only person in the world who knows exactly what you are thinking at this moment"", they could always just be one bathroom selfie away.",18Jun2019,0

(THey provide vouchers for interview clothes) I replied politely (I’m very quiet) ‘yes, Iv got all that' and she said 'oh have you got all that?’ (upbeat as I said) I said yes then she went on to say 'ok well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes, (she moved her hands also while saying this accordingly) make sure you get a shave, make sure you cut your nails..make sure you do your hair up all nice and that.....(then she paused as she was facing her computer) ..'and make sure you put some aftershave on aswell, for the girls make sure it's mens' then burst out laughing, she’s never even smiled before (I just smiled along with it) I a young guy and she’d in her early 30s. Just really worried she thinks I'm Ugly and that I stink. I did need a shave which maybe why but I always showered as normal and was clean I just hadn’t shaved this once and had easy wear layabout clothes on :/ she also put in the email ‘please dress smartly’ underlined.

62,"Throwaway account because shit, this is a bad one. TL;DR - My husband's best friend killed himself and I feel like all I'm doing is making it worse. How do I do little things to make things easier/better for him?

&amp;#x200B;

My husband and I have been together for six years, married for two. These two years have not been easy. At all. 

&amp;#x200B;

In December of last year, his best friend killed himself. They were like brothers. They had known each other since they were just six years old, and it felt like he knew my husband better than I did sometimes. He was supposed to be the best man at our wedding (we eloped and had the ceremony a while later after we saved money), the godfather to our future kids, etc. Losing him was the hardest thing my husband has ever had to go through. He drove back to his hometown on Christmas eve, and spent Christmas day with his best friend's family and fiancee, grieving and figuring out funeral stuff. When he came back home, he looked older, more jaded, dead inside, and scared all at once. It broke my heart.  I watched him hold his best friend's little brother in his arms as he gave a eulogy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I never knew his best friend as well as I would have liked, but I knew he was a good man. He was engaged, and his fiancee and I had spent many a day together planning their wedding. She was completely star struck and in love. And now, her heart is destroyed, and her life is in shambles. She calls my husband a few times a week to talk, and it's soul crushing to hear those conversations. She moved in with us for a few months while she found herself again, and it was a strain, but she needed it and we understood that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway. My husband wasn't coping well. All of his time was spent either working, or helping his best friend's family. His hair started graying, then falling out in the shower. He was a constant mess, or he was shutting down. He never took a break from work, from helping the family, from supporting me and my endeavors, not even from his own creative projects. The stress piled up fast, and he ended up attempting to overdose on prescription medication. He failed, and was in the hospital for two days. I was there with him from the moment I got the call. I was worried, then I was mad, then I cried a lot while he slept, then I was mad again, then I went back to being worried. His mom and I convinced him to take some time off and go to therapy. 

It was all going okay, and things were getting back to normal, when I ruined it. I had left for work, and he had a panic attack I guess, and stayed in the corner of our bedroom all day crying, shaking, and according to the neighbors, screaming. I came home and saw that none of the chores were done, the bed was unmade, and I got mad. In my anger I said ""you haven't stopped looking afraid since he died!"" I hate myself for that. I hate myself so goddamn much for saying that. I went to my mom's house that night, and left him alone. I thank God every day now that he didn't kill himself then. Instead, he started packing my things, thinking I wanted out when I didn't come back that night. 

So we went to couples counseling, something he knew a bit about, since he used to be a counselor for at-risk teens. We went to someone he said had an amazing reputation, and it helped us a lot, but we stopped going because he felt guilty. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, at that point it had been four months since we had sex, and I was horny, for the lack of a better word. I got it in my head that maybe having sex would help him? I tried initiating, which isn't our norm, and it spooked him. He caught on to what I was doing, and started apologizing, which killed the mood, and I again got mad at him, saying that we couldn't just go without sex until he got his shit together. You see the pattern here? Of me being a shit wife? So, we eventually had sex later in the week, and it was an amazing release for me, and a stressful rollercoaster for him, because he did it because he felt bad, I think.  

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I felt like nothing was working right, and I actually got mad at his dead best friend for not only ruining his own marriage, but mine, too. I felt like I was a shitty friend to his fiancee, and a shitty wife. I wanted to be better, so I went to therapy myself, to see if an outside perspective would help me improve. My husband saw the visits' co-pays on our online bills, and put two and two together. He then apologized even more, thinking that his handling of his situation had driven me to the edge. After I explained, he understood, but I could tell it still weighed on him. I stopped going to therapy after that, which kinda' sucks because I feel like I still need it, but I don't want to upset my husband, so...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry this is long, but as I write, more comes spilling out and it feels so good to write it all down. 

&amp;#x200B;

You have to understand who my husband was. He was a hilarious stand-up comedian, a compassionate teen counselor, a brilliant freelance editor, a charming customer service rep, and a gifted poet. I loved that he wore so many hats so well. I told him last night that he was all of those things that I just described to you. I wrote those exact words down for him. He took the paper and began scribbling out my adjectives, and replacing them all with ""scared."" It breaks my heart to see my husband like this, and it makes me afraid, too, because I feel like I'm losing the man he was. He used to talk to me about football, and I don't care about football, but the way he talked about it made me care enough to be interested in what he was saying. I miss that. I miss hearing about football from my husband. I just want to have the courage to ask him to play a game of Magic: the Gathering with me again. 

He's always saying to people, ""the best is yet to come,"" and I wish he could feel that in his own life again.

I had an awful childhood but through therapy I got over a lot of things and currently I have an amazing girlfriend, will finish university by the end of the month and will (according to plan) move in with my gf by the end of this year. Everything is going great but I am not happy.

I always worry about everything that happens to me. The smallest things will keep me up at night and I am done with it. Last night I was worrying about worrying too much and if I will ever be able to enjoy all the good things happening in my life. It makes me feel bad because there are so many people worse off than me and I am still miserable.

I don't know if this is the right place to post this but I need to tell someone. I worry that if I tell my gf about this that she will worry too much about me. Is there something wrong with me? Is it normal to never be truly happy in life? Anyone who felt like this that changed and can give me some advice on how to get over this?",18Jun2019,0

66,"This stuff makes me resent the idea of new friendships. I saw a picture on here of a group of friends camping, enjoying each other's company. I want that. But all I can imagine is being on that camping trip while they all gawk at their phones in silence, for the entirety of the trip.

My friend of 20+ years and I have an uncannily identical sense of humour. Whenever we hang out, we have an absolute blast. Well, we did, before he bought a smartphone six years ago. Since then, whenever we do something together he usually spends between 50-100% of the time scrolling through Facebook or tapping at the screen while ignoring everything I say. After many times expressing my annoyance at this and asking that he stop doing this when we hang out, I'd come to accept the damage to our friendship as a matter of fact and simply hung out with him less, because it was now boring.

That was, until one day he forgot his phone. It was just like the old times: Laughing; joking; having actual conversations. But no, apparently Facebook trumps that enjoyment every single time.

I've been going to college for the full academic year now, and I've seen friend groups suffering to the same degree. The worst I saw was two girls having dinner; one girl was enthusiastically sharing some story, while the other girl tapped away at her phone, completely unresponsive. The girl's enthusiasm slowly became less and less, until she stopped talking altogether and stared into the distance with a defeated look on her face, before pulling out her own phone, and that was that.

It seems to me that the smartphone is now a fact of life. Friendship as I knew it is dead. Hanging out now is simply having people physically around you while you scroll through your social media, without a word spoken.",18Jun2019,1

69,"For any one who needs some motivation or inspiration:

I'm not quite sure how to word this. 

Recently I've realized I have depression and anxiety, actually for a while now. Having gone so long without realizing really affected my social life, as well as my mental health. After college, I just had a small group of friends who were amazing and a fiance I just recently got engaged to. However. Good things do come to an end. I stopped being as social, deleted Facebook because I thought it was too addicting, never posted pictures for my friends to see, kept to myself mostly. I was happy and very comfortable like that for years, or so I thought...

I broke up with my fiance because I realized I wasn't happy, in our relationship and with my life. I needed to make changes. I was tired of feeling angry for no reason and tired of having unfinished art projects because of lack of motivation. I know I can do so much better. So that's what I'm doing.

Im using my calendar more to get more organized. I bought a journal for daily entries and sketches and ideas. I'm being way more open with my feelings and I'm being honest and upright with people! It's amazing what can happen when you just tell people how you're feeling or what you're thinking about. They'll listen. I broke out my art supplies and I'm telling myself to make a little bit of art each day. I'm getting more sunlight. The pool just opened so I'll stop by for just 10 minutes every other day. I'm searching for a job to start my career (harder than expected btw). I did download Facebook again because despite being ""addicting"", I realized I was missing out on big and small news about my family and friends.

I was just so tired of feeling down and hurting those around me for no reason. I'm trying to be more positive and that starts with being positive about myself.

To those who feel like you're stuck in a ditch with no one to help you... please try to help yourself first. I know that may sound ignorant and not every one can do that but all that matters is that you at least tried!

71,"TL;DR: Got sent to a foreign country when I was young and naive, took on a huge debt and didn't make the best of my life because my parents have shitty financial habits

I also take responsibility for shitty financial habits too. My parents have not been good with money at all. They bought a house which they couldn't afford in 2008, literally a few days after the global financial crisis hit. They couldn't keep up with the payments and just ended up selling the house a few years later.

A couple of years later, they sent me to a foreign country to do a diploma in hopes that I can land a job earning that high value currency. I did my diploma and graduated in 2013 but they never showed up for my graduation. That should have been the first sign. My parents can't even afford to see their own son graduate. I remember feeling so alone. So many parents watching their kids graduate and I'm just standing there awkwardly.

Anyway, I got a job later which I absolutely hated. I also was parallely doing a degree but the stress of work, studying and gathering university fees made me extremely depressed. I got fired from that job and went back to my home country in 2015.

This is where things went to shit. One small decision could have changed my life forever. At the time, I thought my diploma would be useless back home so I went back to that country to finish my degree. You can't get student loans issued so easy here, so they put up our house as collateral for the high fees.

Things got even worse when I went back. I was a horrible person. I was horribly depressed. I starved on many occasions and was homeless for a short while. I never managed to finish that degree either because I was just so damn depressed. I was horrible because I did things out of desperation and clawing for survival.

Anyway, I came back home for good this time. I had a massive loan on my head, no degree and no job. Things got even worse. Fast forward one year later and I'm doing a degree for the third time. I'm still doing it now but hopefully I pass this time.

But I know that my parents want to do things that they can't afford. They'll go out of their way, take loans and live a life they can't afford. I never asked about their retirement fund but at this point I won't be surprised if their retirement fund is minimal.

I have another 6-7 years before I can close the loan in full. I don't have enough money with me to save properly and foreclose before that. So my life went from being depressed, stressed and debt free to even more depressed, even more stress and a huge debt. It's not easy to do college like this.

Things could have been different if my parents didn't make piss poor financial decisions. I could have been in a ""foreign country"" much later in life if I did things the affordable way. But now I'm stuck. I know it won't last forever but I'm so tired and I feel like killing myself every single day.",18Jun2019,1

77,"First off, a little background. I've been a music student for 5 years now and just finished my Bachelor's degree in composition this week. These last weeks I've been super stressed to finish my last papers to not have to do another semester to finish the degree (I already did 1 extra year).   
I managed to finish everything and I thought the stress would go down and I would feel more at ease and less tense and enjoy my life more. Right now though, the only thing I can think about is how I'm gonna manage to create great music, It's all I think about and it stresses me the fuck out. I'm angry when having to relate to anything else (for instance if a friend calls me and asks me to hang out), the only thing I want to be doing is to sit at home and create/compose music on my computer. This would be great if I enjoyed it, but it makes me really stressed out, angry, anxious and restless. For the most part, I'm just like paralyzed, not able to write anything, angry because I'm not able to create anything good, and I sit there just going over and over inside my head how I'm going to create something good.  


I'm now seeing a therapist and last time we met we started talking about why I have this crazy drive to do something great, 'cause it's been with me all my life. I've always focused like super hard on one thing, wanting to be really great at it, but now it has come to the point where I'm not able to function very well socially ('cause I feel angry when I have to stop thinking about music, and as a result I'm so disconnected from everything else), and I'm not even able to create any good music; for the most part I'm just sitting there frustrated and the process is just painful and I'm not able to enjoy creating at all. I think I do want to enjoy creating though, being swept along the process and taking that journey of discovering along the creative process, but as of now it stresses me the fuck out and ruins other areas of my life.   


So, does anybody have anything to say about this? Maybe you've been through something similar? I really want to move beyond this crazy drive/obsession/major pressure that I'm putting on myself, and let more go of it so I can relax and enjoy my life and relationships with people and the actual creative process, but I'm kind of at loss at how to do so. It seems I'm either in this huge stress, or really depressed and apathetic to avoid having to relate to the stress.

Growing up I knew I was vastly different from my siblings. They’re all about school and doing what is necessary to keep our strict African parents happy, even if that means sacrificing our own desires.

I don’t want to live for my parents approval but I also don’t want to let them down either. If I told my parents that college isn’t for me I’d most likely be disowned...but that’s just how the story goes, I guess. 

Music is my calling. Singing is my calling. I feel it so deeply in the fibers of my being. I would be so heartbroken if I’m 50 and lamenting on times like this because I didn’t follow my purpose. 

I have no idea what to do.",18Jun2019,19

82,"Is there a term for someone who is involuntarily friendless? Like an ‘incel, but he/she just has trouble making and keeping friends? 

I’ll begin by laying out my backstory: I’ve never been able to form/attract/keep true, deep friendships. I am unlikeable, although I am described as attractive and friendly.

The thing is - I think this is with good reason. I’m not nice. I don’t take ribbing in stride and I take myself too seriously. I’m a sore loser. But I constantly judge people on their intelligence, social status and attractiveness. I feel a little glad whenever someone slips up, so I don’t feel so bad about myself. I’m always comparing myself to others, and need to be the center of attention. 

I was also not kind to my first boyfriend. I was needy and insecure, and would frequently accuse him of cheating on me (i’ve never cheated). I would get angry when he didn’t text me back immediately and jump to conclusions. I was also manipulative.

I’m just not sure if this is depression, low self-esteem or a personality disorder. Or all of the above. I don’t feel fulfilled or emotionally connected, and it’s killing me. I really want to build healthy connections with people, but my personality is terrible.",18Jun2019,1

85,"My dad's ex girlfriend and her son came into my work yesterday (I work at a movie theater) and chatted with me and my boyfriend for a bit to touch base. They've both been very close to me and even if her and my dad are separated, all of us are friends and get along well like family. We rarely see each other or talk because that's just how life goes sometimes, but it's always nice to see them.

I have two cats that live with her because they were born in my old home next door to her and I wasn't able to bring them with me when I moved about. One is Rikku, the runt of the litter that we kept as we adopted all the other kitties out. The other is her brother, Sephie. Initially he was adopted out to an older lady, but after about a week she said she was unable to care for him properly so we went and picked him back up. Since then, he and I grew very close and he's been the best cat I've ever had and known.

We used to play and he'd come with me on walks. When I used to exercise by running up and down the stairs, he would run with me. He always laid under the blankets with me and went to sleep with me for a while when I would go to bed. He has one of the best personalities I've ever seen in a cat and is very smart. I absolutely love my little Sephie.

Anyway, before they left, her son told me that he doesn't know how much longer Sephie has. He and Rikku are about 15 or 16 years old so they're at about average cat span. When hearing this, my boyfriend told me that his heart sunk because he knows how much I love Sephie. He told me that he would take me out to visit them on Friday. I'm both excited and nervous about the visit. I just wanna take this, very likely, last opportunity to see my little buddy before he passes.",18Jun2019,1
86,"I am female, mid thirties. I was in love. It happened over a year ago. I fell in love without knowing he had a girlfriend but knowing that he didn't love me. I found out. I was heartbroken. But we stayed friends. 
Anyway. He was at my place once. My aunt had died and I had been upset and called him out on being a bad friend bc he hadn't cared. He came over. We listened to music and just talked and when I got up to get something to drink, he pulled me down and kissed me and didn't stop.

See, I was never loved. I had never been kissed by someone who loved me. I was in relationships before but they were abusive and exploitive and I have no good memory of being kissed by someone who just wanted to kiss me, just that. Not hurt me after.

And it felt good. And it felt horrible. And so I turned it sexual real quick. I knew he didn't find me attractive and I don't know how to take the lead in bed anyway. It was never allowed.
And he grew soft and it was awkward and degrading. And it broke the moment. I needed that to happen.

Because I couldn't have that moment be a stolen moment. If my only memory of a good kiss would be that, how could I ever forgive me?

87,"Art is probably the only thing I’m ‘naturally’ good at. I spent a lot of time in elementary school and high school working on it (including doing a giant mural in my high school that is one of the things I’m most proud of). But I never pursued it in any way - I studied neuroscience at university, and now I’m doing the same thing for my Masters. 

I always felt like I had so many reasons to put my passion for art and painting aside: not enough time, not really a super productive hobby, expensive for good supplies, maybe not ‘good enough’, and “if I have time to paint, I have time to study”. 

Yesterday, I went out to a nice art supply store and I spoke with the lovely people working there to help me pick out the things I was interested in. I got good oil paints and brushes and a canvas and stuff to elongate my use of the oil. 

Then, I sat in my backyard and I spent two hours starting to paint a picture of my long-distance boyfriend and I that I’ll surprise him with when I visit in 18 days. 

As much as I’m passionate for neuroscience and my career, I am so excited to be doing something that I forgot I loved. I feel like I’m starting to go back to what really matters to me. The first step is always the hardest.",18Jun2019,4
89,"Growing up, I never thought I’d be so alone. You see, I was the child that had a close knit immediate family. Sure, we didn’t get along very well, we never talked about our problems, we’d argue constantly, but like it was normal for us. Growing up my eldest brother and I were super close. Being homeless kids was tough, but we always had each other. Then trying to adjust to having an actual home, but being dirt poor was probably even tougher. But we stuck through it. My little brother was always the rat, the parents little spy, the favorite angle child and the complete opposite of me and my other brother. But we took care of him like we were his parents. He almost never left our side. My parents were low life’s to put it nicely, they made each other miserable, dad was an alcoholic mom was a meth head, they both got sober, but decided that working wasn’t for them. We lived off the Mormon church and the state. But despite all of that  they were always there for parent teacher conference, to vent if you had a bad day, every birthday, they may not have been responsible parents, but they were always there. Then you have my grandparents who were truckers, but lived with us when they weren’t on the road. They also helped with bills and food without them there is no doubt we would have been homeless for our whole lives instead of half of it. But they were angry, irritable, and over all just fed up with everything.  But again, they were always there. All of us spent at least 1-3 hours most days together in the same room. It felt like home. 

I also was the child that had a lot of friends. I was always out doing something with someone. Meeting new people. Talking to everyone. I was a goddamn social butterfly and I loved it. I loved having friends in every group at school. I loved giving advice and being the shoulder people needed. At any given time during the day I was talking to 4+ people either by text, or on the phone, computer, or hanging out. I was always talking to my friends. I made such strong bonds I didn’t think they would ever break. And I was confident that if I ever lost a friend for whatever reason I would have no problem finding friends. It came so naturally to me. 

And now here I am 26 years old. I don’t have any friends. When I say that I mean it literally. I do not have 1 single person that isn’t family that I talk to that’s not just small talk. I have work acquaintances that I talk to about the weather and work and plans to redo my backyard. But I don’t have anyone I can talk to about my problems, thoughts, fears, ambitions that isn’t family (or my fiancé) I should note that my fiancé is amazing and I can talk to her about a lot. But not everything. There’s just some things you can’t vent to your S.O about (you know like things your S.O doing). I don’t have a single friend and I never in my life thought that would happen. I mean, it my fault. I’ve cut out some toxic people and I don’t regret that. But then I’ve also stopped putting effort into maintaining friendships I could have had still. After my best friend killed himself I haven’t been the same. I can’t hold a conversation to save my life. I don’t care to hear for the four hundredth time that you hate your job, but refuse to do anything about it. When I’m in a room full of people I sit in a corner looking at my phone in hopes that no one will talk to me. I don’t want anyone to talk to me. Just leave me the fuck alone....but then here I am so desperately wishing I had a friend. I don’t deserve one until I can put the effort into one and I can’t find for the life of me how to do that. 

My family...god it’s just been ripped apart and it’s getting harder and harder to put back together. My grandpa passed away from losing a battle to cancer. He was my hero and I’ve felt lost since. My dad was arrest 5 years ago for some shit, my mom lost it. Relapsed and has been on meth since and refusing any kind of rehab. My eldest brother tried helping her for the first 2 years. Even after my dad got out of jail he helped him too. This made it so I didn’t talk to him for that time. Because I was so pissed at my parents I wasn’t talking to them. Which meant I wasn’t talking to my brother because I couldn’t go to his house anymore. My youngest brother was pissed at me for “abandoning” my family and he refused to talk to me during this time too. And my grandma pad also pissed that I was being a bad daughter which made my moms drug use worse. So I didn’t talk to my family in 2 years. The first 2 years in my life that I literally had no family. That’s when my best friend killed himself in the middle of all this. 

My depression grew and grew. The few friends I still had at that point started to dwindle more as I didn’t have the energy to keep up with what I should have. I started staying home more and more. Stopped checking my phone. Deleted my social media. I just didn’t have the energy to do it anymore. I had 1 friend left at the end of all this. Just 1. I thought she and I would be together through hell. Until that fell apart (due to her making me lose trust in her). It’s been 3 years now. 

I do speak to my father now. We are working on building a relationship again. And it’s nice. But I see him once every couple of months. My eldest brother has a wife and kid now, but we don’t talk talk. We see each other at family stuff, but we don’t do anything but some small talk. My little brother lives with me now, so we do talk. But we’re not that close. Just some “bills this, bills that, job this job that” and I haven’t spoke to my mother in 4 years.

90,"Women should be able to choose whose DNA is going to be in their baby. They're the ones CARRYING it and DELIVERING it to the world. 

Of course, she does get to choose in the end, but for some reason, men are ALWAYS extremely disturbed by any idea that a woman would ever want to use another man's sperm for her baby. The only excuse they ever give is ""well it's evolutionary to want to raise your own child."" But you know what else is evolutionary? Rape. Murder. Infanticide.  

A man is IMMATURE if he thinks he should get to decide that. He still gets to be the FATHER. The REAL father, that is, the one who raises the child. The one who teaches the child. The one who supports the child. Genetics don't factor even a little bit into who the child belongs to.

So why are men upset when women say that the should get to choose the genetics of the baby?

91,"Growing up I was a very social kid, but pretty weird. I made up for it by being confident and outgoing, but as I got older and got bullied and went through major family issues, I lost that part of me and became very shut out and socially awkward. I was very behind on social skills and I had very few friends. My dad gave me some advice saying that he had to learn social skills just as you learn something like path, with practice.

Ever since then, I worked hard to become more charismatic and I have come very far from where I was before. I feel comfortable starting conversations and can keep them fairly well.

Now the problem is, there are some times where I feel like an actor reciting lines and faking emotions. I noticed a lot of the time it’s usually with relationships. I learned how to make someone feel special and how to flirt and make them feel something for me. I never do it to manipulate them, if anything I feel happy making them feel special, but in my heart it doesn’t seem to come from a genuine place.

• Please be fully dressed, it’s uncomfortable especially for female drivers. I’ve had people come out in their boxers.

• Don’t tell us to come inside your house unless it’s bad weather. It’s creepy.

• Don’t order right before closing. That means someone has to work overtime (depending on where, without pay), and deliver your pizza when they were supposed to be going home. Either order earlier or somewhere else.

• Don’t order pizza if you can’t tip. I don’t care if it’s the “governments’” job to pay us in full, we don’t get paid enough and the only person you’re screwing over are the workers. Go drive there and eat in yourself if you don’t want to give compensation for the delivery.

• Please don’t wave us over outside as if you ordered the pizza and then proceed to talk to us and ask us where we are delivering to. It’s wasting our time. 

• Please have the money ready. There’s nothing worse then having to wait an extra 10 minutes on a delivery because they don’t have the money with them.

• Don’t order in bad weather. Just don’t. “It’s their job to deliver pizzas,” sure, but you’re knowingly endangering a worker because they’re obligated to deliver. Just stay in or drive there yourself, don’t make people who get paid $4 come to your house during a hurricane.

• Don’t be mad if it takes awhile for your pizza to get there. The drivers don’t control the time.

97,"Few months ago I did an experience and woke up for 30 days (then another 60) at 5am aiming to change my habits, live at a different pace and study the impact on my day when focusing on myself early in the day. Could this have an impact on my mood and the control of my emotions during the day?


I was using this extra hour and a half to start the day with 20 minutes easy gym workout to wake up, 20 min of organising my day and 50 minutes working on my own project.


I then did a video on my YouTube channel where I was giving my opinion on the experience and posted a short article and a link on a forum I am a member of with a poll:


5am Club: Worth it?  YES/NO

This post went “viral” on this forum (considering the size of it) with 7k views in few weeks, 165 comments and 137 votes on the poll.


Here are the main points to take away from the poll and the responses from other members:


5am Club: Worth it?


YES: 85 votes (62%)

NO: 52 votes (38%)


Obviously, this question opened an interesting discussion facing night owls versus early birds.


When the 5am club members confirm they feel more productive when finally reaching work because their brain is fully awake, they already did something for themselves and have the gym done for the day, night owls respond that waking up so early is against nature and they feel more productive at night.


The main question and difference between all the participants was, how long is the longest uninterrupted block of hours you can have during the day and when does it happen?

This will obviously vary a lot depending on whether you have a family or not, or even just a partner.


Another point raised was the fact that your brain is more efficient after waking up (and a quick gym wake up routine) than after a full day at work, so working on your personal projects will be a lot more productive at 5am and you will end up achieving more! Night owls to argue that they struggle feeling fully awake that early leading to the next point.


One of the main struggles of people attempting to be part of the 5am club is to go to bed early. I myself suffered from this difficulty. Waking up at 5am means that by 11pm max and even 9 or 10pm, you should have your eyes closed and your head buried in your pillow.

If you fail, get ready to feel foggy the whole day if you need a minimum of 6/7 hours sleep to be functional! Miss your bedtime twice in a row and you will be lagging behind your whole week! So “discipline” is the key word here and one cannot succeed without it.


I would be interested in continuing this discussion here on reddit with you and hear about your experiences and what is your routine. How do you stay in control of your energy, productivity and emotions throughout the day? How would you have voted to this poll?

\*Throw-away account because this is my greatest shame\*

Something happened to me a few years ago that I still can't stop thinking about sometimes. A lot of people know part of the story, but not everything and I think that makes it worse for me to deal with. When I was 25, I was raped by a 17 year old boy who was a family friend (I'll call him WD). WD was staying at my dad's house one night and I happened to come home black out drunk from a local club, where I had been with some of my cousins. I don't even remember the sex at all, I didn't even know it happened until WD told my brother about it the next day and my brother told me.

I honestly didn't feel like I had been raped, I mostly felt embarrassment, and a lot of guilt because I had a long distance boyfriend at the time. (We hadn't met in person yet, but had been talking for 2 years at this point and had plans to meet two months after this happened). I only felt like I had cheated on him and that's the part I was upset about at the time, and so I told my bf about what happened with WD. I thought it was the right thing to do and I couldn't have dealt with the guilt. He ended up blaming me for it, getting tired of me being emotional about it, and completely left me a few weeks after it happened. He didn't just break up with me, he pretty much completely cut all contact. I was heartbroken and had no idea how to deal with all of this.

Socially, I was a late bloomer, and so this was my first boyfriend and first break up. And when I was raped that night it was the first time I'd had sex, I'd never even really kissed a guy before that night. So, my emotions were all messed up. I ended up talking to WD about what happened and he told me that he hadn't realized I was that drunk that night or he would have stopped, and he told me that he was really sorry. I believed him. He was someone I'd known for a while at that point, he was a nice kid that I had thought of as a younger brother. Since I forgave him, and couldn't make myself hate him, I ended up having feelings for him instead. I don't know if it's because he was my first or if it was because he was around still after my bf broke up with me, or what. I didn't have any of these feelings for him before that night it happened, and I didn't want to have them ever.

I kept the feelings to myself, because logically I knew I didn't want to date a 17 year old, I wouldn't. I did end up having sex with him a few more times (17 is age of consent in my state btw). Doing that made me feel better but worse at the same time. I liked the attention, but just knowing how the whole situation was kind of messed up made me feel ashamed and pathetic. Honestly the only part that other people don't know is about me having feelings for him. A lot of people found out about the sex. I was sort of ashamed about that part too, but that shame was nothing compared to how pathetic I felt as a mid 20's woman crying over, getting jealous over, having real feelings for a 17 year old kid.

Since I've never confessed that part, I really don't know how bad what I did and how I felt was. I have no idea how pathetic people would think I was if they knew, so I just assume that they would think I was as pathetic as I think I am and it makes me beyond upset. Even though I don't have these feelings anymore and I moved on quite a while ago, I just can't get over the almost whole year of my life that I spent either being depressed about a guy who left me for being raped, or fawning over an inappropriate relationship.",18Jun2019,3

104,"For any one who needs some motivation or inspiration:

I'm not quite sure how to word this. 

Recently I've realized I have depression and anxiety, actually for a while now. Having gone so long without realizing really affected my social life, as well as my mental health. After college, I just had a small group of friends who were amazing and a fiance I just recently got engaged to. However. Good things do come to an end. I stopped being as social, deleted Facebook because I thought it was too addicting, never posted pictures for my friends to see, kept to myself mostly. I was happy and very comfortable like that for years, or so I thought...

I broke up with my fiance because I realized I wasn't happy, in our relationship and with my life. I needed to make changes. I was tired of feeling angry for no reason and tired of having unfinished art projects because of lack of motivation. I know I can do so much better. So that's what I'm doing.

Im using my calendar more to get more organized. I bought a journal for daily entries and sketches and ideas. I'm being way more open with my feelings and I'm being honest and upright with people! It's amazing what can happen when you just tell people how you're feeling or what you're thinking about. They'll listen. I broke out my art supplies and I'm telling myself to make a little bit of art each day. I'm getting more sunlight. The pool just opened so I'll stop by for just 10 minutes every other day. I'm searching for a job to start my career (harder than expected btw). I did download Facebook again because despite being ""addicting"", I realized I was missing out on big and small news about my family and friends.

I was just so tired of feeling down and hurting those around me for no reason. I'm trying to be more positive and that starts with being positive about myself.

To those who feel like you're stuck in a ditch with no one to help you... please try to help yourself first. I know that may sound ignorant and not every one can do that but all that matters is that you at least tried!

108,"First of all, I’m currently a 14 year old male.

Throughout Primary School, I was a real dickhead. I used to be a ‘class clown’, and the only jokes I had were putting other people down, making their self esteem reach zero.

I was the top of the class and I skipped grades too, which of course, made me feel superior to everyone else, further escalating my ‘jokes’ and self-confidence.

I was praised for my intelligence, which was really nothing since I was the biggest fish in a small pond.

Because of this, when I reached High School, I assumed that I was the smartest by a landslide.

I continued to make these insulting jokes to other people and became ‘popular’. Again, a class clown.

After a couple of exams, I realised there was a girl who was smarter than me. By far.

And so I convinced myself I would beat her in a few tests, and we even made scores. I didn’t beat her a single time.

From there, my self-confidence plummeted.

Halfway through Year 8, (high school begins at year 7), I realised that I became lazy, and had no motivation to do anything. Even my family started to slowly despise me.

I became angry at the slightest thing, and just laid on the couch all day, with a blanket over my head, and on my phone.

I deleted all my posts from social media, and absolutely hated taking pictures of myself.

I pretended to have zero emotions by having a blank face, making me feel even sadder.

The sadness turned into anger, and I started to believe that everyone was manipulative and evil, that every human was selfish.

I also considered myself as selfish. I hated myself and everyone.

I realised that all of my good memories were gone. I literally couldn’t, (and still can’t), remember anything. Anything from the age of 0 to the age of 12-13, all of it was gone from my head.

Well, apart from some details. I could remember my name, and who I was, obviously, but I couldn’t remember how I ended up being like that.

Because of my deteriorating memory, my scores in tests, and my focus in lessons, dropped drastically.

Oh and I forgot to mention, I also began to overthink everything.

Every tiny thing, I would overthink. If someone were to glance at me, or if someone were to walk past me on the street, (which was a rare occasion, because I never went out), or even if I heard a small sound in the kitchen.

I began to feel fear. I would think that a person was about to do something to me, or a ghost would suddenly appear.

And because of my fear, I struggled to even take a shower or bath at night, and even to go to the toilet, I would have to tell myself that I was overthinking.

But even then, I would tremble and run down the stairs.

And when I slept, I slept under the covers to make sure nothing would get me.

Well, anyway, after Year 8, in Year 9, I began to slightly recover.

I discovered Reddit, and read about lots of topics. I saw things about self motivation, kindness, what males and females find likeable and attractive. What people in general would like.

But here, I think, started the biggest problem.

My confidence supposedly went up.

I still can’t talk to people properly. I speak too fast and mix up my words, I struggle to make eye contact, my heart is nearly beating out of my chest, and my head goes fuzzy.

Even typing this out is taking a hundred and ten percent of my effort.

I become more self-aware, and realised how I acted. The way I acted had quite a resemblance to the symptoms of most mental disorders, and other similar things.

I self-diagnosed myself with depression and anxiety. Yes, typical 14 yr old. So I told myself I don’t have them. It was just a self-diagnosis.

I also didn’t have the confidence and will to go out to a professional, so that ended there.

And because of the ghost problem, I diagnosed myself with Schizophrenia because I felt that I would see hallucinations, and had lots of the symptoms. Once again, I didn’t believe it.

I got out of my covers, and also began to talk a bit more to my family. I felt comfortable around them. They commented on how I seemed different and more happy, a better person. 

And I had friends at school, and talked to them.

However with other people, I was still a lost cause.

(I’ve probably repeated myself a thousand times. Sorry?)

As I was saying before, I read about being kind and likeable.

So, I began to pretend like I’m kind. I read that if you pretend like it you will eventually become it.

For a few months, I was being the kindest person I could: stepping up for people in trouble; helping them with homework and things they struggle with; just smiling; complimenting (which I struggled with, because confidence); etc.

However, inside my mind, I doubted myself.

I trusted everyone, but didn’t trust myself.

This is now the present.

I can’t do anything without believing I’m selfish, or that I’m a narcissist, or that I’m a sociopath, or that I’m just a fucked up waste that wears a mask to just fit in with society.

And whenever I have even the slightest thought about thinking I’m depressed, or schizophrenic, or just a mental retard, I deny it because why do I have the right to complain?

And so when I think I’m any of these things; narcissistic or schizophrenic, or anything else, I believe that I’m either doing this because I secretly love myself and am just an attention whore fishing for acceptance and assurance, or that I’m just a person with schizophrenia that’s just hallucinating everything.

I think I believe that I’m kind. I say ‘think’ because I can’t even tell if I believe that I’m kind.

Everything I do, a voice in my head tells me:

‘Really? Is this you?’

And so every deep thought process that I have to explore my subconscious and discover myself, usually ends up with me doubting myself, and saying:

“Oh, I’m just overthinking.”

The thought process ends there.

Back to being a kind person, which I truly enjoy, because I feel that I love people. But I can’t type this without doubting myself, do I truly love people, or is it just another mask that I created to fit in? To have an identity?

And so the next day, I overthink again.

And then the cycle repeats.


I would write a TL;DR, but I have no idea how to summarise myself (i think) into a few sentences. If you’ve read this badly-formatted post, thank you.

And it probably made you cringe reading this whole thing, but:

SEALs [persevere](https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/heres-the-ultimate-navy-seal-guide-to-exceptional-success-and-achievement.html). During training, one can easily give up by ringing a bell in the middle of the compound. “All you have to do to quit–is ring the bell. Ring the bell and you no longer have to wake up at 5 o’clock,” says McRaven. “Ring the bell and you no longer have to do the freezing cold swims. Ring the bell and you no longer have to do the runs, the obstacle course, the PT–and you no longer have to endure the hardships of training. Just ring the bell.”

Most ring the bell. The others become Navy Seals.

“If you want to change the world,” McRaven says, “don’t ever, ever ring the bell.”

**Don’t judge**

McRaven talked about SEAL training and some small classmates, no taller than five-feet-five. “The big men in the other boat crews would always make good-natured fun of the tiny little flippers the munchkins put on their tiny little feet prior to every swim,” he said. “But somehow these little guys, from every corner of the Nation and the world, always had the last laugh– swimming faster than everyone and reaching the shore long before the rest of us. SEAL training was a great equalizer.”

**Be humble**

Humility is another key for SEALs. “What it has to do with is the fact that the person is not humble enough to accept responsibility when things go wrong, accept that there might be better ways to do things, and they just have a closed mind,” says Jocko Willink, coauthor of Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win. “They can’t change, and that’s what makes a person fail as a leader.”

His coauthor Leif Babin added: “No leader has it all figured out. You can’t rely on yourself. You’ve got to rely on other people, so you’ve got to ask for help, you’ve got to empower the team, and you’ve got to accept constructive criticism.”

**Prepare for failure**

In order to persevere during SEAL training, Greitens borrowed methods from the Greek Stoics. The Stoics mentally rehearsed how they would respond in the event something went wrong, naming the practice “Premeditation of Evils.”

During training, aspiring SEALs must plunge into water, do a front flip underwater, then swim the length of the pool and back without emerging for air. Greitens practiced for the moment when he runs out of breath and can’t see the finish line.

“If the first time you do it is during the test, you’re going to bolt for the surface,” he said. “If you’ve thought about it over and over again, when that moment comes, you’ll know how to react.”

**Have fun. Be adventurous**

Davis also underscores the importance of play. ”Fun and adventure have a very pragmatic purpose.” Play allows our brains to reset and more, he says.

“…\[I\]t puts us in a state of creativity that allows us to better formulate the thinking, strategies, and tactics that we need to design and execute to complete our missions,” he says. “Without it, we fail to compete, and if we fail to compete, we lose.”

**Don’t give up on your dreams**

By the time Mr. Davis had a job in the insurance agency, bouncing from one agency to another, he too was living a life of sacrifice and not intent. But, he had an epiphany.

“Man, one of the first things I’m showing my children how to do is to give up on their dreams,” he realized. “Right then, I determined that was an unacceptable example, so I re-joined the Navy, reapplied for SEAL training, graduated, and served as a Navy SEAL for 10 years.”

111,"Everyone has them, right?

     I've been feeling increasingly frustrated in my place of work. The boss/owner is constantly invalidating my feelings and opinions and making large deals out of things that don't seem too terrible IMO.
     Example: Myself and my colleague went to Staples to pick up a hole punch that was needed for the office for her to complete a task, she doesn't drive, we told our colleagues in the same office as us- because there are two on separate floors- that we were both leaving in case phones ring, etc. But we got written up for leaving at the same time without telling HR in the downstairs office because she came upstairs literally one minute after we left and started messaging my coworker about how unacceptable and disrespectful our behaviour is.)
     Anyway, I've been here about two years and I think maybe I'm just over emotionally invested? I wanted to be part of growing and helping the company, but now due to lack of sales I am seeing it steadily decline, and have even suggested different routes we could possibly go, but boss has this crazy dream and won't let it die. Until about a month ago, she comes in and cuts everyone's hours saying she has to do it and can't keep supporting everyone and nobody is making sales and what did she even hire us for (spoiler alert: none of the four of us were hired for sales and we all have a bunch of different duties/tasks).
      I'm applying to other jobs that seem like they might be a good fit for me, but the mental wear that has been going on in the current company has me emotionally downtrodden. It also doesn't help that a company I interviewed with, and then had a second interview with never replied to me and I saw they reposted the job again yesterday (even though they claimed to have had a ""top 3"").
     I really really just want to give a two-week's, especially since I'm two weeks behind in pay, if they are ethical and will pay me, that means I would in theory have a month of pay assuming they don't say I can leave w/o the two week notice (I don't think they would because nobody else in the company knows how to do the larger aspect of my role). But I also have a three year old and his cost of daycare is more than rent. I want to make sure he is provided for, so I am pushing but am just in the middle of a mental burnout where I'm silently crying at my desk and hoping nobody notices.

TL;DR
I hate my job. The more I realize this, the more trouble I seem to get in (usually just trying to help). Trying to find a new job, not a lot of luck so far. 

      Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? Is there a silver lining? Did I do something wrong? Should I change my outlook? Am I too eager? Just kind of looking for someone to tell me if I'm crazy or not.",18Jun2019,1
112,"I used to work at this restaurant in an immigrant neighborhood. Old mobsters would drop by all the time to hang out with the owner and some of the things I saw made me think.


A poor family from the old country sent their 15yr old son live with one of the old mobsters. The plan was that he boy could work at the restaurant, learn english, and maybe end up living in the states under the old man's guidance. When the boy first came all the old guys loved him. ""Little Niko, come have coffee!"", ""Niko, stay away from these american women, they'll make you crazy!"" It was fun having this new kid around, but the whole situation was weird. These men are wealthy and well connected. I guess this family saw an opportunity to get a better life for their son. Traditional culture can be silly when it comes to respect. One day Niko was gone. Turns out Niko was working with one of the old men and they got into an argument. The guy screamed at Nico and Nico spoke back. That same day they called Nico into the back of the restaurant, and two old men beat the shit out of him, handed him a plane ticket and put him in a taxi to the airport. 

I don't have any kids, but could you imagine sending your 15yr old boy from a small village, to a big city to live with old rich mobsters. Only to have them beat the fuck out of him and ship him back home. 

When we heard the story all the guys were laughing, ""Those two psychopaths beat the shit out of the boy!"", ""Old men are grumpy, you don't want to get on their nerves!"" The whole situation made me nauseous. 

People have this romantic view of organized crime, but these guys are just adult bullies. Often thugs are seen as charming, wise, and charismatic. People over look the intense rage and violence these guys have in them.",18Jun2019,2

120,"Everyone can be forgetful, I know that is normal. But as a 6 y/o child I thought it made me stupid. So at some point I had a *wonderful* idea, that if I pick a code word that I must remember every time I don’t want to forgot something. If I do forget that something I can remember the code word, and coincidentally whatever I forgot would be remembered.!

At the time it was a solid plan. However now I don’t understand why I thought it was at all a good idea.

I chose ‘tin can’ as the code word (don’t ask why because I don’t even know) The first few times it didn’t work (obviously) Still, I was determined! Eventually if I forgot something, I wouldn’t remember whatever it was I forgot but instead I’d only remember the code word ‘tin cans’!This was annoying as I was supposed to remember ‘tin cans’ *and* whatever it was I forgot.

A couple years pass (8 or 9) and I ironically forgot about the ‘tin can’ idea. But for some stupid reason I just remembered it out of thin air. And now ever since then, if i forgot something the *first* thing that unwontedly comes to mind is now ‘tin cans’!

Trying to explain it in words is seriously difficult and I would be impressed if you could get half of it tbh 😂

TL:DR hated to forget things as a kid so I made a code word to help me remember. Now whenever I forget something I can only remember the code word and nothing else.",18Jun2019,15
121,"He was ill for maybe a week. It started with a bad cough but it got so bad. I feel so fucking bad I was late for school last Tuesday I think and my mom wasn't here so I asked my dad if he could drive me. I even tried to hurry him a bit but I forgot he wasn't feeling well. He had to cough a bit during a roundabout and I had to help him steer for a split second I can't believe I treated my dad like this. I didn't do anything for Father's day because our family usually isn't too much into holidays like that, if we'd go do anything it would be go out eat brunch together but he was ill in bed so of course we did not. I thought about baking a sugar free cake for him, but that thought passed as quick as it came to me.


My mom drives me to school in the morning usually, because I'm an egoistic lazy person. I try to wake up early enough to go by bike, but I'm always late. I had given up on that concept already and my mom didn't mind because she just wants me to go to school.



Anyway Sunday I was thinking of just biking to school so my mom didn't have to take care of another person and could just stay at home and sleep in because she was obviously tired from working all day and taking care of my dad. My sister asked me to just bike too. Now I think about it, in the afternoon I was just gaming the entire time with like earphones in while I was home alone with my dad. I had asked him in the morning and in the afternoon if he wanted to eat something and brought him some porridge my mom made. I was tired from all the school, studying, helping at our restaurant and working at my part time job so I just wanted to relax and play some games. In fucking hindsight I should've not been so neglecting and only worried about myself and just stayed by my dad's side. I honestly doubt anyone's is reading this far in this mess but please I'm not looking for pity and I'm not trying to make this about myself and I don't deserve the pity at all here.




I already thought it was off how hard my dad was breathing, but I never stopped to think it could be so serious. I just trusted my mom. I should've said something about it before the emergency services got here. Honestly I should've just paid more attention. My dad was so ill and I didn't even fucking realize and I wasn't even fucking aware.




I went to sleep and I told my mom she didn't have to get up to drive me to school or make breakfast. I woke up early and got ready and left early for school. The first time I'd done in a really long time. On the way there I listened to a podcast about bananas, I hadn't finished it and I planned to listen the rest of it when I went home again. I told my friends all about the stuff I had heard in the podcast. I didn't even think about the wellbeing of my dad during my classes. 



I'm in study hall, preparing for my test the next hour. The concierge comes to me the last three minutes before the bell would ring and tells me my sister is downstairs. I was confused, had a small feeling it might be about my dad and stood up to walk downstairs. She says I'd better bring my bag and it's about your dad. I feel adrenaline rushing in my body and say a goodbye to my friends sitting next to me. She said let me know what's up when you know. 


I walk downstairs and I see my sister visually shaken. The concierge asks me if she should go and let my teachers know I'm absent for the rest of the day, I'm wasn't sure why she would do that but I said okay. My sister and I walk to the car and she says our dad is in the icu. I began to panic a bit. My sister and I are never really serious or anything, so this was really different. I was thinking it was fucking horrible but he is in a controlled environment with medicine that's based on science and stuff and doctors who know a lot, so he is in good hands. The best possible situation, one could make out of this non desirable situation. 



We get there and my mom looks like she's crying. We went to go visit my dad but I was really scared to go. We all cried. We enter the room and my dad is laying in the bed. He has his eyes closed. His skin is very swollen. He has all kinds of tubes in him and a bunch of monitors with numbers on them next to him. The doctor gives us a rundown and says they put him to sleep and they're waiting for results. I can't remember completely what he said but everything he said that day was indicating he was not going to make it. Something like we're expecting a or b, but if scenario a: he's probably not going to make it but if scnerario b: he's probably not going to make it. He had really acidic blood because of a maybe bad reaction to some diabetes medicine. Immediately after my dad got here, his heart stopped beating and they had to perform the massage thing for four minutes. They were glad his heart began beating again, but he still had the blood issues. My sister asked if the doctor had seen it before and he said yes, in most cases they don't make it and this was also the worst case he had seen. His kidney is completely non functioning and he has a dialysis. I walked behind them back to our family room. The entire time I tried to not cry for my mom but it just happened. 



It was really quiet in the room while we were waiting. I didn't know what to say. My sister went to grab something out of the car and I went to get some tea for my mom. I was alone and I felt scared. When we all were back in the room it was still quiet. We got the results back and they were OK. Not what they were expecting, but a possible pancreas infection. The doctor was still pretty firm in thinking he was not going to make it. My mom's native language isn't this one, so she doesn't understand everything. 


I'm so sorry about the non chronological order. Later that day my mom told me that shortly after I had left for school, she had called the family doctor. My dad couldn't walk but the assistent on the phone said our family doctor could only do visits after 4 o'clock, my mom talked directly to our doctor and she agreed to come over. She got here and agreed there was something really wrong with my dad, she didn't know what but they should call the emergency services right now. They did and when they came, they took all the stats of my dad and it all came out OK. Blood pressure alright, sugar alright, heart rate and stuff. They insisted my dad would get up and walk to the ambulance himself, but if course he couldn't. They yelled at him but eventually helped him I think. 

I'm so glad I just fucking biked. I think it's the only thing I didn't fuck up. I could've easily just laid longer in bed and just walk into my parents room and ask my mom to bring me, something I've done plenty of times. I'm so so so glad I didn't do it. What if I did? And my mom would've been out while my dad was alone. It didn't happen, but I just feel like a fucking idiot for even letting the possibility exist.


We had to wait so long for unknown time in our own small waiting room. In the beginning my mom was like no we don't need to order food now, we'll just grab something on our way home soon. Saying stuff indicating she wasn't thinking we were going to be staying here for a while, little did she know we ended up staying there for around 30 hours. 


Around some time, it became clear we were going to be there for a while to my mom and my sister and I went home to grab some stuff to stay overnight. We got home and my sister said to me that some stuff from the guys from the ambulance was still visible on the bed. I took a peek and saw bandages and some kind of empty needle tube. I felt even worse. We grabbed the stuff we needed and I washed my face while my sister picked up the food and hung a note saying we're not open or whatever on the door of the restaurant. She came back and we went back to the hospital. 



All the waiting in the waiting room kind of blends together. It sounds heartless and in hindsight I don't understand how I was able to, but I listened to some other podcasts and watched the beginning of a movie. Later on my sister's boyfriend dropped by with food and stuff. He had his stocks and investments on his laptop, I asked him some about it and we talked about it for a while. 



We went to sleep on the small weird chairs that apparently extend. My mom and sister couldn't sleep but I slept through. I woke up from my alarm for school I forgot to turn off. My mom wasn't there, I continued sleeping for a bit. I think eventually we all dropped by our dad and the nurse told us he had improved a lot and is a lot more stable than last night. I'm still scared to see my dad like this. My mom and sister are touching his hand and stroking his face but I just look. 


We get breakfast in the food area in the hospital. We go back and spend the rest of the day in my dad's room. First we were together, then my mom leaves to go home and do some stuff. My sister says his hand is swollen and I should feel it. I don't. A bit later I finally do. It was weird because my family in general doesn't do a lot of physical displays of affection or whatever. My sister reads news headlines to him, because he's always watching the news. She stops after a couple, because there rest is negative. 


Gradually that day he starts opening his eyes a bit sometimes. He also moved his hands and legs a bit. It's uneasing to see him try to cough, because he has a breathing tube and he basically chokes and gets really red in the face but the nurse says it's okay. I talk a bit to him and touch his hand.



The nurse says the family waiting room is only for one day and we have to make room for others. The doctor also says that he was in critical condition last night and he wasn't sure if he was going to pass away that night or not, but that moment's passed and now he is stable so we can just go home. It'll take a long time to recover but it's going the right way. My mom and sister are reluctant but we agree. My mom says goodbye and my dad squeezes her hand and moves a lot. 


We go home. On our way home, we stop by a restaurant of my moms friend. In the car ride there, my mom and sister are talking about selling the restaurant and just buying another one. It was already in consideration to buy this other restaurant while also keeping this one, but I guess. Before we go in, my sister tells my mom not to agree to a low price. We go in, my mom and her friend talk, my mom cries, we get the food and go to the car again. We drive home.



We get back and it all settles in. I see a bunch of letters from the bank and insurance company I think on the ground. I was pretty sure it would just get covered by the insurance company, but I also saw my mom adding up some big numbers on the calculator on her phone when we were at the hospital. I don't know. I walk to my parents room and throw away the stuff the paramedics left. 



My sister says I should eat before the food gets cold but I'm not hungry. I try to hide my crying but it's not working. I took a shower which made me feel clean. Looking into the mirror and seeing myself made me cry harder.



My mom folded the laundry and called me over to get my clothes. She hands me some of my clothes and a pillow case. I put the clothes in my closet and bring the pillow case to the closet it belongs to, in my parents room. I walk in and see my mom made her side of the bed and left the blanket and stuff the way it was on dad's side. I cried.


I cried thinking about how I'm going to explain to my friends why I missed school these two days. About how I'm going to tell anyone. My friends texted me yesterday if everything's fine and I just said it's fine and they shouldn't worry because I don't want to give them more worries. Finals next week too and my friends are super stressed and I don't want  to lay this on them too. My other friends who are having their summer break already, I don't want to bother them. I texted my boss saying my dad's on the icu and I don't bink I can work this week and she said I should call her, I told her I don't think I have time to call. I feel lonely but there's nothing about it. I wish I could talk to someone about it. 


 Everything just felt so surreal, unbelievably surreal. Multiple times I just looked at my hands and thought, is this all just a really detailed dream?

I have a whole lots of issues and ever since I've turned 20 it' hasn't been too easy. I suffer mentally, I do want to seek help but at the same time I'm scared to be judged because I try so hard to better myself but at the same time I feel like I keep making excuses.

Once school started in the fall and my job contract was up I was alittle optimistic and I thought that things would get better. But at the same time I was making way less money and school was starting to drain me mentally again, so I decided to with drawl and take some time off, hoping to get accepted into a school that would be more suitable for me. Fast forward didnt get accepted in time, still unemployed, currently seeking employment. I also moved cities and states. I dont know why it took me so long to address it.

I know he is depressed but I also know he isn't helping himself. His room is absolutely disgusting. I gave him a clothes organizer and it's sat unbuilt for the last two weeks. He leaves we're trash and shit everywhere. Basically picking stuff up and then just dropping it when he's done using it. There's been face face on the kitchen counter for the last 3 days. He trims his beard and leave the hair in the sink every morning an his trimmer covered in hair out despite me clearing a space for him. He'll also leave his bong in the bathroom. I don't mind that he smokes but just don't leave your shit around. I don't know how he's not embarrassed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I work full time and am doing side jobs and other projects. I feel totally overwhelmed and every time I come home and see him just sit-in there while things are messy it drives me crazy. 1.) because I feel like he should clean up and has all the time in the world to do it. 2.) Because I feel like I'm just slowly watching someone waste their life.",18Jun2019,6
127,"I think this is what’s best for me but I can’t get myself to stop talking to her. I’m in love with her and she doesn’t feel the same way about me. She doesn’t know this yet. I plan on telling her how I feel then cutting off ties with her to speed up the “gettigng over” process.

Maybe I’ll do it, I doubt it though.",18Jun2019,2
128,I’m in my summer break before senior year starts for high school. I’m feeling really bad thinking about cords for graduation. I haven’t participated much throughout school and now I’m really self-conscious and anxious thinking about how I’ll only be getting few. That and the fact that I can’t say that I’ve achieved a lot. I feel like wearing few cords will make that visible,18Jun2019,1
129,"It’s the worst place ever. There’s nobody in the neighborhood who I can talk to or anyone whose even around my age. The only actually interesting thing to do there is go in the hot tub outside, except it’s been broken for years. When I go there, there’s nothing for me to do except waste my life away and be forced to go to church every Sunday and it’s so boring.

I’d want to get a job or volunteer somewhere over the summer, but of course my dad won’t let me. He’s always at work anyways so it’s not like there’s anywhere I can go with him and the rest of my family. Last year all we did was go grocery shopping like every week and sometimes get Chinese food or like chick-fil-a or something, and we’d occasionally go shopping for clothes, and that’s it. And all my days there are spent me just being so bored that I’ll just sleep to relieve my boredom, or I’ll just go on my phone all day. 

I want to stay at my mom’s place because I actually have friends here, there’s a neighborhood pool that I can go to, and I can actually volunteer and do something productive and my mom will let me. 

My sister asked my dad if she could stay here so she could do cheerleading over the summer, and of course he said no so I can’t stay either. When I go to his house my summers are just spent by me wasting my life away. 

And the worst thing ever is that there’s always the same food.

For breakfast, there’s only the jimmy dean breakfast bowl, toaster strudels, and stale cereal that’s been in the cabinets since like 2012. And then for lunch there’s ramen noodles, meat pie, salad, and pot pie. For dinner we usually just have rice or lasagna. I normally go to his house every other weekend, and I’ve eaten everything listed above SO many times to the point where I can barely smell them or see them or eat them without feeling disgusted. And he refuses to buy anything else. We buy food out like once or twice a week so sometimes I’m good.

I’m not going to have a good summer this year, and I’m upset about it.",18Jun2019,1
130,"So, my bike broke down yesterday so my step dad came to get me and the bike. As I was lifting the bike my finger was caught between the fork and wheel, so when the wheel was in the car it started rolling and dragged off the middle of my nail.
Idk how to make it not hurt bc the pain is spreading in to my hand and I can't sleep.

I've already told a lot of ppl about this, but I need some advice about how to make my finger not hurt as much. (I've already taken pain meds and they didn't work)",18Jun2019,1
132,"I've struggled with asthma since I was a baby. Its kept me from playing sports, participating in P.E. in school, and do basic exercises. For the past year or so I've tried going to the gym on a more regular schedule, and at the beginning, I kept being discouraged by the asthma I'd get during and after my workouts. I'd feel light-headed and dizzy and unable to breathe, and it made me want to quit and just deal with gaining weight and being out of shape.

I finally got tired of it. For the last 4 months, I've made an effort to be on a low-carb diet (proven to reduce asthma), I've been eating more regularly, and I've been taking some natural medications. I started noticing some differences in my asthma, and decided to start going to the gym again.

After about a month of going every other day and doing full body workouts, today I was FINALLY able to go up in weight that I was lifting. I haven't had asthma from the gym in quite a while. Not only that, but I'm starting to notice some physical differences, too. I feel great right now.",18Jun2019,5
