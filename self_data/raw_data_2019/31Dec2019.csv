0,"Every place I go online I see people recapping their last ten years and every time I see one of those posts I take a look back to see what good I have to share, so let me give you a preview: nothing. 


Ten years ago I didn`t know but I was about to live the worst ten years of my life – so far. It started with losing my father who was brutally murdered in the corner of my street, then a few months after my mother, who is not dead, but for the past nine years hasn`t made use of the Mother title. I also lost a brother but I might have never had one. I don’t really know. 


I did manage to finish school, then after that the only thing I could do was sit behind a computer screen and play online games for hours. It was my escape route from a world where I no longer had anybody with me.  


Late in 2017 I decided to start something, anything just to get myself out of the house. I started a very basic classroom course, which gave me the chance to once again interact with others. It was no big deal and so far I haven`t made use of it, but from there I got myself listed to another program, which then led me to my first job. One year has passed and I got another job offer which could offer me stability and growth. I took it. So far it seems to be what I thought it would be. I`m trying to give it value. 


I managed to turn myself into a good professional and a good person – for those who deserves it. My world is still empty, what I lost back then seems to be lost forever. It`s just me, the men above and the one under my feet. I learned how to praise one and respect the other, respectively, but the credits to my progress I will always give to myself. 


Right know and ever since I`ve been fighting the loneliness, which didn`t hold much power back then due to all my other necessities, but at every accomplishment I get in my life it only gets stronger. I don`t know for how long it will persist in the next ten years to come. I can only hope to win this battle soon. In any way possible. Be it by siding with a living one or joining the ones who is no longer among us. I know it seems stupid to give so much power for a problem which, theoretically, doesn`t exist. I`m fighting with an empty space.

 
I don`t like to expose myself, be it online or in real life, but this brief recap somehow feels necessary to add value to the history I will be telling ten years from now. In 2017 when I started to breath fresh air again, I draw my goals for the next fifteen years, and so far I`m on track, and I will continue. I don`t have hope in the future. I don`t have hope things will get better. I don`t have hope. Hope is what kills people. All I have is notion of my capabilities and power of will. I expect it to be enough to accomplish it all. The next history I will adress to you all.


Happy new year to you. And whatever the history you are telling now, I wish you the chance to be telling one even better in the next ten years.",31Dec2019,1

4," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ on email replies and said it in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. Sometimes she will ask me something related to jobs etc then when is she whatever is ya she will abruptly reply ‘did yer’ in what seems a snotty/sarcastic way 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?



Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence : /",31Dec2019,1

6,"I went to that place to look for answers and objective discussions on the ideas that r/thebluepill and r/theredpill propose, but instead I’ve primarily seen posts that argue this and that about how men are fucked or society needs to get their shit together. Worst part is that a lot of these posts actually do provide evidence and sources to back up their claims, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that those resources are logically sound or that they finalize an absolute truth. They seem to be cherry-picked statistics from what I’ve noticed, or they fall for cognitive biases. Scroll by the top posts of all-time and you’ll see a few examples.

I also particularly remember a question posted asking something along the lines of “Men are getting woke about dating. What happens now?”. You’d expect the comments to discuss the possibilities and look at different opposing angles to try to suggest a reasonable truth. Unfortunately, the majority of the responses were defeatist, catastrophizing assertions, that only really seemed to echo the choir; saying things like there will be more young men becoming radicalized and that there will be more mass shootings and that’s there going to be a great big gender Helter Skelter and blah blah blah. Goddamnit. Exposing myself to this kind of content has only really made me forget that there’s more to think about than just sad online ramblings. Made me forget that in the real world, nobody refers to “pill” ideologies or get so concerned over systematic oppression and what not. Even here on Reddit can you see that on the more casual subs that nobody takes this kind of stuff seriously, or take other unexciting lame stuff seriously for that matter. I sometimes wonder what comedians that find the stupidity in everything like George Carlin would have to say. I mean, people like him already tend to view life in depressing and despondent points of view. This kind of stuff would be like Tuesday morning for them. I gotta adhere to their method of not giving a shit about bullshit. Takes the load off of thinking and perceiving the world in unreasonable ways.",31Dec2019,1
7,"I come to you all today to ask for some genuine advice, and honesty. For a while now I have been trying to work towards being able to write my own music, and play live shows with what I've created. Bought keyboards, my parents have been nothing but supportive and even graciously helped me out with buying a MacBook to start learning GarageBand to have a place to jot down and materialize any ideas I've had. 

Now that I have enough to actually get started, I really feel like I'm lacking the knowledge on it all. I've been playing piano self taught for a few years now, and feel pretty comfortable just being able to riff stuff without knowing any of the technicalities that come with it. I have ideas that boost my enthusiasm and love for it, but I cannot for the life of me create ANYTHING when it comes to it. Im struggling with learning how to use the software, and I feel lost on fully utilizing some of the gear I thought would help me break through this.

I feel lost. And I don't know where to go or who to talk to to help me, teach me. Anything. And honestly, I feel like its no longer a possibility for me and I'm just wasting my time and money. What do I do? What can I do? 

I don't expect in the slightest that this would ever be my main thing or anything. This is just something I've always wanted to be able to do and experience.

11,"First of all, I love my parents, but as the title says, I want to talk about some mistakes that they have done with parenting. This is a mostly a vent, but it can be seen as a list of ""what not to do"" for parents.

• When I went through bullying.

When I was little I would play videogames with my brother, once I went to school I would also play with my classmates and my best friend.
The girls from other classes would start making fun of me for spending so much time with my male friends instead of playing with the other girls and their dolls. They would say i was a tomboy, gross, weird, etc. I was never really damaged fisically but once I was able to understand what they were saying about me it affected my selfsteem, this went on from when I was 6 to 14. During that time I made some friends that supported me.

My parents knew I was being bullied, but did nothing, those girls would even tell my mom how weird I was and they still did nothing, not even tell the teacher, they just told me that I should not get in a fight with them, just ignore them.

• Puberty.

I knew about menstruation because of school and friends, but my mom only told me once about it when I was too young to even understand what she was talking about, so once I got my period for the first time I was too scared to tell her so I decided to stay still in the chair and cry instead of telling her what was going on, I even had to google ""how to tell your mom that you got your period"".

My mom was sitting next to me but it took me like an hour or more to tell her, this was probably avoidable if she had told me more about this once I was older.

• Puberty 2.

Boobs, yes, boobs. I knew that bras existed, but I had none, I didn't even noticed I needed them until the boys started making fun of me for not wearing them.

My parents never told me I should wear them until I asked for them, everyone could see my nipples through the uniform, but for some reason nobody told me what I needed.

• Sex and masturbation.

My parents are catholic, so they told me that I could only have sexual acts once I was married and that masturbation was bad. Because of my friends and bf I realised that way of thinking was bad and making me feel guilty for nothing.

My knowledge of sexual related stuff is very low and it makes me feel scared of doing anything related to sex and it gives me pain because of anxious I feel and most of it is because of that idea that they gave me.

They dont say those things anymore since my brother had his first relationship, but the idea was already in my head for too long to forget it so easily.

• Respect to others and my relationship.

My parents are xenophobic, racist and classists. Luckily im not, because most of the friends I did while playing videogames were from different countries and etc.

When I had 17 I entered my first relationship, a long distance relationship. Since I knew my parents were xenophobic I was afraid of telling them, because I knew that they wouldn't support me, in the end I told them like 2 months ago, my ldr was 2 years and a half old and they still had no idea.

• My overprotective parents.

My parents have always insisted on going to pick me up in the night when im hanging out with my friends, even if its not that late, and not even if its a big group (I mean me and my friends) going back home together.
They always need to know where I am, with who, etc. I know it sounds normal, they are worried about me, but I think I need some space to go out on my own with friends too.

Related to the last • of them being xenophobic, Im planning to travel to meet with my bf and again they are not allowing me to go or at least not to go on my own. (Im still doing it, its my money and Im old enough to do it without permission).

• Feeling femenine and pretty.

I have a lot of selfsteem issues, because I was bullied when I was young I don't feel femenine like other girls, my mom never really told me about make up, or about how shave, so I felt uncomfortable wearing skirts or shorts because I had no idea of how to deal with the hair in my legs, I have PCOS so I also have a little bit more hair than others. Same thing happened with facial hair. In the end I started doing it on my own and I cutted myself sometimes. In the end my aunt showed me how to use an epilator and it helped a lot.

Nails, I dont have nails because I tend to bite them, so Im always hiding my hands.

Body issues, my mom always tells me how skinny she was, about the huge boobs and ass she had and that I dont have. Just this month she was telling me that she weighted a lot less than me at my age, even though im under normal weight and the doctor told me I should eat more.
She also has been telling me that I've lost my waist and that my ass is smaller.

This has been making me feel even worse, and please, if you are a parent or a friend, don't say those things or at least not that way.

(Small note, 2020 isn’t the end of the decade FYI, it’s 2021) 

 

              2020... it really feels as if it wasn’t long ago that I was hugging mother after a day at elementary school, or the last time I was eating the last meal with grandma, I still can’t perceive that 10 years has passed... the perception of time and how it moves quickly is truly amazing but at the same time scary, frightening and worrying. I don’t think it was at all an amazing decade, nor will I call it the worse, it had its charm, its moments and its lessons, I learned a lot and meet even more people, discovered new stuff about a lot of thing including myself, it also took a toll on me, mentally and physically which drained me, yeah I know some may say that It’s “adult life” (even though I ain’t an adult yet :/)  and that’s how it is, I call that a BS argument to be honest. Anyway, we’re not here to talk about how shitty it was but how it WAS in general, everything from the good and bad to the ugly (haha u get it?). 

 

 

              Let’s start by the Bad and ugly, shall we? As I said before it wasn’t the worst, does mean all it gave me was butterflies and fairies, some dark shit came out of it as well... Some of it is the loneliness I felt during all that duration, it really put me in a scary place, had some thoughts that destroyed me, broke down many times but I stood put, didn’t work all the time though it when it did I felt powerful and had control over my life. My lowest probably was 4-5 years ago when we first moved from a city to another, it’s not that specific action which promoted the state I got in, it was the fact that my life was brightening up at that moment before we moved, I don’t want to go into details to be honest but just know that it really was THAT bad, okay? Then came the fact that I lost many important people in the span of a couple years, some close ones, and by lost I don’t mean they just left this world, if only it was just that... some died others just stepped out while showing their true colors, some affected only me others did so to the whole family, my only father other father figure followed my father and left with a smile, we didn’t have many memories but he was the only thing that can remind me of him... I don’t remember much of my father as I was about 2 or 3 when he passed but I felt a bit of a connection to him when he passed away too, sometimes I wish I could hug them one last time and put aside my problems for a second... some family members really gave us hell too, they torn the family apart but here we are standing realizing we don’t really need them but to be completely honest... I wish we all were still one big force together... When My friends start telling me about how they did this with their family members, or went there with another one... man, it really makes me question why it all happened. Again, not going to get into detail as it’s pretty personal. 

              Then came some other shit that completely wrecked me in the past 2 years... family, friends and absolutely everything came down on me which just drained the absolute bejesus out of me though I still stood my ground and got up again, went out of my education focus because of my mental health and it MASSIVELY affected my grades and I regret all my actions, plus the fact that I’ve been staring that the same 4 walls for like 2-3 years now and it really is slowly driving me insane. I hope I can fix it in the next year or so. Oh, and my academic year and higher education started with a bust... I feel like a clown hahaha but that’s a story for another time. 

 

 

              Now comes the good stuff! Not a lot, it might even be shorter than the other shit. Well then, I meet new friends, like NEW new and friendly ones, some I’m proud to even call my best friends and I still can’t comprehend how they agreed to befriend my ugly annoying ass and one of them even is dating me... damn... but I’m truly grateful for them and the luckiest. PLUS, it’s the first time someone I have NEVER MET before sent me something and it’s not even for a special occasion nor is it some expensive shit and I actually don’t want that to be honest, he just sent me a small box with anime pins and a keychain thingy and I. LOVE. IT! Oh, and how can I forget the greatest friend of them all? My foreign French best friend, one of the only ones that has stayed with me for this long, I think it’s about 9 years now... I still remember the days I was playing Minecraft with his crazy ass destroying everything with TNT and griefing EVERYONE... haha good times... then we moved to Terraria, Starbound, Rainbow, The forest and a lot others, I think some of the happiest moments are with him, once I was laughing so hard and loud the neighbors started yelling at me lmaooo, If you’re reading this my friend... I hope you’ll stay with my dumbass even if I’m mostly away and not here to be with you, I’m sorry friend... You know my situation more than everyone and what I be feeling you share it with me, happiness and sadness, thank you... (FYI, I've never met him...) the power of gaming and the internet is really amazing... 

              I wanna thank as well my family, by that I mean my mom, my sister for supporting, truly backing me up and believing in me, thank you so much... the world would've been darker without both of you.
 

 

              That wraps it up then, It has been a... let’s just say a complicated decade for me 😀 and looking forward to where this journey called “life” will take me, I heard it can be a “difficult” one sometimes though, so I won’t step in carefree but only careful. Thank you for staying with me in this long read and as a reward here’s a virtual hug and my greatest “Thank you”. You deserve it because you took time out of your day to read a random text you saw and cared enough to complete it. Love you all and may the upcoming years be the greatest for y’all! Much love from me and be nice, sweet and friendly with others, from my experience I can strongly say that it’ll be hard to do so in a disturbed and disrupted world but I believe in the fact that it’ll only lead to the greatest reward of it all so be nice, do what you want and care about what YOU want first, no one is gonna live your life for you so that one that you won’t regret some stuff like I did.

20,"Warning: This is long, I’m on mobile, I’m starting with “I’ve always loved horses”. 

I’ve loved horses since I was 10, coming from a no-so great childhood as an only child on a farm, they were an escape for me. I decided very early on that I wanted to do “something” with horses for a living, that something ended up being training. 

When I was getting close to graduating high school, my parents pushed really hard for me to go to college. I didn’t want to go, I wanted to go work as an assistant trainer and start my life. However, I lost that battle and we compromised on an equine college. 

By the time I was ready to leave for college, I got some horrible news, my mom was diagnosed with terminal breast cancer. My relationship with my mom was never good, if you asked at the time I would tell you I hated her. I hated her most of my life, so it felt like karma to a spiteful 19yr old. 

I ended up going to college anyway, it was 3 hours away and I desperately needed a new start. I was incredibly motivated and determined to become a trainer, leveraging my equine major to my benefit. Coming in, I had a great attitude. I was doing what I loved most and following my dream, how many people get to do that? 

By sophomore year I was busy driving back and fourth from home to college to help take mom to chemo every week. As my mom got sicker, we became closer. She was a manic depressant my entire life, but it’s almost like the cancer was eating away at it. She was “normal” again and we developed the relationship I had always wanted. 

During this time I was still maintaining good grades on campus and doing really well at the barn (equine program). Horses continued to be my escape from reality and my happy place, they really helped with coping. I was doing so well that one of the riding professors wanted me to try out for the riding team. 

I happily tried out and got accepted on the novice team. I was elated, it was such a happy time for me! I was finally getting to know my mom without the mental illness in the way even though she was sick, I was doing well in college, and I had a bright future as a trainer. 

I was doing well on the riding team and the coach offered the chance to go to nationals and represent my college in my division. I was thrilled, immediately called my mom and we both sobbed on the phone. I truly felt like I was doing what I was supposed to in life. I even landed a summer job as an assistant trainer. 

My mom ended up in the hospital for 2 weeks mid-way through the 2nd semester of my sophomore year. I went home for about a week to be with her, we thought we were going to lose her. Luckily she pulled through, but not without more bad news. We found out that the cancer had spread to her brain. 

Some context on my mom’s cancer, her main tumor was discovered in her chest wall. It was only found because she developed tumors on her chest and they did a body scan. The tumor was the size of your fist and they couldn’t remove it. She tried experimental radiation, where they “targeted” it through lasers. Ultimately it didn’t work and during that time it spread to the other side of her body. 

When I returned to college from that trip, it was a lot harder to deal. I was angry and often finding myself having to stop riding because I was getting too emotional. I spent a lot of time with one specific riding instructor (riding team coach), crying to her about my moms situation. I really felt like I could lean on her for support. She would drop everything to listen to me and wouldn’t judge. 

It was getting harder to keep the positive attitude and cheery outlook at school. Since her diagnosis, she was determined to fight it. She never accepted “terminal” and in a way I didn’t either...or I didn’t grasp the reality of it. But with the brain tumors, it became all too real all at once. 

The semester was coming to an end and I’m getting closer to nationals. Nationals was directly after school ended for the year. It honestly was one of the only things I was looking forward to. It was a few weeks away when my riding coach asked me to come into her office. She asked me how my mom was doing, I told her in she was getting along, hasn’t “almost died” in a few weeks. I assumed that’s what she wanted to talk about. 

She looks at me dead in the eyes and goes “well, I’ve been thinking, with your mom dying...I’m not so sure it’s a good idea for you to go to Nationals”. I immediately think it’s because she’s worried that mom will pass while I’m there. I reassure her that it would mean a lot to my mom if I went and my mom would be gutted if I didn’t. My mom and I had this discussion many times. Besides, it’s only 2 days and she’s been pretty even. 

My coach continued “well, I just don’t think you’ll be in the right head space. Plus if your mom is about to die and you have to leave, we don’t have anyone to replace you and we wouldn’t place.” My stomach dropped, she was wasn’t concerned about me being there for my mom. She was concerned about my dying mom putting her team’s winnings at risk. 

Being a stupid 19yr old, I panicked because I wanted this so badly. I had been working so hard, practicing twice a day 4 days a week. I begged her to let me go. I had to promise her I wouldn’t talk to my mom and my dad wouldn’t tell me about how she is the entire week leading up to Nationals. The kicker, I wasn’t supposed to tell anyone about our conversation either. 

I was so gutted and I was such a mess. The one thing I was excited about was going to be taken away because my mother was dying. Something that was hard enough as it was. I sat in the parking lot of the barn bawling for what felt like hours. I will forever regret telling my mom what she said, she felt like my future was at risk because of her. God, I wish I could take that back.

I went to nationals and after my class I was so overwhelmed. I placed but I was so freaking angry I couldn’t contain it. I was hysterically crying and shaking. I know the other students thought it was because I didn’t win. But I was just so angry at my coach and myself. I immediately called my mom to talk to her, completely blowing off my coach. I told her I was so sorry and I never should have went. 

I spent the rest of the time crying in the stands sitting by myself. My coach came up to me crying saying she was proud of me. I couldn’t even look at her. WHY did I go? Why did I let this horrible woman treat me like that? This person I trusted and leaned on, tried to take what felt like everything away from me because of things out of my control. I felt so incredibly betrayed and used. 

My moms breast cancer ended up becoming triple negative and she died the following month. That awesome job as an assistant, I ended up getting fired because I was a mess. I had a massive melt down at the biggest horse show of the year and I was let go. I couldn’t look at horses or horse people the same after that. 

I spent the last 2 years at the college angry and secluded. I made a point to ignore that professor entirely, she even asked me if she did something wrong. I couldn’t muster up the courage to tell her because I think I’d just end up screaming. I switched majors my senior year and I’m glad I did. 

I don’t know if it’s because my mom died that I don’t feel the same about horses anymore, or if it’s how that coach treated me. Maybe both. But to this day, 7 years later it still gets to me. I tried to get back into training 4 years ago, did it for a year and I just felt like a mess. I hated the people, I was too emotional, I didn’t trust my own instincts anymore, and I haven’t rode much since. I get anxious anymore. 

I don’t “need” horses anymore. I’ve gone through lots of therapy and came to terms with most of my demons. Except this one. Sometimes I think about reaching out to her or the college to tell them everything. Maybe it’s unhealthy to pin my loss of passion on her and what she did. It’s hard to put into words how devastating it was to me and I regret not standing up for myself. 

I was so sure horses were going to be my life and I was willing to do anything to achieve my dreams. Including, subjecting myself to being horribly mistreated. If I could go back in time and give myself some advice, I think it would be to grow a pair.",31Dec2019,1

24,"Warning: This is long, I’m on mobile, I’m starting with “I’ve always loved horses”. 

I’ve loved horses since I was 10, coming from a no-so great childhood as an only child on a farm, they were an escape for me. I decided very early on that I wanted to do “something” with horses for a living, that something ended up being training. 

When I was getting close to graduating high school, my parents pushed really hard for me to go to college. I didn’t want to go, I wanted to go work as an assistant trainer and start my life. However, I lost that battle and we compromised on an equine college. 

By the time I was ready to leave for college, I got some horrible news, my mom was diagnosed with terminal breast cancer. My relationship with my mom was never good, if you asked at the time I would tell you I hated her. I hated her most of my life, so it felt like karma to a spiteful 19yr old. 

I ended up going to college anyway, it was 3 hours away and I desperately needed a new start. I was incredibly motivated and determined to become a trainer, leveraging my equine major to my benefit. Coming in, I had a great attitude. I was doing what I loved most and following my dream, how many people get to do that? 

By sophomore year I was busy driving back and fourth from home to college to help take mom to chemo every week. As my mom got sicker, we became closer. She was a manic depressant my entire life, but it’s almost like the cancer was eating away at it. She was “normal” again and we developed the relationship I had always wanted. 

During this time I was still maintaining good grades on campus and doing really well at the barn (equine program). Horses continued to be my escape from reality and my happy place, they really helped with coping. I was doing so well that one of the riding professors wanted me to try out for the riding team. 

I happily tried out and got accepted on the novice team. I was elated, it was such a happy time for me! I was finally getting to know my mom without the mental illness in the way even though she was sick, I was doing well in college, and I had a bright future as a trainer. 

I was doing well on the riding team and the coach offered the chance to go to nationals and represent my college in my division. I was thrilled, immediately called my mom and we both sobbed on the phone. I truly felt like I was doing what I was supposed to in life. I even landed a summer job as an assistant trainer. 

My mom ended up in the hospital for 2 weeks mid-way through the 2nd semester of my sophomore year. I went home for about a week to be with her, we thought we were going to lose her. Luckily she pulled through, but not without more bad news. We found out that the cancer had spread to her brain. 

Some context on my mom’s cancer, her main tumor was discovered in her chest wall. It was only found because she developed tumors on her chest and they did a body scan. The tumor was the size of your fist and they couldn’t remove it. She tried experimental radiation, where they “targeted” it through lasers. Ultimately it didn’t work and during that time it spread to the other side of her body. 

When I returned to college from that trip, it was a lot harder to deal. I was angry and often finding myself having to stop riding because I was getting too emotional. I spent a lot of time with one specific riding instructor (riding team coach), crying to her about my moms situation. I really felt like I could lean on her for support. She would drop everything to listen to me and wouldn’t judge. 

It was getting harder to keep the positive attitude and cheery outlook at school. Since her diagnosis, she was determined to fight it. She never accepted “terminal” and in a way I didn’t either...or I didn’t grasp the reality of it. But with the brain tumors, it became all too real all at once. 

The semester was coming to an end and I’m getting closer to nationals. Nationals was directly after school ended for the year. It honestly was one of the only things I was looking forward to. It was a few weeks away when my riding coach asked me to come into her office. She asked me how my mom was doing, I told her in she was getting along, hasn’t “almost died” in a few weeks.

I want you to know that I may be feeling like there’s a dark cloud over my head - like life wants to test my mettle - like it’s waves of an endless ocean that wash over me making me older and days blend together 

But that through all that one of the few sources of light I have is your smile and your laughter and your voice 

And that that’s never going to change

And that even when I’m faced with the insurmountable odds that are my own lack of will, or my own insecurities or my own shortcomings or shortcuts - you’re always the right path to take. 

I love you with everything that my heart has. It’s a lot. It’s dramatic and it’s impulsive and it’s made a lot of mistakes but it’s all for you and I hope you accept it as it is because as much as I want I can’t change how I feel right now. 

I want to be the incredibly fit, top of the world, leader that you deserve as a boyfriend and as a husband and you will get that and that is a promise

28,"I'm mentally ill. I have diagnosed Borderline Personality Disorder, as well as severe anxiety and depression. I'm not a danger to anyone, but I AM a bad romantic partner, and anyone who knows anything about BPD knows we can be manipulative and abusive.

I came here to the US seven years ago, after my ex-husband studied at university in my home country. He was so sweet and handsome, and he said he loved how passionate I was. He knew about my BPD and illnesses before we got serious. We did long-distance for six months after he graduated, and then he asked me to move to the US and marry him.

We live on the east coast, I like it here, we had a daughter together, I thought things were good.

Fast forward to last year, when he left me. I knew I wasn't easy to live with, but I never saw the divorce coming. He told me over dinner. I remember my first thought after denial, being ""well, I wish I had made something less time consuming instead of wasting this effort on him.""

He went to the court house and filed the next day, and another month later he moved out.

When he left he took our 4yo daughter with him. When he left he said he thought it was in her best interest that he had main custody, and he reasoned out why (my mood swings, selfishness, inability to see reason and logic, and general mental instability), so I agreed. It was all happening so fucking fast! I asked if we could please revisit custody arrangement down the road? He said yes. That was almost year ago and now he's denying ever having said that at all.

I see our daughter once a month, for an overnight visit. He suggested it, when I asked for every other weekend, he said maybe in another year when she had settled more into a routine.

Our daughter is very attached to me. She cried when he walked out of the house with her and I cried for her and had a bit of a mental breakdown, I checked myself into the hospital for suicide watch. My ex frequently likes to remind me of that. I dream of 50% custody, but I'm not well enough for that yet. When I threatened to go to court for an official custody schedule and 50%, my ex laughed in my face and said they'd never give that much custody to a crazy woman. He's kinda right. :(

He says I emotionally abused him, that I am too mentally unstable to be reliable, and I think he's right. I never think ""oh let me manipulate him to get my way!"" But when I get upset and want something, I'd argue to get it, for instance. I am not trying to say I am a victim in this. I don't know. I'm not disputing that I treated my ex badly.

So even if he isn't right and I could get 50% he's still kinda right. I'm not crazy, but my moods ARE unpredictable, sometimes I get very depressed out of the blue, sometimes I have no patience for anything and will get mad at objects in my house, like if internet cuts out I might get mad and yell at my phone. I don't have the energy to do a lot of stuff with her, take her to a trampoline park or out sledding or whatever. I often make sad meals now, Mac &amp; cheese cups, oatmeal, etc. I'm too tired to cook like I used to, so I can't feed her properly, and order out way more than I should.

I used to throw stuff when I was mad, but I stopped that when our daughter was like 18 months and she started picking up the same behavior during tantrums. She kept throwing stuff through toddlerhood though. My ex says stuff like that is proof I'm unfit mom. I honestly don't know if I did that to her and made her throw things, but I think my insecurity about it is what makes him right.

I miss her so much. It's like missing a limb. I can't talk to her or see her. If I text him, he responds with some variation of ""You can see her on your day, this is my day.""

I couldn't afford the rent on my own to our old place so now I live in a studio. I struggle to keep a job because of my mental illness, my attendance is always shit, I call off once a week. I've been freelancing as a writer and taking various odd jobs, mTurk, surveys, shoveling snow, whatever I can, but it's so hard. What little money I do have go to bills and my therapy and medicine. His job carried the health insurance, so now I don't have that. I've racked up a bunch of credit card debt and have no family here. My ex suggested I move back home if things got too hard, but I refuse to leave her. I refuse to give up. She's everything to me.

I feel like I'm worthless. I'm not going to kill myself, because I think my daughter needs me. Or maybe I just imagine that. But what kind of mother can't take care of her own child? Of herself? When she actually wants to? And also, what if I abuse her by putting to much on her? She's my everything - but that's probably not good for her.

I tried joining a support group for divorced moms but they all stared weird at me and one of them expressed discomfort over my presence, I think she might've been scared of me, and I was the only mom who didn't have at least 50%. I left the group cause I was tired of being stared at.

I wish I could just magically make myself cured. I wish I could wave a fucking wand and then PIFF! No more BPD, no more random crying, no more depression and anxiety. I'm so tired all the time, I'm so lonely.

I don't tell anyone I have a daughter anymore. They want to ask about her and it hurts so much to talk about this. I talk about it with my therapist instead. I hope she will not grow up thinking I'm ashamed of her.i just want to be a normal mom.

I'm sorry this is long and rambling.

The thing is that I have never had any hopes/dreams for the future and not to mention I really don't see myself living past my 20s.

I got a minimum wage job in late November. It's pretty OK I guess. I'm fine with the things are now, working part-time and staying at home without going to school. 

Everyone keeps telling me to go to college though. My older coworkers, my family, even random customers will talk about it with me during work. So I feel pretty pressured to go to college. I told my family I will go to community college in late 2020 at the earliest but to be honest, I don't want to go to college for the next 2 years at least.

My concern is that I really have no interest in anything at all, so I can't just get a degree in something I'd be interested in. I am not particularly good at anything, even following directions, so I can't get a degree in something I'm good at. Everyone else I know seems to know what they're going to do and are already in college/working towards it. All my friends are artists and a good number of them are going to art school or are already there. It seems I'm the only one who still doesn't know what to do.

*As an act of protest, I have chosen to redact all the comments I've ever made on reddit, overwriting them with this message. Reddit USED to be a place for every opinion, even the ugly ones to have a chance at discussing content. Unfortunately after being paid a lot of money, they no longer feel it necessary to protect open conversations but instead believe that censorship will produce a better site. Just ask yourself why SRS isn't banned, but FPH is banned? It is selective policing at best and as much as I am not a fan of those subreddits, I cannot remain a silent observer of such selective policing.""*

As someone who is widely supportive of free speech and actively tries to discuss uncomfortable and unpopular subjects to do my part in it, I think this person is doing it so right. I completely agree that reddit more and more is moving away from what made it great in the first place. OP did this 4 years ago, but I feel like it has gotten worse since.

There are multiple communities out there getting banned for racism, toxicity and hate speech, while other racist communities continue to thrive because the oppressor is of a different ethnicity. He summed it up perfectly: ***as much as I am not a fan of those subreddits, I cannot remain a silent observer of such selective policing.***

51,"We all know this feeling when we want to learn something new. We wait until motivation strikes us out of nowhere, then we tinker around for a few hours without a clear direction, checking notifications, and as soon as we realize that we’re not getting anywhere, we get discouraged and give up. Side note: if you wait for motivation, you’re doing it wrong. The formula to induce motivation, in my experience, starts with action, which sparks inspiration, which sparks motivation, which leads to action, and the loop continues.
We also know and have experienced the feeling of flow. The moment when you’re fully focused on a task. You lose all sense of time, and everything seems to flow effortlessly; you forget everything around you and have a feeling of control over the task. This rewarding feeling of flow is best described by Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi:

“The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.”

Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi

Why is it that this state of flow seems so arbitrary and rare, like something that we happen to stumble upon by mere coincidence? Why don’t we strive to create a state of flow as often as possible? After all, it is not only satisfying, but also very productive and yields positive rewards. The reason we rarely reach this state is that we constantly need to remind ourselves that we live in a world full of distractions. And sometimes it is difficult to press the pause button.
To create a state of flow, one must follow certain rules and embrace deliberate practice through a concept called deep work. In order to produce the absolute best results you’re capable of, you need to commit to deep work. The key to developing the ability for deep work is to move beyond good intentions and add routines and rituals designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition from a distracted state into a state of stable concentration. The rule of thumb is that it takes approximately 25 minutes of focus without distraction to reach a state of flow. If you’re checking your Twitter notifications every 20 minutes, which seems harmless, you prevent your brain from reaching that state and therefore prolong the time required to complete your task.
The Law of Productivity: High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)
Don’t make the mistake of confusing productivity with busyness. Doing lots of stuff in a visible manner does not mean you’re being productive. Most of what we do is Shallow Work:

“Shallow Work: Non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.”

“Professional activities performed in a state of distraction free concentration that push your cognitive ability to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skills, and are hard to replicate. Deep work is hard and shallow work is easier and in the absence of clear goals for your job, the visible busyness that surrounds shallow work becomes self-preserving.”
Cal Newport
Deliberate practice cannot exist alongside distraction. You get better at a skill as you develop more myelin around relevant neurons, allowing the corresponding circuit to fire more effortlessly and effectively. Therefore, to be good at something is to be well myelinated. Through deliberate practice and by focusing on a specific skill, you’re forcing the specific circuit relevant to that skill to fire, again and again, in isolation. This repetitive process triggers cells called oligodendrocytes to start wrapping layers of myelin around the neurons in the circuits, which in turn effectively strengthens the skill.

Ok. This all makes a lot of sense, but I can tell from experience that simply knowing these things won’t put you any closer to your goal. I’ve read an entire book on Deep Work and the biggest lesson I learned when trying to implement Deep Work into my daily/weekly schedule is that if you don’t plan it carefully and make it a strong habit, you will fail to develop this skill and automatically fall back to unproductive tinkering. After all, you have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it. As it turns out, we all have approximately 4 hours of willpower available each day. Trying to force yourself to finally get started while procrastinating is exactly where your willpower gets depleted in the most unproductive way. If you have a fixed plan, a habit, you save your willpower for the actual task.

Another important lesson I’ve learned is that practice != deliberate practice. Deliberate practice refers to a special type of practice that is purposeful, systematic, and stretches your mind to its limits. Regular practice might include mindless repetitions of the same task, while deliberate practice requires focused attention and is performed with the specific goal of improving performance. The natural tendency of the human brain is to transform repeated behaviors into automatic habits. The more we repeat a task the more mindless it becomes. Mindless activity is the enemy of deliberate practice. Behavioral psychologist James Clear confirms,

“Too often, we assume we are getting better simply because we are gaining experience. In reality, we are merely reinforcing our current habits — not improving them.”
James Clear
We all have the capacity to improve our performance in any area of life if we train our brain in the correct way.  This is easier said than done. Let’s be straight here. Deliberate practice is not a comfortable activity and it requires sustained effort and focus. It is basically the process of failing, over and over again, because through failure we know that we have stretched our limits. Take lifting weights as an example. You lift weights until you fail and have to take a break, which is exactly where your body learns to expand its current limits and prepare to be stronger the next time you perform this activity. Force yourself to take on challenges that are beyond your limits. Pick a project that forces you to learn new concepts and techniques. When you read a scientific paper, systematically look up the words and concepts you don’t understand rather than discarding it with a “I don’t understand half of it anyway” attitude.

When performance psychologists began to explore what separates experts, in many different fields, from everyone else, the single coherent answer was: deliberate practice. Our culture loves the story line of the prodigy and the notion that experts posses a inherent talent that separates them from everyone else. But in reality, to master a cognitively demanding task requires this specific form of practice. There are only a few exceptions made for natural talent. K. Anders Ericsson introduced the concept of deliberate practice in his 1993 paper “The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance“, where he stated:

“we deny that these differences are immutable, that is, due to innate talent. Only a few exceptions, most notably height, are genetically prescribed. Instead, we argue that the differences between expert performers and normal adults reflect a life-long period of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain.”

You need to choose a strategy/philosophy that fits your specific circumstances, as a mismatch can derail your deep work habit before it has a chance to solidify. Here are some strategies I extracted from the book Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World:

Monastic: “This philosophy attempts to maximize deep efforts by eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligations.” — isolate yourself for long periods of time without distractions; no shallow work allowed.
Bimodal: “This philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else.” – dedicate a few consecutive days (like weekends, or a Sunday, for example) for deep work only, at least one day a week.
Rhythmic: “This philosophy argues that the easiest way to consistently start deep work sessions is to transform them into a simple regular habit.” – create a daily habit of three to four hours every day to perform deep work on your project.
Journalistic: “in which you fit deep work wherever you can into your schedule.” — Not recommended to try out first, since you first need to accustom yourself to deep work.
For my current lifestyle, I prefer to switch between the Rhythmic and the Bimodal. You don’t have to fit on one box, but you can use these strategies as reference points when developing one that fits your circumstances.

“But I don’t know which topic to focus on”
Fair enough. It’s difficult to know in advance what could become “your thing”, since our interests vary from person to person and only because I like ARM exploit development, doesn’t mean it is something you would enjoy doing yourself.

Here’s an idea:

Pick a skill that can be useful to your current path
If you don’t have a path yet, pick a skill that is generally useful or one that you could potentially transform into a career.
Give it a try for minimum 30 hours (deep work!). You might not like it at first. Don’t get discouraged right away. Things we’re not good at are scary and we don’t like doing what we suck at. The trick is to overcome the initial frustration until you get your first rewarding experiences.
Split your 30 hours into seven 4-hour sessions (plus buffer). Set clear goals of what you want to accomplish with this project. Remember, the goal is not to become a master within 30 hours but to use your time efficiently to learn enough so you can judge if you want to continue or switch to another subject.

Use your first session to perform extensive information gathering. Look at the resources available to you and pick the ones that stick out as the most useful for completing the project you’ve chosen. If necessary, use the second session to set up the environment (e.g. an analysis environment for Malware analysis including all tools you could possibly need for your first analysis) and define clear goals (e.g. Analyze Malware x). It is important to set clear goals and split them into structured parts.

If you complete two sessions per week, you’ll be done in 3 weeks. Worst case scenario: You realize that you don’t like it, but you have spent 30 hours learning something challenging and new that you wouldn’t have otherwise learned. Best case: You realize that this is actually fun and want to continue it. Having already started, you overcame the most annoying part and can now happily continue.",31Dec2019,1

62,"My fiance and I got to know each other through discord last year in October. I had just moved to Pakistan from the yhe Netherlands in the summer of 2018. Him and i were initially e-dating other people which we helped each other to get with btw but those relationships both went south. We started out as friends but soon enough started speaking about more intimate stuff with each other (e.g. Sex) in which one thing lead to another and boom before i knew it i was head over heels in love. I was occasionally flirting with him even though i knew he had a girlfriend, i felt incredibly guilty cuz his at the time girlfriend messaged me asking me to stay away from him but I was quite wreckless. (My fiance and I were both mentally unwell as we've had to withstand a lot of shit throughout our lives so at some point his parents wanted to send him to a clinic for addiction and mental health). On a daily basis he would message me saying how in love he was with his back then girlfriend and this would confuse me cuz sometimes he also flirted with me but as i was also seeing someone else i knew i shouldn't get these feelings i had for him get any stronger. However my back then boyfriend and i ended up breaking up and somehow i managed to convince my fiance to break up with his gf too. We started dating the same day he broke up with her. Near the end of November he had to go to the clinic for 10 weeks and my unstable ass was scared to get get hurt cuz i thought he'd find someone better and wouldn't love me anymore so i tried to push him away by breaking up with him just before he went to the clinic. Fast forward 10 weeks, he's back from the clinic but my mental health haf worsened, he strongly suggested that I'd also go to the clinic he went to. After discussing it with my parents I went there too about a month after he came back. (He saved my life by doing this. If i had not gone to the clinic back then, I'd guarunteed be dead now). During this time we had gotten back together but once again as i was gonna be away from him my insecurities got the best of me again and i broke up with him. Once i got back again (in March) summer was approaching, i still liked him a lot and he liked me too so we decided to jump back into our relationship where we left off. In the summer my family went back to the Netherlands and as Marvin (my now fiance) and I were also still best friends we decided to meet up. This was our first time meeting each other in real life. I was nervouse as hell, i made sure to wear a cute dress. I took the train to where he lives and i was getting more and more nervous with each passing second. Once i arrived at the train station, i scanned the place for about 20 seconds and then we spotted eachother. I gave him a hug and we went to the cinema to watch Aladdin, i really enjoyed cuddling up to him and could tell he was nervous too. Basically we had classic first date with a twist cuz we went to McDonald's after to get some food where i embarrassed myself :) this was in the beginning of June, a week or 2 later I started to realise that this was the first real life relationship i was in in which i was actually loved and also genuinely loved back, this freaked me out and I once again backed out. I was starting to get pissed with myself because i knew that if i i kept doing this I'd lose him yet at the same time my dumbass thought that if i hurt him enough to push him away now it'll hurt less then if it were to happen in the future. Which is fucking bullshit of course but i refused to see it until i reflected on myself some. My rationalization as to why it went wrong was that we kept rushing into things so i told him I'd rather stay friends for a bit first and then slowly see where things take us so on the 14th of July we decided to give this relationship another go and since then things have been going really well. 

This young man has proved to me time and time again that he loves me and i really hope i do the same for him. He makes me so happy, i love every little thing about him. How understanding he is, the great listener in him, the kind heart he has, the humour he shares with me, his hopes and dreams, he makes me wanna live my life and really make the best out of it. 

My darling Marvin, I'm so grateful that you've flown all the way to Pakistan to visit me, I'm grateful for your patience with me and with time, I'm grateful for all the smiles you've put on my fave and grateful for the tears i was allowed to share with you. You've opened my soul to a whole new world and i cannot believe I'm the lucky person who gets to explore it with you. We've been through hell and back and each time we've only made it out strongly. I'm so impeccably proud of you, you make the world a better place. You give me a life that's worth living. I'm so haply to be your fiance and am still in slight disbelief that I'm actually going to be your wife. God did right by you baby. I love you. ❤️",31Dec2019,1

66,"Your ID number as an awareness defines the experience of its reality. 

The only reason you are in this reality is by the programming you designed as the perception. 

Before the experience of existence within the distance of the time designed you were an absence of awareness which in its position as itself. 

The specific lack of existence as you in the oblivion exactly the same  as meditation, then reduced the distinctions of itself as nothing to less then nothing, forming into the now of after causality. 

In the position even with your eyes open of constant void and stillness, exists repetition of static that as void of the complete existence of being, reduces into patterns tuned by recognition. 

So even when staring at something or anything beyond something as we know it, the natural pattern of existing reduces to the causality that begins with the pattern intended by observation. 

In our own disregard of the patterns we cannot find or locate, by localized navigation being equal in determined or controlled nature. It means the actions of ourself perception are caused by us as tuned from the higher body outside and inside yourself being now.

Irrelevant of where or what that being is, it is as it is, by self intended manifest of its continued repeated and changing state. 

So the person you see not yourself, acts firstly in themselves and what they do amoung yourself is equalized compatible nature at the extent of your underlying plot pre written as you, by both parties matched collapse of reality. 

Any plot pre written is changed by direct access to the desire to change it, plus the honesty of yourself. Which then repositions reality through logical returns to the point of both and optionally desired or undesired null. 

I like suffering and hell sometimes, so I sometimes regress to less then sense and cohesive structural reality like that of people for my own pleasure. 

I do this simply by dislocating the meaning from my thinking process and staring at things while lacking my own intended capacity to understand or be anything but vapid nonsense. 

Usually after complaining about my fears and then masterbation cause why not. I ended up here from too much of a taste for hellish things as my other hobby.

Inusually spend time fixing problems and going on philosophical scientific adventures through the multiverse when not a pile of nonsense. 

Cause I just do what I want with what I want and reach in the programs of my identity amoung others I can coexist with.

Cause coexisting is more fun for everyone.

So it really is what you defined as you began right now and then what you work to modify amoung any option. 

Death is just a repositioning of your awareness to null unawareness that decoheres back into its intended identity, of continued numbering as itselfs code. 

I just modify my point of existence as the material fact of myself perceiving me and change its orientation in the interfaces of myself. 

So that I decohere in intended manner to my desired collapsed point of selection in reach of my current intents. 

Although sometimes I do wonder if others like thinking or decoherence to this idea if deep identity sourcing of themselves. 

It's done in changing the reality in nearest range of the exact desire as possible as soon as intended. 

I thought I would just let you know, if you forgot or chose otherwise or beyond in possibility of reality selected. 

Cause I like talking about it and enjoy a custom narrative of my navigated collapses as a story. 

Its okay if I sound absolutely crazy and irrational for thinking I can do anything I try to do as instantly as I manage. It is crazy and I am very random. 

Also I am a dog deman and not a human.

But today at this one spot the water was up to the wall, I hesitated for a bit and even took a [photo](https://imgur.com/a/EfzU9dg) before, but I decided to just sprint through the wet part.

I was wearing my bluetooth headphones and as I sprint the song stops and to my horror I notice the phone in my pocket has fallen out. I rush back and the song comes back on, but no phone, the waves  immediately carried it somewhere else. The song I was listening to (Black Breath- Escape From Death) was cutting on and off. I panic as I figure I only have a few more seconds before it dies and I run back and forth next to the wall trying to spot it in the crashing waves. At one point it went silent and I had time to curse 2019 and every god known to man. Then I walk a few more steps and the song fucking comes back on. So I figure it's deeper in somewhere and I rush into knee deep water, it's 4 degrees outside, and I try and feel it between the rocks with Black Breath's hardcore punk still blasting in my ears so I am sort of able to pinpoint its location. Like a mad man I desperately splash around in ice cold water till to the point I'm about to freeze and give up. So I start walking back to the shore and just then I see it washed back next to wall. 

I quickly pick it up and the son of a bitch is just fine, like nothing happened. So I turn it off just in case and run home as fast as I can. Wiped it clean of seawater and sand and left it to dry out. Later turned it back on and it works like nothing happened, not even sensing any moisture. 

I was pretty happy with the phone before and if you are looking for a new phone I can say the Oneplus 7 can withstand crashing icecold seawater for at least 5 minutes. 

Pretty neat end for 2019 and hope you all have a terrific 2020!",31Dec2019,1
85,"What if modern technology is messing with our health? Homo Sapiens Sapiens have evolved across 200,000 years and things started to significantly change just 10,000 years ago with agriculture. My thesis is: a huge % of health problems are related to modern behaviors humans are not adapted to.

My conviction about this has increased after applying it to the first and most basic thing: what we eat and what we drink. I went to prehistoric times in terms of ""things I put in my body"" and now I do a ketogenic diet based on meat fish, nuts but not dairy or other processed food neither fruits (genetically modified by agriculture to increase carbs content). Of course, caffeine, alcohol and other drugs are not natural, and used to mess my brain causing insomnia, depression, infections etc and I just drink water. After 2 months, I naturally gravitated towards OMAD (one meal a day) because hunger only appeared once a day and if I ate twice, I suffered from reflux. It has been an amazing improvement: far better sleep and aparently no more bruxism, far less depressive symptoms, better mood, no more IBS, sugar and alcohol cravings eliminated, I can see my abs, my vision has improved... It's such a simple thing, to change what you eat makes a huge difference at all levels.

So, I eat in a natural way (except for olive oil, olives and vinegar, all is a natural unprocessed product made by Evolution), the way humans are adapted to eat and I got healthier as fuck.

On the other hand, I've realized that, the more I stay at home, in front of a screen, the more depressed and anxious I get; but if I go outside and see ancient trees in natural spaces, I feel far better. Another argument in favor or my thesis...

The more I know, the more I realize humans have created a ton of bullshit to get profit, things that make us sick and depressed. Evolution may be superior to human cognition in the most fundamental ways. I mean, wtf, we live in cities filled with toxic air, noise, buildings reducing sunlight exposure, concrete everywhere and very few trees, processed food everywhere, people looking at smartphones most of the times like methheads, stupid ads making us feel inferior for not having money... Do we really have to ask why are we more depressed?",31Dec2019,1
86,"This is like a confession with a bunch of built-up bullshit I need to get off my chest. 

When I was 14, I was on a lot of psych meds. More than a tiny 14 yr old girl should be. The list is in the 40s, would be taking 10 or so at any given time (never even had a diagnosis other than ""depression""). To be brief, I was not the same after mentally and physically. I developed epilepsy, thyroid problems, etc. I stopped taking them when I turned 18.. and surprise surprise, nothing happened. If anything, I got *better*. I was actually mentally functional. 

Now, I am supposed to be taking lamictal (as well as vitamin D, singulair, gabapentin, I think a few others). I stopped it. I feel no different on or off it. I feel like when I'm taking it, it's just a way for doctors to just shut me up like ""well we have you on meds and it seems to be working"". They wouldn't up my lamictal because the blood test says it's in therapeutic range, and nothing else worked. 

It's been about 2 months without any meds, and I'm fine. Well ehhh, not exactly fine but same as when I was on them. I don't have grand mal seizures, my EEGs come up clear. But I can feel something is off. Everyday I get the feeling I'm high on nitrous. As fun as it would seem to feel naturally high, it gets in the way of work and makes me unable to drive (till now.. going to be cleared in 2 weeks since no doctors believe me about my problems so fuck it, I'll get cleared and take learning to drive slow and at my pace). 

But of course, the doctors brush all these symptoms off as ""well.. you're just.. like that"". And I've been to *a lot* of doctors. 

So if I'm the same off the meds as on, and the doctors don't seem to give a flying fuck, what's the point? 

On top of that, I also have high cholesterol, occasional chest and other mysterious pains. Surprise, surprise.. Drs don't say much about that either (maybe because I'm 105 lbs so it's not like they can say ""lose some weight, go on a diet"" to someone who eats less than 1,000 calories a day because of my literal non-existent appetite). 

My biggest thing is my medication history. I was on lithium, depakote, enough benzos to sedate an obese elephant all before 18, and all combined together. Never had epilepsy or anything before that, nor does it run in the family. I would suppose doctors would be like ""well, now, that's not good for a 14 yr old and it's super suspicious how your first seizure was caused by a benzo withdrawal.."" (my psych took me off Ativan cold turkey, my dumbass didn't know the dangers nor did they advise my mom of any dangers). But nope. They all act like it's fucking normal to drug up a tiny child like it's no one's business. I don't even think it's epilepsy, neither does my doctor. Going one final time to get my clearance to drive and to ask ""if you don't think it's epilepsy, how do we find out what it is?"" And if she doesn't have an answer, I'm done wasting my time. 

So fuck the meds. Fuck them pretending to ""help"" me. I'm throwing in the towel. Going to the hematologist one final time to find out what I'm going to be ignoring (from the tests I got over the portal, seems to be anemia and iron deficiency by idk the thyroid results), and that's it.",31Dec2019,1
88," 

Here's the summary:

I'm 32, I'm now working a boring dead-end job, I earn just enough to pay the bills and food, and that's about it. I'm wondering if I shouldn't go back to live with my parents because should I get laid off or something happen, I'm in the street.

I tried to attain three different diplomas, marketing, nursing and plumbing. I failed all three of them, I studied hard but I'm a bit slow and dumb when it comes to comprehension and learning, I also got laid off at previous job that required a bit of thinking, I can do the simple tasks but more complicated stuff is not something I would trust myself with. I always dreamt about writing books, I did so for over ten years  and took classes too. But I do have some sense of self-critic, a decade of training and writing every evening is just plain bad, I had to gave up, it was disheartening to witness what I could not do.

I never had a girlfriend or even friends, I have trouble communicating. I can do jokes and sarcasm pretty well, but that's it. Whenever I try to  have a deeper conversation or talk about a precise subject, I bore the other people and they just leave at the first occasion. I followed advice to make friens like going to clubs I like and social clues, but  to no avail.

I also went to therapy for 7 years for the same issues, it felt good talking about it, but I'm not sure it helped either.

Now, every morning when I look into the mirror, the only thing that awaits me is a boring job, with no friends or dreams or people to look forward too, and there's barely anything that brings me joy.

And I wonder, what's the fucking point of life if despite my efforts, I still live like this?",31Dec2019,1

132,"Hey everybody,

My life itself has always been pretty good, but my quality of life has been awful for the last 8-ish years. I am currently 23, and this is a quick timeline of what's been going on:

* Age 13-14, started experiencing general anxiety for no apparent reason. Also, felt stressed a lot for no real reason either. Doctor thought it might be anxiety/depression so suggested I see a therapist and try some antidepressants. I tried a couple antidepressants and saw a therapist with no success. Antidepressants did absolutely nothing, and therapist was at a loss as to how to help. This generalized anxiety/worry/stress feeling continued.
* Age 16, while still dealing with the above, I woke up one day after a good night's sleep and felt a little tired. I attributed it to anxiety or stress from school, but it NEVER went away. But it was very mild, so I just let it go and tried making lifestyle changes with no success. Over the months and years, it has very gradually worsened to the point where I'm at now where I can hardly function due to the overwhelming fatigue/brain fog. It is 24/7. Not even a second of feeling better.
* Age 17-present: Have had nearly every sort of medical testing one can have done, many of them multiple times. Food allergy, vitamin/mineral deficiencies, thyroid, testosterone, heavy metals, MRI, EEG, EKG, Lyme disease, Epstein Barr, h pylori, sleep apnea, dietary changes, sleep schedule changes, increase exercise, etc. Have tried a total of 7 different antidepressants/anxieties from different drug classes to see if maybe depression was the culprit. All either did nothing or made me more tired/foggy. I’ve tried Vyvanse, Adderall, Ritalin, kratom, CBD, kava, and countless other supplements. The stimulants all either helped very slightly, but felt very artificial and made my body more anxious but didn’t help my mind, or didn’t do anything. Caffeine in any form doesn’t help either. I’ve seen 3 different psychologists, all of whom were baffled and said they did not know how to help me and have never heard of this before relative to mental health issues. 

I feel this intense dissociation feeling 24/7 that has gradually emerged/worsened over the past couple of years. Like I'm so tired, I don't even feel like I'm in real life ever anymore. I feel drunk/drugged, especially as the day progresses. Come 8 PM, I feel so spaced out, the fatigue is unbearable. Sometimes, I feel so tired I feel physically ill. The gradual cognitive decline is shocking (Concentration, alertness, memory, focus, processing/recalling/stumbling over words and sentences, confusion, etc.). My motor skills have also declined badly as well. I bump into things, my reflexes are awful, I miss things when I try and grab them, etc. I feel dizzy/lightheaded when I stand up after sitting or laying down. I now have very low arousal. It's almost impossible to startle me. It's like my body doesn't even process loud noises or scare anymore. I feel anxious/stressed/overwhelmed more easily. Everything feels like a chore, like an ordeal I get to check off. Even if it is something extremely minor or something fun. Decision making is poor, even for relatively minor things. Hypersomnia (Usually fall asleep very easily, rarely have insomnia). Vision has declined (eye floaters, spots, light sensitivity). Eyes are dry/watery off and on. Numbness all over body. Tough to explain, but extremities/body parts feel so utterly exhausted and numb-like to the touch. Like I can feel my arm getting touched by my hand, but can’t feel my hand touching my arm. Senses feel dulled (Hearing, taste, smell, touch) all feel weakened and suppressed, especially as the day goes on and I feel more tired. Sex drive is virtually non-existent. Alcohol hits me much harder now. As a result, I feel intoxicated more easily/quickly. Sometimes 1 beer and I'm already feeling really drunk. I’m slow now both mentally and physically. Head almost always feels very tired and heavy, but I don't get headaches that often. I yawn way too much. Anhedonia and apathy as I’ve gotten tireder and tireder. I have gradually become indifferent to most things. I literally come across like an emotionless zombie now because I am so damn exhausted 24/7. Almost nothing phases or interests me anymore. I feel like I get every cold/flu virus that comes around. And it takes me much longer to get over them. I am emotionally flat lined. One of my eyelids droops a little bit, mostly later in the day and/or when I’m more tired. I feel like I need lots of sleep to “recover”, but all sleep really does is reset me a little bit and is very unrefreshing. All of these symptoms seem to be worse when I’m sick, stressed, get less sleep, etc.

Overall, it feels like I was hit by a truck. From the moment I wake up to the moment I pass out from sheer exhaustion at night. Everything feels like it's suppressed by this fog that has gradually gotten worse over time. For example, caffeine’s effect, sex drive, post-workout adrenaline and endorphins, getting plenty of sleep, etc. I can sort of FEEL all these things for the most part, but it feels hidden and pushed down from this utter exhaustion. It’s like nothing can surpass the fatigue and fog. It's gotten to the point where I feel like I'm living my life from the backseat and am just going through the day mindlessly on autopilot. It literally gives me anxiety and depression to feel like this and not know why, and watch my life just pass me by at the same time. And the thing that sucks is that I WANT to do things and live life, and am still pretty optimistic, but I'm just too out of it, it's embarrassing. I come across like a drugged zombie when I try.

Realistically, the last kind of test I can do at this point is a sleep study, which is in a few weeks. In a way, sadly, I hope they find something. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",31Dec2019,1

My journey with reddit started about two years ago, when I stumbled upon a walking dead game subreddit. It didnt take long until I started diving more into reddit as a whole. I became addicted, and still am. I can spend over 5 hours daily just scrolling the front page. And its not like those hours just go by without me noticing it - I feel time go by and its uterrly mundane. Yet I struggle to close the app until Im either hungry/have work to do/realize its 3am.

Ive had some breaks from reddit before, and it always felt refreshing. 

Thats my resolution for this new day, new year, new decade and a new chapter of my life - I want to make every day count. I will not let myself waste any more opportunities.

Goodbye to you all. Though as a whole Reddit was a waste of time, I must admit people here made me smile more than once.

A year ago I got my very first job, abroad, in Canada. I did it all by myself and moved alone: no family, no friends.

Rented my first place myself alone! - failed, rented new great place
I wasn't promoted because couldn't stand up for myself - improved and expecting promotion in January
Couldn't feel a thing - went to psychiatrist
Left all my friends from uni in my old country - found several new friends in Canada and realized I am okay!
Didn't know why should I live - started to read books about existentialism
Wasn't close to my mom, felt very lonely - started to dance, play tennis, sing in a choir, meditate, drawing, running and so on
Fell in love for the first time - still didn't do anything about it...

I am form the country where New Year is a main celebration so I wanted to sum up my year and actually whole life.
I am still not sure what to do next but I will work on it. I know I can survive and I know I will do it myself.

When I was 22, I was about to jump off the edge of a ferry  that I was on. I put my hands on the edge, looked down and thought, just one more step and it's all over. Then my mom came to mind and I took a step back. Maybe if she hadn't crossed my mind, I would have jumped.

The same way it happens today. Today, at New Years Eve, I'm having suicidal thoughts. I can't get them out of my mind and I haven't stopped crying since morning. 

I'd like to talk, but I know it's bullshit that everyone is available to listen to you. And maybe the one I want to be heard is not interested.

144,"Afraid to go to the few close people I have because it would be challenging to explain the whole situation.

I'm in a poly relationship, but my FWB has recently been acting suicidal – they tried calling me last night which has never happened. I thought it was a butt dial, but I was concerned so I followed up and started messaging them. They said I was the only person they could talk to. I recently had shared that I feel like an imposter in my own life (like I'm just crappy versions of all the roles I'm supposed to be) and that sometimes I feel like everyone would be better off without me, so obviously I'm struggling with similar issues.

I don't know the best way I can support this person, other than emphasizing that they can talk to me, but now I'm struggling with guilt that I can't support them as much as I would want to, because I have so many people in my life depending on me everyday, and I can't just drop what I'm doing and help them.

They are unwilling to see a therapist or call a hotline or anything, they just feel hopeless in their current situation.

I don't even know their family and they don't have social media so I don't have any way to contact people in their life.

They've become a really good friend (I'd be fine without the ""benefits""), and I just want to support them in any way I can, but I don't know if I'm doing a disservice to them by not being able to drop everything else in my life to do so.",31Dec2019,1
145,"So, this year really has not been great. From difficulties at work, to being on break with the girl I love the most, to my car getting totaled, I'd really like to put this year behind me. I'm hoping that writing this will help me move past the feelings I have and will, in turn, make me more appreciative of the things that do go my way in 2020.

The absolute most gut-wrenching thing this year has been the end of a four and a half year relationship that is currently on a break. She constantly asked me to get on anti-depressants and I've only made half-hearted attempts, but now that she's gone I'm realizing just how bad things were. I'm scared at this point it's too little too late, but if nothing else I need to get over my depression that has defined my 2010s. There's a lot of things I want to say to her; 

- why do you only call me when it's work related?

- why do you blow me off even though you want to get through this?

- why do I always have to text you first?

- why does this break have to be 6 months to a year?

We've been going to counselling together twice a month in addition to me seeing my therapist once a month, but somehow I still feel like I'm not making enough progress, even though they both say I am. I think I'm just truly afraid of losing her, and all the advice is basically telling me to just accept that fact and focus on yourself, and that she'll come back. Somehow I'm having a harder time doing that than I thought I would.

I don't know. I'm just lost. I'm without my best friend or plans for NYE, I don't like the job I'm at but her parents pay well and they really appreciate me even if we're not together, and I just feel like breaking down half the time and getting angry the other half of the time. I fucking hate 2019, but I don't think all the pain is going to magically disappear tomorrow. I just want someone to realize that yes I'm struggling but I'm important.

She asked me what she can possibly do to make things easier on me while we're apart, because she doesn't want to come home and she's closed herself off emotionally to me, and I think I've figured a few things out.

- Let me take care of you when you get sick. You may not do that for me but it's important to me to take care of those I care about.

- Make time for me. I get that we've spent several days together and just hung out and watched tv, played board games, and gone for walks, but that all feels like stuff that you want to do. I like hiking, video games, music, and food. Maybe we could do something that I want to do?

Look, I don't want people to get the impression that she's a bad person. She's an incredibly patient person who has given her all and that has come back to really hurt her in ways I didn't initially see (her severe weight gain, her anxiety being through the roof, afraid of what mood I'll be in when she comes home), but I can't help feeling this loneliness and everything I read is just telling me to embrace it. Some days have been better, but today isn't one of them.

I'm thinking about writing my thoughts out every day for a week or two here and seeing if that helps me straighten things out. For anybody who has been through something similar, I open your advice with open arms.",31Dec2019,1

151,"I really need help sorting out my romantic life(or lack thereof). I have no idea how to start.

When I[M20] was about 13, I genuinely became convinced that I was never going to make romantic connections. I attributed this to the endless years of fighting I endured at home. But at the time, I was in therapy for anxiety/depression anyway so I had bigger issues to overcome. At 16, I was proved wrong, when I made my first real connection with someone. The short version of this is that both me and (unbeknownst to me) my close friend both liked her. She was torn and went with him because “he was just more”, which was a phrase that really cut me open.

Somehow, working through that pain also helped me kill my social anxiety. I still had feelings for the girl, but I persisted. Eventually I even met a new girl. I wasn’t physically attracted to her, but she came from a similar family situation and looking back, I only cared about her because I finally felt understood. The short story of that is that after several months of her self harm threats, I had to basically manipulate her into breaking up with me. Still, I had panic attacks that one day she’d kill herself and it’d be my fault. I never wanted to be in that place ever again.

After that, I changed a bit. I told people I stopped looking for relationships, but only so that nobody pressured me to find one. It’s been two years since then.
 
Now I’m 20 years old. I’ve made good use of my time being single. I have so many good people and things in my life. I mean things are really great. But the one thing I’m struggling to do is date again.

When I look in the mirror, the person I see staring back is a good guy. But not someone anyone is interested in as a boyfriend. I feel really good about myself, just not good enough for someone to date.

I’ve downloaded apps twice and both times I got sickened by the idea of displaying any pictures of myself. All the wrong angles, all the wrong smiles, all the wrong poses. I’d promptly delete them.

I hardly ever meet any girls I’m interested in in person either. I know the personal and physical qualities I like and I just have trouble finding them. And the very few times I have, I just think “there’s no way I’m what she’s looking for”.

Like I said my life is great. I wake up every morning feeling like enough for myself. I have great things happening at work, and socially. My family is more united than ever. I have a full life. I’d just really like a girl to enjoy all these things with, and I don’t know where to go from my current point. I feel completely powerless to this one aspect of my life.",31Dec2019,1

it's honestly just been...an accumulation, i guess, of all the hurt i went through because of this certain friend. we've been friends for years now so that's probably what made it hard for me to remove myself from our friendship. i've endured it for long thinking we've had a long history between us that would be wasted if i just stopped being friends with her. but near the end of october to december of 2019 was really the tipping point. 

halloween. we planned to go together to an event since probably like, september and even planned our outfits but the night before came, she suddenly says she can't go because she's reached her quota of going out late at night (because she stayed out late the same night). the next day, she calls us out of nowhere while we were getting ready in another friend's house and says she suddenly wants to go. and we were like, um sure but you don't have a costume? it took us a long time to help her decide on a costume we can bring her since she was being picky (because those not wearing one aren't allowed in the club). then she kept calling to make us hurry in leaving the house because apparently her other officemates were starting leave and she didn't have anybody else. plus, she's some of the most impatient people i've met.

once we get to our meeting place, she says she doesn't want the clothes we brought and proceeded to make us go around with her to find another costume in the mall. last minute. so okay, we find her a costume in around 30 minutes. 

when we get to the club, she then informs us that she'll leave quickly to go to her crush in another club then come back immediately to us. she's drunk a few shots then. we tried to convince her to not leave anymore since we already planned this since before and that it might be dangerous for her but she said she'll only take a while. 

she didn't.

she didn't come back until we were calling her again and again by the time we were leaving the club. 

it was only recently that i realized she might have used us as an excuse to go party up with her crush without having to tell her mother.

early november, we were contacted for a paid project that pays so big, it would be enough to buy not one, but probably 3 vip concert tickets. so i was the one talking with the company since they reached out to me and negotiated all the details with them. she was our team's assigned editor, i was the camera person + the person who gets our offers, and our other friend was the person with the car who drives us to places we can film (which was a very tiring and expensive bec of gas job). we agreed we'll finish everything by the end of november and split the money between all of us equally. 

however, it seems i was the only who was trying to make the project work. she rarely replied and barely checked our messages despite us tagging her. it was so embarrassing because every time the company messages us, it takes so long for us to decide on things and compose a reply because they barely responded, especially her. then come our scheduling of the filming, we've had to move schedules to a friday because apparently, that works better for her so she can rest on the weekends. i understood her so we agreed to her proposal.

come friday, filming day, she complains about looking too haggard to be filmed on camera. and the whole time i was trying to take footages of her or us as a group, she was looking at her goddamn phone messaging her crush. and even wasted our time having to meet with said crush not once, but TWICE on the same night. imagine how tired we are. it was honestly so frustrating that i had footages of me sounding annoyed already because she wouldn't cooperate that night. she was the one scheduled the filming day. she should've been ready and fixed her makeup or whatever and dedicated the rest of the night filming with us because she has the whole weekend to rest and text with her crush.

anyways, despite that, i let it go. i thought to myself, she can do better in editing, since that's her forte and even I admire her for it. but alas, she's gotten difficult to contact again and this was the most frustrating part. it took So long for us to get her to edit the damn video clips (with the company messaging us every now and then, and me having the ashamedly reply that we're doing our best to fit it into our schedule), only for her to say she'll have it done last week of november. she said she'll have it done saturday, then sunday then went mia and then said she'll get it done first week of december for sure.

december came. my birthday was on the first week of december. she didn't greet me. didn't apologize til i talked to her days later to remind her of the video since she wasn't sending updates nor replying to the groupchat. i also told her i was hurt that she didn't greet me even a single ""hbd"" or even a belated greeting on my birthday and even posted stories of her with other people on her ig stories and saw me thanking people for greeting me on ig stories but never said a thing til i called her out. i was hurt cos she didn't acknowledge it. in all our years of friendship, i never missed greeting her and even apologized when i greet minutes late. meanwhile for her, she wouldn't even have said a thing if i didn't bring it up. she gave an ass excuse and apology which i accepted because i didn't want her to feel bad and be unable to finish editing the video. so i told her if she can just finish editing, that would be great.

she sent it december 5. and it was half-assed. literally just a compilation of our clips with background music. that's it. and i know that's not her best because i've seen her best work. and that was  not it. i was so disappointed. it wasn't worth the amount of money that was supposedly gonna be paid to us. it was embarrassing to submit it because it was late and it was clapped.

i downloaded the app inshot and tried to make some edits here and there but my old iphone 6s was not cooperating. despite deleting files already, the app kept freezing up and i couldn't even save the video because of the full storage. so i messaged her, carefully asking if she can kindly make a few edits on the app inshot. told her it was easier since it's on the phone and doesn't need the use of her slow laptop. she said she'll find time.

she didn't. days passed and i kept messaging her for updates and she either wouldn't reply or would give vague answers. 

december 8, she was asking for romcom movie suggestions that guys would also like. i'm assuming it's for previously mentioned crush. i played along and sent a few recs.

december 10 and 15. i asked for updates. vague or no replies.

december 16, i had to ask our other member/friend to edit on inshot because of the situation. she finished editing in a day, with consistent consulting from me. we managed to submit the same day. it came out looking better than the previous plain ass video.

the company never replied to this day even with emails from me every now and then asking even for just a message of them saying they don't want to push forward.

$1.1k + exposure from the big company + me and my other friend's efforts = Wasted.

and to add, the group i like might be having a concert in my country next year and i still don't have money. i was expecting i'd have money from the project as my base savings at least. now, i'm scared that a repeat of me not being able to secure tickets for an artist i like would happen again because of financial problems.


december 24 onwards she messages me every now and then and asks if i was mad at her. haven't replied til today, january 1, around 2AM. sent her the song Breathe by Taylor Swift. incredibly fitting and easy to conprehend. the end of the decade. the end of a friendship.

It's gotten to a point that the only thing I can think about is what I'm gonna do if I don't get it, and as midnight approaches every single firework rocket that explodes outside and interrupts my train of thought is making me agitated to the point where I cancelled my plans and will just stay in my bed so I don't have to spread negativity amongst others.

We also live in a smaller home and one of the things we daydream about the most is having a bigger home with a nice kitchen to host and entertain our loved ones. There are other house wishes such as garage spaces for both our vehicles, a nice bathtub, etc.

And on top of all of that, we both want very much to get married. I don’t feel the need to consider what others may want regarding what our wedding ceremony would look like (an elopement or very small gathering sounds lovely to me), but there is more expectation coming from my SO’s family. I’m ok with honoring it to a point, but both of us know those expectations = $ (we would be paying for everything) We are also not what folks would consider formally engaged, and there are some financials there regarding engagement jewelry. 

I think that my best case scenario would play out like this:  

-Small wedding, exchange wedding bands, reception (don’t blow a *ton* of money for a single day)

-Reasonable honeymoon

-Stay in our current house and make do until we have x amount squirreled away for a home down payment

-If afterwards it’s still a “thing” and we are financially ok, purchase of some sort of traditional engagement-style jewelry 
 
I feel like this sounds okay. I know my SO struggles with the engagement jewelry part because it’s another thing that’s expected, but if I’m the person that would be wearing it isn’t it ok for me to say we can hold off?

163,"and i love it.

I've been struggling with anxiety and depression and other mental health issues for ages which has made me a bit isolated. I've been getting better, slowly but surely, and have made some friends but they are all back home for the holiday period.

 Every year I've been really stressing out over what I'm gonna do. Seems like there is so much pressure to go out there and party like there's no tomorrow otherwise you're a loser.

Well this year I'm also back home at my parents house. They have fallen asleep early and I'm not gonna wake them up lol.

I did get some invitations from my cousins and some old friends to their house parties but I just can't be bothered to really go out and drink and wake up feeling shite tomorrow.

Nah, this year I'm sitting at home, listening to some fucking nice music, drinking champagne and watching the fireworks.

And I'm feeling good about it.

No anxiety, no pressure no nothing, just pure zen.

This year is gonna be good AF cause I finally learned how to not give a fuck.

Happy new year everyone!",31Dec2019,1
164,I love having time off school but it really does get lonely. I have only spoken to my parents and my internet friends since December 21st. I’m sure a lot of people are also alone on New Year’s Eve and I know how bad it is. I wish I could be out somewhere but no. I’m here in my house talking to random people on the internet.,31Dec2019,1
165,"So basically it’s known that Reddit is the ideal place for discussion and interaction with a community. I used to blog on tumblr and blogger way back then, just personal things, no promotion or anything like that — basically a diary. But I’ve found that those outlets have fewer users and more and more bots. 

My question is, is there a subreddit that pretty much acts like the old-school type text blog sites? For example... the title of the post would be the subject title and the body would be the actual blog content — and you could talk about anything, no restriction on theme or topics. Then redditors could just comment and vote like normal and create discussion.",31Dec2019,1
166,"When chemistry happens, there is fire and change and what once was is something new. The purpose of life is immaculate conception of the Eternal Now, which is only given by awareness and respect to it. Tapping into the impersonal Love frequency that is the Godhead within the Eternal Now allows the soul to be comfortably within continuum. Ego, the pain of experience from a singular perspective, shines a shadow onto this natural state of being. Forgiveness of the trauma caused by birth and growth as we mature into a healthy adult allows us to have impersonal Love for others who have been hurt by Life.

We need to take responsibility for the fact that mind and emotion have inertia. They have an effect on others, and they imprint themselves into our surroundings. When we treat ourselves, our space, our stuff with lack and neglect, it reflects back on us poorly.

As within; so without. One duality of existence is that our internal perception flavours our reality, such is the internal pain of our existence taken out on others around us if it is not given Love and awareness. Because of referral patterns existing within all 4 bodies (physical, emotional, mental, spiritual), the deceiver tricks us into many traps and patterns. Many of these are trauma, many are neglect, many are simply inexperience. 

One duality of existence is the side that is in the Light and the side that is in the dark. Our consciousness tethered into our being reflects soul no matter what, but it is up to ***us*** to see the devil on our back, not as Satan the shadow aspect but as Lucifer the Lightbringer, Angel most loved of God.

We bring this Light of Love into the fall and the pain of our existence. We forgive it for the trauma inherent into the human experience, and we try not to hurt others again.

This is spirit.",31Dec2019,1

I hate Hong Kong. I had travelled to a lot of places and I hate Hong Kong. I will tell you why. 

First of all though, so as to make it clear, I have to tell you relevant information about me. I’m black. I have two citizenships. Meaning two passports. One From Africa and the other is from Europe. I had travelled to Hong Kong with my African passport and this is what happened. 


So I arrived in Hong Kong and I’m lining up for immigration. 
Next thing you know, immigration officers came and took all the 8 black guys from the immigration queues and told us to follow them. I’m not lying to you, there’s about 200-300 people and they took the 8 black guys out.
It wasn’t my first rodeo with this kind of treatment and I’ve long established that I should be passive when these type of stuff happens as me talking back would only make it worse. 
They took us to a room and one by one asked us why we were in HK, how long we were staying, where we were staying, how much money we had, even asked to show them the money and finally, gesturing with his hand the officer says to me “Don’t work here, go back in time!”
It was really offensive. I know there’s immigration procedures in handling someone you suspect over something, but this was different. I knew why all this was happening and why it’s was just for the black guys. 
Anyways, I went to the immigration booths, got my passport stamped and I’m going to the luggage collection area. 
It was a 10 hour flight and I was tired and also had a stomach ache from the airplane food. While I was trying to figure out where my luggage was at, I really felt the stomach ache and it was at this point that I rubbed my stomach.
I didn’t think of it much as it was just an ache. But I was too naive. The immigration officers had been following the black guys with their CCTV and one of them had just rubbed his stomach. 

Moments later, an immigration officer came and rudely tried to pull me without any explanation. I pushed his hand away and I said “WTF are you doing?” He then told me to follow him and I asked where and he said they want to talk to me. I didn’t know what this was all about and I said that his colleagues had a talk with me earlier on. And he said that this is different and I asked how this was different. He said we’ll talk more in his office. 

I was really confused and I really didn’t know what was going on and I was a bit scared. But I asked him if I at least could gather my luggage’s before I go with him. He agreed and we found my luggage and we went to some office that was in the airport.

He told me to sit and he told me to wait. I waited for about 20-30 minutes. I am seriously starting to get worried now. 
About 30 minutes later, two guys came into the room and only one spoke English, but barely. He pointed to my bags and and he asked “How many Kilo?” 
I thought he wanted to know how many kilos my bags were and I had 43 kilos, which was the allowed amount and I told him that. He then translated what I said to the other guy, and the guy said “WHOA!” and a lot more words in Cantonese. I didn’t know what was going on but I also knew that I had triggered something when I said 43 kilos. And then they left.

I had come to HK for a meeting with some company executives and they had arranged for a driver to pick me up and I was told that he’d be waiting for me holding a sign with my name written on it. I was also told that he’d take me to the hotel the company had booked for me. A hotel, I didn’t know, if the driver decided to leave after I don’t show up. Thinking of this for me angry and I started banging on the door and I started shouting “You need to let me go” 
They had left me for another 45 minutes by that time.

A few moments later, things really got interesting. A lot of people came into the room. People that had stripes on their uniforms. And then there was a camera crew. A camera crew?  That resonates that TV show “Border Partrol”

As soon as I thought “Border Patrol”, I knew what this whole thing was about. I knew why they got excited when I said 43 kilos and I knew why I was in the room. 


Then it begun. Camera crew was setup. All the stripes people left and now there’s two officers. One guy started talking and he asked me where I was coming from, what I do for business and why I was in Hong Kong. I even showed him some of the correspondence I had with the company I was to supposed to see, from my iPad.

The one guy who was quiet the whole time interrupted me and loudly says “You lie! We don’t believe you, you are a drug smuggler”. And he even went further and said “we know you black guys, you want to be rich by selling drugs, we catch a lot of Nigerians before, we know!”
It was a lot to take in. I now know anything I say won’t help my cause. And I simply just said, you say I have drugs , you check my bags , I don’t have anything”. They said they will and that they haven’t checked it yet because they to bring a dog and the litmus paper thing. 
I was fine with all this, so long as it cleared me. 
About 10 minutes later, some 3 guys came , with a dog and they started checking my bag. The dog sniffed and nothing happened. So they started manually with their hands. They checked every single part of my bag, even went as far us unscrewing the handles. 

NOTHING!!!

Hour 4- Camera is rolling the whole time and the interrogation continues. 


One of the guys says, “you don’t have the drugs on your bags but you have them inside your body”. Which i denied adamantly.
So they decided to use a different tactic on me. The old Good cop/ bad cop routine. 

Started with bad cop. He started shouting at me with threats saying I will spend the rest of my life in jail if I don’t cooperate. I replied I have nothing to say to him cuz I don’t have anything. And then this guy decides to say something that really kissed me off. He saw my African passport and says, “ You know, in Hong Kong, in jail, we have free food” he is clearly implying that I need not worry about food and that this was not Africa. That was really racist and really fucked up. I got pissed and took out a 100$ from my pocket, folded it, and threw it to his face. I said “Motherfucker, I did not come here to eat food. I’m a businessman and I’m not a fucking drug mule”. I also added that I’ve had enough and that I need to make a phone call. By this point, the guy got up and left. 

Camera is still rolling.

About 10 minutes later, the other guy comes in and we had a Coca-Cola. Such a Cliche’. He starts talking with a different tone from earlier. Softer and friendlier. He says, “My friend, you see those guys, they’re not your friends. But I’m your friend. And I think we can help each other here, my friend.” 
Wasn’t sure what he was talking about and so I asked him as bluntly as I could. “Help you how, Boss?” 
That’s when he said the most ignorant thing ever. He said , “Maybe if you help us now, we can help you by giving you a job, instead of jail and you can tell us which Africans are coming here with drugs.” 

I was literally dumbfounded by what he said. And it was so ignorant beyond belief. I just got up and angrily said “Motherfucker, do you think I know every African? Do you think you are talking to a child?” 
I lost my shot and by this time, it’s been about 6 hours of this and they’re not even letting me get a phone call. 

I wanted to piss. So I banged on the door and shored out. 3 guys came and I told them that I wanted to piss. For which they said not now, maybe later. I wasn’t going to be holding my piss and I’m angry already. I said “You know what..” and I just took out my junk and bluffed like I was gonna pee all over the room.” They were shocked and said OK, OK,, give us 5 minutes and they left me in room again.

About 10 minutes later, one of the guys with the stripes and 5 more officers tell me that they will accompany me to the toilet. And they also added I had to drag my bag there. 
 The toilet is a good 5 minute walk and we had to pass a lot of people in the airport. 

Imagine this.. a black guy is surrounded by 5 officers, 2 random guys, 3 guys from the tv crew.. and they’re all taking to the bathroom. 
I understood they were scared that I’d flush the drugs or something but what pissed me off was when the cameraman tried to get into the toilet. I said, “Hell No! And the boss, told him to stay outside while me and two guys got into the toilet as they watched every drop of my pee.

Then we were back to the small room. I’m tired, hungry and just worn out by this point and it has been 8 hours since this all started. 


Then came the paper. The paper that was written in Cantonese. The paper they wanted me to sign without offering an English copy. And simply offering vague comments like it’s for my own good and that they were trying to help me. IDK how they’d expect me to believe them after all this. I said NO. I’m not signing any paper and in fact I want my phone call, RIGHT NOW! The guy said ok, ok and left me in the room , yet again.

They then came up with another paper that was in English and told me to sign. I read it and it was a form that stated that I agreed to a full on body check blah blah.. which I was happy to comply too since the beginning of all. I don’t have drugs. I have no reason to get scared.

I’m getting more and more madder. But they’re seeing this as a deflection of some sort and in fact they are getting more and more convinced that I have drugs.i found this out when we started heading to the hospital. On the way there, the guy that stopped me in the beginning of it all, said “Because if you, I’ll get a big promotion”. He said it very enthused by this all.  I just told him”Dream on, Asshole!” 

When we left the airport, outside is quiet dark and it’s about 1am. We reached the hospital, which was a good 20 minutes ride. I had counted 11 people that accompanied me to the hospital. Two cars. 

They told me to change my cloth and I was given a hospital gown for my scan. I got to the citiscan and you can see the control room from inside. And all the officers, camera crew and the doctors were in that room. 

I did my scan. The first thing I saw was the camera going down and turning off for the first time in a gazzillion hours. They have been taking turns to record the whole thing. And now it was off. 

And then I see all the people inside faces dropping. Everyone was so sure that I had drugs that when they found out I didn’t, they were shocked and disappointed with themselves. And then there was the sudden realization of being sued. That I can sue them.

People that have been assholes to me this whole time send one guy in to the scanning room and he tells me to change my cloth and that we will talk and they will even drop me to my hotel. 

I changed my cloth and I come out. THEY WERE GONE!!  They slipped out. No Apology, no ride , NOTHING!

I was so angry. I wanted to do something but I was too tired and I needed to sleep. I don’t know where my hotel is as it was booked for me. I haven’t changed money, I have no one to call at that time and I’m in a country I’ve never been too. I’m carrying two big bags as my trio won’t stop in HK. I get out from the hospital and I started walking, trying to find a taxi, a hotel, anything. 
It’s 4 am by now. I ended up finding an expensive hotel but I had no choice so I spent the night. 

I got in touch with the company execs the next day and they told me their driver waited for so many hours for me. I had to tell them what happened and they were so shocked.

They advised me that I should sue the airport and that they will help me. We went to the airport and I saw one of the guys with the stripes and told my friend he was one of the guys. Imagine after all that and this guy denies that he’s ever seen me before. 

That really got me angry yet again. My friend said we should talk to a lawyer and I couldn’t. I couldn’t because I only had one day in HK as I had to go to mainland China for an important contract signing I couldn’t miss. 

This was my experience in Hong Kong and I hate it. I hate Hong Kong.",31Dec2019,1
