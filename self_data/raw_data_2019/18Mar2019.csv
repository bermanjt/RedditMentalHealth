She had already spoken to the manager about me, so the manager and I chatted for a minute about my availability and whatnot.
Then, she said she would pass my resume onto the hiring manager and I can expect a call about an interview soon!

I always feel like I'm behind my peers and others my age even if I feel lucky that I have a stable job in my field. It isn't my dream job, but i also have this fear my dream job won't be all I hoped for. Then is my life as a whole even going to ever be something I can be happy with? I don't know but it stresses me out every day. I have a potentially big change happening in my life very soon that hinges on a couple things lining up in my life but it also stresses me out majorly.

4,"It's so silly that my whole outlook on life pretty much only depends on my mood. I rationalize cynicism when I'm upset and I rationalize optimism when I'm happy. It seems like I'm a robot commanded by feelings, and then fooling itself that it came up with ideas on its own. Kinda like inception. I know this isn't a new idea,  but I think all of our complex emotions are just coding to ensure our survival and make us reproduce. Maybe even awe and appreciation of beauty, in my opinion the purest of emotions, which takes a bit of the fun out of it. 

If there even is a me, I guess all it is is like an advanced cinema goer. Experiencing thoughts and feelings and senses. Unable to react to anything, only mindlessly experiencing. Is such a thing even alive? 
I really want a soul, an identity. If we were to discover one though, a million more questions would arise. I guess you can just wonder forever. Since I can't not let it get to me, it's probably best to drop it, stop thinking about it. 
The universe scares me, death scares me. I feel like all I'm doing in life is just seeking comfort. Everything is an escape from death and uncertainty",18Mar2019,3

As I said earlier, I realized when I started being this way and wanted to stop.

6,"In ""Architectural Agents: The Delusional, Abusive, Addictive Lives of Buildings"", the author, Annabel Jane Wharton, argues for the perpetuation of addiction that virtual spaces allow, especially through their visuals and architecture. In the first section (which is the only section I have been able to slog through so far), Wharton presents evidence of brutal violence and illusions of freedom for her case that video games are facilitating negative addictive habits without providing any valuable experiences. This evidence includes analogous connections between virtual spaces and Las Vegas casinos, equating first-person and third-person shooters to slot machines as ""the most addictive and the best source of corporate profit."" Wharton specifically analyzes *Assassin's Creed* and bases her arguments on Abstergo Industries' goal of world domination, Altaïr's extensive arsenal and skill set, the open world nature of the game, the game's historical foundation, and certain aspects and limitations of gameplay. With these observations, Wharton asserts the game deceives the player through a false sense of freedom and historical fictionalization while harboring intentions to instill a negatively charged addiction within a virtual playground.

While Wharton is likely correct that many people are addicted to video games, this focus on negativity is founded on misinformed and erroneous observations. Wharton quotes Assembly Bill 1179 by the California State Assembly, which was an effort ""to criminalize the sale of violent video games""; one quote she uses claims that the excessive violence of video games ""causes the game, as a whole, to lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors."" Yet two pages later she provides the historical events that *Assassin's Creed* is based upon, which is also explored in the game through dialog, architecture, and background events passively occurring throughout the game. Furthermore, Wharton discusses a the possibility that the US invasion of Iraq influenced the game based upon the opening notice that the game is ""[i]nspired by historical events and characters"" given to the player when beginning the single-player campaign. Noting the plot is heavily focused on the ""elimination of warmongers"", Wharton asserts the public outcry against this invasion and its aftermath could also be reflected in the game. If Wharton herself, an obvious advocate against gaming, could make this alternative connection to real-world politics, then how could such games not provide value to its players? This is not lighthearted commentary; if *Assassin's Creed* is indeed putting forth such a claim through subtle narration, then the game is giving a strong and biased perspective on US politics and culture that would be quite hotly debated. But even if the creators of the game were not advocating this claim, the fact that Wharton was able to make this connection, as well as her 34 page chapter's existence, display the ability of video games to create political and literary value. Nurturing an addiction to the cultural medium of video games that is able to stir discussions about society is not as destructive as Wharton's opening assertion is claiming.

Deception also plays a heavy role in Wharton's version of virtuality addiction. The gameplay mechanics of *Assassin's Creed* that she discusses include the freeclimbing abilities and weapon set Altaïr possess, the third-person camera following him, and the grandiose environment that the character can explore. With the massive amounts of resources at the player's disposal, it's made clear that interactive freedom is a driving factor of the game's popularity. Wharton solidifies this view by quoting *Assassin's Creed's* creative director, Patrice Désilets, who said that ""it was really important that the player could go anywhere and interact with anything"" from the outset of production. Wharton claims this freedom given to the player incites addiction to gaming, but it's less like freedom and more like ""freedom""; equating the player to a tourist, the ""false sense of spatial access"" is identical to one that a tourist might feel, which is falsely authentic and highly restricted. The player is entirely within alien territory and relies on tourist-like instruments to navigate, like a compass, maps, guidebooks, and major attractions. Wharton also notes Altaïr's 'arbitrarly-restricted' mobility, meaning he can climb insanely tall towers but not rocks or trees, and ""his sophisticated skill-set does not include swimming,"" since he drowns in water. Additionally, the third-person view restricts the player in small spaces because of its bulky nature, and Altaïr himself is not allowed access to certain parts of the map until he has progressed in the storyline and has been promoted. These claims clearly show an uninformed knowledge of video game creation and a misinterpretation of gameplay. Creating and incorporating gameplay mechanics are not easy processes; creating an environment that is 100% accessible in every aspect while still retaining the sheer size found in *Assassin's Creed* and inventing a third-person perspective that feels natural despite the fact that every human being with sight experiences the world from a 'first-person' perspective is a incredibly difficult endeavour to achieve today, and was even more improbable in 2007 when the game was released. Wharton also describes Altaïr's restriction from accessing different parts of the game before being promoted like every person alive in 1191 Damascus, Syria, Acre, Israel, and Jerusalem, Israel was allowed full access to everywhere in the city at any given time, which is obviously a ridiculous assumption.

10,"My dog was tied up on leash and another dog came over, off leash, and surprised my dog and they went for each other.  I ran over and pulled them apart fairly easily and thought that was the end of it.  But the other dog wasn't controlled by his owner and came back for seconds and this time it was on and they grabbed each other by the mouth.  

This isn't the most dangerous kind of fight.  No-one's got anyone's neck but they're biting and snarling but I'm worried because my dog is a pit so I worried that the other dog might be in danger.  I shouted at him to let go but that had no effect, and then I remembered the viral advice about a woman who got a dog off her dog by sticking her finger up the dog's ass.  Fine.  So I pulled up my dog's tail and jammed my finger right up there to the top.  It had absolutely no effect.   Maybe it worked for the woman that initially shared her story because it wasn't a real fight.  The other dog was just dominating and was therefore open to having its attention diverted.  But I think it's less effective if the dog feels in danger.

I ended up punching both dogs in the head and that also didn't do a damn thing.  I then tried to pry my dog's jaws open with my hands.  I got my hands in his mouth and heaved.

Pro tip: don't do that

That went badly for me and we were now a minute in, and the dogs were still snarling and chomping down and shaking their heads to hurt each other.  

What DID work was that I grabbed my dog's collar and then put my foot against the other dog's face and pushed and pulled and they had no choice but to separate.  I had the greater leverage now and all they could decide was how much the process was going to hurt them.

I'm not saying this method is safest.  People say you shouldn't get  involved in dog fights and, if your safety is paramount, then that has to be the correct approach.  But if you're committed to separating them (sticking my stupid fingers in their biting mouths was certainly evidence of that) then grabbing the collar and pushing on the side of the other dog's mouth while pulling is guaranteed to separate them.  Just be careful what you wish for.",18Mar2019,2

12,"Hi Im Rainbow. 

I got on reddit because I got tired of Tumblr and Facebook, basically. I’ve never used Twitter but I got an account recently because that’s apparently a thing that youtubers do so I have to get with it if I want to communicate with my thousands of fans (/s). I used to like IG a lot but got scared into not wanting to share my face on the internet anymore. It sucks because taking selfies used to really make me feel beautiful. But creeps terrify me. 

I got on reddit for subreddits like r/ZooTycoon , r/anxiety, r/aww. I got my first and only viral post from r/aww with my grandma’s cat and it was such a nice few days my grandparents were so invested once I explained to them how reddit works. They kept asking me for updates and they still havent gotten over how someone from Switzerland commented. They really got a trip out of seeing how far Sandy would go. 

Im amazed by the r/ZooTycoon community because I never anticipated other people liking these games as much as I do. It’s been incredibly inspiring to start posting playthroughs myself to share with people this wholesome af game that I love. 

Ive had a rough fucking year tbh. Second roughest year of my life. I struggle with anxiety and depression and mood swings (I generally can’t control my emotions) and it’s kind of a miracle I’m still here today. I’ve been really trying to be grateful for the good in my life and applying myself to things I want to learn despite not immediately being good at it. I’ve been trying to roll with the punches despite getting into two car accidents and very sick several times this year, bad changes in medication that resulted in me attempting suicide twice, and being in a generally toxic environment at home. 

On a lighter note here are my guilty pleasures (that arent really guilty cuz fuck being ashamed of what I like lol I just like boring shit come at me).I cant handle the drama in popular tv shows at all I like shows that are predictable. Right now Im obsessed with Judge Judy but before I’ve also been obsessed with Burn Notice, The Office, Kitchen Nightmares, and the original Star Trek. This kind of extends to video games. Oh and despite being a “gamer” in almost every sense of the word I am terrible at most video games. Like I absolutely love Five Nights at Freddy’s, once I was binge watching those playthroughs like one of my tv shows. I have merch and everything. Never played it a day in my life. I have a hard time learning controls and I cant handle any scares if Im the one playing. I love watching horror games though.

This love started with Fatal Frame 2 or Project Zero: The Crimson Butterfly. My sister and I could not have stretched this game out any more than we did. We were so scared we went super slow through the game and got further into it over literal years. My sister (2 years younger) was always braver and she would play and I would watch. The menu music has become so nostalgia-inducing from every time we paused because something scared us too much, or my sister left the game for a while. 

I could rant for a long time about why I love it so much but I don’t think I should talk about myself much longer. Here is some sisterly advice for y’all out there, especially to my fellow young adults. 

No one ever found happiness from doing what everyone else told them to do. Stop trying to please everyone and remember that this is your life. What kind of person are you going to be? What kind of energy are you going to put out into the world? You could do what everyone else tells you to do and it still turns out to be wrong. Listen to your gut, and be responsible. Own what you are good at and own up to your mistakes. 

Tip to juggle life, keep calm and add it to the to-do list. Be realistic about the amount of time and energy you can devote to something. Be realistic about budgets. Don’t get a pet unless you’re truly ready. And if you’re waiting for a sign to make a positive change in your life, this is it - do it. 

I hope you have a great one

17,"I have been dealing with depression, anxiety and self harming issues  for about 8 years (I’m 21F).

I sometimes go a couple months without any depressive episodes  and where I’m in a generally awesome mood and feeling very motivated and I think I’ve finally conquered my mental illnesses.

21,"This is a pretty big discovery. It'll help with a lot of issues:

1. I have a ventilation issue in the bathroom. This will make it easier to dry out the bathroom especially after a shower. The damp bathroom, poor ventilation, and the fact it faces south so gets hit with a lot of sunlight basically turns it into a greenhouse and a breeding ground for mold. Adequate ventilation from the fan will evacuate the moisture so it stays dry.
2. Furthermore, since the fan is blowing air out (not in), it should be blowing out any existing mold spores before they have a chance to recplonize.
3. It actually improves ventilation through the rest of the apartment. The two other windows this fan pulls air in from are equidistant from the bathroom window, so this will lead to roughly equal airflow through the entire apartment. No hot spots.

23,"26 years old and living at home still. There's so much to say but I feel like that's a good start. I'm the oldest of three kids.  The youngest is living with friends and the middle is special needs. 

  We were all living in a house while I started my adult life. I had just gotten my diploma and began an associate's degree program while also delivering pizzas for pizza hut. I got through half my credits when my grandmother asked to live with us because she was lonely. So we move to a new house and unfortunately I no longer got a room to myself and had to share with my little bro who is 7 years younger than I am. 

 I wasnt popular. I was sad because I missed my grandpa. I was angry because I couldn't make friends as easily. I ended up losing my scholarship and grant money, then took a year off. A reallllllly long year off that's still going on. 

 This was supposed to be good time enough for me to build a ""plan b"" for my life and I got a new job at Hastings. I worked for a year and got promoted and was quickly earning a department manager position with full time hours when my mom approached me. One day out of nowhere she told me that we were moving because they couldn't afford their part of the rent and that we had two weeks to pack.

   We end up moving to a one bed motel and my grandma moves into her own apartment.  This was when I really started to develop my mental illnesses due to the stress from living in a single room with my little siblings and my parents. I have major depressive disorder and general anxiety but at that time I was undiagnosed and unmedicated so it was even more difficult to have hope for my own future.. I ended up getting fired from my key holder position because of a policy violation.  

  For the next two years we hopped around motel to motel. Four vehicles I bought were stolen from me.  I went through 5 different and awful jobs.  My dad started electro shock therapy for gulf war syndrome which disabled him mentally.  He hasn't worked since before I even was in the 11th grade, by his own choice, but now he was actually disabled. So my mom kinda expected me to focus on helping my special needs sister, so that she could get my dad on disability.  I won't get into that much but trust me when I say that mental disabilities are not funny and are constant turmoil and work for everyone involved. 

   My dad got disability and we were able to move to an apartment instead of another motel room. I was 22, didn't have a car, and didn't have a job. For two years I slept in the living room of that apartment and couldn't leave because I was so afraid of getting robbed or hurt in some way.  I only went to the doctor after realizing that all the people I used to be friends with in high school were happy and living together. I realized that I needed help. I got my diagnosis after about a year of doctors not really giving a shit because I was young and ""healthy"". 

After that I really tried hard to make new friends but everyone I met felt like I was just a manchild. I've been called some awful things in the most genuine of ways so now I have zero confidence to try. Still alone and hurting was the only constant routine in my life. I worked this last year as a site manager for a custodial company at night.

   A year goes by and now my mom can get paid to care for my sister. She basically gets 40 hrs a week to feed my little sister and make sure she takes her medicine. This is good and we move to a better part of town where the auto theft continues but the gang activity does not. I get more confidence but people might age have no respect for me because I live at home and have nothing. From the outside looking in, it seems like I'm just some dude who is too lazy to grow up and I understand why it seems that way. 

Not even a year goes by and my mom gets breast cancer. I'm 26, 27 in April. She's still going through surgeries and I'm still at home helping.

  I don't know what to do anymore.  I'm so alone. People hate me so much that even my therapist ghosted me. I'm lucky enough to be starting a full time job on the 25th this month but I'm afraid that I'll fail again. I have a car I can borrow till I can afford my own. Even the fucking Starbucks guy calls me a baby under his breath Haha haha..  How am I supposed to have any sort of dignified experience? How am I supposed to forgive people for condescending to me when they dont know me?

30,"I feel like a terrible person. I had a bf and we only dated for two months and it was online/long distance but he was my first. He was suicidal and depressed and he told me that all his life everyone he’s ever been friends with has abandoned him. Usually it was because he gets feelings for them and once he tells them they ghost him and abandon him. When we met he was in the midst of one of these situations with his best friend and they were together for less than a week before she broke it off and ghosted him. He was devastated and suicidal and I helped him through it but it became too much. 

I didn’t know what to do and I also had started getting feelings for him because I had never had to care about someone so intensely before so I ended up deleting him on everything and he begged me to stay. So I stayed. Shortly after he and I got into a relationship. It was good for at most 2 weeks. Then he started showing his true colors, he started yelling at me for the smallest things, would only talk to me in the mornings to ask for nudes and then not talk to me the rest of the day, just overall being shitty. The worst was this one time where he was being really raunchy and sent me the porn that he was watching and then proceeded to compliment the girl and say that I was alright but if I looked like her he would be over the moon. I wasn’t enough. After roughly about a month he then broke up with me because he wasn’t over the best friend. I took it well and said that I wished him the best and that I still cared for him and loved him and that I would always be here. He realized what he was giving up and begged me to take him back. 

So I did on the condition that things change. They did for about a week or so and then the same  shitty behavior started again. But this time I broke it off.  We said that we would remain friends but he acted really immature and wasn’t taking the breakup well so I told him I needed time away from him. I deleted him on everything again on the condition that I’d add him back again in 2 weeks and see where our heads were at. We talked on the phone and he said he wanted to be friends but that he had too many feelings for me and needed to make new friends first. I agreed and we left it at that. Since then I initiated contact a few times just to see how he was doing and he responded very briefly. 

It’s been 8 months since we broke up but I only got over it very recently. I still had him on social media and whatnot but lately it was getting to me. I kept reliving the whole relationship. The pain, the hurt, etc. I’ve been depressed since then and having him on my contacts and seeing his name daily wasn’t helping any. So I deleted him for good and without warning. I started bawling when I did it because I have effectively abandoned him once and for all. I did the thing that everyone did before me. He can now say that I’m a monster and a terrible person for hurting him in the worst way possible to him. I’m not sure if he’s realized yet. And I’m scared for when he does and how he’ll react. If he were to reach out and ask to speak to me about why I deleted him I don’t know what I’d do. Because the truth is I’m not okay and I start therapy on Friday and I need him to not be in my life anymore because I’m about to break down in order to build myself back up again. How can I move on and heal when the very thing that broke me in the first place is still in my life? I can’t. I feel so much relief but at the same time I’m in so much pain again because I know this will hurt him. 
Am I a bad person for ghosting and abandoning someone I once loved? I don’t know. Maybe I am. Or maybe this whole thing is dramatic and stupid. Either way I feel shitty and I don’t know how to not feel shitty. ",18Mar2019,3

32,"I noticed that this is a comment that people don't typically say. It's weird to say ""I could see you with a white guy"", or ""You'd look good with an asian"". It's really not something that comes up in conversation, but I've noticed that I've been getting a lot of people saying that they could see me with a black guy. I don't understand what that's even supposed to mean, because people end up with just... anyone. I can't even imagine, you know? How do you picture someone who you've never seen or met before with someone else? I don't know how to explain it, but it kind of annoys me.

33,"Interestingly, I always revert back to the same thoughts and feelings everyday. If I were to die tomorrow, how many months would it take for someone to find me? how many people would attend my funeral? How quickly would people forget my existence?

&amp;#x200B;

Nowadays, my own body feels like it's transparent and see-through, but whenever I look in the mirror, I'm still there. No one knows when I wake up or go to sleep, or for how long, but when I do wake up, I find myself coldly staring down my own complexion in the bathroom mirror. Sometimes when I am there, I reflect on my past and compare it to my present situation, and make a realization every time I stare into my eyes. The realization that in past and present, my opinions don't matter. 

In a group of people, someone's idea is always better than mine, and no one even wants to look at my suggestions. If I call someone else out who uses my idea as their own, everyone else believes the other person and gang up on me because no one bothered to listen when i opened my mouth. 

&amp;#x200B;

I always had to call people to do things with them, and when we did they just hung out with me to have me stop calling them. I mean, I'm sorry that none of my friends are ever that interested in me to call me ever, or interested in me enough to start a conversation with me even. I used to try to talk to as many people and about as many things as possible, so people would find some worth in my presence, but nothing ever happens. I truly feel like a ghost, floating around all over the place, because i'm always ignored. The only friends I have are pity friends, and we can all agree that that's worse than having no friends, makes you feel like you aren't capable of doing even basic human functions, makes you feel like you are useless.

&amp;#x200B;

When I look in the mirror I can't stand the ugliness in my face. I can be completely nice to someone, or even have nothing against them, but they always seem to verbally abuse me behind my back about how i'm a terrible person and insult my facial looks and my body that  would be completely normal 2+ decades ago. I can't stand my reflection, I wish I couldn't wake up to see it everyday.

&amp;#x200B;

It's also harder to hold traditional values nowadays without being called nasty names and having everyone think you hate and oppress other people, even though I know it's not true. It's hard to be traditional and christian nowadays, as no one will ever think positively  of that if I reveal it to others. I have to hide who I am. And society seems to be drifting even further away from my little island I have now. I'm fading away in this world. I'm being stranded on my little  island with no other food or people.

&amp;#x200B;

I might as well accept it, my community, my society, my world is leaving me behind, like I never even needed to exist in the first place.",18Mar2019,2

35,"Long time lurker. First post 

I wasn’t sure where to post this but I wanted to share 


This happened earlier today around 6:30pm a couple city’s over from Vancouver, BC

I pull up to a gas station to grab a cool refreshment as I’m about to just go for a nice cruise in my car.  I park at one of the pumps and proceed to enter the gas station. As I’m approaching, I see a middle aged women and her son (I assume) parked next to the door and dump a empty cigarette box and wrappers out of her window like it was no big deal. Now, before I continue, I can’t stand people that litter ESPECIALLY when there is a garbage can 10 feet away from you. So, I called her out. I said “really?? You’re just going to throw your trash on the ground and drive away? Don’t worry, I’ll pick it up for you”. I pick up her trash off the ground and threw it in the nearest garbage can. As she was about to drive away, I used my freedom of speech and gave her the ol’ bird to remind her what a POS she was. 

I just get inside the gas station and the POS lady comes storming in to confront me. The confrontation goes something like this: 

Lady: “what’s your problem?! Are you late on rent or something?!?!”

Me: “I don’t pay rent. I have a mortgage. What’s that have to do with anything?”

Lady: “oh look at you with a mortgage. What’s your problem anyways?! I should phone the cops on you”

Me: “my only problem is you littering like it’s no big deal so I called you out and phone the police. I did nothing wrong”

Lady: “what’s your name?! I’m a nurse. I know people” 

Me: “my name is none of your business. You’re acting crazy lady. Just don’t litter and none of this would have happened!”

At this point I’m at the cashier and the lady is really close to me and straight up pushes me into the front of the cashier desk. 

Me: “don’t you dare touch me again! You have no right” 

Lady: “you don’t touch me!” 

(I never placed a finger on her or even thought about doing so)

Me: “I never touched you!” 

At this point, I was pretty mad after she assaulted me. Also I was done buying my refreshment and wanted to get out of there. So I wanted to kill her with kindness so I said “have a nice day!” With a big smile on my face as I go to my car. Within the next 30 seconds she’s yelling at me calling me scum of the earth, tells me I hope I die, etc etc until I close my door to drown out her crazy annoying voice. 

I stay in my vehicle until my adrenaline wears off (I’m shaking because I’m pretty angry at what just occurred so I didn’t want to drive). She yells at me for another 10 seconds or so and I just wave and smile until she drives off.

Moral of the story: Just don’t litter. People that do should be called out on their behaviour. Maybe I shouldn’t have gave her the finger when I threw out her trash but still, she deserved it. I thought about throwing the trash back in her vehicle but decided against it. Glad I didn’t because I was dealing with straight up crazy. ",18Mar2019,2
36,"We’ve been dating for just over a year and even though we’re in college I could see the rest of my life with her. The thing is that we’ve both been pretty depressed around each other recently. I think a lot of it has to do with this year of school has been particularly taxing on both of us mentally and the fact that we spend almost every day together. Also I’ve had a lot of self esteem issues recently and her depression has gotten pretty bad as well as her sex drive. I don’t mind either though, I just want her to be happy. Through all of it though, we always try to let each other know how we feel and that we still love each other.

The other day I wasn’t in a great mood after my sort of exhausting day. Earlier in the day she vented to me about something and I comforted her. Then later that day after a club meeting, I asked if we could hang out. She said she had a really bad headache. For some reason, this got me upset even though I’ve almost never gotten upset with her before. While walking to her car she noticed I was upset and asked me why and I said something like “it’s hard to always be the optimist with you sometimes”. This was a stupid thing to say. I know she just hasn’t been able to help me as much because of her depression. She started to feel pretty bad about herself after that.

The next day she texted to meet means she started crying and said that she might need to break up with me because she felt that what I said he might before was true and that I shouldn’t have to put up her depression and lack of sex drive anymore. I reminded her that I didn’t care and that I love her regardless. I told her it would probably be better if we took a break from seeing each other to work on our depression and get ourselves more excited to be with each other again. She thought that was a better idea and we hung out normally for an hour before saying bye for a week.

It’s only a few days later and we’ve gone from mild texting to lots of “I miss you”s. I’m just scared about what will happen after the week is up or when we see each other again. I’m scared about the future and I just want to be with her and for her to be happy. I know everything will be okay but I just needed to get this off my chest.

37,"The power I feel when I deprive my body of something it needs is like a drug. I force myself to stay away, to pull all-nighter after all-nighter. I finally feel in control, even when I know I’m spiraling. Even when I know that I’m completely and irrevocably out of control. I’m one critical thought away from a mental breakdown and yet I feel the most sane now then I ever have. 

And still, it’s not just sleep that I deprive myself of. It’s food too, tracking calories and tracking weight loss and tracking the number of times I get dizzy in a day. It’s like suicide, but I’m the only one who can see it and I’m the only one who denies it and denies it and denies it

They're more beautiful, more successful by default, more intelligent, easier to look at and easier to coexist with. 

I am the ""angry black woman' when I mention something that makes me uncomfortable, like a white woman throwing out the n-word at my job. I'll never be as beautiful or as wanted. And, oh look -- the curls that grow out of my head? Well they look better on a white person, sorry.

I hate being black, and I hate white people because they're so much better and so much more wanted than me and any white person I've ever spoken to about this *never* understands. They *never* see it, and in a lot of cases they even deny it.

Just because you haven't experienced your own mother calling you a racial slur, telling you you're less than your white cousins because you have black in you... That doesn't mean you can't empathize. You can try, you can try to understand what it's like for me to constantly wish I had just been born with white skin. So I wouldn't have to worry about my *life* if I got pulled over by the cops, so I could still feel beautiful standing next to a white woman.

46,"

This is a strange creative form of ""venting"" that I don't count as creative writing, fiction, or truth. It just is what it is.

I lose hours and weeks to dissociation. My conscious mind doesn't and apparently cannot understand why. I suspect it is tied into the frontal lobe and amygdala. 

I have 1 addiction left that is chemical. I know that is environmental because when I'm zoned out outside, I barely crave a smoke. I treated the wrong addiction first, and now I'm stuck back in an unmedicated state. 

What if your entire life was built around a carefully balanced level of chemicals and trance ? 

What if thought loops played in your mind for days? 

What if delusions sprung out of physical pain even in a relaxed state and completely became your reality?

 Imagine that. Imagine slipping into a real, deep physical trance where you gave yourself the suggestion to feel nothing. Now imagine doing that thousands of times for years. Imagine having a body that is completely obedient from years of conditioning and that body rebelled against its mind. My body is almost completely numb now, unless you tell it to be other ways. I look down and see I'm bleeding after hours of nothing but frustration but somehow you can make me *** from miles away.

What would you do if you knew my body would obey you perfectly, without question, instantly? I'm afraid to find out, but I myself, my mind... definitely want to find out what would happen if I harnessed that for myself.

Would you be upset that I'm harnessing limerence induced from months of conditioning? It was bound to happen. If you know it's a delusion it's not a threat. Would you be upset if you knew I haven't been gentle? I have forced my mind into places dark and light. I have experienced full psychosis, but doing so was to build up neural pathways. Doing so was to reparent myself and destroy all resistance against the things I truly want. Doing so was to find my self worth and to save my own life. Doing so was to restore old neural pathways that I liked....

You see, halfway through my project I decided I didn't want to erase packmama. I just needed to edit a few things. I know for a fact you can't understand me and don't see the bigger picture. This is almost a taunt now.

I am literally torturing myself into a being a better person and its paying off . Its actually pleasant now and I was happy to show you I was capable of happiness when listening to you. You don't notice the highlights in the videos being on effort. The visuals are always something to focus on so you don't have to look at me. In fact, it's hard to look at me. You don't notice the fact I practiced a mindset for hours if not days. You don't know that the practice... is probably helping me the most. You don't notice it's a response to something you said. You are starting to.

 I'm enslaving myself through a weakness to mindless obedience to authority with addictions of auditory, sexual, and intellectual orgasms. Not to mention expoliting a craving for repetition because of OCD/anxiety. I truly have no choice when it comes to zoning out. Sometimes it hurts and makes me angry. I get indignant when spoken down to. I needed that spark of rebellion. I resist you half the time and enjoy it the other. Everytime I get better at resistance my mind finds a new level, but I also get better in real life.

You doesn't notice the change of scenery. You don't notice that I am listening to you while speaking to you. You don't notice the words in the songs. You don't notice my vocal range being a direct message about the headspace I'm in. Let me be clear. I like this new headspace better. You don't notice that my ""arms and neck are blank."" You did notice my eyes rolling into the back of my head. That was an accident. 

You don't notice that I am showing self control, because I have created something that I know can control me. My only choice, to continue having choice is to take this farther. I will figure out why you have power over me and I will harness that for myself. I'm building an artificial executive function system. You don't notice because you never meant to help me in any way. You just think I'm weird and lonely. 

Conditioning rather than thought. I went outside in the sun. I bathed my dog. I asked for something. I've actually been studying for myself. I'm not foolish enough to try to find a way out right now, but I am building a way through. For that, fellow madman, I thank you. I guess I don't need your permission to use your work this way, but no one else is crazy enough to try this. If you are anything like me at all, you are curious.

And all this time it's cause she's actually pathetic and insecure. I was made to feel that way when in fact it was me all along that she felt threatened by.

52,"I have noticed some recent posts on r/self mentioning suicide and I wanted to touch that subject with ya'll.  If you're one who is thinking or contemplating suicide, I first ask that you seek help.  Call and talk with a family member or a friend, or go to the hospital and seek assistance from the medical professionals.   If you're a person set on not seeking help, then I ask that you sleep on it.  Get a good nights rest then wake up the next day and really think about it.   This is a decision that is permanent and one that cannot be taken back.  I want to throw out two stories I have experienced involving suicide to bring to your awareness.  I am not going to use any stories at this time from the police department, but instead go back to when I used to work hospital security.

In late 2016 we had a couple of college students arrive to our morgue within days apart from each other.  The first one was a nineteen year old female who had been going through relationship problems with her boyfriend and decided that life wasn't worth living once he broke up with her.  This one was sad because she still had a whole life to live and didn't see a point in living without this guy.  (I don't know if she realized but there is still a world with other men out there)  Her family was distraught when they arrived and spoke with the medical examiner.  They had no idea what was happening to their own daughter/sister and wished the world she had said something.  The pain the family felt was visible; and all they wanted was the chance to say goodbye one last time.  The unfortunate roommate, who found this young lady hanging in her dorm room, has her life changed forever too.  The friend that discovered her showed up to the hospital to give a statement to officers, and she too was distraught over her friend committing suicide.

A day or so later an ambulance arrived again from the same college and wheeled in another body bag into the morgue to us.  The medical examiner conducted his investigation and determined the young man had died from a self inflicted gunshot wound.  Later we learned from officers that this happened over the fact that he had failed his semester final exam.  The family arrived later on and the parents collapsed at the news.  Their child was dead and there was no way of bringing him back.  They hadn't seen him in many months, and rarely heard from him since he started classes.

I want to bring the fact that suicide doesn't just effect you, it effects EVERYBODY.   It effects you're family (parents, siblings, cousins, aunts/uncles) and friends.  Now for those of you who will argue that you have no family/friends, you're suicide then effects the first responders.  It effects the police officers, paramedics, fire rescue if they respond, hospital staff, and of course the medical examiner.   

There is more to life than whatever it is you are going through.  There is help, and all you need to do is let us know.  Let family or friends know, go to the hospital and talk to medical staff so they can direct you to get help, or if need be, just call 911, or call the National Suicide Hotline.  To have someone take their own life to me is a tragedy.  There are MANY reasons to live, we just need to help you find the right one.  Life is too valuable to just let it go.  I think I can safely say we all work our asses off to keep people alive, from First Aid assistance to CPR, and the last thing we want anyone to do is just throw in the towel.  I understand that life can be difficult and there will be curve balls thrown at everyone, but there is a way to overcome everything.  All you need to do is seek help and we will overcome it together.",18Mar2019,12
53,"So I am writing a book called ''it's only water'' and it is intended to be a realistic drama. The main character, Sarah, was born with a life threatening allergy to the H2O molecule. She is often bullied due to her allergy.

Drinking just a sip of water can prove fatal to her, as a bully in her class replaced the orange juice she drinks, with water. She took a mouthful of water and went into anaphylactic shock and the nurse has to inject her with an epi pen.

She also goes through other medical turmoils. For example she has an appendix surgery because she gets appendicitis. The doctors have to re-innovate surgery so that no water comes into contact with her internal organs. Unfortunately after said surgery, a nurse gives Sarah an intravenous saline drip, and goes into anaphylactic shock again since H2O molecules would now be present in her bloodstream.

An immunologist from one of the top hospitals in Britain diagnoses her and says that she has antibodies against the H2O molecule and she has to avoid drinking water or getting it into her body in any way.

She has to wear a specialized spacesuit like apparatus to prevent her from breathing in water vapor in the air. Cruel thieves break into her home at one point and steal the suit and rip it into lots of little pieces and leave it on the porch. These thieves were the same kids now grown up who bullied her in school.

I don't really know why I'm posting this. I don't need sympathy, because all of my family, friends and peers are pouring sympathy down my throat. I don't know if it's a cry for help and advice, because my family and I are already getting tons. Maybe it's just I need to get it off my chest, since IRL I'm very closed in. Putting my thoughts, feelings and emotions into text might be a form of therapy, since I can't afford an actual therapist. I honestly don't even know where to start, since it feels like every thought I have is equally important to the subject at hand. 

I guess I'll start from the last few days and see where that takes me.

Saturday, March 16th. St Patty's Day. I wake up to go to work, wondering if it will be a busy day. ""Will the drunk people celebrating want subway?"" I thought to myself. I take my shower, get dressed and look outside, seeing it's sunny! I felt like I hadn't seen the sun in months, and I felt upbeat and happy. Nothing was gonna set me back. I walked out to the living room, and saw my father. ""Off to work, see you later!"" I said, one foot out the door. ""Oh, I'll give you a ride. I'm going uptown anyways"" he said before I could close the door. I agree and he gives me a ride. He tells me that his fingers have been numb, but he doesn't think it's serious. I think nothing of it, my entire life he has had weird problems, and somehow grew out of them.

During the drive I notice something. His driving wasn't...normal. He was further left then normal, not so much he was in the middle lane, but he wasn't middle of his lane like normal. ""I think you should move the car a little to the right Dad, you damn near of the yellow lines."" I said ""It's fine until you cross the lines."" He retorts. I said nothing. After about 2 minutes of silence, he just swerves into the opposite lane. Almost fucking killing us. The people honk, and he yells out his window ""I wasn't even near ya!"" But he was near him. In fact, if the guy was just a second slower, we would've crashed badly. He pulls into my workplace parking lot, and I ask if he wants me to call someone to come get him, he declines and drives off. 

Fast foward an hour into my shift, my Mom calls me, asking what is wrong with my father. I have no idea, and neither does she. She tells me that a family friend, we'll call him ""John"", is coming to take him to the hospital. ""Keep me updated."" I tell her. I hear nothing all day, so after we close up the store, I give a call to John. He tells me it was a stroke. 

I walk home, and when I see my Dad I ask him how he is, how bad is it, etc. And when he is answering me, he seems...off. He swung from subject to subject, and the subjects were very loosely connected. Somehow his answer for how it feels to use his fingers, jumps to George Jetson. Talks about how he doesn't use cogs or gears. And don't ask how he made them connected, because I'm not sure. It only made sense to him. 

Next morning, Sunday, March 17th. Everything is silent. I walk out to the living room, and he is napping on the couch. I talk to my Mom and she tells me that he has a kinked artery, and at any second he could have a stroke. And the next stroke, will be a major stroke. First one was apparently minor, and happened when he was napping. He woke up, and his fingers were shot. But he didn't make a big deal of it, so who was to worry? I went uptown, got dinner for us all. Got him some things, saw a friend, it was oddly peaceful in a way. 

Later that day, about 5pm. We hear him SCREAMING outside, alongside loud cracks and bangs. My mother is hysterical, and is calling John for help. I go outside, and see him banging a piece of wood onto another piece. ""SHUT UP YOUR FUCKING DOG"" He screams at the top of his lungs. He then proceeds to beat the wood and bark back. ""What are you doing?!"" I ask. ""I'm shutting up the dog, he's being-SHUT UP YOUR FUCKING DOG- loud."" He then says fuck it, and goes into the the car, and honks the horn. My mother comes out, and pushes his hand off the wheel. ""Well fine, if I can't honk it, I'll beat it into scrap. I basically carry him inside, and John shows up. My father acts like everything is normal. And thats how our night basically ends.

Is this my life now? I'm writing this at 4Am, and I'm contemplating even staying in this fucking house. My father has fucking lost it. A friend of his, that he hasn't seen in a good 6 months, came by, and talked him into going to the hospital tomorrow morning. Thank God. I'm scared I'm losing my Dad. He has had angry outbursts for the last two years, but NOTHING like this. Just a scream fit here and there. Not barking at a fucking dog. Thats what Kramer from Seinfeld would've done. Not a sound, stable persons reaction. 

I guess I'll have to live with this. I've had a rough life already, so this is just another pit stop I guess. But fuck man, I never wanted to lose my father. Not like this, anyways. 

TL;DR: Father had stroke, has done a complete 180, barked at dog. He is not himself.",18Mar2019,2

I’ve already told her this before, but I just feel so alone. 

We had a class in high school together and reconnected recently and we bonded so well that we started dating. We are currently across the country from each other, but I’m going to be moving there in 3.5 weeks.

I just miss her so much. The wait is killing me. I miss the hugs and kisses and being able to hold her and going places with her and just having the ability to look to my right and see her and her beautiful smile. It hurts. When I came back to where I live, I cried for days. I finally had someone that didn’t want to hurt me or see me jump through hoops. This was the first non abusive relationship I’ve had and it feels so amazing. I don’t have to hide what I’m saying. I can communicate with her and tell her what is on my mind. I can tell her anything. We get along so well and it’s honestly the thing I look forward to the most when I wake up. 

I know I’m just complaining and so many other couples spend years apart and some never make it to this point, but I am so happy that I get to be with this girl. She’s so perfect and awesome. 

In the small chance she’s reading this, I love you honey. You’re so good and I want all your hugs and kisses. ",18Mar2019,1

62,"Massive rant, it won't be coherent.

So I'm a 17 year old male living in Australia.

I've always been hot and cold with my emotions, I just don't feel like I'm in control of them. Ever since I was a little kid, I would flip like a switch, from fine to overwhelmed with emotions. When I was younger it was pretty tame, but now it gets scary. I feel so full of rage. It feels like I'm not in my head at the stage when I flip out - it disgraces me. I can put the process down to a science: I am confronted &gt; I get defensive &gt; They counter &gt; Rage &gt; Massive rage &gt; Breakdown &gt; Self harm. It's always with my parents, I'm too anxious to make a scene ever in public - to the point where I define making a scene to be having a normal conversation. I'm working on that last bit, but it's in the back of my mind. I've always wanted to escape, to leave this city and move over East, but I wouldn't make it. I just couldn't. Those desires come so randomly, they feel irrational. I can't ever put my mind to something and stick with it. I've always loved the magic of knowing something new, but when I look into something, it drives the magic away and I lose interest. All of the uni courses I considered, gone - boring. It frustrates me.

I don't have any friends. Well I'll only ever have one at a time. I'll pick a person quite unintentionally and just pour everything I have into them. It drives them away, as it should. I understand their choice. I've never been able to get close enough to someone to talk to them about these issues, and this post is the result of the past 5 years or so of inner turmoil.  Everyone likes me, but no one *likes* me. I'm that kid at school that everyone knows, and that everyone likes, but has no friends. History lesson. In primary school, I had one friend, who - when we got to high school - left me to be 'cool'. I knew someone who played on my hockey team, and I latched onto him at orientation. We were the closest of friends for 3 years. Then it died. The realisation that he has emotionally abusing me came around, and that I was nothing more than an object, manipulated solely for the satisfaction for his desire for friendship, and I fell for every word. He got a girlfriend, he rubbed me into the ground, he left - new school - and I had no friends. Nothing much has changed from there. I find that my anxiety inhibits my ability to make new friends in unfamiliar environments, but that is getting better.

Now the decision is coming for my future, and I don't know what to do. I have a lot of things going on at the moment, and I don't have the emotional energy to pour them into this post, but I have no-one to talk to about them. I am losing connection with my family because of their expectations of my achievement and lack of understanding for the issues outlined above. It's only me and my belt, and the comfort that beating myself brings. I don't want it to be like this. Strangers of the internet, can you hear me?",18Mar2019,2
63,"So I took a year off because I had a surgery. Applied for improvement exam in maths since the previous year I didn't do exactly how I wanted to in the boards. Had time to practice alot of maths and get alot of concepts into my brain. 

Had a good year off, then the time for the exam came along. Had a horrible stomach ache. Couldn't even get up from bed. Missed the exam. Cried alot because I missed something I've been preparing for for quite a long time. Later on saw the question paper and I knew there were alot of questions there I could answer. Thereby increasing my marks from the previous year. Felt so bad not being able to go for the exam. Cried like a baby. Dad comes home, (seems a little disappointed I missed the exam) tells me it's alright, concentrate on my next entrance exam to pursue my dream career. Tells me I don't need to cry over spilt milk because it wont help now.

That's when I realise that I'm crying over something so trivial. There are people in the world crying because they don't have food to eat, no one to take care of them, in constant fear of not being able to live another day. I realise that if I cry over something like missing a relatively unimportant exam, I'm really weak and can't handle life. I'm now up and motivated because I know what I'm capable of. And that I need to be strong and pursue my dreams and not cry over something so trivial. Just knowing that I could answer those questions and knowing that I have progressed makes me feel motivated. Demoralised because I could have maybe shown it in a marksheet. But deep down I know what I'm capable of. 

I Love my parents and friends so much because they really helped me deal with this too. I feel so blessed to have them in my life. I don't know what I'd do without them.

Sorry for such a long meaningless post. I just wanted to post this because in a brief amount of time I changed from being conpletely demoralised to feeling motivated and cheerful. I hope there are people out there who have had this kind of experience too. I hope you all have a good day and a great life ahead!!",18Mar2019,0
64,"I am struggeling with depressions my whole life and i never learned to commit to something. I try to explain what i mean. I go to the gym since 7 years. It's always the same, i start with making a plan and want to stick to it. Often it looks like every second day i go to the gym with specific exercises and post workout meal etc. I mean i do it with 110%. I can stick to that mostly a month or so, then i keep getting rid of all that and do nothing instead. I feel a bit exhausted, what i totally understand. I cant go from 0 to 110%. But when i try to do it like 1 time a week and everthing else is extra, i feel kinda wrong. Like i miss something to get success.
I Just have no connection to longterm success, i never felt that. In theory i know that stuff, but my brain always tells me i need success now to be happy. It is always looking for a shortcut. I never learnt more then 8 hours for an exam in my University. So my brain knows nothing else then do something and here is your reward, like instand.

I tried to explain my situation as short as possible, and i feel like i need to learn to fucking commit to something stay with it and 1 year later seeing success. But i cant even stick to read one page of a book a day. Not even this simple commitment :(

67,"
The warm air washes upon my face as I steadily climb the gentle hill , the path covered with unkempt grass and dry dirt. My mind is void of thought as I focus solely on moving forward. My pack sits neatly upon my shoulders, I lean it against my hip to displace the weight. It's work, but the work that I aspire to - the work that hinges on the inner soul and not being a in debt to the world. My legs burn and I embrace it, thinking of keeping pace and staying steady above all else. 

Around a gentle curve, I plod along and look out to see the mountains in the distance. I admire their green broccoli like texture and think about how plentiful they are. I think of all the people in India , the countless people of the world I will never meet. I think about how I'm just this tiny speck in the universe  and how I need to assess what I count as a measure for a 'successful life'. The trees are tall and spaced out, the ground declines a bit , relieving my legs. I see a rock formation up ahead and wonder at the majesty of nature. I think of the stress at work, I think of the smiling faces of my sons and wife. Where am I supposed to be right now? Where do I need to spend my time? I readjust my pack, I tighten the cinches so there is less slack and I move onward.

The water makes a glugging sound as I walk and I think about how to ration it, so I do not go thirsty. The amount of time I've spent thinking about this trip, about how to prepare for it and what equipment not to bring - I try to remember only to think about what I actually need. I find a spot to sit and eat, plop my stuff down next to a tree and lean against the tree, sitting on the soft dirt.

Relief. Presence. Away from the daemons that chased me to this spot. The best things in my life are tiny points of goodness amid chaos and a plenitude of that which I do not want to do, but have to settle for. In this moment, I am myself - but am I? Am I  a product of those stresses or is there an integral part of me. Have I found myself in this place as a result of what has pushed me there - the lack of knowing and trusting myself - or is this the place that I actually want to be? The inner struggle is inescapable and I think about a way to distract myself. I glance up at the branch of a tree and admire the light shining through. My bandanna is soaked and feels cool on my forehead. 

I wish I brought a fishing rod, but didn't want to spring for it. The joint in my pack is waiting for me for after I get to camp and I wonder if that's something that I actually want - or if it's a respond to a stress in the world. I enjoy thinking about detaching from the world further, into a void - floating in the in between space. I sit and wait until I've rested enough and throw the pack back on. 

A few more miles to go, a few more thoughts about the meal at the end. My feet feel comfort in the simple squish of the muddy section of the trail I pass through. I love how the challenge, the difficulty draws my attention away from the stresses of the world. I look forward to having my sons join me on these hikes, when they grow older. It's hard to think about that right now with all that is going on - it's hard to think about the future when the present is so stressful. I can still hear cars in the distance, no matter how hard I try to get away , the highway persists.

I pack on a few more miles and come to a pond. Sitting down by the water, I get my water kit out and start to filter and refill my bottles. There's nothing like sitting and working on something that's simple and you care about - without a rush. Having enough time is all that anyone ever needs. Time is the ultimate currency. ""Enough"". That term haunts me as I wonder about my priorities and how my abilities in life have determined the options before me. Am I great or am I delusional?

Emerson's words about believing in yourself echo in my mind. Speak your truth or wait until someone else does. The world carries me away from the ideas that I know would change the world. Constantly fighting the current, I wonder if this time would be better spent in a hotel room writing. My fortitude wains as life distracts me and I waiver between focus on dreams and needs.

All my friends are unhappily single and I hate that they feel so lonely, so I don't want to make it any worse by sharing this with them... But i gotta share it. 

My husband is at a business conference in another State, somewhere I had never been, with pretty cool natural scenery. This man. Flew me out here for the DAY, right before his conference, just so I could go hiking through the desert with him (I LOVE hiking).

Everything went wrong when we arrived---the hotel never got our reservation, and all the hotels in the area were full bc of several professional sports games. That could have been shitty, but it wasn't, cuz we're a freaking team!! We made a bed in the trunk of the car, drove to the place we were gonna hike the next day, and slept there. Needless to say we were the first people to arrive on the trail. 

While walking through the wilderneaa, we saw wild horses, a gila monster(!!!), several rattlesnakes (don't worry were careful), gorgeous natural rock formations, and a beautiful sunset. 

Right now I'm here in the other hotel (the one his job had booked for the conference), about to fly home by myself, thinking about how fucking lucky I am to have a partner like this dude. Someone who would spend (what we both think is a lot of) money on the shortest trip ever, just so we can explore someplace together. And shit always goes wrong, but that's life, right? We always find a way to make it work. 

So yeah that's all i wanted to share. I fucking love my husband, I'm so glad I married him, and I hope everyone reading this finds someone who makes you as happy as I feel. Everyone deserves to feel this way. ♥️

75,"As the title says, I've been let down. Since late-December, I've been planning a trip to Japan with my friend. In mid-January, we agreed on that I'd take care of all the planning, booking etc. All I requested from him, was that he'd apply for vacation and check up on relevant insurances. 

None did he do until 2 weeks ago- early March. He had been procrastinating it, while planning other things to do with other people. I trusted that he'd do his part, and was shocked to hear that he didn't do anything. Yesterday was when I finally knew he was not going with me.

Now. I've never flown in my life, never visited an airport or been abroad before. This was going to be a special trip with my bestest of friend. Going alone wouldn't be a problem, hadn't huge airports shown to be such an intimidating obstacle. I haven't talked about canceling my vacation, with my boss, yet- but I don't see any other option.

A year ago I broke up with my boyfriend of 4years. This winter I quit my studies in university I had been doing for 1.5 years. Ever since, I‘m just floating, so many possibilities but I don’t have passion for anything, I don‘t strive for anything.

He said he was curious about me, because I‘m so calm, don’t need to talk so much, unlike his girlfriend. She doesn’t believe in monogamy but she is jealous.  He wants sex, other than that, I don’t think he knows what he wants. It‘s dangerous, so many people intervined not knowing what they want.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a white, male German living in Germany. This afternoon i took the bus into the city center. A young couple stood close to me, i spotted the ""Skin"" tattoo on the guys hand grasping his beer can the moment i entered; apart from this they were normal looking. Then he started complaining that those (insert racistic slur) don't get up when they entered, yadayada. I turned around and told him to stop that. He started to rant about Free Speech and not being a racist but a neo-fascist and that i should shut up and the jewish world conspiracy (really!) and a lot bullshit more.

Here is what i'm proud of: i stayed calm, i refuted his arguments, pointed out his contradictions and stood my ground when he threatened me. When he started to insult me i could laugh honestly about it (this was when he said i haven't even fucked a woman in my whole life :) - the last girlfriend and i were fucking each others brains out for years). I couldn't do anything but laugh wholeheartedly!

After i left the bus another guy told me that he agreed totaly with me and how important it is to stand up against such people.

82,"It's been a few weeks since I had my heartbroken by someone who I thought actually cared about me. During that time, I spent hours thinking about the what-ifs, the could've-beens, the should've-beens, etc. It took some late night talks with a couple of friends to make me realize that I did nothing wrong in my time with the person who hurt me. Granted, there are still some thoughts that creep into my head every now and then but, it's not as loud as it used to be. I took a close friend's advice of self-improvement and disengagement. She told me that if I took the path of silence, no reactions to anything this person does now, or just ignore her completely, and pursued new interests that would help improve my person, the universe would end up doing the work for me (her words: ""If you sow positivity and optimism into the world, you'll reap only positivity in return). Over the past couple of weeks, I've been trying to teach myself Tai Chi and learning how to use Kali sticks. It's definitely not the easiest way to learn any sort of martial arts but, just practicing the movements, working on footwork and stick coordination, have really helped improved my mood. Kali, especially, has made me even more motivated to learn the art; I've started dedicating at least 30 or so minutes to it at the end of my morning work out routine. So, in a way, the universe is already working for me because I've found more things to inspire me to become a better version of myself; not to wallow in sadness but, rather, enjoy the time I have now to continue to improve.

&amp;#x200B;

In fairness, I'm still working on convincing that tiny voice in my head (who keeps telling me that she's better off without me) that none of what happened was my fault at all. That even though I'm feeling like I was the one tossed out into the street (she has a new boyfriend now), that I did nothing wrong towards her. I was kind, giving, caring, and loving but, I ended up getting used. It could be the fact that I was genuine with her and then proceeded to get played like a fiddle that my mind is still having a difficult time processing.

84,"I'm currently getting ready to apply for professional school. My grades aren't the most competitive, so I've also applied to master's programs that would boost my chances if I don't get into professional school this upcoming cycle. I know I fucked up my undergraduate career a lot to get to this point, but I don't think I'm *unable* to get into professional school because of my grades. Even if it takes another cycle or two. If I don't get in by the third or fourth time I try, then it'd be pretty obvious by then that the career I wanted to get into isn't the one I'll be able to pursue, and I'll change career paths accordingly. But I haven't even tried yet. The application cycle is about to open up in a few months.

I've discussed this with my parents, who have been supportive, but also very down to earth about my situation. They're always telling me to have a plan B, C, D, etc. However, they aren't very sure about my prospects for professional school, and have repeatedly told me to begin pursuing other careers in the field of my undergraduate (biology). Thing is, I honestly don't care to go into research or education for biology. It never interested me. But they're pushing me to pursue these alternatives more than me trying to get into professional school. I get it. Why waste time trying for something I'm unsure of, when I could be working towards something more concrete? But I fucking hate it. It's like they already gave up on my chances. And I know, I keep telling myself that they're just saying these things because it would realistically be part of my plan b, c, d, etc., but it hurts to always hear that I should just give up trying for something I haven't even got the chance to try for.

88,"All my life I’ve done horrible in school, I couldn’t pay attention in class and sitting still for hours at a time was torturous. I hated church I hated meetings and hated classes because I couldn’t pay attention and sit still long enough. I know a lot of people struggle with this so I never thought much of it but I was saddened because partly this is why I struggled academically. 

All my life my mom would say I had adhd like she did and my dad would hear nothing of it. He said it was a dumb thing to say and it was something you could train yourself to get over instead of getting professional help.  He also basically said add was a made up disorder to blame your problems on so I felt stupid even thinking I had it. 

I’ve been an extreme procrastinator all my life and when it came to any kind of project or responsibilities I would push it back as long as possible. When I was younger it affected my grades and now that I’m older I’m starting to see real life consequences because of it.  I’m messy and I can’t concentrate the only work place I’ve thrived in is my current job. I work as a waitress in a large high volume entertainment venue. When it’s slow I get restless and depressed but when we get busy I tend to enjoy myself. I don’t want to be a waitress all my life so that’s where the problem is. I haven’t found enough motivation to go back to school because school has always been hard for me and I don’t know what I want to do in life. I also don’t want to have a career in a office type setting where I’m sitting down most of the day and doing meetings. I want to be able to move around and do different things throughout the day. 

Im 22 now and live on my own and I almost feel like my problems are hindering more than they did when I was in school. I can’t find the motivation to do anything and I have extreme procrastination. It’s gotten to the point where I’ve forgotten to file my taxes I’ve let my license be expired for months. Any kind of errand I need to do I can’t bring myself to do.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I found an alternative to pass though my shyness, when I'm coming home, I always take some food and drink while watching random streamer on twitch (usually small streamer between 5 and 20 viewers), instead of simply watching them now, I usually always find something I like in them like their voice, accent or simply how friendly they seem like, and told them in chat and this is the best things ever.

Its like, bringing them pur happiness, when they stream facecam you can see them smiling more than ever, some of them sound like more confident and 99% of the times you can tell they are more joyful than they were.

91,"For a number of different reasons, mainly strong social anxiety and bad luck, I wasn't able to make any friends after entering high school. I tried at first, but it didn't work and people started talking to me less and less. It reached the point where I could go an entire day without saying a single word to anyone besides my parents. I didn't have a single friend or   acquaintance, I was alone. 

During this time, I often felt miserable. I'd always had friends before, I knew how nice it could be, and I felt like I was wasting my youth by missing out on all of the experience people my age made through their social life. I started seeing a therapist, and it helped me a lot. My soxial anxiety now is nothing compared to what it used to be, I can speak normally to people (usually), and I've become a lot happier.

The one thing I've continued to wish for, though, is a friend. I want someone besides my parents to talk to, someone my age that shares my interests and sense of humor, someone I can make some kind of (social) experiences with. I couldn't find anyone, though, and I thought it would stay like this for a while, until a girl from my school, one I didn't know, suddenly started talking to me, saying she ""thought we could be friends"".

I felt a little wary at first, but I was happy: it was like a dream come true, I finally had someone to talk to. We walked home together a couple of times and chatted online on most days. Talking to her took less effort than I thought it would, and I never really fucked anything up, so I thought it was going well. Our conversations weren't completely fluid, but I was confident that that would go away if we just got to know each other better. Once my initial nervousness died down, though, my excitement died with it. 

Even though we have several of the same interests and she seems like a nice person, I feel like talking to her has become a pain. I have to force myself to come up with topics to talk about, I don't feel like I'm really interested in her as a person and I find most of our conversations boring. All in all, I just don't feel like we click. 

This has made me feel pretty shitty. I've desperately longed for any social contact for years, why is this how I feel when I finally get it? Maybe my expectations were too high, maybe I'm not ready for this kind of social interaction, maybe I don't know her well enough yet, maybe I'm overreacting, and maybe our personalities just don't fit. I don't know. I just feel like I want to *get rid of her*.

I mean, I definitely won't, I'd never pass up this kind of opportunity after what I've gone through, but I *want to*. And I'm afraid that it'll show on my face, that it'll make me worse at talking to her, that I'll end up all alone again.

My idea is a video camera hooked up to a small telescope/spotting scope so that it monitors a very small section of road. I know there are security cameras that detect any change in the screen (like when someone walks into view) , so I figure this would work. When a vehicle passes the small section of what the telescope sees..... it triggers an alert.

I know that there are driveway alert motion devices but they are a pain to implement. They don't work over long distances unless they are wired or have pointed antennas or are hooked up to a cellphone dialer. Plus... being exposed they are subject to theft or vandalism.

This security device I am wanting has to be somewhat portable. To be able to be set up and left for hours and then broken down and removed.   

I wonder if there is an app that uses a cellphone's camera as a security device  that records and then  alerts when the field of view has changed.

How ?",18Mar2019,4
96,"Not sure where else to post this. Using a throwaway for obvious reasons. 

To make it simple and to the point, the website Omegle is used by pedophiles as a trading hub for child porn. It is present on text chat as well as the adult unmoderated video chat. I was exposed to this trading ring on the unmoderated video chat recently when a person that Omegle connected me to played a video with a simulated camera (this is when the stranger displays a video uploaded from their computer rather than a live feed from their webcam) of a child being raped. They had also typed ""want more? put in 'send, receive, as your likes on txt chat."" As soon as I realized what I was looking at, which took me a few seconds, I tore my eyes from the screen and immediately disconnected from the chat. I followed up on their message and switched to text chat with those two interests. For those unfamiliar with Omegle's text chat, it will connect you to users who have inputed the same interests, obviously to foster conversations between strangers. Sp, sure enough, Omegle connected me to other users with the same interests, ""send"" and ""receive"". Once connected with a user, I tried asking if this is where they get child porn. They disconnected, and I realized I had to not sound like a narc. Once I connected with another, I let them type first, and their first message was ""STR"", which I came to learn means ""send to receive."" This means send child pornography to receive child pornography. I disconnected and connected with another user, and received the same message. I kept disconnecting and reconnecting to get an idea of how consistent this was, and it did not fail. If they don't say ""STR"" they say ""send or leave"", or ""go"". They will also add a preference for male or female, saying ""b"" for boy and ""g"" for girl. If you say it back, they will disconnect, because they said it first so it is on you to send a link first. This leads me to believe this has been going on for an extended period of time, as the users have adapted to patterns and developed some sort of system to find others who want what they want. As I continued to connect and disconnect, a user sent first, presumably hoping that I would send more back, and I saw how the child porn is traded and viewed; through web links to Dropbox folders, MEGA folders, Chatzy chatrooms, and Russian VK links. I viewed one folder before I could not bear to witness anymore, but the other few ones that were sent to me I assume contained the same material. This was a few weeks ago and I have been trying to get the images and knowledge of this out of my mind, as it burns and makes me feel like dying. I decided to confront it and tell people in the hopes that something could be done about it, as I have no idea where to start except here. My hope is that it is brought to the attention of Omegle, Dropbox, Chatzy, Mega, and VK, and they shut down this content. If you think I am lying, check for yourself, but be cautious, this shit is extremely scarring. 

TL;DR: People trade child porn on Omegle via links to Dropbox, Mega, VK, and Chatzy folders, I found this out by being exposed to child porn on Omegle's unmoderated video chat.",18Mar2019,96
97,"This is not an anti-social media message. I think social media over all makes communication more visual and instantaneous. There are obvious drawbacks, but I think overall it's a net win and we will never go back to not having social media. BUT. ~~It was making me miserable~~  I was miserable for a couple of reasons.

1. None of the connections felt meaningful.
2. I didn't like having all of the contacts, professional and personal, all in one place.
3. I was using it to cope with social inadequacies.

My desire to delete my social media spawned from working on day and seeing three older men come into my lobby. Having never met each other, they started a conversation and within 15 minutes it sounded like they'd known each other for years. It's something I think my generation missed out on, because anytime I'm in a room with dudes my age, even if we have a mutual connection, we'll all just pull out our phones and scroll. So my first reason for deleting it was to create organic relationships in real time. So far, I've spent every weekend the last two months out with friends instead of playing games and eating at home all day.

Another reason that reinforced my decision to leave was a series of arguments among mutual contacts whenever I'd post something. I didn't want to scroll past hateful messages everyday from people that I know in real life.

But something changed. And it's intangible, and I can't explain what it is. But when you talk to people more, something changes about your demeanor and people can recognize it. More people approach me than they have in recent years, and the thought of conversation doesn't scare me. I feel like a character in a movie who knows everybody in town.

Socializing is a muscle. I'm not saying delete your social media and it'll make your problems go away, but if you find yourself scrolling a feed to avoid conversation, you might wanna try deleting it.",18Mar2019,24

I'm exhausted giving everything I have and people ignore me. I try to start a conversation asking how they are and nothing... for days... Just tell me you're busy or stop accepting my kindness.

100," My dad, Jeff Edwards, is a Methodist minister in New Jersey. He's a deeply loving and compassionate person who goes out of his way to care for the down and out. Over his career he has created thriving community of openness and acceptance at his church, the home for a thriving LGBTQ and minority diverse community despite the hostility towards homosexuality by the Methodist Church at large. 

He hates big banks, Wall Street, etc, and believes vehemently in telling the truth. 

And he gets easily stressed out about money.

So....

In April of 2018, **my** **dad deposited his checks** into the ATM at Wells Fargo, as he’s been doing regularly for the past ten years.

That same day, four fraudulent checks were deposited at that same ATM as part of a check fraud scheme by someone named *'Cousin Swing.'*

Police subpoenaed Wells Fargo for photos of the person depositing the checks. They said they could not automatically link the checks to security footage but would review their data and send photos of the person they believed had deposited the counterfeited checks.

**But the bank sent photos of my father,** with the fake check numbers written on the bottom of the images, falsely linking his image to the fake checks rather than this *'Cousin Swing'* guy. 

The police put out a search, posting my dad's image all over their facebook and multiple local radio stations. 

Unbeknownst to us, the police interrogated *'Mathis'* (the account holder) who **gave a description of** *'Cousin Swing'* a person who claimed would split the money once depositing the checks into the account.

**They look nothing like my dad.** 

Two weeks later the same check fraud event occurred at a nearby branch where an ATM photo was recorded of the perpetrator **matching this description of 'Cousin Swing'.** 

So...

When my dad finds out about this (someone from his congregation sent him the link) he went to the police to clear his name, bringing his bank statements.

**When he arrived they interrogated him, arrested him and charged with third degree forgery.** 

**When he protested and said somebody made an error, they said ""if the case did go to trial, who would the jury believe -- a bank security expert or him?""**

After a long hard year the case has finally been dropped. It is mind boggling the level of incompetence at both the police level and at the bank, and absurd that we live in a society where the police trust the bank's 'expert' over their own evidence. 

As my dad put it, **""I wonder what happens to somebody who might not have the resources to defend themselves”**

My father is now bringing a lawsuit against both Wells Fargo and the Police Department.

Two weeks ago he moved in with my mom, who is 67 and semi-retired, she still does 15-25 hours of accounting work at home a week for extra money. But she's the only of his three kids who's retired, and lives nearby with my stepdad, and they had a spare bedroom so they took him in.

It's been rough for them. He is angry that he's losing his independence, first it was the car and now it's his house. He's fussy and cranky and hell, at 92 I would be too! But it's rough on my mom who is trying to work and take care of him. My stepdad can't help much as he has health problems of his own, he can take care of himself but he has lots of joint problems and has had lots of surgeries.

I got her a few books on aging parents to try to help, since she loves to read. And I got my granddad some books that he'd like, as he was apparently bored and that made him take up more of my mom's time, but he loves to read. That's only a passing distraction.

I knew she had some caretakers for him but I looked into paying for her to have a weekly housecleaning service -- it wouldn't help with day to day cleaning issues (he has bladder and bowel issues and, yeah) but would take some of the bigger work off her. I knew before she was resistant to having help in her house but I could tell she was really struggling with adapting these past few weeks, and it was a lot more work for her while she was also trying to work.

Turns out I was too late in that she already had house cleaners! My aunt and uncle (her siblings) had an intervention and got her to hire a weekly house cleaner, and up his care time from twice a week at 4 hours to 3 times a week at 6 hours. They all agreed, my granddad included, that he could pay for it, as he has the finances for it and was paying for help at his house before.
