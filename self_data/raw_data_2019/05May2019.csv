0,"You all know how people who call out racism that isn't actually racism are kinda racists themselves. Well, someone posted a meme abt a black guy (it was a 'i am the captain now' meme), and a friend very dear to my heart retweeted it and said it was racist. Nothing dramatic, just a funny, harmless meme.

I personally thought of it as not racist at all, and now I am questioning how this friend defines 'racism' as. Also, I am questioning how I define it myself. I'd love to talk abt it (i love philo discussions), but I'm scared he might get offended.

But seriously, there is much worse cases of racism than an avengers and i am the captain now crossover meme.",05May2019,2

5,"A very close family of mine has been depressed and suicidal. They are the type of person you'd never expect it from, and for the last few weeks they have been acting erratically. Not scary, or dangerous, or dark behavior, just behavior that isn't typical for them.

It has been chewing at the back of my mind for a few weeks, and I've been meaning to talk to them about it when the time was right, but I just ignored it.

Well their SO didn't ignore it, and now my loved one is safe and getting medical treatment. When I found out what happened, without details, and I looked back at the weird behavior &amp; messages I received and suddenly it all snapped together and I realized they were suicidal, crying desperately for someone to help, and that its exactly how they would cry for help based on the fact they always try to appear strong. I start crying like a baby when I realized I had let it slip, because I knew something was off and I just thought I'd have time to talk to them soon.

Thankfully everything is OK for the time being, but if someone you love starts acting strangely, don't fuck up like I did and put off talking to them, or reaching out. This person isn't the type of person who would fake an attempt for attention. If they were going to do it, they'd have done it. I came so close to losing them because I was busy with work, and even though it kept chewing at my mind that something was wrong... I just thought they weren't that kind of person, and that they were too strong to be depressed/suicidal. I just thought they were having fun, relaxing a little bit more than usual, and enjoying their success in life.

I am so angry and disappointed with myself. Don't let it happen to you. If you think something is wrong act now. Pick up the phone. Call their friends. Get to the bottom of it.",05May2019,108

I was hired at my internship and now have a full time job, great healthcare and  a good salary.

I work second shift and never get to see my family (my job makes you start on second and then filter down to first, I am now second in line and I was seventh.)

What I'm less sure about is a line that went somewhere Ong the lines of ""stopping breathing in the middle of the night"". I've been looking up some things, but I'm sure that somebody here would be able to tell me more. I'm worried. I don't want to ask my parents because I know they'll get mad at me for listening in.

Only work was a chiicken plant that I hated working at. I had a job up here that let me go after a week because I didn't have enough experience. Wife quit where she was working because she was being harrased very badly. Now neither of us have a job. 

Her parents are trying to move out because the old lady will not allow us to use anything on other side of house including kitchen. Now we are 5 deep in a small apartment connected to house without a fridge or working stove. Can't keep my baby milk cold without an icechest. Mother gave us her car now she needs it because hers is about to quit on her.

 Dad offered to help us get into an apartment or a uhaul back home and back to an awfull job which I don't mind because I have a child to take care of but my wife is freaking out making me stress sooo much more. She thinks we can ask my dad for money for an apartment and a car. Doesn't want to go back to living with my mom because she doesn't want to be a baby sitter stuck at home which I understand but I don't have many options.

Problem with getting our own apartment is I won't have a car to commute to a job and she doesn't want to be left without a car. I'm so stressed put. It isn't good for my relationship with my wife but at this point I have to do what I can to take care of my son. God....

Mind you I’m 18, and sleeping over at my grandparents for spring break downstate. And I’m in the car with my uncle, my uncle is a high hog class man and he wants me to take his car to go get bagels after we get to the house for construction work. I tell him I don’t have a license. He asks me “well you have cash right?” I reply “no.” “Well I’ll text you when..” and at that moment he realized I don’t have a phone either m.. like WHATT THE FUCK. At that moment I felt like a child. 18 without a license or cash like what’re you doing with your life you fucking loser type shit damn!!

What really makes this suck is that I *want* to be able to drive; I want the freedom, and I don't want to be that dipshit who's still asking mommy and daddy for rides (though I love them dearly &lt;3) I know that once I get good at it, it'll be second nature and I'll probably be fine.

21,"I had a flat.  Went to Costco to get the auto department to fix the flat.  Costco charges anywhere from 10 to 15 to fix a flat, I think.  I don't know why the variable, but I just had a different tired fixed at the same Costco by a different guy and it was lower price.  

Said I needed a flat fixed.  I could have had them just put the spare on.  Auto manager said that I should pay up front and if they couldn't fix the flat, they would refund the money.  I was getting weird vibes from the manager.  His demand sounded weird with a rude tone is his voice.  I said just tell me if you can fix it first.  He said no.  Then he gave me an ultimatum of having it fixed or not.  

Who likes to be intimidated or bullied?  I went inside the store and spoke with the Assistant Manager.  He called the Auto Department and told him to look at my car before demanding payment.  I also told the Assistant manager that I was going to buy four Michelins in a few days when they had them on sale.   The Assistant manager gave me the discount a few days early.  

The auto center manager's friend helped me and told me that the Assistant manager gave me the sale price early because he ""understood my situation.""  I told him, no he didn't.  He did it because the Assistant manager told him to do it.  I was sitting next to the Assistant manager when he did.  

The Auto Center sold me four new tires and gave me a paper to come in between this date and this date for my refund.  I came in recently and received my discount.  They were going to give it to me on a Costco card and make me buy Costco products, but I told them I gave them cash, they give me cash back and I got my cash.

Question:  Should I still write a letter of complaint about the way the Auto Center manager bullied me?  He wasn't the one to make the discount a few days early.  The assistant manager was.  And I think the auto manager bullied me because he was prejudiced about my weight.",05May2019,2

25,"I started working with the Crisis Text Line recently. I got the idea because of a suicide attempt this winter (now much better).

It's really hard to help some people because it can remind me of what I felt or be objectively unsettling. Nothing shook me until last night.

Her first text was, ""I'm going to kill my daughter."" We have a lot of people who wanna die, but that was my first homicidal client. I said all of the lines I was supposed to say. My supervisor and I started looking for information so that the police could respond.

My next goal was deescalation. But before I could start that, she said, ""I just killed her."" She then revealed her schizophrenia and desire to suicide by cop. Because of the nature of our company, I don't know if anyone else died that night.

I know I can't blame myself. But it's certainly a new feeling, trying to stop a murder and failing. It's funny because a few months ago, I thought the only death I'd ever be involved in was my own.",05May2019,7
26,"So let me open this by saying I’m open to feedback/debate regarding this post. 

I’ve found myself really struggling with my own mortality after a bout of recent suicidal thoughts. I think they were largely due to a string of unfortunate circumstances, that have made stumbling into my adult life increasingly more difficult. 

It is my personal belief, that anyone who has felt close to the end, has asked themselves one question: 

What happens next? 

I’ve become obsessed with the topic as of late, and I need a community to share my thoughts with. I’m not sure if this is a cry of my subconscious, or a coping mechanism, but please feel free to catch this glimpse into my theory. 

I believe that we die, and we experience dying, but not death. Now bear with me while I try to explain. 

I believe there is a fourth dimension, and that it is represented by “true time”. I’m not sure if this has been discussed before, but I define it in the following way: 

Because we cannot see “true time”, we see it as a straight line. For example: Your day starts with you waking up, and ends with you going to sleep. 

However in the 4th dimension of “true time”, time is more like looking into a night sky. Each moment happening simultaneously. For example: You’re waking up while the universe begins, and ends, and you’re being born, and you’re at baseball practice being yelled at for forgetting your glove. 

That being said, if the 4th dimension is real, and time is really a continuous jumble of simultaneous moments; I don’t believe we will ever be able to process that. I also believe we have no control over these moments. We are stuck in a continuous loop of time, living our lives over and over again. 

Though this can seem bleak, I believe if we try to enjoy the little moments of joy in our lives we can try to make the loop more bearable, knowing we will be able to visit those moments again. 

*Trigger warning* 

I think if people tried to adopt this way of thinking, more people would find some amount of happiness in life. 

Personally, I can’t blind myself enough to believe that there is a guy in the sky waiting to make me feel better and give me happiness.

28,"I never sit still while in class, I’m always moving. I squirm in my seat, rapidly bounce my feet, and hit my fist into my leg or painfully scratch my arms. It’s like I can’t help it, it’s really annoying and distracting, I’m constantly shifting in my seat, crossing and un crossing my legs. Turning to the side, sliding butt back and forth across the seat or sometimes I even bounce lightly in my chair. It makes school so much worse for me because I dread certain classes that make me feel like this. I get this sensation throughout my body and it’s so uncomfortable (for lack of a better word).

 I also never pick up social cues, it’s hard for me to tell if people are making fun of me or not and I can never tell if someone is joking or being serious. After talking to my boyfriend this week I’ve realized that my “friends” in one of my classes have just been making fun of me. They treat me as if I’m a “special”. Hell, one of them called me an “autist”. And it took several days to realize that it wasn’t a joke, when he said it at the same I just smiled his way and kept doing what I was doing.

32,"I apologize all the time and feel guilty for everything, like asking to borrow a pencil, or accidently coughing too loudly, or even just speaking in class because it feels like a waste of everyone's time (even when I think I made a good point).  I  feel responsible for people's emotions and if they are sad I feel I should have done something differently to prevent it. I am constantly embarrassed by everything that escapes from my lips. My movements seem weird and wrong. I cannot look people in the eye for very long and I am told I hold my shoulders up to my ears. I also am the biggest people pleaser, never say no, and am extremely eager to impress and please those in authority. I am also a perfectionist and a master procrastinator and base a lot of my worth on my intellect. I also develop the most intense and irrational obsessions with unavailable people, like married men and teachers. Sexually, I have sought out sex with strangers as well as much older men, even though I do not like sex, just because I crave male validation so much. And I have put myself in very dangerous situations and done things I did not want to do, because I felt uncomfortable and guilty saying no. I had a not so great childhood, with verbal and sexual abuse, and that, plus most likely a genetic predisposition toward anxiety and mood disorders, contributed to who I am. 

  
ALL THAT ASIDE, I actually have a weirdly high opinion of myself so it always confuses me when people say, learn to love yourself. Because I do love myself. Well I think I'm pretty cool, at least. I think I'm charming, sexually attractive, mature, empathetic and sometimes even brilliant. In a word, I think I'm ""special."" I know how deluded that sounds, and I'm sure it is to some extent, however it is also, I think, a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy. I really *am* special, though not conspicuously so, and those that know me always comment on it. It's not that surprising, though, since I have spent so much time in my youth cultivating this ""specialness"" in myself. It's sounds so phony and un-appealing but the more I think about it the more I think it is a deeply human, and harmless, thing to do, in moderation at least. I am similarly confident in my ability to attract men, to 

Now that I write this out I am realizing the areas where I do hate myself. I think I have a pretty rotten and phony character. But most of what I hate are legitimately bad traits that could use fixing. For instance, I lie a lot about small things because I'm afraid or ashamed or just feel like I can get away with it. I like to keep secrets and do bad things secretly and feel little remorse. I steal small things all the time and sneak and snoop when other people would not. I also feel no guilt about cheating academically, as long as I don't get caught, and that scares me. I almost never do it but that's just because I don't have the opportunity or desire to, not because I think it's important to be honest. I also dislike myself for caring so much about what others think and for cultivating a false self. I hate that I crave attention so much and that I will lie or exaggerate to get it. I hate that I'm so manipulative and that everyone thinks I am so nice and humble and kind when in reality I am way more narcissistic and self-absorbed than most. I also think I am pathetic for sleeping around and for starting to smoke cigarettes to look ""cool"" and ""experienced."" Finally, I hate my victim mentality, which has me addicted to being the victim and receiving sympathy and obsessed with my childhood traumas and with ""proving"" to everyone ""how bad I had it""  (though my shame about this secret desire usually stops me from ever disclosing, I still sometimes drop hints, and feel so stupid for doing it). I also really dislike my pervasive laziness and lack of self-discipline and my belief that I don't have that much control over my life. I know it's bad but it's hard to shake.",05May2019,2

I texted her this in the evening and I didn’t want to ruin the rest of my day in case I got rejected so I didn’t check Instagram till morning.

I checked in the morning and she was actually appreciative of the fact I took the time to ask her. However, she told me she was a pansexual homoromantic meaning she only dates people of her sex. But she also told me she thinks I’m a really awesome person and I told her the same. I told her I understood and she said she’s going with friends to prom so I said have fun.

I wasn’t even upset tbh. I was actually completely ok with this because I mean it is her choice after all but her telling me that was really brave of her. This is why I didn’t want to say anything in person because that might have been harder to tell me. It must’ve been hard to sort of come out like that but as good friends I support her a lot. It doesn’t matter whether she rejected me or not.

I’m still the same person I was yesterday if not better. My self esteem wasn’t hurt, I’m not depressed, and I’m still me. Luckily I kept it so down low that nobody knows about it so it’s not like I’m getting clowned or anything like I did when I got rejected in the past.

I'm not that popular in school or know a lot of people so I don't really understand why he would like me lol.

43,I’m a 17 year old male. And I’m a sensitive person. I have a big heart. I genuinely care for a lot of people. Recently life has been really hard. In March I broke down crying at school. Never done that before and I felt so ashamed and embarrassed for that happening. Today I got home late and when I walked into my room. I just started crying. I’m tired of being this way. I don’t want to be sad anymore. I hate it. I genuinely want to be happy. Most of the time I feel like giving up. But I know if I do. I’ll just bring more pain to the people who actually care about me and I can’t do that to them. I’m just stuck in this cycle.,05May2019,1
44,"So my best friend (M) has a crush on my other friend (F). She rejected him... I helped him with that and know he's a little bit better. The thing is, that I no longer talk with her as much, because I have stuff to do, or just hanging out with some friends. Since she rejected him, they've become really close friends. And because my best friend got fed up with her bullshit (because his friend backstabbed him, and he's now with her.) He decided to tell me all the stuff she told him. He started revealing that she's bi. Not a big deal. I wanted to know if it was true, so I texted her. She confirmed that indeed, she's bi. So, it's alright...  Curiosity got me and I decided to ask her how she knew she was bi. She told me that she liked a girl. I didn't ask any more details because it would be awkward. Then on Friday, my best friend, decides to reveal me that the girl my friend liked was me all along. This left me so confused. Because, he told me that she talks a lot of shit behind my back. And he has to agree with her because of not, she would reveal his secrets. So basically, she hates me but she likes me too. I knew it was weird when we became friends. She started having problems with her boyfriend and broke up with him. Started being really possessive with me and wouldn't let me talk or play videogames with my other colleagues. If I did this I would be ""ignoring her and hating her."" She would text me very very regularly. And when there was more trust she started hugging me, and touching my face out of the blue. I let her know that it made me a little bit uncomfortable, and she got pissed... I stopped talking to her because all of this. When I decided to not talk to her again, it was like December or January 2018.  My best friend was telling me that she would talk mad shit about me behind my back because I stopped talking to her. But when I would talk to her normally she seemed happy, like it never happened... It was this Friday that my best friend told me she likes me. And it creeped me out because he told him this like in December, and she hid the fact that she likes me so well, that I had chills when he told me that on text. I didn't know how to react. Obviously I'm not going to tell her that I know, otherwise she would kill both me and my bff...",05May2019,3

47,"We’ve been extremely close friends for 13 years and they have two children, 8(S) and 10(D). Partly because of all of this CPS mess D ended up living with us for three weeks, and she and I developed a very close bond, she and I consider her my grandchild. Mom and Dad were pretty angry about CPS at first, but they realized they had really been f*cking up, thanked me for forcing their hand so they could get the services they really need, and they even both apologized to me that things had gone so far that I was put in that position. I’m a retired social worker and called CPS on people before, but never on two of my best friends. It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do in my life.

Fast forward to today. Since last year they’ve been living in an RV with the kids and have been planning to go somewhere cooler for the summer, and Dad called today to say they’re leaving town tomorrow and want to come by to pick up the rest of D’s stuff that she’d left at our house when we all thought she’d be back on weekends. Dad sounded hostile, so I asked what was going on. Well, Mom and Dad are both really angry again because of something I did a couple of weeks ago that they feel was yet another boundary violation, but instead of sitting down with me and having a calm, rational conversation to clarify what really happened, what my true motives were, they just got mad all over again and decided they were done being friends with me. This is completely out of character for our relationship, and even if they didn’t always start out being inquisitive and rational throughout this CPS mess, they’ve always gotten there pretty quickly, and even the really difficult, painful conversations have ended with us all feeling heard, understood, validated, and even closer. 

I had already prepared for the possibility that this decision would result in the end of the friendship, and if it were going to happen I figured it would have happened when they first found out I called CPS, but even then we were able to sit down and eventually discuss it all calmly, so I didn’t expect it this late in the game.

The hardest part for me isn’t even losing them though, it’s that they’ve decided I can no longer have any contact with their daughter, and I don’t know what they’ve told her, how they explained any of this to her. I’m afraid that because of how this has all gone down she’s going to feel like she did something bad by telling me what was going on, or that they’re going to make me out to her to be a bad, untrustworthy person.

I have no idea what’s going on with CPS as far as the extent of the services they’ve gotten, but it’s hard for me to believe that given how bad things had gotten by the time I called, enough has improved in such a short time to have them be ready to leave and be able to provide an emotionally and physically
healthy home for their children — maybe by CPS standards, in other words the legal minimum, but certainly not what I ever would have wanted for the family of my best friends.

And I know there’s nothing I can do about any of this anymore, and my heart hurts about losing my grandchild and her parents.",05May2019,6

50,"I’m 22 years old and I’ve only been in one relationship when I was 16 that didn’t even last a month.

I broke up with him because I realized I just wasn’t into all that lovey dovey stuff and honestly he was also moving on too fast with me, I met his family the day I became his girlfriend and was already planning our future 3 weeks in. Breaking up felt liberating (sorry dude). I’ve been happily single since then.

Lately I’ve been dreaming so much of my high school crush and unconsciously daydreaming about my celebrity crush. Or you know, just thinking about having a relationship.

I noticed how bad this was when I got into a new job, I have many coworkers but this dude in particular seems to be an extrovert and for some reason that got my eye and got really into him ONE DAY OF MEETING HIM. What?

This started to happen with many people, strangers that I wouldn’t have notice before make me nervous by only walking next to me. I went to my cousin’s birthday party and his best friend (that I knew was not my type) looked really fine now.

56,"Not entirely sure if this belongs on this thread (apologies if it doesn't) but I'm gonna try anyways.

Learned Friday that the landlord of the house me (21m), my sister and my parents are living in is being sold by month's end. Meaning we've til the 31st to find new residence. Why this is a conundrum is because if 2 choices with equal possibility of inevitable failure. I can either go to a new house with parents and keep living as I have now or find a nearby apartment and start living on my own. I currently have enough for a down payment on a reasonable apartment and enough for first month's bills and all. Though I'd be living from payday to payday more or less. I know that's just simply what it means to live on your own for some but I was hoping to have more time to give myself a safety cushion. Though it seems I'll have to put up every cent I have to make it work. Continuing to live with parents offers the very slim chance of being able to save. I say slim because they are not exactly positive influences and rely on me and my sister heavily financially. Yes since me and her live here it's fair to pay our end of the bargain but our parents are liabilities, my mother namely since she doesn't work and is an enabler for drug abuse.

 This is on top of me trying to get back in the swing of going to appointments regularly for my diabetes ,now that I've health insurance again, and having to start seeing a psychiatrist. Possible depression that I've always been curious about but I do definitely have anger issues and excessive apathy to evaluate. There's also the issue that this is the busy time of year at my workplace so I can't take off for the foreseeable future to get any of this done. Lots to do, very little time to do it. 

It's entirely possible that I come off as a whiney youth in the face of minor adversity but I face a crossroads that has come to me at alarming speed rather than me gradually approaching it with the finances to boot.",05May2019,1
58,"Can it be considered sexual harassment at work if the sexual inappropriateness is not being directed at me? I am a married man, and I work with a woman (who is also married) who is in the office next to me.  We have worked together for the last 7 years.  I consider us to be friends and more recently I have gotten to know her better over the last few months.  I have always known she likes to make sexually suggestive jokes with people, and in particular, there are two other men here that she focuses most of her attention on.  Now that I have become better friends with her, it is bothering me more having to listen to her interacting with these other two men.  It has gotten to the point that I get so uncomfortable with the types of conversations that I overhear from her office, or many times, directly at my door, or in my office, that it has affected my friendship with her.  That has caused her to retract a bit from our friendship, because I can be awkward or nervous when I am very uncomfortable from those types of conversations (And they have not been with me, just near me or in my presence many times).  I have been so bothered that our friendship is struggling over this that I finally confronted her about how uncomfortable I feel when I am forced to listen to sexually suggestive joking and other behaviors that make me uncomfortable.  She got angry with me, told me she will not apologize to me for who she is, joking is her thing and is what she does with close friends, male or female, inappropriate or not .  She said she doesn't think she is offending these friends that she has these types of conversations with.  She said if she making these kinds of jokes directly to me and I have been offended, then that would be a different thing and she said she is sorry if that has been the case.  But she said she refuses to stop interacting with her other friends the way she is comfortable doing so, and that it is not fair to ask otherwise (I never made any requests or accusations or anything, I just told her that I feel incredibly uncomfortable around those types of interactions).  

&amp;#x200B;

So for examples so you know the kinds of conversations that are happening that I have to listen to:

&amp;#x200B;

1. One of her friends sent her a meme that said ""Be the reason someone smiles today, or drinks, or masturbates... whatever works""  She called me into her office to show me because she thought it was so funny.  
2. She was in her office talking with one of these men, then she pounded on the wall because the other guy that she likes to talk to is in the office on the opposite side of us, and he came over and said ""I think I heard geese on the roof fighting"", and she replied ""Where they fighting or were they fucking?""
3. I have overheard many times in various conversations with people that she's ""flashing"" people, said in a way that I assume means she's just having wardrobe malfunctions or whatever, not actually intentionally flashing people.  But she likes to say that a lot. 
4. She had a conversation with one of these men and a third person directly outside my office door about a conversations she was having with this man and some other people, and there was a comment made about a sports team ""sucking"" and someone said ""does that mean you suck too"", referring to the woman, and she laughed about the extensive conversation that was had over that.  
5. I was at lunch with her and one of these other male friends, she for whatever reason thought a good topic of conversation would be her last gynecology doctor's visit and tell us about a comment the doctor made, something like ""as you approach your 50s"", and she went on and on for the rest of the lunch about her 50 year old pussy.

&amp;#x200B;

Those are just a few of the many  many many things I have to overhear.  My question is, is that considered sexual harassment when the topic or jokes are not directed at me, but I have to overhear all of it? I feel physically upset over it when it happens.  And I know the reason it bothers me so much more lately is because I have become closer friends with her.  It's that situation where I wouldn't care so much if I didn't care about the person.

59,"First post so sorry if it's worded badly.

Context: I'm a junior in high school

Anyway, the other day at lunch I was sitting with my main friend group and my friend (who I have a crush on and also has a crush on me but that's a post for another time) says she read a news article about how sleep deprivation can help depressed people, and that all she thought about was me. All of my friends agreed that sounds like me and I kinda just laughed it off, but I feel a little disheartened that my friends think of me that way. It's not the end of the world and I know that's not how they see me in general.

For context, I sleep 5-6 hours per night so it's really not that bad but all my friends get 8-10 and think it's weird that I dont sleep that much when I tell them that I feel better when I get 5-6 than 8-10. 

I don't really know what my point is with this post it's not as significant or interesting as other posts here but I don't really have anyone to discuss this kind of stuff with and it just feels nice to put it out there for someone else to hear/read.

Yesterday I graduated with my BS and I weighed myself for the first time since I was at that 125 mark. I'm back to what I believe is a comfortable weight of 170lbs, majority muscle. I'm loving myself again. I wouldn't have been able to do it without finding my sense of self worth again, and having the love and support of somebody that truly does care about me.

72,"I know one day I'll be better and I'm working on it but right now everything sounds like shit. I got a degree that hasn't been useful to me. I started taking classes to become a nurse and that didn't work out and I needed to move asap out of my dad's house because of emotional abuse and covert incest (still here though almost a year later cuz I have no way out) . So I got a FT job in a warehouse that was quite a commute from my house to save money. 

I then had 2 major car accidents in less than 3 months. I was resilient through the first one. I took everything a step at a time, paid for a rental so I could keep going to work (insurance wouldnt cover a rental because it's not covered under uninsured motorist, the guy who hit me was uninsured). The second accident broke me. I was starting to heal from the trauma when it happened again and now I can barely drive. I really liked that job despite it being in a warehouse but I couldn't do it anymore. 

So after just 4 months I was jobless again with no money because all of it went into my car and the rental. Then I went a month without a job because I wanted to buckle down and finally find something to use my degree. I applied to 1-3 places a day. I hustled. I got nowhere. Of all the places I applied to only three got back to me to tell me no. I never got an interview with any. Then my dad said I would need to start paying rent. He said maybe he shouldve been harder on me and my sister so that we would get out of his house earlier (I'm 22 my sister is 20). 

So that's forced me to go back to a warehouse job that is closer to my house. I start Monday. So what the fuck can I tell a room full of amazing, driven women that I've been up to?

I don’t know where or how it started, but it is always by my side gnawing away at every fiber of my being. My constant choices will feel like I made them without thought or care, even if I invested a serious amount of work or thought into them. Not because I just feel that way but because if someone mentions something that conflicts my actions I recesses into a pit or despair. To be honest 9/10 I feel as if I’m wrong. 

I know there is no way I can be wrong that much but the looks of others are overwhelming and I’m constantly looking away from people’s “judging” eyes. Their eyes burn deep into my soul making me question my every move.

What im trying to say is that everyone tries so hard to find meaning in their lives some go as far as to lie to themselves in order to be happy.

The power of a hug is unbelievable, for some reason a hug makes everything better. It provides security as you cry, calms you when you’re stressed or angry. It’s truly amazing how a simple embrace can do so much. It’s a sign of friendship, trust, compassion, and love.

\-Game of Thrones season 8;  
\-Avengers Endgame;

\-my tooth restoration broke and it hurt a lot, and cost a lot to fix;

\-found out 2 of my milk teeth (although I'm 19 I still have 4 of those) have practically no root so I'll probably have to replace them in the near future (there goes a whole lot of money too);

\-asked crush out and got rejected;

\-I'll probably move to another apartment;

 \-lots and lots of tests at university;

\-made out with two women at the same time at a party and they proposed a threesome;

\-found these girls on facebook and instagram but was ignored by one of them;

\-have made a decision to pursuit a different degree, and change as soon as application starts (most likely in december I'll applicate for the transfer to electrical engineering bachelor degree);

\-met 3 amazing new friends;

\-went to this amazing roadtrip to the biggest agriculture expo in latin america;

\-cried after a meeting of the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (translation of Secretaria acadêmica?) after being complimented on my work.

So, great things, horrible things, weird things. Right now I'm calm and not as overwhelmed as I was, and sincerely I don't know what to expect. Do I want this insanity to keep going or not?

106,"This is going to be hard to explain mainly because it doesn’t make any sense but I’ll try my best.

Every time I find someone who likes me and am willing to be with, I find myself trying to make myself looks as bad as possible. Usually it happens early on in the relationship, I’ll send messages that are insulting towards this person, I’ll send messages insulting myself making myself look weak and insecure, and if the person stays around I’ll get violent. I’ll pretend to end the relationship (if they don’t do it first) and try and make it look like it’s their fault but then end up going back to them doing the same destructive behaviour. Even if I’m not truly into this person I’ll use them as a source to behave this way. I’ll be terribly mean to them but then end up being nice to them at some point again but the bad behaviour happens again. 

I convince myself that I do it because I don’t want a relationship in fear of getting hurt and can’t find the courage to end it after starting something so I try and make them end it first. Sometimes I tell myself I do these things because I just don’t care. I feel it’s almost like I want to hurt myself by hurting other people this way. 

When this happens with people I think actually have feelings for I regret it badly. If they forgive me I end up doing it again telling myself I don’t care but then when they don’t talk to me I regret it. It’s almost like I even regret it in the moment of doing it but the urge to do these things over powers me. I’ve lost quite a few friends because of this (because most of these people started as friends) 

I really don’t want to act this way and I feel like it has something to do with past abuse but it could just be because I’m naturally a bad person. It seems like this behaviour is only triggered with certain people. When I’m full of regret I tell myself I’ll never act this way again but the urge takes over and causes me to not care about making myself look bad in the moment and also causes me to find excuses as to why I do this. 

And for some reason when I’m over the people I thought I liked I feel like I never really liked them and it was more infatuation than anything else. I don’t really know when I have genuine feelings for someone.",05May2019,1
108,"Had to stand next to a father today and hear him profess to his daughter his opinion on something that was laughably false to anyone who knows better. 

Of course, this opinion was presented to the daughter as if to be fact, and I'm sure the daughter likely takes it to be as such. 

Hooray, another lie takes up residence in the mind of a naive youth left to fester and poison. 

When we're young, we think our parents know everything. Little do we realize that for most of them, their in depth knowledge on topics stop once they leave college/high school and enter the workforce where outside of working, sleeping, keeping up with chores, getting some sparse entertainment time in, spending time with a hopeful mate and then being a parent, their scope of knowledge acquisition hits a roadblock. 

The reality is that they start ""talking out their ass"" on a lot of things. Especially to their children. 

What parent wants to look like an idiot to their kids? I don't think many parents are enthusiastic over the thought of telling their kids they don't know and instead go and google it.

But this is exactly what should happen. Instead, we have ignorant bravado as the cause of such a large source of the spread of misinformation today.

113,"I'm 15, I went through a lot, I was depressed for as long as I could remember, but in this last month it got really bad, I lost joy in everything. I went to a psyciatrist and she told me to just reduce the time I am on my phone, at first I didn't understand, because I was blaming it all on my experiences, I took her advice and for an hour before bed I'd just relax.

Last night, while in bed trying to sleep, I started thinking about why I was so depressed, I thought of what I went through and where I'm at now. Found out that there was nothing bad wrong with me. For the last month I have been reading self-help books, watching help videos.

I liked someone for the first time in my life, but they didn't like me back, it was just rejection. I also had really low self-love and esteam and didn't like myself. But I decided that I'm not perfect and to deal with it, I felt so happy for a couple of seconds, probably the happiest I was for as long as I remember. I woke up this morning, very happy, satisfied with myself. I have overcome my depression, life is good, I'm happy.

(P.S I also learned that the lack of confidence and self love in me was because of what social media and people online thought of as a perfect and Ideal Man. So it was kinda true, I just didn't think of myself as good because I had same mindset as other people.)

(P.S2 I recommend to anyone who is dealing with depression, to just take time and know themselves, accept the disabilites, work on the things you can work on; grades, body, personality. And just stop thinking about the other things; wether someone likes you back, your looks, etc.)

118,"# The raving manifesto of a socially handicapped individual.

*(This was confusing to write because I barely understand my own psychology.)*

&amp;#x200B;

I have been raised to obsessively seek positive feedback from my peers.

The slightest sense of disapproval sends me into rolling torrents of panic because I care about how people perceive me. When being reminded that I am ""weird"" becomes as ubiquitous as breathing, that's certainly a cause for concern, now isn't it?

&amp;#x200B;

Here's why society disgusts me.

* **People have reacted in an extremely sour way to my eccentric, hyperactive behavior.** It has made me pressured to change who I am to fit their image. I want to be an infantile child forever. Why can't everyone else do that, too? Maybe that way, less people would go about their daily lives acting like a thousand roaches crawled up their assholes and died.
* **People express annoyance at my unfamiliarity with elements of popular culture.** I don't care about the latest Grammy awardee or steamy conspiracy unfolding between two celebrities. Stop shoving it into my face and judging me for not knowing what it is, because I don't give two shits of a fuck.
* I am implored to **follow cultural trends** and become **just like everyone else.**
* **Stupid questions are a thing.** Please, for the love of God, just answer my question without making me want to die.
* **People do not readily resolve disputes.** As someone who displays classic signs of high-functioning Autism, I'm simply appalled at how easy it is to inadvertently offend and provoke people, resulting in mindless outbursts of anger and no apparent attempt at communication on their part. Is tranquil negotiation really that difficult for everyone else?
* **I have to bullshit my way through social gatherings** because I don't know how I'm supposed to treat people.
* **I keep saying something wrong** but nobody ever tells me the reasons WHY what I said was inappropriate or hurtful. I am trapped with an enigma on my hands.
* **I don't get the jokes.** Society's inside jokes seem to go over my head, including about 20% of all memes.
* **People cringe at me.** I am judged for petty reasons. All it does is make me disgusted of myself, knowing that I would dare to commit such an atrocity as *going against the grain.*
* **When I don't catch a detail, people tell me that I ""should have been listening"".** It is immediately rage inducing. Coupled with my ADHD, maybe I'm too busy daydreaming about ways I would exact my revenge on the entire classroom to bother catching whatever the teacher had to say about the fundamental theorem of Calculus. Stop reminding me that I will always have the attention span of a goldfish.
* **When I do something divergent, people call me ""weird"".** It is clearly used as a derogatory term. Why does anyone care that my disposition differs from theirs? Why am I berated for it? Why am I punished for my childlike wonder, my eccentricity, my desperately trying to be my own person?
* My dad tells me that I need to **walk** a certain way.
* My dad tells me that I need to **dress** a certain way.
* My dad tells me that I need to **talk** a certain way.
* My dad tells me that I need to **eat** a certain way.
* My dad tells me that I need to **think** a certain way.
* My dad tells me that I need to **address an insult to my name using violence.**
* My dad tells me that I must **never display a sign of weakness.**
* My dad tells me that **I cannot be weird**, or others will judge me.
* My dad tells me that I cannot be a homosexual. (So I'm not.)
* My dad is screaming at me again.

&amp;#x200B;

I fucking despise normality now. **Thanks, Dad.**

I come from a tightly knit community of around 3,000 normies. None of them will understand the anxiety that washes over when it comes my turn to make a move in the perpetual social game of chess. I don't know how to play chess.

What I do know is how to throw the whole *unwritten rule book* out the window and behave with no convoluted restraints tying me down. *I can't do that in the wrong crowd.* The lack of people in my life who do the same thing has left me feeling more than a bit isolated.

Without any solace of any kind.

# Today,

I woke up and I was numb again. I don't remember the last time I've felt something that wasn't superficial, and I thus don't remember the last time I've truly felt connected to another human being in a moral, existential, philosophical manner. I don't remember the last person who could relate to this Hell eternally raging on inside my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I like complete open-mindedness.

I like it when me and a friend can make up our own rules about how to act.

I like interactions with only one or two people at the same time. Any more than that would result in the formation of a social machine with a mind of its own, and that's no-bueno.

I like attention.

I like instant gratification.

I like pleasure.

Sometimes I want to live in Aldous Huxley's interpretation of a dystopian future. I could be promiscuous and it would never hurt anyone.

I am always hungry.

I am weird.

I am lonely.

119,"A while ago I made a friend when my family was on vacation. We learned we only lived about 20 minutes away.  We didn't see each other much until last summer where we hung out every week. I had a lot of fun and she was there for me when my best friend was driving across the country with her family. We tried to keep in contact or at least attempt to hang out during the school year. 

Long story short, I kept reaching out. She could never hang/talk because she was busy. She never reached out. I tried to end it multiple times over facetime. She kept giving me reasons to not end it which were mostly empty promises. My friends just said I should stop reaching out. I didn't listen because I wanted closure.

Yesterday we hung out for the first time since august. We got lunch and went shopping together. The whole time felt different. I tend to make sarcastic jokes with my friends about a couple of shitty things in my life. All about whats been shitty in my life that my friends joke about together. Stuff she used to laugh at or would over facetime. But with each joke it was met with ""Your soooooo funny canileavenow0559"" I hid the fact that I was a little disappointed about it but shes allowed to think my jokes are not funny. 

We got lunch which was ok, then we went to some shops. All a mediocre time. We went to Starbucks where she saw her bullies and immediately left. We hid in a parking lot while she called her friend and told her what happened. That's when it hit me, I can't be there for her. I can't understand what she is going through even though I was in the exact same position as her last year. I don't know her bullies. I got her to laugh and smile for once after it. 10 minutes later I had to leave. We gave each other a big hug, I love you, ""see ya in the summer"" lines and then I left.

 I texted her when I got home to check if she was ok. She just said ""I'm fine and thank you for checking up on me""  Then in that moment I had realised that the hangout that just went on, was all the closure I needed. I don't think she meant for it to be that and I know she still wants to be my friend and thinks we are still friends. But for me, it gave enough to realize she didn't need me. She had her friends who were there for her. And now I can finally let go. 

I unadded her from my private story this morning. I also unfollowed her finsta on my normal Instagram account, the one I usually browse stuff on. Changed her name on Snapchat back to her actual name (I put an inside joke that we have as their name on my Snapchat for all my close friends.)

But despite anything, if she wants to ever talk to me, I will respond. I'm just not going to reach out to her anymore. I'm proud of myself because it's something I never thought I was strong enough to do.

122,For the past couple of months I’ve started to write letters to the daughter I might one day have. It started because I thought in the event that for whatever reason if I dont get to meet her then I want her to be able to read about how much I looked forward to meeting and knowing her. I think I’d be a great father but am prone to not always making the best decisions so in any event I’ve been writing to her about what my life is like and giving her pieces of advice I’m learning and wish someone would of given me. I find that its easier to write to her than to just write about what I did the past weekend or something like that.

124," 

I know in order for my life to keep going at a good pace it’s important for me to focus on my studies, be open to meeting new people, and keeping a healthy diet/fit lifestyle. 

But it takes a toll on me because I’m overly sensitive to live or something. I’ve never been with a man or a woman. &amp; I’m 23. I’ve never been in a relationship. I haven’t had a best friend since high school. I don’t like just about any person I come in contact with- romantically or platonically. I have friends and a lover created in my head because nothing in real life works. And that’s all fine and weird- but I can’t keep being alone. At the same time I’m legit terrified of people. I don’t want to be cheated on, or battered- I have all these paranoid thoughts I can’t dust off for some reason. I’ve begun to see people in general as inherently evil and it’s messing up my life, or at least starting to and I don’t know what to do. 

But I also acknowledge that without people, my life is pretty dull. I wish I knew what it was like to be desired, or loved. At the same time I wish I didn’t feel these things in the first place. I wish I didn’t feel such a need to want friends, a family, or a lover. I hate this feeling. I’m sorry if I confused anyone with my writing. I see couples and other friends laughing and I wish just once it was me. At the same time, I wish I was fine being alone for good. Being in solitude I start to wonder what I’m existing for and I can’t really find much of a response to that.

126,"The first time she told me she wanted to hang out with me, I couldn't sleep, eat or do anything else. I hoped that she liked me but I maintained the idea that she just wanted to be friends. Hoped is an understatement; I thought about her, all the time, every day. When she left the room, I felt empty; when she was there, I felt there was a wall between us. I didn't know how to let her know I liked her. I guess that's why things like art and music exist, they can communicate ideas that words can't. That's exactly what I felt: that even if I told her, it wouldn't do it justice (there's a DFW quote about this somewhere but I'm too lazy to post it). I know that we are very different, but I want to get to know her so bad; I want to know what she's like when she's mad, tired, happy, sad. I tried to act like I was fine with us being friends, like I was fine with taking it cool. The truth is I wanted to jump over the table every time I saw her. I stared thinking she only wanted to be friends but the only reason I kept hanging out with her was to get to know more about her, I'd think of any silly reason to get closer.
