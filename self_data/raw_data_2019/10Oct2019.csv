2,"**This is not me bragging. Quite the opposite**

Unlike other people I can't look at a situation and not analyze it from all angles. For example, people believe that a victim can never be blamed. I don't. If someone sees a sign that says ""Beware Of Dog"" and then jumps the fence, and gets mauled, I consider that their fault. But to everyone else that would be victim blaming. I just don't get why.",10Oct2019,2
3,I have a twin brother. Most days some stranger will come up to us and be like “wow are you guys twins? That is crazy you look the same!” As often as this happens I feel very unseen. We have been called “the twins” our whole life and people talk to us as if we are one person. I feel like I don’t know how to be a individual. We live together but now we are old enough that we have our own jobs. We went to college together. I have been at my job for four years now. This is the first situation I have been on my own in. He is not there at work with me. Im by myself. Which is fine i guess. I get my work done. But socializing is hard. Any friend group I have been apart of has been because people thought it was cool that we were twins. It is a point of interest to people. At work now I don’t have that. I suck at socializing. I feel like I don’t know what to do. I have to learn to socialize without the twin dynamic. It is very hard. I don’t really have many friends besides my brother. I see other people laughing and carrying on at work. I feel very far away from that. I isolate myself. I don’t take interest in other people. I don’t really know how. I know you get back what you put out but sometimes I feel like I don’t have it in me. Idk. I kind of got myself in a mood today. Does anyone else have a twin that is their better half? That would be cool. Do you have trouble being on your own? I know I do.,10Oct2019,1

6,"I’d say my biggest fuckup is trying to remain calm through situations, losing my patience and then saying extremely hurtful shit because it makes me feel so damn good when I’ve been a punching bag for words/tone for the past 30-60 minutes.  

We just had an argument over what towel I used.  I grabbed a new towel out of the closet and went to take a shower.  I left it on the sink and hopped in the shower.  

I shower, get out, my towel is now hanging on a rack next to 2 other towels and two of them are very similarly colored.  Well shit, she moved my towel and now it’s a 50/50 guess.  

I guessed wrong and used her sister’s towel.  Big deal, just use another towel, my bad.  

Nope, I said, “Yeah you moved my towel so I didn’t know which towel to use and was pretty sure that’s the one I grabbed.”  

Sigh...  I was calm then but after her snapping at me constantly I lost it and said, “I really don’t know why I want to marry you sometimes.”

She does have to be at a certain level of attractiveness: at least average, which to me is not a super high bar. I'm attracted to most girls as long as they're not terribly underweight or overweight.

&amp;#x200B;

Meaning an average looking girl who wears shorts for let's say 3/5 of the days I see her, I end up finding her more attractive than a super attractive girl who wears jeans all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout my life, I've come to associate women in shorts with going outside, being athletic, being confident, being carefree, being cheerful, etc, and it just kind of stuck.

# Am I Losing Apart?

Am I losing apart?  
There was a time, when I used to look up in to the sky,   
Thinking, “Sky is the limit!”,  
But now… I find sky to be too far!

Am I losing apart?  
There was a time, when I used to find more sleeping hours as a bane,   
Thinking, “I don’t want to waste my precious time”  
But now… I find sleeping as a boon!

Am I losing apart?  
There was a time, when I used to treat every minute as equally important,  
Thinking, “Time is the most precious entity”  
But now… I’m least bothered about wasting no. of hours!

Am I losing apart?  
There was a time, when reading every word was equally meaningful,  
Thinking, “We live and breathe words”  
But now…. I feel words are quiet, making me blind!

Am I losing apart?  
There was a time, when I used to find conversation as a form of an art,  
Thinking, “Conversation is a mystery. It’s the art of never seeming bored.”  
But now.. I find conversation as a lost form of an art!

Yes, I’m losing apart!  
Going through a phase of destruction (or self-destruction).

This is the time when I wish to look forward to every day as a new beginning,  
Thinking, “Its never too late to be what you might have been.”

21,"Context: got divorced a couple of years ago. Dated a couple of women in the meantime. It was super weird due to me not having recovered emotionally yet, broke both of them off.

For the past almost a year, I haven't seen anyone. I'm actively avoiding it. There have been maybe a couple of opportunities but I kinda just ""played stupid"" and avoided them. I've gotten better emotionally and kinda realised I just don't want that complexity in my life at the moment.

At the same time, I think I might be missing out on life. Should I go on Tinder? I get tired just at the thought of it. I'm currently happy just having a quick wank every week or so. I feel desensitised.

There's just so much pressure around dating. You have to be interesting, you have to sell yourself. I hate that.

Sex also still gives me some serious anxiety. I've basically only slept with one woman for 10 years, and nobody else beforehand. I took up Viagra (which is great BTW) after my divorce because of it.

Anyway, to bring it back to the title, all these things just make me not even want to try. Right now I'm just cruising and hoping that I randomly meet someone who takes me out of my comatose state.

I can't speak on some things, because it's still an on-going legal case. But I had been denied twice for my unemployment benefits, because I quit my job. You can't quit a job, but you can be fired.  I appealed it both times, because I knew I had every right to quit. The way I was treated, ridiculed, embarrassed, belittled, sexually harassed, forced to do work with hazardous materials, etc. was not okay. They refused to do anything about my issues, I begged for change. I didn't want to quit, but I was forced to quit.

Today, after almost 3 months of fighting for my unemployment benefits, 2 denied appeals, and a review hearing later .. I won my case! The review board declared I did have just cause to quit, and now I will receive my unemployement benefits!

I feel like an absolute badass! I have a lawyer for my legal case, but not for my unemployment case. I did all of this on my own, I did the research, I did all the work. The appeal was reversed, because of me!

27,"First off i wanna say im aware of how much of a lesser problem this is compared to other stuff that are on here (bless them all and i hope everyone feels better), So I've been in severe pain lately because of this internet crush i been having I'm a mediocre looking 21 yo guy from a third world country and she's from somewhere in Europe ( sorry about not being specific but in case someone i know sees this) and im not gonna lie she's average looking but i just really like her so i don't give 2 shits about her appearance specially that all this started on discord so i mainly fell for her personality and inner beauty.

This is a long one and im bad at telling stories even tho i tend to do so, therefore im gonna try and summarize this!

So first issue im from a poor country our currency is fucked our economy is fucked and the average wage per day here is around 4$ (yes per day not per hour) when im aware enough that people get paid around 8~15$ an hour outside (before taxes of course) so there's no way in the fuck im gonna see her before im 30 or something. I'm aware of all of that but i still am crushing on her and i can't stop it even i know it's not right! 
 
I still told her that i like her cause I'm confident enough to ! And she took it very well but i have this little issue with ranting.
I hate talking about my problems specially to people that i love cause i only wanna show them the best of me and only the best of me but i still complain to her and look like and idiot and I'm such an book with her and that makes me look absolutely pathetic and i hate myself for it cause I'm very well aware that I'll never get her but instead of maintaining a healthy friendship i keep ruining it by this self-greifing shit i do!

And finally to make it even worse i have a very good friend of mine that also started liking her but he's in a way better position than me and im betting they're gonna meet probably next summer if not before that and he's way better at flirting and he's taking all of her attention now and i couldn't be more jealous worst thing is we talked about it and i honestly love them both enough that i wouldn't mind it but he keeps flirting with her while im around and it hurts me so basically i became the underdog all the sudden. I know she's got a life and she has to meet people and find love and i hope she will but ... Does it have to be like this ?? I don't know how to act or how to feel im in so much pain and I've never had this before i know that i gotta let go but it just hurts so much.

Im sorry if this is dumb or anything i just wanted to share and i hope i didn't bother anyone if possible you could try and leave suggestions in the comments and that's all.",10Oct2019,1

29,"A couple weeks ago I had a dream I was at an outer border of Disneyland. It was a dirt road and people were crossing this dirt road as if they were crossing the US/Mexico border and were getting shot at by security as they ran across. I was afraid to go so I took another route around to get in. Then the dream ends.

A week later I have a dream I'm at the parking lot with my family getting ready to go to Disneyland. I move one of our cars to be closer to the other and somehow my cat is there with us and jumps in the car I get in. Then after I'm done moving the car the dream ends.

After I woke up from Disney dream #2 I'm kind of amuzed by these recent Disneyland dreams. I decide if I have a third dream I *must* go to Disneyland and that there must be a reason I'm having these dreams (lmao).

Then last night, I'm at a table at what seemed like an outdoor eating area at a college and talking to my sister...about having Disneyland dreams and that I need to have one more and then I'm obligated to go. In a dream. And then that shifts to me talking to a co-worker who loves theme parks about the best days to go. I mention that I want to go on a non-peak day, but not a completely empty day because I like a decently packed Disneyland park for the atmosphere and hype from being around so many people enjoying the same thing.

So now I'm planning my days for Disneyland. I'm surprised because while I haven't been there in over seven years, I have been to Disneyland six or seven times in my life and once to Disneyworld. But my memories of Disneyland are distant enough now that I'd love to go again. Like I said about the crowd, one of my *favorite* parts about Disneyland is the atmosphere waiting in line at Indiana Jones. This is the primary reason I don't want the park to be dead when I go, because I'd feel like I'm cheating if I get to zoom through the atmospheric queue lines. But my days off pretty much require that I go Tuesday and Wednesday as I'm planning on 2-day park hopper tickets so I can hit every ride I can and make the best of it. I might end up going each day separate weeks but whatever happens I'm pretty excited that my literal dreams are coming true.",10Oct2019,1

A lot of my time I sit inside playing fortnite in so which I’ve made 2,000$ competitively but that’s nothing and especially in 2 years. I work as a detailer for a limo company and That’s pretty much it. I do have some bad anxiety and social anxiety. A lot of that comes from smoking weed for years prior to playing fortnite. The last year has been hell for me and I really hope it’s just gonna get better. 2 weeks ago I found myself in the ER due to heart pain when breathing. They took a EKG and x-rays and they found nothing wrong. They said my EKG was fine but not perfect. They ended up diagnosing me with costocondritis. Fast forward 2 days I get hit in the chest at the skatepark and my whole chest is hurting so bad and I couldn’t breathe without my whole chest hurting so I went to the ER again. They did the same thing and they said my EKG was perfect so the next day when I had to go to my doctors for my follow up. They were reassured when they heard my 2nd EKG was fine so they didn’t follow up with anything with my heart. So right now it’s been 2 weeks and my heart has been hurting every now and then. It’s like a really fast sharp pain and then I start getting nervous and I think that just makes it worse. I am 6’0’ and weigh 150 pounds.

39,"About 10 years ago my life as I knew it changed. I was set to get married but the person had other ideas and just like that all my plans and everything was flushed down the toiled on the eve of my 30s. I fell into a depression then to rub it in I lost my job. This is right when Minecraft came out. Since I had no job and no wife and nothing else going on I joined the alpha testing and via reddit found one of the earlier Minecraft communities being organized and joined in. It was great at first. They set up this thing called mumble and there were always people around to chat with and the game was engaging and for the first time in years since I had graduated college it felt like there were friends around.

The server blew up. We had thousands of users join in 2010/2011 and the server had to reorganize itself from a loose confederation of interested Minecraft players into a student government of sorts.   At first I wasn't part of the head administrators team but after some internal shuffling I was brought on as one of 5 head administrators. Around this time I was building a small city and near buy another player was making something cool. Dude joined mumble and everything seemed fine. We were around the same age and were both playing the same video game and became friends on the internet. Everything seemed cool.

The community really started to ramp up. We had a pretend war with a ""griefing"" team (something about ice cream lol) that brought a ton of attention to our servers.  This guy helped us moderate the ""attacks"" and roll back the damage and keep the server ticking. I sponsored him into the mod team then he became one of the admins. People started having off-server and off-mumble video chats on some camera site I can't remember the name of. Fine whatever. This but this is also when people started to have interpersonal problems on the server that ended up leveraging the free resources to mediate in the Admin team. It wasn't particularly what I wanted to do but our system seemed to be working and it was still more fun than not.

Then the first ""sob"" story happened. I should have been aware of this as I've dealt with sob story types in my life but my guard was down. This was a video game. People were having fun. But this guy lost all his money and his job too I guess and was getting evicted. We were planning on having a fund raiser event anyway and outside of my control someone decided it would be good to help one of our own in a tough time. We ended up handing this guy well over a thousand dollars. The next week the first pretty shocking event happened that I learned about. Dude met up with a local minor that he met on reddit for crippling alcoholics or something, got wasted then rode a bike out to this persons house and there was an entire embarrassing situation that I mostly blocked out of my head. It ended with this guy bloody on camera being locked out of this kids house or something. Seriously I repressed this incident in my own head. Who knows what really happened. All this presumably paid for by the good intentions and fund raising of my community. 

Fine ok whatever. Things went on mostly as normal. There were a few months of calm but in this time the demographics of the server really changed. All of a sudden there were a large amount of young women joining the server . This is right when the complaints started coming in. Dude made one lady ghost the chats apparently. Another one apparently getting caught up in the moment with other late teens/20 somethings went topless on a video chat and sure enough some 40 something year old man was there and got screen captures of this or something. I can't prove exactly what happened here but something not right. Then the DM screen caps came in.

Great. This guy is creepy af to these kids and I let him in. 

When it became time to ban this guy in the truest form of an alcoholic everything became a conspiracy against them personally who does no wrong. Paragraphs and paragraphs of text were generated. Lines were being drawn in the sand. This was it my fun innocent time playing blocks and getting stoned was coming apart and this fucking guy was trying as hard as he could to tear it down on his way out. I had to write several paragraphs detailing this and explaining the ban the the people who weren't fully clued into the extent of the problem. It was one of the hardest things I ever had to write and post knowing that someone who was an adult had to read this but we needed him out and out of contact with the people who were trusting me and the other people in the server to do what they can to keep them safe. This killed it for me, I became really bitter with the game and with the community drama and over the course of the next month or so ended up winding down my involvement and rejoining real life. The connections I made on the server actually helped me transition my old career into becoming an actual systems administrator. I also met my current wife in 2013 at this time too. I never really talk about how intense the Minecraft thing got even though she knows I still play it on single player mode.

This guys next steps? He set up a child friendly Disney themed minecraft server to lure loads of children. The server became big and he was probably exposed to thousands of potential targets. When you look at his profile online he still participates in really questionable communities making questionable comments. On any fad where you know will be a lot of young people, he is always there around them. Remember that dumb ass Rick and Morty sauce meme?

Time passes (about a year) things that used not to care for me, some urge like wanting to hug her a lot and being easily hurt for any kind of rejection then about 7 months passed we had some personal conflict in those time and still we have been able to work it out. I think i fell in love with her and were planning to tell them that, but what if isn't a good idea even if i trust them i want to keep this relationship as it is, but no letting this out i think is going to hurt me.

50,"Last November I was home for Thanksgiving and met a guy on Tinder. Had our first date on a Friday. The next day I invited him to hangout with a friend and I. That night we ended up at a bar and all crashed at my mom's place. Somehow he ended up staying with me for the rest of the week. The wednesday before thanksiving he woke up with a sore throat and by the next day he had a temp of 104. He refused to go to the hospital that night. On thanksgiving he returned home still very ill. I left the next day for a 13 week contract in Hawaii. I started work that following Monday and woke up to a text from him asking me why his temp dropped from 103 to 96.4. I called him immediately and told him to go straight to the ER, he was septic and could die. The next day his mother calls me and informs me that he was admitted into the ICU and was in multiple organ failure. Dumb me got on a plane that week and flew back to Indiana and watched them put him on life support and stayed with his mother for a week before returning to Hawaii. Once I returned to hawaii I cancelled my contract and moved back to Indiana. I spent 2 weeks with him in the hospital and the day he d/c home he basically told me to fuck off and he never wanted to see me again. 

I'm one fucked up person. Who quits a job in hawaii to move back home for a guy she only knew for 2 weeks that she met on tinder?! I've started seeing a therapist because I realized that a normal person wouldn't have done what I did. But I can't seem to talk about it with my therapist for god knows how many reasons.

51,"just some background.

i’ve been at college for two months now, and i’ve felt like i really haven’t found my best friend and it makes me sad because i feel like everyone around me has their one person. there’s one girl i connect with a lot, and i would say she’s my closest friend right now. i don’t want to jinx anything but if i had to pick a best friend it would be her for sure, right now.

my RA and i became really good friends. i thought he was a really nice guy and cool and i wouldn’t hate him as my RA for the year. long story short, one of my friends started to get feelings for him and it kind of become an annoying thing. all i heard from her was our RA, our RA, our RA. my roommate and her got really close and i don’t even really like my roommate, and i really started to not like her when we would all hang out (roommate, friend, and RA) and i felt like her true colors would show especially regarding me. i slowly distanced myself and put more time into other friendships.

RA got sad and told me he felt like i was avoiding him and that he just hasn’t seen me in awhile. i guess i had distanced myself a little too fast but, i didn’t like being around any of them and i dont owe them my time if i don’t want to spend time with them. 

we haven’t really talked in awhile and he saw me today and we caught up. he said the whole, haven’t seen you in awhile and i said i know and he went “yeah because you never come out of your room” and this is a sensitive spot for me, all throughout high school i had really bad social anxiety and not a lot of friends and remained in my room for a long time. i told myself college was going to be better and i’ve been trying so hard socially and putting time into friendships and hanging out with people whenever i can. my parents and whole family for that matter also made/make fun of me for being in my room all the time, at my own house. 

so that made me feel like fucking trash. he asked where i had been and i said a lot of the the time, the gym. i also added that it was my alone time. and he went “alone time? all you ever have is alone time.” which just is not true because my roommate is in the room a lot. so i just corrected myself and said it was “me time.”

eventually he told me that as an RA they had to fill out a form to see how they know the students and one of them was “students that are struggling academically” and he wrote me down and how i’m failing remedial math and told me he laughed and was like “how is she failing math 95?” nobody gets how bad i am at math besides my mom. i can’t comprehend math past 3rd-4th grade. it’s really difficult for me and is practically like a foreign language. being bad at math is a sensitive spot for me too, because i feel like i get made fun of for it or i have in the past and the subject alone makes me feel dumb. 

and he also just told me flat out he doesn’t like my perfume. which isn’t a big deal. but it was unnecessary.

after all that, he asked me to fucking hang out too. i don’t know why but that made me feel so shitty.",10Oct2019,1

56,"There is a lot of context in this story, so let me begin:  
I'm 25\[M\], I've put up a startup with two partners, I really enjoy my job, it's something that we created, it's our creature and we are working hard for it. But being my own boss, I can have flexible worktime and work from remote.  
I'm a musician too (it will come together, I promise), I have two active bands, not impossible to manage, but we have some gigs and they usually come in the weekend. Music is something that I love, I would never ever consider to stop.

  
I've been with this girl for a year now, I love her and care for her, but we live in different cities and usually we pass the weekends together.  
It started like a sporadical thing, being flexible at work I managed to stay at her place on Mondays and Tuesdays, just to pass more time with her, but now she gets angry and sad if I don't manage to stay every week at least one workday at her place. And I started taking fewer gigs on the weekends, couple a month maximum. But with time my GF started to ask for more. She's afraid that if I spend time on my passions, she will always come second, and says that, being my work hours flexible, I should spend most of my days at her place. And yeah, I'd love to do that but for now this is not entirely possible, just because my workplace is 1h30 by car from her place, at best, and reducing my gigs would mean to stop playing with bands, or to play at all.

Each time we discuss this, she goes onto the passive-aggressive, saying things like ""I'm not asking you to quit playing, It's just a matter of priority"", and ""I'm not asking you to quit your job and find another one here, but being your business you can do it everywhere"". But pushing forward would mean quit my passion and losing my partners' trust in me, and I don't want that.

She is a very anxious person, she's afraid of losing me, I've come to the point to weight each word and be careful on what to post on social media in order not to upset her. I'm afraid to invite her to my gigs, or event to talk about rehearsal, to be honest. And talking about this would turn into a discussion.  
I think I'm a balanced person, I can take the toll of a fight or even a breakup, but I'm really afraid of what she would go through after. This doesn't mean that I don't care about our relationship, but if things won't work out I'll find my path nonetheless.

I really don't know what to do, if I satisfy her needs I'm afraid I will lose the trust of my partners and my bandmates, if I tackle the problem directly with her I'm afraid she will make a decision that will hurt her a lot.  
I really feel checkmated, any thoughts reddit strangers?

If you want to be the most effective, visionary, inspirational, productive person (and to be the best in any of the roles you ‘play’ in your life), it’s useful to become conscious about why you do what you do in the different roles you have; to be aware of the habits you operate from and to recognise your attitudes, values, judgements and assumptions you have toward yourself and the relationships you are a part of.

It is in the gap between what you currently do; and the vision you hold of the most brilliant version of yourself as a person; that you can make growth based choices to expand your magnificence.

To know who and why you choose to be the person you are right now, you will need to get up close and personal with your brain as it is the most magnificent thing you will ever own, and you do own it!

You can be in control of it every conscious moment, with the aid of a few simple tips.

### Why am I a creature of habit?

To start with, let’s talk about why you are at times a creature of habit.

Basically, as humans, we allow our brains to adopt some efficient strategies for taking shortcuts when drawing conclusions about what events, experiences, interactions, and relationships with different people in our lives mean.

Ever noticed how in your adult life you do so many tasks and respond and react to people in your life in set ways?

For example you drive, eat, get dressed, shower, answer phone calls, and talk to your team/peers/colleagues/partner/parents/kids in an automatic way.

You will lead a certain way.

Also notice how once you have had an interaction or two with an individual you have ‘summed them up’, made your opinion up about them, and you bring that opinion into future interactions or life decisions.

### Creating mental shortcuts

You create shortcuts at the brain level to save mental energy —your brain is hardwired for laziness based on your survival instinct. Bottom line, your brain wants you to create habits, automatic responses and repetitious behaviours so you can have as much energy available at any moment in time in case you need to run for your life (flight) or fight for your life (fight).

Lucky for us in civilised countries, we don’t have a lot of threats to our life on a daily basis.

What does this mean? You can take control back of our brain.

In all aspects of life you can think fresh in every moment.

You can be much more creative and respond to current information available to you in the moment.

You can make your mind up about something or someone based on what is ‘real data’ in this very moment; instead of letting your past views, impressions, decisions and habits guide your behaviour.

### How do I rewire my brain?

Through *self-directed Neuroplasticity*, where *you* make in-the-moment choices to re-wire the neural pathways in your brain.

Neuroplasticity is the brain’s life-long ability to change based on new learning and new ways of thinking; and you are in charge.

All you need to do to *choose what you want to focus on and then pay attention to it repetitively*.

When you were a child you learnt new skills (such as walking, using cutlery, putting puzzles together, cleaning your teeth) through repetition. This is no different.

If you want to become the most effective and fantastic person you can be, choose what characteristics, traits, attitudes, communication styles, you admire and put your energy into giving them a ‘pulse’.

Breathe life into these things through your focused attention on being the way you want, through your intentions, thoughts, feelings, words, and actions.

Let’s be clear on one thing. You’ll have thousands of awesome habits and patterns and repetitious behaviours that lead to awesome outcomes in all areas of your life. Keep them; allow your brain to repeat those ones when appropriate.

What I am suggesting is to be in the moment, every moment and make fresh choices that will lead to the best result for you and anyone else you are interacting with or influencing; be it your team members, colleagues, peers or with the precious people in your personal life.

If your old habits lead to mediocre results, choose a different thought, emotional response, behaviour or words that will create the potential for great outcomes for all. Do this repetitively and your will rewire your brain.

### How do I create new habits in situations where I am not creating the best results?

There are 3 easy steps!

1. Pause, you need to do this to be able to be in the moment.

When you *pause* to consciously consider what high quality outcomes you desire for any relationship or other area of your life, it enables you to alter any habitual behaviour, like procrastination or lack mentality such as ‘I don’t know how to communicate effectively?’ or ‘I don’t have enough time to deal with the demands in my life’ and you will create better results.

So basically, when you *pause*, you will create the space to catch yourself in old thought patterns, habits and beliefs that may not be generating successful life outcomes.

Only then you are in a position to change the way you go about being the best version of yourself, moment by moment.

 2. Set a clear Intention/s.

Setting intentions are simple…… state what you want.

So, let’s say you need to have an honest discussion with your partner of a family member, and you have found it challenging in the past.  You need to set a clear intention for the outcome you now desire. For example you may intend to *have a respectful conversation with the person, where you transparently discuss the issues together and reach an agreeable outcome*.

Notice how the intention is CLEAR and SPECIFIC: respectful conversation, transparently discuss relationship issues; reach an agreeable outcome.

Okay, so you have *paused*, *set your intention* and asked lots of rich questions to stimulate healthy leadership behaviour, now all that remains is to:

 3. Take action. Think thoughts, speak words and choose behaviours that will lead to getting awesome results. The great thing here is you have unlimited possibilities available to you. This where you pay attention to your choice through action.

When creating news ways of being, *you need to be consistent*.

Remember, your brain needs *repetition* to strengthen the neural pathways of your new, more effective choices.

62,"To preface;

This story does *not* take place in any English speaking countries, as obvious as it may be.

I was young and dumb.

This story will be 100% truth, I will be telling you about my wrongdoings.

I had lived in the US for a decade or so, so I liked to think English was my first language - seeing as the only schools I went to were American. I'd been an A+  student, achieving incredibly academic heights i.e reading as early as 4 years old, acing every test, having been the student who'd read the most in a month on average, never having to study even on finals. That'll get you a good feel on the downgrade.

Skip to moving to the Middle East on short notice immediately after 4th grade.  I was devastated,  going from the best to the worst. I couldn't read nor write Arabic, and what little I spoke was street Arabic, which they did not speak at school. I was so miserable about my situation that despite being only 11, (Trigger warning-)   I'd  attempted suicide whilst not knowing what it was on a difficult night of studying  by squirting a sizable portion of hand-sanitizer into my mouth until my head pounded.  I felt like a moron.

Of course, with my feelings working that way, I'd befriend an English-speaker who was a year older than me, who we'll call H. She was kind enough at the time, but was obsessed with growing up.  Though the friendship didn't last long, seeing as 7th grade was in a different building than 1st-6th grade. She left and I became friends with girls who wouldn't judge me- though I still felt like a chore rather than a friend. 

Fast forward- 7th grade. H was in 8th grade. We met once more and spoke every now and then, but we weren't as tightly knitted as before. It was around this time I befriended another fluent English-speaker who we'll call B for privacy's sake. I am still friends with B. One day whilst walking with H, she started asking me *VERY* personal questions that I felt incredibly uncomfortable answering. Questions of my body and my home life. Bad stuff.

I knew at this moment I didn't want  to be friends with H anymore, if she was going to rush me into these things when I obviously made my dislike to these questions known. At first I simply ignored her, declined her invitations to join her during lunch and such. Then it went to avoiding. 

She wouldn't get the hint, and would walk after me. I'd quicken my pace, she'd do the same. It'd gotten to the point where I was full on running in the jam-packed hallway with her chasing after me. She'd give B and my other friends death glares. I was absolutely done with her. I told B that we'd walk together for safety, and that I despised H now. Now, here is where I went horribly wrong and what might have decidedly started this whole mess, and I sincerely regret it.

Every time we'd pass her, whether it'd be outside or in the halls, B and I would quietly go ""Ew."". Each time it got louder, but once it got to speaking levels, I started to feel uncomfortable with our week-long ""Ews"", and told B to stop. The last time she did it was whilst yelling. Now H had a large group of friends, who started to do the same- except this time it went on for *months.* At least I had the decency to stop it after a week. To make this really long story short, H started infiltrating my friend group, despite her being a whole year older than us and her own class on the other side of the school. Every time I made a new friend, she'd be their friend as well. Every time I was outside, she would be too. Once I went inside, she followed. It was *incredibly* noticeable.

At some point, she stole my sketchbook and returned it later in the day without my knowing. She was everywhere I was, in every friend group I was in. She'd mutter curse words and insults every time she passed me while I was alone, and I'd routinely catch her glaring at me. She legitimately scared me, and I thought she'd kill me. She manipulated everyone I knew to think that she was genuinely interested in them, but she only wanted to be closer to me. Why else would an 8th grader want to hang around a niche group of 7th graders?

Final's week, second term. How this works is that we come in at 9 am, take the hour long test, then the buses arrive at 12. lots of time outside. H was always waiting outside my test room for B, who was also at this point manipulated to like her. She ignored my warnings. 

Last day of finals week. B and I were walking together and talking about regular teen things- crushes and such. Nothing abnormal. See, but H's older sister, who we'll call M, was walking with B's 9th grade friend. Yes, H's 9th sister was about to assault a 7th grader. 

B and I were circling around outside, going counterclockwise, whilst M and her friend were doing the same, except clockwise. Each time we passed, they'd get closer and closer until they were explicitly brushing shoulders with us, each time mocking what they heard the last round. I was genuinely confused- I wasn't even talking about anything too wrong, only my crush at the time. Our fourth or so round, M stormed at us and shoved as apart before walking around, whipped around and screamed at us with such ferocity that I was unsure she was even speaking to us. She said: ""If you want to talk about me, say it to my face!"" This was not the assault.

Now B and I were utterly bewildered and continued with our circling. M was waiting straight ahead, so we steered off and tried ignoring us, but she cornered us. She was glaring at me with two girls at her side who looked like they'd come straight out of a teen drama. The big one and her two bodyguard-like minions. She repeated herself. "" If you want to speak about me, say it to my face."" I calm responded, ""We weren't talking about you."" She puffed up her chest, I guess a sign of intimidation? and this girl who was two heads taller than me shoved herself onto me. She screamed that I was a liar, and me being a scared little 12 year old looked at B for confirmation, which she gave. I told M to get out of my face, and turned to walk away. M Grabbed my ponytail and *ripped me back,* and her two friends ***joined*** her. Three girls pulling at my ponytail and whacking at my head, and I tried to be cool by pulling myself back up and speed-walking away. I expected B to be with me, but she wasn't. She was still with the group. 

By the time I found her again, she was crying and refusing to talk to me. To this day, I have no idea what they told her to make her cry. Almost tauntingly, The group came up to mock us and kiss each other in front of two frazzled 7th graders. H, (bet you weren't expecting her,) told everyone we *were* speaking about them, which I swear on my life we weren't. By the time we left, we had people spitting on our backs. By the next year, they'd switched schools, thank god.

We don't even speak of her anymore.",10Oct2019,1

71,"**TL;DR: I happen to pick wrong choices of words when talking to people, like my friend (25F) in the story, and unintentionally say offensive statements when I want to help them or get to the good side of them. I need help on how to socialize better or at least avoid hurting friends.**

I (25F) happened to offend a friend (25F, I consider close because I'm extremely comfortable with her; *grade school classmate but we became close in 2016 but we talked in between the years randomly***)** twice now because of the statements I have said.

I think I said these things because I wanted to get on to the good side (or so I thought) as if a teacher's pet? I think I tend to try to be someone's preference instead of being myself. And I don't know why or when it started. I don't even know who I really am right now, what's my real personality.

The first time was months ago, she was complaining about how the people from the company she was applying for wasn't really what she expected. She felt like she was insulted and looked down upon even if she knows herself that she had the skills for the role she was applying. She didn't like how they eyed her and she was ranting how she just feels she didn't do anything wrong and how she wanted to retract her resume when they said they'll just contact her. I replied with (translated)

&gt;""I feel like you were irritated then hahaha""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Hahaha they're checking the attitude there""

She immediately replied saying she was good and humble unlike before (I remember her saying to me that she was kind of too confident and proud on her interview where she was then asked a follow-up question and she was left speechless). She clarified that she was told that her experience in the previous job was not related to the role and that she was eyed menacingly which she didn't like. And in a sarcastic way she said I was supportive and remarked ""no wonder why I never chat to this group chat"" and then she left the group.

It wasn't supposed to be done yet, my internet was slow then. She was supposed to read the following statements:

&gt;""You were like that last time while being interviewed, you're just nervous""

I was conflicted that time because I was under pressure from my undergraduate manuscript deadline to be able to graduate after being delayed for 4 more years. I didn't tell her this though, I said I'm sorry  I was busy and didn't give proper attention (in a private message because I couldn't call her). I explained what I wanted to say and asked if we can still be friends and if she doesn't want to anymore, I'd understand. I don't have a lot of friends.

We eventually got it together. I was grateful that she explained to me what I did wrong because my past ""friends"" just left me hanging and didn't talk to me anymore. Earlier, we were talking and she was complaining about a different company that she applied for (she's already hired and in the process before her 1st day). She was ranting about how the company ghosted her and she felt bad because she felt that it was her best interview so far. And now they called her and asked if she's still available. She said her ego was hurt when she was told they'll be processing until weeks later she got hired in a different company and she didn't hear a thing from the company. Saying it's their fault for not contacting her sooner.

I said that ""*it's true, it's their fault. And if they're like that now, what more if you're hired (a close-minded comment, I know)*.""

 I also applauded her that she knows her worth etc. then I replied to one statement saying ""*yeah, they might throw you out soon if they're not sure of your value* (since I personally didn't like the company's ghosting thing, although she could've followed up but idk either if she did or not). I said sorry immediately for the phrase ""throw away"" because in our language it sounded like garbage being thrown out but I didn't know how to phrase it well. She laughed from the term ""throw away"" and then said she didn't like it. She accepted my apology but remarked it's one of the reasons she doesn't like talking to me for too long.

I apologized again, properly. Recognized my faults for being close-minded and for my choice of words. I also asked what can I do to make it up to her and I'll be working on it. She said she's not in the mood for thinking how I can make it up to her.

She explained that she didn't like my choice of words and how I negatively commented about the company she wanted to apply for. Because she still liked the company and what if she still wanted to work there because she liked the role and the fact that her ego was brushed because they called.  She also didn't like how I turned down the company she liked just because they called late and she was already hired by another company.

73,"I grew up in the country. Bonfires and horses, barefooted by the creek, cows and chickens, the whole shebang. There weren't enough people where I lived to open a school so we were bused into the city for elementary school. 

I befriended this black kid named Derick. Derick and I talked on the phone every night.  Eventually, my mom would pick him up to have sleep overs. We were so excited every year when we got our class schedules and ended up with the same teacher. From k-4 we were brothers, always hanging out or on the phone.

In the summer before 5th grade, he and I went to separate summer camps and didn't talk that much. When the first day of school came, I was excited to catch up with my best friend but he wasn't the same. He was hanging out with these two other boys, both black. He'd ignore me and then laugh about it with his new friends. It hurt my heart. I cried and they all 3 made fun of me. I was confused. I asked one of the other friends in our group and they said it's because he's black and they're not supposed to hang out with white people. I never even thought of our race before that moment.

Middle School comes and within the first month, any black friends I had left had ditched me for other black friends. Then cracker day is introduced to me in the form of a sucker punch, while I'm walking down the hallway, followed by getting stomped on. Confused, I asked one of the 7th graders on my bus. I said, ""I didn't even know those kids, why'd they do that""?
"" It's cracker day. You get jumped on cracker day. All of us do. I recommend bringing a lock with you to hold while you're walking between classes. Also, stick with your own kind of you want protection. They don't jump groups of us, only individuals.""
That's when real racism set in. It was us vs them and we were outnumbered. 26 white kids and 400+ black kids. I learned a new language from the white kids on my bus. I'd shout things I didn't even know what they meant. ""Fucking coons, porch monkeys"" such silliness. But as a middle schooler, my entire life is middle school and that's what I thought life was like, us vs them. Every day was a new fear, ""will I get jumped? Will I end up in the hospital like my friend? Will I be forced to defend myself and then get in trouble for fighting? ""

Highschool came and it was a lot more relaxed. Black and White kids still kept their distance but weren't as aggressive. No more yelling racial slurs though I was still called cracker or white boy throughout highschool. I met this girl Chasity in 9th grade and had a huge crush on her. I even joined a few electives just to be in her class. We hung out a lot and did a lot of after school activities together. It was best when we were alone. She was sweet when we were together. As soon as there were other kids though, she'd speak different,be more aggressive, and act completely different. She had to have liked me too, looking back on it. When junior year came, I got my license and bought a car. I'd wake up extra early to pick her up from her house and take her to school and then take her home afterwards. She'd always warn me, ""be careful out here, the only reason you ain't getting shot is you got a sista in the car with you. Now turn that country music down before they hear it"". I always listen to country. I'd always laugh it off like she was playing tough but it is a legit bad area I wouldn't get caught in now even as a 30 something adult.

I worked up the courage near the end of junior year and asked Chasity to the junior prom. It was after school and we were at a Sonic we always went to before I dropped her off. She just said no and asked to be taken home. That hurt. I was sure the only reason we weren't dating was because I was too much of a sissy to ask her.

She rode to school in silence the next morning and as soon as I out the car in park, she tossed a note into my lap and left the car.

She said she couldn't date a white person. She liked me and I was really sweet but her family would not allow it and she'd get made fun of.

That was the last straw. It hurt too much. Black people are weird. I'm just going to stick with my own, like those kids on the bus in middle school suggested. 

Even in my early to mid 20s, I was nice to black people but fuck if I try to be friends or get close to one.

Now, in my 30s, I'm called racist. Pisses me off. I have black friends that I love to death now that we're all older and more mature but the exclusiveness of their American culture is annoying.

As a white country boy, that's my story. Call me what you want but racism is a two way street and I can't tell you how many people I went to school with that never grew out of their experiences. 

Black people, you gotta change too. I understand there's still issues out there. But just because I listen to country and wear boots doesn't mean I hate you or think I'm better than you. If I seem stand offish, it's because I've had a lot more experiences than posted above that I guard myself against.",10Oct2019,1

I have meniere's so i get extremely bad dizzy spells. i opted to have my vestibular system in both ears removed, but since the referral for surgery i accidentally came across a news article on SIDs saying how you need vestibular hair cells to be able to breathe during sleep. the scientist's name was Reubens and he said the hair cells in your vestibular part of the ear detect CO2 and tell your body to breathe and if both vestibulars in the ear are damaged, there will be no or very little response to CO2, and he said people with damaged vestibular hair cells could stop breathing in their sleep. this worried me a lot. the study was done on mice but a review said the experiment also damaged the mice's brains so i am unsure if it was damage to the brains causing the results of the study or chemical removal of their vestibular system.

a follow up paper said mice with damaged ears lost 60% of their respiratory drive to CO2, meaning 60% of the cells responsible for telling the body to breathe were gone.

They're all very nice and we say the usual small talk when we see each other (And I'll admit it's slightly intimidating trying to talk to them because they're all so much more ahead in their fields than I am because I'm just starting out). One of my coworkers has been working here for a few years and regularly gets invited out with the other workers from different companies and I wish I would be invited sometimes. I just don’t think I’m that likeable, but I don’t know why. 

It's lonely being in a new city with new people and I'm not trying to complain, I definitely contribute to the issue here - I'm constantly worried about what people think of me here and how I look (I'm in a very cut throat industry where those things matter) and my energy is just always off.

They can do ALL this shit(hell,they can wreck the global economy SINGLE-HANDEDLY...blowing the fuck outta South Korea,Japan and MAYBE China will do that...and then it's game over,but I digress)..and people STILL underestimate them is fucking crazy...shit.

89,"  

Jesus fuckin Christ! I did it! My heart is racing. the anxiety isn't stopping. New music kinda distracts the mind so it's kinda OK now (as I type this). 

OK, maybe a little background to when I go back to read this again. Today is the 10th of October, 2019. It's a Thursday.  I spent the last 3 days at home all day unable to get out. Well, unable might not be the right word. I could physically get out. I wasn't literally chained to something in my room, no. I was just extremely anxious. I got out of the room to heat food, cook and go to the loo. I spent the whole day gaming or watching something to keep myself from thinking of the crippling anxiety and in the process make it worse. Even as I type it, I am fascinated by how calm I can get when I am doing something. The moment I stop I can feel my heart racing again. Like I want to throw up.

But it's not like I wasn't trying, no. I planned to get out every day. It just took me three fuckin days to finally do it. Thoughts that came to mind when I tried to go ahead with it: ""What's the point? It's almost 3pm. How long can I stay out? Also, I am broke. I will probably get to sit in a cafe till 6pm, when they close. Cafes that stay open after 6pm are like these cafe+mini fancy pub-ish places. I would sooo look like an idiot of a nerd if I sit there by myself with my book, pen and laptop trying to write/type something. Also, what an incredibly lonely, troubled idiot have I become! Maybe I'm so deep in this shit that it actually seems obvious to anyone if they took one good look at me. I might be the laughing stock of the place. The joke of the year"". Funny thing is that I know people have their own personal lives. Hell, I don't see myself remembering everyone I see if I went to a cafe or the library. I'm sure everyone is just as busy with their life. Yet, this feeling of being judged doesn't seem to leave me alone. So, I stayed in all day and tried not to think about it while I played a lot of borderlands 2, watched movies that are either creative or use some well thought of concepts (even if the actual plot kinda sucked) or spent way too much time of YouTube. 

So, what was different today? How did I get out? Why the sudden need to write a journal? Multiple reasons for that, really. I want to try to understand my own anxiety in an attempt to maybe help myself. I am too poor to afford a therapist right now. Maybe I will go to one when I start earning. It was really helpful when I was seeing Glen. Sadly, as a student, I am only limited to 5 free sessions. Luckily, the suicidal thoughts are almost gone. I don't think about it at all these days, compared to about a year back when I woke up every day thinking I was worthless and was designing so many ways to kill myself. I am going to fight this. I know I am smart and have been getting mentally stronger. A strategy I vaguely came up with for myself was to try and start my day early. That way, I don't have to think of how spending just a few hours outside would be pointless. I tried this yesterday but I still ended up staying up really late and then waking up to make my first meal at noon and then that whole cycle of ""it's pointless to go out"" continued. Today, I actually did push myself out of bed at 9am! I did watch a movie but sometimes I just get this courage to take that final step and do things. It's like ripping off a band-aid. Just pull it off really quick. The pain won’t last long and you've done something that you were scared of. 

So, I took that plunge. Got dressed and left. Picked a cafe and here I am writing about it. I just needed that courage from within to push me out. How do you get it? Something that I noticed about myself is that the more time I spend planning it and thinking of doing it, the lesser are my chances to actually do it. I watched the movie today while I worked out and got dressed. After the movie was done, I packed my stuff and got out. Anxiety hit me like a fuckin truck while I sat there in the bus but after I ordered my coffee and sat down to start writing, I feel calmer. ""Clearer in the head"" — As I like to call it. 

For people who don't understand how hard this is and judge people who go through really bad mental episodes, I want to come up with an analogy that I could compare it with. The problem is that you are going against your own mind, the same mind that controls your actions, your physical self and everything you are. There is also this conscious self within you (or within me. Something I came up with in an attempt to better understand and explain my situation to myself and the therapist I went to. The whole mental image concept that I have is something I can write a lot about. Maybe a post for another time) You see what the mind is doing but can’t really do much about it cause the mind controls almost all of you. It's almost like a David vs Goliath situation. ""But come on brah, just make up your mind and fuckin do it! How hard can it be to make up your mind?"" Well, Chad, let me explain it to you. Remember that scene from the first ""Saw"" movie where the two dudes wake up in a room and find themselves chained to the pipe? Well, you know how I said your mind controls your physical self? That mind of yours is like the people in the movie. It's chained and it's panicking wondering how it got chained, what does it do now and how does it get out? Nothing makes sense. It does see the saw in front of it, like in the movie. The thought of cutting off a limb to break free of the chain is possible but is frightening and there is no way it's going to go for that. However, like the end of the movie (SPOILERS! Skip to the next paragraph if you haven't watched the movie and are planning to do so in the near future), the solution to this is to do that thing that scares you. Chop off your leg, it’s going to get messy and it's going to hurt (mentally. I am still shaking) but it does make you feel slightly better. Rip off that band-aid (or going with the SAW analogy, chop that limb off).

I am not going back to read that last analogy again. I think I might laugh at myself and delete it all but the point of writing this is to get it all out. 

Anyway, I have huge respect for those fighting back their depression. It took me years to get to where I am and I am still nowhere. Get therapy if you can afford it. I know I will when I start earning. For those you can’t, be it cause it's expensive or you're from a country where mental health is never taken seriously (I am from one, so I know how you can barely find anyone to talk about it with), hang on tight and don't give up! If you ever find this post, just write to me. Something I really want to do is to help people going through this, whatever the ""this"" might be for them. Unlike most diseases, the one thing that makes mental health problems frightening is that they are all unique to the people going through them. There isn’t a ""general"" diagnosis or remedy for this. It does take a while to get over it or you may never even get over it but knowing there is someone out there to listen to you and connect with what you have to say can instill some courage in you to keep fighting against it. Letting it all out can help momentarily and if like me you're lonely, then write about it. Be brave folks! We can do this and even win! Everything might seem pointless but depression is a mean son of a bitch and I know I do not want to let it win.

I have lost count of how many times I have tried to keep a journal to let it all out. If I kept a book, I get too conscious of my handwriting, the ink colour, the size of the book etc. Word takes a while to open on this laptop. This site seems pretty. The font seems nice. It's simple. Can I keep this up? I hope. Hope it doesn't go like the quantum mechanics online course I took up. The momentum just died down with this sudden anxiety induced mood of mine (I will finish it. Quantum entanglement is fuckin fascinating). I need to start with routines again in hopes of keeping me occupied. It did help me in the past and I kinda need some help with this right now. I'm not giving up. I will be here tomorrow to write another post. This is just my way to get better.",10Oct2019,3

92,"I often (2-3 times a week) get the urge to cut myself but I've never gone through with it for a number of reasons. Mostly because I didn't think I could handle the pain. Yesterday I was feeling shitty and decided to go through with it just to see how much it hurt. I did 8-10 cuts and they were all really tiny (less than 3 mm) and the first few didn't even draw blood. But It felt really good. I had a bunch of other self destructive tendencies that I used to use instead of cutting but I didn't really use them that often because I knew that they didn't really make me feel better. But cutting was very different. It made me feel a lot better.  
  
So my question is, am I overreacting or is it actually a big deal. I feel like the cuts being tiny makes it seem inconsequential but all the other aspects seem serious.  
  
Also, should I tell the person I normally confide in about this? I wanted to tell them but I didn't want to make a big deal out of nothing and I also felt like this was a bit past the friend line and more of a tell a therapist kind of thing.

94,"when i was a kid, a guru used to tell us stories on how to life. a lot of his stories seemed ridiculous from the standpoint of feminism and development in general, but a lot of them were also very wise if you understood them. here goes one of them:

once upon a time, a little girl had an immense problem of waking up early. mechanical alarms failed. people alarms failed. body clocks failed. she asked around for ideas which failed as well. She managed to sleep through everything. one day, someone told her that she could ask her pillow, just before sleeping, to wake her up. she thought it was ridiculous but in the wake of having exhausted all options, she was left with nothing but this idea to try. so one night, right before sleeping, she asked her pillow to wake her up at exactly 6 AM. guess what! it worked. she was up by exactly 5.55AM. 

""it doesnt make sense!"" she thought. so she tried it again. it worked again. and again, and again. she asked her friends to try and it worked on them as well!

so this story made me think really hard about how this happened? how doesit works when we are talking to a pillow? it totally sounds stupid, right? no. it makes sense. 

the reality is that nothing, and no one is closer to your heart than a pillow. when you rest your head on your pillow, when you sleep, when you take a nap, when you are happy, when you are angry, when you cry in it, and even when you do nothing, your pillow is witnessing it. your pillow knows you better than anyone else. your pillow knows your thoughts like no one ever has! and guess what, it doesnt just sit and absorb everything. it is not one sided. your pillow communnicates with you. it exudes its energy in you. you can give it all your thoughts both good and bad, and it will help you rest, think, and freshen up your mind in due time. it's the real agony aunt. it is an endless reservoir of calmness, restfulness, and even positivity which it transfers to you once you rest youself on it. When you ask it to wake you up, it listens and oblidges. your pillow is your best friend and it is calling you right now, to slow down, stop, think, rest, and then start again, blessed for a new day.",10Oct2019,5

96,Ok so I have this friend who i have known since elementary school. We use to hang out all the time and would often smoke weed and talk staying up to like 4/5 in the morning often. Since he started smoking he has shown signs of developing schizophrenia. He began doing some pretty strange things like he put his car in neutral and pushed it off a cliff spot we would often go to and smoke. eventually he moved back in with his parents and stopped smoking. it looked like he was beginning to return back to his old self. I fell out of contact with him for awhile since he often changed phones and would only use a flip phone. Then randomly one night while i was out of the house at work and tried to come visit me. my parents were home and told him to come back later. I had no way of contacting him when i got back so I went on with my plans to go to a friends. Then at around 1AM he came back to my house while I was still out with friends. he began ringing the doorbell over and over again. My parents called the cops of course and they took him back to his parents house. Since then I went to smoke with him one time with my sister. It was just an all around odd vibe from him. he would often mutter out in-cohesive sentences. Hes tried texting me to hang out again but I just dont think I want to be around him. Its really sad to see how he is now and i dont know what to do. I think his parents are getting him help but I cant know for sure.

102,"Why do people trust people? That's choosing to give another person a tool to backstab you. If I put everyone on a trust scale, nobody in this world ranks above a 5 out of 10, and that's only because I have to depend on other people to do their part in team projects and other mundane things. If I put everyone of a scale of how much they really know about me, nobody in this world ranks above a 3 out of 10. 

The last time that anyone had high numbers on those two scales was when I was a stupid naive kid. And every single person I thought I could trust abandoned me. If every bad judgement in trust costs me 10+ years of my life and a gamble with death, that's not a judgement call I'm willing to make again. And that's assuming the previous incident has been entirely resolved, which I highly doubt.",10Oct2019,0

104,"So, this is going to be very specific and weird, but i need to know why i'm feeling this way. I'm just really confused honestly.

(NSFW) So i was browsing through stuff on a certain animated porn site (e621) and i found something that... Upset me i guess? The website has tons of different tags for types of posts and i found a post with one that i forgot to blacklist, rape.

To be honest, it was no where near as bad as what it could've been, but for some reason it gave me this weird feeling of sadness(?). I'm not sure how to describe it",10Oct2019,1
105,"I can think of a lot of things that I MIGHT want to start doing... I'm good at drawing, I can probably start posting drawings and stuff. Other than that, I can write stories, poems, and anything else involving writing. I can also make silly games for myself or for my boyfriend (visual novels, RPGs, etc.).

However, the more I find things I want to do, the more difficult it is for me to find time to do any of it. Not only do I struggle with this, but also with daily routines. The more I learn about the many things I can try, such as getting new shampoo or dressing up differently, I forget about doing everything else.

I procrastinate a lot despite the fact that I make plans on my own. I can tell myself that I'll have to get out and buy groceries while doing this, eating that, but when the day comes, I'll wither forget about it or think about doing it the day after that. And the same happens the next day.

On the other hand, even if it seems as if I have things I WANT to do, I'm actually unsure. I want to do something that I can be proud of. Drawing, writing, doing what I love, it makes me happy, but is there something I can gain from it? I mean, apart from being able to share my works with people, I feel like it's not for me (somehow).

Basically, there's a lot of things I MIGHT want to do? But at the same time, I want to be productive. I want to learn new things. But I struggle a lot. I need advice.",10Oct2019,2

I never knew I could feel like this. I love you so much. I have a feeling this will last a long time and we really are good for each other. Not just like I said in my past relationships but I actually feel it. I feel myself growing. I am better and happier than ever. I feel emotions. I don't contemplate suicide all the time. I don't go through my day wishing for it to be evenimg so I can get wasted. I am grateful for this and I really, really appreciate it. And I appreciate you. So much.

108,"I just miss my people.

I'm 27 years of age, in a country whose language I do not speak fluently. I broke up with my girlfriend over a year ago. We probably had it coming. But she was still my friend. Until the end. I've met other women since, but something deep inside me is broken now. Or always has been, and all that break up did was kill the naivete that hoped something unbroken had persisted and would eventually come to the fore. I don't know.

I guess I'm an introvert, but more the sorts that seek social interaction but is quickly tired by it. Or I'm just an asshole. Feel free to read between the lines.

I guess what I'm trying, and failing, to communicate is that I feel like this is rock bottom, but it feels like it's been this way for a while now and that I seem to have found comfort in the troughs of life, rather than naturally progressing on to the next crest that life has always been advertised to be about. (yup, I know - fuck what 'they' told you about anything, making your experiences, your own ecosystem, etc - I know)

It's just exhausting sometimes. And so endlessly isolating.

109,"I overcame a mile stone today and I feel super proud of myself and wanted to share it. 

I suffer with anxiety and it has always got in the way of everything.. naturally. I’ve recently got a new job role within education and we had to do an interactive training day. 2 years ago this would have resulted in me freaking out and trying to get out of the room somehow/ being sick. Today I found some inner strength and participated. Not only that- I was vocal, involved myself in discussions and stood at the front conducting a micro lesson in a room full of professionals. Half way through my session I completely froze and for one split second I felt that anxiety rise and tap me on the shoulder. But today I grabbed that anxiety and I threw it out of the window with all my strength and I beat it, I even laughed at myself. Not only did I carry on, I did so with confidence and It was honestly the best feeling in the world.",10Oct2019,2

113,"About a year ago I quit using ecigs. I thought it was my one addiction, the one things I would always crave and want. It was really rough but I threw away all of my juice, coils, everything. About $400 worth of vape related products. And a few weeks ago I did it again. I was with a few friends that had an ecig and took a few hits. And I just felt like shit. Not mentally or anything, physically. There wasn’t the same rush, I just felt sick to my stomach and dizzy. Last night I decided that I probably just had an upset stomach from something else and tried it again. Nothing. No cravings, no rush, just sick and dizzy. Not sure what the point of this is besides the fact I can’t believe something that used to be so good is now so bad. Addiction is a funny thing, thinking back, I always used to feel like shit after taking a few puffs before but I guess that was my norm. I’m not upset with myself for trying it again because now I know. Anyways idk what this was, just wanted somewhere to put it.",10Oct2019,2

117,"I have realised this before, but I never thought about putting this into words. What I have always missed is someone to tell how I feel who I can trust. Not when I was in elementary or high school and not now, when I'm in college, either.

This isn't my parents, because they won't understand me on those things. My parents are conservative people, not the type of Americans with a rifle on the ranch, but they are orthodox christians. They're almost the opposite of the average redditor. My point is that I don't feel like they understand me. They would look at me like I'm crazy when I'd tell them I want to drink a beer sometime (which I haven't, even though it would be totally legal for me to do so). In short I can say they are very different from me. 

I don't have a best friend either. I mean I have some friends sure, but I don't share personal things with them. I am a bit of an introvert and I often hear introverts have few friends, but the friends they have are good friends. Well my friends aren't *that* good of friends. I mean they're nice guys don't get me wrong, they are also nice to me, but we just aren't that close. When something would be seriously wrong at home I wouldn't easily just tell them. 

I had two friends in high school in what I believe Americans call 'senior high', the upperhalf of the classes. I talked frequently to one of them one year after graduation, but that's not the case anymore. I could say we were somewhat close. At least I could share things with him, you know? We had similar hobbies and the same kind of humor. The only thing was that I couldn't really share things with him in the way that we really trusted eachother, I never told him there was this one girl in our class I liked during the 5 years we were in school together. Although we grew a bit out of eachother at the end, I could talk with him.

Nowadays I don't really feel like I don't have someone who I can talk to either. I have two friends who I just do groupprojects with and sit next to in class. Although they already do their groupproject of 2 persons with someone else and I have to find someone else to do the groupproject with, but I don't want to because they probably don't want to work with me and even if they would everyone would have a group anyway so I'd ask if someone doesn't have a 'groupmate' yet, followed by a silence in the whatsapp group because of those reasons and I just embarass myself by showing everyone no one likes me.

Anyway I don't have someone to talk to. My 'friends' aren't really relatable, if you know what I mean. One of them I don't really sit next to or talk to anymore. Understandable, because I most of the time sat to the other guy and talked to him while he kind of started talking and friending with others. But both of them are 'nintendo-players'. What's wrong with that? You may ask. I don't have any deeprooted hate for nintendo, but I just don't have anything with nintendo. The only thing I know about nintendo is that you have these things on which you can play mario cart. This guy also takes a huge nintendo ps (I think that's the right name?) to school. I just don't relate to any of that. I mean I don't hate him, he's a nice guy, but I just wouldn't know what to talk about with him. The same is true for the others in my class. And when you can't have *good* conversations with someone, it's hard to have close talks.

My point is that I just never had someone to share everything with I wanted. With the example above, when we had a crush we wouldn't share it with eachother. Or when something happened. And the guy in highschool was always closer to the other friend (the third guy) than to me. There were also series or games I played I was scared he thought were stupid. Because he said some of them were stupid (without knowing I played them). 

I just want to be able to answer someone honestly when they ask me: 'What did you do last weekend?', without feeling like I'm the weird guy. I just would want to say 'I scrolled through reddit, played this mobile game and watched a couple episodes this serie' without them looking weird at me and say 'That's it?' like partying is a superior way to spend your time. Maybe it is better, but I did this and we can't change anything about that. I don't have friends and don't want to go to a party.

129,"You know the very early stages of dating, after you’ve developed feelings but before you’re a couple? Where things are *kind of* still up in the air and you’re really not sure if things are going well or what they think of you? I’ve always figured that was normal, and I’m still pretty sure it is, to be a little insecure in the early stages of dating somebody, but I’m only just recently realizing my level of insecurity may not be normal. 

I recently started dating a girl, we’ve been on three dates now, about to go on our fourth next week, and I logically know it’s going really well. That said, I can’t help but constantly worry. Does she really like me? Does she want something serious? Would it scare her off if I asked her? Is she seeing other guys? Do I come off insincere? Are things moving too fast or too slow? Am I ignoring any red flags? Am I giving off any red flags? These questions and more run through my mind all hours of the day. 

This is always my experience with dating, and I usually find I have nothing to worry about. I know it will go away as things move forward, whether this blossoms into a relationship or not, but I can’t help feel like this is unhealthy. 

I’m not an anxious or insecure person whatsoever in other elements of my life, but without exception I am when it comes to dating. I’m fairly sure this comes from my dating history, which has been rocky at best. I have a terrible habit of ignoring or justifying glaring red flags, often without even realizing it.

130,"As an international student I have always been baffled by homeless people on the streets of Melbourne. I thought Australia has a program that makes sure homeless people got enough to eat? There are services to hire a bed for very cheap? And yet there are still homeless people everywhere. 

People around me says that those homeless people are guys who take Centrelink money because they work as beggars and they actually don't lack money, they probably spent all their money on drugs but this does not make sense because many of those guys look like real homeless (like the ones in my country, we don't have any programs to aid homeless people) 

I don't know what to think. I wanna give them money but I don't know if they are real homeless people or not, and I have to work my ass off illegally to stay here (many students even work for 10 aud per hour while the minimum wage is 20).

131,"I've been watching a lecture. One of the ideas inside was that there's a mechanism inside me that makes it so that life is bearable enough to live in it and bring more life to being, and that mechanism has more significance to my existence than the mechanism of thinking. 

What governs my actions is not rationality. Its something a lot older and powerful than that. Other animals probably have that at various levels, similar to the ability to play which is interspecies.

I'm not moving forward because I'm trying to impose my rationality or a vision I rationalized into reality, instead of paying attention to what my self tells me. I ignore what my self tells me because its terrifying and I try to replace the gap with my rationality or products of my thinking. Which rarely worked. Why? As I said earlier rationality's effect on my being in any way is a lot less stronger than the effect of the other thing I can't define with one word. Let's call that wisdom. I'll define that as the mechanism that takes actions so that being is worth suffering for. 

Paying attention and listening to what my self tells me, and hearing the ideas that appear when I pay attention, and then trying out that ideas. That's the right thing to do. I've been doing the opposite. Idk why. Idk why I'm so scared of doing that. Maybe its a pattern, a mode of being I'm trapped inside since infancy. Something I entered as a way of surviving in a hostile conflicting reality. 

I'm scared to get out because I never got out, I don't know what's outside and I'm going to be alone, vulnerable, in the unknown, unprotected and fully responsible. My instinct is to cover up, hide and wait. 

Its easier to live in a prison than to listen to what my self tells me and hear the thoughts that appear and apply them. Which is why I've been living in a prison. Which is why life sucks. Which explains everything.

Pros of getting out is real risks, real harm and excitement.
