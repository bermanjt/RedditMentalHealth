0,"I'm 18 and the person who interviewed me was this 22 year old lady. She was so kind and she told me that she really liked how dedicated I was at such a young age. She said she wished she could go back and commit to internship opportunities like me. It was not even an interview but more like an hour long conversation with a good friend I had just met. She even told me that she has been talking to her supervisor about me and picked me out of the applicants that applied. I have never been so happy while going for a job. It was so nice. 

We started the interview with a good conversation. She asked me if I wanted to drink coffee or water or anything. I asked for water. Then she asked me a few questions about the Congressman who I was to intern for as well as a few questions about myself. It turns out that I over-prepared. I researched the hell out of the Representative and the office and did 2 mock interviews while commuting (lol I just pretended to ask myself a question and then tried my best to answer it while maintaining an academic tone). In the actual interview, we both were talking in a very casual tone. I was using words such as ""gonna,"" ""cool,"" and more.  After all this over, she asked me that she went to the same university that I want to go to and loved my resume. We started talking about politics and our backgrounds and what made us drive towards the district office. 

In the end, we just started talking about college and other interests that we both had. She told me all about the office and how everyone operates. There are apparently just 5 people there, but they are nice as hell. She told me that the Congressman writes great Letters of Recommendation. She explained the daily tasks of the job and asked me for my schedule so we can arrange the time that I need to work (turns out that they're very flexible on schedule which is a great plus). This was the best interview of my life.",17Aug2019,10
2,"I used to have hobbies. And I was up for any event or any hangout with friends or family. Now, I often find myself wanting to stay inside all the time. I don‚Äôt want to see anyone or go anywhere I just want to lay in bed and do nothing. Answering calls and texts feels like a chore, and it takes me forever to gain the motivation to complete important tasks. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm depressed because I‚Äôm still pretty hopeful and happy. But right now, I‚Äôm just losing all of my desire to socialize. What‚Äôs happening to me?",17Aug2019,6
3,"I doubt anyone will read through all of this, but I desperately need to tell it to someone. Even just writing this, I owe it to her. I‚Äôm so sorry my sweet girl. I am so, so sorry. 

Tigger was there for me through everything in my life. She passed at 19, I‚Äôm 26. We adopted her when my parents were still married, and she‚Äôs been the only constant through everything; their divorce, moving, changing schools, college...no matter what went on, Tigger was there to greet me every morning and every time I came home. 

When my mom and I moved into a house (previously only apartments or rooms in a family member‚Äôs home) she lived outdoors by her choice. She was abused as a kitten before I adopted her so didn‚Äôt trust humans or being kept indoors. 

She was a silly girl, she liked to roll around in the snow and would sit outside in the pouring rain. She was an expert mouse hunter as well, so I let her do her thing while outfitting the garage with everything an indoor cat would have at their disposal. For the 12 years she lived in our house with the garage I kitted out, she was living the catty dream. 

She was always somewhat skittish, and forever hated to be picked up. She would very rarely jump into my lap as I sat outside with her, it only happened a few times in almost two decades. She was very vocal and she would tell me all about her day and what she thought about everything each morning, whenever I got home from work, and when I‚Äôd go outside to hang out with her. 

I woke up this past Thursday morning and went to bring her fresh food and water. She tried to come running to me, but her back legs weren‚Äôt working so well. She reached me and laid down, but still ate the food I brought out and drank some water. 

I wake up and go to work around 5:15, so no one was awake to offer advice. I called my mom who lives overseas, told her what was going on, and asked her what I should do. Tig had previously had some brief sicknesses from eating something bad or who knows what, each time it‚Äôs resolved in a few hours. My mom said that it was probably another one of those times, go to work for a few hours as Tig will likely be sleeping it off, and then re-evaluate. 

I knew in my gut that something was very wrong with my girl, but she was pressuring me hard and so I went to work. 

So, yeah. I ran, like the disgusting coward I now know I am. 

I worked for barely 30 minutes, scheduled a vet appointment within the hour, and raced to get back home. As I got into my car, my roommate called and said that I need to call a vet and tell them I need an emergency appointment. My roommate had come home to find Tigger in her cat bed, in a pool of her own urine. 

I won‚Äôt relay the details, but her final hour was horrific. I don‚Äôt know what exactly was wrong, but I imagine it was total organ failure. She was sedated quickly and passed away almost immediately after the euthanasia drugs were injected. 

A text post can‚Äôt explain all of it, but I‚Äôm glad it paints me in a bad light because I deserve it. I left my sweet and gentle girl alone until my roommate got there. I hate myself more than I can say. 

Tigger, I am so sorry. You deserved so much better than me. I know that I somehow managed to give you a great and comfortable life, but I failed you in your last few hours. I am so sorry, though that‚Äôs not even close to how terrible I feel. I miss you so much, and so do the indoor cats. They‚Äôve been waiting at the windows and doors trying to see you. 

I know you‚Äôre with your mom and sister now, I hope you‚Äôre having a wonderful time with them being reunited after all these years. Please forgive me for my cowardice and my lapse of judgment, I was scared and made the wrong decision under pressure. It is all my fault but I meant nothing malicious, never could have anything but love for you. 

I loved you dearly for most of my life, and I‚Äôll continue to do so forever. 

Rest In Peace, my sweetheart. I love you.",17Aug2019,103

5,"Don't mind my rambling here 

Met up with a girl on Monday for coffee and we hit it up pretty well. I could tell she liked me so I asked her out on a second date which we went on yesterday, and during that date it felt like we knew each other so well already? After the date, we share our first kiss and decide to meet up later that night. During that night we fooled around but also extremely affectionate with one another, holding hands, soft kisses, looking each other in the eyes. Typical teenage love bullshit (we are both in our early twenties btw).

Then she tells me she just got out of a 4 year relationship and that she wasn't looking for a boyfriend right now (also during the entire time we were talking she was meeting with other guys as well, telling me this mainly to complain about them lol). and well that really disappointed me because in my eyes this girl is perfect, we like a lot of the same stuff and she is really attractive and I converse so well with her.

She spent the night that night where we just cuddled together, held hands, and slept and woke up this morning doing pretty much the same stuff we did last night before she left that morning. I messaged her later asking when we could meet up next and she told me she was going to be out of town for the week so it'll have to be the following week and I'm like okay I'll hit you up then and see what my schedule is like. Then I told her I would be thinking about her whole she was gone and she was just like ""don't"".

So that's where that's at atm, we haven't spoken since that morning and she didn't reply to my last message and I realized I'm probably never going to get what I want out of this girl so I just deleted her number. I've been feeling like utter garbage the entire day

What exactly was she looking for? A fwb relationship or a one night stand? I asked her if this was gonna be one of those things where I would see her once then never again and she was like ""do I look like that kind of person to you?"" Well now I don't know. I've hooked up with people before and had my fair share of FwB and we never did any of the same sort of lovey dovey stuff with those people. Did I make the right call dropping her like that? I really did not want to continue getting attached.",17Aug2019,3

10,"This might be the wrong subreddit but i recently realized something

To start with some backstory. I was bullied for most of my childhood, for about 4 years no one cared about me and pushed me socially out of the class. Even the teachers knew, they just didn't care. I then moved to another city, where i felt like i had friends, who later turned out to just be friendly, they didn't care either. That is the reason that i for a couple years always doubted if people really liked me or if they just felt bad for me. 

At this point i was just used to people not caring, and when that happens you start to not care about yourself. so i also had suicidal thoughts for a couple of years (now, i would never take my own life)  now that i moved to a completely different area and i've actually gotten friends, i started doing stuff outside of school instead of just playing computer all day alone in my room.  My life has been really good (almost perfect if you ask me) for at least 2 years. Still when someone goes out of their way to do something nice for me, or when they are friendly and i don't feel like it's an act, i get surprised, and it's every time. 

I think the reason for that is that it's hard to get used to such a change, when you've had at least 7 years where no one cared about you, you barely felt like your parents did, and then from one day to another it flips. so now you have friends that do care A LOT.  One of my friends moved the date for the celebration of her birthday for god's sake. 

I'm not used to people caring, and i don't think i'll ever be and honestly. I don't think i want to be, because the happiness i feel when something like that happens is indescribable.

11,"I just told myself this tonight. No matter what drugs I try, there's something more addictive. Dextroamphetamine, alcohol, dextromethorphan, weed, and nicotine are good, but cutting is so different. It holds this special feeling for me. Something nothing else can touch.

It's not more euphoric, isn't any greater, or anything else like that... But it just feels *good.* Something nothing can touch. Nothing. Not even a high dose of dextroamphetamine can make me feel *good.* It makes me feel *great,* but never good. I always feel disconnected from any decent feelings. Nothing I've really felt, I've *felt.*

I've never been truly addicted to burning or anything like that, but it's just cutting. I hate it. I wish I'd be addicted to burning instead. I have done it before. It's not the same, at all.

The one good thing about never feeling anything is I can easily bottle things up and push them to the back. 

However, cutting is the one thing that every once in a while, makes an immense resurgence. It's too attractive to forget every time I'm overloaded and breaking down. Nothing beats that feeling.

I can settle for drugs, but they won't satisfy the feeling of being *good,* only the feeling of euphoria or decency. But it's an empty feeling. Enough to get me by, but not to get me right.

I haven't fallen back on cutting in months, I don't care how many because counting doesn't keep me going, it just keeps it at the front of my mind. Every cut I get scars over, and they never go away. I know why, it's a somewhat rare condition that could link this to me irl. That's why I quit.

The actual direct reason is a huge cut that is now a scar, that I made long ago. The scars are in a somewhat good location, at least. I'm seriously done cutting, it's just an immense urge sometimes. Drugs get me through, and they're healthier than what I was doing before them. So I guess for now, they're a part of my life.",17Aug2019,0

13,"I‚Äôm sitting in LGA airport and I had to write this somewhere. 

Background: my cousin has a terrible disease that will eventually take her life, she‚Äôs 13. My uncle has since dedicated his entire life to becoming apart of the main research team for the cure of her disease

Three years ago he held a charity banquet in Gotham Hall in nyc for his daughter to get funding for more research 

My entire family showed up from around the country, like 40-50 people. My mom, who is a very anxious and insecure person, got black out drunk and for some reason cursed out my uncle and embarrassed her and my dad, and ruining a lovely night that was about my cousin and my dads brothers family. 

Since then my mom has cut herself off from my dads family out of her own shame and embarrassment. She‚Äôs made up lie after lie to avoid seeing them, including not coming to Christmas last year. It‚Äôs torn my dad apart and has ostracized my immediate family from everyone else. 

My cousins wedding is tomorrow and my dad told my mom if she didn‚Äôt go he wouldn‚Äôt forgive her. My mom and I have a rough relationship, but I called her this week and got her to admit she‚Äôs been avoiding my uncle and aunt for years and that she knew she‚Äôd have to confront them this weekend. 

I spent lots of time with my aunt and uncle last year alone and realized that my dads family is nothing but love and forgiveness. 

After years of avoiding her fears out of shame my mom just texted me that she apologized to them in person and that they were forgiving and gracious and I feel like there‚Äôs a huge part of my life that we can all finally move on from. 

My mom is notoriously weak and scared and I‚Äôm really impressed and proud that she faced her fears. I feel like because of this my family can move forward and sort of start over a little bit, and I‚Äôm just so happy. 

TLDR: After year‚Äôs of avoiding her fear, my mom finally apologized to my dads side of the family and now we can move forward",17Aug2019,3

17,"So, my daughter (12 yr old) has autism and down syndrome. She can't talk, so she uses a touch screen device (I call it a ""talker"".) For Thanksgiving, my husband, daughter and I went to my mother in law's (I'll just refer to her as G). She has a granddaughter (my niece) visiting from college. G fixed us dinner and we hung out at the house. At some point, G and my husband start having an in depth conversation in the living room, and my daughter starts yelling. (Sometimes she does that because she can't communicate and wants someone to pay attention to her. I think she was jealous because Daddy wasn't talking to her). G eventually yells and tells her to ""Stop it!"" Then we get into an argument about whether I discipline my child enough. G seems to think I don't discipline her enough because even though my daughter can't talk, she knows what's going on (Which is true- my child is very aware). My husband decides it's time to go home, since everyone is so upset. I'm pretty pissed because I don't appreciate someone yelling at my child like that, especially since she's autistic. It's super unnerving to my kid, and my kid knows when people are talking about her when she's right in the room.

My niece messages me and asks if I'm okay. She tells me she's sorry about her grandma's behavior, but to try not to talk it personally because she has a hard time understanding things. I will admit, G has been acting confused lately. My husband has questioned whether she has dementia or not. However, it's hard for me to not take it personally since this is about my kid.

We are a family of Christians, and I texted my niece and said, ""I don't believe you're grandma is a Christian. She only loves you, nobody else. She's always been judgmental. I know that you don't see her that way because she's raised you, but I have HISTORY with this woman. She used to hate me when my husband and I dated as teenagers."" My niece responded, ""I will talk to you about this later.""

I decide to block my niece on FB because I felt like she was blowing me off.

My niece calls back later and says she wasn't trying to ignore me. She says she WAS going to talk to me later, but she didn't know how to respond to me because I said her grandma (who was basically her mom) wasn't a Christian. She said she didn't want to reply in anger, so she told me she'd talk about this later. I said, ""I mean, HOW is your grandmother a Christian? She never tries to see her kids or anything. She doesn't live it out at all. She just stays in her house and eveyrthing is all about her.""

Eventually we talk it out and attempt to see eye to eye. I unblocked my niece.

18,"Hi Reddit,

I am 30 years old and this may be a long story but need to vent.

I grew up poor in New York. My parents would walk the streets hoping to find change on the side of the road just to get by and use the money so my brother and I could have a semi decent childhood. When I was old enough I got my first job at 15 and helped out my family as much as I could, even though it wasn‚Äôt much. I spent a lot of my adolescence working and dealing with poverty in the inner city and started hanging out with some questionable people. I would smoke weed and drink at the age of 15 just to bypass the stress of living a poor life. Fast forward a tad bit... I managed to graduate high school when I was 17 (barely) but escalated my escape from reality into heroin. The money I would make from my jobs went from support to addiction, ultimately resulting in my loss of a means to support my family. Everyday I would shoot heroin just to get by and forget the pain of life. I would steal, rob, and lie just for a few bucks for my fix. I would even steal from my already poor family. This went on for 2 and a half years non stop.

At 20 I caught a break when a close friend of mine said he was moving to Florida within the week and asked if I wanted to go. I really wanted to stop my addiction and managed to agree to go with him. We drove down to Florida from new york at the end of the week with me withdrawing in the back seat. All I had was a couple pairs of clothes and an air mattress. Stopping cold turkey was probably one of the most painful experiences of my life. I spent a good two years in Florida enjoying life sober and living life happy. 

At 22 I got a call from my mother who was now living in Arizona that my grandma had developed lung cancer. Most of my immediate family lived there so I decided to make another change in my life and move there. I wanted to make amends for all my wrong doing and support my family again. I drove from Florida to Arizona in my shitty car that I managed to buy in Florida. I moved in with my mother and grandma to help take care of them. I never went to college after high school and figured with all the changes in my life that I should go. 

At 24 my grandma beat lung cancer, I found a great career, and I met a beautiful girl. Things were finally going great. Things were pretty steady for 5 years, working full time, having friends in my life, traveling, and helping my family and actually buying a house.

At 29 things came crashing down on me..... I married the beautiful girl in my life and we tried to get pregnant. We managed to but a few weeks later it ended up in a miscarriage... the same day we found out about the tragedy I got a call from my doctor about some blood work I gave.... I had hepatitis c. Things spiraled downward and my wife developed a mental illness and I fell into a depression. 

I‚Äôm 30 now and turning 31 next Friday and my wife is in an institute until next Thursday (the day before my birthday). I still have a student loan debt, massive credit card debt, I‚Äôm living paycheck to paycheck, and everytime it rains my roof leaks. Sometimes I feel like there‚Äôs a constant black cloud above my head and I just want a normal life. I‚Äôm tired of waking up every morning just to exist and pay my debts.

P.S. I did get treatment for my hepatitis c and it‚Äôs a 3 month treatment. Just finished my first month and bloodwork and it showed undetectable for the virus. I just need to finish the treatment now.",17Aug2019,5
19,"So someone I work with that has worked this job in the past has offered me a good recommendation towards my dream job with a large possibility of getting hired. I‚Äôd start to travel across the west coast of America, all expenses paid (flight, food, and hotel), fixing race cars in the pits for about $20hr starting.

This would mean I would have no time for a relationship because this is a 12hr a day job and it would be difficult for my girlfriend to travel with me and hold a job just to see me come back to a hotel and fall asleep. We have both agreed that a long distance relationship would not work.

That was all I had going for me. And it‚Äôs nothing. I used to crochet but I can‚Äôt even finish that. I can‚Äôt draw I can‚Äôt crochet and I can‚Äôt do anything right. I can‚Äôt make new friends I can‚Äôt find anyone to date. My younger siblings are moving on with their lives and having homes and families and I‚Äôm just as useless and nothing as I was ten years ago. 

I just want to scream. I don‚Äôt want to do anything. I don‚Äôt want to be here. I don‚Äôt want anything. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm even saying I just have no one to talk to. I used to call the suicide line but they figured out what city I‚Äôm in and now I can‚Äôt bring myself to call. I keep trying to but it just scares me now because the place that answers is in my city and I can‚Äôt do that.

I just want this all to stop. I don‚Äôt want to do this anymore. I can‚Äôt do this anymore, I can‚Äôt sleep and wake up and still feel like this. I‚Äôm sick of trying I‚Äôm sick of doing this. I‚Äôve been trying and trying for years and I‚Äôm only feeling worse and worse and I can‚Äôt do this anymore. I can‚Äôt do this anymore. I can‚Äôt keep trying I can‚Äôt. 

I need help I just want someone to help me I just want help and I don‚Äôt want to feel like this and I‚Äôm not doing this on purpose I don‚Äôt want to feel like this and I don‚Äôt want to be like this and I don‚Äôt know what else to do and I‚Äôm sorry.

people just aren't trying and shit, and i found out that the school is cutting our funding in half. people aren't trying as much as other people have, and I feel alone in the fact that i really want to do good this year, but the cut in funding means we have to fundraise a lot now and i'm already doing a bunch of other shit and i'm just tired.

i go to a shitty charter school for kids who get kicked out of other ones, and like it's just disheartening to see my friends not give a fuck.

34,"This may be a bit long, I do apologize.

I wanted something different from the politicians. Something different than the establishment. Something different from a Clinton.

I have been a staunch Republican all my life. I'm quite old, some folks likely (probably) wish my generation would just die off. I've never voted Democrat. Some say they voted for Trump because the other option was Hillary. I can not boast that claim in an attempt to save face. I voted Trump because I truly thought he was the one. Yes, I would have voted for him anyway, but I really did think he was special. He was something different. Trump felt like the ignition the Republican party desperately needed. He felt like a straight shooter, an outlaw in the political spectrum. A guy that wouldn't take handouts or make excuses. It looked to me like he was going to put the American people first.

I enjoyed the fire he brought to the debates--all of them. I enjoyed his bluntness and willingness to say what the average American would say and not try to hide his intentions under political jargon. It was refreshing. It felt like a breath of fresh air in a stale smelling basement. He made his blunders along the way, but my thinking was ""everyone has made mistakes"".

Everyone knows what happened. Trump got elected. I went to many of his rallies. The crowd was popping. Smiles were abundant and laughter was plenty. We did it. We got him in. We beat Hillary.

I remember hugging another man out of sheer excitement. This man was a farmer. He wasn't another man, he was my friend. I knew him since childhood. I went to his house that night and we drank ourselves silly of moonshine. Trump was in, Clinton was out, I can drink to that--yeah.

I start to read reports about Russia. Being an old soggy bastard, I hate Russia. Not the people of Russia--no. Their government. I hate everything about the Republic of Russia.

They interfered in the election I hear. The way I come to terms with this- Trump lost the majority of votes, but he won the electoral college. If Russia hacked it, he would have won the majority.

I played a lot of mind gymnastics with myself. I dulled myself down to believe in absurd truths.

I am skipping a lot of events, but lets go to the ""children in cages"" dilemma.

I am against any kind of illegal immigration. I believe you should legally come over and contribute. I'm not trying to get into a political argument at all by this post.

I saw the pictures and read testimonies of people that were in those cages. Listen, as I said, I disagree with illegal immigration, but these are still humans. They are our species. They are just kids. I'm far from a think tank candidate, but there has to be a better way. Those conditions are deplorable and sickening. A good friend fought in World War II. I am not comparing those cages to gas chambers--I know some like to compare it to concentration camps, but my friend who fought in World War II told me that he fought along side his brothers to rid those camps from the Earth. He said he never imagined anything of resemblance being on American soil in this day and age.

But still, I looked the other way. I disrespected my friend and everyone who suffered in any kind of camp. I thought: Well, they are illegal. Perhaps they should not have come over. At this point I had a swell in my throat. I knew what I was saying was wrong, but I'm a Republican, damnit. I stay loyal to my party.

I get a call from my friend who was at the rally shortly after Trump took office. The one I hugged in pure joy. There was silence on the other end. I said hello, not sure if he was still there. His first words were, after 30 seconds of silence: I'm out of business.

I asked him what he meant. He said the tariffs were making it impossible to net a profit. He was *losing* money like he had a hole in his pocket. He lost the farm and his house. He's currently saddled up with his brother.

This is going to seem silly. It was the final straw that broke the camels proverbial back, I guess. You would think it would be Russia, the immigration centers. My good friend losing everything. No. It was a Tweet.

*It would show great weakness if Israel allowed Rep. Omar and Rep.Tlaib to visit. They hate Israel &amp; all Jewish people, &amp; there is nothing that can be said or done to change their minds. Minnesota and Michigan will have a hard time putting them back in office. They are a disgrace!*

Yes. He has indeed tweeted some crazy things. Maybe crazier than this. I don't follow all his online ramblings, but this was it. To say two people hate an entire group of people and a country is absolutely ludicrous. It's something you would hear on a school yard. ""Don't pick Gene for red rover, he hates all the girls!""

Yes, I know. It shouldn't have taken me this long to come around. You could throw a million different instances where Trump has done something awry and ask why the hell I didn't change my stance. I would tell you that I am a fool, and that I am sorry.

I watch Fox News and it's just become more pitiful by the day. When did the Republican party get so soft? When did they get offended by everything? People like to say the democrats are sensitive, but the yelling by all the Republicans during the public Muller hearing was embarrassing. Trump's constant need to lash out at anyone who sleights him is reminiscent of a child. I used to think it was ""cool"". I used to think it's what made him different. Not afraid to stand up to anyone and tell it like it is. But now that my eyes are open, he's actually done very little of that. It's mostly actions unbecoming of a child.

The Republican party used to have values. They touted greater personal responsibility. Family values. Small government and letting the citizens decide how to run their lives.

It's none of that anymore. It's not what I signed up for. I drape my head in shame, for I feel a personal burden having voted for Trump. This country has been absolutely torn apart. And I am a little bit responsible for that.

I am sorry to my family.

I am sorry to my friend.

I am sorry to all the children away from their families.

I am sorry America.

For the first time in 98 years, if God has me billed to live, my last vote on this Earth will be for a Democrat.",17Aug2019,366
35,"So I am an incredibly indecisive person, and I had been toying with the idea of transferring colleges for the past 6 months. I am going in to my sophomore year and spent the first year at an out of state college that is far away from my home. I chose this college because it had good opportunities for my intended major, linguistics. However, looking back I had a gut feeling telling me to not go to the out of state college. I dismissed this as simply fear of change and leaving my family, and decided to go anyways. The first semester started out rough, but I attributed this to homesickness. Towards the end of the first semester, I joined the fencing team, and I really enjoyed that.

However, second semester came and I started to feel different. I got into classes for my major, and I started to feel confused. The classes for my major did not seem that interesting. I started zoning out in class, and I honestly began dreading to go there every day. The 3 main reasons that I went there turned out to be kind of disappointing. However, I did find other reasons to be there like the fencing team, mountains, and the plentiful healthy food options. Soon, I felt oppressed by the intense desert heat that started to begin towards the end of the school year. I felt like I had to get out of there at whatever cost. I would wake up feeling angry because I didn't listen to my intuition at the very beginning, and may have been stuck in a state I didn't like because of a major I didn't want anymore. I went to an out of state tournament with my fencing team, and it was the happiest that I had felt in months. But when I returned, I was back to feeling down and sad all day, waiting for each day to end so I could be one step closer to leaving.

After coming home, I had to make the decision of whether to transfer to my in state college. For the entire summer, I have been ruminating about this decision nonstop. It has made me so tired and frustrated. My mom would always ask me which decision, and nearly every time I would say that I was leaning towards transferring. The price of the out of state with scholarship was not too different from in state without, so money wasn't a big issue. There are a lot of good things about the in state college, such as a very supportive advisor and proximity to family. I can keep doing some of the things that I picked up at the out of state college like fencing and eating healthy, although they will be harder to do at this college.

Well, yesterday was the final decision day. I had been enrolled at both colleges, and had to drop classes and housing at one of them or else I would get very large cancellation fees. I had new student enrollment at the in state college two days prior and I started crying in front of my advisor because of the stress of the decision. I ended up deciding to transfer to the in state college since I was leaning towards that most of the summer and had the gut feeling to not go to the out of state beforehand. Figured that there probably would not be some huge revelation in the next 24 hours that would reverse all the times that I said I was leaning towards transferring, and I dropped the housing at the out of state.

It is the next morning, and I woke up feeling incredibly nervous. I am worried that I made the wrong decision. This is mainly because I was not sure whether my push to transfer was because of genuinely not liking the state and university I was at or because I was feeling homesick. It's not like I felt horrible there all the time, after all. I would say my mood throughout the school year looked similar to a bell curve. I am worried that I left all my friends on the fencing team simply because I was homesick. Could it have been better to try one more semester and see how that turned out? After making the decision, I felt relieved for a bit, but indecision and doubt quickly began to creep in. I am really worried that I chose wrong, and that I will regret this decision later. I have yet to tell my friends at the out of state college (and cancel a few things). I just wanted to share how I felt after this long period of indecision, and hope that anyone can offer me some insight.",17Aug2019,1

I loved him so much, so much it made me blind to just how bad things were getting. Anytime I would state something simple, he would disagree with me about seemingly everything.

46,"For the last 2 months I‚Äôve been dating a fine, young lady. We weren‚Äôt extremely serious, but were spending a lot of time together and had some amazing chemistry. We spent a lot of time together and the sex was well, amazing.. Every time we spent time together it seemed as if we radiated off of each other (cheesy I know) She seemed really into me. The feeling was mutual. I‚Äôm hesitant about dating, but thought with her I would give it a chance. So I let my guard down. Thought I‚Äôd try things out. 

She is a foreign exchange student from South America, and the first ‚Äútrue‚Äù foreign girl I‚Äôve dated. She was super sweet and fun to be around. She recently found out she will have to finish her masters program in Seattle. But we agreed to continue seeing each other until she moves. We figured we‚Äôd keep things simple, but still date and sleep with each other. With all things considered, things were going well. 

Then poof! She blocked my number. Yesterday I tried texting her and my messages would instantly send without saying ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù, and I would call, and it would go straight to voicemail. (My ex was very toxic and dramatic and would block me a lot over arguments, so trust me, I know she has me blocked). Tried communicating with her today, still to no avail. So I get on the dating app we met on, and guess who I see online? Which is fine, I still talk to women on there as well. I‚Äôm upset because it is pretty much solid proof that she blocked my phone number. I‚Äôm confused as to why though? Things were going so well. No fighting, no clinginess or toxic bull shit, we both knew which direction we were going, but agreed to have a good time until then. So why would a woman just block a guy like that? She seemed very honest and I figured she would be the kind of woman to tell a guy what‚Äôs up. 

So any suggestions? Should I send her a message on the dating app asking why she blocked me?",17Aug2019,3
48,"For context, I moved away from my hometown 8 years ago. About 1,000 miles away. My relationship with my parents had always been turbulent at best.

Since I've moved, my dad has flown out here twice. He said ""that's enough"" and hasn't been here for several years. When he did come visit, all he did was read the newspaper, do crossword puzzles, go outside to smoke, and then leave to go to the bar. I've told him that he's not welcome back.

My mom had flown out about twice a year until our first child was born, then she started coming four times a year. Every time she comes out, I have to take the day off of work the days of her flight to drive 2 hours to the airport, and then 2 hours back home.

49,"7 months ago I met her. Quickly showed interest and shortly after we started to get to know each other. We share classes at Uni so it was easy to frequently see each other. Fast forward to our first date. Here's where I start to realize we don't click too much, since we often struggle holding interesting conversation and a fun vibe. I choose to ignore it since it's both of our first experiences and I thought it'd get better with time. At the end of the date, I let her know that I like her. She says she likes me back. 

Thereafter, not much progress is made. On our second date, she hugs me. Around this time I start to develop strong feelings for her and confess my love. Meanwhile a problem arises that makes me consider walking away, even though I love her to pieces. She tells me she doesn't know if she loves me back. She doesn't know what she feels but she doesn't want to lose me either. She's always made it clear she has trouble showing/feeling emotion. She said she doesn't know why these things come so slowly to her and it bothers her. 

I still went in for a kiss on our second last date. Wasn't held back and we shared several long kisses. Intimate moments. The issue above was mentioned by her again. 

Yesterday was our last date. The date went good actually. A fun vibe was set, to my surprise.  At the end I tried to kiss her but was held back. She explained she wants to feel something first. She also told me she doesn't wanna waste my time. 

I love her. But I also want to make the right decision here. I feel like we can figure things out! I really do! On the other hand I feel like I might end up hurting myself a lot. Very confused and frustrated at the moment. She said she wants to keep hanging out, if I'm down for that. 

TL;DR : 7 months in and she doesn't know what she feels for me. Don't know if I should keep seeing. I do love her to though.

It feel reminded of reading about history and feeling viscerally appalled by some systematic injustice but at least having solace that it's not happening now. Not that we don't have our problems, but they at least feel complicated enough to me  that I can understand why people would get this wrong - climate change is about the far-ish future, minority rights about people with experiences most can't directly relate to. But ""not raping kids"" is as obvious as a moral tenet can possibly be.

I'm not surprised that these circles exist, if anything, it would be strange if they didn't. I read a study once claiming that about one sixth of straight men feels greater-or-equal attraction to pubescent girls as to adult women. One sixth out of powerful people with no empathy is still a bunch.

But this whole thing has been so obvious and out in the open and it's almost certain that all institutions capable of prosecuting the people involved have been corrupted. Worse, it looks like the media have been scared or paid off into submission to the point that we don't even get the quiet solace of a proper investigation and outrage story, just ""another unlikely thing happened, how mysterious"" pieces that leave me even more frustrated.

For about a week every month, when I try to go to sleep strange things happen and I have no bloody clue if it's normal or not. Two different things can occur:


1: Auditory hallucinations. As I close my eyes, as I start to relax I can hear a whole range of things. It could be a motorbike that sounds like it's driving around my room, people talking about me , or elevator music. Part of me thinks it could be something to do with my brain getting ready to dream or whatever. It usually doesn't scare me, it's just annoying as it's quite loud usually. 


2. I'm not sure not to describe this one. It's like I can see through my eyelids when I close my eyes. But the world is different when looking through my eyelids. For example, in reality I will just be lying in bed doing nothing, but when I close my eyes I see through them and It looks like I'm using my phone, even though I'm not. I can even rapidly open and close my eyes to switch between 'world's'. Again, I believe this may be related my brain getting ready to dream. 


All of this only ever happens when I'm trying to sleep. I'm certain I'm not actually dreaming these things because I can get up and walk around and still experience them for a short period of time. 


Although I've had problems with my mental health before, I don't believe this is one of those issues as this is nothing like I've experienced before. I just want to know if anyone else has experienced something like this and if it goes away at some point.

2. I am 19M from Middle class family , i am an average student and after i did my school in 2017, things between me and mom started to get better cuz i was not getting a college for a course i was gonna do, and i was to be blamed as i was not good at studies


I am gonna be really honest i am dumb ,boring, shy, attention seeker , drama , possessive, crybaby

So in that 2yr period i also stopped talking much to my family at first they were concern because i have a really close relation with my mom and sisters but later they got  furious about this all drama of me not talking to them for no reason , and i didn't wanted to i don't know why but i couldn't? I felt sad , angry , but didn't had any solution

My friends tried to call me but i wouldn't pick up calls i didn't wanted talk to anyone 


Fast forward i joined an online community and there i met few peoples and they were nice i eventually started spending more time there chatting most of the time , which i think was cuz i didn't talk to anyone in these past months so it was a whole new thing for me , making new friends online , so i for 3-4 months it was really good and i made these 5 friends and one of them was this person S , with whom i became a really good friend maybe because of the attention she gave me , telling me she is excited when chatting with me , she would say i am the best person she met online, that would get my self esteem high
And when everyone is talking to each other except me she would bring up my name and tell i am good person 

Maybe she was trying to help?

But after some time she became less online after i asked she told me i can join her discord as she will be more online there so i did, but there we don't talk much , like she is really nice to me as always but now i am getting more jealous if she talks to other ppl, and now she haven't replied to my DMs since 7 days and she is online and would talk in group chat ,this happened 2 times earlier but she apologized for it but till then i was already feeling horrible and depressed cuz i was overthinking about why she didn't check my inbox if she didn't get notification , does she want me to disappear?

And i also think i started to have crush on her but i am not sure , as this jealous thing happens with everyone , if any of my friends talk to someone new. And she also have a boyfriend, Or maybe i don't have crush its just a Hormonal thing, idk what i feel but i think it's not worth it. 
So if i don't tell her this maybe i will feel more in love with her... And if i confess maybe these feelings will fade away after sometime but she might think of me as a disgusting creep and what if she tells this to our common friend and they laugh at me? She wouldn't do anything bad to me but i am really scared of how things will get
I feel like i betrayed her as she was was a really great friend

I don't know if i am thinking too much , but now i am crying about it all night cuz like the only person who was nice to me has forgotten me? Maybe i was annoying or a creep to her?

After four years of being uncertain as to when my cycle would start, I finally started today. I should mention that I'm am not a young girl, I'm almost an adult. I don't really know why I am saying this, but for years now, it's been something that's stressing me out because I've been worried that there is something wrong with me physically, but so now I am very relieved that I should be fine.",17Aug2019,575

69,"~ since I am not sure where to post this, I will be doible posting it on r/selfimprovement and r/self ~

Hello everyone, I feel like I should be telling the whole thing, so I will start where everyone starts.

I am 17 years old male currently living in a small country in the middle of Europe. Since the early childhood, I have been raised and taught to respect others, be polite and be helpful. Both my parents are very good people and they have been a great example, of course, when I became older, I started to question and even disagree with some behaviour of theirs, which is - I believe - perfectly normal. 

Since I was 5 or 6, I was always the polite and respectful ‚Äúguy‚Äù and I felt like I didn‚Äôt belong to the group of kids that was around me. I was always trying to help others as much as I could (which others often used to their advantage) and I often sacrificed myself for others, this was a thing until I finished my 9 years in primary school - I was 15. I guess I became a bit more egoistic and I realised that sacrificing myself would never bring me success and happiness in life, 14 - 15 was also the age in which I became much more interested in girls and so I also started to care about my look. Mother sometimes calls me narcisstic and I have to agree, sometimes I care a bit too much and I am a bit too insecure about the way I look.

I feel like I am somewhere ahead of my peers, almost like I am more mature than them, just because they often talk about stuff I don‚Äôt really find interesting or laugh on things that aren‚Äôt funny, I also have thoughts that make me feel 80 years old. I don‚Äôt like to think that I am more ‚Äúmature‚Äù than them, because I think it is an egoistic thought. 

Last 2 years, I have been thinking about my future way too much, setting my life goals and changing the way I think for the better. I appropriated the opinion that I have to believe myself in order to reach my goals and I shouldn‚Äôt let fear and doubts get ahold of me, since these emotions have nothing to offer, they will make the journey only way more inconvenient and harder. I want to believe in myself so hard, but I am afraid that somewhere along the way, I will become too egoistic and I will lose my current self. 

I don‚Äôt want to be perfect. I want to be a person with heart on the right spot, I want to be self-conscious, purposeful, polite, conscientious and capable. I want to be a person who will care and help others but won‚Äôt sacrifice his happiness, I want to be so much more... and I believe I can achieve this. Yet, even though I managed to lock away the doubts about my material goals, I can‚Äôt seem to do so with the doubts about my future inner self. What if I somewhere, somewhen slip and I‚Äôll become someone I never wanted to be? 

I figured out those are my never leaving fears - becoming a person that thinks way too much about himself and also loosing something I already have - mainly when it comes to my behaviour or skills and not the material side of life.

There is so much more to this... I wish you could just see my thoughts and understand everything. Sorry for being emotional, that‚Äôs the way I am.",17Aug2019,1

73,"My brother is housing me for the weekend while I meet one of my only long-distance friends from a foreign country. I leave tomorrow and will be out of the house most of today, but I feel really harrassed and unwelcome.

I'm a libertarian realist-leaning-nihilist and I have so little interest in politics. I was not raised religious and I do not believe in God. I'm respectful of other people's religions and if they feel comfortable and want to have faith or politely ask if I'll join them for church, I'll normally oblige and say sure. It makes me very uncomfortable to be in churches, even for weddings and funerals, so my visits are few and far between. 

Now, I'm used to my brother ailing me about politics and religion. His brand of intolerance for people who think differently than him are normal for me, and I know he loves me even though I don't agree with him because I'm his sister. He genuinely doesn't want to convert me to Christianity, but he does typically ask a lot of me when I'm with him by telling me he thinks it'll benefit me even though I'm uncomfortable. 

He's homophobic (I'm bisexual but in a heterosexual relationship (with another bisexual)), but he still states he loves me and he doesn't care about my sexuality. I can deal with him. He's easy, though he does make me feel a little crazy for having such different opinions to him.

His girlfriend is similar but a little more tame. However, she believes women are the weaker sex and it's ""difficult for women to talk to assertive men"" because we're naturally more docile or something. I disagree so wholeheartedly but she's so kind and welcoming and I genuinely do enjoy her, so I don't argue with her like I would with my brother.

His roommate has officially made me feel completely awful.

He believes I'm purposeless because I don't want to have children, has told me multiple times that if he hands me a knife that I would probably kill myself because of my mentalities (which isn't true) and has tried and is still trying desperately to convert me to Christianity. He says that socialists deserve to die and liberals and leftists are ""snowflakes"" and he got drunk when my brother and his girlfriend had to leave me alone so they could go to work and harrassed me for several hours about my beliefs.

I feel so incredibly unwelcome thanks to him. He says that holding my mentalities mean that my brain function has been stopped at such a young age and I'll never learn to adapt or change my ways. All because I don't believe in God.

He won't leave me alone. He constantly tells me to watch stuff or do stuff and refuses to let me exist peacefully. He says that because he has three kids he's ""winning"" because he passes his philosophy down. I said ""if my philosophy is nothing, aren't I winning by spreading nothingness?"" and he kept attacking me, basically telling me that my purpose is nothing without kids.

I'm just miserable. I want to leave, but I have one more night here and I don't have any other friends here besides my buddy who I'm visiting today.",17Aug2019,1
74,"Sometimes when i get stressed out i call friends, to get high, if they cant come over then i give my cat some catnip then smoke some weed and have deep emotional conversations with him.

75,"This has been on my mind a lot. Last year, I ended up living in the dorms again even though I was a college junior (yeah, Ik that's probably weird). My roommate was a freshman and we talked in the summer. During welcome week, we were friendly, but I found her a bit difficult to talk to. She gave me ""stereotypical popular/mean high school vibes, but I tried to ignore it because I didn't want to judge too quickly. I'm a naturally quiet/introverted person (unless I know someone very well), so even though I tried to talk to her during the first few weeks, I eventually stopped making the initial move because I was more focused on school and work, and I like to have space. There were a couple times when I'd wave at her in the lobby or hallway, and she wouldn't look at me or she'd look away. I think I might've made a judgment too soon, but I was under the impression that she thought she was too good for me or something. However, sometimes she would offer me things in the room. One time she was like, ""Do you want some cough medicine?"" I said, ""Oh, I'm okay. I just have mucous in my throat."" She's like, ""You know, they have medicine for that.""

After a few months....I discovered bed bugs in my bed. I was nervous to talk to her because I thought she would blame me...but I was like, ""...Hey...do you know what this is?""

She looks at my bedding and says, ""hmm I think it's mold...no wait...yeah those are bed bugs. Go tell the RA.""

So I told the RA, and the RA called in pest control to check it out. Pest control confirmed we had bed bugs and that we had to schedule a day for them to chemically treat our room, meaning we had to dry all of our stuff on high heat and bag everything, just to move it back into the room when they finish treating it....We scheduled it on a Tuesday and we started packing our things. I definitely felt like there was tension between us. She was like, ""Are we getting reimbursed for this?"" (in a passive-aggressive voice) Then there was a pause and she asked, ""You don't know, do you?"" I'm like, ""Yeah....Idk sorry."" I was really pissed because in my mind she was saying, ""Do you know if we'll get reimbursed? Afterall, you're the one that had them in your bed and it's not my fault."" I was upset and had a project that I needed to work on that night with a group. I left the room and when I came back, she had a guy over without telling me someone else was going to be in our room. With everything going on, I started taking my stuff to the laundry room/bagging everything, and I slammed the door a few times.

Fast forward a week later, I get an email from my RA saying she wants to talk to me about concerns my roommate was having. I met with her.

The RA gets out the roommate agreement and tells me ""Ok she mentioned overall cleanliness of the room and that she was only one taking out the trash. She says that you weren't keeping your things on your side of the room (That was a lie), and that you leave the lights on too late, and sometimes your basket is in the way...but I want to know what YOU Think about this?""

I said, ""ummm those are really easy things to fix. Why can't she just tell me that?""

The RA ""Yeah....she says it's an unfriendly environment, that she thinks you'll judge her and she doesn't feel safe. She doesn't want the 3 of us to meet because she's afraid of you"" I'm like,""....What? Why? I never threatened her or anything.""

RA: ""Yeah, I'll write down your feelings about this, and then the 3 of us can have another meeting soon. I'll have my graduate supervisor sit in on the meeting as well.""

I leave, and I call my friends. I'm bawling over the phone, and I'm like, ""I don't understand why she'd say she doesn't feel safe?"" They basically said I wasn't scary and that she is probably just afraid of confrontation.

When the RA and I met, the graduate supervisor couldn't make it, so it was just me, my roommate, and the RA. I don't think I did myself justice.

I said, ""I have a right to be upset. Why did you say I made you feel unsafe???"" My roommate: ""Because you glare at me, and stomp, and slam the door. Wouldn't you be scared?""

Me: ""...What? but that's not a reason to say you feel unsafe. Saying you feel unsafe is a bold statement, and I don't believe you're scared.""

Her: ""That's because I told my parents about this and they told me not to act scared so I don't give you power.""

Me: ""I was stressed....?""

Her: \*slowly\* ""So it EVERY OTHER college student.""

Me: ""but you weren't friendly?""

Her: ""I offered you cookies and you blew me off!""

That night, I slept at my friend's house. After the semester ended, in the middle of Christmas break, I texted her saying I was sorry for making her uncomfortable in the room, but I felt she needed to hear my side of the story, too. I told her it bothered me that she implied I was dangerous and didn't talk to me about her issues first. I told her about some of the things she did that bothered me. I said I would try to follow the roommate agreement in the future, but I didn't want any drama next semester. She never responded.

The next semester I brought her oreos and apologized (I was really nervous) and said I wanted to start over.

She's like, ""Okay! But you need to check your mail more often. I worry about you!""

Me: ""Okay....did you get my text...?""

She says, ""Yeah...I was gonna say something, but...hahah I didn't want to.....sometimes I have trouble making friends because I lack social skills and I was panicking.""

I'm like, ""Really? Sometimes I'm kinda shy...idk if you noticed or not.""

Her: ""haha. Yeah. I've noticed.""

The beginning of the semester was better. I tried to make an effort to be more friendly even though it's out of my comfort zone. However, it felt like she took some digs at me sometimes.

For example, I got new professional theatre headshots. I asked her if she wanted to see them because I was trying to choose my favorites to send the photographer for editing.

Her: ""You want me to see?""

Me: ""Yeah! \*She comes over\* I show her a pic and said, ""I love this one!""

Her: ""hmmmm to edit that, I would edit out the red on your forehead and then sculpt your cheekbones, but idk what the acting industry likes.""

Another time I told her I was working a lot, so that's why she might not be seeing me in the room very much. She says,"" I don't have a job because my parents have good jobs and...I got scholarships for being smart..or at least, that's what my parents say. Haha.""

One time I was talking about my skin because I was preparing for an audition. She said,"" Let me see.""

Me: ""errr...noooo""

Her: ""Dont' worry I won't judge."" She got super close to me, which made me super uncomfortable because my skin is my biggest insecurity. She says, ""Oh you just have larger pores. \*She pats her face and smiles\* ""I have small ones.""

I pause and stare at her blankly, but I try to brush it off and continue the conversation.

There were other strange interactions, too, but I feel this post would be too long...(unless you want to hear the others)

LATER, I start talking to this guy. He basically told me that she was annoyed that he wanted to be friends with me and that she said, ""Idk why you'd want to be friends with her, but whatever."" He said he feels like she has a strong disdain for me.

I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt, but since he told me that, it led me to believe that she actually was taking a dig at me with her comments, and that it wasn't because of a ""lack of social skills."" I was a junior and she was a freshman and I felt that she had no respect for me. I will also say that I'm 4'11 and I've always been petite/little for my age. I've talked to many people about this, and they don't think I'm intimidating. Idk. Could she have found me intimidating? I'm still baffled about this. I kinda went off on her through text this summer because I thought what she did was hurtful. No response...

Honestly, the environment was really toxic for me. I tried to switch rooms, but the school wouldn't let anyone because some of the dorms were under renovation and had mold. I was really disturbed by the fact that she would say I made her feel unsafe. Couldn't that get someone in serious trouble? I know I could've been less moody, but I feel that slamming a door sometimes isn't a reason to report someone for making you feel ""unsafe.""",17Aug2019,1
76,"I‚Äôve had a pretty rough life. I never really felt loved or cared for while growing up. I was emotionally abused, left and lied to by mother and father, I‚Äôve been in 17 fights in and out of school. I fought for my brother because he was gay and I wanted him to be open about it and my mother because everyone in my school knew she was on the run from the cops and I would constantly be bullied. I‚Äôm 20 years old and have trust issues, bad anger issues, anxiety, and depression or had at least. I was dating this girl for about a year (Longest relationship) and she is the sweetest most caring person I‚Äôve ever had in my life and she made me feel loved for the first time in my life. I felt it in my heart. However do to said issues I was easily upset and never trusted her. I fucked up and lost her a week ago because I blew up when she was bad at communicating. It was the worst pain I‚Äôve had in my entire life. She texted me and said she still loves me and would like to see me in a couple weeks. For some reason I feel far different after losing her. I went grocery shopping by myself, to the movies by myself, to the mall by myself, cooked healthy for myself, got a gym membership and started writing music. I made up with my mom and brother who I cut off for years. I feel free and feel good. I don‚Äôt know what to call this and I can‚Äôt believe the quick change and character.

78,"In the dream I was going on some kind of camping trip with John. I don‚Äôt remember a ton of details, but after we had set up camp and were looking around the area, a bobcat jumped out in front of us on the trail and prepared to attack. I was afraid, but John protected me. Later, we drove into town and visited this really weird museum that had a spiral staircase extending so far up we couldn't see the top. There was a challenge posed to visitors to see who could reach the top‚Äìapparently, not many people had accomplished the task. John and I climbed for a while, but both got too tired to continue and came back down.

I've always wondered about this dream and what it could have meant in terms of our relationship. It makes me wonder if John was trying to manifest himself to me through the dream. I definitely feel an extremely strong pull to him that I can't explain. Most people are able to put their finger on why they're so obsessed with a celebrity. Maybe they really like their art, maybe they're sexually attracted to them. With me, it's something totally different. I adore his music and all his talents, but my love for him goes beyond that, and I can't quite explain why the connection feels so strong. It's something I don't understand at all, but I don't question it too much, because I figure there has to be a reason why our spirits are so intertwined.

I always imagine us in a type of father-daughter relationship, but more so like friends rather than actual biological relatives. I don't view him romantically, since I'm just a young girl and don't really feel that way about anybody, but I look up to him like an older friend or mentor.",17Aug2019,1

83,"I met this guy when we were both in freshman year. We have the same major so we've had a couple classes together. At first he seemed cool, easy to talk to, even if his sense of humor is a little cringey. He asked me out, and I tried to be as polite and straightforward as I could and turned him down. He acted like it was all good, disappointed but not upset.

But he has not stopped pursuing me. One time he literally asked if we could *pretend* to date. He talked about how lonely he is and how lonely I am (??? never told him I'm lonely) and we should just pretend and make ourselves happy for a while. Like wut. But I shut that down real quick, told him no way that's happening.

He's never come straight out and said ""we should have sex"" but he's always inviting me over to his empty dorm, constantly texting me about sex and what he likes, how he always takes care of the girl, saying we should shower together (""not to have sexy time but just because it'd be fun"", yeah okay, it's definitely not because you want to see me naked and show me your dick), etc. All of this with no prompting from me, I rarely text him back but he always brings up sex and masturbation. He's also asked for a picture of me in my underwear, although he did back off when I said no and has never asked again.

This year he's an RA in a separate building from mine. Last night he texted me saying ""wow you live on the top floor, that sucks"" (the building has no elevator). I was caught off guard and asked how he knew that, thinking maybe he just saw me climbing the stairs from a distance. But he told me he was looking at the roster and saw what room I'm in.

Dorm rosters definitely aren't public, no one can see them except if you're an RA. I don't know how exactly the roster works since I'm not one, but seeing as I'm in a different building it makes me uncomfortable knowing that he can see more than his own assigned building. And it really makes me uncomfortable that he knows where I live now.

He's never done anything creepy enough to warrant a report or anything like that. If I did try to report him right now, it wouldn't go anywhere anyway. And he's never been aggressive enough to warrant actual fear out of this situation, it's not like I think he's gonna come to my room and rape me or anything extreme like that.

I just don't like that fact that this guy, who constantly tries to have sex with me despite me telling him NO, very clearly on numerous occasions, knows where I live and *told* me so. It just feels weird, like ""haha I know where you are teehee"" and I *definitely* don't want him showing up at my door. I have roommates so I feel a little better knowing I'm not alone, but I just can't shake that icky feeling.",17Aug2019,2

95,"Am a picky eater. I hate most of the vegetables. I hate the ones I like too, if they aren't cooked the same way I have been eating all my life. 
I cannot grab a sandwich because they put lettuce, cabbage, some other leaves, zucchini, cucumber, capsicum etc etc. And once I remove everything, I am left with slices of tomatoes and onions. 
I can't buy cereal because it's hard to find a brand that doesn't put raisins in them, where I live. 
I can't drink anything other than water at any restaurant. The milk shakes are weird. The mojitos are bitter. Everything feels alien. 
Also, am a vegetarian. So I live on a handful of recipes. 
I enjoy a couple types of bread. But there is only white bread in the place I live. The things I get to eat are so limited and I wish I could enjoy more food that suits my palate.",17Aug2019,0
96,"I know this isn't a subreddit for relationship problems. I'm not here to seek advice. I just thought I might feel better if I put my feeling into words and put it out there. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so, so afraid that this is it for me and him and that our tumultuous relationship is coming to an end. When we first met, we used to think we were so compatible with each other. We didn't argue much, and even if we did, we were able to talk about it and move on. But I'm afraid that the window for reconciliation is closing in on us. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't recognize him anymore. I don't recognize this person who calls me all these horrible names and screams at me every time he gets angry. I'm not saying I'm perfect--I know I'm far from perfect. But I just never thought we'd end up in a place where he'd say that marrying me was the worst mistake of his life. I've said some hurtful things to him as well, but I have never said anything remotely close to that because in my heart of hearts, I don't think so, and I've never thought so. We've had really bad fights before--not quite as awful as the ones we've been having lately--but he'd always say he didn't mean what he said when he was angry. But after years of repeating the same pattern of behavior, I'm finding it harder and harder to believe that he loves me or cares about me at all. He may still have some love for me somewhere in his heart, but I'm not confident. And what hurts me the most is that he doesn't seem to care why I feel so hurt. I've sat down with him and we've discussed this many times, but he doesn't seem to be able to behave any differently. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just never thought I'd end up here, where it's so, so hard to keep fighting for a future with him. I'm really not sure what to do. As a last resort, we're looking to start marriage counseling, but I'm really afraid that we'll just call it quits before we can even get in the door. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've lurked around reddit long enough and read enough relationship posts to be able to guess what some people might say or think--but it's not that easy. It's just so hard to throw my hands up and give up on what I once thought was the best relationship of my life.",17Aug2019,5

104,"Hello Everyone,  
I'm hoping this is the right sub to post this question.

 I've been trying to focus on determining my 'values' or what's most important to me, so I can organize my life and daily activities around those. But it's been very difficult. Because when I try to do any exercise that helps me find them, I'm asked to observe what my default thoughts are or where I usually spend my money or how I usually spend my time. And the truth is that I'm shit scared of failing and proving to myself and everyone that my belief that I'm not good enough is actually true and I do anything and everything to protect myself from that. That's been my whole life. There's nothing productive that I can find by analyzing my patterns.

I actually have a very good job at 25. And I only got it by battling through interviews while coping with extreme anxiety and not really loving the field because I was scared of not meeting my family's and society's expectations. And through this process, I've had no choice but to introspect and accept some of the things mentioned above that I've been running from since a long time.  Now I just go to work and just do enough to not get fired, come back home and my escapist habits kick in. 

Is it possible to have core values and find them, if someone has been dealing with any trauma since childhood and all their habits are built around coping with it? How to separate the desires associated with the trauma from actual values? I'd greatly appreciate if anyone could provide useful suggestions.  


Thanks.",17Aug2019,2
105,"That's basically it, I have a lot to say about him but i think most of them go without saying by now. Just needed to get it out of my system because he's just such a gross person that I hate knowing how people think of him and ultimately they might associate him with Israel, which there's no denying that he advocates, but in no way represent. Really, he's just making this entire country look worse while blatantly spewing out hate. For real, fuck that guy",17Aug2019,76
106,"I'm so sick of every fucking boomer thinking that I can JUST go out of my way to get a job. To go out and socialize.

If it were that easy, I would be at like Kroger or Publix right now. All these same boomers are the ones hiring and they want you to have like 30 years of EXP at 27. Like really?

115,"\- On new year's eve, I sat alone and had no one to celebrate the new year with.

\- Two weeks after my 21st birthday, my girlfriend (was a long-distance relationship) of almost 4 years broke up with me.

\- Shortly after the breakup I went into a deep depression and had a horrible existential crisis. For some reason, it clicked that one day I'm going to die one day and I started questioning everything. 3 months later, it still hurts me.

\- My best friend was dealing with mental health problems, and after bottling up his feelings, decided to end our friendship. Towards the end, the relationship got really toxic because of his mental health. After that, I didn't have any ""real"" friends.

\- I keep on trying to ask my ""friends"" to hang out, but it's always me having to reach out to them. No one ever texts me and asks me to hang out. I have to do all the heavy lifting.

\- I can't count the number of times I have cried myself to sleep. In a very short amount of time, I lost my girlfriend and a best friend.

I don't really know what I'm expecting by writing this, but it's nice to get this out. Would love to hear if people have had similar struggles and what they have done to overcome them. Thank you for reading this, it really means the world. &lt;3",17Aug2019,1
