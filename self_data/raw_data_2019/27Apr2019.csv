Me and my manager stayed behind to get more work done, he could tell I wasn't feeling good. Truth be told I was feeling terrible, just felt like I can't handle things and that I should give up. He gave me a hug, and said ""I'll put some happy tunes on to cheer you up."" I almost cried, hit me right in the feels. Go back to my desk to find a cup of tea waiting for me. 

I'm still frustrated, stressed and just feeling empty but at least I'm not feeling any worse like I feared I would earlier today. That simple act made all the difference.",27Apr2019,1

6,"I’m 18f, for reference on how ridiculous this is.

I’ve slept with celebrities, been scouted by modelling agencies, been to my dream destinations, recovered from severe mental illness. I have my dream sex life. I have the best cat ever. I’ve already been successful with art and have had numerous pieces up in well-known events. I had some of my writing published when I was 16.

What the hell do I do now? I adore sticking around for my cat (*not implying anything suicidal—when I say I’m recovered I mean I’m recovered*) Hoping for a romantic relationship to happen is getting a bit tedious, and although I dream of it, it’s not very healthy to seek a partner just because I’m out of things to do with myself. Exercising is on my list but I’m already fairly content with my body and health. I have only one technical friend and I’m satisfied with that. But what am I meant to do when all my goals have already been met, and when I desire little more?

I often consider volunteering at a pet shelter to work with animals in need, but I have a phobia of larger dogs, and public transportation where I am is a bit out of my price range. Superficial and material stuff really piques my interest, but I don’t want a life like that.

Has anyone else experienced this? Or is anyone currently experiencing this?

12," [Aye she be a fine vessel for 568 000 USD](https://www.tradeboats.com.au/detail/custom-bay-class-246540) and it even comes with a crane which is helpful.

 [Take the compactor, the hydraulic arms, and the tip function](https://www.truckworld.com.au/used/trucks/6x4_garbage-compactors/iveco/acco-2350g/vic/2005/282820/?query=/trucks/a~garbage-compactors/&amp;f=v~1-z~15-) off of the truck and mount it to the boat, this component is another 62 000 USD. Now before you get all ""pfff it isn't that simple, it's way harder than that idiot"" actually yes it is that simple, it'll take some labour and some work - but it isn't that complicated, undo whatever bolts and whatever that hold the compactor and arms to the truck, then attach them to the structure of the ship. The ship may need some work, but it is already a mine hunting warship (in this example), the thing is from a garbage truck with 500 thousand kilometres on it. Connecting the two wouldn't be a feat of engineering - it could be done in less than 72 hours once the crew and equipment is together would be my bet.^(3)

&amp;#x200B;

Right so now we have created a garbage ship. I know you may be scoffing but what do we use to collect garbage on land, a garbage truck. What is the problem for transport? Too much volume. What does a garbage truck do? It compacts garbage to make transport more efficient. So why not do it on the ocean? Seriously, even if it completely fails and tips all the rubbish into the ocean - worst case scenario you know have as much garbage in the ocean as you had before. But compacting it for transport is important for the next part, which is preparing it for its 5000 km journey to where it'll be processed.

&amp;#x200B;

So, the problem we have here is that transporting a large amount of plastic waste 5000 miles is not worth the money.But plastic floats, so why not toss it back into the ocean as a block of compacted plastics? Some googling tells me the weight of compacted plastic is about  [197 kg per cubic meter when compacted by a truck such as described above.](http://www.wrap.org.uk/sites/files/wrap/Bulk%20Density%20Summary%20Report%20-%20Jan2010.pdf) That is about ten times as dense as it was before being compacted (loose mixed plastic is about 22 kg/m^(3)). The important part is that sea water has a density of 1029 kg/m^(3). Yes we can throw the compacted plastic back into the ocean and it will just float. Of course the blocks may disintegrate, but you could always melt the outer layer to make a hard shell, or maybe wrap it in something. My point being it is feasible to sail through these garbage patches, scooping up rubbish with a glorified colander attached to a dump truck before compacting that plastic into units for disposal later without the need to remove it then and there.

&amp;#x200B;

We now have a bunch of meter cubed (or whatever is the ideal size) units of plastic waste floating about. Each 197 kg block. Transport would be more economical aboard a container ship. A geared container ship is one that has a crane, and it quite reasonable to expect a feeder/feedermax type container ship to have a capacity of 1500 Twenty Foot Equivalent Units (TEU). Now  [1 TEU gives about 33.2 cubic metres of space or 25 000 kg of cargo capacity, whichever is smaller.](http://www.dsv.com/sea-freight/sea-container-description/dry-container) 33.2 x 197 kg works out to 6540 kg, call it 6.5 tonnes which is less than 25 tonnes. Based on that let's assume each ship collecting a load of plastic can carry 6.5 tonnes x 1500 = 9750 tonnes of reclaimed plastic. Two seconds of googling has informed me that  [4.8 to 12.7 million metric tonnes of plastic enter the ocean each year.](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6223/768) While  [UNESCO tells me that ""microplastics"" form when plastic waste breaks down, and this waste collects in ""gyres"" of which there are 5 in the world.](http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/ioc-oceans/focus-areas/rio-20-ocean/blueprint-for-the-future-we-want/marine-pollution/facts-and-figures-on-marine-pollution/)

&amp;#x200B;

The cynics among you will tell me that ""microplastics are the real devil"" and that filling one container ship would only remove 0.078% of the plastic entering the ocean each year. However, I say that there are 5 ""gyres"" which are natures way of creating an oceanic garbage dump full of clean plastic. It is at this point a limitless untapped resource, any non-plastics will either break down or sink - leaving floating fields of clean if a little salty plastic gold. We can just convert more old ships and garbage trucks at worst, if we want to be real gucci about it we can design something from the ground up.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, problem is ""where do you take the plastics which country will want them?"" I am going to tie my answer in to my rebuttal to anyone who says  [""check out groups like theoceancleanup they are already doing something like this.""](https://www.theoceancleanup.com/) The answer is Somalia, or Africa or any other poor coastal nation. Here is why, Somalia is  [not in a great state in terms of economy or employment or abundance for resources.](https://fortuneofafrica.com/somalia/unemployment-in-somalia/) That is why Somalia has a lot of pirates - they live off a massive shipping lane, live off the ocean and have no other way to get by. So, why not spend a pitiful amount of money on some equipment to meltdown and recycle plastic and set it up there, hire Somali crews since they already have a tough sea going nature for example? Ocean cleanup is working on a zero emissions, autonomous, GPS tracked solution - which is already back in port due to malfunctions apparently. I don't think we need more robots when there are unemployed humans, and I would hardly call it exploitation when their current options are try to hijack a freighter, join isis, or become a refugee. Moreover, do we need fancy new technology to do this job - when it might be possible to recycle old trucks and old ships for the job?

&amp;#x200B;

 [Here is an article about how we can recycle plastics in various ways but let me give you a tl;dr](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5278446/) it takes the plastics and it melts it into a goo and shapes the goo into whatever it dreams it can be and it is something new. To be completely honest I find it faintly ridiculous that we are so hung up on how to purify and efficiently rework these plastics, why not use them to make boats or life jackets? I mean even in the most dirty unrefined form it all still floats doesn't it? I am certain a use can be found, and technology can work it out.

Friday’s are his drinking kickball league nights. I hate Friday. It is absolutely my least favorite night of the week. It means either I’m going to go watch him play, and get screamed at afterward. Or I am going to stay home, start a fight because I’m not going, and I get to listen to him whine and sigh about it for the next week. 

This week I had a girls night, and I was in high spirits. It ended a bit early, so I headed home around the same time his first game would be ending (1/3 total games). 

He texted me saying it would be really nice if I made an appearance, that it would mean a lot to him, yadda yadda. So I caved and went. He didn’t seem that drunk over text so I figured I was in the clear, and if nothing else it’ll make him happy.

26,"Sorry for the bad formatting, I'm on mobile. When I was young, I never really had a plan for how my life was going to turn out. All I really knew was that I wanted to be financially stable, and that I wanted a family. And with where my life is right now, I'm starting to think that neither of those are attainable.
Let me start with some background. Growing up I had really bad social anxiety and depression. After my mom left my dad my depression spiked. I lost all motivation in school and basically stopped trying. In all honesty, if I had gotten help at that time I probably would've been fine. But my dad told me that mental illness wasn't real and I just had to live with it. I was seven. After that, I stopped trying when it came to school. I didn't see the point in turning in assignments. Then my dad developed a brain tumor. It was his 6th one. He had surgery and survived, but after that I basically had to take care of myself. My mom got remarried to a man who didn't like me. She stopped trying to be a mom at that point. I still saw her, but she wasn't really involved with my life for a while. As the years passed, my dad slowly started developing anger issues. He took them out on my sister and me by yelling at us constantly. That just made my depression worse and my self esteem drop. It was also around the time that I hit puberty so my self image dropped with it. I never developed a sense of style because I thought I wasn't attractive enough to need one. By the time I hit high school, I was barely passing my classes and spending all of my free time playing video games. Plus I had no friends. College wasn't even something I was considering. Through out high school I also asked out a number of girls. All but one said no. After that my esteem hit what I thought was rock bottom. 
Let's get to now. I am about to finish my third year of college. I have no major and I'm basically failing out. I don't want to be here anymore but I have nothing to fall back on. My family is broke now and they are blaming me for it because I'm in college (even though they paid for none of it.) I have no idea what I want to do with my life and if I don't figure it out within the next few months I'm probably going to end up homeless. 
I also still don't have a social life. I can't talk to people. When I do I freak them out because I'm awkward. I haven't been on a date in over a year because I have no idea how to meet people. Every time I find someone attractive, I get too anxious to act on it so I never even talk to them. What's the point if they will just say no and laugh at me? (It's happened many times before). So much for having a decent life I guess.",27Apr2019,7
27,"As the title says, my father past away. I am sort of a loner, and I don't really have people to talk to about this. I don't know why, but I really want to share these with someone.

When I was 14, my dad and I went for a joyride in a Porsche. He was driving like wild man through all the back roads. We stopped at a stop sign and he looked over at me and said ""I'll let you drive if you don't tell your mother"". We did a quick Chinese fire drill and then I was tearing down the road with my dad yelling ""faster"" while I was hootin' and hollering. We got to a long straight away and he yelled ""Fucking floor it!"", so I did. It was the most fun I've ever had, seeing my uptight, very reserved father totally cut loose was amazing, and no, we never told my mother.

My dad hated most ""kid"" places, but he broke down one day, and we went to Chuck'e'Cheese. As soon as we got there I saw a giant Power Rangers poster on the wall that was thousands of tickets but I wanted it so bad. My dad said we were going to win it, and he got so into the kiddie games. We were running around the game floor with buckets of tickets. He was never one to shell out money carelessly, but he bought us both hundreds of tokens, and we played for hours. I got my poster and my dad let me hang it up in our basement, where it stayed for years. 

I have so many more, but those two little glimpses of my father's fun side have stayed with me my entire life. He was a such a great man, and an excellent father. I just want other people to know how much fun we had, and enjoy these wonderful memories with me.",27Apr2019,1259

Anyway, I got a new job where there’s no people older than 28 and holy shit it’s so different having people my age there, I’m going to sound like an asshole now but bare with me.

As the days passed I started to notice “imperfections” in them, their makeup looked like the “not to do” picture that they showed online m, you know, blocky eyebrows, winged eyeliner that looked like a stick, smudged lipstick, etc. They also were fatter or just as fat as I was, I could see their belly and I could see their rolls. I saw that their hair was dry and overly dyed.

It made me feel so much better, i don’t have to fix every single thing that I’m insecure about, no one cares about those things but myself and I can’t keep trying to make myself perfect because I can’t, there’ll always be something to be insecure about and I just don’t want to stress about that anymore.

When I can breathe and the air is fresh really early in the morning when the birds are chirping and not a soul is outside or late at night, when I can go out and sit in silence - except for the sound of cars passing by. Or the train. I feel that way about the entire world right now and it's really really.. Nice.

When you have unprotected sex and you have a lot of sex and you cum inside me a baby will happen. I know that's how it works, but do you? 

So there is something growing inside me. Undeniably. I knew I was pregnant before those lines turned pink, like something inside me changed. I'm going to figure out how far along I am but fuck I am pregnant. Can't stop peeing. Eating literally everything in sight. 

Tonight I had seafood enchiladas with polenta sauce and beans and rice and an entire bowl of 8-layer bean dip meant to be eaten with chips. I gave into those separately but equally. Fuck FOOD IS SO GOOD. Swiss cheese with salt on it. Chocolate chip cookies. Dude. Ice cream. 

I can feel it in me even though it's so smoll. Feels so fucking weird. Now that I know I'm pregnant I'm giving myself so much grace. No wonder why I was so emotional. No wonder I had no energy. No wonder I've been such a light-weight and one edible sends me over the m🌚🌕n. I get it now.

The world is different now that I'm pregnant. This is a whole nother trip. What is important to the world isn't what's important to me any more. I feel like I finally understand my mom. I understand everything. I understand what she did what she did for me and why she put herself and us first. I need to desperately start doing that more. Nothing matters anyway but now that I'm pregnant I'm finding solace in the fact that.. I matter. Right now I have precious cargo but dude I'M PRECIOUS Cargo too! Why didn't I realize that before? I should be taking care of myself like I'm pregnant always. I should be eating. Peeing. Not drinking. Not smoking. I mean to an extent but like I need to put good things into myself. I feel like since this enormous burden has been put on me and in such a traumatic matter 

Fuck killing yourself. Fuck drunk driving. I matter. I like actually matter and I want to be here. No bad days! This is all a blessing. Even the mistakes. Life takes you where it wants you to go and this has been such a learning experience. Even though I have to undo my pregnancy in my own.. even THIS experience in life has been a blessing; I'm not sad it's over I'm just happy it happened. I feel that way about this too even though I do think i can blame myself for part of it but what's the point. We're here now. 

On one hand I think.. I should have had more self respect than to ever let him fuck me without a condom. Ever. I don't know why I instantly thought we were different. I have never let a man do that before. I'm not a cum dumpster. Nice fetish but actually I'm not an object. When I said I was too high on acid to fuck we shouldn't have. I shouldn't have said what I said but I'm not something you're just using to masturbate with. Sex is something deeper. Like god.. hot sex is connection and awareness of the other person and pleasing them because they're there and they want it. Lately I haven't wanted sex because I felt disassociate. I was missing information that I'm pregnant and now I feel at one with myself again. Sex with him was something deeper when it was that. I always thought I was infertile but then again no other man has made me cum the way he did before either and I have no idea if that has anything to do with it.

39,"As a bit of background I work at a convenience store on my colleges campus, we sell the typical products that any other store would sell. Up until recently I've enjoyed my job, classes lined up perfectly with my hours, my co-workers were really great people, and my job was fun. Then things rapidly changed. This year, like every other year, we began selling items in bulk to allow students to spend their funds on their student accounts, when this happens we receive cases upon cases of product that normally will either be stored in the stock room or on the store shelves. 

It wasn't until recently that things went awry. One by one my coworkers quit either because they were fed up with the recent leadership changes, or because they were graduating. This wouldn't have been a problem if I didn't work with them every shift. Before I would have two other workers with me at night to close the store, but now I only have one other person, the manager, who I'm oddly cool with. But for the past two weeks I arrive at work expecting the worst because we have crates stacked to the ceiling that are supposed to be taken care of before my shift even starts.

My job is supposed to consist of taking care of frozen stock, drinks, and dry stock, but when the bulk orders arrive there is no distinction between these items meaning that it is impossible to know which items had to be saved. Last week we had learned that the freezer had been completed untouched and nothing had been put away previously in the day, this meant that I had double the work. On top of that I had dry stock and the drink cooler to stock all by myself. I wouldn't mind as much if it wasn't for the fact that half of this work is intended to be done when the trucks of items arrive! 

This leads me to tonight. Much like last week nothing had been done, crates we're stacked, frozen items were in the back, and the cooler was 100% empty. I had more work than ever to complete still with no help despite me requesting assistance from management. To make matters worse we are now expected to fill out a closing log of different tasks we must complete during our shift, of which are impossible with the different items that I have to put away. Today was my tipping point, I'm not sure if I can work there again, and I definitely can't work on a truck day anymore, it shouldn't be my lone responsibility to handle the stores entire stock right?",27Apr2019,1

Good luck with lawschool..
So I have recently been dating this girl who've I found out to be unfaithful ( should've seen that shit coming after the barrage of red flags) and whose currently awaiting a reply on whether or not she'll get accepted into law school. This girl also happens to be a racist piece of shit and would constantly make biggotted or racists remarks about black people which I completely chose to disregard during our relationship, but which she would always text to me about. Not only this but she's currently a secretary at a law firm and constantly tells me stories of their extremely unethical and shady conduct. My plan is to write a de-recommendation letter to submit to her schools law school program possibly including evidence of her racists remarks.

43,"I am a reserved person and I am not very comfortable to talk about my stuff. Or what I do in my freetime, what I have eaten and stuff like that. What instead I realised it's how people talk about everything, from food, travelling and whatsoever so easily. 

Recently I have tried an online dating app, trying to talk to people and I noticed how much people like to say things about themselves. 

I have a diary, and a cursed notedbook (I named it in this way, because in that notebook I have written my personal dark thoughts and stuff) and have two close people I can really talk about things openly. 

But outside of this environment, I am totally an inept person socially. 

Also to give another stupid example, I struggle to put even a picture on whatsapp. (I stay pictureless). I don't have social media. I think I don't have anything excting to share, so why should I say something?

All ails fall on me, when I am far from her. At this hour, I crave nothing but her touch, and the sight of her face. I am in love, and lost to my many memories. There are no worries to be had, once we share one fate. I would drool, to hold her hand. In my agitation, I stumble and fail, to an epic level. Guard my manners, that I remain a fidel soul. I live through her, and nothing matters, but the sweet of her skin. Thank the lord that I am granted such trespassing. With a sigh, we are beyond the bounds. Holy dream, and crazy delirium. Nothing to be sure, but that I have thought about her. 

  

I shall keep thinking, and sinking, down to her very feet. She is my everything, she is the edge of me, and my most delicious harmony. I am rambling such a waste, that I doubt my pace. Yes I am pacing and pacing, all anticipating. I am a travesty, that I fail to transpose her beauty. Nothing but rambling, to being a disappointment. I tried my best, to reach her heavenly heights. I could be anything. We will join hands, to be more than me. Together, we might pay respects, to the pulp of her bust.

Basically, I followed a writing prompt in a book on writing I've been reading through recently. I liked the story enough to want to post it somewhere, but it was an erotic short story. So, I went to a site I occasionally enjoy reading through and submitted it there. Then I kinda forgot about it. 

Fast forward to tonight, and I remembered the story had been posted and I was wondering how it had been received. Truth be told, I expected it to be like everything else I've posted, a few views, maybe a stray comment or two essentially telling me not to quit my day job. 

Nope. A little over 7k views, 13 favorites, 6 (almost entirely positive) comments, and a 4.5/5 star rating after just under 300 votes. Oh, and 3 people followed me based solely on that story. Yeah, it's not much, but it's the best reaction I've received yet on anything I've done. It psyched me up and I wanted to tell someone, but I don't have anyone in my family or friend group I can tell. So I decided to make an alt that nobody in my would know about so I could post this here.

London - Roger Michell ""Notting Hill"" (1999)

Vienna - Richard Linklater ""Before Sunrise"" (1995)

Salzburg - Robert Wise ""The Sound Of Music"" (1965)

Paris - Richard Linklater ""Before Sunset"" (2004), Woody Allen ""Midnight in Paris"" (2011)

Especially in Paris, I hommage many scenes of ""Midnight in Paris"" by Woody Allen so you will love it till the end of my film.

So last week I watched [this](https://youtu.be/0sv16yAnN2g) and fell in love immediately. I tried to figure out what was that about and then it hit me: one of the huge goals of my life is to have a family.

It may sound cheesy, but it's what I want. My current family is broken (grandfather and mother, but father is away etc.) and I suffer my fair share of psychological abuse (don't feel for me, I dealt with it better as I got older).

Old people are telling me that it's ""impossible"" to raise a good family that it all happens ""out of nowhere"" and you are not prepared etc. Although I believe nothing is perfect, I can sure as hell do my part in making it the BEST I possibly can. And also my family makes bullshit, silly mistakes witg our younger people that I know I would never make.

I don't want anyone to go through this. Especially my kids. With them, I have an opportunity. To show them SO MUCH love I didn't even know. I would take a bullet for them.

No matter how many times I tell myself I am not going to cut my fringe three drinks into a night out anymore, I still find myself over the sink with a pair of craft scissors every two weeks. 

I’ve woken up and decided my box-dye black hair should be blonde. I’ve had moments where my eyebrows seemed dispensable and years where I regretted it.

I’ve booked people on holidays they didn’t know they were going on and I’ve broken bones believing that I had an innate, untapped talent for gymnastics which deserves to be known. 

Over time I've learned the first reaction isn't always the best one you could come up with. Maybe I used to think sincerity had a time limit but I know now there's nothing ""less-than"" about that taking two minutes or two hours to think something through.

And I've learned that good friends are the ideal antidote to being impulsive - people who will tell you immediately that you're going funny, like a dog who sniffs out seizures. I’ll call my seizure dog friend Helen for anonymity. 

(Helen is my go-to name because it reminds me of Helen Zass/Drew Barrymore in Charlies Angels and she’s amazing.) 

My gal friend Helen is vital to me because we're two totally different people and we can be friends without feeling like we're competing. 

(Maybe that happens in guy friendships too and I just haven't heard a lot about it, if it does I'd like to. Sure I'm aware of toxic masculinity but what about guys who feel as much friends as they are enemies?)

The older I get, the more I notice the weird undercurrent of rivalry and outward pressure clinging to female relationships. Who’s a better singer or who’s better at art grows arms and legs named ‘Marriage’ and ‘Babies’ that beat you silly with tension.

Even if you take no part in it and don't want it, you can still feel it. Especially if you're similar - which friends often are, duh. 

We're so different we don't care if anybody compares us because we don't compare ourselves. If we were emoji's I would be a coffin and she would be a sparkly flower. 

She isn’t trying to look for herself mirrored in the beliefs I hold or the music I listen to. When she looks at me, she sees me. The friendship that we’ve built is based on what we love about each other and not what we like about ourselves.

We communicate in a secret language of vague references and punctuate with eyebrow gestures. At least once every time we hang out we will say the same thing at the same time. 

We've even shown up somewhere in the same outfit and argued about who has to change, which is strange when we grew up as Barbie and Dracula. Most importantly/facetiouslty, we don’t have to partake in those ritual compliment-loops on a night out or under an Instagram picture.

When our worlds are turned upside down we facetime whenever, wherever like Shakira. Nine times out of ten, the text I was going to send has been deleted by the end of the call. Her face makes me feel better and we don't feed into one another's madness. Mainly because mine is totally different from hers. 

When I have to verbally explain crazy thoughts out loud to someone who I know won’t follow me down my rabbit hole, I realise myself how crazy what I'm saying actually is. Vice versa.

I know it sounds strange - something that is one of the most important parts of the human experience, something that most people go through, is something that I can’t understand, or feel like is always going to be out of reach. I’m 20 years old, and I’ve never had my first kiss, relationship, or lost my virginity. I’ve never met a guy I felt like I could potentially be in a relationship with. I’ve met many guys, had guy friends before, have had guys confess their feelings for me but I’ve never felt any deep connections with them.

Most of the people I know have been in a relationship before. So it feels weird being around people in relationships and seeing it all around you, yet you can never relate to it. I find the concept of touching and holding hands with someone, kissing, flirting, talking, laughing and spending time with them everyday, so strange. I want all of that yet I feel like I’m never going to get that.

I was quite upset to see the death of Stark right at the end of the film, but I feel like his death could have been avoided.

At first I though he could have just flown away with the stones and transferred them to hulks hand. As we saw, he is capable of taking the force of snapping his fingers, but Doctor Strange held up 1 finger to stark, obviously meaning this is the only outcome that they win. 

But then I wondered why Stark didn't just hold his hand out away from his face. There was a higher chance (I think) that he could have survived if he held the gauntlet away from his face because the damage to his arm would have been wayyyyyy less fatal than his head. 

I may be wrong and I have no idea how the gauntlet works, but I feel like his death may have been avoidable.

Also: I feel like they can bring Stark back somehow. Vision was brought back to life. Even though saving stark could change the future because time travel is a thing apparently, it wouldn't matter because everything they did when they went back in time changed the past, no why not just change the past again.

To top that, things between her and my dad are not good (my dad is also at fault but he keeps trying to make things better while she keeps provoking him) so that particularly affects me a lot.
At this point I should tell you all that in fact things aren’t that bad, in her life. It’s just that she has massive trust issues and a toxic personality, because of which she sees everything including nice deeds as personal attacks. I’ve tried and tried to help her by teaching her to stop overthinking and trying to get her to meditate with me but nothing works, and I’m at a breaking point now. Our arguments keep getting worse and she keeps threatening to leave me and my dad (who lives away most of the time but cuz of work) or just does anything to make us feel bad like not having lunch or stuff, and I just end up feeling bad all the time.

63,"A quick introduction about myself and why I am posting this here;
I am a Data Analyst and I am pretty great at spotting trends and picking winners. I have around 85% accuracy in my choices.
I have been trading in stocks for the better part of the last decade and yes, I have been pretty successful at it but it lacked that edge or the excitement why I got into it in the first place. 
I got introduced to sports betting and had been an avid better for almost 2 years. I have been betting almost all on soccer and have been 85% successful. I am very disciplined at it and have a Google sheet with all my 1782 bets so far and a very detailed breakdown of every one of them; team, league, home/away, reasoning for the bet, results and the learnings.
I have followed the age old adage of not putting all the eggs in one basket i.e. never bet all your money on one team, I actually bet the smallest amount possible on any outcome (sometimes as low as $0.20).
For me the winning mattered more than the amount. The thrill of an intense match and the outcome swinging my way is nothing like anything else.
I had started with $10 from 2016 and till date, I have not put in any more.
But, it was not all great so far. In stocks, if you win, you get 1.x times your investment and if not, you get 1/1.x times back. It's never as inefficient as sports betting although the principles of operation of both are the same. The frustration rose a few months back that a winning outcome has infinitely reduced returns compared to a losing one (1.x returns to 0). This is wrong mathematically.
Having this at the back of my mind, it's no longer fun for me to bet on sports.
I am quitting it.. and quitting with more money in my wallet than I had started.",27Apr2019,1

original askreddit comment

This will get buried, but I wanted to get it off my chest.

I'm currently going through a breakup of sorts, with a long time FWB/roommate. We weren't just fwb... for a long time, we did EVERYTHING together, and considered each other best friends. We might even have been in a relationship if we weren't both so fucked in the heads and stubborn. We talked about road trips, and buying properties, and just had the best conversations you could ever hope to have with anyone. We seemed to get each other on a very deep level.

I'm moving out, and I'm sad, because I eventually fell in love with him, and he does not love me. We had a long talk about it and everything a few nights ago. The fact that he does not reciprocate my feelings is fine. It is what it is.

Last night we get into the first and only fight we've ever had. I did admittedly scream some things at him that were low and dirty. He responded by smashing a bunch of my stuff. I yelled some more things at him as i grabbed my bag and walked out the door. 

He rushed me, tackling me in the front yard, I think fracturing my finger in the process, but definitely damaging it, choking me with both hands, and slamming my head into the ground while yelling at me ""you think I haven't killed people before?"", all the while mocking the fact that ""the bad things that have happened to me in my life weren't so bad in comparison, were they"" (...to this happening to me, I guess? I had had a couple drinks before this, and also obviously was a little distracted by getting the crap knocked out of me by a 6'4, 200+lb man. I'm a 5'4, 135lb woman.)

I'm scrambling to hit him in the junk, pinch his leg, grab my pocket knife, anything to get him to let go. 

Right before I was seriously worried I was going to black out, he let go. I ran to my car, and drove off. I came back an hour later, because I was honestly worried about my cat. He came home, he apologized, cleaned up the mess, and left to sleep in his car. 

This morning, we decided to coordinate it so that as we're in this move-out process, we dont see each other at all. We will figure something out about our safety deposit, I guess.

As I cried myself to sleep last night, I thought to myself ""I guess I was wrong about him.""

(Feel free to check my post history. I should have kept my new year's resolution about not being a pushover.)



""UPDATE""

My finger is definitely broken, and the fact that I have a large, prominent throat tattoo is the only reason people havent asked me why in god's name I have giant hand shaped bruises on my neck. 


We agreed to not see each other any more than necessary during the move. I had plans to hang out with some friends last night. 


The FWB started texting me, telling me he missed me, and that he'd spend the rest of his life trying to find someone who has great sex like we do. I have apparently ruined him for all other women, and he will never find anyone like me again.



I ran home. I fucked him. I went back to my friend's. I was going to crash on my friend's couch originally, but at the last minute decided to go back home again. We had sex 3 more times.



Today, I hate myself for it.


Maybe the self-loathing is what I deserve for going back last night.",27Apr2019,1

66,"Got back from a date a few days ago and I got hungry, and only place open at 10 PM was McDonald's. I don't like going to fast food places late at night because having to make that food near midnight for +10 people must be fucking tragic, but God I was hungry. This was the first time I've been to McDonald's in nearly a decade.

I never use the drive-thru (there were ~10 cars there anyway) and went inside. Cashier looked miserable so I got something simple and left. Food was ass but what did I expect?

Next time I woke up and went to get lunch for my sister, and that's when I realised my card was gone. I haven't touched my wallet since McDonald's last night. I checked *everywhere* -- my car, my room, my garage, everywhere. Then I remembered I never got my card back. 

I was too tired to go back to McDonald's midday on the busiest street in this town, so I just cancelled my card and am now waiting for a new one next week. 

Then I got a notification for a student conference with an online registration fee of 20 dollars. I'm just hoping I get a new card before then.",27Apr2019,1

68,"Unfortunately, psychological issues run in both sides of my family (uncle has been on antidepressants ever since I was 3 and grandpa has crippling agoraphobia). So these mental problems have manifested in me as intrusive thoughts. I can be having a normal day, say taking my baby sister for a dip in the pool and I'll think of drowning her. My brain forces me to imagine the scene in vivid and excruciating detail which is traumatizing to say the least. One of the worst cases I've had is where I've fantasized about raping and brutally torturing my best friend. For some reason, this particular thought turned into an obsession and I had trouble thinking about her in a normal way. I tried talking to some of our mutual friends to get some help. Big mistake. She (my best friend) read the chat and found out. Fast forward a week after she kept pressuring me to tell her (I had confided in her that one of my intrusive thoughts was about a friend and was turning into an obsession). I confessed and turns out I made her cry - still haven't forgiven myself for that. At the moment I am going to a psychiatrist and she has told that what I am having is class A intrusive thoughts so I feel a little validated in that. So far it's only been getting worse however. The thoughts are beginning to intrude (ironically) into my social life. I begin to have violent fantasies about many people I interact with. When they're intense enough, I appear to doze off as if lost in thought and I twitch. If the thought is particularly devilish, I'll breathe sporadically and frantically. People are beginning to catch on. The girl who sits next to me in class found out after I had to confess to her due to her seeing me twitching in class. However, she has been pretty helpful and is trying her best to comfort me; we've grown to be pretty good friends which I'm very thankful for. I feel very paranoid at times as I sometimes feel like I'm being watched when I'm having one of my - for lack of a better term - intrusive episodes. One thought that has recently tuned into an obsession is the fact that there is someone/something in the corner of my room that watches me as I sleep. Have definitely lost an ample amount of sleep thanks to that. I've also become very prone to mood swings as of late because the thoughts always seem to materialize out of nowhere and ruin my mood for a while (I'd say for about 30-45 mins on average but I've had some that lasted hours). I have no coping mechanisms to deal with this other than self harm but that also gives me a lot of stress as I find myself always lost in thought and making up scenarios about what would happen if my scars/cuts were found. Any help? Sorry for the essay btw",27Apr2019,2
69,"Hey guys, so I’m pretty chuffed with my life right now! I never thought I’d say those words, but there they are! 
I just wanted to let people know about the last 5 years of my life, just to show people that giving up isn’t the answer! 

TLDR, I was suicidal, met a girl, she helped me through thick and thin, now we’re happily married!


So, here goes nothing! 
2014, I moved countries to try and boost my confidence and force myself in to situations where I would have to work my way out of it on my own. It did and didn’t go as planned. I expected to find a job, get an apartment and live among newly made friends. 
Instead I was homeless, lived on trains and in train stations, I had a “job” that I could go to and work for food and tips behind a bar. My life was very dark, I was scarily unhealthy, drank too much free alcohol at “work” and had roughly 1 or 2 meals a week. I didn’t move back to my home country straight away because I was too proud and lied to everybody I knew, saying I was having a whale of a time. 

2015, January, I moved back to my home country. 
I arrived home and obviously couldn’t hide how badly I had been living life to my family, I was severely depressed, anxious and had no light in my life. I became suicidal. 
February, I met a girl who I instantly loved, she lit up my life and showed me that there was stuff worth living for. 

2016, I moved in with my girlfriend. I had been trying for the past year to get any job I could possibly do with next to no qualifications. I had a few part time and 0 hour contract jobs but I always ended up with nothing after a few weeks. I was very depressed, my only happiness coming from my girlfriend.  She always said “things will work out, keep trying”. I never believed her but always listened. 

2017, she took me travelling. 
I proposed. 
Her dad gave me a ring that he proposed to her mom with, she always loved the ring and I had no money, so I thought what better way to show how much I love her than to propose with her mother’s ring. 
I did it on the edge of the Grand Canyon, she said yes!! 
I got a job later that year, it really set me up for a while and I was so happy. 

2018, I got let go from my job. They didn’t need me due to a lack of work. 
I got kicked out of my home because I couldn’t pay for it and my fiancé had to live with her family. I slept in my car. Again, I seriously considered ending it all. I was in my car and had decided to drive off of a near by cliff. The next thing I knew, my fiancé was at the side of my car knocking on the window, asking to come in with a sleeping bag. We spooned each other all night on my back seats. 
That revived me. 

2019 we got married, I got a permanent job in the manufacturing industry and have been bringing in steady money. We are saving towards getting a mortgage on a house and have spoken about having children. 
Last week I was emailed by a huge company in the small community I live in. They want to hire me on a permanent basis on DOUBLE the salary I’m on now!! 
I will be bringing home enough to keep me and my wife safe and healthy on my wages alone! 

Through all of this, all of my minor misfortunes and depressive episodes, my wife has been working 12 hour shifts at the local hospital, doing extra hours and extra jobs just to keep us afloat. I am alive today because of this woman. She deserves the world. 
Now she can relax. And we can start our lives together properly. 

Sorry about the wall of text!

73,"I've thought that I like movies and stories and books that makes one cry because I'm wanting to cry and release stuff I've kept to my self for 3 years, maybe. And just now did I actually explore—not really the proper word to use, but whatever—why I'm drawn to it.
Since grade 7 I've been stressed over things that deals a lot with socializing, something that is hard for me to do especially when it's people that have ruined—strong word and not the proper one, maybe affected will do,—the beginning of my life's new chapter. I am a shy person. I lack confidence too. And confidence is something that i lack greatly and it took a great toll on me. 
I don't have that much many friends but ive got people i can rely on. I went through stuff in grade 8, grade 9 now and something happened during the early weeks,  which affected me so much I'm not the way i used to be.
And all these stuff ive went through i kept all my thoughts to my self, since grade 7. I think I'm about to explode and I'm probably gonna cause me depression. 
And perhaps that's why I want movies and stories that can make you cry because I want to release all these within me. 

I've got someone i can talk to about it but I'm aftaid that when grade 9 ends and we wont be classmates during grade 10 we'd drift apart. 
I've had a circle during grade 8, and we were a close bunch. And we kind of 'disbanded' after not being classmates in grade 9.

But really though, I just want to open up my self to her and release some weight, but I'd be vulnerable and I'm afraid of being hurt. 

During grade 9's early weeks a classmate got her 2k stolen and I was one of the suspects, but I was not in the place when the accident happened during the most probable time. And was only there in the place afterwards. But my friend, who was also suspected, cleaned herself. And so it fell to me. 

She and i were part of a circle called BS—blue shed, because we hang out in blue kiosk in our  campus ground—and we mostly gossip. They're my friends, i trusted them.

When they suspected me i expected them to confront mw about it. I trusted them so i waited.

Being the gossiping people that they are they just talked about it behind my back. And they were not good at hiding it. I stopped hanging out with them.

That was probably what affected me the most.

I thought that maybe by posting and sharing it here i can release some burden. But talking is the best way to do it. Personally. I do hope I'll have someone to talk to about it. I do have someone and i hope i can talk to her.

 Aren’t we always told that there’s a specific way to achieve a dream? 
For example, to become famous you need to go to auditions and get an agent... yeah maybe in the 90s (I remember, I was there lol)  but it’s not that way anymore. You can self promote on social media and if you work hard enough, you’ll achieve that goal! 

Same applies to any other dream. There are multiple ways to get to your dream. No one way is absolutely correct.

Luckily, we have the roof over our heads, and food isn’t a problem, but we still have to be very careful, and there are extra things that we can’t have (I.e. going out to eat all the time, cleaners for our house, brother had to give up piano lessons).  Being in college, I can’t work all the time, so I’m short on cash sometimes, and it’s hard asking my mom for $ because I know she can’t always give me a helping hand (we have some family money that’s meant for education but she has to dip into it sometimes for expenses).

Al that is pretty daunting when I look around and see all my friends whose families have that safety net and can have flashy/upkept homes, get nice dinners all the time, go on fancy vacations all the time, etc. Also my roommates don’t have to work and are set with spending money, so it’s hard when I have to go off to work every weekend and I see all my friends hanging out before I leave. I feel like I’m missing out on fostering those friendships. I’ve also had to miss out on many dinner plans and even spring break plans because I don’t have the money to join them. And when I do get paid, the good feeling of getting to do what I want doesn’t last long, as life is expensive.

Despite our financial situation, a lot is good. My family &amp; I are super close, I’ve found some great friends, and I’m at school doing what I love and have made great strides this year. But it’s easy for all of that to get masked when I think about how tough it is to make ends meet, and it’s even harder when everyone around you probably doesn’t ever need to think about the phrase ‘make ends meet.’  And I guess biologically speaking, those with more money are higher up on the hierarchy of our species.

But she was different, it took me almost a year and it just happened.
In the starting Love was like less and then it started growing, we were just polar opposite of each other and I loved her I really did. We had a lots of fights or maybe I wasn't good at handling the fights, but you see we loved each other so we resolved it every time. It started last year the starting of fights which will end it for sure. It was March, we resolved it in same month and then another fight big one in July and resolved it after a lot of efforts, then one again in sept just a week before our 3rd anniversary, I was coming home for that celebration for a day I love in another state. She didn't knew. We had a fight and we didn't resolved it, you see mostly my childhood I've seen my parents fight on silly things and that effected me and my sister a lot, so we didn't liked it.

97,"Granted... I'm 20 years old, work right now for 12.75 an hour (hopefully, soon to change), and don't exactly have all the finances to move out solo (as much as I want to). 

My mother is super controlling, and screams at myself, and my two younger siblings any chance she gets. Yesterday my girlfriend came over and we made food; I forgot about two pans we left in the sink after she had left and my mother went OFF. 

I've been wanting to move out, but with the new phone bill, car insurance, other monthly payments, college and rent, I just can't do it right now. I tried moving out with friends, but no one is dedicated enough (that I know) to take on the payments. 

All I do now is work, go to school, and work on my computer. I have another 3 years of school for another major. And I just honestly want out. 

I love my father and everything he does for me... but fuck, I need out. I feel hopeless. 

My girlfriend doesn't want to move out until next year, and I'm just unsure of life. Fucking sucks. 

Thanks for reading. 

tl;dr: hate life and living at home. Don't feel I can support myself financially. Mother makes me wanna blow my head off.",27Apr2019,3
98,"I work with various kids between preschool and high school.Here are some of the random things I experienced this past week:

- Preschool-aged little girl bursts into tears. We're talking FULL ON hyperventalating, red face, snot running, quivering lip. She's absolutely inconsolable. I try to get her to tell me what was wrong, but every time she tries to, she thinks about what happened all over again and it makes her cry even harder. Finally I find out that she's bawling her eyes out because her friend had said to her - ""you're arguing with me."" That's it. Nothing else.

- Socially awkward preschool boy. He wants to fit in and be included in the fun and games, but he doesn't really know how. He follows all the girls around way too closely and repeatedly asks if he can sit next to them. They normally say no, or just ignore him. Well, I arrange the seating one day, and put one of the little girls next to him. She wants to sit with her friends, but I was spreading the ""groups"" out to get them to interact with new people, so I said no. The boy finally has his chance to interact with one of the girls... Literally *all* he ever seemed to want! She turns to look at him, and this is what he decides to do with his moment in the sun: he looks her intensely in the eyes and in a monotone voice, he promptly states, ""I eat poop."" The little girl snapped her head back to look at me, and with a panicked expression (with heavy notes of disgust), she says ""I don't wanna sit here."" YOUR ONE CHANCE AND THAT'S WHAT YOU DID WITH IT?!😂

- A boy in first grade told me that I look like Cardi B. I am white and do not reassemble her. Lol. 

- Two separate kids guessed my age this week. One said he thinks I'm 1000. The other said I'm 14. 

These guys crack me up. Just wanted to share a few of the oddities I witness with the kids I work with. 💜",27Apr2019,2

101,"This is supposed to be my final year in college and my final grades wipl be released tomorrow but I feel like.....no...I KNOW that I failed a course due to a very stupid yet costly mistake in my final project.

I have been having night terrors constantly since the day I submitted that project (3 weeks) and its almost always the same dream.

I would open up the college website and the grades would appear on the screen telling me I failed the year. Then I would cry my eyes out while my Dad stares at me while constantly shaking his head in disapproval and my mom would cover her face and sob quietly. Then I would wake up.

My father works overseas and devouts every piece of his being to providing for the family as a result I dont get to see or talk to him except during holidays. He paid for my tuition this year since I couldnt cover it and it makes me feel EXTREMELY guilty that the money went to waste.

My mom on the other hand is living with us. For the last two years shes been telling me how excited she is about my graduation and how I will be the first of her kids to finally finish a post secondary program unlike any of my older siblings.

I went to my college yesterday and initiated a backup plan in case I was right about my grades but then I found out the program is completely full and the only way I could signup is by going on the waitlist (worst case scenario I will have to take a year off).

I understand the mistakes I made and after some reflection I came to terms with my failure but I dont know If I can forgive myself for disappointing my parents when they hear the news. The sheer thought of it terrifies me, its like this huge weight on my chest i cant get rid of.

I wake up feeling bad and I go to sleep feeling awful. I cant think of the last time I had positive thoughts or a good time. The subject is always at the tip of my tounge when im around my mom but Im too afraid of how she will react.",27Apr2019,1

104,"I don’t post here much, but goddamn I felt like getting this out. Ever since I was a kid I wanted to go to Tokyo, the place just looked so vibrant, the culture, amazing. My freshman year of high school I told myself, “fuck it, as a gift to myself, my senior year I’d go to Japan”. I don’t have much life experience, I’m just an 18 year old kid from New York, I’ve had some jobs, had a few minor emotional things in my life, but I’ve never done anything like this, shit I barely leave the city. I worked, left jobs, all in that time saved up money to make this happen, my parents very supportive of me. Around December I bought a ticket for April.

Last Friday, I left for the airport, my good friends came with me and dropped me off there. I remember waiting in line for security and looking back at my friends waving at me, I turned around again and they were gone and in that moment, I felt alone, but knew I was on my way to something great. Had a long flight but after a nearly 23 hour flight, I made it. 

Culture shock hit hard, I had expected some people to speak English but not many did(stupid americans) though many did, the small bit of Japanese I had with me helped in terms of trains and directions. I jumped on the train out of the airport and headed to my hotel. It took my definitely by surprise when I was the only foreigner on board(I’m clearly Hispanic lol). It was a super alienating experience but something about it felt comforting strangely. It was also when I got to my hotel that I realized I was completely alone and could do almost anything and everything I want, a new experience for me. 

The next few days involved me just dipping around Tokyo, shopping, eating, checking out ancient sites that took my breath away. It was riveting, it made me realize how much bigger the world really is for someone who’s never left the country. The culture shock had subsided for the most part and I was just having a good time honestly. A friend in the states saw through Instagram that I was there and set me up with his friends out there. My last night in Tokyo was spent drinking shit loads of Sake, skating through Shibuya with my new friends who I felt like I knew forever, and ending up at this underground bar where the bartender strictly played funk vinyls. I was sad to leave but very happy to come home, was craving a New York slice of pizza heavily.

Going home I realized I learnt a lot about myself in that time. I realized I had learned to be comfortable on my own and enjoying my own company, I always needed to be with someone, and was even a little embarrassed when I told people I was going to Japan on my own, but I really wouldn’t have wanted to have done it any other way. I’ve also been too hard on myself, I felt like I was a weak person emotionally, but now that I think about it, could a weak person really have travelled to a completely foreign country all on their own at this age? I see the Japanese work ethic, business men slumped on the trains, the tenacity that goes into it. Shit I recently quit my job a few months back simply because I didn’t like a few people there, looking back on it that was such a shit reason to leave. This trip has taught me that if I want something in this world, that I absolutely have to go out and get it. I hate bragging but I’m proud of myself, I’m proud of getting out of my shell, seeing something through till the end, and most importantly accomplishing a feat so large at such a young age, I haven’t even finished high school. I’m not perfect, I still get scolded about not doing my homework or forgetting to do dishes, but shit this trip has taught me being the best I can, or at least trying.

108,"we met in 2015. i was fresh out of my engagement with one of his bestfriends from highschool, and a raging heroin addict. he slung dope, and was a light/moderate dope smoker at the time. we instantly clicked, from the second we said hey to each other. he had this personality, and charisma that was unlike anyone i had ever encountered. his blue eyes and dark, smooth voice gave me strength and comfort. him hugging the shit out of me when i was sad, or mad. we played skyrim, talked about warhammer, binge watched movies, rode countless miles hitting licks and trappin' out... we did everything together... especially dope. 

i shot up my very first time ever trying hard drugs. he had only smoked and snorted when we met. and eventually it got to a point pretty early on in our friendship where he had told me he wanted to try the iv method... i told him and begged him to not be like me... please god, dont do like i do. and after alot of debate, i gave in and shot him up, cause i knew at the end of the day he was going to try it reguardless. atleast with me i knew he would be safe... i watched him in that moment become a fiend... a fiend like me. and from that moment on, our friendship spiraled out of control. we taught each other how to con and finesse our way thru. fueling our addictions, we eventually got locked up together. co-defendants in a felony case. 

after that, i started to try and clean my life up... we crossed paths a few times after i got out, but i eventually had to isolate myself from that lifestyle and the people in it him especially. i turned my back on him. though i always kept my ears out for him.. i hated myself, and assumed responsibility for his ever escalated behavior because. if it hadnt of been for being around me, he wouldnt have wanted to try shooting up to begin with. i set the stage for the rest of his life when i gave him the dope. and it was weird too. cause he hit me up a few days ago.... if i would have known, i would have told him i loved him.... and i was so sorry even though he had heard it a million times before. i wanted him to know i still meant it.... and i will always love him and remember the crazy times we had, and now... hes gone and i missed my chance. ill always regret that. 

i will never forget you, and please watch over me like i tried to do you... ill see you on the other side, sugar.  ill bring the tacos, you bring the butt touches. i love you.",27Apr2019,5

 And to be honest, I do have feelings for her. She’s amazing. Highly likely that it will never work out, but she got me caring about how I look.
Dont get me wrong, I care about how I look by combing my hair and clean clothes. But I realized I had no style. Im pretty plain.
 Not expecting this to turn her head. But I saw myself in a mirror with them on and this is the first time Ive felt comfortable with myself and proud of how I look.
And I did notice more looks from women at a bar. So I felt more confident.",27Apr2019,6

111,"I've been dealing with pretty severe pain in my neck for the past 14 years. I went to my doctor when it first started and he couldn't figure out what was wrong. I had X-rays, MRI'S, and CT Scans and he still couldn't figure it out. Over the years I saw multiple physical therapists and chiropractors and nothing helped. I ended up in the emergency room multiple times per year because the pain would be so bad only intense narcotics would touch it. In the summer of 2017 my husband and I moved to a new town when I was pregnant with our now 16 month old daughter. After giving giving birth and recovering I decided since I was in a new town with new doctors I would try again to figure out what was wrong with my neck. My GP referred me to a pain specialist. He did an MRI and discovered my C5-6 disc was degenerative and pushing on my nerves. Over the next several months we tried multiple different treatments including medication, medial branch blockers, and an epidural steroid injection but none of it worked so he referred me to a neurosurgeon. My surgery was yesterday. It's called C5-6 anterior arthroplasty. They removed my degenerative disc and replaced it with an artificial one. Apparently the disc was in worse shape than originally thought. It was severely degenerated, there were multiple bone spurs, and it was pushing against my nerves more than either doctor thought. So it's a good thing it was removed! My surgeon is confident I will be pain free in a month. Right now I am in A LOT of pain. I can't really move my neck, and it is extremely sore. It also hurts to swallow. Which is to be expected. I am frustrated though because before my surgery I informed them that I have a high tolerance for narcotics and I would need a stronger dose than normal. They seemed to acknowledge that but ended up sending me home with 50 tabs of 5mg oxycodone which for me is basically tylenol. And since it's the weekend I can't call and talk to the doctor about it until Monday. He also put in my discharge papers that I can't take my medication for my psoriatic arthritis until June 10th which I am absolutely not okay with. Without that medication my knees, ankles, elbows, and hips will be swollen, I won't be able to walk. I don't need that on top of the pain in my neck. Also, prior to my surgery I was told that I would not be able to lift more than 10 lbs for 2 weeks. That's fine, I've prepared for that. But they didn't tell me I can't bend or twist, so I was not prepared for that. I would have bought one of those grabby sticks. The discharge papers also say that I have those restrictions until June 5th which is not what we discussed prior to my surgery. I have a camping trip planned and paid for for memorial weekend and if the restriction per discharge paper is true then I can't go and I wouldn't have scheduled my surgery for before the camping trip had I known. But he had told me it was only two weeks and I only have two weeks worth of help. I am a stay at home mom to a 21 lbs 16 month old daughter. So if I can't lift her until June 5th that's a problem. I will be calling the surgeon on Monday to get this all sorted. In any case, even with the issues, I'm glad after 14 years of dealing with the pain I finally got it fixed.",27Apr2019,2
