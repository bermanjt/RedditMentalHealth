1,"  I go to appointments fortnightly with an employment advisor for the past month. I’m a 21 year old quiet guy who’s quiet and nervous and polite. She reminded me the 
interviews she chose me for that I had coming up and she subbed me for both of them (they get job opportunities) and she then talked upbeat and her voice also was upbeat (bubbly) she talked a little bit about it and then said ‘ok do you need interview clothes?' (THey provide vouchers for interview clothes) I replied politely (I’m very quiet) ‘yes, Iv got all that' and she said 'oh have you got all that?’ (upbeat as I said) I said yes then she went on to say 'ok well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes, (she moved her hands also while saying this accordingly) make sure you get a shave, make sure you cut your nails..make sure you do your hair up all nice and that.....(then she paused as she was facing her computer) ..'and make sure you put some aftershave on aswell, for the girls make sure it's mens' then burst out laughing, she’s never even smiled before (I just smiled along with it) I a young guy and she’d in her early 30s. Just really worried she thinks I'm Ugly and that I stink. I did need a shave which maybe why but I always showered as normal and was clean I just hadn’t shaved this once and had easy wear layabout clothes on :/ she also put in the email ‘please dress smartly’ underlined. But she also chose me for 2 interviews and didn’t say that anything about appearance at all the 2nd time",08Jun2019,1

It's like the cookie monster but it eats socks.

My house is clean. I have no pets. There are no mice in the place. I keep my girl at her own apartment. Nobody has a key except me.

Yet every month my socks decline by two or three pair.

I check the dryer carefully, they arent stuck in there.

So where do all the socks go..",08Jun2019,2
3,I had a doctor's appointment today to get some test results and I got some scary news and I'm just not taking it very well. I've had this weird little growth on me for a couple of months right near my lymph nodes and a specialist took a sample a couple days ago and today I find out that it's 'suspicious' and now I have to go to an OB GYN oncologist. A fucking cancer doctor. After having three cancer scares and needing to have my uterus removed because of it I can't even put into words how terrified I am. It just won't leave me alone. I've had three chunks of cancer cells removed and then my entire uterus and now this?,08Jun2019,11
4,"I’m not doing this to brag, I’m just really happy! So I’m in my last year of college rn and I have been wanting to get an iPad for a while to take notes and do art commissions on. So I made it a goal a few months ago and have been slowly saving up (I work part time at a McDonald’s) to get the one I want with the pencil and the Apple care. So finally today, they had the one I want on sale on amazon and I was able to order it. It’s coming tomorrow and I’m just so happy to have achieved this small goal! I was so patient and even though I had to use most of my saved up money to get some car repairs done a month ago, I finally got it!",08Jun2019,2
5,"Sorry reditters, this is my first time here, kindly beg for my wrong grammar because I'm not that good with this language.

To cut my story short, we've been for four years, and all these years the favor is always given to me. She's always there when I needed her, she doesn't leave and always coming back to me even I  messed up. I thought she will never leave me, but this time it's all screwed. Last few months I feel that she doesn't show any affection to me. I'm sorry to say this. I know it's wrong but I hacked one of her social media account and found out that this one guy gives her all the attention she needed. The truth slaps me so hard. This past few weeks I keep telling her that I can change for good to suite her. This is the old saying that we only realize the worth of one thing when it's already too late. I love her very much. But I'm not the type of person that can do and show it to public, we've been in so many places and most of my first experiences happened with her.


Until now, I keep on following her, i already know that every passing day, she's falling out of love. I always asked her if she still loves me and she doesn't say a word. I know that she don't love me no more because before, when I  ask her if she loves me even she doesn't say it verbally I can see herself happily and contented to me. I can see her whole world with me. But when I look into her eyes now, all I see is a plain void.


I just want to share my experience to warn all the guy and also girl redditors out there that if she/he did all to you, don't let her go and love her all of your heart. I just missed so many things and even I don't know you guys I don't want you to suffer on what I've been coming through right now. If you can do it today, then do it. Don't let her slip away and give all your best and always try to make a new move everyday so she/he doesn't have a reason to let you go also. 


I keep on staying on her right now, even I know that one day when I wake up, she will be gone. I don't want to feel her sad no more. Even I knew that this won't workout, I keep on loving her and showing that I can do things that
 I cannot do when she still loves me. I don't want to be selfish anymore. It hurts so much on my side, but even I know it's all over, I just keep on making happy memories with her that I can cherish and treasure when she leaves. I feel guilty with everything I do before. I know it's 
The end game but I will keep on holding on to someone that I know that will never hold back.


Don't waste time guys. If you have time just say you love her even out of nowhere. Please don't make the Same mistakes I did before. Sorry for the long story, but thanks cause I shared my stories that I cannot tell my friends cause I don't want them to build a bad image with her. She's a very good and smart girl, and I don't want to ruin her to everyone. I know its my fault and I can never bring back the time. So please. Don't waste time. Time is the single thing on this world that we can never ever get back. Don't let her sleep with a pain in her heart. Just fix your problems before she go to sleep. Thanks for reading guys. I don't want upvotes., I'm just sharing my experience that you should never ever do. Thank you.",08Jun2019,2
6,"You know how when you try to remember a dream it's always kind of fuzzy or blurry? Well, that's how I feel when I try to remember today.

Something just felt off. My main guess is the weather. It was foggy as hell today and the entire landscape in my city got cut in the middle, kinda like a gigantic, cloudy wall. I felt that grogginess that comes with very gray days, and I couldn't see the mountains I see every single time I come back from school. We watched Inception at school, which is an odd choice for a class, and all it did was reinforce my idea that I was dreaming.

Don't get me wrong, it's not like nothing happened today. I finally acknowledged (is that the right word to use?) a crush that I've been dealing with for a while now, but only passed off as attraction. It's not a very important event, but it means today wasn't entirely monotonous. *Something* happened.

I don't know why, but this has been bothering me since noon. I just can't shake the feeling that something isn't quite right, like today wasn't a real day.",08Jun2019,2
7,"I miss her everyday and I’ve tried to move on but nothing works. I lost someone close to me and I’ve tried distractions, filling the void by spending time with loved ones and trying to find someone new but I connected with her on a level I have never connected to anyone else and even if I feel like I’ve come to terms with my loss sometimes I just feel myself missing the little things all over again. So many things remind me of her. I just need you’re advice if you have any, what has helped you with loss and heartbreak?",08Jun2019,3
8,"Vent: I'm in a lot of debt. Of course, because of my own choices, priorities, living beyond means. Moved cross-country and started life over from scratch, which kicked off balances I couldn't immediately pay off with low paying jobs. Plus airfare 4-5x/yr to visit family, weddings, eating out, trying to eat well or partially organic (you get what you pay for - what am I supposed to do, promote longterm bad health by eating cheap snacks?) and having too many material interests in things like fashion, film, decorating my apartment so it feels nice and like my space. Job didn't pay enough to allow savings, nor offered benefits, so all of a sudden I was paying my own health insurance in addition to car costs-- an easy few hundred I never had to account for monthly before. I know this is just how it is -- I'm not saying I want to be invincible or that I deserve special treatment. I can congratulate myself for loving the city I'm in, being mindful about my good habits too, I don't pay for a gym membership, manicures, cigarettes, things like that. My rent isn't extremely high, less than some people I know. I know you can't be perfect but everything else adds up so it feels like it cancels out anything good I am doing? I think self-care and treating myself are a big coping priority, because if I can't make room for a bit of that fun then I'm not really being myself or letting myself enjoy life. Who am I without having sources of joy? What is money for other than for using it to see the world, understand parts of yourself, enjoy places and people and relationships? I'm just mad at myself for feeling stuck and paralyzed in debt, which could have been prevented by better life choices and smarter spending. I wish there was a quick fix or quick money but that's not realistic, it has to be slow strategy and balance to this, I know. I've been disappointed in myself, skipped dinner thinking about this for the past three hours. Will try to take positive action now to turn it around.",08Jun2019,1

20,"Hey humans, 

&amp;#x200B;

My name is P. I'm coming from lovely Europe, 4 years ago i did not speak any English and today  I write this from Santa Monica, CA.   


When i was little i spent quiet some time in hospital. Almost half of the age, till i was 10. That is going to scar people since basic developed skill was to use my beloved grandma to smuggle candies, book, magazines, all kind of salty staff  for everybody in the building though window where nobody could reach. Since than they took my organ out and i lived happily ever after.  


Until when you see all that misery around, that makes you wander about life. So i somehow got into secondary grammar school (that was prestigious at that time), graduated, went to study 5 year my engineer degree which I somehow manage to get without learning anything accept again, hustle. (i love that American word).   


During that time i helped start juice company, i helped organize conferences because i had friends who did that, and my mail income was from teaching guys how to get a girl. I was also helping same type of people for my friend and colleague who was DR. and senior consultant with personal and carrier coaching.

So remember this is still Europe, where there is no subscription TV, no peanut butter, no apple-watch, and most importantly, no freedom of information. Communism with European face.   


So as soon as finish technical major (work was 99% with people so far) I went to states as student for three months. Actually it was 4 since they give you visa to be there 3 months, work your ass off and than spend it all in American economy. With another month of travel and knowing the culture (or iPhone buying process, or whatever you don't have in Europe. )   


After 3 month successful carer as a housekeeper and dishwasher later as help to sou-chef I spent it all.   
I was in Charleston, NY, Chicago, DC, Philly, Boston, than again NY and than fly back to Europe.  


I was impressed, how many people is out there, how huge can city be, how people can be great, how huge volume it can be, how country can believe in itself... i knew already on the plane home i i want to come back.    


I did get job in company who help develop workforce to European countries (GB, Nederland, Ireland... basically English speaking countries) because my English (i didn't speak a word before) was better than English of other candidates. I quit it in two weeks and in month i went back to the states.   


Briefly what happened here. I start as helper in same kitchen, become chef, than left because my cousin married my boss and made my life hell. Than was a busser, become a server become a manager in other restaurant.   
In the mind-time got married because in my wife country was a war so there was a chance for asylum. I payed for process she helped me with her position in eyes of government. Than was got bad, their house got bombed (thanks Russians) and her mom felt down from window. She lost memory on level she couldn't remember her daughter. So she left country and i got stuck in bureaucratic glitch when case went to trash. Now i can do legally almost everything but i cant go home on the Christmas.   


Than i quit job because my boss was getting paranoid about me sleeping with his wife (trust me never happened or was intend to happen but he was going through heavy middle age crisis). I sold bike, car, borrowed money from friend and try to buy apartment to create passive income. Didn't work since my boss didn't confirm my work in his businesses for mentioned reason.   


I put money to market lost right away (1st missed earnings of Facebook since day 1 of the company) , than gain almost everything back than brought brother so see him after 3 months, did nothing just chill and travel with him, then i left to NY, stayed there see my friends from Europe on Christmas (first brought his wife already and second proposed in NY) and than i left to LA.   


Here i tried be in Culver city but Brazilian dude brought his mom, daughter and was planning on wife. So from 2 pps it was 4, i left and now i live in Santa Monica.   
I worked here as a manager in restaurant, and i drooped it because i didn't believed in privileged system for one girl what was there and instead of changed it they want me to cover. Before i had better job in Down Town as a barista where owner didn't pay me month and half of the work till this day. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is what to do now? I know i want live in California, but i know that on east south is cheaper. I don't have full papers because leaving of my ex wife (she was so nice and we got divorced before she left because i may need it in future). My credit cards eating me, i have 2 days as busser and 2 days as server shifts. I think i know how to invest #tastynation (only place i ever made serious money)  but im worth now -5k so im not going on market before debt is payed.   


I read, i learn, i explore i discover and i love it, knowing every day more, but i cant live. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- I love John Olivier, I love go to LA hidden spots and talk to people, I love being in Quentin Tarantino cinema and watch old movies, i love travels, and once i want make movie. I was raised as a 9-5 or 8-4 guy not ,,entrepreneur as everybody is today. I feel like it changes so quickly that i have hard time to catch up. I know more and more every day but it takes serious time on YouTube, all kind of skill and learning pages. How can i find some job where i can personally grow and what give me support to get my own place (salary has to be 3 times high of your rent, if you want to apply )classic LA phrase)  


Is that even possible or you really have to be entrepreneur to make living. If yes, please give me somebody money to start and i conquer world in 5 years, because I will just hire ppl who hire ppl and than work on common good. Eighter is in real-estate, web development, marketing, project management, production process, all kind of investment ..anything. WITH FREEDOM OF INFORMATION IS US YOU CAN DO ANYTHING, that is how i feel it. But there is no time to Learn Python, or Premiere-cc, or CRM. But there are people who know that skills and they seek for jobs. I would love to give it tot then unless...  
I barely make 2k month and 950 is rent so with three payments my resources are very limited. And i cant drive uber till October. So help me, i don't know whats next because i want to do everything.  


So i don't know, tell me whats next?  


PS: i hired resume writer yesterday

23,"Hell isn’t fire and brimstone. It’s the constant grey coldness that has replaced the warmth of your heart. It isn’t torture and heat, it’s the lack of feeling that you used to bask in. Nostalgia fades, and pain becomes a feeling that you’re accustomed to. 

I really wish I could feel a semblance of what I used to feel but now I just go through the motions for a moment of relief. 

There is no more joy in my life. Maybe tomorrow I’ll be content for more than a couple seconds again.",08Jun2019,17

Hey, Mikey, I wanna say that I really like you. Even though I never said anything and it may seem as if I don't care about you, but I do. I feel terrible that you're ex turned out to be the typical girl, but I feel horrible. I want to be there for you because I know you're the one. You always made me happy with your goofy jokes and you're carefree self. I love you from the bottom of my heart. When I think of someone who I want to be with for the rest of my life, I think of you. You're a great guy and I hope that you'll accept me. You're gorgeous and every part of you is magnificent. I wish I could take you in my arms and stop the flow of your tears. I wish I could inhale all your sorrows and lift the burden off of your chest. I didn't know how to say this to you, but I had to say it. I know that there is a good chance that you won't see this, but I'll tell you this in a little while. I hope that you heal and find peace from her. For I'll make you a prince and crown you as the king of my heart. I love you!",08Jun2019,5
26,"Throwaway because, although I’m jealous, I don’t want him to end up sabotaging him.

I’ve always loved movies, actors in particular fascinated me when I was a kid - it was the first and only job I ever wanted. I wanted to be Terminator, Jack Sparrow, James Bond and I vividly remember, when I was 6 or 7, begging my Mum to sign me up for a weekend acting school.   

I’m from a small town in Northern England and the only acting classes were in the next city over - about 20 miles away - and they were expensive, like rich kid expensive. My Mum saved for a year whilst I practiced my audition and, the next year, I actually got a place ... and that’s where it started. I went there until I was 15; when I was 12, I got my first agent and had my first ‘taste’, if you will, of the industry: tv episodes, commercials, stage shows  - man, I remember that time in my early teens, deciding that this was all I ever wanted to do and, at the time, that was pretty realistic - before my 17th birthday I had more IMDB credits than a lot of actors I know today. 

The next move was to go to London and try and get into drama school (acting university) because I really wanted to be the best I could possibly be, after a year of trying, at 19, I got accepted into one of the most prestigious drama schools in the UK and I set off to London. 

Fast forward three years, I graduate, I get a really good agent, and the future looks bright... well, it did. As many of you know, the acting industry is really tough and, despite my previous experience and training, I struggled to get into audition rooms and it ended up with me getting dropped by my agent and having to move back into my parents house. It sucked. I’m getting myself back up on my feet now, I’ve got a part-time job and I’m saving to get back to London and try again.

I have to admit, the past two years have induced quite a depression in me and I confided in my brother, I told him how low I was and how much the acting industry had really drained out of me. It was around this time he thought he may as well - for whatever reason - try his hand at it, too. 

My brother has lived a pretty charmed life, he’s good looking, smart, got a great job (and a valuable university degree), and, despite only being 22, had enough money to buy a small flat in the place we’re from. He’s never had an interest in acting or anything like that but, because he was bored, I guess, he asked me to help him get into “the game”. Which, since I wasn’t doing much, I did. Literally a week after he made the choice, without any prior acting training and no agent, he found an open audition for a super major Hollywood franchise looking for lead roles - I told him that this kind of thing is more of a PR move but he went to London anyway to audition... and he got it. His first ever audition, his first ever acting experience, his first ever time on camera and he fucking got it.

Two weeks later, he’s flying out to America and signing contracts, getting the biggest agents, meeting my idols, and now he’s suddenly filming this thing - I don’t know what to think. I haven’t had time to think, it’s been such a whirlwind. 

Now my family are angry at me because I’m not “supporting him” or that I don’t seem “happy for him” and, of course, I want to be. He’s in a blockbuster movie and I’m his fucking brother, man, I WANT to be proud and excited and all that but whenever I’m alone with my thoughts all I feel is immense jealousy. I’ve never felt this depressed before, I feel like such a clown, I’ve dedicated almost two decades of my life to this and he gets it all in a couple weeks - it doesn’t seem fair. And I get it, life isn’t fair, stop moping and get on with it... but how? Does anybody have any advice on how I can do this? Because I’m starting to back out of shifts at my job since whenever I’m working all I can think about is how my brother is filming with such and such whilst I’m back here serving customers. 

How can I be genuinely happy for him?",08Jun2019,1

28,"Just making it clear that I’m a white dude (22) and I’m just quite unsettled by the experience. My grandmother owns a petrol station/diner and I go down there to use the wifi to download stuff occasionally as well as sometimes working. Wasn’t working today but I was sat at a table with my laptop and I went to the bathroom and came back, and there was a guy sitting at my table on the other side. I jokingly said “oh are you joining me?” and he was like “haha yeah mate, got a nice spot” so I sat down and kept doing stuff on my laptop, asked how he was doing. He said he was good. He started talking about how he was from a town nearby but gets down here once a month (I think) to sell stuff? Anyway, he very randomly changes the subject and starts going on about the government and all that, various rants about his rights and whatnot. I pretty much zoned out cause you get that shit non stop from Australians coming into a petrol station out in the country. Then he starts to explain how the Muslim’s are pissing him off and how he hates that the government bends the rules for all of them “fuckin towel heads” so I was like okay wow. I didn’t say anything. I pretty much just nod my head and said “yep” now and then. But he’s also going on about gun laws and how he hates that he isn’t able to defend himself. Told me that if a Muslim came into his property he’d shoot immediately without hesitation. Then told me a story about how a health inspector came into his wife’s work and he pulled a gun on him and told him to fuck off, because he was black. The whole time he’s saying this shit he’s just laughing and eating. It was just such a disgusting experience and left me kinda stiff. I’m not sure if this is the kind of thing I’m meant to post here but yeah, it was very weird and dark. Don’t like meeting people like that. It’s horrible and unsettling. Disgusting. Ugh.",08Jun2019,6

I cry and I get so sad. My boyfriend helps me by holding me and just breathing with me but after I feel so completely weighed down about it. But the thing is I never feel depressed I’m genuinely a happy person, I have self conscious issues about my body and whether or not I’m like but I generally and happy but not mania happy.

32,"I am on mobile, please bare with me.

I am a 19 year old male, living in a small rural town here in Washington. There is not a whole lot of opportunity, or people, or anything. Thé dating scene is narrow and I don’t have a whole lot of friends. I recently got myself another minimum wage job, but it will be a little tiny bit under 80 hours for two weeks. (Deliberately dome because corporate.) These details will come into play further in.

So I have grown up pretty sheltered. My father is not religious, but my mother was raised as a Roman Catholic. How my mother was raised is kind of like how I was raised, but with a few differences and such. My father served in the military and he experienced a lot in life, and continues to work for the American Government. They both met here in Washington, same side and area might I add, and it’s where I have grown up.

So, here I am. I am nineteen, and I will be turning  twenty pretty soon. I asked a few of my best friends if they wanted to go to a big city with me on my birthday. They said they were down and I’m really excited for it! I don’t get to go to a lot of places with people, and I feel like I want to make great memories on my 20th birthday. I decided to tell my mom and dad about this. My father is indifferent about it, but he’s happy that I have plans to have fun. My mom on the other hand... She’s not confident in me driving all the way to this big city. She’s afraid of me driving down there, and she wants me to ride with my friends in their vehicles. One friend has a two seater véhicule and a motorcycle, and I don’t know if my other friend’s vehicle can handle long trips. My mom is always so afraid that I am going to die in a wreck, and she’s always afraid that I’m going to crash. It’s my 20th birthday and she is afraid I’m going to die on it and kill my friends on the way. It’s so irritating to see that my mom has no faith in me or my abilities to greater extents. I might add that I once applied for a job at a library going the same route to said city, and my mom absolutely lost her shit after I told her that I was going to drive on i395. She forced my dad to either drive me there, or send it over email. While email for this job was an option, I wanted to appear in person for a better impression. If my mom was more extreme about her fear, I would not have been able to go. How is she going to react when I move away from this small little town that doesn’t even show what the « real world » is? (I can’t experience all of my life here!) My father was proud that I found a job that I was interested in, and I asked him if I could drive down there. He said that I can, but I can’t tell mom that I drove. He wanted me to get experience with driving on the interstate in. (I’ve driven on it numerous times anyways, it isn’t as big of a deal as my mom makes it out to be. To her, she treats it like I’m going to some enemy territory in a war zone or something.) I told her that and I said “so you want me to enlist and serve, then get shot and die? The she said “you won’t get shot and die. There are no wars.” (Pfft. We’ve essentially been at war since America was founded.) I also really, really want a motorcycle. My mom said “absolutely not.” My dad never said no, but I am buying it and the classes with my own money and I am forbidden from keeping it on the property. My mom does not want me to ride on one or even touch one. She’s afraid I’m going to die. It pisses me off that she expresses her fears to such ludicrous and tremendous levels. It’s absolutely preposterous.

So my best friends are both dating each other. I also have friends who are in school and working in other places. I don’t get to see any of them at all anymore because they’re either with each other or are busy or something. I don’t get to hang out with them as much anymore, and I always feel incredibly bored and lonely. I have tried using Tinder and other dating services, but there is so little opportunity in my area. I ask my mom for opinions of me dating, and she said that she wants me to marry a nice, Catholic woman who I will marry and start a family with. My mom is absolutely against me dating someone who either smokes or has had sex or isn’t “pure” or whatever. When I was young, my mom said that I was going to date another Catholic and she will be very nice and stuff. I talked about it with her tonight, and she’s is dry irritated with me because I decided to expand my options and stuff. What if I don’t want to marry a virgin catholic? Might I add that there aren’t as many Catholics here in this town, let alone virgin ones? I told her that I wanted to date a woman who had a nice personality and made me happy. I don’t care about a girl’s political affiliations and religious preferences. It doesn’t really matter to me. My mom replied with “what if she’s a low income trailer trash person? What if she has an STD? What if she can’t help you with anything?” It doesn’t fucking matter if she is poor or depressed or whatever negative term you can find under the sun. If she makes me happy and I make her happy, what does it matter? Sure, I probably would not date a girl who smokes, and I wouldn’t have sex before marriage, but taking a nap together and kissing before marriage is forbidden?

I live in a higher-level middle class home. I have a nice computer and I can afford things. That’s all nice. The thing is, I’m unhappy with my life. Not the things I have, but life. I can’t feel joy. I always feel so lonely and she told me “try fixing it.” I have been trying to fix my problems and I have been trying to go out and meet people. I even got a job as a cashier where I talk to people. Sure, I am really introverted and shy around people, but I’m trying to work on it. It’s to the point where I have had suicidal thoughts and feelings. Whenever I’m alone and not talking to my friends, I can feel intense surges of my mind being brutal. I would get these surreal realizations of “this is my life. I’m living it.” No one is ever around me. No one is ever near me. It would get so bad to where I would go out and drive to no where, and still be bored. I would try doing new things, and I would still feel lonely and bored. At night, I would often cry myself to sleep or try cutting myself or something. I would wait until the entirety of my body goes numb and I cry harder, yet I can still feel the pain of that shard of glass. (It doesn’t make any sense.) I’m trying to lift my spirits. I want to go out with people and make friends. I want a relationship. All of my friends have it, and they’re happy. Even with their minimum wage jobs. I consider them to be extremely lucky, even if they do come from middle/lower income or any class home. I used to love myself immensely, but I let it all go.

I asked my mom a what if question. “What if I wanted to let a hypothetical girl sleep over?” My mom started bringing up marriage and stuff. She said that I am never allowed to sleep with another girl, regardless if I date her or not. I guess I’m not allowed to kiss anyone or hug anyone unless if I marry her. That wasn’t the point where I realized that I need to step away. It’s where I further realized how she wants me to live a high class life with some ultra-clean lover and pristine friends. It’s fucking unrealistic and it affected most of my life. My father butted in and he said that he didn’t care as long as I was safe and had fun. I even remember when I was 12 or something, maybe younger, I can’t remember exactly... My dad was telling me about relationships and stuff. He told me, and I somehow remember this, that “mom grew up in a religious house hold. She would freak out if she found out if I had sex before marriage at an older age. (Implying 16-20 or so.)” Then he talked about how I could be safe and all that stuff. I really like my dad’s approach on life and experiences.

I was recently camping out with some friends and such and there was drinking involved. I remember wanting to drink, but I couldn’t stop thinking about what my mom and dad wanted of me. I also couldn’t stop thinking about how illegal it was. After the trip, I was kind of reflecting about everything. “I can’t live life with what my mom and dad want. I need to experience things for myself.” I felt like I should have had that beer, and I should have eased up and had some fun. I feel like I should have just laid back for a bit. It was just me and my friends, no one else. I just didn’t drink it because I knew my parents wouldn’t like it. De facto, they didn’t even need to know.

I don’t know. I’m trying my best to get my shit together. I just don’t like how my mom pads my life with friggen foam and bubble wrap. Not literally, but it’s like me life is bulletproof and my mom is the extremist protector. Well, guess who dreamed of killing them selves and it was happy? I posted it as a comment on this account, but I never told my mom or any family. Suicide is a frequent thought and I just want to be happy again. I hate this sense of over protection and extreme coddling. I lack so much life experience and I really want to try and learn without my mom saying “wait for your dad’s day off, do it another day, yatta yatta.” I just don’t feel happy anymore.",08Jun2019,5

(and I'm not entirely sure if I'm using this sub correctly, please let me know)  


We had a class  ""Programming Smartphone Apps"" the teacher was a bit incompetent and  couldn't teach. Nobody understood what he was trying to say. After a few  weeks of doing anything but the topic of the class, I decided to make a  button. A simple button. It sounds easy, but we weren't though anything  about Java or Android Studio, and I didn't know where I could find good  online tutorials neither. So I went to work.  


A button. It was  there. I pressed it nothing happend. I randomly copied code from working  apps, until it did something. Then finally, the text changed when  pressing the button. It was an awesome moment. I added a counter to the  button. I rebuilt the app, and I pressed it. It changed to ""Clicked 1  times!"". Yes, I got something working. I clicked it again. ""Clicked 1  times!"". That shouldn't happen.  


After a few hours (at least 2), I  finally had a working clicker. I was so happy at that point. My seat  neighbor then suggested it changing the color when clicked. Or even  better cycle the color spectrum. My seat neighbor definitely wasn't a  girl, not at all. Obviously, which girl would like colors.  


After a  bit of googling I could generate random numbers, and combine them to a 3  Byte color. By pressing the button it showed a random number. Pressing  it again, another one. Not quite what she wanted, but colorful anyway.  But it didn't have a practical use. And that bothered me.  


Then it  came to my mind: hex codes. I renamed my app to Color Randomizer, added  in hexadecimal color codes, and boom, it had a practical use (sort of).  But that wasn't enough for me. With a bit of experience (or an a little  more competent teacher \*cough\*) everyone could do that. But I wanted to  stand out. It didn't have to be super complicated, but should still  require a bit more than the most basic skills.  


So I added  functionality in. Starting with something surprisingly easy: a copy  function. Then I wanted to go a little further: The spectrum cycling  from the beginning! It took ages to do. I don't know why but I couldn't  figure out how to do it. Then, finally, it was working. And last,  comparatively usefull, I added in a button to limit the color span the  Randomizer was selecting from.  


And that's the story of how I wrote my first app.",08Jun2019,3

37,"hello fellow redditors !! 

I've been feeling genuinely really happy lately and I just wanted to share somewhere so I hope you all will accept me :-) for context, I've been mad sad for a while, mostly because I've always struggled with my self-worth and confidence and my bf (22M) and I (22F) of 6.5 years had been long-distance for 4 of those years (college) and that strained our relationship a lot but we love each other so much and we always saw marriage in our future so we could never give up on  the relationship -- 

anyHOW we lately (since January) have had an epiphany in our relationship since we were both graduating and we will very soon be moving in together!! normally I would be a little concerned because we used to have stupid fights and still be very childish and have doubts since we have only dated each other but literally it's like we're a whole new relationship and we've both changed so much for the better. For example, we stopped picking fights with each other, respecting each other's feelings more, and having open communication about everything, I've honestly never felt closer to him in my life and he feels the exact same so it's literally heavenly. I've been having better days in general because of how good my relationship is with him and my confidence has skyrocketed -- he's always been my #1 fan but now I am also very confident in my abilities (I'm applying to med school this summer pray for me) 

our sex life (TMI) also has dramatically gotten better like wow oh wow I have never been more attracted to this man than I am now and we've both been open about our kinks and what we want to do to sexually which also has really brought us closer :-) 

I'm on a high right now and just wanted to put it into writing and I hope you all have a wonderful day &lt;3",08Jun2019,1
38,"So recently I’ve found myself with a very awkward sleep schedule. 

I stay up until daylight and then end up sleeping until early afternoon. I attribute it to my work schedule and the fact that I took this summer off from college. I usually work from 4ish to 11-1am but only a few days a week. 

I always wanna stay up and play video games or something after work and I guess that slowly progressed to basically being on a 3rd shift schedule. 

I usually wake up around 1 or 2pm and go to bed at 6 or 7 in the am. 

I feel like I’m missing out on all the day has to offer, like the beach and stuff. But I can’t seem to fall asleep any sooner, I just lay awake in bed. I’ve thought about just pulling a 24 hr and going to bed around the right time the next day because I’ll probably be exhausted.

45,"First time putting in words my 2019 experience, here we go. 

Janurary started off alright, first two weeks were pretty chilled out with work. However on the 18th, i was unfairly dismissed from work the boss had made up complete lies in order to terminate my job so he could replace me with his nephew. I decided to leave work by doing a burnout ( stupid decisions require stupid people ) 

I decided to engage with legal firms about getting paid my termination pay etc, after paying a nice amount of money the day finally came where i'd find out if the underdog would beat the boss. Turns out i lost, simply because they refused to acknowledge my assistance there and my lawyer couldn't do much from there. 

So now your boi is jobless, Feburary is pretty dark tensions between my partner and i are rising because no work and apparently i'm a total dick when i don't work. Also doesn't help anxiety and depression are adding to this mix, fast forward to March partner says we need a break at this point i'm a broken person my life is completely shit nowhere to live and no job. After asking around, i move in with a friend all is well until the police show up and ask for me. 

* Anon, you done a burnout in Janurary why are you like this? 
* Sir, i am guilty i was just angry and i was stupid. 
* You like court? 
* Nope, but i'm going there anyways. 

April comes and so does my birthday, i get a chocolate from room mate and partner. Nothing interesting happens this month. 

May is the big court day, i decide not to attend since my anxiety is through the roof like i might faint this is how nervous i was. I write my apology letter and explain how i am sorry and how i could have killed someone, judge says okay, don't do it again here is a $716 fine. All good no job, need a job to pay fine. STILL LOOKING FOR A JOB, WORST LUCK THIS YEAR. 

Fast forward to last week, i finally get a job super excited! Great people, money and hours i am so happy. I START ON THE 11TH OF JUNE!! Monday this week police pull me over and say "" Anon, why are you driving? You are suspended for a year "" what the duck? The judge forgot to tell me and put it on paper, so now i cannot do this job as it requires me to have a licence. My luck right? 

Pros of this year: 
* After months of my relationship failing, we found a new spark and we are doing pretty good despite the now distance. 
* Controlling my mental health by seeing psychologist and facing the real world with an open mind. 
* There is still nice people in this world. 

Cons of this year:
* I realised how much i really dislike people
* Having no licence sucks
* Having no job sucks 
* Boredom is not a persons best friend. 


I hope you guys have a laugh and enjoy my shitty luck this year, we aren't even halfway through and i'm done! But overall i don't want sympathy? I just want people to take my advice on one thing. 

Never do things out of aggression, no matter the circumstance. It'll eventually catch upto you and hunt you down until you submit.

51,"Not sure why I'm writing this tbh. Maybe cause I really wanted to talk to her about random stuff like we used to and ask abt her day and tell her about mine. Anyway here goes.

Broke up with my girlfriend of 3 months on Wednesday. She said she felt she couldn't commit and wasn't ready for a relationship. Plus she couldn't juggle her studies tgt with a relationship. Seeing me putting in so much effort and she couldn't she felt really bad. Plus her studies had made her loose feelings for me.

Honestly the first 2 days were really bad. I would really break down crying for no random reason. When something random reminded me of her, when I remembered when we were carefree and had no worries, when we would talk until 3am, not giving a hoot about our work the next day, when she'll laugh for 2minutes straight just cause of something I said. I'll rememeber her small habits and the small things she liked. It sucks. To have your world jusr suddenly ripped from you. And the worst part is that it wasn't my fault. It was hers cause she didn't want to commit and she didn't want to fight for the relationship, even though I was ready to do anything. I would stay up until 1 to talk to her about her exams and calm her down even tho that meant I'll be dead the next day ( I had to wake up at 5). I would wait an hr for her jsur so I could spend 15mins walking her home late at night. I'm not gonna lie. It really hurt even though we were together for 3 months. Maybe cause it was my first relationship, but I knew she meant more than anything to me, and it hurt it was one sided. Maybe cause I blamed myself. Even though she meant everything I still couldn't keep her, even though I tried my best. I felt useless. 

But I guess I'm writing this as an encouragement post? Today felt immensely better. I remembered and appretiated friends that tried to talk to me. They couldn't help much. Even my friend just putting a comforting hand on my shoulder already made me feel like crying. But they tried and for that I'm grateful. Im slowly understanding that it's best for us to be apart. Even tho I miss her so much it was logically the best decision. And she was really nice about the breakup, because we agreed to be friends. Honestly it'll be hard. Even now I'm feeljng sad cause I wanna tlak to her so much but I know I shouldn't because we aren't together anymore but it's getting better. I'm understanding it was no one's fault, I know I put in my best for her and if I couldn't do it then it really can't be helped. I can't control her emotions and the timing. We were doing different things and trying to settle out own issues. It was bad timing. It's really hard to accept. And I think about it alot but I am getting over her. I'm accepting the fact that this is the best for us.

To anyone going through a breakup, or any hard times in general. It'll be hard. It will hurt and no one can completely understand your situation. But just trust that time heals. Trust that time will allow you to get over it, and control your emotions. Talk to people. They may not offer constructive advice but for me it really helped. I understood my emotions and I guess I'm accepting it. I'm not gonna lie it will be hard. But you just gotta trust that it'll work out in the end. Life has a funny way of working out. 

Another thing is that while this has hurt me so much, I really don't regret it. I don't regret getting together with her even though it brought me pain in the end. I don't regret it because it was a privilege to love someone and care for them. We did love each other and the experiecne was really once in a lifetime. I really do miss her but I hope that one day I can smile about it. I can now but I cant help but smile sadly. I keep wishing that it ended better.

And yeah I guess I know why I'm writing this. I'm sharing with yall how I'm dealing with my first breakup. Though its hard but I think I'm doing good. No hate no guilt no blame. Just slow acceptance. And I hope its encouragement as well. No matter how your relationship ended, please don't end it in hate. Apepretiate it, look back and be glad for the experience. And I guess that is one of the most important steps for accepting that it's the end. Because in every single relationship there were good times and I'm hoping yall can rememeber those instead of the bad times. It's these good times that make life worth living :) 

I did say that I didn't cry today but as I write this I cant help but feel emotional. Breaking up wasn't a good decision but it was the best for us. I'm hoping me, and anyone out there get go through this. It's hard and feeling sad will be frequent. You question so much but really trust in fate. Trust that you'll feel better and trust that the future will be greater for you. The emotional me doesn't believe that tbh but the logical me knows its true. Stay strong everyone :)",08Jun2019,4

It’s this large room on the side of the house where my brothers and I had the freedom from our parents to turn it into a game room. We got posters framed up, a video game area set up, and I’m planning on adding more like a snack bar and shelving soon. However, we have barely even worked on it that much, and my youngest brother is already on his way to destroy it. 

My younger brother is pretty lazy. My parents practically coddle him and he gets almost everything he wants. He is just immature all around. So when he had a friend over the other night I’d assume he be mature enough to take care of the electronics (that my brothers and I share) and he clean up after himself. He didn’t do any of that. 

There’s crumbs all over the new sofa, wrappers and trash scattered everywhere, and he’s broken a lot of our PlayStation accessories like controllers and headsets. He even managed to break the actual PS4 to where now it won’t eject and insert discs. I have confronted my parents about this, but they don’t really help. They say “he didn’t mean to”. 

I’m just sick of this, he’s almost 15 and he acts like a 6th grader. I’ve decided I need to try and fix this since my parents clearly are not motivated enough to help me. 

If there is any advice y’all could give me that be greatly appreciated. My other bother and I are very desperate for any help at this point. Also I’m not trying to sound like a prick. I love my brother and would take a bullet for him, but like every human being there are some flaws that need to be worked on. 

TL;DR: We have a game room, youngest immature brother destroys it with trash and food everywhere, and has destroyed our ps4 stuff",08Jun2019,3

59,"I was always more of a fan of Android than iOS. Android is far from perfect, but the best we've currently got. I never liked Apple because of how restricted it is, with the App Store not allowing many kinds of useful apps (emulators, for example. Unless they're allowed now?), and not having alternative app stores (there used to be Cydia years ago, but it required jailbreaking, and iOS jailbreaking doesn't seem as popular as it used to be, I think). Also, iPhones are ridiculously expensive.

When I was at the store, and tried out the new iPhones (Xs Max, Xs, and XR), I was absolutely amazed at how they worked. I tried web browsing, navigating through various menus, browsing maps, and using some other apps, and I was absolutely stunned how fluid the whole experience was. Even across different apps, everything fit together perfectly, it was like a work of art.

None of the Android phones I tried got even close to that kind of experience. And I've tried all kinds of high end phones like Samsung S10+, and Huawei P30 Pro. Even inside a single app, things kept stuttering sometimes, and animations didn't quite fit with each other even if they were smooth. Out of all the Android phones I tried, I think the Huawei P30 Pro was the closest, but it was still really far from any of the iPhones.

I'm still not going to buy an iPhone. Like I said, they are all ridiculously expensive, even the cheapest iPhone XR. And their locked down OS means that some of the apps I use on Android probably don't have any good iPhone equivalents (Tachiyomi, for example). I'm also really excited for foldable phones, which so far are only Androids, and when eventually cheaper, mid-range foldables appear, I hope to be able to buy one. But if one day Apple makes the iPhone much more open, so that I could easily use the same apps (or equivalents) as on Android, I'll probably start saving money to get one.",08Jun2019,0
60,"I’ll try keep this as short as possible; I met a girl through my first job about 3 years back who I got along with well. We’d constantly talk on the job, started hanging out outside of work, and quickly became the best of friends. I started feeling something more towards her. She has a boyfriend. I spent the next year or so getting closer and closer with her, spending almost every other day together, but as we got closer I just fell for her more and more. It got to the point where, even though I knew I’d get shot down, and I knew I’d be an asshole for putting all this shit on her while she was in a relationship, I had to tell her how I felt. Predictably, she let me down easy, told me that while she is happy I told her, her boyfriend is her priority and she thought it best we cut contact.

So that was that for a few months. We eventually got back into contact cause she felt she needed me in her life, my feelings had become manageable, and while there was some initial awkwardness about it all, we were soon back to being friends. Fast forward a year until now and while we rarely hang out in person though, and while we talk all day over text, it feels like we’re both kind of trying to stay in each other’s lives while staying at arm’s length. 

That all happened over a year ago. In that time I’ve tried everything; got on dating apps to varying degrees of success, had some interest from girls I already knew, hit the gym, started reading more, studied hard, basically everything I could do better myself. And while I’m not the lovesick little puppy I was before i told her (I feel like if I hadn’t told her I’d still be stuck that way, it had to be done), i still catch myself thinking about what could have been a shit ton. It was always pretty obvious there was something between us, there’s been tons of moments that I won’t cover that have definitely almost crossed the boundary of friendship, although it’s never quite went there. 

My friends have asked often how things are going on with the whole situation, and while I tell everyone I’m completely over it, I don’t think that’s the truth. Am I obsessively thinking of a future with her, and neglecting other areas of my life just for the chance to hang out with her? No, but I think it’s obvious to everyone when I tell them that ‘we’re just friends’ that a part of me wishes it was something more. It feels like I’ve moved on for the most part to focus on other things, but there’s just a part of me that can’t quite let go.

In that year, while I’ve probably had more attention from girls than at any point before in my life, I never find myself feeling anything close to what I once felt for her with anyone. I can’t help but compare in the back of my head. I want nothing more than to just be friends with her and never want anything more from it, but it’s been a year now and I honestly feel pathetic for having not got her out of my system. I mentioned how we rarely hang out anymore, and that I can kinda control my feelings for her, but I’ve noticed that when we accidentally run into each other and maybe hang out for an hour or so, it almost sends me straight back to that place of being completely head over heels for her and wanting to be around her all the time. Talking through text is manageable, but in real life it’s like there’s some electricity in the air between us or something. We turn into a pair of stupid laughing school kids, it makes me feel on top of the world, completely and utterly content, and that’s why I can’t be around her too much, because that’s not controllable, the more we’re around each other the more I want to be  around her, and I think on some level she feels that vibe too, hence why we limit ourselves from seeing each other so much.

Anyway, my point is; how the fuck do I get over her? I’ve had a thing for her for basically two and a half years at this point, it’s been a year since she shot me down, and she’s still with her boyfriend (despite a few rough patches where she’s come to me for support). There’s no hope here of anything happening, and I know that, and I have definitely brought my feelings for her to manageable levels, but it feels like there’s always gonna be that part of me that wants more, and so I’m always gonna feel like a fucking idiot when it comes to her. We’re basically best friends, and I can’t bring myself to cut her off completely, there’s nobody in my life who even comes close to understanding me like she does. I just wish I could meet someone just as good, fall for them, and have this all be forgotten, but it’s been a year of really, fully trying for that, and I haven’t felt that spark with anyone like I did with her. I can focus on myself all I want, and I really have, but eventually it feels like it all just leads back to her, as much as I try to deny it to myself and anyone who asks.",08Jun2019,1

66,"I read somewhere from someone on this particular Reddit that the best way to avoid nihilism is to think about what you care about...

But how can I do that when all the things I care about are being destroyed by the very thing I dislike the most? I love prehensile-tailed porcupines and many different types of animal species, but how can I stay happy thinking about those things when we the human race are driving them extinct? I want to do it things for the environment and animals, but what do I do when just about every thing I can do for the environment and animals that isn't killing and destroying them is seen as evil? How can I care about things when Modern Man chooses the only thing you can care about?

I'm sorry, but aside from friends and family, I don't care about people. I often feel more sympathy towards a roadkill raccoon then I do for the hundreds of people who die in mass shootings a year. Even though I don't specifically wish death on most people or want to kill people, this is apparently enough to make you a horrible person. My problem is how humans as a species are rapidly becoming self-absorbed as a species.. environmentalism is evil, caring about animals is evil, but not doing things purely for selfish human convenience. I've actually seen people defend the Keystone XL pipeline because ""it will create jobs,"" and despite there being other, less hazardous ways of doing that, that makes it okay?

I can't even use media to escape. Most modern media is human absorbed just like our species is becoming. When I was a kid, we had games like Shining Force  and suikoden 2 where humans teamed up with all sorts of different creatures. Now nowadays, we get crap like Project X zone where God forbid any of the playable characters be anything that doesn't look human . People often wonder why I am so bitter towards the game hat in time? That is because out of all the new Platformers that were promised that year, Hatton time was not only the only one that starred a human and portrayed them as Gods golden miracle, but every other platformer either failed or got canceled.

I also hate how whenever I make a vent like this, I look for reasons to be happy in life, and see maybe it's not so bad? Maybe there are several animals that are actually making a comeback through ways other than hunting. Maybe there is a Hidden Gem in media with a huge diversity of protagonist characters. Maybe there is something to be happy about what...

But no. Instead, people often make me feel even worse by shoving hunting down my throat and acting like I'm a horrible person for my opinions. Let me tell you something about hunting. I don't like it, I really don't. But what I hate even more than the hunting itself is the common perception of it. If you hunt, you are automatically a noble human being. You can't possibly be doing it for selfish reasons, only Noble reasons. This is why I cannot wrap my mind around octopath Traveler, because out of all the characters, the only animal lover is the Hunter, the one character I feel shouldn't be an animal lover because I am sick of The Stereotype that Hunters are automatically noble people. Again, my biggest problem with it isn't the hunting, but how heavily it's been Anglicized and how it's basically replaced all other forms of animal saviorism.

I know there are good people on earth, but do I think we, as a species, are capable of great things for the planet? Honestly, no. A lot of times, when human Customs are criticized, people will often hide behind excuses like ""you are human, so your opinions are wrong"" or ""but animals are like that too, so it's wrong for us to use our vast intelligence to be better than they are by helping them.""

At times I feel alone. More often than not, people don't understand misanthropy, so they constantly demonize it. I just wish I had someone who could help me see the good in life, but too often, it's not easy to find.",08Jun2019,0

As part of the process I keep looking on his photo as reference while i draw. Looking at how shitty my piece was, I realized that he's getting older. I didn't really bother to see all the little details he had every time we talked. His hair was getting more gray, hairline receding, a little more wrinkle as he smiles, and everything else. I thought that in years he'll be gone. Every day I ask him about politics and science, culture, his day at work, how we as family collectively annoy mom and laugh about it. Sometimes when I'm eating in the middle of the night and everyone's asleep he wakes up and walks in on me gorging on food and laughs because I'm hungry again. He always kisses us on the cheek before they leave for work, and again when they get home. He always told us stories growing up. He makes lots of food and drinks, and taught me to draw and paint.

78,"I met my current girlfriend over Tinder about 5 months ago. We went on a date, she brought me back to her place, and then we got high and watched a movie before I made the first move and kissed her. Then, we went on a couple more dates, and eventually, we hooked up a couple of times. She asked me to be her girlfriend pretty soon after that, and I very happily said yes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've only ever had one girlfriend before her, but we never really did anything. So, my current girlfriend was my first. Like, ever. Thing is, I'm 20 years old, and since still being a virgin was something I felt really shy about, all I told her beforehand was that I was pretty inexperienced. I thought for sure she would realize I'd never done anything the second we went at it, but... nope. I guess being gay has its perks sometimes, because at least I already kind of knew my way around a vagina, lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now that we're in a committed relationship and have had sex multiple times, though... I don't know how or even IF I should bring it up. I love her and there's a part of me that wants her to know how significant she is to me in that way, but I also feel like it might have been a bit unfair of me to have her take my virginity without her knowing anything about it.

I'm sure she would react in a really sweet way, something like ""whaaaaaaaaat?"" with a big dumb smile on her face, but I still can't help but feel shy about it. Not ashamed, really, but... almost. And the longer I wait, the more I feel like the news would shock her. But then again, I don't necessarily feel like she NEEDS to know. Does she?

80," I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls who were there a few hours (only 2 of them are involved here) later in the night near closing it was quiet and the blonde girl skipped up stairs to the toilet kept looking back at me giggling looking back down the stairs at me , a while later I walked around the corner to where they were sitting and that blonde girl was looking at me and I didn’t look away for a few seconds and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say to her brunette friend 'that lad just been staring at me' in an excited whisper way. (They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

 another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away. (She was saying the weird girl liked me having a joke because these girls never knew I existed before this night and the weird girl wasn’t in third night) 


I then went back to finish cleaning the same table nearby and then the brunette girl said excuse me again twice and I looked then she asked politely but nervously pointing at me when asking  'can I ask you a serious question?'

I work at a grocery store and my store manager asked me if I'd like to paint a mural in the break room. Of course I said yes, and this would be my second mural (my first one was a year ago, also a break room mural at another store). 
I consider myself very amateur because I don't paint or draw nearly as much as I would like, but have always had an aptitude/talent for it. 
Last year's mural was a massive learning curve, and I used interior latex wall paints. I had to experiment so much with different shades, how pigments mixed, how to keep the paint wet long enough to blend how I wanted it to, painting and repainting, etc-- in short, I grew some chest hair from all the frustration (came out really great though). Acrylics have never been my go-to, I prefer oils. 
I'm hoping there are some more seasoned artists/muralists here who are willing to share their input! What medium(s) do you use? What are some handy tricks to know? Is oil or latex better for an indoor mural? Any and all advice appreciated, thank you :)",08Jun2019,3

84,I’m not smart. I failed out of university. I’m lazy. I’m broke. I’m always dependent on others. The only reason people are nice to me is because I’m “pretty.” I want to bang my head into the wall but the only thing stopping me is knowing that my face will look disfigured and then I’ll really have nothing.,08Jun2019,3

88,"I’m at a place surrounded with a bunch of super nice, amazing people and I can’t stop thinking about how much they hate me. I’m supposed to have a great time and work together with them. I’m constantly jumping from a super confident extrovert to an extreme introvert every day, and it happens from one second to an other. I spend all my free time I can, alone, I was literally hiding today and I’m afraid to show myself tomorrow. My therapist is 6000 miles away and I had my last session a month ago. I don’t know what I want from this sub, I jut can’t do this no more.",08Jun2019,6
89,"I used to have friends, but some left me and some I left. I never got an explanation from my ex-friends, but they created new identities with new friends and I imagine I didn't fit. I left friends because they didn't reciprocate support, or because boyfriends isolated me. 

Right now I'm struggling a little bit with myself. 

I was dating a guy (28F/36M) for couple of years, then put my foot down on kids/marriage/etc and came home to find he was gone. 

When we met I explained all of my issues, including sex. I didn't want to lead him in blindly. I thought I might be asexual/LL/I had a lot of trauma. He wasn't bothered; insisted he'd fix it. 

I saw a therapist to fix myself and - with his patience too - regained a libido that's more normal (from like 1/year to 5/month). But he'd created this list of faults I needed to fix and by then I felt like I was never good enough. It bothered me because I didn't pick him apart like that. 

After he left we broke up for 6 months. I bought the house like I tried to while with him (he wouldn't do it). It was cheap and run down because that's all I could afford; mortgage repayments are half of rent costs. 

I had to admit I couldn't fix it. Not alone. I needed him to come back; construction was his industry and he was qualified and capable of fixing this. 

He never stopped texting when he left, so I showed him some tiny jobs that bothered me most. He came almost immediately; a 10 hour trip. He found problems in the house that building reports should have shown (but didn't) and could have killed me. He's fixing them. 

It's been a few months and he hasn't left. He says he won't until the job is done. Meanwhile he insisted he loved me, merged my name onto his documents (eg. Insurance), insisted on giving me his bank card so he has no access to funds. 

It's easier to comply and go along with a relationship; I do care about him and I hate that sad face when he thinks I don't. So I'm letting it happen. 

When he first reappeared though, I warned him that I'd been on lesbian apps/etc, I'm attracted to women, I might be gay. He refuses to accept it. He says it's just a choice I'm making, that I'm just overexposed to gay media and need to stop looking at it, if I was gay I'd know already, I can't be gay because I liked sex with him, etc. I said he was being homophobic and he said he's not homophobic, if he was homophobic he'd be in Kings Cross bashing their heads in and he isn't so he's not homophobic. I nearly threw up at that; it was like a different person... I keep trying to say ""what if I am gay"" and he keeps pushing me to shut up and stay. He's happy. I don't know that I am. 

Last year I wanted to settle into marriage and kids. Then he left. I realised maybe I'll never feel true passion because he is a he. But before I could get all the way out, I needed to be rescued and now I feel like I owe him for coming here. Even though I warned him, he'd spiral if this ends. So I'm stuck in the closet. 

If there is one! Jesus what if I try women and hate it. 

I do love him and he does care for me deeply. Isn't best-friend-with-sex the goal? I don't know... 

I need a friend",08Jun2019,5
90,"I’ve been doing a lot better recently, new job, gaining weight, simple things. But lately I’ve had a lot of people telling me I look better, happier, and more in control.

99,"I am on a lungfucking spree right now.

Today I took a 89 diesel ford pickup truck for a test drive.

I was out in the country so I didn’t have to drive far to find a quiet place to park it.

The exhaust was on the right side. It wasn’t very smokey but it was super potent.

It had that super rich classic diesel truck smell and flavor.

I got down on my knees next to the exhaust as it idled and put my face right up to it. I had to close my eyes because the exhaust was so strong my eyes were burning and watering.

I inhaled the toxic pollution deep into my lungs over and over and over again. I took a gigantic deep breath inches from the tailpipe and held it in for as long as I could.

Of course by now I’m getting dizzy so I took a good fresh air break then got right back into the plume of rich fresh diesel truck exhaust and marinated my lungs in it again.

On my way back home I smoked a lot of cigarettes letting the tar mix with the diesel soot deep inside my lungs.

After showing I crushed up some more granite pebbles and inhaled the silica dust.

It was a dark day for my lungs. I might be able to stop now knowing I put enough particulate matter into my lungs to last a shortened lifetime of slow suffocation.

I love the taste of lung damage.",08Jun2019,0
102,"So im pretty fucked up on everything but i want to know how some couples talk everyday and not run out of things to talk about...

What do people talk about? And how couples never run out of things to say? Like what they say when they meet day after day after day? 

I talk to girls online for one day. I ask questions about them it feels like im giving interview..

my questions are boring and i dont know how to be interested in them or idk how to ask open minded questions

Like if i get on my first date.. which i never done.. what do i say to her ? ""Hello"" ""hru"" ""where u from"" ""how old you"" 

i run out of questions to ask and convos over and other people will never text or ask questions first.

Im always the one that asks questions.. its never ppl who do that..

My convos are always tedious and people never put any effort into me.. or like me or love me. Im not important to anyone.
Girls never loved me. They always give one word replies that are very blunt. No enthuastic in it.

im too generic and im a ""Niceguy"" i fucking my self so fucking much. I have no personality. Im not cool or funny or intelligent or charismatic.. im just a stupid fucking loser with no job or friends. And i chase people and their approval just to be my friend.

And i use porn and girls to give me atttention so i feel good about my self and forget my problems.",08Jun2019,6
103,"I write her long texts before sleep, buy her flowers every once in a while, every time I take a good look at her I tell her she's beautiful. I start feeling like I'm taken for granted. Like I'm a fan of hers. Confronted her about it, says I need to tone it down then. Like fuck off, I literally have to stop myself from showing her love or else I'm gonna be viewed as a tool. She started to become the man of the relationship because I let her get onto my head too much I think. I absolutely can't say no when she wants to eat out, can't wake her up when she's sleeping on my shoulder and we have to go because I just love her so much. Point is, I may not be assertive enough in the relationship. I start to feel like someone who doesn't give a fuck will come and snatch her one day because of fucking biology. Can't tone my feelings towards her down and I fucking hate this, I'd move mountains for her",08Jun2019,7
