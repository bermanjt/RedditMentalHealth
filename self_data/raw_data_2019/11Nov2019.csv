0,"I already know and have been diagnosed with bipolar medication. Long story short I‚Äôve been battling insurance to cover my insanely unaffordable medication, while being supplied with sample packs by my psychiatrist.
Lost my insurance, ran out of samples, so I‚Äôve been off meds for a while now. 
Today I haven‚Äôt been able to move. Petting the dog is exhausting, rolling over isn‚Äôt worth the energy, typing this is overwhelming. 
I can‚Äôt sleep, just mindlessly watching television while thousands of thoughts swarm my mind.
I wouldn‚Äôt kill myself, I could never do that to my mom. I just wish someone would kill me. 
I know what I‚Äôm going through, I‚Äôve had this spell throughout the years. I‚Äôve put myself in countless dangerous situations when I act out on the desire to be murdered. 
But today, I just feel so alone in the world, and I‚Äôm so so physically exhausted. It‚Äôs not fair that I have to live in this world with expectations that seem impossible to meet.
Tomorrow I‚Äôm expected to be in a university class where the professor puts us into group discussions. Tonight I need to do my homework. 
School, work, endless deadlines and expectations. I don‚Äôt understand how other people do it, or do even way more than me.

4,"This is a little long, sorry in advance.


For a while, I've been visiting the subreddit r/MakeNewFriendsHere every now and then to both post and reply to posts in hopes of meeting a new friend. Over a few years of trying occasionally I still had absolutely no luck. I stopped going there for a while and just saw some posts on my front page from time to time, but I stopped actively using it.

That was until a little over six months ago when I tried posting for the first time in a while. I was feeling especially lonely and down and figured it was worth a shot, but I didn't have high hopes and probably would've stopped using the sub if I was unsuccessful again.

So I made a post talking about my situation and hoped for the best. I only got a few replies, and I tried messaging those who replied but they quickly either ghosted me or it just didn't work out so we stopped. None of the conversations went beyond a few messages like usual, except one.

It was from a girl in Michigan (I'm in New York) in a very similar situation to me, like almost exactly the same. As I read her first message, I was excited because it seemed like we would really get each other and I thought this would actually go somewhere. She ended her first message with something along the lines of ""If you ever need anything, I am always here, I promise :)"". That last sentence sealed the deal for me for some reason, like I just knew she was special and that I had finally found the friend I had hoped to find.

We messaged for a few weeks, eagerly awaiting each other's messages and learning a lot about each other. We talked about our emotions and experiences with anxiety, our similar interests in games, how her birthday was a day before mine. Everything was going so well. Eventually we began chatting on Snapchat and SMS.

Then on the Fourth of July, we actually talked for the first time. We have since talked almost every day for hours and told each other literally everything about ourselves. Not too long after we started talking, we both realized we had stronger feelings for each other. I remember her telling me once in a conversation about relationships, and how I had never been in one, to just be myself and one day a girl would fall for me. A few weeks later, she reminded me about that and said it worked, that she had fallen for me. And I had fallen for her. Everything went so fast, but it didn't matter to us. We knew what we felt and were both the happiest we had been in a long, long time. 

Well since then, we've just been talking about our future together and planning for it, how we want to move in together soon. She flew here on Halloween to finally visit, and I will never forget seeing her at the airport for the first time. Though I kind of messed up our first hug and almost knocked us both over! We're currently snuggled up on the couch watching South Park as I type this. The days I've spent with her have been by far the best of my life, everything we felt for each other before is only stronger now and I'm beyond excited for the future. She is absolutely perfect and everything I've ever hoped for in a partner and I cannot wait to live my life with her.

10,"This happens to me at work and in public. Like when I am at work and I see a customer or customers, I'll say ""Hi"" to them and they'll ignore me. Sometimes when I smile at a customer they don't smile back. It irritates me when people do this. When my coworkers and manager see this, it's embarrassing.

Even when I am walking down the street or down a hallway at work and a passerby is coming in my direction, I make eye contact, smile, and say ""hello"" to them and they just look at me and don't respond.

Even a couple of my neighbors. I remember one time when I went out to take the trash out and I saw my neighbor across the street. He was sitting on his porch and he was looking at me taking the trash out. I decided to wave at him and he didn't wave back. It was embarrassing because other neighbors were out watching.

16,"Earlier today I was looking at this one place (may be moving in the future) and ended up in a narrow dead end. I slowed down and suddenly this black and white cat walk RIGHT in front of my car. Because I had seen him cross I was able to hit my breaks before I hit him, but I still let out a little yell cuz holy shit I almost hit a kitty! 

So I'm sitting there watching the other side expectantly, looking for the cat to cross. And I do NOT see him. And I wait. And wait. And figure damn, if he's there, he's standing directly in front of my car or crawled under. So I'm like ok...Plan B. I put the car in park, took out the keys, open the door, go around... and sure enough there's this adorable little fraudster standing right up against my bumper just staring at me like he'd been waiting!

He was obviously VERY pleased that he had gotten someone's attention. Either that or he realized his insurance scam didn't work and decided to put on the charm. I have to say I did a bad thing and pet him a bunch and he was so very happy and cute. I know I should have scared him or something, to teach him not to run in front of cars. But my little indoor rabbit died a few months ago and I miss having an animal so much. And I've been having an awful week. So I did it, I gave in and pet him, and he was so cute and friendly. Then I walked him over to the side of the little road and got back in the car. 

As soon as I was back in someone opened the door of a house, the cat saw, and he ran right towards the person in the doorway. So I guess he was just coming home after a morning stroll. He was extremely cute and friendly but his dealings are a little dangerous. I'm glad he lives at a quiet dead-end street and feel fortunate I was only extorted for petting.",11Nov2019,1

19,"The title sums it up, but I'll do my best to elaborate. This is rather hard for me to admit and discuss, so please be gentle with me. I don't know where it comes from, or why it's so deeply ingrained even into my adulthood, but I want to do something about it now.  


It was recently brought to my attention, from an unbiased source, that I have difficulties taking responsibility for mistakes or mishaps, and since then I have been hyper aware of every time I shift blame off of myself, even for the smallest mistakes. If someone brings a mistake or an issue to my attention, my first instinct is to redirect the blame onto someone or something else. It makes me severely uncomfortable to admit fault, and I need to get it together.  


For some background;  
I'm 24F, college graduate, working full time and paying rent in a shared house with other late 20's-early 30's roommates. I have a great relationship with my parents and my older sister (as of now, we didn't have the best relationship growing up but we're great now, and we disagree very rarely). This 

  
I feel the need to reiterate that my relationship with my parents has always been amazing from their end. They've always been loving and disciplinary in a healthy way, and they make amazing parents despite my rough patches. I did not suffer any kind of physical, emotional, verbal, etc. abuse from my parents. However, for whatever reason, my anxiety starts spiraling the moment I feel that anyone at all is even mildly disappointed in me (or not disappointed at all, just pointing out a mistake). I can't shake the crushing feeling when I know I've messed up, and someone else is upset because of it.I'm like a perfectionist but only for myself, and not a good one because I still make mistakes, I just beat myself up about them. I think I shift blame as a way to counteract this anxiety, but I really don't want to do that anymore. I'm an adult woman, and I need to be in a position to confidently take responsibility for my mistakes.  


I know a lot of us say it's easier to spout things off to strangers, but it really is. If anyone has any advice, or can relate at all, it'd be greatly appreciated.  


I'm also going to reiterate, I DO NOT LIKE THIS ABOUT MYSELF, I want to FIX it. I agree shifting blame is NOT okay, and should not be a means to cope with anxiety. I don't want this to be a coping mechanism, but I also don't know how to break this habit.",11Nov2019,1

I don't exactly know what happened, but my work doesn't keep my mind occupied anymore. I will say that I loved my work for what it was, but it was always clear that I was just putting things off. I've literally wanted to be dead for as long as I can remember; my earliest memory is that of the death of my great-grandmother. I tried to grasp the idea of death, and it seemed wonderful. Peaceful. None of that bullshit of life. None of that noise, that smell, that sleeping only to feel tired again, that eating only to feel hungry again, that buttoning and unbuttoning.

Hell being the option where you do the same thing everytime, if you believe you remember if you don't believe you don't really remember, put simply, I think anyway.

At least in relation to yourself, other people may, experience different versions of the same reality, but if you know you know, still I believe in a helping hand, so if you know what I mean that's all I can do for you at the moment, and I could be wrong!!! 

The exact start point, It's hard to pin down, probably because it is infinite, every time you get close you find more information, new things, or it doesn't seem to work in reverse but, it seems like you can always start again, so I don't see the problem in helping as long as you believe! Unless you want power alone. Because knowledge is power. Keep everyone updated and we are all potentially equal, but then things can go pear shaped, unless we are all on the same page cause people can mistake the belief or just want to be evil, money, to skip everything else, makes it so much easier to keep order but you lose most of the individuality in the world, peace for the civilised and unrest for uncivilized essentially.
Alternative seems to always be war, which if you do believe isn't the worst thing, things like torture are far worse in my eyes than war, but obviously war itself can be used as a torture to the people that don't believe, and I mean war in it's purest form, where the only ill intent is that one thing is actually right and the other wrong, for an example something is proven by science, that is true if we have ‚Äùproof‚Äù of it being so and there will be believers and disbelievers, one side always wins eventually and then there's peace once the war is over. With little sections of rebels left most likely, which is why we always need law. When both sides lose, that is the end...

33,"I work at a grocery store. Today during closing hours we had a very rude customer. He was drunk and tried to steal something, and one of my managers caught him. He put it back but still went on the register to ring up his few items. The whole time he is cursing, being loud and belligerent, and on multiple occasions called my manager a bitch and used the N word.

I am standing there watching the situation with all my other coworkers, and he is in line ringing up his stuff when he sees me watching. He looks at me and says to me ""Ay, tell that bitch to [something something I cant remember]"". I had been really frustrated and upset the whole time but stayed silent up until this moment. In response to what he said to me, I told him ""Bro, just calm down"". He brushed it off, but what happens next escalated it. A couple of my coworkers near me start telling me not to engage, and they start to pull me away. I can only guess I also looked and sounded extremely upset.

The man sees this and I guess in his head he thinks they are holding me back from fighting him or something, because he start to walk up to me and screams ""Man I'll beat your ass"". When he said this, several things happened. The first was a rush of memories of all the other times in my life someone threatened to fight me or do something to me and I pussied out. I either got scared, walked away, or just stayed silent. The second thought that went through my head was that all my co-workers were watching.

So I start to walk up to him in the same manner he was approaching me, and I yell out ""Do it then!"" and got in a fight stance. My co-workers pull me away and de-escalates before it ever got physical. I walked away to the back, took a breather, came back out (he was gone by then), and just went back to work. A couple people asked if I was OK and whatnot, and I just smiled and said yeah.

I talked to my close friend who has known me forever and was also there working, and he said that I needed to know when to pick my battles and that this was one of those moments where I should've just stayed quiet. He said everyone was just watching and not doing anything for a reason. I told him I just lost logical thinking when he directly told me to tell my ""bitch"" of a manager to gtfo or w/e. I also told him the rush of thoughts I had in the moment.

In hindsight, I do understand it was stupid to engage a drunk and belligerent customer because anything can happen. But at the same time, I also admit that my desire to look tough played a major part in me actively escalating the situation.

I am sure to some people watching I looked like a hothead, fake tough, or like someone that likes to start shit unnecessarily. But I also know some people saw that and in their minds they gained more respect for me, for whatever reason it may be.

Personally, I find it kinda crazy this dude was calling someone a bitch directly and repeatedly and no-one said a word and even let him ring up his items and walk out on his own accord.",11Nov2019,1

This goes onto my GFs family as well: we have been dating for ~4 years now and I have met her family outside of parents/siblings a grand total of 4 times by my choice. (Usually thanksgiving)

This excludes her uncle as he is my tattoo artist and has been for years.

As of now her family thinks I have EXTREME social anxiety (I never told them this, they just assume it) which isn't necessarily wrong, although I wouldn't even put it anywhere close to ""extreme."" 

My girlfriend obviously loves her family but she does understand that they are NOT pleasant to be around in the first place, so she doesn't mind me not seeing them.

Obviously I would never hold her back from seeing family and if she wanted them to ever come visit I would be 110% ok with it, but would hide in the bedroom and just sleep until they are gone.

I have never understood the sheer annoyance I get when around anyone who may call me family; as if I'm obligated to like/trust/respect them. Its sickening to me. 

The only source of this that I could think of is the fact that my parents never forced me to go to family events once I was old enough to be home alone.

That led to me essentially never seeing any of my family outside of my immediate family for a few years. I basically vanished as far as they were concerned; and to this day I couldnt be more satisfied with that.

There is no bad blood, no hate, just this weird feeling of people thinking they know who I am (even remotely) and not knowing a single thing.

Even the children in my family drive me fucking crazy when I could find a complete strangers kid absolutely adorable.

I'm fucking weird I know; but honestly none of this really bugs me at all. I guess that might change over time, but until that happens I'm going to continue doing what I do.

Honestly, just talking to him made me wet so I was readyyyyy. I ended up going to see him one day before heading the gym. I got to his house and we sat on the couch and just started talking about life and it was dope cause I felt we were connecting on a mental level. He then proceeds to rub my inner thigh as he‚Äôs telling me about what‚Äôs going on in his life. I try to ignore the sensation of my pussy throbbing cause I didn‚Äôt wanna dismiss anything he was venting to me about. Eventually he pulls me in and I‚Äôm straddling him, making out. Things went from 0 to 100 &amp; once i felt his fingers inside me I pause &amp; say ‚Äú you have a condom right‚Äù I was on birth control but we all know a baby isn‚Äôt the only thing you can get from unprotected sex so I wanted to play it safe. So he‚Äôs like ‚Äúyea yea of course‚Äù gets up and grabs one from his room. He comes back within 2 seconds and I can see the  hard dick print in his basketball shorts, at that point I was dripping wet and didn‚Äôt wanna waste anymore time so I finished undressing myself and pulled him onto the couch &amp; started riding him. We then switch positions a few times and eventually I‚Äôm bent over the couch. He‚Äôs giving me back shots, I‚Äôm throwing it back &amp; it‚Äôs a great. At some point while he was hitting it from the back i felt myself about to orgasm so I reached my hand down to my clit and started rubbing myself to enhance things that‚Äôs when my hand managed to feel his dick &amp; I realized there was no condom on! So my initial thought was that it‚Äôs somewhere inside me &amp; right when I was about to stop things he grabbed onto my waist and finished inside of me !

So at this point I‚Äôm like what the fuck. I ask him like ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs the condom??‚Äù And he‚Äôs like ‚Äúoh shit what you mean? Maybe it‚Äôs inside of you‚Äù and whole time he has this confused ass face like he really doesn‚Äôt know where it is ! So I‚Äôm over here shoving my fingers inside of my tryna find a damn condom that isn‚Äôt even in me. Then I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwait, you try you have longer fingers than me‚Äù so he really puts 2 fingers in and pretends to search for something he knows is not there. That‚Äôs when I look down and I see the condom next to his basketball shorts and realize he took it off! So now I am HEATED. I confront him about it &amp; his excuse was, exact words ‚Äúyour pussy was so wet I just had to feel it with nothing on‚Äù &amp; I‚Äôm like ?????? so you go behind my back and take it off without asking. Cool. Got it. I got dressed and just left. Like how are you gonna help me look for a condom you know damn well you took off yourself and threw !?  Lord. 

Thankfully, nothing came from it. I waited between 4-6 weeks and got tested &amp; everything came back fine. I was just in disbelief how someone can feel entitled to do that. &amp; I‚Äôll never forget how he had that dumbass face on really acting confused like he didn‚Äôt know where the condom was. His acting skills were on point but still fuck you for doing that.",11Nov2019,1
37,"I cried for a sec at this thing I went to with my sister &amp; people, cos my anxiety was like so fucking bad for some reason?  I tried really hard to suck it up, mostly because my sister was trying to have a good time and I didn‚Äôt wanna ruin it for her.  I‚Äôm literally sleeping in a bed full of Disney pillow pets with my dog, in a room decorated as fuck with cute *stuff*.  I‚Äôm a literal child like this is my childhood room with my childhood dog and I still live with my mom and sister, I am SO sheltered.  I need a career but I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm capable of.

Right now, I want to kill myself less than I have in the past because I have my mom and sister and boyfriend.  So depression down = anxiety up?  I fucking hate going to my job, too.

aside from the fact that i‚Äôm broke, flawed, and honestly crazy, you still like me.

i really want to like you back and hang out but recently a lot has gone wrong in my life. 

over the summer i was super depressed and addicted to escapes. i was also very alone.

among this loneliness i had some one nights stands. 

i‚Äôm not sure which interaction it was, but i contracted herpes. and to be honest it‚Äôs broken my spirits, and i‚Äôm scared. 

i haven‚Äôt told had to tell any girl yet, but i really want to hang out with you but i‚Äôm scared that telling you this will make you not want to be close to me. 

i don‚Äôt know how to be intimate anymore. i‚Äôm terrified of myself. it feels like a curse and i‚Äôm so fucking scared to haunt anyone with it. 

i just needed to get it off my chest.

40," 

 I saw someone that posted on here earlier about finding their long distance love. I have somewhat the same situation so i figured hey ill post my story. Its a bit different because i love her but im not in love with her, yet that is.

 The other day i was just trying to make friends and i messaged this Aussie girl since she was into video games and said she has a cute dog (i am passionate about animals,i love them) but anyways we just started talking and she happened to be playing the same game i had been into. So the next day i asked for her snap chat so i could see who she was. Wasn't expecting anything just wanted to know who i was talking to, but she was beautiful.  

 We continued to talk about our selfs and we have so much in common. We both love nature and animals. We are into the same type of video games. And there is much more we share interests in. Its like the female version of myself, we relate and even get how each other act and mess around. She is the first women i have ever talked to where i dont have to try so hard to continue the conversation. I feel comfortable talking to her. 

 So she lives in Australia which is somewhere i have always loved. I even joked about if i ever got a divorce i was going to move there. I think Australia is beautiful and so diverse. She has wandered in the bush a bit and sent me pictures and i love it. She is the sweetest person ive ever talked to, she is beautiful, she has a cute accent, a lovely personality. I love her, but i love and care very easily but it usually feels wrong when i start to love and care for people i haven't talked to for too long. I am not in love with her i just care deeply about her and love who she is.  

 She genuinely cares about me and wants me to be safe, always telling me to not text her when i drive and little cute things like that. I trust her and usually i have a major problem with trust issues but not with her. I have been majorly depressed which ruined my marriage and made my wife fall out of love with me. I have set myself on the right path since and have been researching Buddhism (she has studied it aswell and also meditates). I used to be jealous but i am no longer. Ive been trying to learn about the real me and love myself, I have started loving myself because she is similar and if shes so great then i should be to. 

  With myself starting to love myself for who i am and feel comfortable being myself. I have decided to do what makes me happy and follow my dreams. She has agreed to sponsor me when i am ready to apply for my visa. I am going to be going to school to be an electrician then get some experience before i move so i look like a good candidate to let have a visa. She is getting her own house soon and told me i am welcome to be her room mate when i move. Now this will be a couple years before i can even apply but its so nice having her there for me, she teaches me how they talk and what not. 

 We have made plans for me to come visit her when she gets her own place so we can meet each other. I think of her as a friend because i dont want to have an expectation on what we will be i just want her in my life even as a friend. But im going to end this here because i could go on and on all day about her. Also im tired. 

 But moral of this story is no matter where you are in life you could meet the right person for you. Just stay positive and enjoy your life until you meet them and always keep an open mind about love because no love is the same. I hope you could bare with me since im tired and it may be me just rambling. Anyways feel free to send me a chat and we can talk about life, i can help you through something or just be there for you. I have a BIG heart and love helping those in need.",11Nov2019,1
41,"We met at university. Nearly one year ago, he enrolled in the same program as I did. He was in need of a team member, so did I. That was when we got to know each other. We clicked almost instantly. We share similar core beliefs, world views and moral senses. We started hanging out more often, working on assignments or just chilling at his hostel sometimes. At some point, we started flirting over texts, then irl. I thought he would be my best of friends. I was wrong.

I remembered it clearly, how I caught feelings. He, his current girlfriend (21M), and I were on a trip. He was driving, and I was sitting at the back when he called me out (specifically my name) and sang along to the radio, ""How lucky I am to meet you"" (translated from a local love song). And that's when I fell hard for him. I do not know, till now, why I had fallen so hard for him. He's not very good looking, chubby even. He's childish at times. He has bad breath. 

But still, I found myself gravitating towards him. I started seeing him everywhere, everything reminded me of him. I can hear his voice everywhere. Once, I had even drove to his hostel by accident, even when my destination wasn't there. I could spend the whole day going out with him (I am a major introvert), and still miss him after that. I suddenly became extremely self-conscious. I never told him how I feel (but I‚Äôm sure he had probably guessed partially). I feel like I should tell him, but I‚Äôm scared it will affect our current relationship.

I tried to remind myself that he's just a friend, that he is straight, that he has a girlfriend, that he just thinks of my as a friend, and tried to brushed it all off as just a crush, but he started caring for me, flirted more with me, getting more touchy with me (he touched my dick and grabbed my ass on more than one occasion). Then, there are these mixed signals. He would call me ‚Äúdarling‚Äù and say things like, ‚ÄúI miss you. Do you miss me?‚Äù, ""I would bring you home, but my parents will kill me if they found out"" (we live in a pretty conservative society) or, ""You're my number one, she's (referring to his gf) my number two‚Äù, albeit jokingly. And when I thinking there might be a shot, he would stop, leaving me confused and broken. Then, I started coming to terms with myself, he would start all over again. It's confusing the hell out of me.

I tried to distance myself from him, I tried to find myself a new crush (20F), I tried to make things work with the new crush (we're in a stage of being more than friends right now), but I still keep thinking of him. The more I tried to extricate myself, the more I am trapped in this weird relationship.

It has gotten much worse, as I started to work in the same company he‚Äôs in and we would meet nearly daily for the past few months. I hate and love being around him. When I‚Äôm around him, I would be depressed constantly reminded about what I would lose out on as he keeps me happy. But when I‚Äôm avoiding him, I would be depressed constantly missing him. He‚Äôs inextricably tied to my social, work, and study life right now, and that‚Äôs why it is so hard to avoid him at all. We would probably go our separate ways next year after graduation, though, and I‚Äôm already dreading the prospects of it.

I am going crazy right now. I feel like I‚Äôm being obsessive and bedeviled. I am expecting more than I should be. I love him, but I did not wish to admit it, not because I did not want to admit I am bisexual, but because I knew he is not. I just wish for our relationship to evolve to the highest level possible without having any of us saying it out. I‚Äôm a mess right now, I had been listening to sad songs lately, and it‚Äôs not helping, but I can‚Äôt quit.

Weirdly though, I do not lust after him. Sure, I might be curious to see how he is underneath those clothes, but it is just curiosity speaking. I do not fantasize about sex with him, but rather about life with him in an alternate universe where everything is perfect. That is to say, I‚Äôm not even sure myself if this is romance or just plain bromance. I had never get so attached emotionally to anyone so deeply before, and it's scaring me.

Please Reddit, can someone advise me on what I can do to resolve this mess? Thanks for reading this.",11Nov2019,1

45,"https://np.reddit.com/r/StolenValor/comments/do4blu/just_about_every_twitter_account_with/

I wanna try staying calm here but it's very hard especially when this fruitcake had a 2 week long meltdown in /r/stolenvalor by accusing just about every anti-Trump vets as stolen valor and then say that Andrew Yang is not an American. Furthermore I smell a keyboard warrior so I feel like wanna to meet him in Roblox Criminal v. Swat game and beat him to a pulp.

Here's disclaimer: I'm a civilian, but on Roblox I'm member of some military groups so I can somehow relate the feelings of real vets too.

Exhibit A

&gt; John McCain is a disgrace to this country. Also, if the draft came back today, majority of people would dodge it. Unless you were drafted yourself, then you have no right to call anyone out for draft dodging. Also, if I may ask, what about the democrats better represents the patriotism that vets present than Trump? Trump is about America first. How do you get more patriotic than that? Look at all the dems on the debate stage raising their hands to giving illegal aliens healthcare. You even have Yang, a non-American, wanting to be president. If you are a veteran and support liberals, then in my book, you aren't a true vet. And I am not a vet myself, but as someone who have family who served, I have the right to say that as they would agree with me.

Exhibit B

&gt; You are a liberal but yet you carry a gun. You realize you violate your very party's creed, right? You realize they want to confiscate your guns, right? If you're a white male, then they want you dead after they use you for your purpose. Their goal is to exterminate whites and send us like sheep to the slaughter very similar to Hitler and Mao. Unfortunately, you are proof that age doesn't always equate to wisdom.

Exhibit C

&gt; Did you also support Obama's impeachment? If not then you arent a true vet.


Exhibit D

&gt; No thanks, I went to school for CS so that I can have a good job and not make sub-par wage.

Hypocritically, Exhibit E

&gt; Military is for those who lack brainpower anyways.

Exhibit F

&gt; Nope. Hate to break it to you, but there is nothing hard about getting through the military.

49,"This is a message for You. My lying, condescending, arrogant, self centred first love. You fucking destroyed me. You took everything I ever worked for in life and stole it, sold it, and then lied to my face about it. You convinced me to invest in something that would better our future, but it turned out to be a front. A front for your own personal gain. A way for you to wash the money you were so good at making. And while you convinced me that you were a broke girl, I worked my ass off to pay for the house you wanted to live in. To pay for the fancy gifts on holidays. 

You sold drugs behind my back, you fucked men for cash behind my back. You ran scams behind my back. You alienated me from everything I ever loved. Family. Hobbies. Friends. You told me you loved me, but when the time came, you chose to go party. You chose to disappear for 2 weeks. You chose to bail on a life I gave everything up for, just to help you create. I gave up my space for your corrupt family. I gave up my money for your corrupt business, I wasted years of my life listening to your bullshit. 

And now that its all said and done, and we both chose our path, I dipped down to almost nothing. I lived out of my car. I split my last 20 dollars between food and gas. And you have the audacity to expect forgiveness. While I was picking up my shattered life, You lived the high life. Sure, You made it last for a while, but You got involved with the wrong people. The people You could have avoided had you chose the straight path I was on. 

Now, 2 years later, as I lay here in my warm bed, and re-read the news article about your violent crimes, I am reminded that you will waste in a prison cell long after I have forgotten You completely. This, Finally, Makes, Me, Happy.

53,"Hey guys!
This has been happening to me for quite some time now; at least as far back as my memory can recall. Or as far back as my social interactions have begun sprouting and having significance in my life. This may sound stupid or of little importance, but it's really affecting my social life.
Whenever I'm around people, I tend to laugh for no apparent reason, and I always find myself incapable of controlling it. It's not the sort of laughter that one enjoys or that is produced due to a mirth-inducing occasion; instead, it's something of absolutely no source. It's very absurd and - to me - rather outrageous. It's always unbidden and unexpected. It may happen when hearing somebody tell a very normal story that doesn't necessarily induce laughter, or when I meet someone casually, or when I'm discussing literally anything with anyone... and it's not that sort of light, likeable laughter, but it's something completely revolting and annoying - both to me and to others - and in other times offensive. It makes everyone think I'm some sort of clown which I'm not, and it stops them from taking me seriously when they should or when I want them to. And it's not something bound to me naturally or, in other words, some kind of disorder that always takes place, but it's bound sheerly to my social interactions and when I'm surrounded by people.

54,"My friends and I went to an Anamanaguchi concert in Chicago and it started snowing just as the show was beginning (7pm). Thankfully it was warm enough in Chicago for the snow to not stick to the road initially, so by the time we got out the road was only wet. However... As we got on the highway, things got messy and very bad very fast.

1. Immediately past a bridge ~75ish miles into the 250 mile drive back home, snow starts sticking to the ground. I drop down from 60-70mph to 40-50mph almost immediately.

2. 4WD vehicles (SUVs, pickup trucks, 4WD cars) drove recklessly and frequently hit 60-70mph in the snow driving right beside other drivers, sometimes slamming on the brakes as other cars were also driving 40-50mph.

3. Driving past snowplows is pure stress. Massive semis nearly rammed into us driving past three snowplows, all separate occasions. They shadowed our car and I had to speed up very quickly while snow was building up and just hope that I didn't get pushed off the road by a truck. They immediately sped up after passing us and hit upwards of 70mph.

4. Some people just flat out drove like shit, swerving each and every direction and passing people left and right in the snow. We were all mostly driving 45ish mph, and they were swerving around at around 60mph.

5. There was a moment where two pairs of semis were going extremely fast, coming up behind us and another vehicle in the separate lane, forcing us both off our paths, making the other vehicle nearly crash into the snow. I would guess they were driving maybe 60mph while pushing us aside. They made no attempts to stop at all.

6. As we get back into town, people begin gunning it to the next exits and I couldn't find the chance to slow down for our exit because of this. It was either drive faster or get rammed.

I'm still completely stressed out. I have no idea if I'm going to be sleeping because of this. No moment of driving in the snow has ever compared or came close to this. I'm thanking God that I'm still alive, because I have no idea at all how I made it out of the highway system without getting killed.",11Nov2019,1

60,"Hello Reddit, today I had one of the weirdest encounters at KFC so I thought I just had to share it with you.

So tonight I was sitting at home not wanting to cook, when I remembered that the KFC nearby me was still open. I put on my jacket and headed over to the local train station (I live in japan so restaurants are common in the train station areas) to get some dinner. I got in to the restaurant behind a decent line of people, apparently it‚Äôs popular to go to the KFC at 9:00pm.

I went up to the counter and a kindly old lady greeted me, I asked for the chicken fillet sandwich, my usual order. the lady tells me it will take extra time to cook the sandwich but I could eat my fries and drink my drink at the table and she would bring the sandwich to me. So I said okay and took my tray with fries and an empty cup, found my table, then went back to the self service drink fountain to fill up my beverage. I filled the cup up with ice and Pepsi, but decided not to put a lid on it, since I prefer to sip my drink from the cup rather than have a plastic straw.

After I returned to my seat is when things became a bit strange. The old lady made her way through the crowded restaurant up to me with my chicken sandwich in hand, she set it down on my tray and I thanked her for bringing it. She said nothing in response but eyed my cup with a suspicious glance. She then proceeded to walk away, at this point I figured she was going back to her post as there were still people in line, but when I looked up form a bite of my delicious burger I noticed that she had gone to the Drink Fountain. I thought it a bit odd  but made nothing of it until she then took a lid and a straw and began to make her way back to my table. At this point my mouth was still full of burger so I couldn‚Äôt say anything to her, I could only watch as she put a lid down on my drink and began to open the straw. She had torn the straw packaging the wrong way so she couldn‚Äôt get the straw out smoothly. She then walked over to the trash can threw away the first straw and collected a second one. At this point I had finished my bite of food but I was stunned, what do I say in this situation, things have gotten so surreal by this point I‚Äôm starting to think there are hidden cameras. She then opens the second straw package placing the straw through the plastic lid using the plastic wrapper so she is certain not to touch the straw. She then pointed the straw towards me and said ‚ÄúDozo‚Äù basically ‚Äúgo ahead‚Äù or ‚Äúhelp yourself‚Äù. Trying to maintain my composure I take a drink as the lady watches me not saying a word, I then tell her thank you once more and she goes back to her station.

This might have been one of the most uncomfortable interactions that I have ever had. If you have any questions about the event I‚Äôm happy to answer down below.",11Nov2019,1
61,"What should I do if my mom is constantly threatening me to send to another country? I already have a life here in America and lived here for around 7-8 years, I am 16 right now. 

I used to live in the other country when I was younger, but I have no life there, no friends, no anything, and I don't speak the language of that country that well to be able to get through their school-- so I don't even know how I am going to build a life there. 

I go to a good school, and I have friends I love and care about in America. Moving to another country would mean I could no longer see my friends and I can't imagine a life without them. I have a whole career plan I built ahead of me in America.

My mom uses the threat any time anything happens, despite the fact that I did nothing wrong. For example, I was organizing my papers from my folder into separate subjects and papers I don't need. It took me a good 2 and more hours to do this. Then my grandma just comes into my room and messes all the papers up because they were getting in her way. I was really pissed because that meant I had to start all over again. Then I was telling her why did you do that? That took me hours to complete, now I have to start all over again. 

Then my mom hears me complaining and she comes in and she is like ""why is there a mess in your room?"" I tell her that I've been organizing the papers and that they all got disshuffled-- but she was like stop giving me attitude or I will send you to \[that country\].

And if I get pissed anytime for a valid reason like the earlier example, she also starts threatening me. 

But my mom is constantly being toxic and is constantly saying/doing mean things. 

For example, I got mad at my mom because she was saying trash things/making fun of my boyfriend all because of his appearance. She latches on to the fact that his skin is dark and that is he is Bengali. It infuriates me to the core. He is the sweetest person, he never did drugs, and he is caring and generous and my mom is being presumptious.

62,I‚Äôm not suicidal and maybe I‚Äôm exaggerating a little. I just look at some of my habits I picked up over the years. I was quite skinny growing up and had no bad habits except for smoking which is obviously a bad one. I now vape which I know is better than smoking but I do chain vape a lot. I developed a mental illness which meant I had to take antipsychotics for life. I‚Äôm completely stable now and it was more of a case of me going crazy rather than depressed. The medication made me gain about 4 stone and now I‚Äôm overweight and have quite bad eating habits. I will generally eat ok but I ruin this every couple of days by ordering junk food and I can honestly say that I feel addicted to it. That and Diet Coke I do on the regular. Also because of my medication my prolactin is raised which I‚Äôm not really sure what this means for me. I have heard of it being linked to the C word but others deny this. I‚Äôm a bit worried because I love my life. I have a beautiful girlfriend who I celebrated my anniversary with yesterday and we have a bright future. I can only see my eating habits getting worse and I don‚Äôt have the strength to give up vaping. I have tried countless times to change my ways. The silver lining is I do a shed load of walking in my job so this will balance it out a bit. I do over 10 miles walking every day. Does it sound like I‚Äôm screwed? I‚Äôm not sure how bad this is,11Nov2019,1

I was so gushing to meet people and strike up conversations, but I felt colleagues who had more fulfilling weekends probably don't feel the same way. I've been going on trips &amp; adventures by myself just so that the darkness doesn't descend on me when I'm free. Over my entire course of college, I've barely made 4-5 friends and even on them, I'm pretty sure I'm just dumping all my sadness and that they're just putting up with me. I make myself deliberately goofy &amp; lame cuz I'm not sure I'm Interesting company otherwise. I like a girl but her signals told me that she isn't interested, I'm scared that I'll turn into one of those 'nice guys' with her. And moreover, no girl would be able to take in so much baggage that I'll end up dumping on her as a boyfriend. I  can't confess to my parents about how I'm feeling cuz they're already going through a lot and I'd never want to tell them anything than that would make them happy about me. I value people around me so much just because they're the only company I e and sometimes I feel disgusted with myself that I need to be more affirmative, and also, I'm scared that I'll come across as too clingy to them.I try to hide my birthday as much as possible simply because I know that people will let me down a d funnily, for those who made efforts for me, I feel that I don't deserve it. Life has become all about survival and trying to make myself happy, while the loneliness is clawing me from inside. My social anxiety kills me when I want to go out by myself, making me so Soo uncomfortable &amp; self-conscious about my every step. 

On the flip side, I'll be very bright as sun by tomorrow and I myself won't be able to believe that I could be even this sad. I'll be the most chirpy, upbeat guy you'd have come across until something  caves inside me and I'll hit the bottom. It's almost surprising how I can be any of the two versions.

I don't really have any type of motivation. It's really hard to push myself to do simple things at home. At this point in my life I know that I should be figuring out a career plan or have some idea of what I want to do. Nothing really comes to mind when I think about the future. I have hobbies, but nothing I feel that I could do for a living.

I tend to get really anxious when someone mentions what they want to do after University or talks about the future, Even when I am genuinely happy for them. My SO always talks about their plan and is an extremely hard worker. I know that in a relationship you shouldn't compare yourself but it's hard not to. When they start to talk about it I mentally shut down and I don't know why. I want to be supportive and show that I care. I'm just terrified of being left behind.

My parents weren't really there for me when I was growing up and I don't know if that could be part of the problem. It's hard for me to be close to people without feeling like they are eventually going to hate me, Even when the relationship is perfectly fine. By trying to keep people close I feel like i'll end up pushing them away. I need a lot of reassurance and I hate that about myself. 

It's becoming too much and I needed to do something so I figured this was kind of a first step.

81,"Alright, settle in, this is going to be a long post.

A little bit about me, i am an immigrant from a third world country, came to the US 4 years and a half ago with my whole family. I grew up in a christian household, with an amazing family, i was 17 years old when we moved here, i am 21 now, and i am male.

The first year in the US was hard on me, on my entire family really, but i want to talk about me right now. i was 240 lbs\~ 6'0"" when i got to the us. I liked sports, had a few close friends back in my country, didn't really have any hobbies besides programming (you can probably guess what i'm majoring in now eh ?). I never finished high school, when I came here i submitted my grades to be adjusted and i was told i can go into college, so that is what i did naturally. I am in college now, 4 classes away from getting my associates.

So i got here, i am finally in the US, after 17 years of waiting for my family's papers. I have no friends, I have nothing to do, and no money, so i turned to gaming, I racked in a good 5000 hours on steam in 2 years, that is about 7 hours a day, but realistically i was playing up to 12 hours everyday for the better part of a year. I would wake up, eat, game, sleep, repeat. and i saw what this did to my family, they were all heartbroken, i was doing nothing, not enjoying life, becoming suicidal, i had gained 80 lbs in about 4 years, july of this year i was 320 lbs, 6'2"" (yay! i gained two inches...), i had prediabetes, and i was struggling with my self esteem and hated myself.

July of this year i made a life changing decision, i told my online friends that i won't be playing with them again, i deleted all my gaming accounts, steam, origin, everything... i stopped gaming, just like that, i don't miss it, i don't like it anymore, what hurts the most is that my older brother, tried to get me to stop for the entirety of the time that i was gaming, but what did it ? a crush... yes a crush. I developed a crush on my boss, we went out a couple times, and i started thinking about her a LOT, i couldn't sleep sometimes because i was thinking about her, so i decided to friendzone her, because at that point it was clear she wasn't really interested in me that way, which was fine, can't force attraction when there isn't any... Now she is my best friend, i sleep just fine, and i love myself, about 2 months ago i started working out and doing intermittent fasting, today i am at 291 lbs, first time under 300 lbs in a year, i am proud of myself. but i still long for human connection, i have been single my entire life, my interests changed completly, I am somewhat of a gym rat now, i LOVE working out, i workout 6-7 times  a week, i am losing weight, gaining muscle (slowly but surely, noobie gains) i fit in my size 38 pants from 2 years ago, my size 40 dress pants are too big on me now. I am posting this to remind myself why i started, why i won't stop, the past 2 weeks have been bad, went out for a few too many drinks with my new found friend. I have so many goals, that i can't even start working on for a while, until i am back at a normal weight, or there are monetary/time obstacles. I want to get a motorcycle, but i live in the north east, it is freezing right now, i have to wait atleast 3-4 months, even if i do wait, i don't have the money to buy a motorcycle. I really want to get into calisthenics, gymnastics, and parkour, i have always wanted to do this, ever since i was a kid, i want to take up some form of martial arts. As i said, i love the man i am becoming, slowly but surely i will get there, i just have to keep working on it.

I (19F) am a manager at a fast food place. I essentially just run shift and make sure everything is running smoothly. On Friday, I was working the overnight shift (9pm to 5am) and I only had about 4 other employees in the building with me. One of the employees, Jeremy (fake name) was on this shift. Jeremy is a good worker but he has evident mental issues and is overall a sweet kid; however, he doesn‚Äôt necessarily like being told what to do. On this shift, he was cleaning the fry area and forgot to dry it which is required before we start using it again so I asked him if he could please dry it off after and then I left to go and count drawers.

The shift was almost over and Jeremy was off in the next 20 minutes so I told him to go home. I waited for my GM who was the morning manager and let him know what happened, and his response seemed extremely uncaring and unconcerned. I came back into my shift the next day and found out Jeremy was suspended for three days and that he would be returning to my shifts on Tuesday.

I honestly do not feel safe working with him and I‚Äôm considering transferring to another store because of this.

Why are so many people confused (is that the right word?) about what gender they are? 

I‚Äôve read a bit about it that male and female is biological sex and not gender but why are so many people uncomfortable in what body they are born in? 

Why is a man saying he is a woman? In this society it is acceptable to be who you are so why don‚Äôt they just be themselves ie a man and act how they want ie like a woman? I don‚Äôt understand why there is so much drama with what they are called?

It‚Äôs causing so much hate and drama in the world when there are much more important issues. I literally do not care what anybody wants to be and I will support them all the way, I‚Äôm just curious.

So for a while now I have been feeling a bit down, and somewhat scared about where life is going to take me if that makes sense. Because of this, I fear that my closest friends don't like me and will leave me eventually. 

Although when I think rationally, this probably will not happen. However, a while ago I was listening to some love songs, one of those that sings about ""you"", so directly towards the listener. And for some reason, instead of passively imagening someone else singing it to 'me', I imagined myself singing it to me. And the lyrics about not leaving 'me' made me feel so comfortable. I am never going to leave me behind, and I will always be there for me!

I'm not sure if this makes sense, however I sincerely hope this helpful for some of you too &lt;3

97,"This account is my throwaway account, which explains my lack of history. I delete every post after it's been up and used. I admit things here that I can't on my regular account, lest I sully my reputation and karma and look like a fool. 

I don't know how I came across it, but I was recently watching the Elliot Rodger retribution video again and couldn't help sympathizing with a lot of what he was saying. I also read his manifesto, and it terrified me how similar this guy sounds to myself. I understand his anger, his rage, his feelings of unworthiness, because I'm the exact same way...except with horses rather than dating/sex. It enrages me that so many other people, everywhere I look these days, get to be around horses and ride them, but not me. It's gotten to the point where I break down in hysterical tears of rage every time I open Instagram and see some spoiled brat on a horse. I feel intense hatred towards them and just want to destroy the universe and everything in it because it was so cruel to me, putting me in a geographical and financial place where horses are unaccessible to me. 

While I don't condone Elliot's actions, I can, to some extent, sympathize with them. I don't think the murder of random people can ever be justified, but I do understand how unworthy and how hopeless a person can feel when the thing they want more than just about anything has been denied them their whole life. That's why I feel pity for a lot of the incel ideology, because even though I have no interest in sex and relationships, I do have an interest in riding horses, and the fact that I can't engage in such activities fills me with so much anger and self-loathing. I think about suicide on a daily basis (not just because of the horse thing, to be fair). Honestly, if I saw any potential way out of this hell, I would take it, but as it stands, I really don't have the means to afford a horse, or even riding lessons, And like I said, I live in such a shitty, boring town that those kinds of things aren't even offered anyway. I'll be honest, there's also a big part of me that's embarrassed to admit this is something I'd like to try‚Äìam *dying* to try, and have for most of my life. 

It devastates me that I'm in so much pain and I don't know how to help myself. I want the love of a pet more than just about anything, but for one, my mom is allergic to anything with fur, so we can't have a pet in the house. She also won't let me get something small and caged, like a hamster, claiming it would ""stink up the house."" I know I can always visit animals at shelters and whatnot, but it's just not the same as having one of my own to bond with and love forever. 

I'm trying to filter horses from my internet search feeds, because I don't want that shit appearing anywhere on my computer. I'm sick of that garbage being shoved in my face, like the universe is cruelly mocking me and taunting me with what I want so desperately, but can't have. I feel sick and disgusted when I see other people riding horses, it makes me hate this world and wish it would get hit with a meteor or something. Dramatic, I know, but this pain has been a part of me for so long, and I'm at my breaking point. I literally feel like I might die if my situation doesn't change, and fast.

I'm a cashier for a busy corner shop. I get around ¬£1800 a month which is okay, there's not many people who do the same job who would get the same money. It's okay.

My mental health is obviously damaged with that list of diagnostics and to be honest I wouldn't feel comfortable nor confident to go for my dream jobs anymore, there is one I am tempted to go for, a police dog trainer, but my dream job was always a police officer. It would be impossible now because of my medical history, probably the dog trainer too but I might still try for it, one day. If I fail it's fine I guess, at least I tried right?

But i'm just not sure what to do since quitting weed.

I moved from England to Wales some 6 years ago because I was a drug dealer and the police were starting to follow me around, I turned my life around really just as I had hoped. I don't have to wake up and turn my phone on at 9am anymore and meet people every 15 minutes untill 10pm -- and all the unsavoury activities that come with that lifestyle. I didn't carry a gun, but the people I met with did and that was also part of the turning point for me. You can just see where your life is headed, prison or dead.

So I should be grateful for my okay job in the middle of no where with some friends some 20-30 years older than me. Still some family closeby too. I should be grateful because the alternative was prison or dead. I always said this to myself when I moved, it couldn't get worse even if this is suicidal depression with loneliness. That's not worse than prison or dead, right?

When I moved here I had nothing to do except get high and play video games so I picked up the World of Warcraft. 

Lol.

I did say i'd be brutally honest because I usually delete my posts but, you guys don't need to hear about my WoW character. It's just a good character on a game I enjoy, i'm about to go back to the game and do some healing -- that's all I know. I heal people and hope they're having fun because I kept them alive and to be frank I can do it with my eyes closed or whilst crying and sometimes I do just start crying when i'm healing, I have a saying for when it happens i'll say in my head or outloud 'you don't know it, but your healer is crying' whilst i'm in the middle of a fight with 20-40 players.

Those people who I heal on that game have no idea how much it means and doesn't mean to me to be there in that moment keeping them alive. It's a love hate relationship. I obviously love it because i've done it so much but I have come to loathe or hate it.

I'm just not sure what to do since quitting weed.

I force myself to work out 5 out of 7 mornings a week and in time that workout routine will improve and get better and be more interesting as I grow and learn. I've started to eat more because of that (that's the main idea) and soon I want to start driving lessons so I can get some dogs and just have a bit more freedom to explore.

What I really want to say is that it's all pointless though, it all just means nothing to me. I'm getting teary as I type this right now because I can feel it deep down inside my very soul how little it all means. I obviously have some hidden strength to better my life and because my financial situation changed 6 months ago a window of oppourtunity has opened.

My flat used to be empty, now it's full of stuff.

New clothes.

Cuboards, fridge, freezer -- all full.

Before I know it i'll have that van and those dogs, then we'll move into an actual house with a garden.

I'll do it even though deep down it means nothing to me.

I want to say something else before I end this post, when I was unemployed (which lasted a good 3 years or so) I used to live off of around ¬£600 a month so there was basicly no food and my flat was empty and the only thing to do was to play the game. It was god awful every day for 3 years. I used to tell myself just grit your teeth and bare because when you do get a job, money, food, things to take up your spare time and even sex, will fix this suicidal depression.

I had sex with a stunning girl about 2 weeks ago and it was around that time I started to realize that money and sex is not a fix to depression.

It means nothing to me.

Sometimes I wonder if I now need love instead but you know what I can already tell that if I fell in love it would mean nothing to me.

I'd still want to die.

I'm just not sure what to do since quitting weed. Things were supposed to change and maybe, maybe I haven't given it long enough at all. I really haven't. 

Fuck it.

I gotta go do some healing.",11Nov2019,1
103,"Blizzard games are the only games where when I try to stop playing, I feel like I get cravings for.  I will have dreams about them and feel extremely moody when I am not playing, while trying to quit playing.  No games ever hook me like Blizzard games because of this, so every now and then I go back and get the same physical response every time.  I have no idea how they managed to tap into this, again they are the only game company that makes me feel like my enjoyment is addiction while playing more than anything else.  I wish I could just quit, but once a hook gets in you you get the itch in its absence for the rest of life, I suppose.",11Nov2019,1

105,"I had been asking the music teacher for weeks to let me play the piano in one of our recess, since it just so happens we have that class later. Recess ended and people started coming in, I decided not to stop playing since the teacher hadn't really asked me to stop. My crush just goes on and asks me to play a ""love song"" which I do. Later went back to my seat, which was a few seats to the side on the row behind (of him). He's turned around and talking to some girl saying how pretty she is and more, calling her a goddess and asking when they'll be able to Kiss. I played my music just so my crush could tell someone he loves them :(",11Nov2019,1
106,"I previously thought my lack of personality made people I wanted to get to know dislike me, but after much careful reflection and introspection, I have found that it is actually the fact that I have *absolutely* no idea how to act around people I like that pushes them away. My behavior changes, and I'm so focused on not being a burden, and not being annoying, and not overstepping boundaries that I make myself anxious and distant, and succeed only in convincing the people I like that I am completely disinterested, or don't like them.

So basically, I just need to chill out, let myself take up space, let myself be a potential annoyance, and then forgive myself for it, and be a human.

Ain't that just the way.",11Nov2019,1
107," 

I'm 16 and I met a girl (15) on a family vacation. We didn't really think about what would happen when we had to go our separate ways. I left this morning and have been depressed as shit all day. We were hanging out just last night and kind of realized at the same time that this was it. How can I get over this and feel better? I have her number too",11Nov2019,1
108,"I personally have a very low tolerance for that kind of stuff. Close-minded people aren't in my life.

To my boyfriend's credit, he does call them out on stuff when it happens, but... as a woman, I don't see the growth. Shaming women for being sexual and then sexualizing women. Holding general views that women aren't very smart. They aren't too successful with the ladies... shocker. Apparently sometimes he'll call them out and they try to make a point, as if there's one to make.

The beauty of it all is that my BF can be friends with whoever he wants and I don't have to like them, I guess I would just personally find their repeated sexism to be a dealbreaker. He gets where I'm coming from, but isn't gonna stop being friends with them. Which I kinda get, he's in a small town with limited options. But once he moves, I'd love to see him make better friends.",11Nov2019,1

One of my best friends mom just died and her dad is trying to take her to move with his girlfriend to Texas. Said dad has had history of abusing, hurting, and just generally harrasing my friend. I dont want to see someone I love have to live with that burden. So yeah im just lost here and don't want to lose my friend.",11Nov2019,1
110,"Honestly, what do people do during the winter? I really need some ideas for things to do during the winter. I hate this time of the year because being cooped up feels suffocating and everyone is always sick. 

It‚Äôs being snowing where I live for almost 18 hours. This is way early for us to get snow. But we have almost a foot so it‚Äôs not going anywhere. They‚Äôre predicting record snowfall for us this year anyways  (current record is like 93 inches or something). 

I need inside things to do to stay busy, nothing outside. I don‚Äôt want to touch the snow with a ten foot pole.",11Nov2019,1
