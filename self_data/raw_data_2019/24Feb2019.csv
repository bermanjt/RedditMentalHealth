0,"Hi,

I am here because I feel ridiculously stupid. I've been noticing that my GF has been kind of weird for the past 2 days maybe? And today I asked her about it and she told me that there's, in fact, something that has been going on. 

She's been thinking about the relationship a lot (we've been together for 2 years, 1 as couple) but she does not want to tell me just yet because it's not something I can change but something that either exists or doesn't and she needs some time. (We're still on a relationship. I understand and accept that she needs this time.)

I, sincerely, thought we were on a very good phase of our relationship and this hit me hard. I tried telling a friend of mine and she barely payed any attention and one of my best friends (best friend basically) told me to stop playing the victim when I told him she doesn't want to be alone with me, but she'd rather go out with a group (which I understand but still hurts).

I could tell the whole story but it would take years, I hope this is the right place, I just need to vent.

Thanks for reading.

1,"Hello there! I'm a senior in high school (female). At my high school, seniors are allowed to leave school during the month of May if they agree to undertake some sort of project of their own design and present it in June. 

Problem is, I have only a vauge idea what my project should be and I have a proposal due on Friday if I want to participate. 

I'd like my project to be based around sports and physical fitness. I love being active even though I am physically unremarkable. My gym teachers loved me. I'd like to work, somehow, on my physical abilities. For reference, I run a 10:00 mile, can do 80 crunches, 20 pushups, and can do 29 ""laps"" on the 20 meter pacer test. My ideas so far have been:

-Training so that my school fitness tests (the numbers you see above) to get them to levels more appropriate to my age

-Complete 1000 pushups!

-Train myself to become the ultimate dodgeball player (my throwing arm and dodging skills are weak!)

-Train myself to become a beastly triathlete

-Training myself in certain aspects of several sports: throwing a spiral football, shooting a three pointer, running a 9:30 mile, shooting a layup, and developing a killer dodgeball throw. 

If y'all have anything a little more substantial I'd love to hear it!",24Feb2019,1

Okay so this story mainly revolves around me (18M), a girl we'll call ""A""(15F) and a guy we'll call ""J"" (18M) 

One day at work, J asks A for her snapchat. A doesn't think anything of it and gives it to him. Later that night, J is messaging A, telling her she has a nice ass and saying a bunch of sexual things and asks this FIFTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL for nudes. A says no and J gets mad and calls her a whore and blocks her. The next day at work, J is still saying sexual things to A and starts touching her butt, rubbing his dick on her as he walks past her, etc etc. A tells me all this today, and I get fucking pissed because he obviously shouldn't be doing that shit and also because my sister (16F) and a bunch of young girls work at this restaurant. I tell A to talk to a manager about this and so she does. Meanwhile, I'm standing around, blood boiling, unable to focus on work because i'm thinking about him doing this to my sister and other girls. So, I tell him to come with me to the back. I take him into the freezer so that I can privately talk to him. I can't control my anger and yell at him something along the lines of ""what the fuck? She's fucking 15 years old. You can't be doing that shit and if I ever see you touching her, my sister or any other girls, I will beat your ass"" He seems really flippant about the whole thing, doesn't think it's a big deal. So, I just walk away before I punch him in his face. About 30 minutes later, my manager calls me into the office. He asks for my side of the story and I tell him everything truthfully,  admitting that I threatened J. My manager tells me ""This is none of your business, don't get involved in drama. I could fire you for threatening J"" I ask my manager if J is getting in trouble for what he did and all my manager would say was that he was getting sent home early today there might be ""further consequences"" if he does it again. What the fuck? So I could potentially get fired for trying to defend the young girls at work, but the guy who is making a 15 year old girl feel unsafe and uncomfortable is getting a slap on the wrist? This whole situation is fucked and i'm pissed. I doubt there will be any consequences for J because this isn't the first time there's been harassment at this restaurant. A 64 year old manager sexually harassed another 16 year old girl and he didnt have any consequences. I'm shocked at how sexual harassment at my work is just kinda swept under the rug and forgotten about. I'm so angry that I could be the one getting fired because of this whole situation. This is absolutely ridiculous.  ",24Feb2019,66

16,"I’m not really sure how to start this. I guess I’ll just tell it from my perspective. 

I’m a guy. I’ve been married almost 5 years. About 12 years ago (long before I met my wife), there was a big falling out with her family and her uncle. They chose to never talk to him or his wife ever again. 

He and his wife basically lived in isolation all that time. No friends, just each other. And to be quite honest, the whole thing was bad, but should’ve blown over after a few months. No one ever spoke to them. No one sent them cards in the mail. Nothing. They weren’t on social media of any kind, and didn’t even own a cell phone. They also never were able to have kids. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. My wife received a call from the aunt that the uncle had cancer all over his body and wouldn’t have long to live, but they really wanted to see my wife and my wife’s brother. 

I had never met this man, and I felt like he was so wrong for what he did. But it didn’t cross my mind that it was so long ago. And as I said, it really should have blown over. My wife decided to go and see them, and so did her brother. They talked, caught up, and he expressed how extremely sad he was at how the last decade of his life had played out. Said he felt so lonely and horrible because none of the family had come to see him. My wife went to see him again a few days later. He was then put on hospice. 

Then today, he passed away. 

When my wife told me, I was immediately filled with regret that I hadn’t seen him. All I could think about was how sad he must have been. He was only in his 50’s, so he didn’t even make it to enjoy retirement. I could’ve at least made the effort to see him. And now it’s too late, all because I was being too immature to see how serious it was. 

His widow will probably lose the house, as she doesn’t have the means to continue paying the mortgage. And she’s completely alone for the first time in several decades.

23,"Okay, the title is a bit too confident, the whole reason I'm posting this here is to get a discussion going and see the feasibility.

I've read an article here and there about creating digital identities, things that work even better than IRL IDs and can easily be integrated anywhere on the internet. It's not easy to make them bulletproof, but the effort might be worth it.

So lets take the example of Twitter. Twitter already has the check marks to show verified celebrities, journalists, etc., showing that any common person is verified would be similarly easy. When browsing Twitter, you would effectively know which accounts are real and which ones don't have a real identity attached to them, thus making them highly likely to be troll/bot accounts. Trusting an account that isn't verified would make little sense at all. Why would anyone not verify themselves? Anonymity is not a good reason, as I'll later explain, you can maintain full anonymity. 

So let's go behind the scenes to see the account making process. Twitter would ask me if I want to verify my identity, I'll say yes, and then use whatever mechanism of IDing that we come up with. The reason you can maintain anonymity is because Twitter doesn't actually need to know *who* the identity belongs to, just that it is in fact a real ID. They can verify that this identity hasn't been used by referencing their system. You can use a pseudonym and maintain full anonymity if you want, you don't have to give up your information to Twitter. Twitter can also request more information that you can approve. If you want to set your location in your profile, Twitter can make it necessary that you verify this. Upon doing that, Twitter can limit it so that you only use your country of citizenship/residency. Now you can't have someone in Russia pretending they're an American to mislead people. 

The catch with this form of verification is that you can't know for sure that the person is who they claim to be, just that it is a real and unique person. Of course, the option exists to share more information with Twitter if you want the world to know you are who you say you are. The name you choose would probably be restricted in this case.

Are you trying to keep your anonymity and your account got figured out? Detaching your ID from that account is easy, and making a fresh account that starts anonymized. How many times your allowed to do this and what happens to your old account would be up to Twitter. 

This sounds like the death of fake news to me, but it's entirely dependent on those IDs. The digital world is massive now and IDing is a way to maintain law and order.  ",24Feb2019,2

47,"Hi this is my first post ever. I don't know if this is the right place to share this. Please let me know, I'll delete the post myself if I have to!

This will be something like a rant but also I'm just hoping someone who went through something similar could give me some advice. (TLDR at the end)

I've been feeling pretty down lately. I'm 21 M and I was recently forced into breaking up with my ex girlfriend that I loved very much. I don't really wanna get into detail about it but basically due to circumstances I knew our relationship was doomed the way it was and despite trying to fix things we weren't able to make any significant change to where we were headed. It hurt but she understood so there's no bad blood.

About 4 weeks ago, I also had to quit my night job at a convenience store so I can focus on college and not have conflicting schedules. (Specially since commute for college is about 2 hours for me). I was promised a job at another store but the manager of that store told me I'll get employed a bit later around march/april... this is sort of a problem. I don't have money to last until april. I'll barely scrape by for march.

I've looked for jobs and even contacted my previous employer but everyone told me the same thing ""Sorry we're cutting hours we can't give you any work"" probably why my employment at this new job got delayed.

But then on my second week of school I also find out my schedule has some issues. My Thursday class is being held on Tuesdays but I have a different class to attend on Tuesdays at the same time. Somehow the college gave me a schedule with conflicting classes and now I was forced to drop one of them. Took a whole month to solve this issue and I still don't understand how this happened. But now I got to college once a week every Tuesday and regret quitting my old job because I absolutely could have worked the night shift with this kind of schedule.

I know my schedule got college sounds weird but it's a really long story that I can't bother to explain. Only those directly involved understood what the issue is but outsiders simply don't get what the deal is.

What am I supposed to do right now. It's been 6 weeks I think now where I couldn't attend my assigned class, I have such low motivation to do anything since the breakup and its difficult for me to treat myself to anything without an income. I've sacrificed a couple things so that I could join a gym and I feel like it's my only refuge right now. The only thing keeping my mind off things. But there's always something to remind me of my problems that I feel I have no control over.

For example:I was messaged by the school that I have to attend my classes or I'll get expelled which is their fault to begin with. I just paid my second month worth of bills without income yesterday and to top it off, I also caught a bad cold which is keeping me from going to the gym.

It just blows me away that not that along ago I felt like a guy who had everything going good for him. Counted my blessings, I still try. I had projects planned with friends. Was saving for an expensive plane ticket and hoped to get an appartment on my return from my vacation. I was even thinking of marriage in the distant future.

TL;DR: Had a lot of good going for me but life decided I'm losing everything keeping me on my feet and I feel like I have no control.",24Feb2019,2

I was having awful feelings about the job during the first two and a half months I have been here. I am supposed to be here till the end of March when the new teacher arrives.  There were a lot of expectations out of me being a new teacher, and I felt there was an unfair amount of pressure put on me.  I started in late November 2018, replacing a teacher who had big shoes that needed filled.  

Some of my classes started losing students ever since the prior teacher left, and I took that hard because I thought it was because of me--I am a compassionate person but I don't always show enthusiasm or bubbly-ness.  Because I was perceived to be doing poorly, I got re-evaluated at the end of January 2019 and was told by one of the staff members that she didn't see any improvement in me since I started whatsoever.  I let what she said affect my view of myself as a teacher.

I knew it was going to work this way.  I disliked the job.  Then I asked for termination.  And suddenly, everything seems okay.  It doesn't help that everywhere I read, people have had amazing experiences abroad.  I can't believe I did this to myself.  The feelings I get from my regret are akin to a break-up. At first, I felt liberated and relieved that I had asked to leave.....now it's totally biting me in the ass..

I setup my computer with dual monitor in the living room because there was no room in my shared bedroom. Normally, I'd be editing my resume according to the job description on one screen and Twitch or Runescape on the other screen. My parents (who only works 4 days a week) take turns walking by me and drops comments every thirty minutes or so. Most of them are along the lines of ""stop playing games all day and get a job,""  ""What are you even doing with your life?"" ""What's the point of wasting your life like this?"" ""When I was your age...."" By the end of the day it'd turn into full on shouting match between me and whoever was off that day. I've only been home for 2 weeks and I've only managed to send out a couple resumes (in tear). I tried to avoid them by going out during the daytime and looking during late night. My dad actually screamed at me while my mom was acting like I was single-handily tearing the family apart. I get that parents criticize out of care sometimes, but I just don't feel it from ""what have you done in your life that lets you tell me leave you alone?"" Originally, I planned on finding the perfect job near home so I can save up for a year or two before moving out... I even said no to my old internship just so I can be at home. I think now I'd like to take the first decent job and leave. No finals or deadlines have ever put this much stress on me.

I have been looking for jobs online while watching Twitch streams or AFK on games on a separate monitor. My mom and dad would walk by and constantly harass me. My dad would start calling me a lowlife and failure while my mom would either stand there and stare at me until she get a reactions or drop a nasty glare. I have been home for TWO WEEKS going on three. These two weeks have been the worst part of my life in the past few years. How I feel about this can be found on my other post, but honestly I don't understand where all this come from. My dad literally told me ""you don't deserve respect from me because you have done nothing in you life."" I'm 22. In high school I dropped my social life and started working as a tutor just so I can earn money and watch my younger sister in the same place. For four years I did this. I never half-assed anything they expected me to do: school, take care of sister, and work. I got a scholarship to nice school for engineering, worked in-between, and graduated. Now that I'm home I can't even play a couple games while looking for a job. After the most recent scream match where my dad threatened to beat me if I kept ""playing games"" I literally sat in my chair with my head down sobbing listening to my mom cry about how I was tearing the family apart. I screamed until my voice was gone, I pleaded them to stop, I cried until my eyes could barely open, but I had no way of dealing with this stress. I just sat there with my head down and bit my lips because I had no idea how to stop my mom from crying and my dad yelling. After I literally tore my hair out and ran into my room. I locked the room and they were outside for a while, but it calmed. I feel bad for my sister who has to sleep on the couch, but I couldn't think of anything else. I had no idea home could be so bad. I remember two years ago, when I found out my girlfriend cheated on me, I felt so down and went so low that the only thing kept me from killing myself was the thought that ""it couldn't be worse than this.""

56,"So another weekend has passed, I spent it drinking annoying the few friends I have left in my hometown.

I have never been good at nurturing relations with people over time. After a while I lose interest and stop contacting them if I do not need them to be drinking buddies or somethinc similar.

This has given me a life of cykles, I meet a group of people I like, I go to deep and invest to much in it. This leads to burnout where I shut myself in and ignore phonecalls and messages, after a while peopleget tired of this and stop contacting me. And then my hypersocial side rears its head and I find new people.

Well this time it is not that easy. Since I moved to another city I have not made a single friend, workbuddies sure. But not friends.

59,"It was the summer of 2012. I was 20 going on 21 in just a little over a month. I had been out at friend Tom’s house who lived right behind me. We had a grilled some food with a few friends and just bullshitted for awhile. For some reason or another, I couldn’t shake this weird feeling in my gut. I can’t describe it, almost a light unsettling feeling. Around 9:45pm I ended up leaving because I couldn’t shake that feeling. 
I went home, walked to my room, rolled up a joint and went to my backyard. I lit up the joint, laid in the grass and just looked up and the night summer sky. 
There was a light breeze that just made me feel so relaxed. A few minutes of laying down my phone goes off, It’s my friend Chris asking me if I wanted to hang out and grab a 6 pack. I agreed and told him to come pick me up. About 10:30pm we took a drive to Calumet City, IL (a south suburb of Chicago) there was a liquor store we used to stop at and never get carded. We grabbed our beer and headed back to my backyard. We sat at a picnic table, drank our beer and listened to some music. At 11:30, we heard arguing from Tom’s house. It didn’t sound like much at first but then it got to a point where it sounded like it got serious. Chris and I went by my back gate to see what was going on. We seen Tom yelling at this “figure” that was dressed in black under the street light. The last words I heard from Tom were “if I see you here again I’m calling the police” the figure took a couple steps back, lifted up a hoodie, pulled out a gun and shot Tom once in the thigh and a second shot in the shoulder. Tom fell to the ground and this figure just walked away like nothing happened. I remember in that moment my brain couldn’t comprehend what my eyes saw. It was like I was in a daze, it felt fake but deep down I knew it was real. I turned my back and seen Chris hiding by the pool. I followed. I asked him “did we just really see this happen?” He replied “I think we did!”. I asked him if he wanted to go see what happened and he said yes. We took the short walk from my back only to see what looked like Tom laying in the grass in front of his house. I got closer and and I felt the blood rush from from my head and go right down to my feet. I got hit with this instant cold feeling. The breeze I felt earlier was gone. The flag hanging on the flag pole was completely still. No sounds around. It was in that moment I observed Tom, laying there, eyes still open, a light puddle of blood surrounding his lower body. I called 911 and told them what had happened. After I got off the phone I heard what would be Tom’s last breath. I knew he was gone but in that moment everything didn’t feel real.

69," 

Why do we judge ourselves solely on the lack of being in a relationship? So far I've dated two girls and thought I was close to dating another girl, who was a friend, before they started feeling cold towards me. But looking back they were all sociopaths, that might be a bit harsh saying that but they just were unstable or didn't care how I felt or my thoughts on stuff. I feel like I can't approach people in social situations, but after going to a few meetups I've been able to carry conversations pretty well. But more so I feel, or tell myself, I can't approach any woman I feel interested in because I'm probably already telling myself why would they be interested in a POS like me or my fear of being rejected, which I know there is a chance that it might happen or might not and I'm just overthinking it. I overthink everything, whether it's stuff about myself, past relationships or lack of, or if it's just my anxiety. I’m 26, I feel like I’m at that age that dating someone 5 years younger or older than me is weird. 

I search Reddit for self help or self care threads and nod my head in agreement and try to take some of the advice and apply it to my life but I feel like it gets me nowhere or I'm afraid to try it. I end up running around in a circle instead of the thread pumping myself up only to let myself down instead. 

I also tell myself everyone hates me, whether it's my close friends that I consider family, and have even I'm a brother to them, or people I just met. I feel like everyone is constantly judging me, and I tell myself they're not. If anything they're probably thinking about their own issues and problems. I've started to grow to the point that I can't approach my close friends with my problems now, just because of the toxic mindset I've developed. 

I feel like everyone hates anything I do. I've started to get more involved with photography. People have told me I'm pretty good and they my photos are amazing: I've had a friend approach me already to do a photo shoot with them in a few weeks. Or I make some stuff for my other hobbies and then show people I tell myself that it's not good enough or they secretly hate it. I basically bottle it up and just rant to my therapist.

I also feel like I can't relax either. If I'm at work I wish I was home, or when I'm at home I wish I was at work. Just to stay busy. I just can't seem to sit still anymore. I can't watch a movie without feeling like getting up and doing something else, or sitting on my PC. 

As for my job, I love my job it's pretty straight forward and pays well for only having a 2 year degree. However that's about all I like. I work 2nd shift, so I really don't see anyone, and I feel disconnected from the company or my coworkers. Basically I feel unmotivated because it's too straight forward or I have way too much downtime that I feel I could use for something better with my time. Plus I feel like I could be using my evenings going out and meeting people. Back when I tried OLD every time someone asked what I do I've be straightforward that I work evenings. Unsurprisingly they suddenly stop talking to me. Both girls I've dated were fine with me working evenings, but I felt back about it because I feel like I had to compete with their schedules or what they had plan for their weekends: them running errands and wanting to hangout with their friends, ect. 

I also feel like I can’t related to most people my age, outside of my friends cause I’ve grown to know them over the years. And this helps add to my problems of dating, I can try to talk about stuff from growing up in the 90s. But I’ve grown up as being a shut in, and it drives me crazy. I feel like I’m a introverted Extrovert, I’m shy but I always want to be around people. I’m a quiet person and I only voice my thoughts on stuff if I feel like I need to. But it feels weird standing there in a group without saying anything, but I’m listening instead of just randomly opening my mouth. I also feel like I do nothing from threaten people with my presence. I’m a big guy, I’m 6’6” and weigh around 265 lbs. I also have three looks on my face: the RBF/annoyed look, blank, or the “someone just kicked my dog” look. However I consider myself a teddy bear that just wants to get along and feel accepted by everyone. It’s that elephant vs mouse scenario. I’m the elephant but I’m afraid of anyone smaller than me.

I found that sitting on a computer every day looking at Reddit for hours on end just probably wasn’t very good for me. I think I need to spend my days doing more monumental things (that’s not to say that people who go on here don’t do anything, just particularly in my case I felt it was taking away the valuable things that I could do).

Another reason is just get my way of thinking in a good spot again. When it comes to being online, it usually takes a lot to get me riled up and I always try to avoid confrontation and stay positive for the most part. Although, I think I need to be blunt here when I say the things that I’m about to say. Reddit’s level of cynicism and it’s inability, in a lot of cases, to give people the benefit of the doubt is a problem and quite an impactful one at that. Some of the biggest pieces of shit that I have ever met have come from this website. Being on such an overall argumentative platform has not been healthy on my mental health or even my self-esteem or self-value in some cases.

About a month ago I found myself connecting with someone I vaguely knew from school. Went out to coffee a few times, had a nice chat or two. She seemed to have a lot of drama in her life relating to family, especially with her ex and her adult children... but everyone has something going on I figure.   


Last week she scheduled for us to meet up, and I was looking forward to it, and she canceled saying she was having a hard week and needed to rest. I was a bit disappointed but hey it happens. She rescheduled for a few days later, which was fine with me.   


Then she canceled again, claiming other related family stuff. Ok fine... Then about a half and hour later I get a message clearly intended for someone else with a completely different tone asking them if they wanted to get together.   


When I was younger, I would have let something like this slide. I get it, new friendship, and sometimes people want to hang with old friends. Today I see this as a red as hell flag, especially for a friendship thats so new.   


I think about all the drama she told me about, some she claimed responsibility for but she also assigned blame and made judgements regarding other people. I try to keep in mind when I hear stuff like that it's only one side of the story. I can understand  not wanting to go out, I don't want to go out... but when I make a commitment to someone I intend to keep it, because that's the whole point of trying to connect with people in the first place. I made time for her twice, and she blew me off twice, and now I know it was clearly for no good reason other than wanting to spend time with other people.   


I'm not angry really, just disappointed. I feel a little bad for cutting her out of my life, she clearly wants to make new friends too... but I'm putting myself and my needs first. We teach people how to treat us. I know I can and have let people slide and get away with stuff like this in the past towards me, and I didn't let it bother me even if it inconvenienced me. Now though, before this little friendship gets started I'm ending it. If I'm getting shit like this now when I've only been hanging with her a couple of times. what is the future going to look like with her in my world?

This was the closest thing I had to the Ulysses bucketlist girl I read about on reddit and that really switched me on to people from the past that affected me in a profound way.

She had no idea about this because I remember messaging her out of the blue and her being genuinely surprised I remembered her.

Part of me still has that crush on that girl. How do people let go of the past so well? Or do they not and they just look like they have?",24Feb2019,2

77,"Everyone knows and is quick to say that life isn't fair. I agree with this too. But why be okay with it? So much privilege or lack thereof is assignes at birth and it makes a huge difference in our lives. For those of us who got dealt shit hands I don't see why we shouldn't fold. I'm ugly as hell and I didn't get to choose. I'm sick of how it effecta my life amd how much easier it is for attractive people. I don't care if saying this makes me a bitch: I want it easy too. Or at least not so damn hard. I don't want to live a life where O may be treated differently based on something I have no conteol over. I don't understand how I can live a life like this and be okay with it. I've cared a lot about fairness since I was young. This world obviously isn't for me.

79,"I’ve been thinking about this a lot and it once worried me, but hey, I’m vaccinated, and the logical people I’m surrounded with who I care about are vaccinated, too. I’m safe. 

People who don’t vaccinate, well, stupid games win stupid prizes. I don’t feel bad if they die from some preventable disease, because they’re on the level of Christian scientists who don’t believe in medical treatment for easily treatable issues. 

My mom’s Friend was born to some of those people. When she was little and sleeping on the bottom of a bunk bed, the top bunk fell and crushed her skull. She was unconscious for D A Y S. Her parents let her lay in bed in a coma, aware that she might die, because “God” would handle it and allowing man-made medical treatment would be going against God’s will. Can you say natural selection? Come the fuck on. Now she suffers cognitive disfunction and terrible depth perception, probably because it fell on the back of her head near the occipital lobe. 

Everyone is worried about the future of impending overpopulation. Well, maybe this will take care of that. Weed out the idiots in a way that won’t harm those who had enough self preservation to vaccinate themselves and their kids. I wish there were laws that considered not vaccinating your child as child abuse or endangerment, or even a threat to society as a whole, so that only the adults who can consent to not getting vaccinated suffer from their idiotic decisions. It sucks that unaware children with no control over their bodies or health are subjected to the risks of disease and death from their parents’ stupidity. 

I’m pissed off and writing this based on the French family that brought Measles to Costa Rica, a country that managed to eradicate the disease for the last five years. Why don’t these fucking people look at countries where there are little to no vaccinations and observe the havoc that these preventable illnesses inflict on those who cannot vaccinate themselves. These people are despicable. ",24Feb2019,4

2-Death by North Korean nuke.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to start by thanking you for reading this. 

I'm 23M and I feel like every time I have to get up from bed to go to work, I really don't want to. I suffer from depression (with suicidal thoughts every now and then) and know how that affects my well-being, but been able to live with it up until now, without any type of medication cause I really don't want to start taking pills or any of the sort. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just consider myself so f-ing lazy lately but no matter what, every attempt to change how I handle my life is unsuccessful. I also suffer from social anxiety and although I can have conversations with my coworkers and minimum amount of friends, I then want to step away from any social contact (maybe because I'm also an introvert, or at least it seems so).   


It is known that the only person who can really change your life is you, but it's been so hard lately. When I want to go outside for a walk, something happens and start coming up with pretexts to the point I change my mind and just want to lay down on my bed and sleep. I've also noticed that I have these 'spikes' when I want to actually do stuff and be productive, but then I'm back again to not feeling like doing nothing, at most, watching tv or playing videogames. Idk but it's like as I grow older, my desire to be someone fades away. I want to set goals for my life, but I'm afraid I might not be strong enough to reach them... (sigh)

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I think that's all I want to tell for now. Bye :)

88,"So my mother sells products on the line of CBD. I agree that it has health benefits. I use marijuana for my anxiety, it's helped me a lot since I have been taking it and I don't have emotional outbursts as much. Anyway. My mom goes on live streams a lot to promote her business and I was notified by a family member that she went live and talked about my family's mental health. A couple years back I was hospitalized for suicidal tendencies and she posted about it online and people I didn't even know what weren't part of my family knew that I had a mental illness. I didn't want her to do that and I was upset when it did happen and when I told her I wanted her to take it down she said I was being selfish. Now like I said I am fine with CBD and all that it does, I love the plant. She talked about me, my father, and my sister. My father had past anxiety attacks and suicidal thoughts. My sister has been to the hospital twice now for suicidal tendencies. She mentioned that they both take antidepressants but since they have been taking the CBD they take them on and off. With my experience with antidepressants my doctors have strictly told me that it is not healthy or safe to do this as it could further cause problems with my mental health. My sister is a few years younger than me and so I'm worried that she might be affected by this sooner or later. Anyway, my mother talked about their mental health but every other sentence was about CBD. My family members have also said that it looks like she is trying to just promote her business. My mother lied about my sisters current mental health and my mother is quite... Emotionally abusive.. I will give an example. My sister got in a fight with my parents and messaged her friend that lives right across the street that she needed a break. (She's an angsty teen right now and I was like that when I was her age(and this was recent as of a month ago)) So my father takes her phone and reads the text allowed to my mother and my mother said that she was going to call the police and have her removed. I had quite a few incidents like this. My father even said he was going to call someone one time and have me put up for adoption. I really don't know what to do.  I don't know how far my mother will go to break my sister down like she did me. I don't know how much more she is going to exploit my sisters. The internet is a scary place.. my parents are too..

91,"Apologies for the long post. There's a bit of back story. Before you suggest it, I'm already in therapy and have been going for years.

It all began when I was a junior in college. I entered into a new relationship and things were pretty good for about two years. After about two years, things took a turn for the toxic. I didn't realize it at the time, but we were in a seriously codependent relationship with virtually no boundaries. She suffered from chronic severe mental illness and was hospitalized. I overextended myself by putting myself in the position of a caretaker. Eventually, I grew to resent her. The calls at 2am of her just crying into the phone. The arguments about why I was holding off from getting engaged. It was terrible. After a lot of therapy, I was able to break things off with her just before our fourth anniversary.

Things improved a bit. I started dating again after a few months. I wasn't taking it very seriously and slept around a lot. After about a year of that, I felt ready to take dating seriously. I got in shape and tried to make myself as attractive a mate as possible. Things took a turn for the worse. I wasn't able to date anyone for longer than a few weeks before they broke things off with me. This happened repeatedly. It wore me down. It ruined any fragile sense of confidence that I had. 

After a few years of this, I met a woman where everything just clicked perfectly. The kind of person who makes you want to be a better person. I was totally smitten. Things were going amazing for about three months... Then she left me for another man. I was completely crushed. I ran into the arms of a female friend and we ended up having sex. Things got really bad after that. She began to verbally abuse me and threatened to kill herself if I broke things off with her. I called the cops. They got there in time. I blocked her on everything. That was almost a year ago. Since then, I've been more or less been completely closed off from women.

I'm so lonely. I'm almost thirty and I feel like I've totally lost hope of ever being in a happy and healthy relationship. I've been going to therapy for over five years and I haven't found a resolution yet. My therapist suggested that I  may be suffering from post-traumatic stress. I know I'm not ready to be with someone until I work out this mess, but in the meantime, I'm so lonely.

I'd appreciate some kind words. 

TL;DR: I've been through a number of traumatic experiences and I'm currently stuck on a never-ending emotional merry-go-round where I feel sad and lonely and then I think about dating and it makes me feel angry and frustrated so I end up back at sad and lonely. My therapist suggested that I may be suffering from post-traumatic stress.",24Feb2019,12
93,"If feel comfortable around them. Knowing that I have absolutely positively no chance with them makes it easier to relate to their personalities as there is no male/female back and forth and hidden expectations. That's not to say that I don't like hetero girls, I do. But I can deal with a lesbian as a completer equal with no hidden agenda on her part or mine.

Also, I could't imagine having sex with another male.  If I were female, I wouldn't date any of the guys I know., either.

Does this make sense.",24Feb2019,11
