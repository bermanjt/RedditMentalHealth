0,"You write on my heart and you pretend not to know it. I hurt today. Ive been in such agony and pain. My life has changed. Before the trip I had a premonition and I didn‚Äôt listen. I wish I would have know that everything was about to change. Maybe its all for the better. Maybe I will never know. Maybe I will never know. Maybe I will never know. 

Like kayaking down the rapids alone, I float on down the river wishing you were there to guide me still. Im forced to walk alone. More alone then I have ever been before. Maybe your spirit will still haunt me. Maybe my delusions and unthinkable nightmares will come to fruition. They seem to hunt me down and pummel me when I‚Äôm at my lowest. This life has kicked me in the teeth more times then should ever be allotted. Why must my path always be the hardest. Why cant I have a simple and wonderful time of it? I guess its up to me to change all this but how do you untangle a spiders web? How does one breath through lungs that are broken? Never once have I truly had anyone love me. Maybe I am not worthy. Maybe I am just a delusional mental case that believes in fairytales and magical moments that possibly never really happened. Maybe my imagination is more then even I can handle. Maybe I wasn‚Äôt made for this time or this world. Maybe this really is hell. Maybe I was just meant to be tortured the entire way through this life.  Who‚Äôs next, step right up, the freak show needs another lashing. Maybe I will win the lotto, lay in the warm grass and we will float on. Maybe I am just a dreamer with nothing but a dream, a broken soul, a shattered heart, an old memory of when time stood still and you watched me from the window sill.",06Jul2019,1
1,"This was burning a hole through my brain and I just had to say it. 

Ok so I‚Äôm in the marine corps. I don‚Äôt think anyone can argue otherwise when I say the marine corps has some of the strictest appearance/ uniform/ appeal rules of all the other branches. 

Our appearance both on and off duty is highly regulated. There‚Äôs some things that are prohibited which are tbh just American things (for example wearing tank tops) idk I just think it‚Äôs funny because that‚Äôs probably one of the most American things you could wear. 

Anyways. There‚Äôs one thing in particular that I find hilarious. I‚Äôm the list of things we are NOT allowed to wear (civilian attire) is ‚Äúshort shorts‚Äù (not that anyone would want to wear em anyway) yet, we regularly wear PT uniform which have some ridiculous short shorts. Like when I first came to boot camp i was like ‚Äúthis has got to be some kind of sexual shit‚Äù because my effin shorts were so short and my effin thighs were beefy asf. My exact reaction was ‚Äúwhat the actual fuck‚Äù

I want surgery because I‚Äôm not anyone‚Äôs first choice. There‚Äôs a girl at my university who‚Äôs signed to a big modeling agency. No man on earth would choose me over her. I don‚Äôt want someone to settle for me because they can‚Äôt get a hotter girl. How could a man be satisfied with me when there are literal supermodels out there? I just want to be someone‚Äôs dream girl. 

Sure, personality counts, but not really. Leonardo DiCaprio doesn‚Äôt exclusively date 20 year old blonde models for their amazing personalities. No one cares about personality when you‚Äôre ugly. When guys cold approach girls or buy them drinks they don‚Äôt know her personality. 

People always say that too much surgery makes you look fake, but I think most guys like the fake look. Not to sound all r/nicegirls, but it‚Äôs the instagram models with fake everything that get flown out to exotic places, expensive gifts, and thousands of men drooling over them, not the plain janes. 

So, I‚Äôm currently in college studying comp sci so I can find a high paying job and save money for my surgeries. I‚Äôm sick of feeling invisible, ugly, and unwanted. I want to be someone‚Äôs first choice. I want to be showered with attention and bought gifts just for existing. None of that will happen until I get surgery.",06Jul2019,7

About 2 years ago I‚Äôve noticed that if I have maybe 3 beers and eat something specially a good size meal, my stomach will have a tough time digesting everything to the point that i will get violently sick (blood pressure drops, feeling like passing out, diarrhea at times etc) and will only get better after vomiting or passing a stool. I happens nearly every single time (specially when socializing) and I‚Äôve come to terms that I can no longer drink. What makes it weird is how I can however come home from work, have maybe two beers (or a glass of wine) before dinner and be just fine. I‚Äôve brought it up with my doctor and he basically said just stop drinking.

There has been no major life changes that I can think of but I do have a little bit of social anxiety so I wonder if that makes it worse.

It gives me the suspicion that he's actually the strongest candidate and someone is sewing dissent amongst democrats to keep him from gaining traction with the young adult demographic.

But then, nobody is saying much about Bernie and that group is *loud* so maybe it's just too early for the actual participants to begin speaking up in earnest.

22,"Hi everyone so I am just done. I feel as if I wasted the best years of my life doing something so dumb I can't stand life anymore. Last summer my group of friends started hanging out with this group of girls and one of them was interested in dating me. I decided not to date her because I was to busy with my business and saw that she was dating a new guy every month and I didn't just want to be just another guy. (BTW she was dating a lot for emotional reasons and not sex)

When I was a kid I was very lonely and didn't have many friends. I was bullied for how I acted and how I looked. I was always pushed around in life and never had the confidence to do anything. When I got into high school I decided to take a stand to this bullshit and started building a business. I worked so hard to build my business and was so obsessed that when something wouldn't go right I would want to end my own life. Now at the end of my senior year my business makes about 60k a year in passive income and I will probably make 100k a year passively in the next couple of years. This would sound great to the old me and to many others but honestly I feel fucking stupid.

Since freshman year I dreamed that senior year would be amazing. I would have a beautiful girlfriend and I could take her to homecoming and prom and have the kind of relationship I would see in the movies. My dream was so big but I felt my hard work could make something like this come true. Well honestly it did and thats what the problem is. The girl that I decided to pass up over the summer started dating a guy that she continued dating all school year up until today. Throughout the school year I had to watch them have the kind of senior year I have always wanted. Now that high school is over I feel like a huge failure. I chased money when I had the perfect girl in front of me the whole time who didn't care about my money or looks and liked me for me. Something much better than anything I could have dreamed of. Sadly I had to watch this die in front of my eyes. I can't believe how stupid I am. I wake up every morning in utter regret for what I have done. Each day gets worse as I think about what could have been to the point where I don't want to live anymore.

More than anything in the world I want to feel love. I want to fall deeply in love with a girl and care about her more than anything. I feel as if I finally took a stand to this cold world and was pushed down farther than I was before. I was once full of hope for the future and excited for what could be and now I am completely hopeless. This girl is going to the same community college as me next year and I just hope that I will get another chance then to make up for what I should have done in the past. I care about her so much it makes me sick. I just feel like I will never find something like this again in my life or will have able to have the same happiness from it. I would really appreciate some advice on what to do and how to forgive myself for my past. Thanks so much!",06Jul2019,1

25,"So... one of my closest friends died in February. I don't let very many people get close to me, so it was a big deal that we got close. We talked about everything, and he still had so much more to teach me. Most days are getting easier, but there are still days where that despair reappears, and I remember that I will never see or talk to my beloved friend again.

&amp;#x200B;

I was talking to a friend tonight about spirituality. A bit of a backstory of myself: I got really, really into spirituality a couple of years ago. When I got sober, the spirituality pretty much disappeared and I'm very skeptical now. I'd LOVE to believe in spirituality, as it was so rewarding for me, but I'm not there right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was talking to my friend tonight, I remembered a conversation that I had with my friend before he died (about spirituality).  My dead friend was also sober and also used psychedelics when he was still using drugs. 

&amp;#x200B;

One time we got into a conversation about spirituality and acid. I naturally, like the skeptic I currently am, expressed my grief for my experiences on acid not being real. My dead friend told me he had a lot of experiences with acid and that we'd have to talk about it sometime. He died a couple of weeks later. Looking back on it (especially now that I have quite a few of his books), I realize he could've spiritually enlightened me, and probably could have validated these spiritual experiences. I wish we could've had that conversation with him. Honestly I wish I could have any spiritual conversations with him. I really had more to learn from him, and it hurts so bad. He was one of the smartest people I've ever met, and I could just tell that man had some deep wisdom about life.

26,"As the title suggests, I‚Äôve had my life turn a complete 180 on me and today it really hit me emotionally.

I moved to another town with my fianc√© for his new job so he could get experience in his field. It pays well so I didn‚Äôt mind making the move for him, there isn‚Äôt much in this town as it is very small and very different to where I‚Äôm from (city). 

I had been working multiple jobs where I used to live too so I saw it as a break for me as well from a routine I had for a long time. I gave myself a week off, and then the week after we packed our things and moved. Very soon I landed a job in this new town, which I was very excited about and felt lucky that I got a job so quickly. 

However, this new job is absolutely hectic and after two days of training I despise it. At first I thought it was just because I have to learn everything again and coming from a job I used to have for years and was very good at, feeling like the new kid again isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôve done in a really long time. The work environment there is also not good, everyone looks at me like I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing and it‚Äôs very daunting. Today I was hit with more shifts added to my work schedule that I did NOT request and this new boss put me working every day. 

I had a complete melt down and everything hit me at once. The fact that I‚Äôm away from my friends and family for the first time, I‚Äôm in a completely different town and I don‚Äôt know anyone, I haven‚Äôt even explored the whole area and don‚Äôt even know where things are located, and work being thrown at me all has made me realize how unadjusted I am. I have been living in this new place for 2 weeks and I feel so overwhelmed. 

I panicked and told my boss that I had a family emergency and needed to leave for a while and he has not responded, which I guess isn‚Äôt surprising since I only worked 2 shifts but kind of raises a red flag about what kind of boss he is too. 

I feel horrible for letting an opportunity go to waste and I feel overwhelmed with how new everything is to me. I feel very out of place in this environment.

29,"I posted this a while back in r/offmychest but wanted to share here because educating your children and having a good relationship with your children because you just don't know when it might save them.

\---------------------------------

I was in the 8th grade. Puberty hit and gifted me with a nice hourglass figure.

Looking back at how it all started, it was like a movie - sneaky, contrived, manipulative.

We had a swimming pool and often invited family and friends over for a swim. This aunt and uncle would bring their kids over for a swim sometimes. Side note - He's an uncle through a few marriages, but not blood related. His kids were my age. His son had a crush on me. I'd wear a one piece swimsuit and catch him staring but as an 8th grader, I was naive and didn't think anything of it.

Our family went on camping trips with their family. During one trip in particular, he found a time to approach me and wanted a ""closer look"" at the necklace I was wearing. It was a silver necklace with a cross pendant. He'd come close and grab the pendant and rest his forearm against my breast. I was uncomfortable, but didn't say anything. Why would I? He was just looking at my necklace. But he was actually testing to see how close he could get to me.

He was a mechanic and he offered to do a check up on my parent's cars. We stopped by his workplace one day and while other mechanics were talking to my parents, he again came to get a ""closer look"" at my necklace and make casual conversation with me.

He asked me questions about where I went to school and what time I get home, my daily schedule etc. You see, I was also a latchkey child...left home alone for a few hours while my parents were working. It was almost too perfect of a situation for him. I was the perfect victim.

The day it happened....my dad dropped me off at home from school. Only shortly after that, my uncle knocks on my front door and asked if he could come in a use our phone. It was 1995, we didn't have cell phones. Of course I let him in. I was using a digital type writer for one of my class assignments. At this point, I started feeling suspicious about what he was doing. I brought the type writer and placed it next to me on the sofa while I sat at the very end - this way, he couldn't come over to sit next to me.

At that very moment, I remember deciding in my mind, ""if he does anything to me, I'll elbow him in the chest like this."" As soon as that thought passed through my mind, he put the phone down and said, ""no one picked up. I'll try again in a little bit."" He walked over, moved the type writer over and sat down next to me on my right. I wasn't sure what he was going to do next.

With his right hand, he reached over, grabbed my left breast and asked ""can I touch this?""

Without even thinking, I elbowed him in his chest as hard as I could and screamed at the top of my lungs, ""Get the fuck out of my house!"" and ran to the front door to open it for him.

He freaked out so bad and begged if he could use the phone again. I don't know why I let him this second time, but I did. I could see he was thinking about what to do next. Finally he steps out of the house and my last words to him were, ""I'm going to tell my parents."" I saw the fear wash over his face and as he tried to bargain with me. ""NO please don't te-"" I slammed the door in his face.

Thinking back...he could have really hurt me, but I think God was on my side that day.

I ran to my parent's bedroom, locked the door behind me and got on the phone to call my mom. The only words I could utter before bawling to her was, ""mom? Uncle was here..."" and she said, ""which uncle?"" and once I told her the name, she knew all the possibilities that could have happened and asked, ""what did he do to you?""

That uncle then called me on the phone and I didn't even let him talk, and just hung up. He called back twice.

When my dad came home, I had never seen him so distraught in my life. There were so many things running through his head. Many phone calls were made that night. I had a very close relationship with my parents. They knew me well and knew that I wouldn't ever make up a story like that - it wasn't in my nature. They didn't question if I was lying. They could read it all over my face and in my withdrawing body language.

Some people didn't believe me. Some were convinced I was making it all up because it was his words against mine, an adult verses a child. I had another uncle who was a police officer. He talked to me and asked all the details, but because there was no actual sexual act, we couldn't prove it. We never pressed charges.

A few weeks later, the pedophile uncle moved their family as far away as he could to the East Coast to start their life over. (We were in California)

A few months after that, one of his victims (another family member) came to me and shared her story. She said her family never believed her and she just had to live with it. She had been his victim for so many years and was so proud of me for doing something about it because it probably stopped him from hurting other young girls.

While they were on the East Coast, he overcompensated with acts in his life to cover up any residual rumors by becoming the president of the men's ministry in his church and even an elder. He placed himself in an untouchable role in the community to extinguish anything from his past.

Over twenty some years later, I saw him again at a funeral. He kept staring at me. Still a creep. Caught him video recording me and his other victim. But people in the community don't forget that kind of thing when a strange face just shows up again.

I later learned that before they moved to the East Coast, his wife quite literally kicked him in the balls.

Today, I'm proud of myself because I know it stopped him from hurting at least one other person. Perhaps it prevented him from hurting others. At least he'll have the memory of his life falling apart because of his actions and poor decisions.

A Severe Battle With Severe Sadness 3

When I begin to suspect my family hates me I must be in a steep downtrend.

For all of my childhood and teenage years I've been alone. I don't blame anybody, I wouldn't be friends with myself either. I'm hateful and unpleasant to be around. Anxious, weird, uncomfortable, and awkward. I think into things too much and I authentically believe I'm superior and don't listen to people. This is complete crap, but deep down for some reason I've gotten myself to believe so many delusions that I can hardly even point my eyes directly in front of me and see what is actually happening.

So things start sucking. Parents divorce. My brother, an at-one-point overachiever that I looked up to, develops a serious mental illness and turns into a shut-in.
I start failing at everything I do, even elementary school classes. I grow increasingly ignorant about my environment as I consume myself with video games every waking second I possibly can. That's all I want. Video games, video games, video games. Useful and interesting information in school? No, video games! Making friends and developing social skills? No, video games! Hanging out with one of my few remaining friends? No, cut them off and get to the computer! The day I turned 16 I dropped out of high school, the earliest I believed I legally could. For the next few years I obsessively played 15-30 hour sessions 7 days per week. My Mom is God-knows-where with her new boyfriend. My Dad is God-knows-where in the midst of destroying his career. My older brother's condition continues to decline, yet he's neglected. My younger brother has been moved with Dad to a poorly-off neighborhood and gets into drugs.

My family is completely apart. We weren't ever too close to begin with, but now everybody is solidified in their role of in-the-middle-of-fucking-nowhere-doing-nothing-good. I'm without anybody, nor did I want anybody. Things are terrible but I can't hear my internal rage, hatred, sadness, loneliness, ignorance, and isolation over the sounds of these fun video games!

Well I'm 21 now, a few years after being in the depths of that hell. A hell I fully embraced with open arms. My life, I felt, has started. Not in the sense of having a life, because I don't. I'm still severely fucked up in an unbelievable amount of ways. There are things I am thankful for, but those thoughts can be easily overpowered. When you use video games as a band-aid to not realize what your life is, then you take away the obsessive video game playing with efforts to look at a better future, there seems to be endless harsh realities, truths, damages, pain, anger, emotions, and feelings that pile on and pile on and pile on that are not suppressed any longer. And I'm the catalyst of it all. And these feelings come strong and often and it is not explainable. Things can really pile up.",06Jul2019,1
38,So this happened last night and I feel really bad about it. I live on a farm and have two housecats. One of them likes to go outside a lot. Yesterday I let him outside and he got hit by a vehicle on the road. I know it's not directly my fault and no one is blaming me for it but I still feel like I killed him and it makes it so much worse. I just feel so bad for him. And now my other cat doesn't have her friend to be with. She must be so confused and sad.,06Jul2019,2
39,"My parents have worked very hard to raise me. They have given me everything I've ever wanted,all my life. When I was young they didn't have a lot of money but not once did they ever let me miss out on anything. Over the years my parents became well off. My parents gave me all the best education, all the best things. But that's not what the problem is. The problem is me. I'm a loser. I'm a worthless ,piece of shit who can't help herself overcome everything. I see people having fun,I can't even keep friends. I loathe myself. I despise myself. I hate the fact that my parents never had a another child because at least then they would've had a backup for me. I dont smoke or drink. I don't have an addiction . In fact I have nothing. No life,to be exact. I just sit around and go to college. I struggled extremely hard in high school academically. And I tried my best to get into a great college. So did my parents. But I had to settle for one far away from home because that's the only one that was good. I left home to attend college,and I left my parents alone,and I have never forgiven myself for that. And I probably never will. I made a promise to myself that college would be different from high school. That I wouldn't let anyone walk all over me. But I still struggle everyday. I wouldn't say I'm depressed. I've never been diagnosed and I'm no doctor. But I have no passion for life. I'm scared of it all. People deserve what I've been given. I'm not worth all this. And I know thaty parents gave me 100% of them,but I can't give it all back. I'm scared I'll end up like this 10 years later,scared and lonely. And I don't wanna live feeling like a failure all the time. But with that same feeling becomes an enormous amount of guilt. How can I think of killing myself and ruining my parents life like that? Destroying everything they have ever worked for. I may deserve shit all but they don't.

41,"Im so excited. I have begun my life style change the beginning of this year. Down 20 lbs. Wanted to excercise more but couldn't go outside because of toxic relationship. Not that he told me I couldn't, but knew it wouldn't end well if I did. Broke up with him a week ago, and started walking around the neighborhood. 1.5 miles a day, first 3 days. Fourth day, 3.67, trying to get water. Got some pretty gnarly blisters on my heels but after 3 days of rest, they are healed enough that I'm confident I can go for walks again. Now back to my 1.5, maybe 2 miles a day. My life is changing, for the better, I feel it in my bones. Im excited, for my daughters and myself. Took me a long time to love my body and myself, even longer to show my body and myself the love it deserves. I cannot wait to pass this feeling onto my daughters. I cannot wait to walk again.",06Jul2019,1
42,"I honestly just need to vent, figured this would just be a decent place to do it.

I have been driving about 3 years now. I am 30 years old. Between a mixture of an abusive father instilling a fear of driving, in me, and not being able to afford a car until a few years ago, I didn't get my license until I was 27/28. I mostly carpooled or got rides from friends/family.

I drive every day now, though, and consider myself mostly good at it. I even drive for a living. I work as a Forklift operator at a winery half an hour's commute from my house via the freeway (California). Today I got off of the freeway, on the exit for my house, and took a right on red. I didn't see a guy coming from opposing traffic, since he was in my blind spot. Naturally he blamed me for the incident, despite my wife's reassurance that the guy would have had ample time to see me and react. So we collided. Nothing major, my lights and stuff still work, I just have a nice beautiful dent on my fender of the car I own, to remind me of it. I know time will heal the wound and I feel better than I did after the accident, but I feel like an emotional trainwreck. All I wanted was to come home. I was tired from work, I get up at 5am every weekday to commute half an hour to work, work an 8 hour shift and drive 30 mins home. I was exhausted, ready to go home and relax, have a Sam Adams and start my weekend off right. Instead I got to sit in 90+ degree weather, waiting on CHP to come file an accident report while an old guy complains about it being my fault and generally trying to make me feel like a piece of shit.

So now, I get to spend my weekend with the fact my insurance will call me on Monday leaning over my head, to find out whether or not I am liable for this shit. Sorry for the rambling. Odds are nobody is gonna read this, but I am sick of keeping it inside..",06Jul2019,7
43,"My boyfriend and I live together with my mother. He has a job and is unsure of what career he wants. That‚Äôs fine, I have no expectations or desire to force him.

44,"There was this trust fund kid who decided to open a bar. He opened this bar several years ago. 

His background, his dad is a real-estate mogul worth who when he passed away gave his wealth to his son. His son (who isn't a complete idiot, but not completely interested in being in real-estate) hired a company to manage his real-estate holdings for him. 

Then he opened up a bar cause he always wanted to have a bar. His bar was legitimately fun. He was a charismatic bar tender, setup a good atmosphere etc. Then he started ripping people off.

I started noticing he'd rip me off. I stopped going, he was also ripping off many of my friends. Example you'd be there all night, and your bill should be $100, he'd tell you its $150. Or he'd ask you if you want a shot, you'd say sure, he'd add your shot, and his shot to your tab even though he kinda implied it was on the house.

Anyway people stopped going there.

And word started to spread. 

I heard for many years his bar wasn't profitable and he was pumping money into it to keep it going. He also had a great location, and some really decent food (until he pissed off his cook, who quit on him)

But word begin to spread, and eventually the word got so negative that people just stopped coming. In fact when new people would come into town, many people would warn them ""hey don't go here, the owner will rip you off"" and thats how his bar became known, as the place where the owner rips people off. 

Well long story short he finally closed shop! He was a another local watering hole at the bar with a few customers flanking him (not with him, they were there when he came in) and he was saying ""I've not had any customers all money, its not worth it to me to keep the bar open...I just don't understand why people stopped coming to my bar""

And we all laughed, and the bar owner (at the bar he was at) said ""Maybe you shouldn't have ripped off all your customers"" he left...last I checked he had moved out of the area and appears to have more direct role in his real-estate holdings. Maybe he'll be a better property manager then bar owner.",06Jul2019,4

Anyway, our class made a goodbye party because we graduated, my friends were not going but I said ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù and went anyway and it was great, honestly it was not the best party and thankfully it ended early, but I was scared of not fitting in or people thinking I was boring, but it turned out fine, I got along with everyone and they said they‚Äôll invite me to their next party.

They gave me a number of punishments, but one of them was my dad removing the door from my room. I know, it sounds funny.

I briefly mentioned that she came with a couple of her friends. Well, at the show the 3 of us hung out pretty much the entire time, and even though I have really bad social anxiety that makes it extremely difficult to be out and about without wanting to die when I get home, they made me feel very safe and comfortable. At the end of the show we all agreed we would see each other again and hang out soon.  


Just a few days later they invited to a 4th of July party. The party consisted of me and 6 other of their friends. Together we just sat on the floor of the apartment and listened to music while getting drunk.  


Before heading there and seeing them all, I was getting really anxious again. Same thing happened at the show too. It's a feeling that's all too familiar with any kind of social gathering I go to - I get really anxious in the minutes leading up to the time I'm suppose too see someone(s) and I chicken out at the last minute. But when they opened the door to the apartment, and I saw how kind and sweet they all were, even the people who I hadn't even met yet, I felt safe. Each of them opened their arms to me and gave me a hug.  


I arrived there at 9:00pm and all of us stayed there until 3:00am. The girl I have a huge crush on (The same girl I kissed at the show) rested her head in my lap. I didn't want to leave, and they told me they didn't want me to leave either and that I was free to sleep there if I wanted to. But I told my parents that I was too be home by 12:00am, and even though I regularly checked in with them I knew they wouldn't be too happy staying out that late.  


I'm 20 years old, and I haven't had a steady group of friends since I was 14, and they all drifted apart from each other throughout high school. Now barely anyone speaks to each other anymore. I know this is probably nothing too important of a life event for anyone, but for me it's very it's very special. My anxiety has kept me from having the guts to make new friends and meet new people. Before I met them, I was very depressed and confused. Now I'm at the happiest point in my life I've been in for years. I'm seeing the girl I have a crush on and her friend in a couple days and together we're going to have a jam session and try to play songs from the band we saw at the concert where we met.",06Jul2019,24
57,"TL;DR finally stopped walking around eggshells with my friend and told him how he really broke my heart when he convinced everyone to turn against me.

Some time ago, I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/9ztaaw/heartbroken_after_seeing_old_friends_throw_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) about how hurtful it was seeing my ex friends throwing a friendsgiving and looking so happy without me. They became my ex friends because one of my friends (aka X from the post) made up a rumor about me and everyone believed it. That friend who I referred to as X has apologized to me and we‚Äôve been building our friendship back. Over the course of 6-7 months we‚Äôve gotten closer than ever. However there‚Äôs always been a lot of distrust in the back of my mind...

Yesterday we were at a pool party celebrating the 4th when X invited one of the people kind of associated in that rumor-drama. I haven‚Äôt been around that group of people in a long time so seeing her there was kind of alarming. I said hi (kinda awkward) but still just had my fun and did my thing. When it was time to go I had to give X a ride home. Once we get to his place, I really let out how I‚Äôve been feeling deep down over the past several months regarding our friendship. What I went through in the midst of the drama was truly heartbreaking. One by one everyone cut me off, unfollowed me, and started talking about me. I turned into some bad guy over night... for literally no reason. I was just so lonely I relapsed on self harm. Last night I told him all this and how seeing her was triggering back to those times. I said I forgave him but I can‚Äôt act like I completely trust him.

65,"I have endometriosis. In case you don't know what that is, it's a condition where the lining of the uterus grows outside the reproductive system and invades other body parts, causing internal bleeding, extreme pain, adhesions between body parts, and more. It took nine years of me begging my doctors to take me seriously to finally find someone who listened. I had my first surgery in February and things were worse than we anticipated. Several organs were completely bound in place by adhesions, there were large lesions on numerous parts of my body, and so on. They cut everything out. Recovery was horrible. I remember crying that I didn't understand how a human could handle that much pain without dying. 

After recovery things were better again for a while, but then it got bad again. I have been in such immense pain lately that I've been mostly bed bound, unable to even eat. My surgeon called me in for a follow up because of the increase in symptoms, and ran an ultrasound. Unfortunately we got the worst result possible. Both my ovaries are completely stuck to my uterus by adhesions and I have a large (4.8 cm, 5 cm is usually surgically removed) hemorrhagic cyst (the painful, bloody kind, not the harmless kind.) 

I was given two options.

A) live with the pain and sacrifice ever having kids, because pregnancy stretching the uterus would tear my ovaries. 

B) have another surgery, and just hope it doesn't happen again, which it can. 

My fiancee and I get married in October. Less than a week ago we decided that after the wedding we want to start trying for a baby. We were so excited. I've never wanted kids because of my finances, and now that I feel comfortable to try the prospect of dropping the idea feels like a knife to the heart. I opted to have surgery again, but their first date available was the week before my wedding. We pushed it back to mid November. That's going to be two surgeries in less than a year, and I'm terrified. 

After we left the office my fiancee tried to help keep my mind off things. He took me to my favorite restaurant and we went shopping for some wedding decor. But now that I'm laying here in silence and can't sleep I'm really struggling with this.

There are no divides over ""you should do this because you're a man/woman"". After just reading a thread in which people were talking about the expectations people have of their partners bases on their gender, I've realised that this isn't as common as you'd think.

I just thought I'd post it so people realise that it is possible. When my boyfriend doesn't work, we split the housework and baby duties equally. He's an amazing and playful dad, but does the nitty gritty like changing nappies and helping with midnight wakefulness. I'm back to working part-time after having the baby, but I'm in a much higher paid job than him so we can split costs equally for bills, holidays and fun things. And importantly, he completely supports me in my career and is proud of my successes, which others in the past weren't able to do. Sometimes he'll be struggling financially and I'll help him out, and he's done the same for me particularly during the last months of my maternity leave. Sometimes he'll carry my bags if they're heavy and sometimes I'll make him a sandwich on his lunch break or cook when he comes back from a long shift, but we know that we're doing it out of love, not because our partner requires us to do so. I'll mow the grass and he'll redecorate the living room. We share it all.

I havent gone one day just being selfish, doing what I want, pursuing what I desire, building my own confidence from within.

Prior to the relationship I definitely didnt consider myself lonely. Now, while in a relationship, I do. 

We had a huge fight yesterday and I realized once more, that I wouldnt have anybody if I didnt have them. This is not healthy. Especially because atm we arent as happy and content as before. Our sex life isn‚Äôt fulfilling me. We dont talk as often about other things than work. I am very emotionally invested, so whenever a relationship doesnt work as it should (aka disagreements, fights, ignorance), it wrecks me. I am exhausted because at times it feels like we are only working as a couple because I am doing so much for them and investing so much of my time for their interests. They are confusing me because at times, it seems they need the extra-attention for the relationship to work at all, and at times they get angry because I apparently am ‚Äûbabying‚Äú them. (I do the exact same things, only their mood has changed I guess. Its confusing me and I am feeling restless because of this.) I constantly feel pressured and I think that I myself trained them into that behavior. I made them get used to everything being tidy and clean and accepting every word they say and praising everything they do. I value the relationship but I guess to an unhealthy extent.

85,"Okay, here we go. She and I were together for a year and a half. In that time I never really let my guard down. I was \*extremely\* cautious about letting any ""serious"" feelings develop. We broke up a year ago, in May. But it's been in ""its complicated"" status for that entire year; we've been hooking up on and off, and to be honest, my feelings for her only grew after we broke up. We almost got back together in July after a particularly emotional night (drug experience...LSD...), and I realized I was finally admitting to having real feelings...but, the day afterwards she slept with my best friend and tried to deny it. For his part, he said he didn't realize that she and I had been trying to work things out...because he didn't care to ask. He then said that he would stay away from her, and I didn't really talk to either of them for a while...but she and I had to work together on a committee, so we eventually started talking again, and one thing led to another...things were going well enough, because I let my guard down for some reason...well, she slept with the same friend, again, and later told me they had never stopped sleeping together. The friend apologized again and said that she was ""exaggerating"" about how often they had slept together. He then said that if I wanted him to stop, that he would. I couldn't bring myself to say that I actually cared, so I told him that it was their business, and I didn't speak to either of them for some time. He then told me that he was pretty much done with her.

Fast forward a few months, she and I somehow ended up getting close again. It's just so damn easy for me to let my guard down and trust this person who I obviously should not trust. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me, right? I guess I got fooled four times. We struck up a friendship again, but didn't end up having sex. One day, she abruptly told me that we couldn't be friends anymore; that she had been seeing someone, and that her new guy was uncomfortable with her spending so much time around me. I told her ""this guy sounds like a fuckin' loser."" But I respected her decision. I was sad about it but I figured she should move on and so should I. She removed me from facebook, and I was surprised by how much this bothered me. This was in March. I dwelt on it longer than I normally would. A couple months later, my buddy, the very same friend again, butt-dialed me while she was in his car. It turns out that he's the new guy and that they had never really stopped seeing each other. Almost from the day she and I broke up. They say that they were going to tell me after I moved away to go to grad school...but it looks like I didn't get in this year. Knowing my friend, it's more likely that he would never have brought it up. She tells me that she wanted to tell me, but didn't do so out of respect for my ""friend.""

It's a few months later now. I'm in a better place. I'm not really pining for this girl who is objectively terrible for me and in general. I do still think of her more than I should. But, I don't know if I can forgive him. I've been friends with him for over 15 years. I have a lot of friends, but, friends like this are hard to come by. He has been a good friend for 14 of those 15 years...but, in the past year, an absolutely terrible one.

106," 

So this happened not to long ago. We were having a school trip and the plan was to go to a hotel on the seaside. But we ended up going to the town park because we couldn't find a bus. And the story beggins:

The park is surrounded by trees and in the middle of the park is an memorial area and at the back was a work-out park.

At the left of the park was a road and at the right of the park was an forest.

We had around 3 hours before lunch came. Me and my friends were bored because we had to be in a park while our friends from other schools were chilling on the beach. We decided to leave the park and go to the forest. The park on the right side was surrounded by a fence but it was broken. We go thru the hole and see tracks from a vehicle. They were very deep. Probably from a tank. So we decided to follow them. It was a good half an hour walk until we came to an bridge and when you passed it the tracks went to an open field. We decided to follow them. We then see a sign ""MILITARY ZONE DO NOT ENTER"" and we idiots didn't go back. We went farther and not even 10 minutes of walking we see a military polygon. We were excited but to the left of us we heard two guys speaking behind a bush. We sprinted as fast as we could and they didn't follow us. When we came to the sign I was a little bit ahead of my friends and on the bridge I saw a military vehicle. I told my friends and we sprinted back. The vehicle was really close to me but I didn't see it because of the curve so I dived into the stinging nettle (I didn't think about the pain I was so scared). My friends continued running and they all hided in a shorter plant then I did. The truck passes me and stops by my friends. I jumped out of the nettle and ran as fast as I could because the truck couldn't turn. I ran back but I tokt a wrong turn and got lost. I didn't stop running and then I saw another sign saying ""MILITARY BASE DO NOT ENTER"". I turned back immediately and called my friend and god thanks he answered. We were trying to find each other for 15minutes and we did. We were a little bit early for lunch.

I honestly thought that I'm going to die that day but thank god that he didn't kill us or call our parents and just let us go.

Moral of the story: Respect signs, don't separate from a school trip or anything similar to that and be cool like that guy who was driving the military vehicle.",06Jul2019,2

She is also ""shy"" so if she doesn't understand something, it's up to me to explain it even though the teacher is in front of us. She has literally shoved me out of my seat bc she wanted to sit there to cheat on a test. She has used me to hold her shit, asked for my food every fucking day for a year, and basically anything thats mine is hers (apparently) and when I ask for it back, she says ""oh my God! You act like I'm going to eat it!!"" 

This last thing is going to expose me but oh well. We have the same birthday and the month before she said multiple times ""I don't know what to get you for your birthday! I'm for sure gonna write you a letter but what do I get you?"" My idiot self writes a letter and adds some chocolate and a body scrub because I'm a good friend, so when the time comes to meet with her, she shows up empty handed and eventually says ""oh I'll get you a (picture) frame because you said you want one"" as if it wasn't my birthday in the first place.

Sometimes I regret being too nice to someone who doesn't deserve it. If she doesn't know why I'm not going to talk to her again, this is why.",06Jul2019,3

119,"Im a 19 years old girl. I grew up with violence and pressure because my both parents are polices and my mother had anger issues and my dad always told me to trust noone,so i never did. I made a friend that is a boy and a firl screamed thsti love him so i never made friends with boys because i thought everyone would mistook it as i love them, and i dont kno if i love someone or not because of it.Srill having troubles about it. I was hearing my name everywhere in the school like i thought everyone was making fun of me, thankfully i got over it. I like edgy and dark stuff so i decided to watch gore but noticed that seeing people who dont deserve to die to die for the fun of selfish. I got really bad thoughts from those kind of videos. Cant stop imagining them. I have religion problems, i love my family so much that i am only living for my family even thpught i am whst they made now, they loved me but didnt knew that it would affect me this way. They dont know my problems, i dont want them to know, i dont want them to get sad, i dont want them to die... or disappear after dying. I dont want to suicide, i always cry whenever i think of afterlife. What if ir doesnt exist? What will we feel? My family is royal to their religion and im here, doesnt even have a fucking religion, this makes me so sad. I want to believe, i want to brainwash myself, i dont trust anybody. I have had insomnia for years and my sleeping scheldude keeps changing, one day i sleep at 12, then the next day i sleep at 3am because i cant stop thinking. I always think of negative stuff, thinking about ""ifs"" like what will i do if something happens to my family, or if anything happens to me, my family would be so sad.I always see nightmares with lots of blood and dead bodies. A clear sea with full of deadbodies, the end of the world, i and my dad even died and went to the afterlife, we went to heaven(it was so tragic in the beginning) . I am afraid of going to bed even though i am sleepy, i know that i will start thinking again, the bad things, the unknown, i eill never get an answer, i am waiting for one, if you are an atheist, dont fucking tell me shit because you cant say that its 100% true. I dont want to disappear forever, i want my family to be happy. I dont want them to die...

125,"I used to pirate a lot growing up. Anything digital that I couldn't access normally. After Netflix and Steam, it became a lot less necessary.

But now, I kinda feel like it's something I shouldn't have stopped. Not because stealing is good and information should be free or whatever. But, simply because I got to choose what media I consumed. Because of piracy, I chose everything that I wanted to see. Any music I wanted to hear, any game I wanted to play. Sure Netflix/Hulu/Prime got their selections, but they're always limited. And if you're limited to watching certain things, the easier it is for you to be kind of programmed. And it's also easier to advertise to you, knowing you're limited media consumption. Besides, you're paying them, and they're selling your data.

I don't think I can choose my media like I used to ever since I stopped pirating. Like, I absolutely hate what YouTube has become. It's disgusting how anything suggested to you is designed to keep you captivated. It's impossible to find actual new things. Everything sent your way is rehashed bullcrap.

The internet really used to be a free space, where you could find things. Now it's a space where a million things are shot at you, and they're all the same thing. And while you're busy trying to find new things, you're distracted by these things that you don't care about at all.

So I think I might go back to choosing my media. Honestly, do you trust internet comments these days anymore? Do you have faith in any of the things that are being recommended to you? Does that guy you follow on Instagram really like that game he's talking about?

I don't think anything real is ever presented anymore. I'm going to choose my media. Only boundaries being the depths I can search for it.",06Jul2019,19

Vines that cling to the edges of the walkway brush against us as we stride on, the sound of waves gently breaking with each step. Sometimes you'll catch me with a side-glance and offer your transcendent smile to help me dismiss fatigue. Often, though, we firmly grip each other by the hand, with silent strength flowing perpetually between us. No need for glass now, the mirrors we need are in ourselves.

130,"Pretty much just writing this to manage my jitters while I wait for them. I'm not sure exactly when they'll get here, because I gave them a pretty open invitation to come through whenever.

I have been really lonely for a while now. I've had very close friends and/or a significant other through most points in my life, but life has moved on and we've all moved different places. I live in my hometown, and there are several people I used to know that I could lean on, not to mention my roommate whom I've known for 11 years, but I just don't have the kinds of connections with any of those people that would really fill what's missing.

I am a regular at a hookah place in my city and have been on and off for the past 7 years. It's a family owned place, and I think of them as a kind of family. I'm there as we speak. Even though I'm very to myself, I've sort of accidentally stumbled into making some friends here through a mutual interest in chess, and they're definitely pleasant company, but it's also not what I'm missing.

The city where I live is medium-sized, but where I work is in a very small town about 15 minutes out. I manage a food truck right on the main road. My old high school is up the road, and my old house is about the same distance the other way. I see people I used to know on a daily basis, a lot of whom I don't really care to catch up with. About a month ago, one of my old neighbors showed up at the truck, the mom of the family. I used to be really good friends with one of her sons who was my age when we first moved there, but it's been years since we really caught up in any meaningful way, until two days ago. Well, I still don't know if I would really call it meaningful, because surprisingly, it wasn't really him that I caught up with. It was his older sister who came by. It was the 4th, and business was dead. She only came by to invite me to a bonfire that night, which kind of blew my mind, and even though it's not the sort of thing I would have usually done, I was too curious to say no.

I had assumed that her mom had asked her to come by and extend an invite, but I was surprised to find when I got there that she was the only one who even knew I was coming, and there was only one other person outside of the family there. Even though we never really knew each other well when I was a kid, her being 17 while I was about 12, it turned out that she and I get along really well now that we're adults. I'm 25 (it's my birthday today, actually, which is the excuse behind meeting again), and she's 30.

To keep this post at a reasonable size, I have a boil down a *lot* of details to some bare basics. I am an extremely emotional/affectionate person. I fall in love so, so easily, sometimes with more than one person at once. I also get small infatuations with people on a regular basis, too, so I'm not talking about just that. I am getting the strong impression that this person (we'll call her Tess) is also like that, and there have been about 6 or 7 hints that her sudden interest in being around me might indicate that she has feelings for me. Whether or not, I have ***big*** feelings about her, on multiple levels. I am definitely head over heels right now, and that is terrifying because I'm in a more vulnerable position than usual if I get hurt in this process. Even if nothing happens on that level, I also have big feelings about whether or not this friendship dynamic between me, her, and possibly her other friend that was there will work, because I need that in a very big way, too. She has what's missing in my life. We can both make each other really, really laugh, even though we barely know each other. I can listen to her talk about fucking anything at all, and it's just like straight music. And it was not subtle that she and her friend were also very charmed by me.

The friend is definitely not the major focus here, but I also did vibe with him in a serious way. I don't even know if he's coming tonight or not. Tess is the only one I know is coming for sure, and not knowing that is a major source of why I'm so anxious right now. If it's just her, it's not out of the question that this could have the vibe of something like a date, and I won't get to know if that's even a possibility until 15 minutes before she gets here (assuming she texts when she leaves like I asked). I told them I would be here for a long time and they could come any time they wanted after 7, and it's 7:45 now. This was a lot of stress to put on myself, but the alternative was sitting here alone another night on my birthday, letting the chance go by. I'm big on taking opportunities that won't come again.

Wish me luck. On the 2% chance that this gets any visibility or interest, I'll update later.",06Jul2019,6
131,"I'm pretty proud of myself today for something that isn't a big deal to others but is to me.

My new workplace has a big fancy party every year and everyone has to go unless you have a very good excuse. I have social anxiety that flares up in formal situations (I'm from another country so not sure about appropriateness of attire and don't want to come off as under/over/inappropriately dressed) with lots of people I don't know well.

In the months leading up to the party (yep, we know well in advance to keep out calendar open), I seriously considered how I could possibly make myself sick or injured enough to plausibly not be able to make it at the last moment but also not be magically fine by Monday to add legitimacy.

However, I banned myself from thinking about the subject and just went for it despite my discomfort and ended duo.having a decent time (helped by my awesome coworkers being there and the booze flowing freely).

That's all. I'm proud of myself for not caving to my worst instincts and overcoming an massive instance I'd been dreading for six months.",06Jul2019,9
