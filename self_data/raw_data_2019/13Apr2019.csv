4,"Here‚Äôs a Friday mix of request for advice / venting 

I have a person in my life that I am intertwined with in basically every facet of my life, it‚Äôs been 4 years since I‚Äôve known them and I find myself sitting wrapped up in a lot of manipulative bullshit that started about 3 years ago..

Our relationship has been unconventional from the start. They have made me feel small, overly emotional, selfish, and have been the root of much of my self consciousness. They have made me feel smart, beautiful, and loved.

And in claiming they love me, and care for me, often above themselves... they keep me wrapped around their finger and I jump at every chance to be ‚Äúin‚Äù with them. 

They have made some of my biggest accomplishments about how I ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt thank them.‚Äù That one was eye opening... it says a lot about a relationship if the only thing you have to say when someone accomplishes something huge for themselves is about yourself. 

Recently we were talking one night and they stopped responding, then I didn‚Äôt hear from them for 2 weeks. I called and texted, for about a week of that time. The anxiety I felt during this time was so intense. This person is really good at what they do... they can influence people and it scares the shit out of me that they have the ear of many people I love and care about, and that decide how my life works out. It‚Äôs stressful as fuck to be on this persons bad side (even if I don‚Äôt know why or what I did, and ultimately I  know that I did nothing wrong.)

The time of not talking has been a nice break, it‚Äôs been nice to have a little space to reflect on it. No one in my life can evoke such an anxious reaction in me. And it‚Äôs dawned on me how unhealthy this relationship is. 

Today I got a text, acting like all was well. They said they did that break intentionally and had a plan. I said I wanted no part of the plan, at which point they told me it was ‚Äúso like me to assume‚Äù they were talking about me. What. The. Fuck. 

How do I hold some power against this person? I have tried to walk away so many times. But all the ways were intertwined make it feel impossible. I can‚Äôt not see them. I refuse to change parts of my life that I love for some shitty person. But I need to figure out how to find my own power in this scenario. I don‚Äôt want anything dramatic - I have no desire to let them know all the ways they‚Äôve hurt me. They‚Äôll turn it right back around on me. I just want to make it crystal clear their manipulative shit can‚Äôt touch me. And I also really want their manipulative shit to not be able to touch me. I want some power back. Help!",13Apr2019,1
5,"Im 19 and in college living with my parents. I hate my dad he's an asshole to me and my mom. Only reason I havent offed myself yet is because of her and my dog. I wouldnt want them to feel bad, but I feel bad. I get called a bitch for not standing up to people. Why is there is so much negativity in the world. My dad says the stupidest shit like the black hole scientists found is just that womans asshole and that God only placed the earth in space. How dumb can you be. I have a girlfriend and she barely talks to me now and has a new friend she's with right now. He seems way cooler than me and I just feel like I'm going to lose her.

The things that do bring me happiness is gaming and imagining a future where I am close to my biological family again.

9,"For some context, it was around a year ago that the choir and theatre classes in my school were invited to sing the national anthem at a pretty big baseball stadium.  They do this every year.  That was my freshman year of high school, and I was very close to a lot of the seniors in theatre and choir.  My brother, also a senior, went on the trip.  A lot of people did, and it was a great time.  On the bus ride back, I went to the back of the bus with all of the seniors and played Hot Seat with them.  In Hot Seat, one person is in the ‚Äúhot seat‚Äù and everybody else gets to ask them questions.  It‚Äôs a great way to learn about people.  Them being seniors made the game even better.  It was my turn in the hot seat, and deep down I knew the confession was inevitable.  I answered questions and, finally, I just told them.  I revealed my struggles with life and my constant questioning of my sexuality and so much more.  It‚Äôs truly amazing how well they handled it.  My brother convinced me to tell my mom, and I told my dad later that month.

I didn‚Äôt start therapy for a while.  It took the entire summer before my mom was able to work something out.  During that summer, I held a knife to my chest again.  Finally, I started and it wasn‚Äôt bad.  Not as good as I had hoped, but you can‚Äôt expect it to work right away.  The last session I had was a little before November: maybe sometime in October.  I‚Äôve been meaning to get around to scheduling another, but I‚Äôve been too busy with shows and, just recently, a part-time job.

So, the progress report.  Well, as it can probably already be seen, I‚Äôm not well yet.  This school year in particular has been incredibly up and down, with really high highs and really, REALLY low lows.  There were moments where I was happy and just some thought that I can‚Äôt even describe would pop into my head and I would be depressed for a week.  Motivation would disappear, I wouldn‚Äôt care if I died then and there.

I have notice it getting slightly better recently.  I don‚Äôt think about killing myself nearly as often.  I still get sad sometimes, but I always know that I‚Äôll feel better later.  I could hardly call myself happy or even content.  I really miss my senior friends.  During my freshman year, I only connected with a few fellow freshman, and because I came from a private school I didn‚Äôt know hardly anybody else.  I really paid for that decision this year.  I joined band and sort of joined a friend group, but I was trying so hard to be a definitive part of the group and I just never truly was.  I went back to my theatre friend group and, while I love them, they don‚Äôt really compare to my senior friends.  They are supportive, but I guess they have more trouble connecting with me.  That would honestly probably be the case with all of my fellow sophomores this year.  A lot of them may not know how to talk to me, even though I would live for them to just start talking to me.  One problem is that I overthink every conversation.  I am getting better, though.  I‚Äôm slowly but surely becoming better friends with more and more people in my grade.

I want to be psychoanalyzed.  I want to know why I am like I am.  I don‚Äôt want to self-diagnose myself because you never know.  I want to understand myself because, at the moment, I‚Äôm still very confused.

So, overall, I have improved, and I think that that is what‚Äôs important to focus on.  One day, I‚Äôll be happy.  I‚Äôll be the person who I‚Äôve always strived to be.  Until then, I‚Äôm gonna keep living.

So this turned into a ramble, but it‚Äôs nice to get it off my chest.  Thanks for reading it.  Love you.",13Apr2019,5
10,"When I became friends with this person, I was very insecure in myself. I was scared of being judged and rejected, but ironically I became friends with a person who acted very standoffish and judgmental.

We ended up becoming roommates and I was equally excited and insecure.  
We hung out initially, we‚Äôd go to parties and what not, but eventually we started going down our own path a bit more. Over that year I decided to focus on myself. I worked on addressing my insecurities and just becoming more comfortable in my own skin.  

During this process I realized: I don‚Äôt want a friendship where I can‚Äôt be myself. I owned my hobbies and my always-changing weird taste in music and my friends and my style. I learned to be proud of the things that made me feel like me.  
Now I wasn‚Äôt blaring annoying music in our room, I just didn‚Äôt feel the need to hide as soon as I sensed her judgment. 

Long story short, her ‚Äúhot and cold‚Äù attitude has just been cold for the past month or two. She‚Äôs been rude and honestly just weird. We can‚Äôt make small talk, like anytime I try it‚Äôs just awkward as fuck and she gives me the cold shoulder. So I guess I lost a friend, I clarified with her to make sure I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong or offend her and she said noü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.  
But losing a friend by being myself really shows me how much I‚Äôve grown this past year. I used to be terrified of rejection and a people-pleaser. So I‚Äôm proud of myself for not playing other people‚Äôs games and investing my energy into things that are better for me.",13Apr2019,17

A cop was sitting in a parking lot across the street around a turn and saw me and instantly pulled me over. I‚Äôm only 16 and never have gotten a ticket (granted I‚Äôve only been driving for a little while). I apologized and he said wether I go to court to fight it and say that yanno im 16, never had a ticket before etc etc or just be guilty. I plan to fight it regardless, but I know my insurance will go up drastically if I‚Äôm guilty (which is I was being stupid and learned a valuable lesson) but do you guys have any ideas maybe? I know there will be people saying ‚Äúwell don‚Äôt break the law‚Äù but quite frankly I didn‚Äôt even know it was a law that you can‚Äôt squeal your tires from a stop going into a turn, and yes I learned not to break the law and I will definitely be more carful and mature moving forward. Any ideas guys on what to say in court? In my personal opinion I think it‚Äôs a bit of a weak ticket but I did break the law so I understand why he would pull me over.

Then I remember clearly, at one point she looks down and laughs and says you're so young, I can't, even though I didn't do anything she just says that to herself all of a sudden, and that's when I woke up.

19,"Ah me and this girl has been talking for a while and things picked up in that spicy direction.

So I was having a pool party for senior skip day and of course, I invited her. So all day we‚Äôve been flirting until we got under the covers in the living room with some friends to watch anime.

Under the covers... we were touching each other and things were cooking now.

She went to go to the bathroom and I got a drink, and when she came out, we talked for a bit and started making out. The pots boiling and we both knew, it‚Äôs that time.

All my friends caught on and left, and there we were, alone. 

Well after my little brother kept on taking to me for minutes on end.

So we started making out, dinner is cooked and ready to be served. However, when she took her top off... things started to change.

I was nervous, not about the dinner, but my dad. He was home and he doesn‚Äôt knock... what happens if he bursts in?

So I tell her that we should keep it a little minimum since my dad was home... that didn‚Äôt work long.

So we start grinding, making out and such and now it‚Äôs time for her to grab the spoon and taste test.

I was nervous, and I couldn‚Äôt really feel anything, it was like my nerves shut off.

After that the spoon was put into the pot, and... I couldn‚Äôt feel anything. A little warmth, and some texture, but it was nothing there. However, she was feeling good, and in this moment, that‚Äôs all that mostly matters til I sort this out.

So... screw the cooking jokes, it‚Äôs hard to joke when I‚Äôm still nervous after it happen lmao

She bent over and was feeling good, but I still couldn‚Äôt feel anything (plus couldn‚Äôt find the hole when I was putting it back in...) I couldn‚Äôt get into it, this was my dream to have a girl bent over, ass up, face down, dicking her down, and I couldn‚Äôt enjoy it.

So I got a cramp in my leg and after she tried to suck it and it wouldn‚Äôt go back up, that kinda ended it. 

It wasn‚Äôt awkward afterwards and we both agreed that the situation was pretty nerve racking since my dad was home. 

But like

Damn it, I couldn‚Äôt enjoy my first and that sucks. It could‚Äôve felt so good, because she knew what she was doing , but my dick shutoff.

I‚Äôm so used to seeing sex behind a screen that it‚Äôs jarring to see it in person. I never directly touched a tit before, never got to suck a tit, never kissed. Maybe it was just first time jitters, honestly I totally forgot about my dad when we started doing it so it can‚Äôt be nervousness from him. It can‚Äôt be a dysfunctional erection considering that shit isn‚Äôt dysfunctional at school.

But sex is wayyy better than porn, I‚Äôve been missing out and I don‚Äôt even want to go back.

It may have been underwhelming and stressful on my side, but I still lost my virginity before I graduated, a goal of mines since last year.

I just need to pick a better time and place next time",13Apr2019,1

I had no problem naming and shaming him when this photo of him slapping nazi symbols over the city went ""viral"" on Twitter, also in this same thread I called out where he works.. (I wont name the business here for confidentiality reasons and the fact this has now been dealt with)

32,"I can be there for her and that‚Äôs all I have. Her father is abusive as fuck. She‚Äôs trying to find a job but her dad is driving her into a psychiatric breakdown and she can‚Äôt come across normal, mentally or physically at her job interview tomorrow. She has a sprained ankle right now because of a loose brick in the stairs and her dad doesn‚Äôt care. He tells her to find a job or he‚Äôs going to kick her out of the house and she‚Äôll have to stay in a homeless shelter. He tells her that she has to get the job on the first try or she‚Äôs a failure. No ‚Äúsecond interviews‚Äù his conditions are that she gets hired on the spot for the interview. That‚Äôs not how the world works. He also physically abuses her. He barges into her room and, should she get a lock for her door, he‚Äôd remove the door. Something else to add: this is her adopted father, not biological. He chose to take her in. She can‚Äôt stand up to him because his power over her is sending her to the psych or kicking her out.

She‚Äôs so unstable right now. And it‚Äôs so sad to see because she has the capability of being stable despite her bipolar+ADHD. But she has so many external stressors going on that she could end up in the hospital. Her dad cut her off his insurance and she can‚Äôt pay her bills. The psych is ~$8000 a night and they‚Äôll make her stay. She tells me that they never actually work with her. Her experience there goes as follows: she has to strip for a guard. She always asks for a female guard but they deny her such a request, and it‚Äôs always the same guard. She‚Äôs afraid of him raping her but she has to strip, and put on a robe. She eats, shits, and showers in front of this same guard who‚Äôs making sure she doesn‚Äôt hurt herself. He doesn‚Äôt take his eyes off her. I don‚Äôt know if there are human rights abuses being committed there. She‚Äôs been forced into electro-therapy. If there are, I don‚Äôt think she would sue. She might be unwilling. She‚Äôs generally unwilling to go to the doctor because of her traumatic experiences with doctors. I had to make her promise me that she would use crutches for her sprained ankle. She‚Äôs using a brace.

The worst part about all this is I don‚Äôt know if there are resources she could tap into for all this. And it‚Äôs out of my reach as to what I can get her to utilize.

I met her less than a month ago and she‚Äôs so nice. She‚Äôs such a good person. I feel selfish for thinking about breaking up with her because of her situation, because of how it affects me. I‚Äôm either there for her or I‚Äôm not I guess. Some other guy would be abusive toward her because that‚Äôs what she naturally attracts in her past relationships. That doesn‚Äôt make me obligated to her but I went on a date with her one day and we were lustful after each other. That‚Äôs how it started. And I care for her now. I don‚Äôt want to leave but I get this nagging feeling that I could do better. It‚Äôs a selfish thought and I feel like I can‚Äôt judge the validity of it or the morality of staying vs leaving because I don‚Äôt even know if I love her, and this is all on my mind.

The way I think about her is that, I don‚Äôt blame her for her instability because it comes from an outside source and she has a lot of traumatic experiences, including two rape experiences, one of them gang rape. She has a photographic memory to top it off. She had six friends, a friend group that she formed, who all killed themselves, most or all of them in front of her. She showed me their pictures and how they were like. She‚Äôs the only person alive out of her friends.

I almost feel like I‚Äôve invaded her privacy by posting this, but I haven‚Äôt said any names. I don‚Äôt know if that justifies or validates anything cause I‚Äôm really fucking high rn. If there are people in agreement to that then I‚Äôll remove the post. But I‚Äôm mostly just looking for pointers. There has to be something for her. She‚Äôs had traumatic experiences at the homeless shelter and I don‚Äôt know about any women‚Äôs shelters or if she‚Äôd be willing. That‚Äôs everything. Ideally, she‚Äôd be able to move out and be rid of her dad, but her dad is making her so vulnerable and helpless that that‚Äôs not possible.

She got fired from her job. She worked at Disney and she was late three times. Their policy is a 3 strikes, and they‚Äôre strict about it. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you call and let them know. Changed my mind about working there myself.

Tl;dr So her position is, she‚Äôs jobless and on the edge of homelessness, and she‚Äôs being abused to the point of mental breakdown, which is preventing her from getting a job, which her dad is threatening her with. I‚Äôve recently met her and it‚Äôs a fresh relationship. I want to help her in some way but I don‚Äôt know how.

36,"17 M. I never really cared about my self image or values. It is common belief that everyone is good at *something*. We all have a hidden talent. Studies, academics, sports, singing, dancing, social skills, good looking, being able to play instruments, good artists, writing books. It doesn't have to be all of those, but you would expect someone my age to be good at *something* even if they fail at most things. Or as the popular saying goes *""You can't judge a fish by it's ability to climb a tree""* .

I however, find myself to be incompetent at all of those. I am skinny, have social anxiety, average at studies, awful at sports, can't draw or do anything good for that matter. 

My mother might be rude most of the time, but she wants me to be capable of doing something, *I* want to see myself become capable.

My life so far has been very stale, school was never interesting. It was wayy to far away from where I lived so I couldn't make any friends whom I could meet outside of campus, My mother was very restrictive of me going anywhere outside our home. I never dated, never played any sports in my life, nor do I have any interest in them (anymore). Most of the people I've met have been very  forgettable and I've failed time and again to live upto my mother's expectations. 

But I never really cared about any of that until the last 3-4 months.  I've been a shut in playing online games and being proud of being in the top 5th percentile of a video game while others have been working on their lives, making some form of memories that they can later reminisce, making friends , while I've been a burden on my parents.

So around 3 days ago I decided to change, even if it is a little bit late , I don't want to be completely useless.

Since I'll have a lot of free time in the summer, I will use that time to shape myself. I am learning to code and I've decided to work out everyday, eat more. That's about it for now. My social sphere isn't big enough to get to know more people or make new friends, but I'll make the best of what I have right now.

I ended up running away at 17 and straight into the arms of a very abusive woman who wouldn‚Äôt permit me to work. I spent the next 11 years of my life in virtual isolation, I only left the house to do errands for her. No access to social media, internet etc. 

It‚Äôs only been the last 18 months I‚Äôve started growing up in the ‚Äúreal world.‚Äù 

There‚Äôs so much I want to learn, but when I‚Äôve asked questions I‚Äôve been met with sarcasm and frustration, because the answers seem to obvious to people. It doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm not great with my social skills in the first place.",13Apr2019,20
38,"I became friends with a girl from work and we got along so perfectly i was happy to have found such a great friend. I knew i could trust her and she could trust me. But time passes and i felt like she was obsessed with me. She copied everything i did, what i bought what i ate, what i wore, my makeup, she even wanted to dye her hair my color. To the point that I felt stalked and very uneasy whenever i saw her at work. I slowly started talking to her less and less and she wouldn‚Äôt stop and messaged me on all messengers as well as keeps staring at me at work. Even though i already withdrew myself. I felt so annoyed, anxious and uneasy and have stopped talking to her altogether. I feel like shit because she didn‚Äôt do anything harmful or bad to me. I was happy that i found a friend i could trust but i pulled away and can‚Äôt help it.  it drives me insane when i catch her staring at me. She does it Like a psychopath. When i look at her she doesn‚Äôt smile or look away, she keeps staring at me, then texts me on all messengers. 
I had opened up to a few friends who said she just looks up to me. I‚Äòm the person she wants to be like. I tried to ignore my feelings as i thought it might be just my anxiety and she doesn‚Äôt deserve to be treated like that, but i can‚Äôt. i seriously feel stalked. I feel like i asked the universe for a friend, i get a great friend, and i withdraw myself. I feel like i‚Äòm ungrateful. I dont know if anyone can relate. But i do want great and close friends.

I tried to take my own life a few times but i don't want my parents have to bear with me being dead. Not only that, my results had been dropping really bad recently and instead of inspirational talk to help me, my parents told me that i'm useless and the only way that i'm fucking alive is that they work their ass off. They also keep making fun of my appearance, my choice of wear and my everyday life. 

Luckily, my school held a test to identify students that have depression and/or stress and/or stress.

40,"The title says it. I just don't understand why but I can't think well and my mind will just be insulting me all the time. 

It's not that I'm doing badly I'm quite successful in almost everything I try. I have pretty good grades (first year of engineering in college) without studying much and skipping a lot of classes (which I feel a bit guilty for). I have a girlfriend whom I love and who loves me back. I have a decent group of friends in my college town and an awesome one at my hometown. I'm a musician also and I just started a band, we have our first rehearsal on Sunday. I play 3 instruments and I'm learning to sing. I'm applying to music school for next year to do it on the side of my engineering (I went when until I was 16 but dropped out due to burnout). I'm healthy, I usually run 2 or 3 times a week to keep me slightly fit. I'm trying to go vegetarian and to eat better also. 

I just don't understand why I'm not happy. Yesterday I went to a music festival and drunk a little too much. I ended up crying and punching myself in the face and my gf and friends had to restrain me. I'll sometimes do that when alone also. I hate that I have it so easy at my classes. Last physics exam (midterm) I went to a total of 3 classes and studied the night before, ended up getting a 7/10. I should be happy not hating on me and thinking that it's unfair and I should have failed it. I'll also be anxious all the time around my college friends because I'll start thinking that they hate me (Even though they obviously don't).

41,"People say you can tell if someone is lying by their reactions. I hate lying. Absolutely detest it. (Aside from the little white lies like about presents etc). If I ever get accused of anything, or asked a serious question, I smile and laugh. If I'm angry, I smile and laugh. If I'm frustrated, I smile and laugh. If I get told something really bad, I have to try my absolute hardest not to smile and laugh. Literally cannot help it. 

It's not happy smiling or laughter. Not remotely. It feels like the emotions are so strong that that's a default response whilst I try and process it. I have issues controlling emotions anyway due to many years of problems, (exhibited by depression, crying at anything remotely emotional etc. Still cry when Ash dies in Pok√©mon and I'm 29...). 

Problem is it makes you look guilty when you're not, and feel so guilty and ashamed that you would even feel the urge to laugh at something terrible even though you know it's not because it's a funny or happy laugh.

[491] Fear and Loathing

When do we get to stop being afraid?

I almost just want this to act like something of an exhaustive list. Why shouldn‚Äôt we be afraid? If you‚Äôre financially insecure, something as small as a flat tire can cripple you for months. Live in that place long enough and try not to think about getting hurt or sick. What if your life is at the apex of decisions you made long ago you didn‚Äôt realize were terrible? What if you never find the job? What if you never find the partner? What if the partner leaves? Isn‚Äôt it great that if things go well you‚Äôll get to watch your family members die before you? 

What if you‚Äôre afraid of yourself? How are you going to get the depression and anxiety under control? You know how you are when you drink, what if you hurt someone? What if you think too long about why you drink? What if your friends or boss finds out you‚Äôre a fake? What if you can‚Äôt face how much your heart isn‚Äôt in it anymore? How can you deal with what people will think and say about you if you pursued what you wanted? How do you expect them to forgive you when you can‚Äôt forgive yourself? And what are you going to do about all this debt? 

Make the misstep of being a well-read person. Heard about our crumbling nuclear infrastructure? Read up lately on the long term fall-out of Fukushima or the Deep Horizon oil spill? Can you keep up with the number of going extinct species or what comparable state‚Äôs size describes the last chunk of ice that broke into the ocean? Think the government is spying on you? They are. Think we‚Äôre cultivating unrest and perpetuating terrorism? We are. Think your food and water is poison? It is. Are you afraid of Russia or ISIS and yet ignorant of how much more likely you are to die in a car crash? But at least the car isn‚Äôt actually trying to kill you, right? Unless you ask the quality control department at GM. 

Did you know that advocating for fascism from a national pulpit to an enraged and ignorant populace can literally have us replay instances from various Holocaust-adjacent scenarios? Did you know a Trump presidency is 6th on the highest rated threats to global economic security? How funny was his comment now? You were only laughing because you‚Äôre afraid though too, right? He can‚Äôt be serious...that‚Äôd be as insane as your support for him! And you‚Äôre not insane. Things aren‚Äôt your fault. You‚Äôre just scared and getting by. You could be randomly shot at like in Paris and Turkey! You could be on the next plane headed for a national icon! 

Let alone you just meditate on how quickly time seems to be going on and how you‚Äôre significantly more afraid of being alive and being full of shit than you are death. Gotta meet the celebrities, travel everywhere, compile the Instagram photos, put your heart and soul into a lost but meaningful cause. Why think about neglect, abuse, greed, and social security when you‚Äôre so fit and capable now? When your knee starts shaking another reason to be afraid. When your arm can‚Äôt raise as high you keep it securely wrapped around your stomach in an insecure hug. 

Infuse your being with your minority or sexual status. You have crazy people constantly targeting you as randomly as terrorists seem to. You have institutions who threaten to punish you more severely than one of the ‚Äúnormals.‚Äù You have an entire sex that can single-handedly kill you any time they get angry. You‚Äôre demonized daily for just being alive and then told things about how ‚Äúgreat‚Äù the country once was when every ‚Äúism‚Äù was (still is) in state-sanctioned overdrive. You‚Äôre told a ‚Äújust‚Äù god is inspiring language and legislation that will see your grandchildren eventually oppressed. 


And what do we do in response? 

As much as I reflexively feel like I don‚Äôt want to blame people, I feel forced to. We take pride in distracting ourselves. We chalk the real work and responsibility up to a few donations or volunteer hours here and there. Our job title more important than what it‚Äôs purported to do. We adopt every possible cliche about how life operates and how little our role in fixing it means. Or that role has to be ‚Äúhumble‚Äù and give you a quiet smile that let‚Äôs you carry on like *you really care, don‚Äôt you, you do-gooder you*. We point and blame and celebrate fringe details and ignore the all-encompassing smog suffocating reasonable paths forward. We pick and peck, looking for grains of food in a quicksand pit.

We distance ourselves. We smile too hard. We drink too much. We spend all day in front of our TVs or phones or desks as we project our lives ‚Äúone day‚Äù against the office backdrop. We smugly shake our heads like ‚ÄúI could never‚Äù or we naively play with fire like all‚Äôs fair in this hopeless headless chicken race to the end. Could I possibly do or say anything as negative as the person who can‚Äôt figure out the difference between Trump and Sanders? I‚Äôm negative? How much do you have to hate your own sense of reasoning and how burdened by intrusive thoughts must you be to be suffering like that? How broken of a soul is willing to innocently inflict such impropriety upon their friends and family? How broken and negative do you have to be to entertain them in return? 

We campaign! We say ‚Äúit gets better.‚Äù We say wait till you‚Äôre older and the bullies start to respect your affinity for science. Hell, they‚Äôre gonna be the one‚Äôs paying for your skills to be rolled into the next war machine. We proselytize for different gods and Eastern mysticism. Come into the moment and self-actualize. Find your direction and better digestion when your mind is at ease knowing it‚Äôs all about you and your ability to physically kiss your own ass. Know that god is love and this ephemeral ineffable thing is perfectly reasonable the more you stoke your sense of loss and helplessness. It‚Äôs not enough to have a scrapbook with personal photographs and cherished memories. You‚Äôre in marketing now. You have to be a cheerleader for your *definitely happy life* and pay deference to the struggle by lip service to how real it can feel but assure us it‚Äôs *definitely still your bitch*. 

Fear is a mental handicap to honesty, and honesty is the only way to learn how to not be afraid. Fear hijacks and makes excuses for your perspective. It literally lowers your capacity for intelligence. Fear beats your chest in the dark trying to chase away apparitions created by blood vessels racing across your eyes. Fear cripples humility and fairness. Fear taps into the life affirming response for why you‚Äôre here and another animal is not. In doing so, fear always feels justified. It always feels righteous. It‚Äôs maniacally invigorating because it seems to belay existence itself. 

Perhaps most disconcerting is the thought I have about someone reading this. An extremely loud and condescending ‚ÄúWE ALL KNOW THIS! WHY DO YOU EVEN BOTHER!?‚Äù 

I think we‚Äôre lying. I don‚Äôt think we know in the same way someone who experiences an epiphany and changes their behavior in an instant. I think we pretend to know like we pretend to be friends and pretend to love our families. Because it‚Äôs a common narrative that brings order to the chaos. Because generations of people who were quicker to die with infinitely more accessible reasons to be afraid gave us stories and habits to pretend otherwise. As we currently exist on the precipice between human and whatever human plus Pentium chip will be called, we still refuse to do anything but play into the legacy of fearful thinking. We don‚Äôt demonize the universal roots of atrocity because they retain their utility in giving us every excuse to play our own selfish games with the mythical demons. 

Here though, I‚Äôm not going to tell you to stop being afraid. I‚Äôm not going to offer a fix. I‚Äôm just gonna say watch. It‚Äôs the thing we‚Äôre absolutely stuck doing no matter the amount of effort we put into fighting it. You can‚Äôt shut off your eyes. Watch Trump become president. Watch a bomb go off in a major U.S. city. Watch cities get swallowed. Watch your fellow ignorant monkeys adopt cartoonish faces as they bask in the glory of their demagogues. Watch every day as your reality and morality morph to excuse and accept the ethics of ignorance and fear. 

I‚Äôm negative? In trying to incorporate and work with the danger and fear, in mocking, in joking, in reminding, in building it into my proposed solutions and resources, in owning and tattooing the idea of it on my very being, I‚Äôm the negative one? We‚Äôve been sold this mythology that evil is to be overcome like by becoming a champion of implicit quasi-religious morality. Like Jedi don‚Äôt turn to the dark side. Like angels don‚Äôt fall from heaven. 

Do you think my approach to fear is one of excuses, hand-holding, or avoidance? Because all I seem to ever see is people putting distance between me and their idolized version of what they consider constitutes life and their obligation to it. My biggest sins are what? Getting nit-picky in conversations? Getting a little too drunk and obscene sometimes? Trying to play the games offered to me despite a feeling of constant personal sacrifice to your own fears of starting a fight I wasn‚Äôt offering? 

The lack of perspective is our cultural sin. It‚Äôs our collective denial that turns non-issues into declarations about dramatic life-altering consequences, and genuine problems into cat toys we kick around the floor without irony. Kick up your feet and watch.",13Apr2019,1

I get so frustrated when I cannot find pants for my size that are affordable.

When I DO find an affordable store that offers sizes in  tall, my heart skips a beat and I start to get so excited... Until I click the description and their tall size is a 30-32"" inseam. My heart sinks and I start to get angry. ""WHAT MAKES THEM THINK THAT IS TALL? THAT ISN'T TALL! YOU WANT TO SEE A TALL PERSON? WOMEN WHO ARE 5'10"" AND OVER ARE TALL, AND THEY DON'T HAVE THAT SHORT OF AN INSEAM.""

I all of a sudden realized that all my other tall sisters in the world needed pants that fit them to. Yes they are shorter than me, but that doesn't make them NOT tall.

57,"Oh boy. Imagine living every day where if your mind HAS to be blasted by music or bombarded by things like Youtube or Social Media because the alternative is just that much worse.

Bottom line, if i don't do these things then my mind is in constant chaos. Mistakes i've done in the past, things i've yet to do, bad feelings about myself and especially, the opinion others might have on anything i do or me as a person just surface and won't fucking leave me alone. Relaxation time just doesn't exist in my brain.

At work (Croupier in a casino) where i have to interact with others and i don't have access to a distraction is a nightmare. The amounts of anxiety i experience have to be off the charts. It's important that Casinos make money, and whenever a game i'm assigned at is losing money i feel fucking awful, even though i have no control over the outcome. Even though i know that people will eventually be lucky it's like my mind refuses to accept it. I end up nervous, tired and bitter most of the time. There is not a single fucking day where my shoulders aren't in pain due to all the nervousness and anxiety i go through, this has been going on for over a year and i don't get how something in my mind hasn't snapped yet.

And if you thought it was over, it's not. My self-esteem is so non-existant that i've turned into an insane level people pleaser to the point of lying a lot or putting up with things i don't really want to put up with for the favor of people i barely see, talk or even care about. It's like my mind goes into panic mode when talking to others.

There has been many times where i'm listening to a song or watching a video and on my mind all i think about when i'm not fully focused on it is how i would justify it if someone caught me watching that particular video or listening to that particular song, it's like ""because i like it"" isn't enough for my brain to be cool with it. I'm so afraid of people dissaproving me that i have to hide what i'm doing like i just stole money from someone.

I've seen many posts stating that you should read, excercise, etc. but my mind just can't focus and i just need to dull it on multitasking ASAP.

I've seen psychologists but it allways feels like it's slow or that they say things i already know about. It feels like i'm just running in circles as i spend money on them. I don't know if i've had bad luck with them or what honestly.

The only thing i'm thankful for is that i earn enough to live alone with my issues. I don't think i have friends who i would trust enough with this information nor i think they would be interested to hear a guy past his twenties ranting about his issues. Hell, sometimes i try to not talk with anyone at all just to avoid everything above.

This is the first time i've put these thoughts into text. I dunno if it will help but at this point, what could be even worse?

Maybe this issues are like a drop in a glass for someone else but in my life, they are at the center and i don't think it would be an exaggeration if the past 10-15 years of my life have been lived like this.",13Apr2019,216
58,"I‚Äôm 18 and I got a job about 2 months ago as an administrative assistant at a clinic through a friend referral. I never worked a job like this before. The only job I had was cashiering and assisting lunch ladies at my school cafeteria in making food.

I guess from the very start I was overwhelmed; I didn‚Äôt know how much work it would be. And to top it off, I‚Äôm also a full time college student trying to keep up my A‚Äôs and it‚Äôs getting very hard.

I‚Äôm in the training period right now and getting paid $15 per hour (the minimum wage in California) and work two 7-hour days a week.

I know she‚Äôs only trying to help me but that kinda hurt, especially because I‚Äôm hyper aware of all the mistakes I make and try not to do them again because it genuinely feels bad whenever I make a mistake.

I was venting to my friend who also works at the same place about this and she revealed to me that our boss told her that I can‚Äôt talk to patients well and she‚Äôs afraid that I‚Äôll make mistakes when talking to new patients and it‚Äôll cause them to not see her. I‚Äôm only starting to get comfortable with customer service but this is really taking a hit at my morale because I know I have speech and articulation problems that I‚Äôm trying to get rid of.

After our conversation, my friend and I both feel like she expects us to be perfect, especially when talking to patients because she values what the customer thinks of her and her practice too much which is understandable.

61,"I was going to type up a long thing here about specifics of my life. But I realized it doesn't matter.

A few years ago I went through one of the worst depressions of my life. I was drunk for a few months, smoking a pack a day, and suicidal. It was by far the worst I ever felt. I got delusional and crazy. 

I recovered but I got bitter. I became super into self improvement which has been great. Super into fitness now. The bitterness was there though. 

The depression/delusion from a few years ago had some bad consequences. I'm just realizing that the bitterness has had some consequences too. But I'm not even embarrassed or regretful. I really had no control over the bitterness. It was a completely natural and healthy reaction to my circumstances. 

I'm just surprised at how bitter I got. I'm surprised I'm capable of being that bitter and resentful.

63,"My wife died on December 31, 2013. She was a wonderful woman who I loved deeply. She had cancer and died 18 months after her diagnosis. At the time my children were 2.5 years old and 4 years old. I mourned her, and felt alone and sad and angry. All the things that you feel when love and life are taken from you, and when you were deeply happy and content. I started to work out very intensely, having already been a college athlete, and began to swim and train for triathlons. I became a minimalist in reaction to her loss. I stopped taking photos of the children. I started referring to my parents by their first names rather than Mum and Dad, and I became more distant from my sisters and their families as it reminded me of what I had lost. 

I began going on the occasional date on Tinder about 8 months after she passed. It was always one date, and I was never interested in seeing the person again. I never spoke of my kids or my wife. I just wanted to talk to someone normally for a night. And certainly I was not interested in sex. I did become more serious in the Fall, as I met someone on a business trip. She was 23, I was 38 at the time. I was still living in denial at the time. I told her on the first date about my wife dying but did not talk about my kids. We began a long-distance relationship, she living 3 hours away. I told her about them two months into dating, she cried in my arms and we had sex. After 4 months I introduced her to the kids, and the first thing my daughter said was ‚Äúis this our new mother‚Äù I was not that serious about it at first, I was too wounded. But in June 2015 we broke up, and I went and told her that I loved her. From then we embarked on a more serious relationship, culminating with her moving to my city in July 2016. She had basically moved in. We had plans to get engaged, and she asked for and got a ‚Äúpre-engagement ring‚Äù in November 2016. But in January 2017 she walked out after a disagreement over a job offer I had in another city. We broke up in May 2017 after a hard 5 months. I ended it, but only after I had been lied to, my kids hurt, and my heart broken. My therapist, who had worked with her and me together, said she had Borderline Personality Disorder. And deep anxiety from her relationship with her mother that was badly broken. 

Losing her was harder than losing my wife. My kids were older now and they understood we were different as a family. I felt heartbroken for them. My son had started to call her mommy, she had told them she wanted to adopt them. I went into a deep depression. I like the first time with my wife, my appetite for work stopped, I could not eat, I was devastated.

I sought comfort in other women. I went on dates with 6 women in 7 nights, i had sex with 3 or 4 of them within the first 3 dates. which was totally unlike me. I was reckless. The summer of 2017 was a horrible summer. My ex and I were still talking - she had moved on very quickly with another guy. I had been dumped, I felt abandoned. I could barely function at work. I had different women come in and out of my life and none could compare to the sense of peace I had with my ex. 

In September 2017, I met someone on Match.com. The similarities to my ex were startling: same age, same vocation, both rode horses, fathers with the same name, both the eldest in their families, both pretty and organized. She flew out for a weekend, and we had an immediate connection. But the thing is that I was desperately unhappy when we met. I had started a new job that paid well but I hated, I felt so alone. I was not well and not over my ex. I was looking for someone else to make me whole, as I was not well. And I rushed everything - telling her I loved her, asking her to move to my state, etc. I was unhinged. Over the past 1.5 years, I have looked for this beautiful person to make me whole, to solve for the pain from my ex and my wife‚Äôs passing. And she can‚Äôt. She loves me and the kids with all her heart. But it is not enough because I have not healed and I don‚Äôt know how. And I have started to push her away despite loving her. I‚Äôm confused. I‚Äôm now 42, about to start an incredible new job, and yet feel totally lost with what I‚Äôm doing and what to do about her and the direction of my life.",13Apr2019,0
64,"I broke up with my girlfriend of one year March 30th. On the 29th, I finished on her breasts, and some got on her inner leg. We were very careful to wipe off every part of semen and we both washed our hands. Yesterday, I receive a call from her. She says she is a week late, and I'd like to know, from experience, how likely pregnancy is here? She hasn't handled the breakup really well, and has been pretty emotionally torn up, but she's taken to rigorous cycling with friends as a means of coping (which she doesn't understand because usually cycling makes her period come she thinks). She was really scared and normally isn't, but after talking to me she thinks that it's just due to stress and the breakup itself. Thoughts? Thanks.",13Apr2019,1

66,"My husband's FU, but I was told to post here.

This happened a few weeks ago, a little after 1:00 am. My husband and I went out to celebrate our anniversary. We got a hotel in a bigger city nearby and had a great evening at a restaurant downtown. As it turned out, a couple of our friends were also in town and just a few blocks away. We met up for a couple drinks, which turned into more than a couple. At the end of the night, my hubby and I made our way back to the hotel and eventually fell asleep.

I was passed the fuck out sleeping and suddenly I heard a little tapping at the door. Must be next door or something. I angrily fell back asleep.

Suddenly the knocking sounded loud and desperate, and half asleep, I throw open the door.

It's my husband standing there.

He's NAKED.

Totally, completely buck-ass fucking naked. Hands over his package.

There's a security guard and some other guy (both taller than my husband, which sort of made it funnier lol).

""Ma'am, is this your husband, he claims he locked himself out?""

The other one said ""Yeah and he just fucking woke me up.""

My glasses-clad only husband squealed ""Marcy I tried heading to the bathroom and went out the wrong door!""

This is too funny. We had a little ""fun"" after drinks and he must've passed out without clothes because he is so modest he never sleeps nude.

The security guard said ""Yeah the college girls down the hall called it in. Said he was streaking.""

""I was NOT streaking!"" my buck naked husband cried out.

College girls??? A group of college girls saw my chubby husband NAKED??? And thought he went STREAKING?! Oh, this is too good.

Despite being half-drunk and half-asleep, I laughed. I laughed out loud. So loud it must have echoed down the hall.

There he is. My 31 year old husband. Not fat but that slight round chubby belly he always hides under shirts out for all to see. Desperately covering himself with his hands. Bare from head to toe.

""Marcy please let me in this hallway is freezing I've been out here for over 10 minutes!""

10 minutes??? NAKED????? I laughed harder.

""Yeah yeah, nature boy is with me. Now get in here.""

He rushed past into the room, and I couldn't help it. There it was, just out for all to see, his bare ass. That round butt I have to admit I always loved.

I leaned back and gave him the SMACK of all-time as both guys laughed.

Maybe the funniest thing I've ever seen that I will never, EVER let him live down lol.

The cherry on top is that on the way back in, he accidentally bumped a table and spilled water all over the pair of pajamas/undies that he left on the floor, which were the only ones he had.

So my hubby had to sleep buck naked in his shame until morning next to his fully clothed and giggling wife lol.

Ladies, do you blame me for laughing? Or for slapping DAT ASS? Lol

tl;dr Hubby locked himself out nekkid, got us a large bill but also a lifetime of teasing",13Apr2019,1

73,"So I work at a dental office as an assistant and receptionist. I joined a group on FB dedicated to Dental Assistants, on this group I constantly see women talking about coworkers and bosses and overall situations where they feel lost in and are confiding in the group, looking for some sort of advice or coping mechanism. The ladies always seem to make them feel better, and I like to chime in as much as I can. A few weeks ago, after much thought, I decided to confide in said group about an ongoing issue at work. My coworkers have been venting to me about our manager giving off a not so nice smell a few days in the week. They expressed concern, saying that it lingers behind in the Operatories, and if they can smell it through a mask they are wondering what the patient can smell. I was generally concerned and knew it had to be addressed. I'd like to think my relationship with my manager was a good one. We often shared recipes and funny stories. I am very fond of her, she is a wonderful woman, beautiful, and very confident. I did not know how to go about the situation without throwing coworkers under the bus, and as well how to speak to her without killing her confidence. I went on to that group, did my searches to make sure none of my coworkers were on the forum. They were not. I got a lot of responses. I was grateful, and was building up the courage to speak to my manager.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to a regular day at work, I was checking our shared work email only to come across an email chain of my manager speaking to a random. From the conversation I can tell she is thanking them for bringing something to her attention, and learning true colours ""I now know who she is, and who I am not"" INSTANT ANXIETY. I was PETRIFIED!! I later learnt (from her directly confronting me) that MULTIPLE people in that group did extensive research to find out where I work, found her on FB and some even went so far as to call into the office to tell her about the post. A few days later and I am still sitting here in SHOCK. I now realize how horrible my actions were. I should not have put any of this on social media. However, I now just need to vent at how hurt I am that these people made up a whole facade about me and decided on their own that I was purposely disrespecting this woman. That was not my intention at all. I apologized profusely to her and thanked her for handling the situation so well. I made it clear to her that I was honestly just looking for advice on how to approach her about the smell (she had no idea) and didn't want her to think I was just badmouthing her in bad name. She accepted my apology, which I am so grateful for. But a part of me is just so hurt by the members in that private group. Why am I the one who got called out, I could have been fired for this and all I wanted to do was some good. I've decided to never get involved in others matters again. I have also left that group !

The idea of hurting them with the death is the only thing that keeps me from doing it. But it's been getting worse as of late, happiness is getting harder and harder to feel and nothing I love to do anymore is enjoyable.
I don't see a future for myself so that can't keep me going. All i see is a future of never meeting peoples expectations and being alone or in a loveless, toxic marriage like my mom and biological dad or mom and step dad.

I'm sure if I reached out and said, ""Can you watch my kids?"" they'd absolutely say yes.  But that's not what I need.  What I need is for someone to say, ""Yeah, I'll ride a bike with you.""

When a friend is going through something like this, don't make them say, ""I really need to spend time with someone so I'm not alone with my thoughts.""  If they reach out nonchalantly to ask to spend time with you, know that they're really looking for some help without wanting to be a burden.

86,"So let me start off with a little bit of backstory on my financial situation.. I am a saver, so I have lots of money saved up. I don't want to try to sound like i'm boasting, this is just to give you a insight of me vs the rest of my family. So the rest of my family is not good with money, they either are in debt, have bills to pay and etc. I am 20 years old, I go to college and don't have that many bills to pay as I cut a lot of the stuff I was paying out of my life, such as vehicle insurance and etc.

So when I was in high school my mother would receive Social Security checks for me as long as I was under 18. I stayed back in first grade so when I turned 18 I was still in high school. My mom found out that if Im still in high school she could extend 1 more year for receiving those checks. But instead of it going to my mothers name, since I turned 18 it goes to my name. But as usually I just was giving her the checks since she was doing that my whole life regardless and it helped her pay the bills.

This is where the issue is becoming prevalent. When my mother filed for the extra year she put in the wrong information mistakenly. So by the time that year was over she received an extra $2000 which she now has to pay them back.  Now Since this is in **MY** name, I am the one who technically has to pay them back. Over the course of months we tried setting up a way to pay that off gradually. We got a confirmation saying it was approved and we would be allowed to do that. Then I filed my 2018 taxes assuming that I would get all of it back since they approved it. I got $1,913 for my federal tax return.

So this leads to the main question I wanted to ask. Due to them taking the money out, now my mom owes me basically $2000. And she said she will try to pay me $500 a month, the following day I ask her questions to how shes going to go about finding this money since shes already lacking money to pay bills. She calls me selfish since I am supposedly ""Demanding"" the money when In reality I just want to know where she is going to find the money. and instead of giving me good reasons to believe her she just gives me empty statements as ""I will cross that bridge when it comes to it"". I am the type of person who needs to know how situations occur especially when its my money and I worked for it.

So my question is.. Am I selfish for wanting my money back that I did not even lend her? that was basically taken away by her mistake on filing for another year?

**TDLR:** IRS took $2000 from my taxes because my mom owed them it even though it was in my name. I want the money back even though she has bills to pay and she calls me selfish.

&amp;#x200B;

So I had a friend on the internet and we have been friends for the better part of two years now. We got close fast and cared about each other a lot. But these last few months we've been fighting a lot and just generally gotten under each other's skin. I have mental health problems and so does my friend but mine are worse which was hard on him but he stuck with me for a long time. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other day I said something really stupid to him which I regret, and he deleted me as a friend (we're on the Playstation network thingy) but didn't block me. So I figured that I just made him mad so he deleted me (it has happened before and we made up every time) so I left him alone for a couple of days. Yesterday I messaged him and told him what was going on with me and that I missed him, and he replied saying that we should go our separate ways and that he'll miss me a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying so hard to respect his wishes and just leave him alone but I'm really clingy. I've had a lot of friends leave me and have issues with my parents that I'd rather not talk about that makes me too attached to people and I know that, and he knew that. And he said that he would never just up and leave me and that he had my back and stuff. I just don't know what to do. Our friendship has been dying for a couple of months now like I said and I guess I knew that it was coming sooner or later but I was hoping that things would turn around and we could have a better, healthier friendship. But now I feel like that will never get to happen, and it breaks my heart.

I am currently in a role at a F500 company that I don't like. I've been working corp America since graduating college if not during since I had a year round internship. To give things perspective, I graduated in 2014. Since then I've worked for some great companies but the roles aren't always fulfilling, which is how I ended up in this current role (I thought I would like it plus it might just be the company's process that makes it annoying). Overall, my day is filled with complaints and people asking me to solve their issues and things I don't really care about.

&amp;#x200B;

So back in January, I decided to apply to this program with the Ministry of education for Spain because it would allow me the opportunity to get away and travel as I'd never gotten the chance to really do so. I've been to a few countries but I just feel burned out. I'm basically admitted into the program, just waiting for region placement. This will happen at the end of April. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I decided to apply to a dream job of mine at a F500 company (top 10) and I've made it through several rounds of interviews, which is normal. I'm essentially worried that if I were to get an offer and pick between Spain (travel) and a dream job at a really good company.

I am one in millions with OCD. I am fifteen years old, and for anonymities sake, my name is Lily. I‚Äôve always liked flowers, so a floral-themed name seems appropriate. Being able to pick my own pseudonym is one of the better, more exciting things to happen to me in the last month, a bleak but satirical look into my current situation. That is of course, if you like weak, depressing satire that you probably would‚Äôve got out of a mental-illness themed christmas cracker. Imagine that- a mental illness themed christmas. You‚Äôd get to christmas dinner and someone would have already hung themselves with the christmas lights. . 

I mentioned I have OCD. If you‚Äôre imagining a quirky teenage girl cleaning everything that  that comes into sight with a broom like some clinically insane Harry Potter then i‚Äôm sorry but you‚Äôve got the wrong end of the stick, or broom, if you fancy (not the clinically-insane bit, I can assure you that‚Äôs 100% accurate, as i‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll discover when reading the rest of this routine. I mean, to be fair, it is my first routine and I am fifteen. Give me a break here guys). 

In all honesty, my OCD is nothing like that. To be even more honest with you, I don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve ever come into contact with a broom in my life. A mop? Sure. But a broom? Nope. Never had the chance. Maybe I should add that to my bucket list, of which I recently crossed off ‚Äòattempting and failing suicide‚Äô. Too soon? Ah well, it‚Äôs my comedy routine, I can say what I like. 

I have a type of OCD entitled ‚Äòpure O‚Äô, which is less commonly mentioned by the media simply because they like to portray a stereotype which for many, isn‚Äôt true. They hide from the facts like I hide from, well, everything. 

Basically, I have an intense fear i‚Äôm going to harm someone, may it be a friend, family member, partner, whoever it is, I get scared i‚Äôll harm or abuse them, so I have to monitor everything I do. Sit, talk, walk, lie down, anything. I‚Äôm basically the shittest human being the world has ever known. I can‚Äôt do anything without worrying about it. People say there‚Äôs nothing funny about mental disorders, then they clearly haven‚Äôt met someone like me, who apologises to a dog if it looks at me the wrong way (don‚Äôt laugh, dogs can be very threatening you know. You‚Äôve not lived until you‚Äôve been stared down by a chiwawa).

Because of the intensity of my thoughts i‚Äôm on antipsychotics. I‚Äôm also on diazepam (or valium, if ya nasty) along with antidepressants. It‚Äôs a fun combo. The thing is, the side effects of these aren‚Äôt so fun. 

Firstly, let me address the hunger. I feel like a pregnant woman at the moment with all the food i‚Äôm craving. If I really was a pregnant woman, that‚Äôd be concerning and probably a matter for social services considering i‚Äôm only fifteen. 

I digress.

My appetite never ends. Within 24 hours I ate three cheesecakes. Three. That has to be some sort of record. If the comedy career doesn‚Äôt work out, I reckon cheesecake eating is my best bet. I could even land myself on one of those ‚Äòmy strange addiction‚Äô programmes. That‚Äôd be my claim to fame. I‚Äôd have no shame. Cheesecakes are the best, after all, and they don‚Äôt come with all the emotional baggage that people do. I mean, they do come in boxes, I suppose, but is it really the same thing? You decide, I can‚Äôt be arsed. 

Next on the symptom list is the sleepiness. I think this is down to the antipsychotics but I reckon Mr Valium has been poking his head in there somewhere as well. I feel sleepy ALL THE TIME and it‚Äôs not like a good ‚Äòhigh‚Äô sleepy (although, let‚Äôs be real, apart from all these meds I take. I‚Äôm too scared to ever experience ‚Äòproper‚Äô drugs, so I guess i‚Äôll never know what getting high really does feel like), it's just an exhausted, run down feeling. Like i‚Äôve just been to the gym (again-never gonna happen). Christ, that‚Äôs an overused joke. I might as well be the brunette, teenage Amy Schumer. 

Writing comedy is damn hard work, especially when your thoughts tell you to delete every joke you come up with because it might upset someone. In all honesty, I probably will upset someone, but only because the jokes in this routine are pretty fucking terrible. I‚Äôd say i‚Äôll stick to the day job but I don‚Äôt even have one of those yet.

96,"I don't know if anyone else has gone through this, but the last few months I can't stop thinking about people in my life dying. Like I know they will someday (as we all will), but I keep imagining it and expecting it to happen. Like I don't know how I will cope when any of my siblings, parents, friends, and even aunts die. I well up whenever I think about it (I guess it comes up as a thought everyday), or when my mother mentions that someone I don't know died.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know, it's a reasonable reaction I think, after all it's shitty that we're going to end, but I guess there's nothing to do. On the upside it's made me spend more time with them before the inevitable happens (not that anyone is sick, but you know, people eventually die). I guess I'm being a bit fatalistic, but it is invitable.",13Apr2019,2
97," (Just letting you know and putting a TW here as some of the jokes in this routine are quite edgy. If you are overtly sensitive or are going through a rough patch right now then I wouldn't advise you to read this routine, or at least come back to it when you're feeling a little better)

&amp;#x200B;

I am one in millions with OCD. I am fifteen years old, and for anonymities sake, my name is Lily. I‚Äôve always liked flowers, so a floral-themed name seems appropriate. Being able to pick my own pseudonym is one of the better, more exciting things to happen to me in the last month, a bleak but satirical look into my current situation. That is of course, if you like weak, depressing satire that you probably would‚Äôve got out of a mental-illness themed christmas cracker. Imagine that- a mental illness themed christmas. You‚Äôd get to christmas dinner and someone would have already hung themselves with the christmas lights. . 

I mentioned I have OCD. If you‚Äôre imagining a quirky teenage girl cleaning everything that  that comes into sight with a broom like some clinically insane Harry Potter then i‚Äôm sorry but you‚Äôve got the wrong end of the stick, or broom, if you fancy (not the clinically-insane bit, I can assure you that‚Äôs 100% accurate, as i‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll discover when reading the rest of this routine. I mean, to be fair, it is my first routine and I am fifteen. Give me a break here guys). 

In all honesty, my OCD is nothing like that. To be even more honest with you, I don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve ever come into contact with a broom in my life. A mop? Sure. But a broom? Nope. Never had the chance. Maybe I should add that to my bucket list, of which I recently crossed off ‚Äòattempting and failing suicide‚Äô. Too soon? Ah well, it‚Äôs my comedy routine, I can say what I like. 

I have a type of OCD entitled ‚Äòpure O‚Äô, which is less commonly mentioned by the media simply because they like to portray a stereotype which for many, isn‚Äôt true. They hide from the facts like I hide from, well, everything. 

Basically, I have an intense fear i‚Äôm going to harm someone, may it be a friend, family member, partner, whoever it is, I get scared i‚Äôll harm or abuse them, so I have to monitor everything I do. Sit, talk, walk, lie down, anything. I‚Äôm basically the shittest human being the world has ever known. I can‚Äôt do anything without worrying about it. People say there‚Äôs nothing funny about mental disorders, then they clearly haven‚Äôt met someone like me, who apologises to a dog if it looks at me the wrong way (don‚Äôt laugh, dogs can be very threatening you know. You‚Äôve not lived until you‚Äôve been stared down by a chiwawa).

Because of the intensity of my thoughts i‚Äôm on antipsychotics. I‚Äôm also on diazepam (or valium, if ya nasty) along with antidepressants. It‚Äôs a fun combo. The thing is, the side effects of these aren‚Äôt so fun. 

Firstly, let me address the hunger. I feel like a pregnant woman at the moment with all the food i‚Äôm craving. If I really was a pregnant woman, that‚Äôd be concerning and probably a matter for social services considering i‚Äôm only fifteen. 

I digress.

My appetite never ends. Within 24 hours I ate three cheesecakes. Three. That has to be some sort of record. If the comedy career doesn‚Äôt work out, I reckon cheesecake eating is my best bet. I could even land myself on one of those ‚Äòmy strange addiction‚Äô programmes. That‚Äôd be my claim to fame. I‚Äôd have no shame. Cheesecakes are the best, after all, and they don‚Äôt come with all the emotional baggage that people do. I mean, they do come in boxes, I suppose, but is it really the same thing? You decide, I can‚Äôt be arsed. 

Next on the symptom list is the sleepiness. I think this is down to the antipsychotics but I reckon Mr Valium has been poking his head in there somewhere as well. I feel sleepy ALL THE TIME and it‚Äôs not like a good ‚Äòhigh‚Äô sleepy (although, let‚Äôs be real, apart from all these meds I take. I‚Äôm too scared to ever experience ‚Äòproper‚Äô drugs, so I guess i‚Äôll never know what getting high really does feel like), it's just an exhausted, run down feeling. Like i‚Äôve just been to the gym (again-never gonna happen). Christ, that‚Äôs an overused joke. I might as well be the brunette, teenage Amy Schumer. 

Writing comedy is damn hard work, especially when your thoughts tell you to delete every joke you come up with because it might upset someone. In all honesty, I probably will upset someone, but only because the jokes in this routine are pretty fucking terrible. I‚Äôd say i‚Äôll stick to the day job but I don‚Äôt even have one of those yet. 

It‚Äôs now 11pm and i‚Äôve been writing this for hours so I think i‚Äôm gonna call it a night on the ‚Äòcomedy‚Äô. I hope you enjoyed, got a laugh, or at least learnt something from it...that mental 15 year old girls with anxiety disorders aren't great at being funny.

98,"This is a rant. What is written here might look like a jumbled mess, and I wanted to say much more but kept it short in order for there not to be too huge a wall of text.

I'm a 17 year old Swede. This year I will be 18. I grew up with basically psychotic parents. My mom had schitzophrenia and was the kind one, and my dad was basically a Nazi. When I was 4-6 I had plenty of confidence, qualities that carried over until I was 9. 
When I was 4 we went to the north of Sweden, my  elder brother and both my parents. I don't remember much of what happened, but based on mine and my brothers memories one night my mom went crazy. She made everyone strip naked to perform some sort of ritual, locked me and my brother in a room, then came back forcing me to kiss my fathers penis. My brother was 12 and had to contact the neighbours, and later the police on his own as we headed back (there are only cabins and raindeer in the north).

My parents separated when I was 6 because something happened and the police came over. 

Eventually I was forced to live with my dad who always threatened me by telling me how much he wanted to hit me, not even allowing me to sleep, and eventually not even cooking me food. Apparently I was supposed to cook my own but if I cooked the wrong things he'd get angry and he never told me what to cook so I got scared and didn't do anything.

Some nights when I was with my mom she'd force me to go all the way to Stockholm all night because ""someone was planning to murder us,"" stuff that invisible policemen whispered in her ear according to her.

Needless to say I have disowned my parents, but it took until 2017 for me to move to another family.

I never take the first step to make friends. Maybe I would have if my parents raised me normally, but no one gives me positive feedback when I do it either. Everytime I've tried I've gotten a ""no"" or ""I'm busy.."" When I started high school I tried my best to secure a friend. I was awkward and couldn't hold a proper conversation, let's call her ""Victoria."" 
Victoria started by talking to me, which surprised me a lot. I was hoping we'd stay friends but apparently she was shifting schools because she didn't like this one, OK so I went out of my way to awkwardly ask for her contact info, we talked for a bit after she'd left and then she ghosted me. 

I assembled enough courage once to ask someone out, as friends, to go to the cinema. This girl had said we were friends once (though in retrospect it might have been because she thought I had a crush on her) and what do friends do? Hang out. Maybe, just maybe I could have a normal life for just a tiny bit, but no. She answered ""I don't know"" and ghosted me. 
 
I mention this because it's proof that none of my efforts ever seem to amount to anything. 

When I was younger, I was ""friends"" with this kid called Leon. We sometimes hung out, but once he told me to wait at a place because he was just gonna get something at his place, and I did for hours and eventually decided to go to his place, and apparently he'd ""forgot."" He then told me to play a videogame on his PSP probably to distract me. 

I don't really get love or friendship. It feels like the world just wants me to disappear. And so can you blame me for having a crush on an online friend whose face I've never seen? 

There is an online friend I have had for 2 years who seems enthusiastic to talk to me (when talking about the right topic). I always try to get closer to her, something she doesn't do to me. The best part of talking with her right now is that I can say ""I love you"" to her and expect an ""I love you too"" back. She means that it's more of a sibling love than anything but it makes me happy. She only ever says ""ily2"" though but I'm desperate. Please don't judge

I bought metroid prime 1-3 partially because I wanted to play it and partially because I wanted to get closer to her, and now she's mad at me for thinking Zombies were robots at first in Prime 2(it's a Nintendo game. I know I could just scan and read lore but... come on!), OK, she's not perfect but no one is and it's at least something!

That and I kind of had a crush on a substitute teacher we had in Japanese(and she was actually Japanese!) I was thinking of her just now and cried. Sure, she was 30 years old, but she was always energetic and happy and for a month I could always rely on her being there every Monday and Wednesday. Normally people aren't that trustworthy

To say that I had no one at all to hang out with would be a lie. There is a trans person who attends my Japanese class who I hang out with, and another person studying science I talk to sometimes. Even though I act confident when talking to these people, because of Victoria and the girl I asked to go to the cinema with I'm too scared to ask anyone to hang out with me or ask for contact info. I know for sure that I'm gonna get a ""no"" or get their contact info and they won't really talk a whole lot.

I whine a lot, I know, but I have my reasons.

Other people seem to have big goals and dreams, and I did too, but I realized that won't really make me friends or anything. My biggest goal is to manage a girlfriend, someone who might accept me and be happy that I exist, who I'll be able to give presents to and go on dates with and make happy. But that might be impossible.",13Apr2019,3
99,"In a nutshell, broke up because of compatibility issues and not being attracted to her anymore. I love her and care about her but I knew it wouldn‚Äôt work out. I feel terrible for hurting her so much and I am so tempted to just stay just to stop these feelings but I know that would be unfair for both of us.

100,"I'm 24F and decided to do an internship in France for 3 months, I got here two weeks ago, haven't met anyone but one girl at my work (only 4 people work at my org) who also just moved here. We have went out once and get lunch together, but, well, she doesn't have WIFI so it's hard to contact her and I don't want to ask her to hang out all the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tonight (Saturday) I pushed myself to go out by myself to a bar because I stayed home last night, and had two drinks, but then I went home, because I felt bad at the idea of getting drunk at a bar by myself. My friend kept telling me to stay out longer, so I felt guilty and kind of depressed that I wanted to go home, but I did anyway. I feel it's worse because I would probably enjoy spending my night alone if it was by choice. but it's not, I just don't have another option. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, with social anxiety, it feels almost impossible for me to have a social life, especially abroad. I'm not the kind of person that can just walk up to people. TBH, I have the same issue at home, but I feel particularly bad since I'm alone in a new country where I only 40% speak the language. Bumble for friends, tinder, meetups? What am I supposed to do? I really don't know. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what I'm asking for--advice on how to learn to enjoy my time alone, which I seem to have lost all ability to do, or how to make friends while here. Both seem impossible. I guess maybe I'm just looking for some understanding. I feel very low, and it's frustrating, because I don't want to be, and haven't always been, a low self-esteem and socially anxious person.

102,"I don't really know why I'm making this post. The only reason I haven't discarded this yet is because this account is anonymous, and if I regret making something, I can just forget the whole account. I never talked about my issues to anyone. Never posted them on reddit either, mainly because other people have had it much worse than me.
This is the third time I'm writing something like this, because I discarded all my previous attempts. Still strongly debating whether I should post this or not.
Now, I probably have social anxiety, but I haven't visited a therapist, because - well, I don't know why, maybe scared, maybe lazy, mostly beacuse I don't want to feel even more ""different"" - so I won't say that for a fact. The only people around me are my classmates, and they are pretty different than me. They are the typical ""hypebeast"" people who spend their time looking at and talking about clothes, buying supreme, etc. I don't have a huge problem with that, it's just that I don't really have a common topic/interest with them. In the past, I've been avoiding conversations with them, and limited myself to talking with just 2 or 3 friends. I'm not antisocial (or atleast I don't think I am), I just - I have no idea why I didn't really talk to them. This year, I've been trying to be more outgoing, talk to more people, be more confident and get myself together, but because I haven't formed friendships with them and don't know people outside of my class, I feel like I'm missing out on the partying, ""getting around"" stage of life that the teenager-young adult age should be about. I've heard other people say that people who experience this aren't missing out and that they still have plenty of time for that, but that's just not the same. I'm not hated or made fun of - I get along well with other people, but I don't want to push myself into being that person who everyone dislikes. 
I think that's enough venting for the day. I have no idea what kind of comments to expect.",13Apr2019,1

108," My story is... I'm a 21 years old college student from Jordan, my parents got divorced few months after I got born, and I lived in my Grandma's house with my mom for the first 16 years of my life.   


My mom showed me the worst types of mental and pysical abuse, and it still affects me to this day, she used to hit me every single day, bite me, lock me for hours and sometimes days in a room without food, she threw the worst kind of words to me for no reason, literally every single since I can remember.. for 16 years. And not only me she did the same to my Grandma (her mother) everyday too.. I know it sounds unbelievable but sadly it is...  


So finally I got sick of that life and decided to try contacting my father who was missing all this time, he didn't help me or even try to call me in any way, but I found a way to reach him, and I went to UAE to live with him and my stepmom.  


And boom here goes my stepmom to ruin my life even more for me, I spent 3 years there literally always in the bedroom when I dont have school. She treated me like an outcast, I couldn't handle it. But if my mother was that monstrous with me what can I excpect from my stepmom...  


I went back to Jordan to start college, for the first 2 and half years I was alone, I was haunted by this past, crying every morning and every night to sleep. So basically for 21 years I didn't have a life, no childhood no nothing.. I was in pain..  


Until I met a girl in an online game, she's from Greece.. she made my past 5 months the best, she made me the happiest I've ever been. She's so nice and sweet and she legit made me forget everything, I honestly felt like I was in a dream, how can someone so sweet exist in my life after all this happened to me, I honestly couldn't believe it.  


For the past 5 months we literally spent all of our time together talking and playing, she made me laugh from my heart for the first time, and she's been making me happy ever since. But now she went to UK to find a job and start her life, we barely talk, and it's not because she doesn't want to but she doesn't have time or internet, because she's living with her friend who doesn't have internet, and she's trying here best to get one.¬†  


Back in january she went to her uncle for a vaccation on a mountain, he had terrible internet, so she went out in the extreme cold while being sick just to talk to me, no one has ever done something so sweet like this to me.. and yesterday at 12 AM midnight her time while also having a fever she went to a cafe just to have internet and talk to me, it was  
2¬∞ C, yet she went there just to talk to me and say good night to me.  


This girl made me forget my past and everything happened to me, and my only dream is to go to her in UK, London and continue my studies her with her and find a job, because here in jordan it's impossible.. people with degrees don't have a job, I tried my best but still nothing.. I just wish I can be with her, she changed my life for the best and now without her I'm so sad and depressed, I don't know what to do..

109,"She and her family came to my house when I had just turned 15 for a small Christmas party get-together thing. We baked cookies.

We both met when we were 14 and we had a two year relationship - when we first met I was suicidal and she helped me through my problems, although this later caused an effect where she felt like she 'mothered' me a lot which was one of the factors leading to our breakup earlier this year, along with her depression and anxiety problems and her just feeling like she didn't want a relationship. 

A few days ago, she texted me and we talked for a while, we both still miss each other and feelings haven't changed, although we both realised that she should probably get help to deal with her depression before anything happens relationship-wise. She smokes weed a lot which helps too, and I'm glad because at least she's not self-harming.

I no longer mourn that marriage, in fact- I appreciate the time we had together, and I think it was for the best for us to split up.

However, ever since then, I feel... out of balance. I feel like someone knocked the breath out of me, and I feel like I cannot catch my breathe again. I haven‚Äôt been able to. I‚Äôve seen many therapists and taken medications, which I will say that they all did help a lot, but there was still that odd feeling going on.

119,"So about a month ago, I entered some poetry in a contest and ended up winning second place. I was unaware that I'd be invited to a gala organized by the the organization who hosted the contest. I was informed of it when I received an email saying I won second place and I didn't think much of it until the past week. It's tomorrow afternoon and I'm actually freaking out because I don't know what it's going to be like, I don't know how to dress, and they're probably going to want me to go up and read my poem. I don't do well in situations like this and I'm terrified of making a fool of myself.

I don't think I want to go but I don't want to be an asshole and not show up. On top of it, I know my family would give me shit for it if I don't. I don't know what to do. I'm probably overthinking but I'm scared. I don't know how to deal with this.",13Apr2019,1
