0,"Obviously, 3 clients isn't that much, but for ONE DAY of searching? It's a good amount. I'm making ~$40 a week, doing what I love. And I work for myself. I don't have to report to any boss (unless you consider my clients my boss). 24 hours ago I thought it was the end. Turns out, this is just the beginning.

FYI, if you were wondering why I was fired, it's because my temporary employment period came to an end, and my managers didn't want to keep me for some reason. Fuck them. I don't need their help anymore to achieve my goals.",20Jun2019,107

I am really nice to girls and treat them nice so they trust me a lot which is not common for a guy to be like this instead of a douchebag so they tell me they love me like everyday, I've always been insecure about myself and only lately I've started to feel a bit better about myself, like, it feels kinda good and I like this.

4,"Title says it all really. I do well in school in a difficult major (engineering), I even managed to make the Dean's List for the second semester in a row but I don't feel good about that. All I can do is look back and see what I did bad on, or what I'm not happy about in my own life. I'll be graduating soon and when my parents ask what I'd like as a graduation present, I don't know what to tell them. Because I honestly feel like I don't even deserve one. I've never had a girlfriend, and no matter how many people I meet and how well we get along, I always have to text them first to do anything and they always say they're busy.

6,"Today I met 4 donkeys whilst walking my dog; I honestly don't care if it sounds sad they were the best. They came straight over probably hoping I had some food unfortunately I didn't (heh, you'll see why that's funny further on down) but I figured I can go back with carrots and apples at some point. They were kinda dirty, their faces covered in flies so I brushed the flies off and began to take the dirt out of their fur. They seemed so content with me there and the feeling was mutual.

Told myself i'd go back with a beer and a chair at some point, just sit there with my dog and converse with them. Yeah I talk to donkeys so what. 

I bought a bunch of food today, like a week or twos worth. A big deal for me because I feel as if I haven't ate in years. I had breakfast, dinner, tea, more food and more food and by evening I had that final bite where I realized 'jeez i'm full' and I just burst into tears. I cried because it was the first time i'd been full in years. Malnourishment is an understatement. 

It's not nice to be hungry, i've hated being hungry. I've had to do shameful things to not be hungry. My mother said to me the other day ""I raised you better than that"" when I told her of a quick story of what I had to do to get food one week. 

The quote the things we do for love comes to mind, except it's the things we do for food.

You can‚Äôt imagine how many ours i spend in just watching a movie like an hour and 3o0 mins movie takes me 3 hours to watch that is why i tend to not watch any series because it frustrates me as i would spend days to finish one and for me movies are easier just a 2 hour movie or something i spend 4 hours watching and that‚Äôs it and i never watch it again (unless i really like the movie) but if I don‚Äôt rewind i don‚Äôt understand anything and watch the whole thing all over again

9,"So,  I smoke, like, a LOT of weed. Sometimes, when you're stoned and have  the munchies and get bored, you just.... do stuff at random. So I was  eating a beef stick (Tillamook Pepperoni, so good; Oregon specialty.)  So, I started to ponder the fact that what I was eating was in fact  sheathed in some kind of edible, flexible material; and wanted to  examine it more closely. So I started sucking, trying to rehydrate it.  Required very delicate tongue work to slowly work the casing down off of  the meat stick itself. But, in the end, I managed to remove the in-tact  casing from the pepperoni stick without biting or breaking either the  skin or stick.

But I never have and never will willingly suck a dick; so I could be wrong.

I've stayed in this relationship partially well mostly because of that,  I no longer know who I am,  I have no one I can at least talk to,  lost friends over the years have almost no family left or that can assist in a pinch.

Things just didn't work out, and without the separation I would've been miserable. I don't regret anything that I've done. I hate that I still think of her from time to time.

19,"i am 23f. 

In January, I stepped down from my full time manager position at my job to pursue a career as a Nail Technician (i want to be a manicurist - eventually owning my own suite/being my own boss). I am halfway through my schooling and i still work for the same company except i am only part time. 

Last week, my manager was let go and they have asked me to step up to his position since i have the experience. 

i‚Äôm really stuck in between keeping my focus on school, or taking the position and potentially overworking myself with a 8-5 job, with school after work and on weekends. Technically it would only be a couple months that my schedule would be that crazy because I‚Äôm almost done. 

To be honest, i don‚Äôt /need/ the money, i have savings and honestly still make a decent amount even though i am not working as much. But i do want to move out of my house (i live with my parents &amp; want to move out alone) , and it would be so much easier to move out if i took the position so i could make more money. 

i‚Äôm also considering telling them I would take the position but only if they gave me a raise.

20,"Often times I find myself on my phone doing the usual social media scroll when I‚Äôm bored. The whole check IG, FB, SC, and back to reddit thing when it feels there just isn‚Äôt enough internet content to entertain me. That habit is toxic. It‚Äôs not as bad since I finally listened to my brother and accepted Reddit into my life a little over a year ago; reason being, you‚Äôre all strangers. Idk anyone here. I don‚Äôt compare my life to yours. Idk you. But all the other platforms...they all say ‚Äúlook at how much fun I‚Äôm having‚Äù and I compare. 

I mean, look at me, I‚Äôm sitting home alone on the couch wearing a hand me down t-shirt and my bf‚Äôs boxers (who is home in another state with his family btw). I went to work today, training. HR training no less. It was a awful. It was only 2 hours but I look like it was 12. It was supposed to be my day off. I can‚Äôt even post a cute birthday selfie right now. BUT, I did go to an oceanfront resort last week and I was able to snap one pretty gorgeous sunset pic so I post it. There. Look at me everyone, I have fun too. 

A few hours and a glass or so of wine later I‚Äôm casually checking my post. How many new likes? How many new comments? Just a few. I‚Äôm really not that active on social media. If I have 80 likes on IG I‚Äôm KILLIN it. So I look back at my IG profile, how good REALLY was that sunset I snapped? How good are any of my pics, really? 

So I look back at all 17 of my posts since my last birthday. I went to the beach and pool with friends, I made a traditional Peruvian meal my grandma used to make, I drank coffee in the morning with my mom, I carved pumpkins with my bf, and I went to my work Christmas party with coworkers who got me thru my hardest days of the last year. I vacationed in Florida, Colorado, and Arizona. I quit my job and I spent the weekend before my 28th birthday enjoying sunrises and sunsets with my bf in an oceanfront villa on the Atlantic Ocean and now, I am smiling. 

We all post our best days. Our happiest moments. That time we looked really cute and were feelin sliiiiiiiiiim. We don‚Äôt post the nights we spent sweating with panic attacks, the fights we had with our significant others, the work stress and fear of losing your job or not being sure what was coming on your next paycheck but knowing it wasn‚Äôt gonna be good. We don‚Äôt post about how we feel bloated and you know what, I‚Äôm gonna eat pizza rolls and not go to the gym today.

22,"I have irregular ear canals and was going to the doctors multiple times a month for a long time. I had some pretty severe swimmers ear that made my lymph node swell up to the size of a ping pong ball. It was the most painful experience in my life, I‚Äôm not a huge crier with pain but I was crying all day long and had to rely on pain meds while it slowly got better.

My doctors told me I really need to start wearing earplugs in the shower, because, yes, my swimmers ear was from taking showers. My eyes don‚Äôt allow for the water to escape almost at all and so even one shower can land me back at the doctors now. It progressively got worse over time, it wasn‚Äôt always like this, but I‚Äôm hoping now it‚Äôs kinda done getting worse lol. 

Even though they told me that wearing earplugs might not solve the buildup in my ears, it did and it‚Äôs good to not be in pain and half deaf constantly. If you find yourself having any discomfort in your ears, even if it‚Äôs not from any buildup, I would definitely try it (I mean, it can‚Äôt hurt lol).",20Jun2019,1
23,"I got a phone call earlier this week. It was from my therapists office.
I‚Äôve been in therapy for almost a year and a half to deal with the things that have happened in my life. I‚Äôve been through some major things. 
They called and told me ALL OF MY FUTURE APPOINTMENTS ARE CANCELLED. 
Why?
Bc my therapist will no longer be working there as of the end of this month. 
Ya‚Äôll. This is my second therapist since I started with this office. My first one, I got a WEEKS  notice that she was going to be gone. A freaking weeks notice. At least they had another therapist I could see. 
They don‚Äôt have another therapist at this office yet. They have to wait to reschedule me until they have a new one on staff. Why?  He was the ONLY ONE there. 
Admittedly I‚Äôm not bad off. I have severe early childhood trauma.The worst kind of childhood trauma. I‚Äôve been diagnosed major depression and type 2 bipolar. I‚Äôm going through a divorce. Where as that‚Äôs not severely traumatic, as a southern baptist it‚Äôs the pits.  I need help. I need Guidance. And the Big Man upstairs, he‚Äôs not talking to me right now. 
But I‚Äôm not bad off. I‚Äôm working a great job that pays very good for me. I take care of myself and my daughter. Her father gives verbal support and that‚Äôs it. (He‚Äôs also about to go to jail for a while too) 
And my therapist quits?! Or moves on to a better job? 
I feel like I‚Äôm drowning.  
Not to mention I have a boyfriend (it‚Äôs cool with my soon to be ex husband) and his mother seems to hate me ( bc I‚Äôm not black).

24,"I've been suffering from a long term sickness of asthma. A cough variant type of asthma. Chronic cough is my only major symptom with occasional breathing difficulty. It has been going on and off for more than 10 years with a period of flare up and apparent fake resolution. It just never goes away, worst flare ups will cause me staying up all night coughing to the point of inducing back pain. Medication is my friend or to be precise an acquaintance. Sometimes they help, sometimes they dont. I do comply with treatment but the routine, it just gets me so exhausted after a while¬† so sometimes i forget to take them. 

No big deal, because my sense of hopelessness prevails all over these. Thus the reason why I'm writing it here. I'm nearing the end of 2nd decade of life with poor general health and well being. Im getting thin day by day despite normal appetite. I envy healthy and fit people,( Smart people too lol) I want to be like them but I cant. College life hasn't been smooth either due to my condition though my parents are completely supportive and understanding. They are my staunch supporter. I'm grateful, but I couldnt deny the feeling of guilt. Thinking maybe, I should have done better but I never gave up. I keep trying.

25,"There's this girl I know from high school (graduated 3 years ago). Since the day I saw her in 10th grade English class on the first day of school, I had never ever seen someone more beautiful than her. She was absolutely stunning, 12/10. Every guy thought she was beautiful (I promise you, I have not found a single guy in that school who didnt think she was drop dead gorgeous). I knew I could never have her, I just simply wasn't in her league. She could get any guy she wanted, why me? After graduating high school, I got over the fact that I probably wont ever see her again and wont ever date her. 3 months ago, she messages me on Instagram:

""Hi, I was thinking about you, hope everything is going great!!""

I was in total shock. I didn't even respond to her for a full day and a half. We exchanged a few messages and just kept it at that. But ever since I received that message, I have been thinking of her every single day. I just broke up with my girlfriend who was cheating in me too. I decided that I deserved better. 

This is where my life totally changed. Every single day, I would look her up and just look at photos of her, even till now. I figured out what kind of girl she was, what she wanted, how she acted, and everything else I could find out about her. I made drastic changes to my life. I completely dropped soda and juice - I stick to 80 oz of water every single day. I started meditating to have a clearer mind. I changed my sleep schedule, where I sleep and wake up at consistent hours. After I wake up, I do a workout then take a shower. After that I get straight to work, tackling my most important tasks. I started to eat healthier. I go to the gym now and have been trying to build my dream body. I knew this girl also liked expensive things, so I cut out all the bullshit in my life. I started dedicating my free time to working on making passive income. In my first month, I was selling software for $30 - $50. Then it became $100-200. Then $500. Then $1000. I've cleared most of my student debt and have been putting money in my savings account (which I originally had $0 in). At the start of this month, I have been working day and night on kick starting my new company. I already have a prototype for the app almost ready and a business and marketing plan laid out. I have everything down to a T. I started measuring my time, what I do the most and what I should be doing every hour of the day. Before I sleep, I write down plans for tomorrow and when I wake up, I write down my year goals, weekly goals, and my daily goals.

This girl messaging me has completely changed my life. I feel so much fire and motivation inside me. I have built so much confidence in myself and have accomplished so many things that I am proud of. Just the thought of taking her out to dinner gets me so fired up. I really want her and I have not let anybody stop me. I know I will get her, and I just need to keep doing what I'm doing. I absolutely cannot wait for the day where I feel like I successful and good looking enough for her, and where I can message her and take her out on a date. Nothing in my life has ever fired me up so much like this. I wrote this post because it is slowly killing me on the inside not being with her. I hope she doesn't find a boyfriend before I am ready for her.

If anybody is struggling, just know that I was just a regular guy, underweight, wears glasses, and total nerd who played video games 24/7.

I was told that I should want supercars and other expensive stuff, but that excitement is short-lived. What's the point of anything?

I have friends here, and try to stay busy with work, but I feel so unbearably lonely. My family is emotionally abusive and it only furthers the feeling of isolation. I feel guilty complaining about the distance as my best friend is in a legitimate long distance relationship and very rarely sees her boyfriend, while  I can drive to see my SO if I can find the time. 

It just really blows. I miss the comfort and reprieve he gave me from my family situation. I miss the sound of his voice and the feeling of him sleeping next to me. It‚Äôs been nearly a month since I‚Äôve seen him last, and time can‚Äôt move fast enough for us to be able to visit again.

About 6 years ago or so, he told me got in trouble with his dorm at school for personal space issues regarding girls. He said it was bull shit and later on was diagnosed with aspergers. I 100% believe that he wouldn't maliciously harass anyone like that; however, I've been around him several times where he's been acting far too familiar with others.

I've got some family visiting including my two young nephews. My friend came over to hang out and they greeted him at the door. First fuck up was he was like ""hey guys!"" and rubbed their hair. Second fuck up was when one of them came up to him like a minute later and he touched the kid on the shoulder. Our dog saw this and went ballistic because he thought the kid was being attacked. I was the only one that realized what had actually occurred and tried to speak with him when we left the room.

&amp;#x200B;

I told him exactly what I think caused our dog to act so vicious and that he can't go around touching people (especially kids!) and he just didn't get it. My friend responded ""What, man? I've known you for how long? We're like brothers."" A second friend that was here also tried to say just don't ever touch kids but I don't think the point stuck.

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen him hug acquaintances like their his immediate family. It clearly makes people uncomfortable and one time someone asked me if he was really high. It's a matter of personal space, man! People will get the wrong idea if you're too familiar!

Apologies for the word-salad but I'm having difficulties collecting my thoughts. Luckily, he wasn't attacked by our dog tonight, but if he doesn't learn his lesson, something unfortunate could happen someday.

Its really effecting my self esteem in groups of people and can have a care free conversation before my insecurities kick in, bullying myself basically.

39,"When I‚Äôm on my way from work, I use to play this little mindgame with oncoming people. I ALWAYS walk on my right side to avoid that dance, deciding which side you choose and because duh. Also, I wouldn‚Äòt do this if I didn‚Äòt think I was right. 
So one day, it happened:

I was walking when an older women far away stopped to look down at the river the bridge leads over. In the case of people standing, I of course walk around them. But she continued walking so I kept my side.
I noticed that she wasn‚Äòt staying on ‚Äöher side‚Äò but came towards me until we  both slowed down and stopped in front of each other. 

Me: Are you Australian or English?

Her: (Can‚Äòt remember what she answered)

Me: Well, because you‚Äòre walking on your LEFT side. 

She: Oh, well...I‚Äòm avoiding the danger of... *points at cyclist lane that was 2 Meters away*

Me: ...mhm. 

...

Her: Now what?

Me: *slowly passing her left* Well...der Kl√ºgere gibt nach (german saying: the smarter one gives in)

43,"I don't notice it during the day.

Wake up late. Eat. Do something...productive so I don't feel like I wasted my day. Go play video games (probably the best part of my day). Eat. Watch YouTube / Netflix. Sleep late. The cycle continues.

Some days I go out with my family. Other days, I watch a movie instead of playing so much.

But everyday, I can feel it in the anxiety I get when faced with what I'll do for my future. I can feel it when I can't answer a text as I think it'll be about academics (even if it turns out not to be.)

Then there's sleeping. I tend to have periods of vivid dreaming. In the past, such dreams have been fun. More recently, I think my stresses and worries have been seeping into my dreams. I've started wishing I could go back to how I slept in highschool. Passing out from being so tired and not remembering any dreams, just waking up in the next few hours.

I used to binge-eat till I felt disgusting, and that didn't help at all. Two years ago, an uncle told me that I was fat and ugly and the only thing I had to be proud of was the fact that I did well in school. He also said that that was the reason I didn't have friends (not true, I was pretty outgoing) or a boyfriend (it wasn't a priority back then).

Now that I've decided to move forward and lose weight (I went from 143.8 to 130.2), my family's been accusing me of starving myself and having anorexia. They've been force-feeding me, even when I tell them that I don't have the appetite for it, and they've been accusing my mom of forcing me to starve (again, not true). I hate it when they force me to eat when I'm not hungry. I haven't fully kicked my binge-eating habits yet, and it tends to come back. I hate how they just constantly feel the need to tell me how my body should look. 

I'm 5'1, and I still aim to lose 18 more pounds. I know they'll tell me I'm too skinny, and they'll say stuff like, ""Sure, she looks pretty, but at what cost?"" But I don't care anymore. I'll be healthy, and happy.",20Jun2019,1
46,"There‚Äôs so many things that I‚Äôll try to explain it as best as I can.

Here are some examples.

My view on sex and hook up culture. I truly believe it is too casual and has become a little to fetish based. On top of that I think people who partake are oblivious, careless/irresponsible, or desperate.

And no I‚Äôve never told someone to stop.

But through this, and loving relationships being very important to me, I‚Äôve lost a lot of hope.

I‚Äôm fairly certain I wouldn‚Äôt be able to be with a girl who‚Äôs done hook ups, FWB, or even open relationships while together with someone.

The kind of girl that I‚Äôm attracted to is someone who does enjoy sex, but can honestly save it for someone she really likes, truly trusts, and knows they aren‚Äôt risking anything.

I honesty don‚Äôt know why.

My guest guess is that I cringe hard towards things like ‚Äúpredatory‚Äù behaviour, or sleazy behaviour.

As a guy I always hated hearing my friends act savagely about sex.

‚ÄúYeah I fucked this chick...‚Äù

‚ÄúI got blown by my friend‚Äôs gf.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got like three girls I‚Äôm banging and none no of one another‚Äù

To me this is extremely disrespectful, gross, and the ultimate sign of having no class.

I‚Äôve stopped hanging out with the guys that talked like this.

When I think of sexual acts on someone I may potentially marry and think her flings were some douchbags like my ex friends behind the girl‚Äôs back then I really do get upset.

Then I get bothered by the fact that it‚Äôs well known that there are guys like this and girls still don‚Äôt take many precautions and end up hooking up with them.

Posts on top of posts on Reddit have girls talking about how the guy they liked won‚Äôt call them after a hook up. And I mean a hook up after like knowing them for a week where all they learned was their grammar skills through text.

Anyway I hope you guys get what I‚Äôm saying.

The dream person I want to be with wouldn‚Äôt be caught dead with this kind of characteristic of sleeping around.

Then I like to wonder how the guys that act like this would like it if their daughter ended up being wild.

And comments on my many posts about this always prove that I‚Äôm in the minority with my beliefs.

And then the whole community sits there jerking it to the court proceedings and saying how horrific everything is.

Is the Mind limited? Perhaps the only thing we can be absolutely sure of is that we have a mind at all. That is not to simply restate Descartes. Yes, you think therefore, you are. Tautologically, we exist, insofar as you can understand how to read what I have written, only because we can think. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have developed the ability to articulate some approximation of universal truths, and pass them to each other. That is the path. Somehow. This is what you speak of when you say that we have a choice between heaven and hell. Between love and fear. Often times, love is scarier. Bill Hicks puts it well, and speaks truth when he said:

&gt;‚ÄúThe world is like a ride in an amusement park, and when you choose to go on it you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are. The ride goes up and down, around and around, it has thrills and chills, and it's very brightly colored, and it's very loud, and it's fun for a while. Many people have been on the ride a long time, and they begin to wonder,  
""Hey, is this real, or is this just a ride?""  
And other people have remembered, and they come back to us and say,  
""Hey, don't worry; don't be afraid, ever, because this is just a ride.""  
And we ‚Ä¶ kill those people.  
""Shut him up! I've got a lot invested in this ride, shut him up! Look at my furrows of worry, look at my big bank account, and my family. This has to be real.""  
It's just a ride. But we always kill the good guys who try and tell us that, you ever notice that? And let the demons run amok ‚Ä¶ But it doesn't matter, because it's just a ride. And we can change it any time we want. It's only a choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings of money. Just a simple choice, right now, between fear and love.  
The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love instead see all of us as one. Here's what we can do to change the world, right now, to a better ride.  
Take all that money we spend on weapons and defenses each year and instead spend it feeding and clothing and educating the poor of the world, which it would pay for many times over, not one human being excluded, and we could explore space, together, both inner and outer, forever, in peace.""

&amp;#x200B;

Arguably, extraordinarily, the notion that speaking the truth, and reconciling that experience with the perpetual reality that Mind finds itself in, might achieve anything desirable, is an utter phenomenon of which we have barely any explanation. Yet it has worked for thousands of years, and produced the civilized society that you are lucky enough to find yourself in. I have come to understand that the unconscious patterns and traumas that we express are often largely genetic. The product of nature more than nurture.

So, if that is the case, necessarily, :something: is evolving. Something larger than humanity has possibly considered for thousands of years. Perhaps ancient civilizations and their beliefs; that we are in the center of the universe, that life is largely a product of stories, myths and struggle, and that the telos of life has some divinity, is more true than we've given ancient thought credit. Even if that is the case, I believe that all of this is so radically new to the universe. Earth itself is radically new. 

&amp;#x200B;

If astronomers and physicists are correct, 100 trillion years from now normal star formation will end. Which means that over 90% of all planets have not even begun to exist. [Where I got that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future#Future_of_the_Earth,_the_Solar_System_and_the_universe). By that metric, maybe we're the first to be in the Goldilocks zone to support life and eventually become complex enough that Mind develops, but we're not likely to be the last. That link also begs the question, how many universes have existed before this one...

But perhaps we do not need to know where we came from or where we're going or why, we have mostly understood how we've come from where we've come, and the purpose of this life is learning how to die. To do so well is to have made things better in the time you have. To make the smallest tweak, whatever you can do, to make the effort to improve anything, to weave the strands of chaos into order is to achieve something incredible.

Yes, the mind is limited, but think of what the ""One Mind"" the hive mind of generalized consciousness that this blue marble spaceship has developed. Mind is bound by physical, thermodynamic, electromagnetic, gravitational laws, but that we have any sense of imagination at all is enough to argue that the mind's perceptions of it's own limits are illusory.

The other day i was browsing youtube and came across either a dieting or lifting video. Ever since watching that video i have become obsessed with bodyweight exercising, lifting, bulking, cardio etc. Even though it has only been a few days i have still stuck too it (rare for me to stick to anything) and my passion for it grows greater and greater. I advise anyone suffering with depression, anxiety or other mental health problems to start excersing and start a new diet. Believe me it does wonders for your mental health and i feel like it could help a lot of people out.

91,"Seven years ago I fostered a lab/husky that was found on a golf course. I'm in a network of people that foster, and have taken in really scary strays in the past. This was not one of those

He's dumpy, lazy, doesn't bark, not much of a cuddler. Just sort of lays there with a squeaky toy in his mouth. 

My sister and her family like to take him camping; they used to live with me and are really close to the dog, and he's a great camping dog. Just sort of lays around everyone and occasionally goes on a hike. So eventually they adopted him.

Tuesday they took him camping with their family, and he viciously attacked my sisters mother in law. Like bad. Ripped into her arm and got to the bone. I have no fucking clue how or why that happened. 

She was sent to urgent care where she got multiple stitches and a lot of other work done to clean it all up. I'm trying not to do the ""well he's never done anything like that before.."" but he hasn't. He's ironically the last dog I've ever fostered that I thought would do this. 

I've fostered dogs I would never walk without a muzzle because they were loose cannons. Gus just wasn't that kind of dog. 

I don't know what to do. If he did something like this to my sisters mother in law, who he has known since I first got him, then I can't trust him around anyone. The hospital has informed animal control and they are seeing him today. I'll know more when they get here.. but judging on the severity of the injury, putting him down seems to be the only option. 

He's a family pet, and I didn't think this would ever happen. All of my dog training and ""well I'm in the minority of doing all this correctly,"" is fucking gone. Over a decade of entrenched in my own hubris for doing everything perfectly, and then this fucking happens. 

I don't want to foster anymore if fucking Gus can turn into a violent dog out of no where. Fuck the unpredictably of dogs. We dont deserve them yadda yadda, but god damn  I confused and hurting.",20Jun2019,1
92,"I met my husband roughly 20 years ago in our thirties. He has always been the most kind, generous, and amazing man I have ever met. It should be noted that we have 3 kids, all grown, all noticing the very unfortunate and strange changes in my husbands personality and attitude.

It started a few months ago, he started becoming very possessive of his computer, spending several hours on it at a time, which is something he never does even for work related purposes. Oftentimes, I would come home and see him locked in his office just staying on his computer. He started refusing to make dinners, refusing to do housework, saying that it was the ""woman's job."" He started getting extremely self conscious about his looks, specifically his height (he's only 5""9, but I've tried to explain that his height doesn't matter). I understand what it's like, being an anorexia survivor, but not to his extent. He started begging and begging for sex every single night. I'm not as sexual as I used to be, and I really don't enjoy it anymore so I decline every time (call me selfish, but it's my body).

I had to understand what the cause of his change in behavior was, so one night when he went out drinking, I stole his laptop from his office. When I opened it, I was instantly disgusted. Several incel websites, subreddits, and posts were bookmarked. He has an account on reddit that I'm not going to name, but he posts on the ""braincell"" incel subreddit. Terrible things, saying that he's just another ""betabux"" and a ""wagecuck"" and blatantly called me a whore who's apparently obsessed with a ""chad down the street"" (our neighbor, who needed help taking care of his new puppy while he went on a business trip). 

After I saw all of this disgusting evidence, I confronted him with it. He started screaming at me for going on his personal laptop, and we had a huge argument. My oldest son was thankfully home at the time and witnessed my husband slap me in the middle of the fight. My son tackled him, and my husband yelled more unspeakable things at me and my son. He left the house with his laptop last night and I haven't seen him since.

Please, I need some help on how to handle this. He was always such an amazing man, but these forums have completely changed him into a lazy misogynist who only cares about himself. What do I do?",20Jun2019,3

She tells me she likes me a lot and wants something serious. She refuses to tell me about her past early at this point. Flash forward about 5 months we are still dating and heavily in love. We have an intimate conversation and she tells me that she has had sex with 18 guys. +10 higher body count than I. She tells as well that she had cheated on her first and only boyfriend. And she is telling me this with deep regret because she said she always wanted something more so she gave in to the random sex hoping they would eventually date her. She comes from a rough household. One day I have a dream and its about J cheating on me when I wake up this affects me still so it plants a seed of paranoia in my head thinking that she is cheating on me, so stupidly and like a psycho I go through her phone, and read some very old vulgar messages from her past saying ‚Äúcome through for some dick‚Äù and she‚Äôd reply ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so fucking down‚Äù or the worst one was a guys saying ‚Äúaye when do you wanna fuck‚Äù and she said ‚Äúomw‚Äù and the time stamp 15 min later said ‚Äúhere‚Äù so my imagination did the rest.

I calculated it wrong.

My new gpa is actually only a 6.380, which took me out of the top quarter and now I‚Äôm kind of freaking out. The thing I‚Äôm most worried about is applying to college. I know that being out of the top quarter definitely puts me at a disadvantage.

115," I want to live my life and work on myself but I can't cope with being single. I wish I could go somewhere isolated where I could get away from it all; I'd be the only one there. Would it be a cabin in the woods? or a pueblo in the desert? Maybe a beach where the only sound is surf and gulls. I have this libido and it reminds me everyday. I have wanted it for years. Love is on all social media platforms. Sex is everywhere. Everyone talks about it. It is the big hype, the goal, A rite of passage, A seal of approval, A pleasure like no other.  How can a lonely university student swallow such a painful truth? That everyone else has someone but only one has no one. 

I try to avoid the topic in conversation. I hope it doesn't come up. I can't hear it anymore, about another guy's success. I have no faith in myself being attractive. I feel like a shell when I hear that I need to have a 'personality' to attract someone. Didn't I used to have one?  For me the word ""Girlfriend"" means ""you will never be good enough"". How can a guy who is almost too old to still be young face the fact? that he's awkward and can't charm anyone?

116,"I just attended the graduation ceremony with my class. That means that from tomorrow (I'm in the CET timezone) summer break starts. I am done with high School, and we'll all be moving on to do something else. I can't help to feel different to those who look forward to summer break right now. I genuinely loved high school, even if I didn't realise it at times. I loved my teachers, especially in my last year. I went through a time where I seemed moody and sad all the time, and they deserve props for¬†dealing with¬†people like me.   


During the ceremony, there were a lot of speeches on how to deal with life in the future, but not so much on how to get through¬†the summer. I wasn't¬†really the most social person in high school. I tried¬†in my¬†first year, but I¬†never felt particularly a part of the class. It was only in the final month¬†or so that I had the¬†self esteem to talk to¬†people as a fellow class member, and not just as that one extra dude on the group. It came after I started talking to a school counsultant on a weekly basis, and with her advice I managed to evolve into a person that could be sociable, if still awkward. I started to notice people talked to me in a different way. at some point they were even nice enough to let me study for an exam with them. This has made it so I feel in a wierd way attached to my class, especially the ones who in recent times have been talking more and more with me. I never really made any ""real"", lasting friends, yet¬†there's a part of me that wants to¬†believe those people are.¬†I hope I am sociable enough to¬†return to¬†a reunion, if that ever happens, but leaving the ceremony today, without anything more to say or do with them, with probably a long time until I see them again if at all, feels so strange and hard. Especially because I feel like these people have been the closest I have ever gotten to having proper friends, even if I know it wasn't like that the other way.   


I am afraid most of the summer will go to thinking about these people. To thinking about how I should have been more sociable from the start. how I could have made friends and been a part of the class. to how I wish I had gone to the counsultant earlier so I could have dared to speak more to them while¬†I still could. Thinking about how it all could have turned out if only I had done a few things different, then maybe I could have had friends and maybe even felt comfortable spending time with them in the summer. I don't know. Maybe it would never have happened, but I still can't help but feel incredibly sad thinking about how I am going to leave it all. I have had this¬†backpack for a long time, filled it with both good and bad things, and now I am forced to completely empty it no matter how much I like some of the things in it.

129,"Relationships have always been a hard topic for me. My parents had a dysfunctional one, so I grew into a romantic who loved and wished for what was on tv. As I got into the internet, I learned about what a relationship should be like.

I have a lot on insecurities for who I am. I‚Äôm very socially awkward and have more niche interests.
I always felt like I was on the outside of interactions, never the center. For some reason, in any friend group and in my family, I was always the one teased the most to a noticeable degree. This all lead to me falling hard in my first serious relationship.

We were both in high school, and we fell in love fast. We had amazing chemistry, similar interests, could go on adventures, and laugh together. I remember thinking for the first time in my life I wasn‚Äôt scared to be me. I would be ostracized, criticized or laughed at. Except, that wasn‚Äôt true. I was his first relationship, I guess it lead to a desire to control me. It was small things and sparse, but they added up. First it was the fact I had past sexual experience. Then the fact I was considering myself bisexual. In retrospect the list was large: he was mad I didn‚Äôt send nudes, he didn‚Äôt want me to drink alcohol or he would break up with me, he ruined prom because he was jealous. He broke up with me because he wouldn‚Äôt accept my political views and I wouldn‚Äôt change them. 

I cried the hardest in my life because of these events. I have him my heart, I opened it up to him, but I never felt good enough for him because he always had issues with me. And I felt like it was my fault. 

My insecurities worsened and I started to sleep around. Guys would tell me things to make me feel special. They would say they never met anyone like me, that they might have feelings, it was fate we met. But after a week or two, they make me out to be clingy or to emotional. It‚Äôs my fault again. It‚Äôs happened so many times.

I‚Äôm trying to date again. But my insecurities are ruining me. I used tinder and I met someone I enjoy being with, except I find myself losing my mind. I want to hang out with him but I‚Äôm scared to ask because I don‚Äôt want to be clingy. He doesn‚Äôt respond for hours and I think he is on a date with another girl (we have hung out for almost 3 weeks but haven‚Äôt talked about our relationship)

I have worked so hard to get my confidence back and I know I am just have a low point right now, but I needed to rant. It‚Äôs so lonely. I feel so lonely in the world. I just want to be accepted and loved. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever felt that before.",20Jun2019,3
130,"I just want to remind others to not give up on love and happiness after experiencing an abusive relationship. I was in a relationship in my early 20s with a man who was 12 years older than me. This was my first real relationship. I was so happy and so in love. I thought he was it for me. I couldn‚Äôt see it at the time, but he was emotionally abusive. Anytime I was upset and would tell him why, he would always tell me I was wrong - how do you tell someone their feelings are wrong? Anyway, I was with him for almost 3 years. I was completely crushed after we broke up but once I saw the light and figured out he was gaslighting me, I knew it was the best. But that didn‚Äôt stop me from feeling lonely. I went 10 years being single, 10 years waiting, hoping and praying for a man who would treat me the way I knew I deserved. I can‚Äôt say there weren‚Äôt times I doubted it would happen. But deep down I never gave up, I knew what I deserved and I wasn‚Äôt gonna waste time on guys who wouldn‚Äôt give me that. 6 months ago I met the man who was worth the wait. He‚Äôs the most amazing person. Everything I prayed for. So I just don‚Äôt want you to give up on love and happiness after going thru abuse.

Education : obtained a bachelor's of science, a master of science

Work: interned in major banks and worked full time for a very renowned private bank. I have also interned internationally

Personnally: I am much more confident, open and tolerant, patient, humane and kind to others around me

Relationships: I am much closer to my parents/sibling.

Love: I have come out as gay to people (I still need and have to tell my parents) and I still need a bf.

Health/Mental health: I take care of myself much more and I feel stronger. I do sports and thanks to yoga practice I feel much better in my body and I am more flexible.
