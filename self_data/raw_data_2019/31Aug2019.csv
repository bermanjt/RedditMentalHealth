2,"The point of this post is that our (my) brains can be weird in stressful situations. I mistook a complete stranger for a colleague and it was much later that I felt that something was weird and off. 

Yesterday we had a scary situation at work. I came back from a quick smoking break and I saw a colleague and the security guy struggling with the revolving door at the front of the building. That colleague was not my colleague but someone else, but my brains decided that a vague lookalike was indeed my colleague.  
  
This was because the daughter (almost 3 according to the colleague) was stuck with her leg under the revolving door. There are brushes under those doors, but it is not a lot of space. It was almost up until her knee. She was sitting upright, but her leg and her foot were pointing down. I had no idea in which direction we could try to rotate her leg to free her. It looked freaky. To the right of the door there was an upright sitting and crying child, and to the left of the door there was a leg with a foot pointing down (sole up and the heel made it hard to free her from the door). It looked scary, because that's not a normal position.  
  
We tried to lift the door and to rotate her leg, but it did not work at first. The dad started to panic multiple times, and I tried to get him calm. The kid was crying of coarse and she was focused on her dad, so he should try to stay calm. I felt helpless because a stupid revolving door was causing another person harm and we could not fix it easily. Lifting the thing did nothing.  
  
We called 112, and within 2 or 3 minutes a motor agent arrived. Just seconds before that man arrived we managed to rotate the leg and free the girl from that door. Fortunately she could stand on her leg. There seemed to be no harm. The colleague said he would check with her at the doctor asap, so no ambulance was called. Later I was almost impressed at how talented young kids can be to find danger in everyday, harmless objects. I could never imagine that a revolving door can be dangerous.  
  
And now the extra weirdness... The dad had an almost 3 year old daughter who was stuck under the door. But the colleague that I assumed he was has no 3 year old daughter. I realized that he looked similar, but that he was absolutely another person. I was confused and decided to just ask on Whatsapp if my colleague had an incident with the door. He answered later that he had not. So I really mistook him for another guy. Weird.
  
So: In a stressful situation I saw a guy who looked a little bit like a colleague that I know well. He missed the glasses, and he had colorful sports clothes instead of the darker tones my colleague wears often. I decided that the guy was my colleague, and from that moment he WAS my colleague. During the whole incident I thought that an unknown guy was a colleague who I should know and who I should recognize easily. I see the colleague everyday, and it would be silly to mistake him for someone else. But that's what happened, and that was adding weirdness to the already weirdness of the incident.  
  
Anyway: 
I saw the dad today, and he said that his daughter was alright.
And I whatsapped with the colleague, and explained the story and he was chill about it.  
  
That's it. I'm happy that the girl has no harm on her leg. And I find it weird that my brains told me that a complete stranger was exactly the same guy as a colleague that I know for quite a while. Also, during the incident I noticed that the dad had his foot under the revolving door, to lift it. In all that 'stress' I decided to search for something (books or so) to put under the door. I spent maybe 10 seconds on that search, and then I realized it was stupid and then I came back to the door. I panicked as well during those seconds.  
  
I learned how stupid and how unsolvable accidents can be. And hopefully I learned to analyze the situation better a next time. *what is happening*? And also, I learned that brains are weird :)",31Aug2019,0

I feel in my heart as if it’ll never work out, I’ll fuck it up somehow in the future, so that’s why I wanted to write this now. 
Thank you for the past two months, they’ve been really great and I loved spending time with you, if our relationship never goes anywhere or you don’t want anything to do with me, I just wanted to say thank you for your time. I won’t be mad, it’ll hurt but I won’t dread on what could’ve been, but I’ll be happy about what it was.

10,"I'm not gonna say names or ages here for privacy reasons. Just know that I am female.

So my brother acts very immature sometimes as he is a teenager.

     We decided to take our little cousin to the park, which was a short walk from our grandparents where we were staying at the time.
When we got there, she (cousin) ran straight to one of those merry go round things, you know, the metal circle where people sit on it and someone can spin it.
My brother said he would spin us and my cousin was begging me to come on, too, so I did. Brother started spinning us.

Brother: Jeez, (my name), you are heavy! 

My brother likes to make up nicknames for me, and today, it was
'fatimus maximus' ?

After he called me that particular name, I was a little weirded out but decided he was probably joking.

He continued to laugh and say that name. (Our little cousin had run off to play on the swings)

Me: So...um....You're basically calling me fat?

Brother: Hahaha yes.

You may think it's not such a big deal but I got really upset. I have struggled with body image and that little comment hurt alot. I used to skip lunch and breakfast sometimes because I wanted to lose weight. He makes me want to keep doing that.
Should I talk to him about what he said? He seems unfazed by it and seems to think it was a harmless joke.",31Aug2019,1

13,"My ex boyfriend cheated on me really badly. Like multiple girls, lied all the time and I was completely blindsided from it all. He was also my first boyfriend. 


Now. 2 years later. I’m with this incredible guy. We’ve been together for just going on 10 months but we’ve known each other a little bit longer than that from when we first met and became friends. He’s absolutely my best friend. We get along so great and we can easily spend a lot of time together (few days straight) and not get annoyed with each other. We very rarely fight or argue. We both love eachother so much and I honestly could not live without him now that I see how amazing life is with him. I’m so in love with him and he truly is the greatest thing to ever happen to me. 

But ever since our relationship began I sometimes act crazy and skeptical about his behavior and worry a lot that he would cheat or still flirts with girls. He absolutely would never cheat (and i mean that and I believe that) but deep in the back of my head I can’t help but go off on him about liking other girls pictures or even going on his phone and unfollowing a girl he used to like. I always feel complete self hatred after these ‘waves’ of crazy behavior. They truly come out of nowhere and it really damages our relationship each time. It doesn’t happen that often but I know it shouldnt even happen at all. 

It is almost as though I get triggered from things that my ex used to do or just knowing the feeling of loving someone and thinking they would never cheat and then discovering severe infidelity. I feel like a complete piece of shit when I put these false accusations on him and it makes me incredibly depressed and feel worthless after. I love him so much and he is my best friend and I don’t want to lose him over this. Please help. I really do try to talk myself down from these waves of skepticism and doubt but it never works. 

TL;DR Im basically having ptsd from a past partner cheating and I keep doubting my current boyfriend and I’ll get waves of typical crazy girlfriend behavior and it’s ruining our relationship. Please help.",31Aug2019,1

She was the sweetest one, the only one who would sleep next to you. Chances are with how shy she is she wont be coming back. I dont know if she knows her way back to our house. She’s the only cat who never liked going outside. I just hope all goes well, I hope I see her again, I hope she’s okay. Things have already been bad since Mimi passed away two months ago. At least she passed naturally and quickly. I know where she is, I know she’s okay. But I dont know where Kitten is. Kitten will have been the 2nd cat ive lost this year if she doesnt come back. On the bright side, at least Kiki came back inside. I dont know what id do without him. He’s laying on the floor in front me. “Im just so glad that you’re real”.

17,"When you left me, I felt empty and alone. The pain that it caused me was excruciating and cold. I did not cry because I have grown as a person, I looked into your eyes as I felt a piece of me get torn apart. 

We grew together and you have opened my eyes to so many amazing things and ways of thinking, they evolved me into a better person. The steps we took in bettering ourselves was a bonding experience that connected our hearts and minds. I know realize how different I am from others without you being the main person in my interactions. I am now more alone than ever.

My mental state has shifted to something most people do not care to practice. Being a mindful human trying to reach a place of sheer happiness. I am having trouble connecting with people, my mind state being less negative makes it super hard to sit there and listen to a down pour of hatred and judgement. I am filled with a void that I am teaching myself to be comfortable with, we all have this void. 

I am okay, growing and fixing how broken I was. I still think of you constantly, I feel like I left my soul mate. You are still my best friend yet I barely see you and that ruins me. I know that I have grown and have a better grasp of my mind but you seem to break that stability and peace. I miss your warmth when we hug, when we hangout and laugh I am the happiest I ever am. We talk about our deepest feeling. 

I miss you and love you. You are an amazing soul but when you left you took a part of me too.",31Aug2019,2
18,"I had been on the receiving end of a lot of bitching and complaining for the last two months. It was about a new job and having to move two hundred miles away to where the job is.  I got really tired of all the negativity and complaining, so I told her. 

Long story short, this caused too much conflict between us. She didn’t want to try to understand anything I had to say about hearing only bitching all the time.  And I was unable to understand that the complaining was her way of venting steam. 

Her constant negativity was still what it was, and my inability to empathize with it is what killed our relationship.  What adds insult to injury is that I gained more understanding about the situation from her husband when I could/should have learned it from her if we could have talked like I kept asking. 

Why can’t wrong things be righted again?  It’s awful.  This shouldn’t be happening. I’ll just have to accept it and move on some how.",31Aug2019,0

22,"Some time ago I said that people needed to be careful about associations they claimed they had. That whatever they claimed would be verified. Because some of you absolutely want to be seen as the world's most untouchable tough guys, this situation continues to march on. That's fine. It's not really an issue for me. But the words that come from your mouth will be verified.  

Years ago, my ex-girlfriend got into a relationship with this guy. My friends and I were all teenagers, but this guy was way older. Yet somehow all he did was hang around teenagers. So one day, he threatens me on the phone. Telling me he got the 'green light' on me by the Mexican Mafia. What this means is that, according to him, he got permission to from the Mexican Mafia to kill me. Very irresponsible thing to say. Like I said, he was a much older guy like in his late 20's. I was about 17 years of age at the time. So my ex-girlfriend decided that she din't like him very much and admitted that he was a police informant for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. I always knew this, but I never said anything. I mean who hangs around teenagers and threatens them? Something a cop would do. 

As luck would have it, this man now runs an establishment in downtown Pomona (California) and has probably forgotten all about his story of an authorization to have me killed. Unfortunately for him, I have not forgotten. Neither has my family.

Fast forward to a couple of years ago. A man presented himself as being associated with a well known Los Angeles area gang. On this presentation, this man put some things into action that this street gang had no knowledge of. So what happened? A meeting was organized and this man's identity was brought up and nobody spoke up for him. Nobody knew who he was. He didn't think that anyone would ever have the ability to verify anything about him or what he said.  

Let's journey on over to Chicago. This is where an older man (now presumably deceased) supposedly ran a trucking company. For some reason or another he left this area and headed to San Bernardino County where he would hang out in a bowling alley and tell everyone he was affiliated with what he purported to be the Chicago Mafia. You know how the story goes, don't you?  

Some people contacted some other people, who contacted some more people and nobody knows who this guy was. Nobody spoke up for this guy and his story of being affiliated with what he described as the mafia in Chicago. It makes sense if you think about. If he was involved with this sort of thing, why come out to Southern California? Why would a man who presented himself as a mobster hang out in a bowling alley filled with mostly teenagers? Why would he openly admit having involvement, when the mere act of having involvement is a Federal crime?

Now earlier today I came across something where some of you have introduced a brand new group of people into this virtual reality you've created for yourselves. If these people find out that some of you are making death threats, or other threats of violence or whatever, they are going to come after you. I'm glad I couldn't find the thread a little while ago because it made me extremely angry when I read through it. And I know if it makes me angry, other people are going to became infuriated past the point of reasonable behavior.

This doesn't work like you think it does. People verify what they're told and go to great lengths to determine what actually took place. If these people find out someone is lying, it'll be nothing but serious trouble. For example, the deputy that my former friend was speaking to was tracked down and his identity verified. That incident actually took place. I don't know why he bothered with that drama, but he went for it and was caught.",31Aug2019,0
23,"Ok so let’s start with my skin cancer diagnosis and multiple, very painful surgeries involved with that. I have had five procedures at this point resulting in dozens of stitches and large scars. My dad then passed away on my birthday, and absolutely broke my heart. I have been battling severe depression and grief with that, and also my mom has Alzheimer’s. I took over her household responsibilities as well as coordinating her care. She stays with me half the time, and it is beyond stressful when she is here. She gets the notion to leave and becomes aggressive and violent, and I had to call 911 to help me get her out of the middle of the road a couple days ago. This resulted in police and EMT’s surrounding her and her threatening suicide, which turned into an involuntary stay in the hospital for a physiological evaluation.  It is getting harder and harder to deal with her but my family does not believe in nursing homes, so that is all on me. My mom had an elderly dog, who died yesterday while she was here. This has resulted in her asking after him and then bursting into tears repeatedly. It also made my kids super upset that the dog died, and I know it’s not good for them to see their nana act this way but I have no other options. So now I have my husband, two small kids, two dogs and two guinea pigs and my own home to take care of, my Alzheimer’s mom, and my own health and sanity. I don’t have friends, or anyone to talk to.

We met on the worst of all places, Tinder. I was drunk with friends and downloaded it for the first time and we actually hit it off. The first date was the first one I had since I broke up with my long term boyfriend. It wasn’t a good relationship and messed me up really bad, but I wanted to try and move on. We had a decent time, I ignored some small red flags, but you weren’t creepy. We went on a second date and that’s when our relationship started.

I don’t know why I decided to pursue you when nicer guys were in the picture. I think I felt I didn’t deserve to be treated nicely, because that’s how my ex treated me when he wanted to manipulate me. I went for you, a guy he put in no effort and expected me to make all the plans. It was frustrating but my loneliness and rebounding wanted you to reciprocate.

Honestly we had fun times together and I was happy to get to know you. Right before the summer ended I realized that I started to form feelings for you, a first since my ex. I knew I was leaving soon so it hurt when you told me you didn’t want to pursue a relationship after the summer. I refused to cry in front of you.

Since then I swore to myself no guys, I want to focus on friends and building my confidence after losing it all. I’ve done well so far, but the part of me that has no dignity wanted you to text me at 2 am to ask me to come over. I probably would say no, but I wanted you to show that you actually wanted me. You could never admit you liked me, only subtly hint and drive me crazy. 

We still snapchat, even though I know I should stop. I remember you snap chatting girls when we were together, I guess now I’m one of those girls on your list of names. I know I probably meant nothing to you, but for me you helped me realize I was moving on.

I opened tinder to see if I had messages despite turning it off weeks ago. I had a few unread ones, but then I noticed in my feed you just updated your tinder. It shouldn’t hurt but it does. It’s not a heartbreak hurt, but an insecure one. For some reason I thought I meant more to you and you wouldn’t run back to tinder. It was a stupid thought.

I’m just a young girl trying to figure out what I deserve. I deserve someone who accepts me for who I am, someone who puts in effort to show me I’m loved, someone who can respect me. You were a mistake I learned from, but not one I regret. Hopefully you won’t forget our little summer together.",31Aug2019,0

37," 

I grew up in a house where infidelity was normal. My Dad cheated on my Mom for years, and she knew about it. My eldest sister probably cheated on every partner she’s had, and we’d even have those she cheated with over for dinner. My other sister did the same, jumping from one guy to another, while still talking to the guy she jumped from and a bunch more all at the same time. On the other hand, my other sister had her high school sweetheart cheat on her yet she still pined over him and put him on a pedestal. To me, cheaters aren’t evil, they’re just people who choose to do what they wanted. While I knew it was wrong, I grew up understanding that it was a part of life to cheat or be cheated on.

It didn’t help that we all live in a society and culture where infidelity was normal and romanticized. Films like The Other Woman, The Mistress, and there’s even one called Etiquette for Mistresses, where characters taught the audience how to behave in front of the wife, how to dress properly, and even how to ask for the right things to keep the secret. Though, nowadays, there are people on Twitter and other social media platforms who voice out their opinions on the topic and how if you do it, you’re immediately trashy person or a monster. While I am able to read their tweets and opinions, I also revert to thinking that they didn’t grow up in the same family I did, or they didn’t have the same understanding as me and that’s okay, because people have different opinions. Their views on the matter made sense to me, but the years I grew up in my family and the movies I’ve watched outweighed it.

They say that growing up with parents or family members who were unfaithful to their partners could result to two outcomes for the child, and unfortunately, the outcome I had wasn’t great. With that and being surrounded by what they call the mistress culture, I learned to realize that it didn’t matter which end of the situation you were in, life went on. The things I’ve witnessed and watched over the years led me to do the same in high school. I had 3 “boyfriends”, I cheated on all of them, and I didn’t care that I did because they did the same too. Having mistresses, one night stands, and multiple partners at the same time were never new to me. I genuinely thought that it’s just what people did and that doesn’t make them bad people. 

I believed in all of that until I met my college boyfriend. He was kind, sweet, and very charming. He knew about my “boyfriends” and what I did to them, but he didn’t care as long as I wanted to change for the better, he said. But, he also didn’t grow up in the same house as I did or watched the same movies, so his hatred toward infidelity was very strong. Overtime, I also realized that wait, it isn’t normal to cheat or be cheated on. From then, I learned the depth of what my Dad did to my Mom. What he did led her to leave home, leaving me and my siblings behind, just to start a new life away from a cheater. I learned that the reason why my sister has had so many partners, it’s because they couldn’t stand what she has done to them and why my other sisters did that, it’s because she was getting played by those guys she jumped to and from as well. I learned so much from my college boyfriend and I was so scared to end up like my family. I was scared to the point that every time a guy would merely look at me, I had to tell my boyfriend. If someone added me on Facebook, I would decline right away.

But that fear faded, and for a very short while, I went back to who I was in high school. I did what I thought was unthinkable for me to do to my boyfriend. I did it, I cheated on the one guy that changed my outlook on life and taught me that life doesn’t have to be dark and ugly, that it could be filled with love and passion. My Mom forgave my Dad and are now in good terms, and my sister only had good things to talk about her boyfriend who cheated, so I thought that even if you do it, you will be forgiven and life went on. Only now am I truly realizing the consequences of cheating on the one you love because he didn’t forgive me and yes, life went on, but with so much pain and anger. So much tears during the night, so much regret, and so much self-blame.

I grew up in a house where infidelity was normal. I’m already 21 and only now am I beginning to learn and realize that it really isn’t. It’s horrible, painful, and a monstrous thing to do to those you love.",31Aug2019,10
39,"Okay so TODAY I just thought to share this with you. Life works in so many magical ways I actually can not describe into manifestation. I decided to share this with you because this happened to me today: the mother of an old best friend introduced me to her daughter (my old best friend) at her Greek restaurant while I decided to go out for a walk on the street to the subway station and now let’s just say I think I have an opportunity?

A little backstory: I moved out at 17 because of abuse from my mother. I only moved in with her at 14 since I used to live with my grandparents and aunts in one house until they sold it and all moved out. I thought 17 moving out was really good for me to improve on myself and “find myself” and was so excited to just still be me. New highschool and I met a family friend there that introduced me to my “old best friend”and we just been really tight ever since like I was going through a rough situation already being on my own and going to school and she would really brighten me up (we were literally in the same neighbourhood) I would ALWAYS be at her apt and have a laugh with her and make some memories. I considered her close with me. I would be there for her sometimes meanwhile she was there for me too. We were also honest with each other, and shared each others stories of our lives. My mother met her mother too. Until after a little dispute between my old family friend and the Greek girl and me went on we all split up and after shortly awhile she came forward to me and apologized. We became good friends again and stuff until she got into a relationship and we started to drift apart... which I knew was gonna happen. While this was going on I removed myself from renting only 1 bedroom out of a cracked up basement with a crackhead next door - I moved to a bachelor. Which was such a lucky find after such a hassle scam I was literally going through with finding another place to gtfo!!! Around this time literally I broke up out a relationship with my “ex” LONG DISTANCE in nyc. I reside in Toronto. Which was pretty hard but it was a good feeling. Also I was in school to figure out my shit, and I had a lot of money like I went to LONDON anddd MY COUNTRY for a visit after years and years being on a plane to see my AUNT AND FAMILY!! So happy. But I got back And worked at an office which I hated and was depressing. And I was so so so so so fat. After that... summer came again and I fucked up my stomach, diagnosed with IBS, became more fatter. I got depressed. My other “best friend” which was from my own country was fake to me the whole time because she also got into a relationship and LITERALLY stopped talking to me. Which I get. But I’m just lonely, and around this time I stopped talking to my crush because my crush just stopped talking to me for idek what reason but at this point I was at my lowest point, family was just so weird. One of my aunts cut me off because she thought I was talking to me mom. Lol. So I was like okay. Clearly everyone is done with me? I guess I was crying every night. No plans. Stuck at this office job. Fat. Depressed. Lonely. Binging. Brooding. Started calling suicide hotlines for like comfort? I started weed. Felt kinda happy? I felt very free though. And I grew my hair and permed it and I felt new but I got sick of it and cut it. I worked at red lobster but there was never a chance to be a server ( I was struggling heavily financially like very bad every week) because u needed to wait until one of the servers actually died for u to be replaced. Then summer came again. While I have not talked to her, now all of a sudden I lost two jobs. “Broke up” twice with two other guys all in who I’m really trying to be, who I am as a person this journey in self discovery. That’s adulting right LOL. I met so many people that changed me and inspired I just can’t name but yeah and things are in the air my thoughts of what to do financially because practically... that is my concern of course. I need to support myself! I want to go to school in January I’m planning I wanna go to college either do something with coding programming (lots of opportunities) or law like at least para legal! I want to be successful and help others in all ways possible. I want to support my family. I really do. I want them to love me lmfao I just want them to be happy. And a lot of ppl came back into my life from before I lived with my mom. My best friends. People I consider really close now that we are adults together !  We see how life is now clearly and How we live it. Being real. And so I’m walking and I see her on the phone I looked only once cause it was just a woman in the dark on the phone (odd idk) and I looked once from afar I actually noticed it was her so it was awkward. But I’m like whatever I’m going to be nice so I looked twice and I actually smiled back and waved and said hello! As I was walking tho. And she actually was while on the phone enthusiastically called my name and asked me how I am and repeated my name many times. Mentioned the Greek girl I was not friends with pouting to the place and literally grabbed my hand and took me to the restaurant and we entered and she was serving. We hugged said hello. So awkward we are like smiling too. Then we are talking. Turns out the mom OWNS a whole ass restaurant on a busy street. Pretty inspiring and impressive for modern immigrants right? It crazy cause my grandma mentioned me to work there. The owner of this other restaurant mentioned to his daughter which was GOOD friends with me like family to tell me to work there too! I ignored it especially when I figured she works there long before time today we just met. It’s just weird. It’s definitely an easy opportunity. To work there and just be back to normal yknow? I can work there as a server, after I left working at this other restaurant I was working for but I just felt so so not confident and very anxious there (family run) so it’s good I guess I left there yknow. This other job I have now is ending too it’s at the beach so it’s seasonal. It’s crazy cause it’s like I got REINTRODUCED to her. I cut my perm off some time ago. Right now I lost so much fat. I’m literally fit (NOT SKINNY AND NOT FAT, average) and I’m happy. I have more control in my thoughts. I’m more optimistic. I have a busy life running errands and meeting people like even friends. Everyone wants to talk to me. And they’re actually happy and they love talking to me and I clearly can see that that they care too. But I also feel deattached. Very de attached so yes I have trouble getting close with people. From where I come from obviously. How life works right? Sorry for the bible. Lmfao this message is to show y’all that life has its ways yknow u may Be in the dark but trust me you’re seeing the light in the tunnel because as you keep going in LIFE it gets BRIGHTER because you are always living and going through it Regardless. I love y’all.

I have traveling/hiking trips planned for the next two weeks, and I’m scared to do any of it now. All I can think about is him and my other friend that was with him when the accident happened. I feel guilty that this happened to him although it was a freak accident and had nothing to do with me. I feel so lost.",31Aug2019,8
41,"Okay TODAY I just thought to share this with you. Life works in so many magical ways I actually can not describe into manifestation. I decided to share this with you because this happened to me today: the mother of an old best friend introduced me to her daughter (my old best friend) at her Greek restaurant while I decided to go out for a walk on the street to the subway station and now let’s just say I think I have an opportunity?

A little backstory: I moved out at 17 because of abuse from my mother. I only moved in with her at 14 since I used to live with my grandparents and aunts in one house until they sold it and all moved out.

43,"I’m from a small town of about 1000 people with a class size of 80, and in two days, I’m moving to a city with a class size of 5000+. 

I’ve never been away from my house for more than a week, and I’ve always valued privacy and quiet, but now I’ll be living in a dorm building with 1000 other people. 

I haven’t made a close friend in years, and I sort of forgot how to make friends in general. It’s hard for me to be myself around people unless they’re my best friends. I’ve made decent new friends over the years but could never manage to get really close with someone. I know deep down that I’ll probably make good friends, but when I say it, it’s just hard to believe. 

i’m moving two hours away from home, and it doesn’t feel real. I feel like I should have more time and I don’t feel ready. 

I’ve never been in a relationship; I blame it on the fact that my school had a small selection of girls, but it’s really because I never knew how and I never had the balls. Now I feel like that’ll show. I really want to get to know a girl but I feel like I’ll mess it up. 

The past couple times I introduced myself into a new setting/group of people, I fucked it up. At my last two jobs, I’d be a people pleaser; I’d say what I think other people would want to hear from me, not what I genuinely felt. As I acted the same way at these jobs for a longer time, people got a completely different idea of who I actually was. I don’t want to make that same mistake at college. 

I just feel so alone. I understand that thousands of people feel this way, but it just feels different and more scary. I know a handful of people going to my college, but I still feel alone as none of them are really my friends. I’m even already decent friends with my roommate but I still feel alone, because I feel like I don’t REALLY know him. I compare myself to my friends who are very similar to me and have already moved in to their own college: two of my friends are rooming together which seems a lot easier. Two of my friends are going to the same college which would be easier. One of my friends is going to a college 15 minutes from our hometown. Another friend is going to a smaller, less prestigious college which also seems less intimidating. My friends even told me they are glad they are not going to my college, as it seems a lot bigger and scarier. It’s also a big party school, and I’ve never been one to really enjoy that type of crowd. 

It may seem like I 100% do not want to go to this school, but there are plenty of redeeming qualities (I’m about 75% nervous and scared but 25% excited). I’ve wanted to go to this school since I was very young. The campus is amazing and there are plenty of things to do. I’ve always wanted to experience city life. I’ve never heard bad things about this school. And the education quality for my major is supposed to be very high. I also sometimes get tired of my friends and of being single, but the idea of meeting new people still scares me. Someone I know that already moved in to my school was talking to me today, and she sent a picture of her with a bunch of friends. I really just felt left out and uncomfortable, because I felt like I wouldn’t be able to make friends myself. 

If you haven’t been able to tell, I don’t have super high self confidence. I’ve never been in a relationship, I’ve stuck with the same few friends my whole life, I worry about little things, and I try to people please rather than be myself. I’ve been trying to improve this for the past couple years, and I have made significant progress. I started talking to random people, going to events when I’d rather just stay home, and I got jobs in retail. I’ve also read a couple books and I’ve heard plenty of tips on how to be confident. But right now, I feel really insecure, scared, small, alone, and lost. 

I’m also having trouble moving on with life. A huge part of me just wants to keep everything the same, but that’s just not possible. 

I could really use some advice or support. I know it may seem like I’m overreacting, but I really don’t know how to deal with this.",31Aug2019,2

Sometimes I go on peoples social media who I know and who are really successful and whatnot just to see what they're up to lately, and I just cannot believe how much sacrifice they put into whatever they do to where they basically have 0 time for anything. Just how?? and why??? To me, even not being able to sleep for at least 7 hours a night is not worth working at, what, google, having six figures, whatever... I'd rather sleep, do some work in the afternoon and then go do a hobby or something. Life is soooo exhausting already. How are some people just so onnn likee that allll the timeeeee. Is cray.

I've had depression, anxiety and ocd all my life and I'm usually pretty good at dealing with it; I take my meds religiously. I'm just so lonely and I don't know what to do. I'm studying Computer Science and I love it, it's always been something I love. What I really want to do though is music. Not that it'll ever happen.

51,"I have recently been having weird nightmares that wake me up from sleeping, but I’m too tired/scared to open my eyes, and I end up kinda “lucid” dreaming and my imagination will take whatever nightmare I just had and get carried away, making me imagine the monster/creepy thing is in the room with me. I’m not paralyzed, I’m honestly just too scared to open my eyes. I then end up slideshowing through creepy images in my head that I can’t seem to stop. It’s kinda like an impulsive thing. It has almost gotten to the point of making me feel really creeped out in the dark, even when I’m awake, (I’m usually the type of person who will walk through the house without turning lights on so I don’t hurt my eyes).

But now I see you will never budge and also you will fill your ears with that stuff - divisive opinion stuff, constantly and of your own volition. You seek out topics you know are divisive. I hate hearing it. I thought I didn’t mind but I really hate hearing it from the background about some screechy man yelling about things being unfair and unjust.  
  
And, more than that, I’m sick today. You barely spare me a look. You don’t even ask me how I am or how I feel. You go straight on to show me a political video you found funny. I don’t think it’s funny.  
  
I wish I had someone who cared for me and asked me how I am and was more attentive to me than you are. As it is I literally have to ask you for your attention or you will not give it to me. I keep waiting for you to come to me first, give me a hug, whenever you do it’s sexual though. You’re not curious about me, my culture, who I am. Just what I can provide for you. Sexual gratification and an ear for you to talk to.  
  
Just feels like crap. I’m sick. I feel shitty and terrible and I wish you might have been more attentive. I don’t like your family that much either. They’re just very different from me. Just like how you are very different from me. I want someone who relates to me and likes me. You don’t relate to me at all and you have no idea what I might be feeling.

I just moved to Ottawa, ON, Canada to study. I come from far away.

At the student's dorms, on my first day, I met a few people.

When I met the first girl (G1), she directly blushed and ran away. When we saw each other later that day, I told her that we should know each other a bit and that she was nice. We both catched feelings very very fast. At day 2, we were pratically always together and it felt good to be loved, but it felt wrong to be loved by *her*.

We saw each other every day for a week and I also met other boys and girls. College students are way nicer than high schol students. I kind of introducted G1 to all my friends since she was a bit shy and didn't tried to meet people at all.

On my program, I approached a very shy girl (G2) and we both foud out we had very much in common. She told me she liked hanging out with me. I spent a whole day with G2 without telling her about G2. Nothing really happened with G2, but G1 notices I spent the whole day with G2 and was really mad.

G1 told me I was an asshole for making her fall in love with me by teasing her and kissing her.

56,"Okay, so here is my predicament. Back in November 2014, I left my ex-husband (I was 22 at the time) and moved back home with my family. At that time, I developed sleep maintenance insomnia. It used to be really bad, waking up multiple times without being able to go back to sleep. It's been on and off since then, but recently, it has started to become a regular thing with me, I thinking maybe within the last year or so. I don't think leaving my ex-husband has anything to do with the fact that I still have it, but who knows.

It's pretty much the same every night. I usually will wake up some time within the 3 a.m. hour. Sometimes it will be around 1, but not as often. If it's not myself that wakes me up, it's my cat. My boyfriend and I keep him in a separate section of our apartment and he howls and tries to open our door. We have no other place to keep him and he wakes us up if he sleeps with us. Either way, I'm usually awake between 3 and 3:30, and when I wake up I always have to go to the bathroom. I'm trying really stop drinking after like 6, but my body gets so thirsty it's hard to do that. If I don't go, it's pretty much all I think about. The second thing is the insomnia part. Once I wake up, it will usually take me about an hour to go back to bed, and by that time, I only have about 20 or 30 minutes to sleep before I get up at 5 a.m. for work (I'm a teacher and get to school around 6:30).

For the most part, I live a very healthy lifestyle. I'm 28 years old with minimal stress in my life and I'm generally a very easy-going and happy person. I follow the paleo diet about 80% of the time and limit my intake of processed and refined foods, and have lost about 25 pounds through that. I drink plenty of water and always turn off electronics by 8:00, when I usually start to get ready for bed. I try to stop eating by 7 (ideally 6), and I usually only drink a mug of coffee in the morning and I'm finished with it by 8 or 8:30. I'm working to become consistent with exercise. I also take a holistic/natural sleeping supplement with melatonin in it, and while it has helped my sleep schedule, it does not help me stay asleep.

My first frustration lies in the fact that I am already doing the things that many of these websites suggest for better sleep, but it's not helping. Once I am up at the 3 a.m. hour, my body is still physically exhausted, but mentally my brain is raring to go. Most mornings I wake up with a song playing in my head and can't get it out of my head. My mind constantly races, making it very difficult on trying to fall back asleep. However, my second frustration is that I am sick of these sites suggesting ways to get back to sleep, when all I want to do is stay asleep in the first place. I am tired of reading the same things on every website, and just want a way to make this insomnia go away for good. Any help or advice would be kindly appreciated.",31Aug2019,2
57,"Super bold and ignorant claim. I know and I’m not mentally stable anymore. I’ll apologize in advance for how insignificant I’ll sound soon.

Starting from the beginning, my parents are divorced and growing up with a single mother does not equate to financial freedom. I’ve had hobbies that I wished I could have turned into passions, but I lacked the will and financial standing. I lack motivation. I feel that I’ll never amount to anything. I have no specific skills or talents that make me stand out from others. I am slightly good at academics, but it always hits me that in the end that I am not that big fish in the big pond.

Despite that, I wanted to make a change and the military was what I saw as my own game changer. Well, I was all good for a while. Medically qualified through MEPs, ASVAB scores were decent, and I booked the number one job on my list. Then the knee pain that occurs once in a while after a bad fall I had in 2017 comes back stronger than ever before while I was a month out from shipping out, 

Fast forward, ten days before I’m leaving and that leaving part in not happening. I’m back to square one. I feel like a useless punk who can’t even carry out the one thing they chose to do. Useless. I did everything I could with trying a physical therapist who never gave me any physical therapy since it took weeks to schedule an appointment, allow for my insurance to approve for an X-Ray and MRI and so on. Even tried a chiropractor, but unless miracles were going to occur, I am not going to heal anytime soon. Sent the deal breaker text to my recruiter today that I can’t report to my ship date and we’ll see if I’m still wanted by the military at all. I don’t even know the cause of my pain yet since it’ll be another week until I can discuss the MRI results with my PT. If surgery is on the table, the despair is going to increase.

I’m 18 and everyone says I’m still young enough to change my life. I am looking through that teenager spectacle and everything just looks more magnified in that I could potentially lose that change I was looking for in a career. College is a great option, but I already feel like I’m behind everyone else by missing that fall quarter admission. Once again, I am looking at myself through the lens of an unstable teenager. My troubles sound insignificant and pitiful even to me and that is yet to include the more mature people of reddit who know I am over emotional.

He put his picture on the highest display shelf of our hutch and joins me in drinking my boyfriends favorite beer every year on boyfriends birthday.  My husband is pretty fucking awesome. 

As each anniversary of his death has passed things have gotten a little easier. Like they say, time heals all wounds right? I normally put on something nice that day and make a donation to his favorite charity. This year just seems a little harder. I think it’s because it’s been 10 years. I think it could also be because yesterday was also the 1 year anniversary of my dog dying and there’s just lots of death surrounding the end of August for me. 

And don’t think I’m one of those people who can’t handle death. I work with funeral home directors on the regular and actually someone’s ashes hang out in my office with me for a day because her husband couldn’t handle having her in the house before her memorial service. 

Like I said I think it’s just because it’s been 10 years, and then the anniversary of losing my dog yesterday on top of it is just hitting me a little harder today. Thanks for listening, you guys are awesome and I hope you have a great day.",31Aug2019,8
59,"I’m very confused, I get very emotionally attached to people (strangers even) whether online or in person . It’s very annoying cuz they never are as into me as I am to them. Then I end up feeling very stupid and frustrated and stupid that I’m getting emotionally dependent on a stranger. I need to break this habit. It’s very exhausting to have. Anyone know how to stop so emotionally involved with people? Right now I’m feeling so stupid and very annoyed with myself. I’ve had a little self talk to make myself realize that people will not like you just cuz you like them. But it happens all the time . I just want to learn to stop getting so heavy with my feelings... any advice??",31Aug2019,1
60,"I just got back my grade for my research master thesis, and I am graduating at the top op my class! This is such a big deal for me because it has taken me such a long time to do so due to severe chronic illnesses that put me in the hospital for extended periods of time troughout my studies. In extend, my parents really didn't believe I could graduate at all, which got me really stressed and sad at times. Graduating in time feels like I proved everyone who was sceptical about my abilities wrong and has given me such a boost in self-esteem. 

Also, I managed to get hired into my dream job at my prefered company while finishing my thesis. So instead of having to start looking for jobs now I am starting this Monday! It really feels like all my hard work is paying off and life is going well for me.",31Aug2019,15

62,"Just based off my own experience. Obviously have not done a ton of research on how this could work in America. But I’ve been in many industries. I know how many hours are wasted each week as we try to hit that 40 hour mark to justify our pay or benefits. I’ve been at a desk on Reddit for hours right after my real work finished and I have to commit to my sentence for the remainder of the day, essentially Lol. 

Plus even if you have work for at least 7 hours a day, you’re tired and sluggish by the end and your product’s quality shows. I temporarily worked in manufacturing and I can attest to how many mistakes are made when people are working their 12 hour shifts exhausted af. Mistakes cost more to fix them. I can’t imagine how medicine (haven’t worked in that field.)

71,"I have MS. My immune system has gone haywire and basically attacks my brain. I am a 37 year old single mother of 3, diagnosed 1 year ago when I lost vision in my right eye. I have always been happy, healthy, athletic, well spoken... you name it. I've had intermittent symptoms for 5 or so years but I've always bounced back. 

Right now, I'm in the middle of the worst flare up (when the disease is actively attacking me) I've had, and I'm utterly terrified. 

It started with weakness in my right arm, then decreased vision and pain in my eye. Then came cognitive issues and a terrifying numbness on the right side of my face. Now I can't speak. I literally, cannot speak. When I try to speak, I can't find the words so there are these long pauses, and I'm slurring. I'm used to the other issues and I can hide them, but I can't hide this. 

I can't seem to stop crying this morning. I've been sitting here trying to talk (alone) for 45 minutes and I can't get the words out. I'm researching and from what I'm seeing, this is just how it's going to be and I'll need to see a speech pathologist to learn how to ""cope"". I don't have time for that. I have one kid just starting college, another a senior with more activities than I thought possible at her age, and a 15 year old boy with autism and tourette's that requires constant attention. I can't do this. 

I feel overwhelmed, alone, and scared for the future. This is the first time since being diagnosed that I realized how MS can affect *me*. I thought I could just deal with whatever was thrown at me and I'd be fine. I eat properly, I exercise, I practice breathing techniques (check out Wim Hof), I believe our brains truly control our bodies, so if you can control your brain there's nothing your body can't do. But FUCK,  what do you do when your brain is the problem? 

I just didn't know who else to tell. I don't want to burden those who love me, I don't want them to see me scared. I'm the one that fixes other people's problems, if I panic I know they will too. But I can't freaking speak.

Edit: I did have another MRI done yesterday to check for new damage and I'm meeting with my Neuro Thursday to discuss. I am also actively doing infusion (IV) treatments to try to stop progression, which are terrible. They are basically chemo drugs which totally crash my immune system. Point is, I'm doing what I can medically... but psychologically I'm seriously struggling.",31Aug2019,17

75,"21 now.. and I still think about it all the time. 

I was 16. Dating a completely abusive, (physically, mentally, verbally) guy... starting at 13. 

He started being shady and talking to girls behind my back. This turned into him seeing the same girl over and over. I was trying to beg and beg to save the relationship (i was 16 and thought my world was ending). I slept with him once in the 4 month period of this happening and of course I ended up pregnant. 

I called him to tell him and his response was “let me know how much money you need”. 

My heart sank. 

I saw him trying to talk about it and he was still his same crazy self. He started punching me, telling me instead of paying for an abortion he would punch me in the stomach until “it” died. 

My whole entire life I was so against abortions (once again I was only 16 and immature). I couldn’t believe this was happening to me. He was the only guy I had been with. 

I come from what I guess I’d call a below average family $$ wise and knew I would have absolutely 0 support. I also knew I did not want to have a child with a man that was capable of what he was capable of. I knew I’d have him tied to my life and this poor baby’s life forever. 

Edit.. I grew up with divorced parents and a Dad who was in and out of jail. By this time i was aware that my Dad had been abusing my mom the whole time they were together. (I had a very happy childhood thanks to my mom) but I always promised myself I’d be happily married in a stable relationship before bringing a baby into this world. 

I (stupidly) allowed this guy to abuse me but I couldn’t bare the thought of bringing a baby into this situation. 


Being 16, I had to go through an awful long process to keep it from my parents... as far as having to go in front of a judge asking them to approve it. 

At 9 weeks I went to planned parenthood to take the first pill. He was no where to be found. The second one within the next 24 hours. No pain meds because they couldn’t give them to me without a parent. 

The pain I felt was like no other. The next couple months I spent crying and hating myself. Still stupidly trying to make things work with the piece of shit that put me through this and let me do it all alone. 

Fast forward to 2016, I said fuck this and moved off to college. I dropped him from my life and it was the best thing i ever did for myself. Fast forward another two years, I moved to a completely different state and have never been happier.....but sadly, so much of me just can’t let go of what I did. 

I see so many woman struggling to be able to get pregnant and I feel like I cannot forgive myself for ending a gift of life that so many are not able to have for themselves. 

I see babies/infants and break down inside about what my baby would have been like. How much different my life would be if i took responsibility for my actions!!!!!!! 

I try to justify it by saying it was “what was best” but was it??? My heart genuinely hurts. 5 years later and I still just can’t get this out of my head.",31Aug2019,4
76,"So I work with this person who is older than me and I find them physically attractive but emotionally awful; terrible temper, arrogant but yet self pitying, a show off (I wonder if they exaggerate/lie), repeats stories over an over and a really moody person who fishes for compliments all the time.

82,"I was gonna post this on r/confessions but then I realised this was more of a story than a confession. (Let me know if I should move it there though)

I know a lot of people so I fit into quite a few social groups and most of them overlap sometimes, but for reasons I explain at the end, these two particular circles can never interact.

My first social circle is my best friends from high school. They're all goody-goodies, never broke rules, never smoked or drank, hell never even snuck out at night. My problem is that unlike me, they're always like that. None of them have a real interest in partying or breaking their routines. Which is fine, I love that they're a nice and smooth kind of fun.

My other social circle on the other hand is for the times I wanna cut loose. I met most of them at someone's party and now we've actually gotten close enough that I can honestly call them friends. When we hang out it's either a club, or a cheap bar, or even just a small party where we can smoke, drink a little, and let loose. It's never the same thing too often with them, and I love that.


Now, why do I keep these two circles secret from each other? Because I have presented two completely different images of myself to them. When I'm with my first social circle, I they see me as an awkward mess, I'm shy, tell a lot of jokes, and follow all the rules. But the other social circle gets the version of me that's a free-spirited rebel (someone actually called me a rebel, felt really cool), I don't take any bullshit, I'm confident, and charismatic enough to make friends with just about anyone. 

I'm not trying to manipulate their perceptions of me, it's just that I kind of flip flop between the two different personas. Sometimes I just wanna sink into the background and relax, and other times something inside me clicks and I feel confident enough to be the free-spirited rebel.",31Aug2019,1
83,"Do you find yourself irritated, annoyed or even angry at that family member or friend who just can't seem to adapt to social standards? I'm not talking about matters of personality, individuality or social points of view etc. I'm talking about people just *can't get their lives together* in terms of the following:

* Working for a living
* Saving
* Finishing their high school education
* Poor verbal and written communication skills
* Waiting until the last minute to do anything of importance that have to do
* Spending all their money on alcohol, weed or drugs
* Having babies out of wedlock with different people
* Staying out of trouble with the law
* Maintaining an acceptable level of self-respect and treating others with respect
* Improving their general attitude and approach to life

… and any other frustrating negative attribute I failed to mention

You might notice that right, wrong or indifferent... some of the same type of people mentioned above are easily offended and very defensive of their attitude, behavior and the way they choose to live their lives. Some are even confrontational as well. With all of these things in mind, we have to realize that there comes a point when we have to accept the fact that that some people... who due to their education level, inability to think above their environment, inherited traits or mental condition just cannot be helped by non-trained persons. We have to understand they can also pose a challenge to those who are actually trained to deal with them as well. 

Aside from those who have limitations that prevent them from changing and improving themselves, there are smart people out there who simply don't WANT to change. I mean like for them... ""it is what it is"", ""whatcha see is whatcha get"" and ""it's a wrap."" It's time to stop allowing other people's faults, flaws or shortcomings to become YOUR problem. That's right. You have to be careful and rather cautious with some people because they will drain you mentally, emotionally and financially. This is not to say we should stop mentoring or caring about others, but we have to recognize when it's time to stop.

86,"Over 3-4 years, I've lost around $1200 gambling. It all started when I was 15 playing Counter Strike and decided to start gambling to have a chance of getting better ""skins"" in the game. I did that on and off till I was like 18 years old, since I realized that I was always going to end up losing anyway. The only thing that kept me going is the fact I had won $500 in an hour once and wanted to see if I could do it again. But I successfully quit and went on with my life gambling free for about a year. I felt no urge to gamble again at all.

However, one of my friends still gambled. He gave me a bunch of free money to gamble with him just for fun and he would let me keep the profit if I won something. I ended up losing everything really quick and deposited another $50 to keep going. I lost that as well.

Now I feel absolutely terrible about myself. I have a 12 hour shift tomorrow and not sure how I will manage. I relapsed. It makes me sick to my stomach to go over my bank statements and adding up the money I've literally spent on nothing. It adds up to around $1200 over these 3-4 years. Back in the day I used to do around $10 a day maybe.

I can't stop thinking about what I could've done with this money. I could've had it today, but instead I wasted it on disappointment. I could've had a car already. I hate myself for all of this. I also feel like I have no one to relate to, most people don't gamble and let themselves go down that rabbit hole. 

I will not keep gambling. I'm quitting again, but just to think that I've lost this amount from gambling makes me sick to my stomach. I'm already the ""poor"" one out of my friends (I didn't start saving as early as they did). How can I deal with this feeling? This sucks.",31Aug2019,4
88,"I had forgotten about it until today. I used to be a heavy drinker, depressed, and a mess of a person. I remembered today, for some reason, that at a very drunk and very dark stage, maybe 5 or 6 years ago, I called a suicide hotline. I had made the decision to kill myself, had a plan, and felt nothing about it. It was an emotionless and obvious next step for me. But I called because why not. I remember thinking it kind of comical to see if someone could talk me out of it. 

I remember it was a woman. She sounded very tired. I was lamenting heavily about the bullshit of life and was using the F word a lot. For some reason, she was fixated on this. She asked me to stop cursing, politely at first. I wouldnt because in my head what was politeness in comparison to my life. 

She said something like ""I'm not going to continue if you keep speaking with that language."" And I laughed and said ""fuck that"". And she hung up on me. For some reason, that was the thing I needed to not kill myself that night. I drank some more into a stupor and fell asleep. 

Someone cared more about curse words than my life, and it's the reason I'm still alive today.",31Aug2019,9

91,"My last year of highschool starts next year, I've been doing terrible in all my classes over the past years even though I put all my effort into them, I applied at 3 different places over the summer and none of them ever got back to me, I got a job for October at a haunted house attraction but that's only because my dad is one of the organizers, I just feel like a worthless piece of garbage right now and am scared for what my future will bring",31Aug2019,2
92,I miss him and I always think about how like right now I’d usually be getting ready to go out with him. I’d be FaceTiming him. I’d be talking to him. I had the chance to kiss him whenever I wanted. I got to hold him and ask him how’s his day. Now I don’t get to do any of that. I miss him. I love him. I wonder what he’s doing right now. I miss you Luis.,31Aug2019,5
93,"I have a severe clinical phobia of vomiting. It’s actually more common than you’d expect. I went to a party last night and as I was coming back I saw this girl in the elevator and she threw up. I panicked, ran down the stairwell and had a serious panic attack, hyperventilating and trembling and everything. But my friends were with me and they were able to calm me down after about an hour. I still have a hard time thinking about what happened and I don’t think I’m gonna be able to use that elevator for a little while. But even though I panicked and bolted, I still saw my worst fear, and I feel weirdly proud of myself for that! I didn’t die, I’m not traumatized, I am okay ... and it gives me hope that one day I’ll recover !",31Aug2019,7
95,"Of course I apoligised profusely and I always try to shut the door if he comes storming down the stairs (the dog, not the housemate), but today he was too fast and I was too late.

96,"I'm 24 and I've felt like this for over 15 years. Just want to rest in peace and finally be able to go home. I'm tired of abusing drugs and alcohol, it doesn't really bring me pleasure but at least it's anesthesia for my sick soul.

I don't think I was ever supposed to have made it this far, I'm ready to check out. I don't like anything about myself or who I am, things that are out of my control. 

My family is an ash; engulfed by rancorous thoughts that's are so omnipresent I don't even remember what I'm upset about. Everybody's gone, sorry I couldn't say goodbye, sometimes I picture all of us in a swimming pool just laughing and splashing.

Pain and living become synonymous, lucidity is elusive. I wrestle with the devil in my dreams but waking up doesn't bring much recluse. 

Light turns to dark and then back again, a sunrise awakens me to the precipice. Well my trains here now, maybe I'll be back or maybe there's other plans. Ready to see everyone I never learned to love in life.",31Aug2019,1
98,"I'm antsy as hell and have nothing to do. I'm bad at relaxing. I've cleaned, baked, made dinner, watched TV, browsed the Internet, played video games, and I still feel like a waste of space.

99,"I don't know if this is normal or not, but my brain feels vacant. I'm not an idiot, for the most part, but I often feel like there's something missing, or there's something in the way. Take simple math for example. I've been doing it for a long time, but its like it never clicked for me, it just feels like muscle memory. I'm decent, but it doesn't seem like it came from a place of understanding. I've gone through the trouble of relearning some things, thinking that it was probably due to never understanding the method, but even after I write down all the steps, and the logic, it just feels like I'm memorizing it. Things I've done for years, still feel unfamiliar. Its like I've never had that Eureka moment, I just kinda pushed on anyway. I've even taken courses on how to learn, and all of it is so stupidly simple, but it doesn't click. Everything I teach myself just kinda disappears into a void in my head. Am I just reaching here?",31Aug2019,5

101,"Tonight I have family over which I love because I only get to see them once in a while and time with them is gold. But as someone whose spent the last four years living mostly alone needed my quiet time and went to bed early.

In my quiet time not only did I go through an existential crisis but also spent the past half hour under the covers, balling my eyes out, scrolling through r/oldmandog and listening to Jeremy Riddle. It wasn't until a couple of minutes ago that my nephew came into my room and without a word got into my bed and fell right to sleep. 

I mean it's strange to have someone in my bed as it doesn't happen often but there is something very comforting knowing that he could have easily chosen to sleep with his grandma or his parents but he chose me. Having a kid love and trust you so much is precious, it's made things seem not so bad.",31Aug2019,8
102,"A series of terrible events happened to me. I lost all my friends after my ex outed me for shitty things i did (it was really shitty stuff and i deserved it, still hurt tho) broke my wrist in 2 places and fractured it in 3 other places a few days after as well as i completly ruined the growth plate and my hand wont grow much more than it already has (there is already a considerzble size difference between my hands). Then I made new friends and my then new girlfriend of 4 months cheated on me with 3 of them, I then dislocated my hip and tore muscles in my thigh, putting me in a wheelchair for around 3 months and taking me out of cross country which i planned on running in the junior olympics. Cut my finger real bad and got tendon and nerve damage (still in physical therapy for my wrist/finger and hip btw) diagnosed with PTSD due to a friend commiting suicide 4 years ago. Then after all of this i lost the 3 best friends i had recently made. In a time span of less than 12 hours they all left ""because they didnt want to be my therapist"" and because they found out that i felt bad about what i did to my ex that i mentioned in the begining. All of this happened between january 2015 and 1 month ago

Despite all of this i am really happy where i am :)
I have learned a lot about life because i used to not be a good person at all, ive met new friends that are really good people and value who i am now. But ive done a lot to move on and get happy. Music and playing instruments got me through all of this and to anyone reading this, i hope you find something like that to help you through your adversities and obstacles, you deserve it and you are all amazing ! Have a wonderful day everyone ! Find that thing you love !!   :D",31Aug2019,1

104,"Im always looking for a place to share and express myself during the limited time I get away from my various ranching duties and this looked like a good place to do that.

Like my title describes there are 3 sets(six individual testicles each) of preserved Stallion Testicles suspended in the Silicone Gel of each of my Implants, the testicles come from geldings of a personal breeding project ive been running for a few years on my ranch the premise of which was to develop a large breed with as large a set of genitals as possible. 

I'm willing to answer almost anything but I cannot give identifying details(legal reasons) about what company I commissioned my implants from nor any about my plastic surgeon though I will say they were not located in the united states.

Some answers for the common questions I get

Q1.Why:

A.I have an extreme fetish for horse genitals specifically there testicles it has a lot to do with the way I perceive fertility and masculinity in an almost primal animalistic way to me the bigger they are, the more veins the way they hang all of that contributes to make them more attractive to me. I think aesthetic is a word I could use to simplify the whole thing I basically am really attracted to their aesthetic but it does go deeper than that which I imagine a lot of people would feel if they really thought through their particular fetish.

But besides my fetish the idea actually stemmed from a joke someone made to me about making use of my geldings testicles that gave me the original idea. It was something I kind of obsessively fantasized about for a few months before reaching out to various companys to get the fantasy actualzied.

Q2.Whats wrong with you?:

A.My family doctor has suspected for a long time I have some form of autism but besides that I'm not really sure I have any serious mental issues as funny as that might sound coming from me. Besides my fetish and my the contents of my chest, my life is pretty much totally ordinary if not more work oriented then a lot of other people and I don't really have any crazy manic episodes or hear voices or anything like that.

Q3.Aren't the testicles rotting?:

A.No, they were soaked and injected with a preservative solution before being sent off to be suspended in the silicone gel of my new set of implants.

Q4.Isn't that animal abuse?:

A.No the horses would have been gelded regardless its standard practice to geld non breeding males.",31Aug2019,3
