2,"I’ve never dated a single mom before nor do I have any kids of my own.  The first three dates were a lot of fun.  There’s a ton of chemistry there.  Tonight’s date was just going to be me making her dinner at my place and watch a movie.  Maybe a little more I thought lol.  

She showed up with her 4 year old daughter.  No mention of it before hand and didn’t say anything about an emergency with a sitter or anything.   Just acted like it was normal.  

I was a little put out by it, but I’m a make the best out of any situation kind of guy.   So I head back to the kitchen to finish up dinner.  Not five minutes in there and I hear a thud.  I go out and check and my date is picking my phone off the floor.  I left it in the living room.  She apologized and said her daughter dropped it.  It still works, by why was she letting her kid play with my phone?

Go back out to finish up and a little bit later hear another thud.  I go check again and her daughter had knocked my lamp off my end table.  I don’t think she was paying attention to her at all.  

I finally get dinner finished and we start eating.  Her daughter wouldn’t touch it.  So date asked me if I had any French fries for her.  So I went and made her daughter some fries.  

After dinner we tried to talk while playing a kids movie on Netflix, but her daughter wasn’t having it and it just didn’t go anywhere.  They left a little bit ago since it’s close to her daughters bedtime.  

Like I said this is the first time dating a single mom.   Im not sure how normal it is to bring your kid on one so early on.   Or if this was just a shit test for me.   If it was a shit test it worked.  I’m having major doubts about continuing to date her.  I’m not sure I’m up for the craziness just yet.  ",16Mar2019,2
3,"So the first one is the one that is bothering me the most, many days I just feel kind of somber and depressed and the day  just seems to go by insanely quickly, like time just flies by, I also get very little during work done during the day, like I have 12-16 hours a day to just study and I can barely even finish half a chapter of my textbook. I get a few lucky days when I feel pretty okay and the day seems to go by nice and slow. 

I also want to talk about my physical health, I am pretty skinny (5'9 and 126 lbs) , despite this my jawline some days is really nice and strong/sharp and masculine, and other days it's pretty meh and seems to have receded a bit, my hair a few days ago was really really thick but now it seems to have thinned quite a bit and just my overall hair thickness seems to fluctuate quite a bit, there are days where I shed a bit of hair as well.

For some reason when I first started uni in September, I just started to have a lot of health problems like chronic fatigue, high bp and high heart rate, tingling in my back, an insatiable appetite especially for sugar, and skin problems. After a few moths of that, I started taking a multivitamin which helped with some of my issues and got a blood test done which revealed a mild anemia, but even after taking a mutlivitamin and iron and zinc supplements for a few months, I still seem to have these bizzare issues.

Sorry if this post is a clusterfuck, but I would greatly appreciate any insight

6,"I've had a lot of trouble with feeling like I was never enough. As a kid, I've always been good at what I do.  I got honours for every year until High School. The thing is that people often told me that I didn't have common sense and this has always been stuck with me. I can't get over this voice in my head that tells me that I'm destined to fail. Every mistake I make feels like my demise. If I do anything wrong, I always think that ""This is finally it."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently in second year of software engineering at a fairly reputable university and I can't help but compare myself to my peers. We are supposed to go out on a CoOp work term and all my friends got really cool jobs while I got one of the crappiest one. I honestly don't really mind the job; it's just that my I feel like my friends are off to do great things and I'm gonna be stuck doing some dead end job and have nothing at the end of the sufferring of university. I feel like everyone else is great at what they do and I'm just here existing, feeding off the bottom. 

&amp;#x200B;

The worst part is that I know I'm being dumb. I know that I shouldn't envy others, but it's definitely easier said than done. My friends are off doing great things and I'm stuck here struggling. No one even bothered to offer me an interview during the time that companies were hiring. It was definitely due to my lack of student group work.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how people do that. I can barely handle my studies so I don't know how people can do so much extra curriculars. I'm competing with them so it's definitely something I should be doing but I barely sleep with school. Am I supposed to just suck it up? Add more stress to try and compete with people? Just be ok with being mediocre? I really don't know what to do with myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I spent so much time on school last year. I came out with a GPA of 3.8 and I couldn't be any more proud of it until I realized that it was gonna get me nowhere. I tried joining a student group project to no avail. School kept getting insane and I keep prioritizing it over everything else. I just can't help feeling like a massive failure among all these cool people who are off to do cool things.

&amp;#x200B;

One more thing, this is out first work term. I'm really worried that employers will see that I don't have any experience with proper software development and they won't hire me for the next work term, then the next work term, and finally, when I graduate. Some of my friends worked at their parent's companies while I worked at McDonald's. I honestly don't even mind the work but people are really judgmental sometimes. I can feel my friends somehow pitying me for working there.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of all this, I recently told a close friend of mine that I was gay. For the most part, this has been an okay experience with other people. I usually get the ""i dont care"" response which I am more than happy with. The problem with this one friend is that we've gone to church together. He said that he doesn't care but I can feel that he does. Something has definitely changed and I'm not really happy about it because I consider him one of my closer friends.

9,"I was high for the first time.  I was lost in my thoughts and anxiety that revealed themselves from my subconscious.  Being around you makes me a bit nervous, you know, and the feeling of being high amplified all emotions within me.  I became a hyper-sensitive being, and I did not know how to confront what was happening to me.  And well...

I was laughing like a maniac on the sidewalk.  I was walking next to you, everything was just funny to me.  I was being as goofy as I can, laughing about how much I wanted cherry sours.  We stopped into the 7/11 to buy some snacks, so I go look for my treasured candy, but... it was out of stock.  I couldn't help but be overwhelmed by sadness, and I started crying.  Neither could I understand why I was crying, but I started laughing too.  You saw the tears streaming down my face though, and

you hugged me and I could not believe how it felt.  I felt like as if my life was a picture book, and for a second somebody detached the page where you hugged me and started holding my hand to help guide me.  It was all such a blur, a pink, rosy blur.  All my wild emotions halted except for this feeling that I can only describe as... ""it just feels right.""  I felt like I belonged, overwhelmed by a sense of peace.  No baggage behind me to cause me to second guess my thoughts, no worrying about what is to come.

11,"It's been so long since I've felt satisfied with my life. In January I was planning my third suicide attempt and I'm so glad I didn't follow through. 

Being sexually abused and assaulted, and living in a complicated household resulted in me having severe depression and anxiety, and eating disorders. I've abused alcohol and drugs, self-harmed, and neglected my health. I was a mess.

But here I am now. I'm happy and I'm content with how life is right now. My medication is working, I've accepted my past experiences, and my body is becoming healthier. 

I'm okay with this. It was a long journey, but I'm happy to be alive.",16Mar2019,14
12,"A month ago, my best friend confessed to me that she was suicidal. She got help, has been on medication, and is so much better than she ever has been. It's incredible, really. She loves life, she laughs a lot, and is passionate again. I'm so, so proud of her in every single way. 

We sat up all night talking last night, about depression, anxiety, and everything else in between. While we were having this intense heart-to-heart she told me that she felt that spark for life again. That every moment felt like a new opportunity--that she felt like life was so clear for once. 

As she was saying these things, I felt my heart break a little. Because I realized that I hadn't felt alive in months. I forgot what it felt like to feel true passion. Since summer ended I've been living in a gray cloud and a dark haze. I remember moments months ago where I'd look back and ask ""what happened to my spark? What happened to my passion and my love of life?"" 

She was describing to me how it felt to live without anxiety and it made me realize just how much I am currently living *with* anxiety. It's only now I look back on my relationships since summer and really start to wonder how this constant fear of everything around me has affected them. It makes me wonder if a part of the reason it didn't work out with my ex was because this sense of anxiety was ruining my life while we were together, and I didn't even know it was happening. It makes me wonder if I got so frustrated with certain friendships because anxiety had me thinking all sorts of ridiculous things about people that I know love and care about me. 

I'm going to a therapist, and I have been for a while. I always push people to seek help and I did when I felt like I needed it. What I've slowly noticed, though, is that I never really talked about myself in sessions. I only talked about those around me and how they were struggling. How my roommate has severe depression, my best friend was suicidal, and my ex was struggling as well--and I remember thinking-- ""I'm not suicidal, I'm not so depressed I can't get out of bed, and I have some kind-of 'good days'--*I can't justify feeling this way. I'm just lazy.""* 

Seeing my best friend in a better place made me realize how not-okay I am. Seeing my best friend in a better place made me realize that I don't have to be suicidal or in bed 24/7 to be diagnosed with depression. Seeing my best friend again made me realize just how much I haven't been myself since summer, and how scary it is that I can't even find joy in creating music. Everything is just... gray. Dull. Boring. Pointless. 

So today, I reached out to my therapist. I'm working on getting to see a psychiatrist. I'm actually motivated to try and get better because I really miss the girl I was before I started feeling this way. I miss looking at the sun rise and running by the lake and feeling so free and open and alive. I miss writing music and getting lost in the rise and fall of the chords. I miss being genuinely excited about chasing down a good news story and not constantly faking enthusiasm in my class. 

Why am I writing all this? I just needed to vent, get it out there. And maybe... I don't know, maybe someone feels the same way and thinks that just because they haven't hit the lowest-of-the-low points yet that they don't need help. Maybe someone else will feel validated in their experiences and realize that life isn't meant to be lived in gray. 

I just want to learn to be okay again, and I think I can get there. No, I *know* I can get there.  I'm just glad I've realized I'll need a bit more help to make it. ",16Mar2019,6
13,"So I'm an avid golfer and I recently moved from FL to NYC last summer and because of a multitude of factors I haven't been able to actually golf since October or so. My wonderful wife recognized the symptoms of me losing my mind, so for christmas she gave me a really nice indoor putting matt. It's pretty large and being in an upstairs apt, depending on where I set up I get different breaks (where the floor slopes a different direction and lets ball roll a different path and what not).  So my wife gets a pretty good kick out of watching me putt when we are bored on a random Wednesday night, and she knows that it's not a perfect fix, it really helps me from going too stir crazy. 

But some months her schedule is radically different than mine and I am home alone pretty often. It isn't the worst thing, but I can only play video games, watch Netflix and read so often. So what started as drills to keep myself from just making the same putts over and over again, I brought out 4 balls and came up with a series of drills that I run at lengths getting longer and longer.  It didn't take very long that I started giving different lengths different point values, telling myself I couldn't move to the next drill until I scored a certain number of points. 

Now I have 4 different 'games' that I play and compete as multiple personas. I have little announcers in my head that commentate and give analyses (i suppose that is my way of figuring out where I'm wrong with lines or speed). I started keeping track on my tablet, with brackets and point totals and a strange amount of stats. I've gone through 8 'seasons' now in about a month. sometimes I go on for hours, getting into such a groove and genuinely enjoy myself.  The games are actually really fun from a golfers standpoint and I think that if I were to have my golf buddies come over, these would go over really well. 

The thing is, sometimes I feel like a crazy person with all the extra stuff, like the brackets and 30 or 40 competitor personas I've created for the game. I know its no worse than any of the time I've put into shit like video games, but I'm kind of curious whether random internet folks think I am crazy before I start bringing this stuff up with people IRL. 

tldr; I get bored a lot while I am home alone and came up with putting games to entertain myself. May have gone a bit overboard, but I'll leave it up to you to decide. ",16Mar2019,1
14,"Alright so, this won’t be much of a discussion or whatever, but I usually take being ignored way to personally, it’s just the feeling of people not responding or leaving me on read that really disturbs me. And these extends to friends aswell, like I take friends very personally a lot of the time and I feel like if they don’t give me attention then that means they dislike me, even tho they have told me that they do. It’s not just being left on read tho, in general I take mostly everything personally, even tho there’s nothing to be worried about, I would get upset at myself for the littlest things. This has also carried onto online friends aswell, which I have had a lot more feeling for in the past few months, and have taken there actions much more personal.

I always see the negative in every situation. Every Sunday from wake up to sleep I am miserable because I know I have to go to work tomorrow. I hate waking up early and going to work and when I’m at work I often say I wish I was dead rather than doing this. It’s not the type of work it‘s just having to work my life away, barely seeing my family and having to do this longer than I have even been alive. I don’t think it’s my job because I make decent money, work from home and have flexible hours. 

The reason this has just been realized by me is because I have a medical condition and will need a kidney transplant fairly soon. I’ve been on dialysis before and I told my wife and mom I would rather just die then go through that again and I really mean it. But when I think of death it sounds “nice”. No more worries, no more stress, no more working or being tired or being miserable. I am NOT suicidal but between discomfort and dearth, I would take death. I am going to talk to my wife about it tomorrow but I don’t know. Need to vent and any comments, ideas or thoughts are welcome. Thanks.

22,"small reflection/personal rant from the past year

I use to have so much free time that I would always complain of being bored. We would be able to go do things on a whim. I would also be able to relax, stay up late, and sleep in every weekend.

fast forward to giving birth, I had traded in all my free time for a bundle of joy with a side effect- sleep deprivation.

once mom mode kicked into gear, I think my brain was rewired to have everything revolve around supporting/protecting my little one. like seriously, what is me time or we time for that matter? I dont know anymore. plus, 15 months later and I'm still too attached to even bother finding time. Anything we do with our time would revolve around our baby, even sleep. We always wake up throughout the night to check on him. 

Definitely leaves no time to complain about being bored and trying to fill up my day. Nowadays I'd be surprised if I could actually sleep through the night. Sleep is really something taken for granted, but as much as I enjoy sleeping, I love and enjoy our baby adventures even more. I would never trade up all those cuddles, kisses, and hugs. Furthermore, I would never trade up all those existing and future memories we constantly collect as a family. 💙",16Mar2019,4
23,"I’ve been in pretty much a high anxiety state since fall of 2017. 

That’s when school and career stuff started to pile up. I remember getting this constant “fuzzy” feeling in my head and I concluded it was just because of anxiety. I remember I had 2-3 anxiety attacks that semester. I was taking 21 credits and working 2 jobs and was heavily involved in 2 on campus clubs. 

My stress started to easy around February when I landed this really good semester long co-op internship for the fall of 2018, so my stress levels were pretty normal for the rest of the semester.

Obviously I was nervous to start the new job come summer. But it went pretty good the first few months. I was pretty much stress free all of June and July. 

Then comes August, where I meet this girl. I fell pretty hard and pretty quick for her. Went on a bunch of dates in the beginning but then around late August it didn’t go right. And pretty much September - December we had this off on and one relationship where we would spent 3-4 days back to back together and then where she wouldn’t message me for weeks

I was constantly on edge, feeling like I was walking on egg shells afraid if I say the wrong thing she will just ghost me. I had a bunch of anxiety attacks, threw up quite often from them. I lost a bunch of wait merely from stress and depression. I’ve battled “abandonment issues” for awhile since I was younger. My parents had a pretty nasty split.

But this was probably the worst depression I had in my life. Both my parents, brother, uncle, aunts, cousins, friends could tell I was going through something. I called into work sick somedays merely because I couldn’t get out of bed. I journaled and journaled my emotions, contemplated suicide a bunch of times just so I wouldn’t feel depressed. And that pretty much consisted of all of October-November. You can say the relationship we had was toxic, bad for my mental health, but not everything is black and white. Had sporadic/barely any contact with her from mid October - Early December with her. 

Fast forward to December. I landed another semester long internship at my favorite company in the world half way across the country. Right around the same time, her and I started seeing a lot more each other. And things were going really good between us, but that constant feeling of her leaving was always present. 

I move to my new job Mid January, I pretty much spent a week straight at her house prior to me leaving. Even spent the night prior to the day I had to get on the plane. 

We texted almost everyday for the first two weeks. Then she spills the “you’re not my boyfriend, and never will be” on me just as I’m starting my new gig all alone far away from home. So I was pretty much depressed again for another week or two. I talked to her about visiting her on Valentine’s Day before I left and she said she was all for it. So when she told me “you’re not my boyfriend” I pretty much gave up all hope on going back to see her.

I cut contact for about two weeks, and she initiated contact with me saying how much she misses me and she wants to see me Valentine’s.

So what do I do? I buy a 700 dollar plane ticket, leave mid work week by making up same lame excuse about a family emergency to go back home and see her. 

Out of the six days I was back, I spent 5 of them with her. I leave back to my job and new happy of the experiences I made with her but still anxious like she’s gonna drop me.

Fast forward to today.. I have about a month left into my job. And it’s going really well. I still talk to her a bit. I’ve been talking to her a lot, she says how much she misses me, the things we’re gonna do when I get back etc etc.. green lights 

But currently she’s in Mexico spending spring break with about 12 of her friends.. and I’m trying not to think about all the dudes she’s hooking up. 

While I’m in this city with what seems like a million people and I don’t know anyone. I did meet another girl and went on a few dates wit her. But I don’t want to make any other attachments because I’m leaving so soon and don’t want to be that guy that breaks someone’s heart, because I know the pain and it’s awful.

I feel like I’m not even stressed or depressed I just feel like it’s all normal... i workout a lot and spend a lot of hours in the office to distract myself but it doesn’t always work.

My apartment is a damn mess, my sleeping schedule is pretty fucked too. 

If you made it this far reading, I’m sure you’re thinking I’m a complete idiot for continuing talking to her because of how toxic this relationship sounds. But again, it’s not all
black and white. Even though I’m pretty much blinded by my feelings towards her, I feel like she does have genuine feelings for me and if I just hangout a little longer I can get something real.

I don’t really post on reddit that much but I have gotten advice on this situation and most of the time it’s “drop all contact and never see her again” and that’s why I hate posting in r/relationshipadvice because it’s so easy for strangers to say that when they don’t know the whole picture.

all in all I notice that part of my hair is thinning near my right temple nothing big. Everyone says I’m an idiot and there’s nothing receding about but I see the differences in previous pictures. My grandpa has good hair and everyone on my family does too so I’m thinking it’s because of this stress.

I just hope everything works out. I go back home for school. There’s no toxicity between her and I. And the stress and anxiety is gone. And my hair in that area gets thicker.I just hope everything works out, and goes my way for once.

25,"I (23F) lost my virginity in the middle of last year, and now regret it.



I understand that in current times (especially on Reddit), sex is looked at as casual, and waiting to lose your virginity to the “right” person is considered outdated and stupid. I know myself well enough to know that I’m picky, and didn’t want it to be a one-night-stand situation, and the opportunity never really presented itself in a way where I felt comfortable before. I finally met someone last year who was patient enough with me, so I chose to finally lose it.



The thing is... I felt pressure. Not from the guy, but due to my age and society. If I had a guarantee that I would have met someone who I would have had a long, stable relationship with in three years, I would have easily waited, but obviously there are never guarantees in life.



I am incredibly depressed now due to this, and other things that have since happened.

33,"So I’ve had quite the day dealing with this. I’m on the other side of the world but this event has affected me much much more than anything similar. 

I’m a 17 year old American male. I hate using labels when it comes to politics, but I think I need to for the context. So I guess I’m a “right leaning libertarian leaning neoliberal” but very loosely I say that because I tend to be contrarian because I’m a dickhead but I like to think of it as trying to show whoever I’m arguing a different perspective by any means. That goes the same way with religion too. I’m a Catholic and I venerate the teachings of Catholicism but I do the same with that. Acting and arguing against what I guess are my core values. Which tends to confuse me meta cognitively because I guess I get lost in what *are*  after all my beliefs and values. 

That’s the part that scared me a lot. While of course I’m not a racist, xenophobe, or any type of bigot, and I call for peace at any cost, I see my own thoughts in common with the shooters after reading his shitty manifesto. While it may not make me change my mind on most things, it’s only been a day after all, it has made me rethink and re evaluate everything I thought of the world of politics up to this point. 

This “person” (I don’t even want to give him that credit) was not just targeting Muslims or the “left.” Yes, directly that’s what he did. But he was an accelerationist. He wanted chaos to ensue and for us all to attack each other. I very easily assume he would want the conservatives in this imaginary war to win and make some ultra right winged state. But he wanted chaos none the less. He wanted us to bring the worst out in each other and that made me realize the ways I was thinking. 

I’ve never considered mass immigration an “invasion” as he really drilled into his manifesto. But I didn’t think that it was ideal. I have always been okay with immigration no matter who you are as long as it’s done properly and legally. But being an avid history buff I do realize I have a slight problem with underlying nationalism and maybe even racism and xenophobia. I’m very Irish, and while I dress it up as memes I do think negatively on the British for their wrongdoings to the Irish in history. And that goes for just about every country and culture I’m informed on. I have a positive bias on Polish people so therefor a negative one on northern Germans. Positive for Greece and Armenia so a heavy negative for Turkey. I often browse on the /his/ board on 4chan and while I don’t participate in the blatant racism like all the racial slurs or WE WUZ stuff but I would get into shit throwing contests about stuff like this and looking back I have said things that I absolutely did mean, disguised it as a sarcastic circlejerk meme, and would be horrified if my name instead of “anonymous” were presented with those posts. And the same goes for if people could read my thoughts about these things even though I still tell myself it’s for the meme.

Regarding memes, it’s actually horrifying watching the footage and being able to identify with and recognize every reference in it. Many are absolutely harmless like the crab meme or gas gas gas. But it’s scary to know that you share those things with someone who could murder 50 people. 

When it comes to the PewDiePie thing, that’s a big can of worms. First off. PewDiePie **is not** a racist, homophobe, antisemite, xenophobe, sexist, islamaphobe, nazi, or any other type of bigot. He makes edgy memes. That’s well and fine as long as those aren’t actual issues *thinly veiled* as memes. But we cannot enter Felix’s mind and none of us know him personally. We as the public have no real reason to see him as a bigot imo. The real issue is that actual bigots will latch onto those memes like the shooter with PewDiePies satire, or me with r/me_ira’s satire. There isn’t anything wrong with the content, but there is with how the content is being perceived by some. I don’t know and I doubt that that is a problem society can fix across the board without going straight up censorship mode, which I think would make the problem worse but that’s a can of worms I don’t want to open right now. 



So here are my main points that I would hope people get from this post:

-	Do not view culture mixing and immigration as invasion. This is dangerous thought that can lead to things like this, and remember that you and your culture is a product of thousands of years of culture mixing and migration.
-	Do not let this divide you more into the tribalistic immaginary political boundries that have been set for you. This is exactly what the shooters goal was.
-	Memes are all fun and well but please, **DO NOT find yourself using memes to justify and spread hatred like I have.** Places like r/me_ira or 4chan meme threads are suited to be places of political satire. Its okay to make an edgy joke but its not okay if you actually might believe in it in any way. Even if its minimal. You can easily find those thoughts being more reasonable and true if you do this.

37,"Throughout my life one thing has become abundantly clear: the stories I tell other people regarding my life are secondary to the listeners.

If it doesn’t entertain it’s a waste of time. If the listener doesn’t directly benefit from me talking about my life — whether via a dopamine release of self gratitude, entertainment, or self improvement — the stories of my life are merely a nuisance and a waste of the listener’s time.

I harbor no animosity towards this anymore. I did. I first really noticed this behavior in my previous girlfriend. It irritated me. I would listen to her talk about the most mundane things and lied to myself I was listening selflessly. That was a lie. I wanted to have sex. I see that now. But at the time I became a bit angry when I saw her eyes gloss over when I was sharing my life. 

I see it in all my relationships: my parents, my SO, my best friends, etc. And even though it’s uncomfortable to admit, I of course see it in myself. It makes sense, logically, but it’s a bit sobering to come to terms with how selfish we all are.",16Mar2019,1

My whole life people have insisted I'm gay and I didn't agree. I hated sex, but it was almost always forced on me by my partners so I didn't think hard about why. In non-forced sex I like it more, but I still don't love it; touching a guy just seems... pointless? I've been through enough therapy to know whole body touch matters for them too, but it just feels silly to do it in the moment. There's just more to touch on a woman and it feels purposeful. 

Sometimes I think about things from the past like sharing a bed with friends in high school and when I touched one of my chubbier friends she was so soft and cuddly I was so sad I couldn't spoon her. Was I gay my whole life or do I love cuddles? I don't know. 

I'm using apps and I matched with girls but I'm too chicken to do anything. It feels embarrassing and wrong. Like hi I'm 28 and confused. I don't know if Ill want sex with you or any woman, but I think you're cute so far, is it gay enough for a date? Christ...

45,"I’m exhausted right now. This isn’t something I’ve ever listed about directly. The last time days have been a mess because of this. This isn’t the first time it has caused a major issue between us. Ive bene trying to tell him he needs help, for two years. He rationalized it any way he could even though he knew it was causing problems. Even though the reasons he gave were horrible. 
I’m too tired to get into the specifics of every time it’s come up. But he’s promised me he’d stop. He’s promised me 3 times. Maybe more, I’m not sure now. He’s promising me again. He admits that he has a problem, now. He’s deactivated a lot of his social media because he tells me it’s a gateway. 

But I can’t. I can’t. I’ve held out for him for two years and it’s too much. He’s lied to me over a lot. This isn’t our only fatal flaw in the relationship and this just adds so much more. I love him so much. But I feel like I mean nothing to him. I’m not worth as much as the stuff he’s compelled to do. Not more then the lies he’s told me, will tell me. 

I’m afraid to talk about this with anyone. When people think about porn and “too much”, I’m sure they don’t think of putting it in ehilenyou drive home from work in the car. Or watching it for 4 or so hours in one go without actually masturbating. Or seeking out sexual attention from women online, which had bene the apex of the problem for some time now. I told my friend about it the other day when I saw my boyfriend had recently, as in the last six days, had been interacting with a woman online in this nature. It ripped me to shreds. My friend, bless his gay heart, gave me humor for the situation. But also put it for me this way, that he’s cheating. If it were texts on his phone, that would be cheating. Just because it’s Instagram or any other platform doesn’t make it any different. I know this. But it was good to hear it from someone else. 

I feel gross and my skin hurts. I want him to get hell. He’s in therapy for trauma related stuff.m, and he just started. But, this needs help right now. We have bene planning on doing couples counseling but I don’t think that  will help this. This is his thing. 

I just feel so broken right now. I have him back the promise ring he gave me (more like tossed at him) and told him to give it back to me when he knew he would stop lying to me and letting me down. And I also said, that we both knew that he wouldn’t be able to ever give it back to me. 

I’m really not okay. He’s the only family I have. I’m not in contact with my blood family, only low contact for my mental health. We’ve been planning our lives together for a while now. We have a beautiful home. And I love our life together, when it’s good. But the joy I feel is equal to the pain I feel. 

I don’t know where to go or who to talk to. I’m just hurting so much. I can’t even think of being supportive for him. I’ve given him everything and I’m drained. 

I don’t know, I just needed to get this out. This is all I can manage right now. I took a gift he had gotten me for our second anniversary, and I room it outside and I smashed it. It just feels like a lie, you know? I want it to stop. I want it to go away. ",16Mar2019,2
46,"I feel like every time I THINK I’m doing so well in life, something always has to “humble me” and make me realize that for my age (23F) I’m actually doing terrible and I will probably never succeed in life. Just had a ‘catch-up’ double date with my boyfriend, my friend and his gf. My friend and his gf are doing SO well: moving out of state, getting adult jobs, living a fun and spontaneous lifestyle. I’m still in school (practically taking 1 class a semester, 4 years in and barely a sophomore) and moving back into my parents house. I hate comparing myself to others, but at my age I should be getting an adult job! And should have already finished school! And maybe got an internship or joined Peace Corps or something of that nature. I was speaking to my friend and he says “How’re you doing? You’re still in school right?” Me: “Yeah”
Him: “And still taking 1 class a semester, right? See I was right!” (He says this, laughing to his girlfriend)  I was just frozen in embarrassment. 

I didn’t realize my failure was so open and noticeable. I’m trying to change my life for the better. Life is really difficult with depression and anxiety. The mixture of the 2 while trying to work + go to school is unbearable sometimes. I recently began taking workout classes (a BIG step for me since I am scared being around strangers), got Invisalign for myself (braces make me nervous too), and bought myself a car (ALL by myself!!), so this year has been a Big-Girl kinda year for me. But when stuff like this happens, it just makes me wanna give up. Am I ever going to get to a place where I can consider myself an adult? Will I ever have an adult career? Or make big steps in life?

48,"I (M18) have recently began to feel like I’m a failure. Here’s why:

1.) My brother is much smarter than I was in high school and I always have to go through my parents comparing me to him. He got into all the colleges I’m getting denied to and it hurts enough, and the comparisons just make it worse. The college that I did get into is out of state and will be super expensive for my parents and dig a hole for them, and the application for the community college around her is over. I don’t know what to do. I wish I tried so much harder.

2.) I hate relationships. I always fuck them up or get fucked over. Unfortunately, I have never fell so hard for a girl than I have recently. She was my ex’s best friend and we went through so much just to be together. She lost a lot primarily because her best friend was together with me. It started off so well, we were so tight and close. However, times been going on and cracks have been showing up in our relationships. She has a college friend who is always up snap chatting her and flirting with her and FaceTiming her. Although she says “he’s just kidding don’t worry”, I don’t know what else to think if it’s constantly happening. I also have another ex-girlfriend who I’m on good terms with and I snap her because we are friends. She gets bothered by it. When she’s mad, she won’t talk to me and she’ll just ignore me. I personally don’t understand why girls do this, it just makes it worse and I just worry so much more. It’s better to talk things out

51,"One of the things I value most is personal freedom, freedom to live your life as you see fit as long as your choices don't directly infringe on someone else's freedom to live theirs. I've always considered myself pretty liberal, at least in terms of social issues, but given the current state of our politics and culture I don't call myself liberal anymore, maybe I never was. 

It actually started a little while back when a lot of the anti bullying campaigns were circulating my high school maybe a decade ago or so. I didn't like the approach of trying to squash bullying by changing the bully and I thought (and still think) it's better to try and teach kids how to not be affected by bullies since that would at least equip them with skills that would help them throughout their life. My position also had to do with my belief that large scale change starts with yourself and that forcing change on other people is just a bad route to go. You can't get a teacher when you're an adult and being bullied by your boss, or some by someone at a bar or party, you have to deal with that yourself. I thought that our progressive efforts were going to make weak and fragile adults and I think I was right. 

That's just my opinion from what I see on social media because I don't actually have much contact with teenagers or young adults outside of the internet but it really does seem to be that way. I don't think we have a strong, independent, and competent generation coming up. I'm barely functioning either but I know it's because of my own failings at not appropriately adapting to my environment and not doing what needs to be done to improve myself. Sure, improvements need to be made in our society but I don't want to throw all of capitalism out the window.

Which brings me to my point and the title of this post. I'm definitely the minority on Reddit and I've finally accepted that I don't really like any of you or agree with most of what you guys say and upvote on a regular basis. That goes for the majority of what I see online and it comes back to my thoughts on bullying; I can't change the way you all think and so the only thing I can have power over is myself which is why I desperately want to leave this shit behind and never look back but I've been browsing this shit everyday for the better part of a decade so I always find my way back. It's like a disease that turns me into a zombie, I blackout and open Reddit and an hour passes before I even realize what happened.

59,"hey

just going to vent, i’m falling into a deep deep hole. 

so last week, i was finishing up my last week of a solo backpacking surf trip in asia. i had an amazing trip until then. it was super hot and beautiful. then i had what i’m pretty sure (awaiting on results since yesterday) was my first genital herpes outbreak. holy fuck, i’ve never experienced pain like that in my life. i was so uncomfortable. i couldn’t walk, think, or do anything normal without my head screaming in pain, and the worst thing was that i had to act like nothing was wrong- being in a hostel surrounded by strangers. it ruined my last week. no surfing no nothing. i couldn’t see a doctor either, it was a third world country and i just wanted to be home on my couch in comfort. i felt as if i couldn’t keep myself properly clean. fast forward a week and nothing had improved, but it was time for me to travel home thankfully. 45 hours later and i’m home, such a long journey :( finally got to the doctor yesterday and got swabbed.. but i’m 99% sure i’m positive. so i’m dealing with it as i go, and i’ve never been so devastated.

to make matters worse the guy i’m seeing sort of (to explain our relationship, over the past summer we fell in love, head over heals for each other.. but he had to go back to school for 8 months in sept. we were going to end things there but time passed and we missed each other so we saw one another over the holidays. we are together when we are together, and apart when apart. it had been okay that way. apart from missing each other all the time. so it had been 7 months into his schooling, and he was supposed to come home to me. move in with me, for this spring and summer again- in 1 month. on my first phone call with him since being home he ended things with me - saying it’s to hard and he’s doing europe this summer instead. i get it. i didn’t want to do distance in the first place, but i was so in love i didn’t care. i just wanted to be with him again. 

anyways he says he still loves me but it’s too hard. i am honestly okay i’m just having a heavy week. i still will have to disclose to him.. as he might’ve even been the one who gave me to fucking virus. 

i just feel alone. i feel sick- and i really thought that he was the one that even if i had disclosed with a positive result, that he would still want to be with me. now i’m just stunned. i don’t know how to go on with normal life and dating? i feel like this is the end of my sex life. 

i used to love casual sex. i usually always used protection (i know how stupid i was now. the few times i didn’t - drunken mistakes.)

so. just laying here on my couch, heartbroken and in a lot of pain ( my outbreak has been SEVERE ) and yeah. just wanting to vent.

63,"Little backstory about my life. I had friends throughout middle school and whatnot and that was great. I have a million hobbies that I love. I lost all my friends in middle school and struggled to find the right group in high school. Never stayed with anyone for very long so essentially I had no friends. The summer before senior year I somehow became super confident and happy. Like I had no friends but was totally fine with it. I had my family and my hobbies. Then senior year came and I met this wonderful girl like nobody else and we fell in love and spend every moment together for over a year.

Halfway through my college freshmen year (and her senior year in high school) we broke up. I could explain but it’s super long and complicated. Basically she became controlling and a jerk and couldn’t get over the fact that I didn’t fit in with her horrible family. And she also says she “fell out of love” which I don’t buy. It wasn’t random it’s because of all the problems her and her family have with me (for reasons I still cannot understand and they can’t explain). 

I cannot be okay. It’s been half a semester since the breakup and I’m so upset all the time. At first I missed her obviously but now that’s just numb. The problem isn’t that I want her back but my life. And I also can’t get her out of my head I’m thinking about her all the time. Not necessarily getting back together just like what’s she up to and how would I have done things differently and what would I tell her if we ran into each other. I have a group of friends and my hobbies. And these take my mind off but barely. They do not bring me happiness anymore. I can’t find it anywhere. I don’t even feel like I fit in at home anymore either. Like it’s as if I missed out on them for a year and am just now coming back. (Because I spend way too much time with my girlfriend over my family).

I don’t know how to get her out of my head and I can’t stop missing high school (with or without her) and I can’t just enjoy my hobbies all the time and get happiness out of hobbies or friends or even family. ",16Mar2019,2

65,"Two days ago I was sitting with my younger coworker and giving her advice about what to do after she graduates with her masters. She mentioned wanting to live abroad for a year and I of course light up and give her advice on how to make this possible. You see, I lived in Japan for a year and a half , one of the best and toughest periods of my life and then after getting my masters I moved to Amsterdam for a year and traveled Europe. It’s a cornerstone of who I am as a person now and my favorite thing to do is to help others realize they can do it to without needing a ton of money or going into debt. There are a lot of options so long as you are flexible. I worked for two years during my masters in the study abroad office, this kind of thing is my passion. 

But it wasn’t easy. I have always had debilitating social anxiety. For the longest time I struggled, I had dependency issues, it took years upon years to get to where I am today, a much more functional and independent person. People at work don’t even know I have anxiety. And of course, I’m comfortable now and have let my silly side show. They even laugh at my jokes which is a huge win. My anxiety comes out now only when I’m out in a large group of people I don’t know and expected to be social. Parties are not my thing. But one on ones I’ve gotten much better at. I flounder awkwardly for the most part but I’ve learned how to quell my anxiety, push it deep down to the bottom of me internally and just keep going forward. But I am hard on myself and still beat myself up for not being a better version of myself. I try and learn from my mistakes and each lesson has made me stronger. But I am not sure my self esteem had caught up with the rest of me. I knew I have gotten a lot better but I did not think of myself as someone that others really liked or gravitated towards. I think I’m seen as being a bit weird for the most part and I just figured my coworkers like me now because they have gotten used to me. 

But then we were talking and she said she was anxious about traveling and meeting new people and being alone in a foreign country with no support. I said of course, it’s never easy but it’s when things aren’t easy that you grow the most. And she said in reply “But you are a likeable person. People like you. People want to be around you. I have resting bitch face. I’m mean. No one wants to be around me”

I realize this was more a criticism of herself but I have never heard someone describe me as likable and realized that I had still been seeing myself as unremarkable, strange and also maybe even dramatic or complains to much (which I’m working on) and perhaps a person most people don’t want to be around. Which I guess is silly because my coworkers are cool and I’ve been making more of an effort to come out and talk with them recently which has paid off tremendously. ( it’s a learning curve - I’m getting there)

Anyway I just wanted to share and though this might be a good place to do it.  I’m turning 30 in a few months and it’s nice to stop and recognize how far I’ve come sometimes. ",16Mar2019,11

81,"TL;DR = attractive women are my biggest motivator, help pull me out of depression because I look forward to interacting with them and that stops me from having thoughts of going through with suicide. 


So essentially, I've always had mental health problems since I was young because of things that happened in childhood ( parents were shit basically ) and I've always had on and off depression, constant anxiety, panic attacks, ect.. I've been going to a therapist for the last year which has helped tremendously and I'm still improving more every time I go but I still struggle with things almost daily. I guess that's what happens when you wait until you're 19 to finally get help.

But here's something I find sort of interesting that I haven't told my therapist about ( should I? ) is that attractive women are the main thing that really keeps me going and motivates me to do better. I've been with my current girlfriend for more than 4 years and don't have any weird porn or masterbation problem because I know someone is going to say that in the comments so I'll just get that out of the way. I actually don't masturbate at all believe it or not, makes having sex feel sooo much better if you don't so I don't. 

So what do I mean by attractive women are the main thing that keeps me going? Well, let's put it like this and I'll try to give some examples. Let's say I'm going through some tough things and I'm going through a down phase in my depression cycle and I'm feeling low and don't want to go to class ( college ) or even get out of bed. The thing that will drive me out of bed and make me go to class is that I know I'll see my attractive classmates and if I don't go then I won't see them. No, I'm not a weirdo that just stares at people or anything btw lol. But yes, I know school is important and that I should go because I pay a lot to attend my college and everything else but the main reason I go is to see, talk to and be around my attractive school mates. 

Another example, let's say I'm really low and feeling like absolute shit and start getting suicidal thoughts, the thing that stops them all from going any further is that I know if I were to to kill myself, I wouldn't ever see any more attractive women and eliminate all chances of flirting, having sex, ect..and that's just too much of a price to pay and that keeps me grounded. I cannot kill myself because there's too many beautiful women out there and if I killed myself they'd all be gone. 

When I don't have the energy or will to actually shower, get dressed, not just stay in bed because of my depression what pulls me out is the fact that if I look like shit and don't take care of myself than I won't be attractive enough to flirt, get noticed and all of that by attractive women. You get where I'm going with this now? 

I'm not a creep or I don't cheat on my girlfriend and any of that. I just really fucking appreciate beautiful women. Does anyone else feel this way or experience anything like this? Is this "" bad ""? How would I/should I tell my therapist about this? Any feedback at all would be very appreciated. Thanks for taking your time and reading this.

84,"Everybody talks about Dan Schneider’s foot fetish and I agree that there is a lot of evidence to suggest that he is hiding foot fetish material in his tv shows. However, the foot fetish is the most common and most famous fetish. If Dan Schneider was putting all kinds of subtle fetish material in his tv shows, of course we would notice the foot fetish because it’s the most famous fetish that can be played off as innocent. Because I have a vast knowledge of fetishes and fetish culture, I decided to rewatch icarly to see if Dan Schneider was secretly hiding more fetish material in his show that went over the head of the average viewer. I finished the show and took some notes on possible fetish material that most people wouldn’t know about.

First, of course, was the frequent hoboerotic material I saw. Similar to the foot stuff, the “hobo” is always the subject of the joke. There is never a serious homeless character or a serious comment on poverty, because that would not be enjoyable to the homeless fetishist. One time, Carly found a homeless person in her bathtub which could be a fantasy to an older viewer. I would consider these innocent jokes if there was even one dramatic moment involving a homeless person, but there wasn’t so I am left believing that iCarly is ripe with hoboeroticism.

Next, I noticed a running gag where Sam would use a sock filled with butter as a weapon. This is clearly a reference to a BDSM punishment, where the dom will take a sock filled with butter and lightly hit the sub with it. I can understand why the average viewer, even an older one, would not notice this because It is rare in an already niche fetish culture. But anyone who has seen enough BDSM porn will eventually find the same butter sock technique that Sam uses. I will give Dan Schneider the benefit of the doubt here and assume that he only subconsciously got the butter sock idea from BDSM porn.

The next fetish is much more damning. I’d like to turn your attention to this clip:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Le1S2JTP2C4
Now, anyone who has even a cursory knowledge of fruit BDSM knows that eating a banana peel is a common punishment for a disobedient sub. Not only that, but he is eating the peel publicly, so possibly combining it with a humiliation fetish. The “crazy fruit dude” also looks suspiciously similar to Dan Schneider himself. Because there is so much to dissect, I will fire off quickly some possible fetish stuff in icarly:

Sam being mean and insulting - erotic verbal humiliation Spencer always setting things on fire - pyrophilia Carly not wanting to talk about “what the goat did” - beastiality Freddie loving technology - technosexual

And now some reaches, but still possible:

Lewbert - Humiliation and Mole Fetish Spencer eating disgusting foods - humiliation and BDSM

I may be more aware of fetish culture than most people, but my knowledge is still limited. If I could find all of this in my rewatch, then I'm sure someone with more niche tastes could find other fetish material. Now the big question, does Dan Schnieder himself have all of these fetishes? Or is it just a way to get older viewers to watch the show? That I don't know, but I hope that this starts a conversation.",16Mar2019,2

88,"I grew up as an Pentecostal American. Somewhere along the line, I started to see the holes in the logic of my religion. Meanwhile, I saw that science (and its cousins such as history, sociology, etc) has been building much better cases for its claims. Eventually, I lost my faith and became an admirer of science, and have been ever since. This first started happening around high school, and like all high schoolers, the discovery of some ""hidden truth"" made me believe that I had it all figured out.  


Fast-forward to now, and my habit of intellectual pursuits continues to this day. But in the process of learning more and more about the world, I inevitably came across some ideas that challenged my views yet again in ways I didn't really expect. A while back, I bought \[this book\]([https://www.amazon.com/World-Until-Yesterday-Traditional-Societies/dp/0143124404/ref=sr\_1\_1?keywords=the+world+before+yesterday&amp;qid=1552744318&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1](https://www.amazon.com/World-Until-Yesterday-Traditional-Societies/dp/0143124404/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+world+before+yesterday&amp;qid=1552744318&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1)). For those who don't care to read a synopsis, the book basically details the experiences of \[Jared Diamond\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared\_Diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Diamond)) and his time living among tribes in Papua New Guinea. Rarely do I say this about anything, but it flipped how I see the world upside down. More specifically, it put the world into a much broader historical context and made me realize that this value I ascribe to science and reason has played a much more limited role in humanity than I thought. I realized that I had taken for granted the fact that the only real reason I thought the way I did was not because I had ""seen the light,"" but because I was raised in a particular culture that fostered scientific thinking.

&amp;#x200B;

Given my negative past with Christianity, I was among the many who scoffed at the idea of religion and couldn't wait to see it go extinct. I thought it was basically just a vestigial organ that has long outlived its usefulness, and all I had to do was wait for the hero that is modern science to snuff it out entirely one day. But after I bought that book, I started diving deeper into learning about tribal societies and how they were different from modern societies. I found out many things, and one thing I learned is that the way they think about culture and religion is much different from our way of seeing it. We in the modern world have a much broader scope in which we see the world, so we often recognize that if we had just by chance been born in another part of the world, we would have an entirely different culture and an entirely different set of religious beliefs. To a small tribal society, they may not even have distinct concepts for religion or culture, because their religion and culture are simply their reality. It's just so interwoven into every aspect of their lives that it's all just a given. Nobody questions it, and it would seem most are content to be fed a prescribed, mythological answer when they ask ""where did we come from?"" To my modern, Western mind a few years ago, I would have had an almost visceral reaction to the thought that someone would reject the truth in exchange for a ""bullshit"" answer like ""the great spirit made us from clay."" But over time, I realized a few things. I realized is that no matter the time, place, size, or technological advancement, virtually every human society has had religion integrated into it in one way or another. Knowing this, I was forced to confront the idea that if religion were really as vestigial and useless as I thought, then why hadn't it been weeded out yet? You would think in a world where food and resources were scarce (most of human history), you wouldn't be investing too much time and energy into things like crafting totems and dancing in some religious ceremony, yet that's exactly what humans have always done. If it truly had no utility, then why hadn't those people ""wasting their time and energy"" been out-competed by a tribe who had learned to be more practical and industrious? The answer isn't quite obvious to a mind like mine that's been conditioned to the modern world, but all I know is that religion has always been, and even in our best efforts to eradicate it, it still hasn't gone away. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to give the wrong impression. I'm not a delusional hippie who thinks the Western world has nothing to offer. There's good and bad in every way of living, and everything in life comes with a trade-off. I just happen to think that the trade-off we've made in the modern world is peace of mind and a sense of purpose, and I think that's often under-estimated. The more I think about what it might be like to live a ""stone age"" kind of life, where you already have all the answers to life's mysteries and everybody around you is basically in agreement about what's real and what's valuable, the more I wonder what the value in the truth is. We all like to believe we want the truth, yet people lie to themselves on a daily basis anyway. Even in the modern world, \[in the face of undeniable evidence, the average person will still deny the truth as long as they don't want to believe it.\]([https://www.amazon.com/How-Know-What-Isnt-Fallibility/dp/0029117062/ref=sr\_1\_1?keywords=how+we+know+what+isn%27t+so&amp;qid=1552764612&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1](https://www.amazon.com/How-Know-What-Isnt-Fallibility/dp/0029117062/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=how+we+know+what+isn%27t+so&amp;qid=1552764612&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1)). Maybe the great spirit didn't literally mold us from clay, and maybe we don't literally communicate with our dead ancestors when we drink some kind of magic potion, but were we really that bad off believing that? We might have the literal truth in the modern world, and that might be enough to get us to the moon, but what good does it do us when people are constantly in a mire of uncertainty? What have we gained that's so important that it was worth all the depression, anxiety, and lack of purpose? What kind of world have we made for ourselves where we work our asses off to afford a smartphone and then use it in \[an empty attempt to search for why they're so unhappy?\]([https://www.youtube.com/results?search\_query=ted+talks+happiness](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ted+talks+happiness)). We've found the truth, but I'm not so sure we were ever meant to figure it out. Maybe there's a reason humans have lived under the certainty of religious belief for so long. \[Maybe Jack Nicholson was right.\]([https://www.youtube.com/results?search\_query=ted+talks+happiness](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ted+talks+happiness)).

Again, I want to reiterate that the value of science is reason is not lost on me. If I get sick and I have a choice between a medical doctor and a shaman medicine woman, I'm going to choose the medical doctor. But the greater the reward, the greater the trade-off. In a quest for knowledge, we had to let go of the certainty of our world, and with it went all the stability it afforded. Uncertainty causes anxiety, and I don't think we were meant to live with anxiety all the time. Uncertainty causes divisiveness, and I don't think a culture is meant to be divided. We've embraced chaos for better technology, and I don't think that's always a bad thing. I just feel that I'm at a point where I need to re-evaluate the modern world and wanted to share my thoughts. I have a lot to say about this topic and don't really want to write 50 pages about it, so I'll leave at this condensed version. Hopefully I've hit all the major points I wanted to make, and hopefully I got them across well enough. Thanks for the long read.

90,"One of the major tenets of modern elections is ballot privacy, in order to prevent retaliation, special treatment, and vote buying.  

However, given all of the efforts to compromise elections in recent years, could voluntary disclosure of voting ballots be another way to ensure the integrity of elections?  

If all of the ballots are logged into a site where people can see all of the self-disclosed ballots logged as well as their own, in addition to the blacked out names of the other voters for candidates, then it seems like the odds of election fraud would go down, because there would be independent verification by all the people who self-disclosed and checked their own recorded ballot.  

For the vote buying issue, the penalties for accepting or giving such payments could be significantly increased to address that.

Last night just after I  thought that finally I was getting accepted in a group of peers I had to  fuck it up royally because after a couple of beers I opened up about  work stories and of course I had to respond by telling one story of how I  got fired one time for having a laugh, problem is this new guy which  was the bf of one of the girls has just arrived and didn’t hear the  beginning of the story, he just heard me say “...and that’s why in unemployed” and before I even acknowledge his presence he fired back  with “so you are a parasite of society?” and I politely told him to fuck  off, which was my mistake.

He started  telling how finding a job is easy and that the beer I was drinking were  his because he pays taxes and also how his mom is disabled and she works  full time anyway and the others were getting behind him and laughed at  everything he said and I when I tried to explain people were just  awkwardly silent, until the friend the introduced me to the group  grabbed me by the arm and said “He just literally roasted you there’s  nothing you can do” and everyone started laughing at me like were some  fucking kindergarteners.

I just lost it  and told him every insult in the book and stormed off I grabbed the bus  and deleted every social connection I had with them.

And here I am, alone again.

This was the third time something like this happened in my life and I know I am the problem.

I dont know if this is a relatable problem or not, so I'll give some context.

I (F16) am currently in my first long-term relationship. Our one year anniversary is approaching and I'm starting to think a lot about my feelings for him. We've been through a lot of shit together and I have never felt as much for anyone as I do for him. However, I feel like something recently changed between us. We've been fighting quite a lot and he has some fundamental issues as to how to deal with people and being sensitive, because this is his first relationship. I also feel like I am too clingy and that it would be better for me if I took a step back by us taking a break from our relationship.

Now I want to know is this the natural progression of a relationship? Have I just fallen out of the initial madly-in-love-phase? I am really confused by my feelings and whether this is love or not.

But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.”

105,"I did my best this week.

I haven't been feeling OK for the last few weeks, but I've been doing my best to handle it, to be positive, to continue working, to connect to others and to be more open.

It's hard for me to open up about how I feel, and sometimes I don't know how to put into words to explain... how every day is a struggle. It's a struggle to continue and to keep going.

Sometimes I'm afraid to talk about it to other people, because I don't want them to look at me like I'm sick, to tell me that it might be good to see a psychiatrist, or that I'm just being emo. Actually I have seen a psychiatrist for a long period, and it did help me a lot, and that's why I'm here right now, struggling to live the best I can every day, but it's hard.

It's not that I'm hiding and trying to pretend that I'm okay. Sometimes when I try to explain what I'm going through... I feel unheard and misunderstood. I feel unseen. And that's painful. But I tell myself that... If I give up and isolate myself... And give up trying to connect to others... Then I will really be unseen and unheard and never understood. So, it's okay that sometimes my efforts don't quite hit the mark, that I get hurt by other people's comments and judgements---I'll get up, clean my wounds and try again.

So... I'm doing my best and I did my best this week. I still don't feel okay, in fact today I felt really bad. I started to have the shakes again, it happens when I'm really scared and I have these... Fear attacks, like a wave of anxiety that hits me really hard. Usually I can talk myself out of my anxieties, like... Calm myself down and recalibrate. But today it was too much, I had this wave of fear, and all I could do was curl up, hugging myself and shaking until it passed away.

Then... It was like... Gone. I went to see my friends, we had a good time, I felt good and part of a community, I laughed at their jokes and even threw in a few of my own. Then I went home, and felt like I'm doing OK, then suddenly it's back and I'm on the floor again shaking.

This rollercoaster... This is not new. I've gone through this before many times. So I know not to resist it... Or to pressure myself to be okay. I let myself cry and I try to be open to the fear and the pain and to ... Accept it somehow... to surrender to whatever it is trying to tell me.

There is a lot of smoke and mirrors to the messages it brings. In the beginning the messages are always negative, are always angry and hurt, with promises of ""setting things right"" and brandishing the ""truth"" to put myself on the moral high ground. But eventually this passes and I realise it is only bravado and big adrenaline talk to bolster myself to fight against the world, the outside.

Then I realise that I am already hurt and wounded. And I've been like this for a while, and... I don't need to fight, I've just got to be kind to myself, and to remember all the people I love and how their love has saved me, that they did the best they could to support me,  that I am grateful and appreciative of this love. And that there is a part of me that also loves me, and has loved me and protected me all this time, and that this love has saved me during the darkest moments in my life.

Eventually... The chaos inside me calms down. And this is the time that I can start to hear the real message, and what ... It wants to surface from deep inside me... The place where I have buried many things I wanted to forget, or that were too hard to solve and connect to my conscious storyline.

Yes, I've been abused by people I trusted. It has happened a few times, different people but always someone older or some kind of authority figure. I was afraid... and too afraid also to ask for help. I also felt ashamed. Eventually... I fought back and it would stop, but when it stopped they always begged me please don't tell anyone, and now they were scared. 

I thought I had processed it, that I had... Worked through it and it was over, that these pieces of trauma had died and gone to heaven. But it looks like... They were only buried in a shallow grave.

When I realised this was what it wanted to tell me, I stopped shaking and felt some kind of relief.... And I felt really tired. And I realised... Maybe I needed to put it into words, and I needed to tell it to other people. I've talked about it to my sisters, and now I'm here... Writing about it on reddit...

Yes I've processed it to some level, but I had continued to be ashamed of it. I also continued to quietly blame myself for it, to also put myself down and to tell myself that I should have been stronger, I should have stopped it faster, I should have fought back earlier. Consequently, I had been repeating to myself all these years that I needed to get stronger, I needed to be cleverer, I can't trust people so easily.

But today I realise that I was strong, that I did protect myself, that I did fight back and won. I was a victim yes, I was taken advantage of yes, I was hurt yes, but I also stood up in the end and said no and stop and don't fucking do this to me again, and they stopped. 
And maybe now I can let go of the shame and the self-reproach and the constant pushing myself to be stronger and harder.

Because I was strong. Because I am strong. Because I did the best that I could at that time and in those circumstances. And that I'm still doing my best. I've got many issues I know that, and every day I'm struggling and it's not easy, but I'm doing my best.

And I did my best this week.
And it was hard.
But now I feel... That I've got to the other side.
And I just want to tell other people and myself: don't give up. It's hard yes, it's a real struggle, and it's painful, yes.
Just do the best you can, and your best is the most you can do in the state you are in. Sometimes we are not in the state we imagine we should be, and we expect more energy out of ourselves than we actually have.

Or mindlessly accompanying someone to anywhere they want to go, and being called upon to do semi-mindless things for them. Eating when they provide food, and doing self care tasks when they say to, but not like dom commands.
