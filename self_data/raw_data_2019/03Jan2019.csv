0,"Before anyone starts calling me an over traditional sexist hipocrit prick yada yada yada...I want you all to know I AM AWARE HOW HIPOCRIT, SEXIST AND BAD this is, so I am seeking for help to change this.

MY PROBLEM IS, my inner self has a problem with girls that are not virgins, and I am aware this is only MY problem because someone's past shouldn't affect me in any shape or form, however it does. I want to know how to get past this. I know this is a antiquated and sexist mentality that everyone should abolish and not even care if someone is sexually active or not. I want to look past a girl's experience/past and just focus on the woman I am meeting. I just met a girl that is lovely, but with the key questions I have acquired throughout the years, I know she isn't a virgin and I don't want this to affect me and self sabotage a nice relationship because of my problem. How can I fix this? Has someone ever fixed this? 

(Many people I have talked say it comes with maturity, but I have had this problem for too long and I have accepted it is a problem for over 3 years, so clearly time ain't helping.)

So a bit of a background of myself, a 24 year old straight Male, is that I come from a pretty conservative culture. I have two really conservative religions in the form of my parents, my dad being a Muslim from a radical muslim country and my mom being a Catholic from a pretty conservative Catholic latin country. I was raised Catholic since I was kid. I have been inside the Catholic spectrum ever since, but had many faith issues in the past few years having an internal battle with it. 

When I was 7 years old my mom thought I was becoming too feminine and she decided to stop hugging me or basically being loving with me. Coming from a latin culture, this is something that affected me a lot because our culture is a very warm and loving one. When I was 9 my dad had to move out because he was working in another country and I lived with 9 women and only me as a the only boy. My dad came back once every two months so I lost my male influence in my life. Ever since then I locked myself in the room and by the age of 14/15 porn became a regular thing. When I was 14 my dad came back home, but had missed most of my formative years as a teenager and puberty. At this age my parents really thought I was gay, even mentioning it directly or questioning me if I had done anything with a male cousin, which clearly broke me even harder. Here I just went on a over usage of chat rooms to hit on any girl classmate or friend to get a girlfriend as soon as possible to prove my parents wrong. This desperation only brought rejection and by the time I graduated High School I had over 100 rejections and no success with a single woman. One time, I even tried to do something with my little sister, I kissed her and she is 8 years younger and I was acting super inappropriate while not putting in mind she had no concept of what this was. My desperation made me do horrible things. I felt horrible about it back then and still do, even apologizing again a few months back after my elder sister mentioned it just to break me. My younger sister ended up telling my parents and they were shocked and scared for me. This led them to think I might have done the same with a male cousin I used to sleepover with, which I didn't. When I was 16 after one of my classmates rejected me, my dad found me sobbing in my room and took me out for a ride, he wanted me to try some alcohol and just grow up a bit. I didn't enjoy it and we went on to ride around the city. We reached a place in which had some prostitutes and he asked me if I wanted one. With rejection in my head and hormones jumping up and down I for sure agreed and begged him to let me have sex with one of them. I felt a lot better back then with no sight of religion. Now, I resent him for this because I wish my first sexual experience was more emotional than paid sex in which he blamed me because he said I wanted it. I left my country to study in Asia when I was 18 and had my first sexual encounter since the prostitute months after arriving in that country. I was clearly innexperienced and out of the loop. Then I kind of dated some girls but never led to anything until a year after when I met a girl from another latin country. I remember when we started dating I quickly went in to ask her out of the blue ""are you a virgin?"" (Which she was) In which she clearly got offended because I wasn't and she was not happy of the question. In this time I was also judging my female friends who were sexualy active even though I had 2 sexual encounters before. When I thought about it, my female friends sharing their sexual encounters and this girl getting offended by my question, was the first time it hit me how hypocritical it is for me to want a virgin without me being one. After we ended up parting ways, I went through a ""crazy"" stage in which for a year I had more than 5 sexual encounters thinking I would never have a girlfriend again. Then I met my ex girlfriend, my only proper girlfriend. I remember how excited I was to meet her and keep on dating her. Then my roommate told me she (my ex) dated someone and I started questioning whether she was a virgin or not. This brought me a lot of problems, because she, being a local from the country I reside in, had dated someone from a Latin country which I wasn't too stoked about. Then I found out this ugly looking guy, not even took her virginity, but also raped her once before they broke up. I never blamed her for the rape and never made me feel disgusted, but by her having sex with him did destroy me throughout the relationship even though I had had 8 times more sexual partners than her. We dated for two years and I never saw her marriage material, because she had had sex with this ex bf of hers. After we broke up last year I have dated a couple of girls and now me being older and the girls too, it is getting harder to meet girls that aren't virgins. I dated this girl that was a virgin in which I came on to be her first, but she ended up being totally immature and felt like dating a 16 year old while I am 24. This trend has continued by meeting girls that are awesome, but not virgins and meeting girls that are virgins, but me not being attracted to them because of their immaturity. (I am not saying that there aren't girls that are virgins and mature, or girls that aren't virgins are necessarily more mature. However, of all the girls I have gone on dates lately, the ones I find the most attractive in all aspects happen to have had sexual encounters before.)

Sexual promiscuity is something that was always frowned upon in my family and besides my dad trying to lead the sex ed in my house, it was really sexist on how it was taught. Sure, my mom always wanted her kids to reach the ""Virgin til marriage"" ideal of religion, but the sexist mentality of it was that my sisters were going to lose more if they had sex. Men, weren't as bad to have sex, still bad, but no that bad. However, many times I was caught masturbating and watching porn and my mom was scared I had gotten addicted to it. This led her to warn me that if I am not careful I could get a disease or get a girl pregnant showing off a cousin as an example.

Now 24, I have had more than 10 sexual encounters in which only 2 or 3 were emotional ones. Clearly I broke every moral code of the Catholic church regarding promiscuity. I am a very romantic person always wanting a significant other and actually enduring the practices of making them feel special. It is clear I have a sexist mentality because there are many things I do and think that protect men, but condemn women. This is where my problem starts and why I am seeking from you for help. Catholics do say that we have to wait 'til marriage and Muslims do too. 

AGAIN, MY PROBLEM IS, my inner self has a problem with girls that are not virgins, and I am aware this is only MY problem because someone's past shouldn't affect me in any shape or form, however it does. I want to know how to get past this. I know this is a antiquated and sexist mentality that everyone should abolish and not even care if someone is sexually active or not. I want to look past a girl's experience/past and just focus on the woman I am meeting. How can I fix this? Has someone ever fixed this?

8,"I wanted to ask your opinion on my situation. First off I've removed, and have zero contact with my parents. They are toxic, narcissistic people. They aren't good to be around, they've tried to turn all my kids against me, and pump lies into their heads about me. To make me look as if I'm a bad parent. They've already turned my siblings against me. If I don't  talk to my mom my siblings won't talk to me . Iwork two jobs, a just graduated from college, and I have 5 kids (two that are not biologically mine), and a man of 11 years. I will be going back to school this year to get my nursing license. I don't think I'm doing so bad. Just trying to be financially stable. Recently, because of the no contact and my kids have no contact with their grandparents, they have called dcf two times with false accusations. They have my oldest 16 wrapped around their fingers. So he constantly sends them negative things about what's going on in the house hold to try and trigger dcf. Well, my parents also put in his head that he could move there. So he's just steadily pressing buttons with me and his dad. Finally after the second call to dcf. I told him he can just go live with them. If this is what you want go ahead. So he went. But now he's constantly in his sisters inbox trying to bleed her for information and trying to turn her against us from a distance. Im not sure what to do. I'm tired of walking on eggshells. They are all crazy. And trying to control at 30 years old. Should I take all social media away?? What should I do about the multiple calls to dcf for no reason?? How do I end the nonsense?? My parents are evil people.  Thanks an advance. ",03Jan2019,1
9,"10 years ago, my family decided to adopt a dog over Christmas. She is a Pekingese breed and very playful and full of energy (we also share the same birthday which is pretty neat.)

As an only child, my dog meant so much to me. After my mom and my dad divorced, it was just me and my mom and my dog. We moved away over the summer of my 8th-grade year and have lived in the same townhouse since then. My dog is my best friend and is everything to me. 

Excluding all expenses towards our dog, I mostly took care of her. I fed her, walked her three times a day, played with her, gave her baths, etc... I always had it in the back of my mind that one day I would lose my dog, I thought I had accepted that. 

Last week we went to the vet for a blood checkup. She seemed completely fine: no unusual vomiting, no change in appetite, no visible signs of disease/irregularity, no change in behaviour. She was as active and as happy as she always was. My mom received a call today from the vet while I was at school saying that my dog had hypercalcemia (high calcium level in system). 

You can look up the main causes of hypercalcemia, but now I'm not sure what to do. We don't know the leading cause of my dog's condition, it could be kidney failure, it could be lymphoma, Addison's, it could just be nothing. I thought I had more time. I thought I could spend another few years with my dog. I'm not ready to see her go so soon, she and my mom are all I have. We ran another diagnostic today and I won't find out the results until 2-4 days later. I pray to god that nothing serious will happen to her.",03Jan2019,1

11,"He legit has been on my Snapchat and FB for 3 years, I met him once. I never really talked to him ever, only a few times in general conversation about our lives and so forth, and I really didn’t write to him after I got with my boyfriend. He was just some random kid on my social media who I flirted with before my bf, so I kept my distance not that he was ever a concern.

But a year ago he started sending me random pictures of either his face, his job or just stupid shit like drinks and stuff. But never said anything. I guess he was just getting more into Snapchat? I either would just look at whatever he sent or I’d write something casual back. Eventually my boyfriend and I broke up (we were both on dating apps at this point and not talking). So I finally decided to have a real conversation with this guy and said something flirty on Snapchat to see what his deal was in which he reciprocated. But the conversations always went nowhere, dead end or left hanging. I even at one point just wanted to see if maybe he was shy and couldn’t talk to girls. So I gave him my number and his response was like “Oooh yeah?”. But instead of texting me, he would instead send a dumb picture of his face or Snapchat me again with “hey”. I gave up easily and just didn’t bother anymore. Some how I wondered if maybe he was cheating because at one point it said on FB he had a gf. No clue. It made no sense.

Eventually my boyfriend and I got back together and I forgot about this kid and still he would send me stupid pictures every so often or write “hi” and then wouldn’t say anything. He was just weird. I even wrote Happy New Year to him among several other people on Snapchat and he never responded. Today I got a random “Oh hey” and then a picture of him shirtless, which I completely ignored for obvious reasons. I go back on Snapchat 2 hours later and he blocked me, then I went on fb and looked up his name and he blocked me on that too. Took him 3 years haha. He’s legit been friends with me on FB and Snapchat longer than my own bf and it took him 3 years. Sorry but having a cute face doesn’t replace personality and (for lack of a better word) “game”. It was a surprise to me that’s for sure. Smh.

I have a few close friends but have recently not been receiving messages from them, so I've been spending my days couped up in a basement at my computer like my normal introverted self. I enjoy being able to just sit and not have to worry about how I come off to other people in person, but I just have been feeling weird about it lately. I have these random bursts of just feeling like my head is exploding with crazy thoughts, makes me want to collapse from all the action in my head. After the whole thing I just get these shivers of realizing that I would never be able to explain it to my close friends, thinking that there's no way that they would be able to understand what I was trying to say. It makes me just cold and sloshy, realizing that those who I talk to wouldn't want to listen or might be busy (when they probably aren't but I get all nervous...I digress). In the end the whole experience just makes me feel so incredibly alone in the world, like there's nobody out there who I could just talk to and enjoy their company and they would feel the same. Maybe it's my fault for not putting myself out there enough...I just don't know anymore. This has been happening for the past few months, and I don't know how to make it stop. Any suggestions are welcome

16,"I decided to quit football after playing 2 years of high school ball. Today, I just told my parents and the reasons on why I wanted to quit. They didn't understand and wanted me to play another sport if I quit football. I really don't feel like playing any sports at the moment and focus on other passions like: drawing and creating videos on YouTube.

One of the reasons of why I quit, was because I didn't really like my positions coach. He wouldn't let any of the sophomores receivers start on JV even though, we were stronger, faster, and taller. I also lost the passion for the game throughout the years. However, I can see why they were shocked and didn't understand why I quit. Ever since I was 9, I'd beg my parents to let me play pee wee or go to a football game.

17,"I am empty on nights like these where my soul is  in an entranced state. My brain thinks it’s been neglected. Maybe it has for quite some time. 

When I was a little girl my mum would cry and cry and cry and ask me why I never told her I loved her or gave her a hug or kiss on the cheek. 

I’d sit on top of the toilet in the bathroom and stare blankly at her before tears dripped down my face telling her I felt nothing. I felt absolutely nothing at all. I was empty. 

Years pass by and I fill the emptiness with people. I fall in love to feel not so empty and when that gets boring I seek falling out of love to feel pain. 

That explains my multitude of toxicity in which I sought out. A warped sense of comfort but comfort nonetheless.

18,"I love going to shows - I live for it actually. It's the closest thing to a spiritual feeling that I get. When I was a kid my mom would take me to free concerts with her and we'd have a blast (anyone else remember Cindy lauper at mixfest at the Boston common in the 90s?)

Now I can afford to pay to go to shows and I typically don't mind. What I do mind is Ticketmaster and their monopoly. I just found out about lady Gaga's residency at MGM in Vegas and I want to go. I looked up tickets and obviously the only place to buy is through the racket Ticketmaster. 

They have tickets and they're selling them for an insane amount of money even before you add their outrageous fees. They are ""reselling"" tickets. How the hell do you resell the thing you're in charge of selling in the first place? How is this ok?? 

This would be my platform if I ever got into politics.

19,"Right now I eat:

* Meat (pork, chicken, beef) grilled, roasted or fried and served plain.  Barbecue sauce is also fine.

* Eggs, cooked in pretty much any manner.

* Potatoes, cooked in pretty much any manner.

* Most types of white bread (French, Italian, sourdough, whatever).

* Pasta.  I used to just eat it with butter or alfredo sauce, but lately I've tried some more sauces at restaurants that I've ended up liking, like carbonara, bolognese and amatriciana.

* Basic cheeses; usually mozz on pizza, pecorino romano on pasta, and cheddar for most other things, but I've also had and liked Swiss, gouda, and provolone.

* Green beans cooked or raw carrots.

* Apples. 

* Some nuts; I like cashews and peanuts especially, although I try not to eat much of them since I'm losing weight and they're very calorie-dense.

* Some sweet things; mainly relatively plain chocolate stuff and, like, sugar cookies.

So, as the title says, I'm looking to branch out and looking for recommendations of things to try that aren't *too* out there (baby steps).  I'd especially love to find things that I can order at Chinese and Mexican restaurants without feeling like a child, but I've spent so much time not paying attention to the food that I don't even really know what options are.

23,"me info: have adhd, always had focus issues, prepared for assessment by setting up for success, struggled, assess delayed, 2 months of effort fell apart after, got meds recently and can focus when I choose, feel chared from last attempt, want nothing, feel nothing.

I have high ambitions but zero motivation, I've created plans, threw myself in deep water, put myself in most fertile environments to enable personal growth. I've fixed a lot over the years but now, with the final and mmm let important step, I can't do anything. I had two weeks off, first ten days I slept. I was probs awake for 4 hours total each day, thought that if I cut myself from media and electronics I'll sooner or later get bored and start working in what i want to work. it didn't work. Any attempt at focus would make my guts uneasy and proceed to have internal freak out, my mind would not work no matter what, completely blank.

Truth be told I enjoy nothing no more. Friends, family, gf, i care about no one. Everyone annoys me, i enjoy people more out of my innate curiosity and idealism than sincerity, like how I care for media characters, just less. I only put myself out into the social situations to work on my social skills and develop my empathy, in the end my favourite role in a party is to sit back and overlook the setting, making sure there's no trouble and try and make sure everyone has their voice and enjoys themselves, like it was work, because I don't.  I have no interests or hobbies. I had, but my mother was an aristocrat; born and grown to a wealthy family then lost it all. it's a toxic mindset to carry, for everything she stands for I'm the antithesis of. I only regret for not being more rebellious as a teen, she worked hard, she carried a lot of weight, but I just took her emotional discharge and finicky behaviour, didn't want to fall in the stereotype,  thought I can be bigger than that. logically i coped, but even though I could reason through and thought nothing she said affected me, I noticed that her words left lasting impact. Words of a foolish woman I care naught for, yet when I hear her walk my heart still skips a beat. Even my libido is super low. Truth be told reason why I care about being alive is the same why I care about a game of civilization, i want to see  progress and change, experience it and maybe one day even drive it. That's my end goal, become  historically influential figure, like Naruto becomes next hokage, unlike Naruto I have no will or drive. Surrounded by people yet I feel alone... no,  I don't even have myself, I truly have no one and nothing to care for. I don't know what to do.

I have bipolar disorder which makes it difficult to mantain my sanity in this fucking theocratic society that is unfolding for us.   


I also have a cracked skull that has caused sever motor function issues and a slew of learning disabilities. I have bouts of amnesia these days as well.

Can't have kids either due to fertility problems. I'm just a dick waiting to the end.

32,"When we first met she had a boyfriend. She's that typical perfect girl that every guy around puts on a pedestal. I don't know if it matters but I've never been in an intimate relationship with a girl.

We met last year at the beginning of high school and, obviously as a hormone-raging teenager I started feeling attraction towards her. But I told myself that it's never going to happen and that's where I immediately drew the line.

A year passes and in the meantime she breaks up with her boyfriend. During this year we became distant, we didn't talk as much and we just apart. BUT the other day day she gives me *the look*. We start to talk and laugh and joke together again. So naturally, I start to feel attraction.

At first I was like this is never going to happen, it's all in my head etc etc. Following week and week after that she started dropping these little hints that indicated that she in fact liked me back, like touching me, teasing me, giving me that same weird-but-very-hot look. I was aware of it, I'm not socially inept, but I kept telling myself NO. 

We were at a New Year's Eve party and my mentality was: fuck it, if something's going to happen, it's happening tonight. Everything's going well, she gives me the same signs she gave before, and my mind I was thinking: yeah, this might actually happen.

I was kinda the DJ, I was responsible for the music and all that. Anyways, we were dancing, but I didn't like the music so I went to change it and she went somewhere to do something. After a couple of minutes she comes back screaming to her bff saying how she just got herself a new boyfriend.

I have been rejected before, but it never hurt so bad. And I wasn't even rejected, I never asked her out, but I feel like shit. I've been working nonstop for the last 2-3 days and in my mind all I'm thinking is ""Fuck, what have I done to myself?"". ",03Jan2019,1

35,She might get kicked out of college because her grades were so low sophomore year the first semester and she has an appeal hearing in a few days to determine if she is dismissed from the college or let back in. If the hearing goes bad what do I say to her? I’m so anxious because I know if it doesn’t go well and she gets kicked out she’s going to be completely broken. Emotionally I don’t know if I can see her like that. I don’t want her to leave school. What can I say to her if it goes bad to comfort her? ,03Jan2019,1
39,"I don't even know what I'm doing wrong... never in my life, not once, had I a friend who truly cared about me. Those who I thought were the right people betrayed me once they had the choice, only contact me when they need something and never truly were interested in me, they only cared about the things they want. Always demanding but never giving. If I say no, it's as if I've forsaken them. If they're alone, they have me, otherwise I'm easily replaceable.

Quit a job a year ago simply because it was toxic and I was working 60 hours a week while taking a full course load. From then I did odd jobs to make ends meet while my parents helped with what they could. I have always felt guilty for using their money. 

Today though I got a job at a Fortune 500 company and I’m very excited!! Things are looking up and prayers have been answered in ways I never thought!!

I don’t want to brag. I’m just excited that all the hard work I’ve done over the last five years really paid off. ",03Jan2019,1

42,"Here’s a brief and inconclusive list of the bad shit that happened to me over the past year or so:
- I was bullied out of a job by a girl I used to be good friends with at work 
- what’s more, she bullied me by making consistent bullying reports about my apparently abusive behaviour towards her at work, which she was unable to substantiate and resulted in an inconclusive outcome
(The above happened over an 8 month time frame)

- my step mum was hospitalised in an induced coma for pneumonia
- my father died of bowel cancer
- my 5Y old dog died in a tragic accident that I feel responsible for not preventing 
- my new workplace is evidently toxic and is rotting away at me as a human being
- having to move house means I am stuck in two leases so I have barely any money. All my friends and family are two hours drive away and I miss them like crazy all the time 

I spent a large portion of my alone time last year trying to be healthy. I quite smoking so much weed, took up the gym, and prioritised self care. I like this life style but I can’t say it’s changed me as a person. 

For NYE I decided to hang out in a small group of my closest drug-friendly friends and, well, do some drugs. Like the good old days that I have since labelled as toxic and unhealthy. 

We drank alcohol and smoked weed (the staples for us) and decided to experiment with ecstasy and MDMA. One friend had a test kit so we could check what we were taking, and everything came up looking good so we went ahead and took it. We stayed at home, watched rave videos/music and stretched out in the lounge room, and milled about chatting to each other. 

The kind of high the MDMA and pills gave me let me experience the happiness I was capable of feeling 5-10 years ago (I’m 28 now). I didn’t even realise how walled off and bitter I’ve become until I felt that level of happiness. It made me realise how I’ve become very selfish, I’ve been a shitty girlfriend and an awful employee (made worse by how shitty my workplace has become). 

I have always been highly anxious and emotional, and have had my fair share of depressive episodes. But I hadn’t realised that I was depressed around the clock and wasn’t really experiencing happiness anymore at all. I had convinced myself that if I’m not suicidal at the moment then I’m not depressed, but I didn’t realise that I wasn’t my normal self. 

I definitely hit a point of being party-level high and off the planet. I had several emotional breakdowns and talked through it with my mates, and ended up crying happily because I could actually FEEL something again. I didn’t even realise I wasn’t feeling emotions anymore until that hit. Then I had a moment of being my carefree, happy self that I used to be.

I’d really like to experience it all again, but from what I understand it’s best to wait a few months to allow your brain to level out again. In the few days since NYE I’ve recovered from the lack of sleep and mild dehydration, and had minimal ill effects. I’ve felt more calm and at peace than I’ve done all last year. I don’t need to be in a ‘good’ mood right now to be having a good day, and bad things have been just breezing by and not bothering me. 

TL;DR, I took a bunch of drugs on NYE in what I consider to be a safe way and it felt awesome and reminded me how to be myself again. ",03Jan2019,1
43,"I only feel this way because I am about to be 26 and I still have friendship problems I've had since middle school. I though it was just me carrying a huge chip on my shoulder, but many people my age have also complained about women who are age 20+ still behaving as if they are in MS/HS. Many people generalize and put all the blame women who don't have female friends without thinking that people have different experiences.

I remember going to a dance studio nearly 3 years ago. It was all good at first until I started moving up (won't post the whole story).Two of the women didn't like me. They would smile in my face, but block me on all of their social media accounts. I also felt like I didn't fit in because the instructors would choose favorites and socialize with them. Many things also happened.

After that whole experience with the dance studio, my insecurities increased. I feel like I'm not good enough for anybody. I turn 26 in 20 days &amp; I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I 'll be 30 years old &amp; still alone while everybody is set with their friends because people usually start their families in their 30s.

My mother and godmother would tell me that some of the bullies/females were just jealous, but I didn't listen. It wasn't until I did a self-evaluation and started to read blogs centered around jealous people and what they do.

Guys aren't off the hook either. I remember at one point I disliked guys because they were horrible to me because of my looks. As for dating, I'm zig-zagged on it. Since I keep hearing horror stories about unfaithful men (I've never been in a relationship &amp; I've never been cheated on), I would rather be choosey with guys to avoid that mess.

If it was ever possible, I would rather go back in time to change the way I behaved growing up so I would have had a lot of friends &amp; I wasn't an easy target for bullies &amp; haters. Many people like to talk about how the ""nerds"" and ""unpopular"" people coming out on top, but nobody talks about how some of them are still insecure because of how they were treated. Nobody brings up how some of the ""nerds"" and misfits lose their ""friends"" and associates from high school because they become successful. Even as adults, they can still get hated on without provocation.

44,"You might think differently or I might be wrong but it seems to me that in life there is no objective truth, answer, value or virtue. There is no external truth that can be relied upon. We do something because we choose to, not because there is some objective truth that guides us. The way we choose is based on our personal assumptions and illusions that we are willing to form and sustain. We bear the suffering of living and we move forward despite obstacles because we choose to. Not because it is objectively right or virtuous. 

From another perspective, life is a type of game or simulation. Life should be lived according to values we choose to believe. We chose them not because they’re objectively true but because we just chose them. There is no external guidelines or truth that can tell us what to choose. 

We choose because that is our defining function. Our ability to choose despite obstacles seems to differentiate us and make us the best species in terms of survival.",03Jan2019,1
45,"Life is draining. Your relationships, the dinner conversation with your family. When you've read, seen, experienced as much but you physically can't share your side of the story. When you open your mouth and try to speak, try to enunciate the first syllable but the sound don't come out. I've had to live with this. It's draining. I don't know what to do. I want to disappear. I wish I'd never existed.

My tongue hurts from trying to make out sound. Once it bled, and so often my jaws clenched and tightened it would still hurt until the next day. I've gotten better a few times, almost to the point of recovery. I still can, if I try my breathing exercises. It's just fucking tiring I have to live with this but others have more real things to worry about. 4 year olds can speak just fine. They can say what they want. I'm almost 24, and I can't.

I constantly want to die because I see others, real and fictional, that I envy the lives and bodies of. What do I do.

47,"I’ve struggled with mental illness for about 7 years. I’m a young man with no real support network, just my counsellor who costs around half a days work. I’ve been referred to different services in the past, all of which claim there’s another service who can better help me. I feel like I’m just being bounced around as no-one wants to deal with me.

I just got off the phone with an NHS service who I was referred to around three months ago by my GP. They’re going to get back to me in a week to decide if they can help me.

I can feel myself dropping again. The start of a new year and I’m back to waiting on a service to see if they’ll accept or reject me. This cycle is draining me, and I don’t know how much more I can take of it.

I understand that these things take time and I am grateful for even having the NHS, I just want to make that clear.

50,"And I always have been for the whole 24+ years of my life. I actually don’t even know if sensitive is the best word for it. Maybe incredibly empathetic? I don’t know, but it’s always gotten on my nerves. The two best examples I can give you are my sensitivity to movies/music and to inanimate objects. And, yes, you’re reading that last part correctly. 

My sensitivity to movies and music is about as descriptive as it sounds. I will cry at some point during every movie or TV show that I watch if it’s not strictly funny, action, scary. If it’s a sad or happy move though, you can bet to look over and see me boo-hooing like a baby. There are movies that I can’t even watch because I know I’ll cry my eyes out (*ex: The Fox and the Hound*). It drives me absolutely crazy. Music also does this to me. If it’s a beautifully written song or the voice hits just right, I’m probably crying. Again, there are some songs that I can’t even listen to because of it. My late grandpa told my mom once who later passed it onto me that, “You don’t need to worry about crying, you need to start worrying when you stop crying. That means something’s not right.” So I’ve tried to stick with that. 

The inanimate objects one is where it gets tricky and incredibly annoying and might even be a borderline mental issue. Thankfully, this has gotten better with age, but it’s still there. I can’t properly describe this, but it’s basically that I’ve felt bad for random things that maybe didn’t get chosen or used as often. A prime example of this is when I was younger, I had the cool box of 64 crayons. There were colors that I just didn’t use that often in school, and since I genuinely felt sorry for these crayons, I would bring them home and use them all on their own pieces of paper. I just had this little sketch pad of browns, oranges, and that awful red-purple color - all because I felt sorry for these crayons!! I would also rotate all of my stuffed animals as to which one got to sleep in my bed with me so none of them felt left out. Just last year on Valentine’s Day, I bought my mom a little stuffed dog strictly because it was the last one on the shelf and I wanted to make sure someone wanted it. My entire life has been this way. I feel empathetic for non-living, inanimate objects, knowing full well that they don’t have feelings. It’s the worst.

52,"So a few hours ago my grandma passed away but the weird thing is I don't feel sad or angry or anything. I feel nothing.

I wasn't that close to her but she was still family so am I just in shock? I really don't know and am helping my dad get through this.

What I'm asking is, why? Why do I feel nothing? Is there something wrong with me?",03Jan2019,1
53,"It’s really frustrating because I know there’s no recourse as I can’t prove it was in my bag. It makes me feel like I live in a dictatorship where certain political speech is not allowed, and not the US.

All I want is to hide and never be found, I often switch off my internet connection, my phone, it's like I don't even want to exist anymore.  I have the wish to run away in the world where no one knows me, I don't have many friends here and my family it's not really a healthy thing for me. My life sucks, I get bored, I don't have the passion anymore, I don't recognize myself, I feel very sad or I feel nothing.  ",03Jan2019,1
55,"Just kept Instagram for my landscape photography and Facebook for contacts (my relatives are faraway, and i follow nice meme and science pages. So everything is friendly).
I don't know what happened to twitter, it's like dropping an extra exhausting toxic friend. Everybody is hypersensitive (if that is the word) overreacting, fake news, misinformation, too much negativity. Guess it took a long time before i shut it down because it became my online newspaper. 
Snapchat ... well i made an account, and never opened it again. And i am not a party person, and never had the sense to document every minute of my life and make wacky poses to make up for my lousy personality
Reddit is a very friendly place, i opened this account two years ago and then never came back because i was too busy studying in univ.

56,"Hi guys, hope whoever is reading this is doing well.

Im a 25 yr old man who recently graduated from med school. Over the years i lost interest in this field. After graduation i applied for post doc postions but no one wanted me. My relatives have clinics which i went to be medical assistant for about a week, but found it too much pressure and stress so i took leave lieing that i had to study for the boards. During that time i tried pursing something that always interested me which is IT. I studied for Comptia A+, got the certificate and applied for tech jobs which never replied. So i lost interest in that as well. I am slowly running out of money but did other jobs such as teaching, UPS for couple of months. But in the end i realize i really hate interacting with people it, i am pretty sure its severe social anxiety  which has progressed and gotten worse over the years. Upon this realization i dont know what to do. All jobs require social interaction etc and i just dont want to deal with this anymore. I considered masters, phd, army; but dont really want to study or put in the years. I have a wife and dog overseas and want to spend rest of life with them but ill need work visa etc which is too much of a hassle.

So now im stuck, i feel like ill be jumping from part time job to part time job just to live off pay check to pay check..... I just feel numb to everything now and dont want to do anything, but to survive i try to make some money. I cant say im depressed cause my sleep etc is normal, i play video games and do enjoy things but not to as a high degree as when i was younger. Maybe because everything is so expensive and the thought of spending money is out of the question.. 

Really dont know how long this will last for, its already been like this for a really long time..

If anyone out there is feeling this too then youre not alone.. anyone else who got out of this feel free to share.

Thanks, have a nice day.",03Jan2019,1

58,"Dear Reddit,


Today I woke up with a painful stiff neck. Went to a clinic to have physical exam for school. Needed to have an X-ray for the tests. As I was getting ready to get blasted with x-ray I remembered that my last one was 4 mos ago. 



The thought of being exposed to radiation scared the sh*t out of me.  Doesn’t it take at least 6 mos. before I can have another x-ray? I was starting to panic, trying to tell the radiologist that I might pass on the x-ray but she already went outside and told me to stay still and take a deep breath. 



At this point it was either be blasted with radiation and get cancer or panic and bolt out the door. I chose cancer and keep my dignity. Thankfully, I was just overthinking things. After the X-ray, I talked to her. Radiologist said it was fine. The amount of radiation wasn’t going to harm me. It was a relief. Today was a great day —until she said I have mild scoliosis. It’s just the 3rd day of the year and I got a stiff neck and a deformed spine in a day. Thanks 2019. I wonder what’s in store for me next.",03Jan2019,1
59,"I have always been the outcast type.  I’m a Tom boy who rides horses, likes video games and comic books.  I was raised with three brothers and have always been tough like them.  

I have especially struggled to have friendships with girls.  I can count on one hand the number of long term girl friendships I have had.  I don’t bond with women well and if I do forge a relationship, they don’t last.  It’s usually because I struggle to communicate when they tell me about their problems especially with their boyfriends.  Typically I just can’t tell them it’s the boyfriend’s fault like they want to hear.  Or that I can’t connect with them because I’m in a committed relationship where we use reason instead of letting our emotions get the best of us.  We’ve been together for 7 years and we have a life plan that doesn’t include sleeping around, dating other people or drinking excessively which seems to be the only things people my age do.

I have plenty of guy friends and an amazing fiancé who I’ll be marrying in 4 months but it’s so different than having a good girl friend.

I’m hurt because I don’t have a best girlfriend to be my maid of honor and I feel like I’ll never have a good girl friend.  It feels like I’m socially broken when it comes to interacting with women.  The wedding has really shined a light on how lonely I am and I just needed to say it.",03Jan2019,1
60,"I'm amazed at how many comments/posts I read on here about one half of a relationship coming home from work and ""expecting dinner on the table"". This entire concept seems so ludicrous to me, I'm guessing it's largely because I've never lived with a partner/in that dynamic but it just screams entitlement to me, like, where do people get this idea from that their partner is so many steps ahead they've thought to cook you dinner before you even realise you're hungry, let alone made it home yet.

Just a passing thought...",03Jan2019,1
61,(I'm 16 male) my mom said she was leaving for something and told me to wash the dishes while she was gone. I noticed a whole bunch of new knives in the kitchen and I went up to them just wondering how sharp they were. Immediately feeling the sharpness grazing the palm of my hand I had an urge. I can't do it on my stomach this time it's too noticible. I pulled down my waistband and grazed the top of my leg. I watched as the line slowly showed itself and turned red. Just one more just a bit deeper. I pushed slightly harder this time it showed itself faster. I couldn't stop myself again. I kept saying one more now I've got 6 cuts each one deeper then the last. I can't tell anyone. No one can fucking know. If my ex finds out she will be devastated. She will blame her fucking self. Fucking kill me lord I can't control myself. ,03Jan2019,1
62,"My depression makes me feel like people never ever value me or like me and they hate me.
I feel really really worhtless, i dont know how to be smart...

I try hard to make people laugh so they like me. I want to have friends. But i feel like im very passive aggressive and say mean things to them. Because i want them feel the same way i do...
So selfish i know. 

But what makes someone empty headed loser? A mindless loser? Narrow minded? Absent minded? Moronic? Stupid? Foolish? Dumb? How do i be a man? Do i have to be serious about everything? Or never serious? 

I feel like the worlds most piece of shit person. I feel so low and feel like others never ever value me and feel like they see me as inferior and naive and brainless guy with no personality.

I feel inane, ludicrous, daft, bonehead, witless, nonsensical.. shallow, useless, boring, dumb, dull, bland...

And i fap a lot. And i feel like i have to stop looking for approval of others. Might fix most things but there are a lot of things going on my head about whats wrong with me.

And always compare my self to the losers of movies. I find most annoying characters better than me.. i dont know how to have a personality, 

Most fictional characters are more interesting than me. I wanna be cool like indiana jones or batman or ironman or even hugh jackmans wolverine...

But all im rightnow is some weak, beta male, narrow minded, simple minded, boring, shallow, dull, worthless, meaningless, pointless, mean, doughbag... a guy who everyone thinks is invisible, a guy with no personality, a guy with no brain, a guy who no one values and no one cares about.. a guy who cant make friends or keep a conversation going for 5 minutes......

70,"I got an internship at a recording studio in Israel on jan 3 last year (I live in America). On my way there I spent a few days in Oslo, Munich, and Warsaw (Planned layovers so they were actually cheaper than a direct flight, also my transatlantic flight was fully refunded because they forgot to load water on the plane and we couldn't flush the toilet.

 After two and a half months at the internship they fired the person training me, and gave me his job, two months after that the owner of the company starts getting a lot of work abroad, so he puts me in the head administrative position in the studio with full management and engineering responsibilities, as well as the ability to pick up freelance live sound gigs. During this time I am taking my days off to travel the region and get to see greece and egypt, as well as all over israel. When my internship program formally ends I start working at a hostel on top of my 50 hours a week so I don't have to pay rent and can save all my money. Work 60-90 hours a week with my cost of living being around $5 USD/day ( I can cook at the studio and hostel so I don't have to go out to eat) for three months, buy a flight to Berlin, a friend from the hostel knew someone with a room I could rent under market value for a month or two. Get there and it is one of the nicest apartments I have ever seen, 12 foot ceilings with crown molding, 19th centrury church across the street, and in a very central location. I could go on forever about how beautiful this apartment was. An old friend who I hadn't seen much in the last few years while he was at uni meets me in Berlin and stays with me in the place for a month. We go to a concert in Amsterdam, with only 12 hours between our arrival bus and our departure bus, so we slept in a Park and just wandered the streets. While we are getting coffee in the morning he is telling me how he is planning on doing a bike-packing trip throughout Japan, after spending a few weeks with his cousin in Hanoi. He has a $10k+ bike and was worried about shipping it internationally. So I jokingly tell him to fly someone from LA and put the bike in their checked bag. He looks it up and it is actually $300 cheaper and airline baggage handlers are at least a little more trustworthy than international shipping routes. I guess you can see where this is going, I book a flight back to Los Angeles with a day in Iceland and a day in SF on my way back (I've always wanted to so Iceland, and my sister lived in SF). Get back to what I call home for the first time in 10 months and start packing my bags to leave again, it was very surreal, as I hadn't done any traveling of this level, save my first trip to israel, without my family before. Land in Hanoi, and I had been used to western europe, Tel Aviv and Los Angeles prices, so getting to Hanoi were 45 minute taxi rides are $6, and a full meal for 4 people is maybe $20, we are living like kings. Vietnamese tinder was insane, I left with about 90 matches after 20 days. I meet this girl on like day three and we hit it off really well, she is a tour guide so she knows the city better than anyone else. By the end of the trip we are basically inseparable. I've been out of Vietnam for a few months now and her and I talk every day still.

Anyway I get back to the states super sick because the air quality in Hanoi is horrible so it's a slow start for me to get moving again. My plan was to find some more audio work, but it's not lining up, so I've just been living at my Dad's place, doing the final post production on the album I have been writing all year, since mid November. 

Honestly I don't really care if anyone reads this, I just wanted to get it out there, because looking back I don't think last year could have gone any better, and I'm confident that I can do it again this year.",03Jan2019,1
71,"Kind of just wanted to see everyone else’s thoughts 

(This is going to be long, TL;DR at bottom)

I’m a teenager, and it might be notable that I’m 2 months off from getting my permit 

I haven’t always hated it or really realized it, but the last few months/year I’ve really grown to hate the suburbs 

For me it’s just so boring, nearly every day I’m stuck doing nothing at home unless I go to a party or hang out with my friends, part from that there’s just about nothing to do. I can’t drive anywhere, can’t really go to any concerts, festivals, or much of anything. 

I pretty often go to the movies, bowling, or go out to eat but it just isn’t enough. Plus you get tired of the same few things, and especially the same fast food chains, I’d love to try some random Turkish food truck over chick fil a any day. 

I jump at any opportunity I can get to go to the city, or even my local town center which is very urban. and it’s the only time I really feel good in a way, even if it’s just walking around. Especially after a vacation I took to Europe last summer, I can’t get over how great it would be if I could just be in Amsterdam or London right now, shopping or sight seeing. 

I would die to be able to wake up and walk 5 minutes to a library or cafe, or maybe just jog or go sightseeing 

This is more of a rant now, but I wanna see people and architecture and shit. And it’s not just the suburbs though, there’s places I would happily live in my suburbs. But it’s where I live specifically, far away disconnected house where you must drive everywhere. There might be enough to do here, but not without a drivers license and no public  transportation, and I don’t have the money to waste on Uber. 

(Also if you know of a more appropriate sub I can post this on let me know)
Wondering what all you’re thoughts are on this 

TL;DR: Suburbs are boring, never seems like there’s enough to do, I want to walk around in a city or go to a concert or club, or just eat somewhere new, I hate the whole slow, boring vibe the suburbs give me ",03Jan2019,1
72,"

A little about me is I am very level headed and I don’t get scared very easily. I don’t work myself up or exaggerate anything cuz I know if you let it get in your head you lose control. I am sightly under weight for my height and age (M 22). I have had no prior heart conditions that I know of either.

Last night I decided to smoke a small bowl as I have done numerous times in the past. I hadn’t smoked for about 2 weeks so my tolerance was rather low so I only took a few hits. 

About 45 mins later my heart was pounding out of my chest and for once I couldn’t get it under control. My breathing was a little off too I noticed and for about an hour I was trying to calm my heart and by controlling my breathing. 

I was just sitting on my couch when all of the sudden I had a sense of dread just wash over me. I had been checking my pulse regularly to make sure I was fine but once this sense of dread washed over me my throat feel warm and soft almost. I tried to feel for my pulse but couldn’t find it. My heart went from beating really hard and fast to barely anything at all. It continued to beat slow and soft for about 45 mins. I got up and walked around several times in that 45 mins and I felt slightly better. I ate a piece of pizza and drank some sweet tea but my heart just wouldn’t pick up. I got up one last time and walked over to my tea that was on the kitchen counter and took a few sips. I had been standing for about 5 mins when my blood ran ice cold and my vision turned completely black. I managed to stumble around for about 10 secs before I collapsed and my roommate had to catch me. 

According to my roommate I feinted and he caught me had to lay me on my back. I don’t remember that but I remember waking up a few seconds later and forcing myself to my feet. I couldn’t see anything but black for about a minute or two after I woke back up. I never blacked out or anything again but 15 hours have passed and my body and mind feel different. I don’t feel like me and I swear that I felt my heart stop right before I collapsed. 

I don’t even know why I’m posting this but I just feel different. Maybe for comfort? My heart feels weak and my mind feels slow. My body doesn’t feel normal either. Did I just feint from smoking too much? Was it actually something wrong with my heart? Did I just feint or did I die for a brief moment and come back some how? ",03Jan2019,1
73,"Throwaway acct 

For background: I’m 23 and do relatively well for myself for someone my age, though my life has been far from easy. I have had anxiety and depression my whole life and have also experience heavy trauma in my past. Everyone seems to use how my life seems to be now to disregard my feelings and problems. I am also introverted and am a great listener. I like to listen more than I talk. I would describe myself as fairly quiet  Others would describe me the same way, I’m sure. 

If I talk to my mom about my private problems somehow everyone in my family knows days later. So I don’t tell her anything but good news anymore.

My two best friends from home are busy with their own lives. They always tell me how they knew I’d be the one to succeed the most among the 3 of us. We were always so close but now, they don’t text me back unless it’s to make plans to see them.l every few months. I got them christmas presents this year and when I went home to give it to them I got nothing back. Okay....


I have another friend in the city i’m in now. She will talk to me for hours and hours about her endless boy problems. Always the same shit. I always listen intently and give her advice or just an ear to vent to. If I talk about my boyfriend or things I want to vent about I get ignored while she texts other people. Or even more frustrating will change the subject to what she wants to talk about. Alright, that’s fine....


If I talk to my boyfriend it turns into a conversation about his problems and he does admittedly have it worse (at this moment in time) but sometimes I am also struggling. I have dealt with way worse things than he has ever dealt with in the past but I don’t like to compare hardships like that. I never bring up my past (unless it’s to tell him a lesson I learned, or good advice that I took) when he’s telling me his problems. But whatever...

I finally got a therapist to help me deal with anxiety from past trauma and depression. Many of the things I want to talk about aren’t always trauma based, but anything else I bring up that isn’t trauma related gets dismissed as just “daily hardships” that will pass because everyone has a difficult job/daily life. 

Who am I supposed to talk to about anything? Why am I not allowed to have problems or stress or things that make me cry? I’m so confused and really hurt. ",03Jan2019,1
74,"Recently I had a pregnancy scare. I am by no means ready for a child. Fortunately, my period came and all is well. However, it left me thinking; what if I was pregnant? How would that change my current life?

I wouldn’t settle for my miserable job. I wouldn’t want to come home from work stressed out and have my child experience that. 

I wouldn’t keep a few of the toxic friends I do have. I don’t want their negativity to rub off on me. 

I wouldn’t go straight to alcohol at the first sign of emotional distress. Nor would I do any drugs to fill the void. 

I wouldn’t partake in reckless, impulsive, destructive behaviors like spending sprees, risky sex, self harm. That behavior is unacceptable for a parent. 

Why did I ever do those things in the first place? 
I’m young. I’m still trying to figure things out. I’m still trying to master my emotions. 

Now before I consider doing any of the above, I think to myself, “What if I had a kid? Would I still do that?” The answer is always no. So I don’t. ",03Jan2019,1
75,"I don't know what to do. I've cried most of the day, on and off. I'm somewhere in-between being numb, accepting, and being in denial all at once. Somewhere in the back of my mind I knew this was going to happen, but I wasn't ready for it. 

I was with my boyfriend/fiance for eight years. I'm 25 (almost 26) now, and he was my first everything. Literally. We've been through a lot: ups and downs, mini breakups, deaths in our families, etc. He was my best friend. He knows me better than I do.

Today he told me that he wasn't happy anymore, and he hadn't been happy in a while. Looking back now I see some of the signs, even though he insisted he was okay when I asked. He would get angry with me over little things. Annoyed when I worried about stuff (even though he knows I have anxiety). He recently started drinking alcohol a lot more and I thought it was because the stress of his job. Today he told me it was because it's the only way he could be happy around me. And that hurt. 

We decided to break up. I want him to be happy, and if I don't make him happy, he needs to find someone who does make him happy. 

I don't know what to do. I haven't felt this much grief since I lost my grandpa. I don't want to tell my mom because she's going through medical problems with her heart right now and she doesn't need that stress. She's also dealing with my clinically psychotic younger sister and that's a lot for her to handle. I don't have many friends to talk to. I have a few, but I don't want to pester them. 

The breakup isn't the only stressor. We JUST bought a house together last May or so. Neither of us can afford the payments on our own, and we don't know of anyone who would be willing to be a roommate and split the payment with one of us so the other can go somewhere else. I don't know anything about selling a house. I don't even know if we can sell it. 

I'm in a weird state right now. Like I don't want to commit suicide, but I also don't want to be here, if that makes any sense. I just want to be...somewhere else. Someone else. ",03Jan2019,1
76,"Somehow I am semi-successful to exaggerate. Although I always was the odd child on the playground. People tend to observe me because I'm quiet and different. As they do they also miscategorize me very often. Or maybe I don't know myself well enough? In the end I don't say anything about it or with a too quiet voice. 

Now it got to a point where I have a colleague who is a psychologist with an interest for different cultures. I hate it when he asks me personal questions and compares me to others but I don't say anything against it. We have to spend at least a half year together on a project...

This is one example of how I don't intervene in things. Another one might be not being smart about setting my holidays to get money. I would not use it instead of planning. Don't know why. 

Even in school I remember a day when I ran many meters to the metro station. The metro waited for me but 10 m before I stopped. People even told me to try it. I sat down.

How furious? She had twisted her ankle terribly and wanted to walk around Wal-mart furious. Throw our past in my face and end the relationship, furious.

But who gives a shit about that now, it's all done. She made her choice, I accepted. There is no fixing what is broken beyond disrepair in her eyes.

But clean slate.

Clean. Slate.

That's what you said, and it still resonates in my head like a note that just won't stop it's sustained hold at the end of a song. I thought about what that really meant, clean slate. The fact I am literally at my own ground zero, a place where I have the choice to be myself again or blindly sell myself to love. Where I can take control of my health, my finances, my mind, my sanity, myself for once. And you knew that, like a silent fly on the wall that has been there the whole time but impossible to notice.

83,"My emotions are all over the place, they are sporadic. My mood goes high to low to back to high. I go from being a rationally sane human being to an irrational over thinker. I know, I’m getting help with that... 

The thing that pisses me the fuck off is when I explain to people the reasoning behind my behaviors and people get pissed off when I had told them how I was from the very beginning. They chose not to listen and decided to act upon their own behaviors without taking a step back to rationalize the relationship/situation. I’m a very self-aware individual, my behaviors stem from the trauma I’ve endured in my lifetime. I’ve worked so hard over the years to “fix” myself, to completely understand why I do the things I do. I’m good by myself, but once you add another human being to the mix I can’t stop spiraling. And it’s not me!!! Okay I lied it is me AND the combination of another person. 

I’ve been living my life “my” way for so long it’s difficult to adjust to another consistent person or partner in my life. 

We all have issues. We all are fucked. That’s not a secret. I spiral when I start to feel overwhelmed. When that person I’m seeing hasn’t fully “fixed” himself, and his/her baggage overflows onto me. And shit, I have my own baggage.

I have realized I don’t like to be pushed or rushed into things. I will dip my feet in and then dive head first if I’m ready. If I’m not ready, I’ll run the other way and spiral in my own anxiety. 

Maybe I need to be even more direct than I already am.

I was facing so much of my own crises that I couldn’t take time and just miss my dad.

For a long time I thought I was over my dad’s death (as “over it” as one can be) until I met my current husband. They’re alike in a lot of ways and I can tell my dad would’ve liked him. My dad liked most people, he was very easygoing.

I have two kids now with another on the way and one of them gets incredibly carsick. But I know my dad would’ve made day trips up here and back home. He drove so much for work (sometimes 8 hours one way and then he’d drive back) that I know he would make the trip, especially to see his grandchildren. I know he would take so many pictures of them.

I dream about him a lot, still. The other night I dreamt we were walking around Walmart and he told me to get whatever I wanted for the new baby and he would buy it. I was so grateful because money is tight and I wanted some high tech swing. And two nights ago he was there to hold my newborn daughter when I dreamt I gave birth to her in the bathroom.

I miss my dad so much it’s a constant ache. I know he was an alcoholic but he was always patient and kind and *funny.* People always talk about how funny he was but he always kept it tame around us kids so I never got to experience that. He was hardworking and took pride in everything my brother or I did. He would work 12 hours and still be there to watch me run a half mile race in track and still be excited when I got last place.

Anyway I miss him a lot and I hope I see him again some day.

85,"So I had the last 4 years quite rough from a bipolar disorder and it’s consequences. Couldn’t find any graphic designer job and ended up being alone. But I still worked my ass and focused on my art. I recently finished an animation music video. Then I sent my new portfolio to some animation agencies across the world and I just received an answer from London! They are interested by my work!

Of course that’s still not really tangible and might not result in work, but I’m so happy!

Wanted to share, thanks!",03Jan2019,1
86,"I read about a psilocybin trip recently where Extreme Suffering was showed to the guy then an Ego-Death (a state of nothingness) and his conclusions were:

""To be alive is to embrace it all, and not put any meaning on any of it.""

""Without meaning there is no story to an event, occurrence, or memory. Our ego-mind assigns meaning based on past experiences, filters, distortions, and lies. Meaning comes through a story—to what we attach to an event. We assign meaning to everything, but it means nothing.""

""We needlessly suffer based on attached meaning. The false reality we have created from thousands of stories that have no meaning.""

This idea of Meaning as the root of Suffering sounds very powerful and I cannot stop thinking about it. When I take examples in my life it seems to correlate: the meaning I gave to a relationship, a person that now is not by my side because of the impermanence of this reality but maybe this meaning I construct (love) is what created the attachement therefore the suffering once lost (because the Universe is that way, everything changes).

What the hell do you think?

87,"Growing up I was extremely awkward. Especially with women. This is due to the fact that I hadnt really ever had one on one talks with my father because he was working a lot and the fact that I sheltered myself in my room just playing video games all damn day. 

Now, around the time I was in middle school I thought that it was time I got myself a relationship, and I had a major crush on my best friend. 

I confessed my love to her and she rejected it.

And God I wish that was the end of this story, because, you see, little greasy haired nerdy me was not that good at taking rejection. I thought, ""well maybe I could get her to like me just like [generic main character] in [generic tv show]!!""

So I just hoped that she would eventually fall for me.

But I was an impatient little bastard. I eventually tried to get her to love me by sending her Shakespearean style love letters via email telling her that I loved her and she was beautiful and how we should be together and I hate myself looking back on it. (I think at one point I compared her to a gazelle like goddam). I sent a *lot* of them, too.

She was a trooper through all this because she never got mad at me for it. Saw it as it was, just a nerdy kid being awkward.

But eventually it got so bad that I remember our mutual friends drafting a fake *restraining order* against me.

That should have been my first sign.

I could never really pick up on social cues. I kept doing this even when she got a boyfriend, thinking to myself that life was just some big romantic comedy and that I would emerge victorious with the girl.

This lasted for four years and three boyfriends. I was *that* awkward for fucks sake.

The straw that broke the camels back was when I asked her to homecoming. She obviously said no, but I still wasnt good at taking rejection. To protect myself I told her I asked her out on a dare.

This changed my whole life.

She stopped talking to me because she was so pissed off (and rightfully so). Hell, I dont even know why she talked to me in the first place.

There was no turning back at this point. She cut all ties. I was forced to *finally* deal with rejection like a man and I started really dwelling on what I had done for the past few years, and I started to become self aware. I hated myself. Like absolutely hated myself.

I wanted to be as far away from who I was that I made a ton of lifestyle changes. Started practicing basic higene, put down the games and picked up hobbies that would get me more social, just very basic stuff that changed my life drastically.

Its been a good few years later now, and I am a changed man. I have had three good relationships (one of them even semi serious), and I am nowhere close to who I used to be.

And while I hate what I had done, I wouldnt change any of it. If it weren't for the mistakes I made as a greasy greasy teenager, I wouldnt be as good with people as I am now. I wouldnt have changed my life. I honestly think I would have progressed into being a fully fledged incel.

So, if you take anything from this, be it this. No matter how much you fuck up you can always learn and better yourself.

89,"2018 was honestly one of my hardest years to date. I worked two horrible jobs, one that was ruthless sales job that made me work 6 days a week, 9/10 hour days. The other one was a privately owned cafe where the owner was a compulsive liar and caused a lot of stress/drama for me an all my colleagues. I got diagnosed with Pure OCD, after 20 years of living with what I just thought was generalised anxiety disorder, I had figured out why I thought the way I did. I broke up with my boyfriend twice as a result of my OCD - (we are back together and have figured out how to cope when I have OCD flair ups). My best friend ghosted me. I had another realisation about another best friend and cut them off myself. I was dealing with the aftermath of an abusive relationship from 2017 yet I 

• started university again
• finished the year on good grades 
• quit smoking 
• gave up party drugs 
• started eating healthy and learnt about nutrition 
• created a strong bond between my boyfriend and I and maintained a healthy relationship 
• started learning and expanded my general knowledge 
• saved enough money to buy a car 

It was honestly a really hard year for me and I pretty much feel jaded towards humans after the two falling outs I had with my friends. I feel like I did all these positive things yet I still hated last year because I was stressed and lonely. 

I hope 2019 is better but I’m worried that even with all my efforts it will be a flop. To be fair things have calmed down for myself but I guess I’m worried that I’ll feel shit again

91,"You might think differently or I might be wrong but it seems to me that in life there is no objective truth, answer, value or virtue. There is no external truth that can be relied upon. We do something because we choose to, not because there is some objective truth that guides us. The way we choose is based on our personal assumptions and illusions that we are willing to form and sustain. We bear the suffering of living and we move forward despite obstacles because we choose to. Not because it is objectively right or virtuous. 

From another perspective, life is a type of game or simulation. Life should be lived according to values we choose to believe. We chose them not because they’re objectively true but because we just chose them. There is no external guidelines or truth that can tell us what to choose. 

We choose because that is our defining function. Our ability to choose despite obstacles seems to differentiate us and make us the best species in terms of survival.",03Jan2019,1

93,"I recently finished my first semester of Film Studies with Film production (in England). And I fucking hate it.  It's killed any passion or motivation I ever had. I used to finish a movie and be able to discuss it for hours or even days with people. Now I just leave them and it's like I never watched it. I'm more lost now than when I finished College. I just don't know what I'm doing with life anymore. I have no aspirations or goals, and Uni just isn't helping me.   
  
I just want to be able to have the freedom to live my life, I don't need a career. I just need money so I can go out and do whatever the fuck I want. Even if that means working dead end jobs and living in apartments. 
  
I've never enjoyed school, it's not for me. I just don't have the motivation to sit down and do essays. The one part of my course that I'm actually doing good in, graded me on a movie pitch. All the other ones I've been graded on my essays, which have been awful.  
  
I've always hated the idea that my success is measured by how well I can write an essay or dissertation or whatever. Don't get me started on the just brain dead studying. Just constantly reading books and articles that you *have* to read. I'm more than happy to read books on films and writing etc. but I enjoy doing it in my own time. Being forced to read them just takes away any joy I have of reading it.  
  
I applied for Uni with so much excitement. Now I wake up with anxiety knowing I have an essay due in 2 weeks and an essay thats overdue that I just can't bring myself to doing because I literally cannot find any motivation at all. It doesn't help that I just know nothing about these subjects because when it comes to studying them, I can't bring myself to be interested in them.  
  
Then comes the issue of not knowing what I want to do in life at all, which makes finding motivation so hard. I want to just drop out, take a year off to decide. But my mum hates the idea, she wants me to stick the year out then decide if I want to drop it and go on to something else. She believes another Uni is more likely to accept me if I do that, rather than if I drop out after one semester.  
  
I just don't know what I want anymore, I genuinely can't picture a future for myself. I don't want to die, I want to live and be around all my friends and family. But I just can't even see myself a year from now, and it's genuinely scary to me.  
  
Sorry, I went into this with the intentions of asking for opinions, but just ended up ranting.

He’s alwaysssss tired, complains he gets headaches, claims he never has money but is always working. He does seem really calm and sort of numb to everything I say. I don’t know what this means or if I’m just jumping to conclusions. I don’t know if he’s smoking weed (but he never smells), or edibles, or even other drugs, I just have no clue. Do you guys have any advice on how to go about this? Or maybe even what he’s doing haha? ",03Jan2019,1
