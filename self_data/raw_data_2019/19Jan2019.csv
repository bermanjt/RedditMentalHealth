4,"I'm not even sure how I look anymore becuase it seems like me on photos, me in the mirror and me in real life are all different people. Not even going to mention that I dissolve to even more fuckers depending on which side you're observing me from. I'm looking at myself in the mirror thinking I'm the shit, the embodiment of million dollars. Then I look at photos of myself and think - wow, WHO the fuck is that? My shoulders are uneven, my neck is tilted to one side, my head's turned and my jaw's tucked to another side, my ears are uneven, one side of my upper lip is climbing the everest and the other is on the bottom of the mariana trench, eyes look someone snatched them from two different pairs, one cheek is huge and bloated, all over the place, the other is little and depressed, my eyebrows are so f ed up it's not even funny. What kind of sick fuck designed this? I'm keeping my posture in check, sleep on my back, chew equally on either side, fuck I gotta do more? Can't even relax sitting next to someone because I start thinking of keeping all the shit in check. Tilt slightly to one side and I start to fucking shapeshift on the spot. I really can't tell if I'm attractive AT ALL at times. All seems to be great until I see a photo of myself.  I consider myself pretty happy, I'm confident and I know my worth. But this shit is what keeps me up at night",19Jan2019,1
5,"I moved away from where my best friend lived. I visited a few times in the past couple years, and he seemed the same person. Now, this visit, he’s a huge douchebag. He insulted me, bragged about everything he possibly could, called me a loser, so on and so forth. He even made fun of me for having depression. I just needed to vent, I feel really depressed and somewhat suicidal right now.",19Jan2019,1
6,"Seeing an almost post (they quickly deleted it) about somebody who got a wrong number and pretended to be the person the caller asked for got me thinking about my own experiences.

Back before mobile phones, they had all these prerecorded numbers you could call.  They would tell you your horoscope, tell the time or even read you a story.

Sometimes I would be so lonely that I would call for the time, just to hear a voice talking to me.  I miss that.  I need that right now.

Another time I had moved to a new place and got a phone but the number must have belonged to a Jessica James because I would often get calls asking for her.  I wonder what happened to her that she seemingly never told anybody her new contact info.  How close were these people that they didn't know what she was up to?  Did they wonder why they didn't see her around anymore?  Were they all out of town?  Had she been abducted of just checked out of life?

Nobody ever much called me and I was glad to get her calls (pathetic, I know).  Sometimes  the other person and I would say a few words if they'd called before.

Yet another time I got a wrong number where I guess the guy didn't recognize that I wasn't who he wanted to talk to.  He just started talking and I didn't mind.  He was a ""Dry-Land"" cotton farmer which I thought was interesting!  Man was he pissed off  when he realized that he'd dialed a wrong number.


Okay, that's the end of my sad story.  Now that I have a fancy glowing supercomputer in my pocket the only off calls I get are robots trying to fleece me out of money that I don't have anyway.

7,"Hi!
I’ve just returned from the Rhône-Alpes region in France after a couple of months visiting my sister. I really had a great time learning and experiencing the culture. Ever since I’ve been back home I’ve been very indifferent and honestly cannot readjust to my old life. I have family and friends here but it just doesn’t feel the same at all anymore. I honestly don’t feel like I have a future here. I met a woman out there whom I fell in love with and we talked about marriage and starting a family together. We’ve also been in constant communication since I departed despite the time difference. 
 
The issue is that I’m currently unemployed and looking for a job so I could save up and return soon. I’m just a bit frustrated at not having any investments or savings to facilitate this move. 
Despite all of these obstacles in the way, I’m fairly confident and positive that I will be reunited with her soon and we can get married. ",19Jan2019,1
8,"I am overcome by the urge to cry at the most random times. Like right now, I’m just working on some homework. I started zoning out and when I snapped back I just felt like crying. I can’t think of any reason tho.

It got real quiet.  I could tell the guy was debating it.  Just kept eating my food, eventually gave him a three second eye contact gaze, then went back to eating my food.

They ended up leaving without saying or doing anything.",19Jan2019,1

13,"I'm 15, and few months ago I left (or got kicked out of) a group of friends I cared a great deal about, and now I'm thinking about them again.

Me and three others formed a little group maybe a year ago, over video games and other shit like that. Until an old friend who I didn't get along with anymore came along. (He told me to fuck off because he wanted some other friends.) He invites all three of them to his house daily, from what I can gather they mostly smoked weed and drank alcohol.

Later I find out they talked about me behind my back. When I confronted them about it, the world's shittest apology followed:

""I'm sorry you found out about it.""

After that they gave up all pretences and just started saying shit to my face.

Friend 1: ""I'm bringing some beer for the house party tomorrow.""

Me: ""why don't I get to go?""

Friends 2: ""because nobody likes you.""

Me: ""fuck off.""

Friend 3: ""no you fuck off he's right you should be grateful we hang out with you at all.""

This made me quite sad. I wanted someone to talk to...

Friend 1: ""you can talk to me I won't tell anyone and I understand how you feel.""

Me: ""sometimes I feel like I don't have any real friends anymore."" ( I feel like an idiot in hindsight but at the time it was a bit more subtle.)

Friend 1: ""here is a list of all the reasons you don't get along with other people, and how you can improve yourself."" ( need I say that he also told everyone everything I said to him?)

After a while, i couldn't take it anymore and there was quite a lot of shouting. They told me they never liked me and that I didn't deserve to be with them. And so I left. Later I found out Friend 2 actually defended me so they kicked him out too. He was a bit of a cunt, but a good person.

I've moved on, and I found that cutting my ties with them helped me make new friends. But I'll never get attached to any of my friends ever again. Sometimes, at night, I'll lie in bed and this will pop into my head. I feel like a friend group is always doomed to this from the start. Everyone needs someone to bully, and maybe I'm too fragile.

You could just jump and everything will end, the nightmare of the human mind, the sadness compressed in every perception, the consant reminder of a future full of suffering. It would be quick, just a little jump...

17,"been thinking a lot lately. realized that I have extremely strong passion for the arts- singing, dancing, photography, any form of art brings me extreme happiness and I wish I could pursue them all. 

I go to one of the top science/engineering schools in the world. I've always been good in the math &amp; sciences I guess. But, of course, here is where I'm surrounded by this scholars with thousands of internships, researchers, and what not. It's always a competition, and sometimes, tbh, it gets so toxic. 

Since I've come to this country, i've watched my mom work every day and night and my dad sit at home. I mean he at least helps take my mom from and to work, but thats about it. I know my mom is sad. I know she wishes she could have a better life. And for that I wanna be something big, so that I can live happily and forget about my rough childhood (grew up alone; had problems being social, a lot of arguments and drama at home, etc.) and mostly help my mom. I want her to relax. I want to make sure she lives in a beautiful house and has no financial problems to worry about.  Also, my parents want me to be something big in sciences/tech fields.

18,"Feels like everywhere I turn its bad luck. I grew up in the church and was taught things like 'be kind, honest, compassionate, etc...' growing up I've always tried follow these lessons but life just isn't rainbows and sunshine. Doing the right thing puts you at a disadvantage and being the nice guy means people will walk all over you. For the longest time despite being dealt a bad hand in life I tried to go through everything with a smile. That soon ended. A person can only endure so much. I was a very negative, angry, hopeless person for many years. Recently tried to move out of that hopelessness and become a more positive person but its the same result as always: unbelievably bad luck. I try to have a positive happy day , I smile in the face of misfortune and troubles and yet it just doesn't stop. Its like God or the devil or whoever is watching is saying ""You think I'm gonna let you be happy?? Nope...""  Its biblical it really is. At least Job got to enjoy being wealthy and having a nice loving family for a few years. 

&amp;#x200B;

If the devil is doing this then why the hell doesn't God stop him?? If he truly loves his children why is there so much suffering and evil in the world. I know many people will mention that I'm over-exaggerating and the fact that I have access to food,water, shelter, etc... means I'm doing better than a large portion of the world's population... And I know that. But that's the funny part; I have it bad and yet there are STILL people who have it worse. Some people get to be born the kid of Kushner or Trump and live a great life and some people get to be born in a developing African country starving for most of their lives... What kind of just and loving God allows this??? 

&amp;#x200B;

Its like every time I try to be positive and better myself God has to come and shit in my mouth. What is hope? Just a cruel joke? Clawing your way through to try to get to the light at the end of the tunnel only to have more rocks fall in? I'm not asking for a good hand, I'm just asking for not to have bad luck at every turn that way I actually have a decent shot at playing a good game. I feel like at this point in my life the only reason I still believe in God is because some supernatural force must be screwing with me...

20,"My partner is sick. Fever and cough. Seems like a flu. I have immune system issues and can become sick very easily. I made them soup and they refused to eat it because they said they were nauseous, but then ate a bunch of junk food while I was at work. They call me into the room every 30 minutes to “feel their forehead” even though I’ve expressed I’d rather not be around them because I can become sick super easy. I do it anyway, because I don’t want to be mean. They yelled for me and I ran into the bathroom and they asked me to rub their back while they vomited. I did. Four times. I just say there and rubbed their back while they dry heaved. It almost made me vomit. I spent yesterday cleaning and spraying everything down with disinfectant, washing clothes and bedding, etc. I slept on the couch, because I don’t want to get sick. I asked them super nicely to please stay in the room. (it’s a master with an attached bathroom and I said I’ll bring them anything they need) They came out to the living room and woke me up several times throughout the night to “feel their forehead”. I did and told them to please stay in the room. Woke up and realized they had “cleaned” the kitchen. Aka put clean dishes away and things WITHOUT WASHING THEIR HANDS FIRST. I feel like I’m going insane. I explained why it upset me, strapped on my gloves and respiratory mask, and cleaned and disinfected everything again. They’re refusing to wash their hands, refusing to cover their mouth when they cough, etc. because they “don’t feel good”. They won’t even take medicine. I’m going insane.

24,"The title of this post says it all. I don't know why I'm even writing this but I needed to vent somewhere. My boyfriend (26/m) and I were together for a little over 2 years and we didn't plan to get pregnant. He wasn't ready, I didn't know if I was but I didn't feel strong enough without him. I was a child who's father did not want to be a father and wasn't ready and he wasn't a part of my life until I was three. It weighed heavily on my decision. Could I provide enough love alone? Would my child hurt as much as I do because of an absent father? It was the most difficult decision I have ever made in my life, but I knew I could get through it because he promised to stay with me and support me through it.

Unfortunately things haven't worked out as promised. He hasn't been with me at all and I've been all alone. I don't understand how another person could do this to someone they claim to love. He's not even sure if he wants to stay together anymore. It's the worst feeling of betrayal. I believed he was my best friend and it breaks my heart even more that I still wish we were together.

25,"My mom and I were leaving the store headed back home. At the gas station near our house, we saw an ambulance and a fire truck pull in. The cashier is our church member, so we decided to pull into the parking lot just to see if something had happened to him since we believed he was working tonight. 

The cashier was fine, but he was doing chest compressions on a man who was sprawled out on his back by the gas pump. 

The paramedics went to attend to the man; from where I was in the car, I couldn’t see all that was happening. But I did see the two men who were with the incapacitated man throw up their hands and develop facial expressions of great sadness: I think the paramedics had told them he had died.

I can see that many people are passionate about it, and I wish that I had the ability to be one of them, but I just can't manage it, even though I guess I agree with the basic message.

In my defense, I have a hard time fitting in with any crowd, regardless of their message or subculture. I always felt awkward at concerts or sporting events, for example.

Unsurprisingly, I am from a mostly white neighborhood and I have a similar reaction to black activism. I don't deny the injustices minorities have faced, but it feels so much safer to just say ""all lives matter.""

I guess the reason public displays like this make me anxious is that it creates a strong ""us versus them"" atmosphere, and when their message is articulated in such vague terms, I feel like I am at great risk of accidentally being seen as ""them"" rather than ""us.""

I wish I could just give them whatever it is they want, so that they would no longer need to have marches like this. Both for selfish and empathetic reasons. I wish there was a magic button that made society permanently good so that we didn't had to think or argue about it any further.",19Jan2019,1
28,"Hey everyone! I'm reaching out to request if anyone is in a similar situation to me or has been in my situation. To give some background, I feel like I have done everything correctly that I've wanted to do in life:

* Graduated high school
* Graduated from Community College with transfer credit
* Graduated from a University with 0 debt (no help from financial aid, I personally paid it off in bulk from saving all throughout my high school years)
* I graduated with the opposite of debt-- net worth ($12,000+)
* I have a toxic relationship with money-- i.e. I'm too cheap to buy anything for myself. The majority of my wardrobe is from over 5 years ago (the same 5 - 6 shirts, and 3 pairs of pants)
* I got a great paying job directly out of school (graduated on a Saturday, started work that next Monday)
* The job is awesome and has great benefits, culture, people, etc.
* I've been with my girlfriend since we were freshmen in high school
* I've recently moved out with my girlfriend and we share our own place with a cat and a puppy
* In general, we're a happy couple that rarely fight or have issues

When put on paper, it sounds as if my life is basically super chill; however, I cannot help but feel so damn bored. Bored, unhappy, annoyed, disappointed with myself, etc. Throughout my teen years, I tried every entrepreneurial venture I could find: YouTube, Twitch Streaming, forums, websites, etc.

I became exactly what I didn't want to do-- a 9 to 5 worker. Although I make a great income and my job itself is awesome, I still go to work every morning feeling like I'm wasting my time. Obviously, I'm too conservative to quit-- and I'm not one for change. I've been doing the exact same schedule for almost 2 months now, and I just feel as if I'm lost just allowing life to control me instead of me controlling life.

I went in and out of homeschooling throughout all of my school and I did OK in school but didn't really do anything while homeschooled. I graduated from high school not really feeling like I did anything to deserve it.

I did a semester of college and it didn't go well at all. I just procrastinated so much and didn't do anything other than classes. My anxiety towards my procrastination got so bad that I plain didn't show up to my finals.

I don't really do anything all day except for play video games and eat and drink and sleep. My parents don't make me do anything. I don't have any motivation to start doing anything.

I want to actually start trying to learn how to actually function as a human being, but I honestly have no idea how. Every time I get the opportunity to learn how to do something like drive or cook or anything useful I just get anxiety and chicken out. If I try to learn something by myself I end up getting stuck on something but refuse to ask for help because I feel embarrassed every time I try to make myself better. It feels like how I am is what is expected of me and I feel anxiety when I try to step outside of that. 

I'm sorry for typing this much, I just have had all these fears and thoughts in my head for so long and I needed to get them out. I'm not expecting anyone to respond to this, but thank you if you did read this. It's late so I definitely am not expecting much. 

I honestly have no idea what to do with my future. I feel like I'm just incapable of teaching myself to be a better and capable person.

34,"Hi all. I just wanted to share some personal growth I experienced today because I’m really really proud. 

I suffer from social anxiety, general anxiety, depression, and have some symptoms of trauma from sexual abuse. I have been mentally unwell since I was 14 (I’m 20 now.) I have been waiting and waiting for the day I am suddenly better and my mental illness is cured. 

Today my psychiatrist said that my recovery is long term. He said I would be this way for the next 6 years if not the rest of my life. I needed to learn how to cope and deal with the horrible feelings and manage the illnesses I have. He actually compared my mental health to diabetes: it’s not going away, and it absolutely sucks that you have it, but with proper management you can still live a fulfilling life. 

You’d think this information would just depress me further, but I feel great about it. Maybe I just needed someone to tell me to work with my mental illnesses instead of against them. I realized that if I’m gonna be sick for maybe the rest of my entire life.. why complain? Why spend so much time asking “why did this happen to me?” When I could be asking “okay, what do I do and where do I go from here?” 

I’m just thinking very positively today- but for once I actually believe what I’m saying. I’m excited to reach peak self care (lmao) and learn how to exist alongside my illnesses, because that’s the best thing I can do for myself right now. 

My brain is messed up and living every day is very very difficult. I have a lot of bad days. But for the first time ever, today I was glowing with pride. Even during my darkest days I clawed my way out of the dirt and made it to therapy. Even in the psych ward I was repeatedly asking when I would see a psychiatrist, what the next step would be in my recovery. Through all of the shit life has dragged me through I still made it out the other end, each time with more and more determination to get better. 

Thanks for reading. I’m just really fucking proud of myself :’) ",19Jan2019,1

I don't really find any interest in it and honestly, most of the time would rather just sit and stare at nothing and be distracted.

36,"So title mainly says it all, typical girl stuck on guy bullshit yards yadda. But this is actually very concerning for me, as I’m in a relationship with the perfect partner.

Long story short, my partner (we’ll call him C) and I broke up for a month last year. During this month, I started seeing this guy, we’ll call him D. 

C and I ended up resolving our issues and I broke it off with D, rather abruptly. It was just as sudden for me as it was for him. Of course I still had feelings and tried to bury them and forget about it. I wanted to make my 5 year relationship work. 

And as great as my relationship is with C, as objectively perfect and wonderful as he is, it has been nearly a year and I still find myself daydreaming about D and what we’d be doing if we were together. 

And after knowing D longer (we work together and all) I know id never end up with him, I know that I wouldn’t be as happy and well set up as I am now. I know that he would never be able to treat me as well as C does. D is not nearly the man C is, especially on paper... I know that.  But I guess I just imagined all the stupid fun I would have with D, that I was supposed to have with him.

I mainly think I’m stuck like this because I’m currently working a rather simple job before starting a very rigorous school and career path. I’ve taken a gap year where my friends have all moved on and I’m biding my time and making money before starting school again. It’s been incredibly difficult for me to not be in a rigorous environment, I’ve become rather forgetful and have so many senior moments I think I’m losing my mind.

I think my mind is just stuck on him out of boredom, not that my life is boring with C by any means but because I don’t have as much going on.

It just worries me, because I feel as if I’m somehow cheating C out of what he deserves—a fully loyal partner. Which is something he believes I am and cites my fierce loyalty as one of his favorite qualities of mine. 

I guess what I’m looking for is advice, is this somewhat normal? My mind just working against me because why the hell not? It’s almost like intrusive thoughts I can’t even help... I want it to stop. I just don’t know how.

37,"I've had depression for my entire life, finally talked about it and got on meds when I was 11, was hospitalized in a psych ward twice, and finally got to a point where I could manage it. I knew the meds I ended up on would be bad for me long term, so three years ago I weaned myself off with help from a doctor. It has been fine, beyond small bouts of depression and manageable amounts of anxiety. 

Suddenly today, I had the biggest downward spiral I've had in a long time. This is the lowest I've been in years, just in a day... and I can't even bring myself to talk to my boyfriend about it. He's had to comfort me over stress a lot lately and I think the depression freaks him out because he knows I have a history of self harm.

 I was fine yesterday. I'm not happy in my job overall but today was fine, I just started my period but usually PMS isn't a problem for me, and this winter is no more or less shitty than it has been but I do think winter has some impact, but not to this level. 

I have no energy to do anything, I can't even talk louder than a mumble, nothing is worth laughing or smiling over, the only thing I can do is lie here and cry. I can't remember the last time I felt like this. My boyfriend went to bed and I think he's sick of my brain being so fucked up. I feel bad that I have these problems to begin with. 

I just don't know how to get myself out of this. I can't even try counseling because of my work hours and shitty insurance.

38,"Today in theology class, my teacher made us answer what type of kitchen utensil we would be if we were one, and why. Boring question, but whatever. Some kid said frying pan and the teacher starts talking about how she saw a Facebook post the other day talking about someone’s family. She said that one of the comments said that a family member of theirs was a wife who had an abusive husband, and one day he got blackout drunk so she sewed him into his bedsheets and beat him with a frying pan. She said if as if it was funny, and people in the class laughed too or were just lighthearted about it. That’s fucked up, how can they act like that? I’ve been in situations where I’ve felt just a fraction of what she must have felt to get to that point and it’s fucking terrible. Why would she share that with a class, and why would they act that way? I legitimately had trouble breathing when she said it in class, had a minor anxiety attack. ",19Jan2019,1

40,"I went for a walk the other day with my dad and I expressed how afraid I am for the future. I’m at community college and I’ll soon be making the switch to a 4-year school, but I’m having a lot of doubts about my current major. I work 40 hours a week and am enrolled in 18 credits all while trying to squeeze in my hobby of producing music. I feel my life rushing by me and although I really have no plan for the future, I don’t know how to slow down. 

Anyway, after hearing my troubles, he told me that as much as I worry, he knows I’ll be okay because he sees that I have a work ethic and that I’m more responsible than most 19 year olds and that I’m capable of handling whatever life hits me with. Hearing that made me really proud because I’m not used to anyone praising me like that, even though I never expect it. I’m still very nervous about my future and my goals, but at least I know I have support.

41,"This might be weird but I don't understand sex. I know what it is and I watch porn but I just don't get it. 

I've been told it's pleasurable and that's how kids are made but why do people do it? Is it only for pleasure? For fun? Does it make the people having sex grow closer and love each other more? How do people decide when they want to have sex? Do they have sex with many people or just one? Does having sex mean your in a relationship with someone or not? How many times does it take to get someone pregnant? How long after pregnancy does it take before they have sex again? 

These are things I just don't get. Maybe it's because my sex-ed class was useless or maybe it's because of being raised a Mormon but I just can't seem to wrap my head around sex. I'm in college and everything I know about sex is either from porn or from /r/askreddit threads like the one about pregnancy a week or two ago. 

Maybe once I have sex I'll understand but I haven't even had a real hug in months and pre-marital sex is like the 2nd worst thing you can do in Mormonism and since I'm going to college at BYU-Idaho I would definitely get kicked out if I asked these questions.",19Jan2019,1

45,"So basically, I had planned to ask this girl (we’ll call her J) out to my school’s junior function (basically junior prom). I’ve had a crush on her for a couple months now. We have some mutual friends that introduced us about a year ago. My interest in her began to grow when she started sending me some rather flirty messages.

[Some of them. honestly, looking back I may have misinterpreted them. lmk what you guys think](https://imgur.com/a/hoXMJFQ)

She also made a post on her personal account on Instagram (only like 30 followers) that literally said “date me @“ and then my name. The picture was a bad selfie I sent her through Snapchat. Honestly that whole post was probably a joke

That stuff kind of led me into thinking that J liked me. Then, she invited me to a party at her house with around 15 other people. We were all play the game “paranoia” for those who don’t know, here are the rules

First, everyone sits in a circle

Whoever goes first whispers a question to the person on their right

The person on the right must answer the question out loud using a name from someone in the circle. The trick is, no one else in the circle knows the question

The asker and the answerer play rock, paper, scissors.

If the answerer wins, the question is not revealed to the group and the answerer proceeds to ask a new question to the person on their left and the cycle begins again.

If the answerer wins, the question is revealed to the group *cue awkwardness and embarrassment*

So, J and I both answered with each other’s names when each of us was asked our question. Both of us won the rock, paper, scissors so our questions were never revealed to the group. A close mutual friend (let’s call her E) of J and I’s thought it was cute that we both answered with each other’s names so she did some digging and found out that both of our questions were the same. They were both “who would you date”. When E told me that I got very excited because at this point I did have a crush on her.

I decided to throw a party at my house and I invited J, E and about 15 other people. Honestly main reason I threw the party was because I wanted J to come. Thankfully, J responded with “HELL FUCKING YES!!” When I sent her an invitation. 

I live about a 10 minute walk away from a really nice beach area so I planned to take everyone down there once they all arrived.  I am a very avid photographer and I have a pretty nice camera (I’m honestly considering a career in photography). J knows that. J asks if I can take some photos of her in her bikini at the beach. Well of course I say yes just because hopefully me doing her a favor gets her to like me. We take photos for about an hour, some are group photos with E and some other friends but there are a lot of photos with just her as the only subject. Before you start thinking “eww he’s so gross he’s probably just gonna sin to these photos later”. My mind doesn’t work like that. When I take photos, I’m making art. I can’t get off to my own artwork.

The shoot goes well, we all spend some time in the water, and then head back to my place. There’s a hot tub and a sauna at my house so we go into those and just talk story for a while and play the regular party games like “never have I ever” and “paranoia”.

The party went very well in my opinion. I felt like I got closer to a lot of people. Now here’s where I decided how much I liked J. I took 354 photos total (7.6gb). I shoot photos in a format called RAW. Basically the captures more info than a JPEG which allows for greater light adjustments in editing. When you shoot RAW, you have to edit each photo individually because a lot of the information captured in the RAW file isn’t seen in original photo, you have to bring it out via photoshop or another editing program. I have a pretty good workflow so it takes me about 5 minutes to do a pretty decent edit on one photo. Before you say “why couldn’t you just use a preset for everything”, well I used a lot of different angles and lighting techniques so one preset wouldn’t have covered everything. 354 photos x 5 minutes means 29.5 hours of editing. Yeah, fuck that. I instead narrowed it down to exactly 40 photos and spent a little over three hours editing her photos. Mind you, I’m not getting paid for any of this so it truly came from the heart. I wanted to really impress her so I did it all in one night. 

That’s how much I liked her. I spent around 4 hours so that she could have some nice photos for her Instagram. For senior portraits I charge $40 an hour (which is very cheap) so I was pretty much giving her a free $160 of my time. She sent me a pretty well written thank you and told me in person as well. I was happy.

Sorry for the long I intro I was just trying to give some context as to what happens next 

On Monday she hits me up with this:

[this](https://imgur.com/a/mRW1QC2)

I’m not actually tying to build a portfolio anymore I just didn’t want to say “I’m doing it for free because I have a giant crush on you”. Function is in March so I come up with the idea to make my promposal at the end of the shoot. I spent a while talking with her friends and made a reddit post:

[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/agijhq/so_im_gonna_ask_my_crush_out_to_junior_function/?st=JR37337Q&amp;sh=003560fc) 

She really likes Shawn Mendes so I decided that I would work with that. My plan was, to use photoshop and make a sign that said “There’s nothing holding me back from asking you to function” and I would also put a picture of Shawn Mendes under it. I would then export it and load it onto an SD card and stick it in my camera. So that it would appear on the camera display. At the end of the photo shoot, I was planning on saying something like, “hey this one turned out really nicely” and then show her the sign on the screen of my camera. 

All of her friends said that she would say yes. Apparently she also knew that I was going to ask on Sunday. I thought that my chances were pretty good. 

Here’s where the tea it begins.

Yesterday a person who we’ll call “A” asked J to go to function with him as a friend. J said yes. E texted me about this and was fucking livid. I haven’t had this much emotion flood over me in such a long time. I felt depressed, angry, and confused. It felt like someone just ripped out all of my guts kinda like mortal kombat. I had never felt this bad before. I felt emasculated and all of my self confidence was just gone. Why did she say yes?! I was being eaten away by the fact that I just didn’t know why she said yes. I thought she liked me and I she knew that I was going to ask her. 

I decided to have a group discord call with 2 friends of mine. L and C. C is a close friend of A (the one who asked out J). L thought that J said yes because J is the type of person to get flustered in a situation like that and just say yes.

That was not the case.

This next part is what’s really giving me depression. I’m gonna go with E and talk to a school counselor on Tuesday because it’s really been eating me up inside. I can’t focus on anything else.

Back to the story

C said that he would do some digging for me. He talks to A and finds out that J actually asked A to ask her to function. C told me that A said this: J knew that I was gonna ask her and she knew that she wouldn’t be able to say no to me. So she asked A to ask her so that I wouldn’t be able to ask her. That is all C knew. I don’t know why she didn’t want to go to function with me. When I asked E if she knew why J didn’t want to go to function with me, She told me that  “Idk why, this is her problem this has nothing to do with who you are”. I still feel pretty shitty though. 

At this moment, the photography thing on Sunday was mutually cancelled. I am currently debating whether or not I should just straight up ask J why she didn’t want to go with me. I don’t think I have ever felt this depressed with my life. I’ve been having long talks with L and C and it makes me feel better temporarily. But then the question of why she didn’t want to go with me keeps eating away at me. Hopefully the school counselor is able to help.

I tried one thing today that I thought would make me feel better and distract me from my current predicament and it helped for about 2 hours. I run this club at school where we pretty much have sword fights every Friday in this big grassy area called the “quad”. The swords are made out of half inch diameter pvc pipes covered with a foam pool noodle and then wrapped in duct tape. The club is about 8 years old and the presidency was passed down to me last year because I am the best swordsman in the club. There are usually about 40 people that show up so the 20v20 battles are really fun (I actually video some of the battles if y’all wanna see them). My favorite mode is called freshman slaughter. We put all of the freshman on one side of the quad and all of the upperclassmen on the other side. It’s always an absolute slaughter. I can run through a whole group of like 10 freshman and just beat them all. It’s really fun and is a great stress reliever. Who wouldn’t want to hit a freshman with a pvc pipe? What shocked me is that sometimes in the middle of a battle today, that question of “why didn’t she want to go to function with me” randomly popped into my mind and I just had to stop and take a break. My plan to distract myself did not work.

I have never felt such strong feelings of depression in my life. My stomach hurts like I’m hungry but I don’t want to eat.
I just can’t figure out why she didn’t want to go with me and that question has literally been giving me depression for the past 2 days. 

“I am thinking about sending J this:
I have been pretty down on myself throughout yesterday and today. I found out the entire story of what happened. There’s just this one question that’s been eating me away. Why didn’t you want to go to function with me? Sorry if that question sounds so demanding but it has really been messing with my self image for the past 2 days. Did I do something to offend you? Am I overstepping my boundaries by asking you? Do you just find me unattractive or weird? What is it? This question has been driving me crazy since yesterday and I just can’t focus. I would really appreciate it if you could give me an answer”

If you guys have any advice, I would love to hear it

TLDR; This girl I’ve liked for a while who has been flirting with me for like 2 months rejected me in the weirdest way possible. She knew that I was going to do a promposal on Sunday at the end of a photo shoot that she asked me to do for her. Yesterday, she asked someone else to ask her to prom so that I wouldn’t be able to ask her. She apparently knew that she wouldn’t be able to say no to my ask and did not want to go with me. I have yet to figure out why and this has left me in a state of depression, anger, and confusion. I’m going with a close friend to see the school counselor on Monday so hopefully that helps. 

Also, to the one person at my school who has figured out who I am on reddit. If you tell people about this or if we aren’t that close and you mention this to me, I will murder you. Ok probably not that, but I’ll find a way to make to suffer. Maybe I’ll hit you with a pvc pipe.",19Jan2019,1

53,"Not far from an hour ago, there was an accident in my neighborhood and my aunt and uncle went to check it out. As they left, I hadn’t really noticed. I did in fact notice the occasional cats that would enter our gate and eat the food we set out for them.

The man was down on his back, blood was leaking from the back of his head and neck, and the whole thing was just a mess. I really doubt he could’ve survived after how nasty of a crash that was.

56,"I sit here with a tremendous feeling of failure and sadness. I haven't been a great Husband or father, don't get me wrong, I haven't been a bad husband or father either, but thats just how I feel, I don't even know what my wife or daughter would say on the subject. My wife has just told me after 29 years she no longer loves me and feel she may need her own space, and although I am in my daughters life I don't feel I am as close to her as I should be, although it is always been said that we are quite alike. So the last week or so has really made me think about who I am and why I am the way I am, I cannot get the very heavy feeling of sadness that I did not try hard enough, and its all on me.

In my heart I know that I am a kind, trusting, genuine and generous person, who would do anything for anyone, although my blunt honesty and not suffering fools can make it look from the outside that I can be mean and not very tolerant. I have become overweight, and although I do take pride in my appearance, as I always have, I feel this has really knocked an already fragile confidence and played into my insecurities as I feel people do judge you for what you look like, first impressions and all that. Apparently “clients don't do business with fat people” another pearl of wisdom from a complete piss poor morally, cunt!

I am a very honest person, integrity, loyalty and faithfulness and key pillars of what I would call my inner self, these are instilled in me, I am not sure what has happened to make me this way, but I have found that it has held me back in someways when it has come to business and making money. A business partner once said. “if it wasn't for your bloody principles we would be making far more money” at the time I took it as a compliment, and this came from the same guy who said fat people don't do well in business! I do pick em. I sometimes do feel I should just drop the integrity and my principles and just get on with making myself financially secure, but I couldn't, I wouldn't be able to live with myself.

I am not an angry person, and it takes a lot to get me there, but thats not to say I don't get angry because sometimes in life you do, and thats normal. I abhor violence, I have luckily only had a two episodes in my life where I had to deal with real violence, one when I was in my early twenties, and the other about a week or so ago.

A violent incident with my daughters boyfriend, coupled with my wife telling me its over, and turning 50 has tipped me over the edge of an already struggling life, a life where for the last few years has just had this heavy burden of failure and sadness that I just cannot be rid of. Really has left me shell shocked and wondering whether life itself is worth bothering with, don't get me wrong, although I have thought about killing myself, I am not 100% sure I could go through with it, but just having it there as an option that pops up in your head isn't good is it.

I would say I am insecure and lack confidence in myself and my abilities, But from the outside Im not sure you would ever guess this, as I have always come across as confident and someone who gets what they want. When it comes to my abilities it makes no sense, I have achieved an awful lot of good stuff, and in my career I am good, in fact not just good I am awesome when I am firing on all cylinders, guess its “fake it till you make it” but never dealt with it, kinda thing, so it all crumbles. 

With all thats happened in the last decade, especially in the last two years, these insecurities have really started to come to the surface. The last few weeks have really broken me, I cant hide this any longer, I have truly fucked up, and now scrabbling around trying to see how I deal with this.

When I try and think about how I feel, my thought processes etc, its like there is something in my head telling me I do not deserve anything, I don't deserve such a fantastic and supportive wife, I don't deserve to achieve my dreams, and when I have ever achieved anything, its like I am waiting for someone to tap me on the shoulder and say excuse me, what do you think you are doing, you don't belong here or deserve any of this. I cannot explain this, I don't know where it comes from, childhood? I had a normal childhood and pretty spoilt at times, there is no trauma, abuse or anything, my parents were together throughout, so no divorce to blame, well not until I was 19 anyway, it perplexes me. You are told, knowing why is half the battle, well thats just fucking great!

I tell myself that it could be a lot worse, and I know it could, but each person problems, are theirs to own, and theirs to deal with, regardless how insignificant they maybe to the outside world, they are huge to that individual. I am expected to man up, stiff upper lip and all that, its bollocks we all suffer one way or another, being a man has nothing to do with it.

Looking into the fear of failure, an interesting article says it could be a fear of success. We convince ourselves that we are doing all we can to succeed in whatever goal we what to achieve, but we are subconsciously sabotaging in our brains and not doing all we can. If this is true why? Am I subconsciously sabotaging my own life because I feel I don't deserve it? How do you get a breakthrough with this? Rant over ",19Jan2019,1

Went to sit with some other students at the seating area. While waiting, I saw a mega-cute dude standing with some friends. Dude wasn’t wearing an ID badge so I assumed he was a student in the university. Dude had snow white skin, raven black hair, and the cutest fucking face I’ve ever seen. Literally in awe at the God-like levels of cute that was emanating from this dude.

Had to leave with other students for first half of the program. Disappointed to see the dude go in another direction.

Lunchtime comes.

Lunchtime ends.

Go to second half of program. Fucking stoked to see that the dude is here. Realize he must be one of the volunteer students for this half.

Give him a onceover.

See bumps on his chest. Rubs eyes, looks again. Dude turns to the side.

Dude is not a dude.

Feel somewhat disappointed.

Realize that she’s still mega cute.

I go to activity with some robots and stuff. She comes over to see how we’re doing. I gather up some balls for once in my life and actually talk to her.

We exchange names, talk about common interest etc. just regular first-time meeting stuff.

Actually end up having more than one conversation with her. We talk about more stuff. Feel pretty happy with myself.

Walk out the program like a Lvl 100 Boss.

Realize that I didn’t ask for her number.

Realize that I’ll probably never see her again unless I join the university next year.

63,"I'm a 25 year old guy and grew up very conservative. Sex was this super bad, now I'm older I'm not conservative and know its not. I still have a lot of guilt from watching porn or doing anything sexual. Sometimes I go online and try to find other people to talk with about it or to be sexual with. Its a combination of a lot of things. Part of its loneliness, just want to do something sexual with a woman, preferably someone who I get to know. But its also that I'm trying to surround myself with people who are very sex positive and will encourage me to be sexual and not feel guilty about it, online is the safest place to do that. 

So thats brings me to my current frustration. A while back I found this really good discord server. I joined it, it was small, just getting started, but I really enjoyed talking with the people on it and they knew how to be casual about everything like I wanted. Then I got super guilty and deleted my discord account, later I made another discord account and joined again, only to feel guilty and delete THAT discord. So I made ANOTHER discord account but by now the original link to the discord I have is dead. It doesn't work. I went through a TON OF trouble on discord to recover my original account but Ive been removed from the channel and can't seem to join again. it just doesn't seem to even exist. 

I can't send messages to anyone from the server cause I'm not on it and we never became friends on discord. I Just want to curl up in a ball and its so stupid that I feel this way. All of this emotional bullshit just cause I want to be able to talk about porn and share it with someone, which is admittedly weird I get that. I can't find anyone to voice chat with cause lets be real I'm a guy online and women arn't exactly lining up to talk with a guy about sexual stuff online, once again I get it , its reasonable to think that way. I'm just tired and frustrated. 

Mostly I""m just angry at myself for shooting myself in the fucking foot. ",19Jan2019,1
65,"I was abused and bullied as a kid which caused me to develop fairly serious social anxiety and I withdrew from social interactions for a few years while dealing with other related problems.

Fast forward to the past year or more, and I've been longing for friendship. I have been trying to take steps to find friends and improve some of my antisocial behaviours which had become second nature to me.

A month or so ago, I found someone who I got along with and knew was my friend. They are probably the best or 'only' friend I've ever had if you exclude my poor experiences during childhood.

Recently I realised that I've developed an unhealthy attachment to them. I constantly ruminate on whether they like me or not, whether I did something wrong or annoyed them, whether they like their other friends more than me. I constantly think about talking to them, what to say and what to talk about. I constantly have to make a conscious effort not to engage in intrusive, obsessive or self-destructive behaviours.

I cry myself to sleep often and have been experiencing anxiety and intrusive thoughts. I haven't felt this way since I was a child being bullied in school by people I never did anything to.

I know on an intellectual level that the things I'm worried about are irrational, obsessive and intrusive, but on an instinctive level I have no clue what I'm doing. 

I feel like a useless, worthless, undesirable, insecure wreck.

I live in a house with a no-smoking rule.  Recently I woke up feeling like dying and got rushed to ER.  I was actually dying.  They kept me for a while after to make sure I stabilized and let me go.

It turned out one person here had been smoking in the house.  And yes, I am that allergic, like some people to peanuts, but it wasn't just a cigarette, he went through a pack in an hour as a stress thing and almost killed me.  So long talks, he isn't smoking in the house anymore.

I woke up early this morning to the same ""I'm dying"" sensation but way more reduced.  Knowing the last one was allergy induced, I get up and leave my room.  I smell smoke so go to this guy's room.  He's halfway down his first cigarette.

I leave and immediately start feeling better.

Yes guys, smoking kills, even if you are a non-smoker.  I put a lot of effort into my life and I almost died from somebody else's bad habit.  I can't leave this situation right now nor do I want to attack the guy (in a way I want to because first time OK real crappy but he didn't know it would kill me, second time are you serious buddy?) but I am genuinely stuck here for a while, there is no way he will be evicted (not landlord but his parents own the house) and I'm stuck here with risk of this happening again and again.",19Jan2019,1
70,"While I was out drinking last night, I must have lost my keys at some point because I cannot find them.

What I know is I left my apartment at 7pm and I had my keys then. Walked to a bar and took my jacket off, which also had the pocket my keys are usually in. Haven’t called this place yet because they aren’t currently open but I’m going to when I can. Least likely place they would be.

From there my friends and I walked to another bar. Called this bar and they said they didn’t find any keys. After that we walked back to our apartment to meet up with others. Any of these spots I was walking through I could have lost my keys, but I had not had much to drink yet. So I don’t think it’s likely.

Once we got back to the apartment I decided to get comfy while we waited to go back out so I took off my jacket and I think I emptied my pockets in my bedroom. I think. Can’t remember if I did for sure. That’s why I think they could be in my place. I just don’t know where. Checked my bed and pretty much anywhere else I thought they could randomly be but no luck so far.

We leave and walk to another nearby bar, and I don’t remember if I had my keys on me at this point or not. Need to call this bar and ask if they found any keys too.

Last place we went to by car, and while I was at this bar I realized I didn’t have my keys. Went out and checked the car, nothing there. I didn’t pull my keys out of my pockets for any reason either. I guess I’ll need to call this one too.

So I lost my keys between 7pm leaving my apartment and 1am leaving the 4th bar. They could be at any of the bars, any of the roads I walked on, or in my place somewhere. I guess someone could have snatched them from my pocket, but I don’t know why someone would go for keys without a house or car... right? 

This seriously makes no sense. I’m going to do a walkthrough of where I went if I can’t find them. If they were turned in by someone, would a fire station or police station have them? Any other places I could try and call about this?

80,"So my hubby and I are in our late-30's. I'm the wild one, he's the conservative bore (I love him, but I can only hear about mathematics for so long lol).

He never drinks over excess. Except this year, out with a few couples, he had a couple too many. Not so bad. Nice to see him cut loose.

As the clock was nearing midnight, I went outside looking for him. Where was he? I have to kiss my dork at midnight.

As the count reached 10, and he wasn't there, I heard our friends' incredibly LOUD laughter, as well as a few wolf whistles.

""HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!! WOOOOOOO!!!!!!""

There's my husband streaking down the street. Hands to the sky

Buck-ass fucking naked.

My hubby. The one who never takes off his shirt in the pool. In his adorable birthday suit for all to see.

Not fat, but dad bod in all its glory for the world to see (he's not a dad, but he has the bod lol). His round belly bouncing. His slight man-boobs bouncing. His bare white ass jiggling. And his penis flapping in the breeze.

I burst out laughing too. ""Hey Baby New Year, wheres your diaper, you're NAKED!""

He turned and looked at me in horror, almost like I snapped him out of a trance, covered his package with his hands sheepishly to loud laughter from our friends and ran towards the back door getting his naked ass in the house.

I now have 2 photos. One of my butt-naked husband, head to bare feet, mid-run, eyes wide, mouth open looking at the camera in horror. Dick and balls in the wind. And another of his cute plump ass running for cover into the house.

Whenever I bring it up he is MORTIFIED hahahaaaa.

93,"I was naive. I would take the pills on and off. I was always trying to figure out why I was sad, lethargic, iratable, quiet, anxiety. I would fix my sleeping schedule, try to get more sun, better my diet. It never once hit me until this last November when Eureka I finally questioned my pills. I was oblivious to the side effects and the withdrawal and rebounds I was constantly neglecting. I was miserable and taking more drugs than anytime in my life. Weed, Cigarettes, Alcoholism you name it. I developed Anthrophobia and didn't leave my house for four month's. I lost my girlfriend, all of my closest friends, relations with my family, and just about any relationship I had. I self destructed and had a meltdown. My entire life disintegrated into nothing.

Don't know how I mustered the courage to go see my doctor but I did and I got on new pills. Around this time I started feeling slightly better but also a lingering numbing feeling. Soon I was unable to cry. I was frightened because I was still pretty damn depressed and I couldn't express it. I felt like a sense of mine had been erased from exsistance. I soon turned to drinking again as I found it was the only conduit I could use to cry myself to sleep. One day I got really drunk and added to the fact that its mixed with my medications, turned me into a belligerent fool. My own family called the cops on me and I was later arrested for public intoxication and resisting arrest. Four hours after I was released from jail I walked all the way home. I was so furious with myself and the world. I was so angry that 1 hour after I was released I punched a palm tree with the force of a thousand sun's and got a bad Boxer Fracture on my right hand; severly crippling my pinky, ring, and the right side of my Carpals. 

After all this mess I just wanted the year to be over. Showed up to court after a sad Christmas. I got let off easy and my right hand started to slowly but surely recover.

It baffles me but I don't know how it happened. Its a beautiful thing. On Jan 2, 2019 I started condition training to muster the strength of my body. I had grown overweight due to my static lifestyle. Partnerd with the fact I had a fracture still healing I started from square one. I walked for an hour. I soon started finding different places to walk which then in turn made me go out more. Everyday I was discovering new places and quickly my stamina increased so I could start hiking. I've seen great sights and met interesting people. Its since become addicting and I find it hard to stay indoors. I had found what I was looking for. I was loving myself for the first time. 

Soon I got into the gym and started working out 3 hours a day starting with swimming, running, free weights. I've since aquired the amazing and wonderful skill that is swimming. Its so enjoyable and gives you a rush man I don't know how else to explain it. I'm currently in the best shape of my life. Soon my charisma shined and I was no longer at the dead end of the introverted spectrum. Started fixing my posture, taking care of my face and getting rid of about 90% of my acne, sleeping adequately and precisely, eating tons of really healthy foods, gained the ability to talk to anyone, traveling every single day, and following my dreams to become a musician by learning guitar, synthesizer, and music recording programs. I'm seeing the world in a whole new light. What I learned is that the world is out there for you so conquer it there nothing you can't do the only one who can truly stop you is yourself. Don't worry about it just do it and make it happen.

My little brother hid upstairs and listened, although he pretended he didn’t for our sakes. He knows far too much for a ten year old. Even though my mum didn’t overdose this time, I think this has been the worst. She grabbed onto me, clenched my wrist in her hand and pulled me towards her as she screamed. I could hear my dad sobbing for her to not hurt me.
 I will never be able to get that out of my head, the way his voice cracked and wobbled as tears streaked down his face. He’s never been a violent person, says he’s too soft for his own good, but I love that about him.

The funny thing is today I spoke to her like normal. That’s what always happens. A few days of not taking and then everything is forgotten, the times where she threatened to take me away and ruin my life, when she told me that she wanted to make me fail, my only proof of it happening being the ache in my stomach muscles from how hard I cried. It never lasts though, give it a week, two if I’m lucky and she’ll be set off again. 
I wonder what it’s like to be normal sometimes, to be a teenage girl with her only worries being exams and school and a part time job, not having to stress about every action I make, so not to shatter the pretend peace we have.
 
She told me that I was molested a little while ago, by my old neighbour. He’s dead now, so I guess it doesn’t matter but I just wish she had told me in a motherly way, sat me down and held me as I cried about it instead of shouting it at me mid argument to get a reaction. I want to believe it’s a sick lie, made up in the heat of the moment but then I look back at myself and how I behave, bits and pieces of my childhood missing and I cannot deny it.

It's easy to let happen, and it gets to a point where you don't even realize it's happening because it's all you've ever done. But I finally see myself for who I am, and I know that I have value whether someone else sees it or not.

I blindly believed everything people told me. If they said I was pretty, I was. If they told me I was kind, mean, stupid, funny, chubby, or sweet, it was true. They knew best, after all, since they were the ones who saw me from the outside.

But I'm on the inside, and I know better than them.

Never give up your power or your control over yourself. Never do it. It results in a huge lack of identity and because of that, you will look anywhere to find it... sometimes in the right people, but more often in the ones who don't have your best interests at heart.

It's a mantra. I tell myself 100x per day that I'm worth something, and that I am a good person. I've done things that I'm not proud of, but I don't repeat those things, and I atone for them.
