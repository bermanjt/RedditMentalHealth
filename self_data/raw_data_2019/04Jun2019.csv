0,"I (F, 18) have only one friend that I hang out  with and even then it's only ocasionally meaning once every couple of weeks. We consider each other as sisters. But, she is constantly posting pictures of her and her other friends together. I try not to let it bother, because we honestly have different taste in friends and I work everyday of the week. So, how can I really blame her, plus I don't have the money to continually drive places to hang out with her. I'd try to make other friends, but I have no clue how plus no time to. I didn't make friends in college. My last year, I was the only girl in a combined class of around 30 students. I was really shy and lived an hour from the college. So, I didn't socialize in college much. Plus, the class was mostly high school boys. At my main job, I have 2 coworkers, both male, both have girlfriends and their own friend groups. I guess I've become a lone wolf in reality. I like my own space and not constantly being around people. But, sometimes I wish I had people that we shared common interests that I could be around alot more frequently. Also, I dont have a SO either. I love my life don't get me wrong. I just get a little lonely sometimes.",04Jun2019,3
1,"I'm working everyday to focus and change my mindset so I'm not just focusing on things that make me miserable. I have stability (though it isn't permanent) and am working to be able to support myself. I'm happier and getting better. Ive started to identify and quit bad habits. 

But though I'm on the right track, I still will get these intrusive suicidal thoughts at night. I feel like this must be normal in recovery but it's still a grim reminder of how I no longer want to think. 

I guess I'm writing to see if there's anything to do about these thoughts other than just keep moving forward. I've tried and failed many time before to recover and be better. This is the best I've done by far and I want to keep it going.",04Jun2019,1
2,"In school, drama is... frequent. I have some friends who have been casually stranding me and just not talking to me because they don't want to be around me. Okay. Whatever, if they don't want to be around me, they don't have to. I have better friends who want to stay with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Friend 1 - Is essentially blind (has a TA who goes everywhere with him and uses a cane) but the best and most loyal friend ever. Will sit and talk with me whenever possible. Always knows all the gossip because *everybody trusts him.* He doesn't even tell me much, and he trusts me a lot. He is one of the most friendly easygoing people ever, and always up for whatever.

  
Friend 2 - First person who I met going into a new school. He also had not many friends and we figured out that we both shared many interests. In 2 years, there has not been a single day (unless we could not for whatever reason like not enough seats open, not on bus, etc.) where he hasn't sat with me on the bus. I help him with homework and stuff and in return, he is so friendly and funny. Always up for a good practical joke and extremely loyal as a friend.

&amp;#x200B;

Friend 3 - The kid who everyone thinks is weird, fat and dumb. He is, but in the best way possible. The kind of person who doesn't care enough that he will just make random really well-timed jokes about white vans, racism (not being racist but joking about the concept of it... hard to explain), and he also is an award-winning very well known sheep-shower (also shows rabbits and goats) around our area. For example, today in SEL (Social Emotional Learning but we don't do anything but sit there messing around) he and I went around on different car manufacturers' websites and tried to ""Build &amp; Price"" the best white van possible. Complete with an 8-inch touch screen and heated leather seats, of course.

&amp;#x200B;

Friend 4 - The typical misfit. We met because I love NASCAR (not many people do, had never met another kid at schools who liked it) and so did he. He is really easygoing and embraces any insults against him. We go over to each other's houses for all the important races and Mondays during lunch are always endless discussions about the week's race.

&amp;#x200B;

There are other friends who are great to me and aren't trying to abandon me, but I don't want to extend this wallof text any further. Thanks if you've made it this far, sorry.

4,"Cliche, I know. 19 year old teen who thinks he’s in love and can’t get over it. Typically, I like to think of myself as a very sane and rational person, but when it comes to her, I loose. I can’t seem to understand why. It’s been 9 months, and I very often come up with reasoning as to why but none seem to really fit. I miss her every night, but understand she likely doesn’t feel the same way. I focused on myself immensely, I do a lot right now, but nothing helps. I love her lots.

8,They laughed too much also immediately shooed the thought away because it was too dark. We were taking new portraits for the company website. I randomly thought to myself (out of the blue) if I die young and soon they could use these for my funeral. I laughed while telling my coworker and she said “no stop that’s too dark you’re sick.

9,"I was in a really toxic relationship of a year and met this girl (lets call her 'Susan') while volunteering abroad last summer, she was in a relationship too that wasn't the best, we ended up getting too close and we cheated. We were both still vested in our relationships so we never had sex but did other things (a really poor excuse looking back, I know). I regret it and wouldn't ever cheat again. But I developed really strong feelings for her over the month (as did she), and when we went back home, I told my girlfriend and broke up with her, she told her boyfriend but they stayed together (they broke up a couple months later). We were talking and then one day without any notice she completely stopped replying, this hurt me a lot but I moved forward with my life. 8 months later I'm in the best shape of my life and happier than I've been in a while. Me and the girlfriend I cheated on had time apart and worked through our issues by ourselves, and we are now back together and happier and healthier than ever. I thought I had completed moved on from Susan, but a few days ago while in bed with my girl, a mutual friend of ours messaged me saying ""Susan is asking me to ask if it's ok for her to send you a message, she wants to know if its ok first"", I obviously replied 'no I wouldn't be ok with that' due to being in my current relationship and frankly not wanting anything to do with her. But now I'm feeling really confused, and it's really bothering me because I'm happy in my relationship, but some of the feelings are coming back. I would never reach out to her, but I kind of want her to message me to know what she has to say. I have occasionally thought about her over the last 8 months, but not necessarily with the same eyes as before if that makes sense.

I don't know what to do, and how to cope with this. I won't reach out to her, and to be honest I don't really think I want to go there because I do really love my girlfriend, but the feelings are kind of coming in and I need advice.",04Jun2019,3
10,"So one of my best friends tends do go down really toxic paths whenever single. In relationships she’s a very stable person— career focused, healthy lifestyle all that. But whenever she goes through breakups she is someone else. First off, she is treating her Ex TERRIBLY. He is a recovering heroine addict, whom she was with for three long years. Yes their relationship was rocky seeing as they met while on drugs (she got clean, and then he got clean two turbulent years later) however, she never tried heroine and so never had the addiction that he had. She really was there for him, but since they’ve been broken up she’s used him to stay at his house in the city (she lives in a suburb an hour away from her job in the city) she’s used him for sex, knowing he wants to be with her. She’s now starting to party with people who do drugs and talking about having a sugar daddy again (she had one four years ago whenever she was single). 

Long story short. I don’t know how to be a good friend to her. I’ve been honest about her being emotionally irresponsible because of how she’s been treating her ex and her answer was “that’s his problem if he still thinks I’ll get back with him.” I’ve mentioned how she swore off sleeping for money since it made her feel worthless, and she shrugged it off saying that I “think too much.” 

She had a hard upbringing with her abusive dad, so I get the daddy issues... but I just feel too old for this. Uh... any advice? Anyone relate?",04Jun2019,1

12,"I've been really down lately. I've been trying really hard to post videos on youtube and my art on other social medias. So far the best I've gotten were a few likes here and there. Right now it just feels like it's an up hill battle. It's my dream to become a least a little popular. Eventually, I want to make a fantasy epic visual novel series. But what is the point if no one knows about it? It seems like no matter how good you are at art or no matter how much you try, the only thing you can expect is being shot into the internet graveyard. I feel really depressed as its my dream to become an artist and storyteller. I am willing to do all the work, as long as I knew the path I needed to be headed on. I want my words, art, and stories to matter to people. I want people to be so excited to see what I have next in store. I want people to care about my words and to treat me with respect. I want to have a large-ish discord server and not have to worry every day whether it's dead or not. Right now I feel nothing and honestly, I don't see much point in life anymore. What is the point?

16,"I just need to vent. I'm stressing the fuck out and I can't think straight.

Why should I keep this up? It's already 1 month into the summer semester and I failed my first test horribly in algebra. My anxiety is through the roof right now and it's making me stress eat and cry. I'm a 28 year old male for fucks sake.

My classmates are all smarter than me and they have the drive for it. I've been battling with depression and anxiety for years but I keep it under wraps. The last time I told my family if they can not make fun of me for my stress eating they laughed at me and told me I was lieing about stress eating and I only say that to eat more food. It's not. I really do stress eat when my anxiety hits and I try to control it as best as I can but it's no use.

I tried to go see a shrink back in 2012 but the fuck threatened to Baker Act me instead of helping me. So I was given a choice of going there myself and volunteer myself willingly or they'd come get me in force. I spent 2 weeks in the mental ward of a hospital being fed pills and having my blood taken from me ever day. That didn't do anything. If anything it made it worse and I learned to hide myself better.

I've been dealing with this since I was 7 or 8 years old and it has not gotten any better. I know I don't have a long life ahead of me (considering how I eat on the daily and my anxiety gets all kinds of elevated you'd be surprised I lived this far lol) but I want to get this degree in criminal justice. I've been trying here and there since 2011 and I haven't made any progress because I want to help my mother with the bills. If we where more well off I can focus on my schooling a bit more but I need to get money so we can have water and food.

I just wished my mother and father where different. If they never got divorced when I was 17 my downward spiral would be less serve. My mother used my sister and I as weapons against my father to bleed him of his money and it drove me nuts. If they stayed together just a few more years I probably wouldn't be the stressed out fat fuck I am now. Shit because of their violent divorce I had second thoughts about joining the Marine Corps right after highschool. Who would have taken care of my sister?

 Or honestly I wish my mother and father didn't have me at such a young age. It was literally just kids raising another kid.

I'm probably blaming a lot of my misfortune on them... and I am because growing up and even now they are horrible people. Thankfully to a lesser extent these days but they have their moments. My mother sure as shit loves to guilt trip and is hella materialistic and my father might be a pedophile or something as when I was younger he use to drink a lot and would sometimes... do things to me. He also cheated on my mother with my aunt at one point... Said aunt was 16 when the cheating happened and I'll never forgive him for that. I didn't forgive my aunt for a while either but a couple years after that incident I put it as more than likely he did things to her against her will as well.

All because my fucked up family I am who I am today. If I ever find anyone and I have children I pray I won't be like them. If I end up repeating what my folks did to me onto my children or wife I swear on their safety and wellbeing I will kill myself. 

After all children take after their parents and that right there terrifies me.

I'm sorry for starting this out with algebra and ending with talks of self harm if history repeats itself in me but this algebra class is seriously stressing me the fuck out.

I wished I joined the Marine Corps back when my teenaged self was still skinny and I still have a sliver of hope left. I don't think they'll take someone as fucked up and old like me these days.",04Jun2019,1
17,"This girl has been dragging me down for too long now, I swear I feel astoundingly happy whenever we’re together but i really cannot stand how things got so fucked up. She’s constantly running in between me and her ex and it’s probably one of the most toxic things since Chernobyl. That dude is an absolute shitbag of a person and I can’t seem to face that she is too, constantly lying to me and assuring that we had a future.

I’m an apathetic loser but I would really try for her, that future we imagined seemed worth fighting for. Besides dealing with all the heartbreak from being tricked by her once more I’m also worried sick. We had unprotected sex sometimes before I cut contact and I really wouldn’t want her showing up pregnant at my door. Not that I would surely be the father, mind you. Ever since we rekindled and starting hooking up again she was doing the same with her ex, not gonna lie.

In the mean time my husband did laundry over the weekend at the motel which has been fine till now. The crackheads stole 3 of my nice tanks probably because it's getting hot And they stole my freaking underwear. 

I'm tired of this. I grew up around my abusive crackhead family members and got out of it. I move half way across the country to do better and all I get is my home burnt down by a crackhead, stalked by a crackhead who thought my husband and I were someone else, and MY clothes stolen from a crackhead.

33,"First some background here. I'm a pretty independent person (26F)  aka I'm damaged and scared to love. Mostly I'm scared because I come across as a ""sweet person"" but I have a lot of darkness in my past. More times than not, once guys hear stories or see me broken up about things, they start to back off. 

For example, I told an ex that I had been violated on a date. I started to tear up because this was less than 3 months after it happened and I hadn't told anyone. He replied, with a disgusted face, ""I don't want to know things like that about you."" And we sat in silence. 

Since then (it's been 5 years) I've been closed off emotionally. I would casually date, just for some sort of intimate connection. I truly missed the feeling of someone knowing all my flaws and still loving me. It's funny how you can miss something you've never had. I had never been in a healthy relationship before. I didn't know how. 

There was a guy (32M) I would see sometimes that I was instantly attracted to. He was so handsome but this was something else. Like, I had known him before. I can't explain it even if I tried. 

Fast forward 3 months and we're dating and it's the first time I felt like myself in so long. And not in the ""we hang out and sleep together"" type dating way. We waited months to sleep together, but were mutually exclusive. We would talk for hours, go grocery shopping and cook together and it was always so hard to leave him. I genuinely enjoyed his company and loved seeing him smile. Cheesy I know ;) I saw myself as an object for most of the men I dated, since they didn't bother to get to know who I am as a person. It was the opposite with this guy. I felt so good about myself that he wasn't just trying to jump into bed with me and that we really had a genuine connection. I told him things I'd never shared with anyone who wasn't family. I'm an emotional person, but I keep it to myself. 

One day, 3 months after we started seeing each other, I was so stressed because things were crashing down all around me. The biggest one being that I found out my dog had cancer. I loved her so much. She was my only constant I'd known in my adult life. My little angel. I only have two family members in my life. I was always running because the world had hurt me a lot. I felt like I was going to be all alone in the world without my sweet babygirl. 

I had felt so alone and broken at this point and I lost it and told him how everything was making me feel defeated. I was scared, that at that moment I had exposed myself and he would see how messed up I was. He looked me straight in the eyes and told me he was there for whatever I needed. Then he said that ""its probably not the right time to say this"" but that he loved me. He said that he could never get tired of me or feel overwhelmed. He was blown away that a person like me could have so many scars and yet still be nice to others and that he loved all of me, good and the hard stuff to talk about. I'd never had someone care for me the way he did. I knew I loved him shortly after we met. It was an incredibly refreshing feeling to actually want to love someone because they made my heart feel secure. 

Now, I'm completely and utterly still in love with him. We bring each other up. We don't control one another or demand anything. We care about each other, and I feel like he was a gift sent to me after I thought the world was too ugly to bear.

Its possible to feel love even after so much damage has been done, but I learned how to give my love to the right person. I learned from him what a healthy relationship looks like. Too much of my life I had been getting myself into questionable situations where it was inevitable that they would end up badly for everyone involved. I started to give up on love, that maybe it just wasn't for me. He showed me that unconditional love still exists in the world. 💙

34,"5 years ago this month, I suffered an 'aural blast' (or acoustic trauma), while working at a call center. I was exposed to a loud dial twice that was only a second long, but it was loud enough to cause some serious hearing problems, like tinnitus and hyperacusis along will swelling of the ear canal and poor sleeping habits. 

Unfortunately things started to get worse over time to the point where I'm suffering cognitive problems like memory issues, dissociative episodes, near black outs and possibly light seizures since I twitch a lot when I sleep apparently. Naturally this makes things really hard when it comes to living a normal life, especially since loud noises hurt my ears and makes me suffer from a migraine (or cause bleeding in my ears), so much so that I end up staying at home more often than not (besides work) and it gets boring rather quickly.

What's worse still, is that I don't qualify for disability or any sort of financial assistance and have to pretty much power through most symptoms since almost all of the doctors I've seen either never heard (no pun intended) of my problem or care. So I've been left holding the bag all this time and I'm so very tired of it all to the point where I just don't care anymore some days what happens to me.",04Jun2019,1

She told me about the first time her husband physically abused her. In a drunken rage, he pushed her down. She fell into a doorway and her hand caught the door frame. He then slams the door onto her hand, breaking a few bones. The second time, she gets home from dinner with a friend and he is there drunk. He shoves her down and chokes her.

I told her that he ""hit"" her and she got angry at me for saying that because it wasn't the truth. I chalk it up as a semantics issue, but at the end of the day I feel that he hit her.

I guess I have two questions. Was I right for saying that he hit her? And was she justified in getting angry with me for misrepresenting what happened?",04Jun2019,1
38,"So just out of curiosity I set my tinder to men for about 5 minutes. I have the gold version so I can see who swiped right on me beforehand. In just that time I did far better than I have swiping with women in the last month. I had like 10+ likes, a few of whom were objectively good looking and interesting, even if I didn't necessarily find them sexually attractive. I swiped right on one of the guys just for the hell of it and he enthusiastically messaged me within like 30 minutes. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is in such contrast to the last 2 years I've spent on tinder with women, where I've edited my profile dozens of times and constantly tried to micro-manage my own personality just in the hopes of maybe getting coffee. There's no way this has been good for my mental health. And even off tinder I feel like it's the same way. I graduated college last year and work at a small software company, so I don't meet really any women in real life. 

&amp;#x200B;

And I know a lot of people say to just not worry about it and let the time come. But at a certain point you start to question whether you're really taking an active part in the human experience and it makes you sad. It makes me sad when I look back at all the experiences I missed in college and I absolutely do not want to be 30 years old thinking the same thing about my 20s. The most human interaction I get now is from fucking podcasts. I want to converse with someone on an intimate level. That's really the biggest thing, even beyond the explicit, sexual/romantic stuff. Just the idea of being able to love someone and be intimate with someone that you communicate with and connect to on an emotional level, even if you're not really sexually attracted to them. I've never had that.

&amp;#x200B;

Idk I feel like I'm rambling but if you're reading this and have ever lacked human interaction so much that you tried to turn yourself gay, I'd like to hear about it",04Jun2019,4
39,"Hi, just venting a little right now... just kinda in a daze and I need to talk it out a little so I can hopefully go to sleep soon and just hopefully forget about this all if I’m lucky, but probably not. I don’t know it’s just been a weird day. I had a great time this afternoon with my best friend, we went swimming and tanning and it was great. I come home a little later than I thought I would, and rushed to get dinner ready for my dad since my mom was gone at her work out class this evening. Eventually my dad comes home from work and I can immediately tell he’s exhausted and frustrated, just not feeling good at all. I didn’t press him about anything cause I’m just too awkward at that sometimes, but eventually I dish him up dinner and tell him hopefully he feels better(cause my food is pretty amazing and usually he loves it) he eventually tells me he just had a horrendous day at work and that they were understaffed and whatnot, totally understandable. 
My mom comes home, obviously tired from her work out class and idk she probably had a sucky day at work too it sounds like. And wouldn’t you know it but our stupid puppy manages to run out the gate and suddenly I’m out chasing after her cause she’s an insane stubborn puppy and her recall is still a work in progress, my mom is screaming and emotional, my dad is quiet and frustrated as I’m trying to catch our stupid dog. Finally we get her back inside the yard and I finish doing what I was doing outside and I come in and we’re all just basically set to stew in our own emotions and frustrated anger and exhaustion because nobody damn well knows how to express themselves in this family apparently. My mom can’t stop crying cause she’s just an emotional wreck whenever something happens it’s just how it is and neither dad nor I know how to help, and asking just seems to make it worse. So it eventually progresses to them fighting and then I think finally calming down enough to do some heart to heart talking about what needs to happen so this marriage can work kinda thing, but they’ve tried that before plenty of times and they always wind up back here so idk how well this is gonna work... and here I am on the sidelines, too damn empathetic to emotionally handle their fights too well, and powerless to do anything which I hate. I hate when I can’t solve a problem. And now it bugs me that I’m almost freaking 20 years old and I still cry silently in my room whenever they fight, and it’s a small house so I hear almost everything most of the time. I hate that I can see and understand the two of them for the most part but they can’t understand each other. Just ugh, I wish I could move out and not really have to deal with their fighting anymore. It’s so emotionally draining and I hate it. I just wish they could stop fighting. 

Tldr: it’s just been an emotional roller coaster of an exhausting day and I just had to ramble and work through some of my emotions and thoughts so I could stop crying and hopefully go to bed a little calmer.

Idk if I’m necessarily looking for advice, it’s my life it’s just shitty sometimes, but idk I hate how emotional my parents fighting makes me, I just feel like a big baby right now and I should be able to handle it and maybe even help fix it but I can’t. Idk, does anyone else feel this way? Is this normal? Is it okay to feel this way? I hate being emotional, probably  because my mom is such a freaking goddamn emotional basket case sometimes and I’ll be damned if I’m going to be anything like her.",04Jun2019,4
40,"Rant about shitty mods


So life’s been rough lately, like real rough. As in fall ill, lose your job, family and home rough. I could go into all the details but I’m a little bummed out from this experience that I’d rather not.

I reached out to a certain subreddit on here that I thought might have been able to help me. It’s summer time, my husband and our puppy are currently living in a broken down RV. It’s summer. It gets really hot in cars in summer. We only have two fans in the RV and that doesn’t keep it cool enough. I requested a box fan or two explaining how despite everything else, I’m really just concerned about our pup overheating. At max we’ve given him two baths a day (to keep him cool). Of course I could just be over reacting and he’s fine but I wouldn’t want to take that chance. I already signed up for food stamps and unemployment, but our car is broken down and our small amount of income really only covers food and gas for now.

So naturally, as a redditor for 7 years I figured I’d turn to Reddit for some help. 

Granted, I didn’t read over the rules when I first submitted the post so I didn’t know my other account violated a rule. I pmed the mods and they explained the rule violation. I supplied them with proof of my other account and how I wasn’t posting because obviously this is a somewhat hard and embarrassing situation to be in. 

No response.

So I post on my other account, again, just requesting a box fan to keep our puppy cool and they ban that account. I get a new message from the mods (two different mods respond) saying both accounts were banned from posting (even though the one met their criteria..) and then the mod I spoke with earlier chimed in saying how “a mod would have never said that” and I pointed out how we talked earlier. Then they said oh yea they remember and blocked me from messaging the admins :) but how would they have known about both accounts being linked if they didn’t read my original? Afshdjfk

OVERALL, that was the most embarrassing thing I have ever dealt with. Your a sub based on good actions and you treat me like that? I even asked if I could no longer post if they maybe had some resources outside of reddit they knew of that I could check out for help. I already go to the local food pantry once a month. I go to the library twice a week because we only have enough to buy one person a phone plan a month. (My husband takes priority because he works) I have no friends or family I can ask for help, and me and my husband have been working as much as we can to make shit work. Unfortunately a fan isn’t in budget, and that’s fine. It’s uncomfortable but we’ll live. That’s why I reached out because i saw someone already received a fan, another person who was having a bad day, a coffee. I thought I was 100% in the right place. Instead I just feel made a fool of for having the smallest blip of faith and idk. I guess I’m just so upset because when you’ve lost everything, and you get so excited over something that 4 months ago wouldve been no problem, it just messes you up.

I even excitedly told my husband last night I may be able to solve the problem (he doesn’t use reddit or much internet) so it seemed like an even more silly situation to him. How can you gatekeep when people need help? Or treat them so rudely? I think this is just everything bubbling up at once. I’m just embarrassed and ashamed and I’ll just keep to doing everything on my own. Fuck you.


Anyone still reading, if you know of any resources (govt or private) that could help us out I’d greatly appreciate it. We’re in the US.",04Jun2019,1
41,"He never even wanted to communicate his issues,  never even wanted to try and bridge the gap. Just out of the blue, like that after lying that it all was ok. He wanted the satisfaction of utterly shattering a girl like his ex did to him, leaving him suddenly and leaving him bereft for 5 years after dating her one year. But she left him because he was immature, because he was. childish, and challenge and change terrified him.

I was not going to give him that satisfaction for being broken down and immobilized years after. instead, I gave him a harsh reminder that he isn’t even trying in life and thus it’s no surprise he isn’t even trying to bridge the gap. 

He lives in Lala land, where it’s always puppy love and life is perfect, and he runs when reality sets in and he actually has to rise to the occasion.  27 years old, not even finished undergrad after 9 years, not even over his ex, employed for the first time in a year part time, and gets agitated when people try to motivate him. It’s not going to be puppy love forever, and he is so stagnant he mistook the evolution to a more domestic relation to the dying of the light.

There’s a reason those two girls didn’t want to commit to him, there’s a reason his ex dumped him, there is a reason I am walking away now, not him. Thank god he only wasted 82 days of my life. His life is a hot mess, and he is intimidated when people tell him to get his shit together, especially when women tell him to get his shit together because you know, no one wants to be married to a perpetual undergrad pizza delivery man. 

I’m free at last! And soon he’ll find himself replaced by someone hotter, and more importantly, more ambitious and put together.

Sorry if this makes no sense because I’m just getting through it myself. 

TLDR; “It’s not you, it’s me, we’re not going anywhere.” Fuck yea, it’s totally you, it’s not that we’re not going anywhere, it’s that you aren’t going anywhere.”",04Jun2019,7
42,"Does anyone else feel like it would be impossible to meditate after smoking weed? When I’m high, I can’t seem to stop thinking or doing things. Most people partake in it bc it makes them feel relaxed and it helps them stop thinking about toxic topics. 
I blame my anxious thoughts on getting caught so many times but now I’m getting a lil worried bout myself. I consider my ‘high’ personalty just as important as my not high being....
I’ve realized that when I’m high, my personality becomes less confident and bc of that I distract myself with a ton of thoughts that honestly come through my mind sounding like a mouse talking really fast and shivering. 
I’m fucking weird when I’m high hahahaha but I truly do love myself. I love how I talk to myself. And I really believe journaling is considered talking to yourself.

Not like oranges, in fact not even citrusy, just orange. And I told my friends, (because I hate when I smell orange it’s highly unpleasant) and all of them were like wtf do you mean you smell orange?? 

So I guess where I’m going with this is is that not normal? Do you guys seriously not smell something in colors sometimes? It’s always just been normal for me to occasionally smell something and be like ‘oh, oh that’s very purple’ or orange or etc. It only happens with smell and it’s pretty seldom but frequent enough that I assumed this was something everyone had happen, but now I’m so confused.

44,"I’m a 21 year old with no job, I love with my grandparents with my boyfriend in my old room from highschool. I never went to college because I can’t afford it. After highschool I moved to Southern California with my boyfriend and my cat where I had a good job at a brewery and we rented a nice one bedroom apartment. 

I always planned on moving to nor cal with my best friend so she can finish college at a uni and I thought maybe I can work and go to community college too. So my boyfriend and I moved from our apartment to his moms house in northern Washington so we could save money to move. My dumbass got a tattoo apprenticeship that was actually amazing but I couldn’t finish it because we had to move again to my grandparents house so we can be closer to the area we are looking to move. I can’t even get a job because we are trying to move within a month but no one will rent to us. 

I feel so stupid because all my friends have gone or are going to college and I’ve never been smart but now I REALLY don’t feel smart at all being around people with basic education. 

When I first moved to my grandparents again my cat got out somehow in the middle of the night and in some freak of nature way someone hit him with their and killed him.

I know he’s a cat but this is a cat that was with me when I was doing so shitty in my life I tried to commit suicide, he was like a son to me and now he’s gone. Ever since then things have been terrible.

48,"So I don’t know if I’m over reacting. 

Overview from this conflict: I, 21(F) about 5’7 have gained weight within the past few years 174lbs now. It honestly didn’t bother me but my mother (41F) almost on the daily nags at me that I need to lose the weight so that I can look better. I understand where she is coming from but before I was like 130lbs I felt so ugly because I was skinny &amp; she would still call me fat! She tells me that I need to loose weight or that I gained weight in from of family members, friends, my boyfriend, everybody! I’m like “?????” Was that necessary. It makes everything awkward. 

I had no tits, no butt and when I started gaining the weight I felt better because I didn’t feel like a twig.

I’m not someone who likes to show that it’s bothering me (because it didn’t most of my life) but to know you’ve actually have gained weight &amp; feel your self esteem has broken down a bit does bother me.

I do plan to get into a healthier weight like in the 145ish weight to feel good about myself but it’s hard to workout because I always work! I tell her that I work 12-16 hours a day &amp; im tried AF. It’s hard working &amp; not wanting to snack.

He used to always make time for me when i needed it, and it's good that he's making more time for himself! He's busy and has important things to do like everyone does! But I'd be lying if I said I wasn't the slightest bit saddened.

Either way, I hear a good way to be less clingy is to stay off the phone and to pursue hobbies. And I wanna focus on that. Another way is to gain better self esteem and that ones a doozy. So I'm going to start writing again and maybe play more video games. I still never beat Halo.",04Jun2019,2
50,"I've been starting to get agitated out of nothing. My heart starts to beat a little faster, my head starts to think faster and i get in some kind of rush even though nothing happened. I can be laying on bed and that will happen. What can that be ?",04Jun2019,1
51," 

This is a little embarrassing, and has been on my mind for the past year now. I've been having panic attacks, they say, but it feels like much more. Chest pain, like I'm having a heart attack but minor, difficulty swallowing and sense of being choked, they say its anxiety I have. That and having stomach problems because of stress and constantly worrying about something for over a year.

For a little context, I'm a 20 year old male. Something that should be known about me is that I was frequently sick, at least I think. Besides having asthma as a child, I had moments in my life where I felt like I was dying or experiencing severe health problems. When I was about 8 and 10, same thing when I was 12 and 15 and again now. But it always kind of went away, a lot of people say I might be a hypochondriac and I do believe it. It even applies right now, in my current situation.

I've been to the hospital so many times now that whenever I do feel the same feeling again, instead of rushing out the door to the emergency room, I try my hardest to think of other things to keep my mind preoccupied. It does seem to work, occasionally, but it's something that I rather not experience. Because at the end of the day, every single time, the results come back negative and there's nothing wrong with me--that's what they tell me.

My question is simple, but can finally help me fall asleep at night. I'm so tired, it's been a chore to even sleep now, the feeling of my heart stopping jolts me back awake. My primary doctor is never there, so me going to him is really out of the question. I can't see other doctors there because they, the receptionists and nurses, always say I can't see anyone else but my primary doctor. But he's always busy and I understand that, or he's never there--disappearing for a week or more, just like this past week. I'm really scared and it seems I can't turn to anyone for help.

They barely prescribed medicine for me, after 10 months of feeling unwell, and it's barely working on me. I also stopped going on Google and self-diagnosing myself because it really doesn't help my situation.

Here's my question. How likely is it for a blood test, multiple blood tests actually (more than 4), to come back with an error or mistake on their part? Maybe a mix up or they didn't detect something? I just want some help.

How accurate are blood tests (along with a urine sample and X-Ray) if done multiple times? Is there a chance that something wasn't detected or glossed over? Because even though they tell me my results have come back negative and that everything is normal, it doesn't feel like it.",04Jun2019,2

53,"I have walked across the world, flown to a whole new world multiple times, and I have lost everything. Now before your thoughts take you away from this post because it sounds depressing, just wait...
 
Someone who says they have lost everything really means that the material things they had are gone. The things the valued in their life just gone. When you hear someone say I am losing myself or I have lost everything, say you haven't lost yourself. Suicide rates are so high, believe me when I say I've been there. Sometimes I do very deeply think about what the world would be like if I wasn't here, but at the same time I think deeply about what I can do to show the world I belong here. Not everyone is going to like me, not everyone is going to understand or acknowledge me, and most importantly no one will ever know what I've been through. 

My emotions are sometimes irrational, I am human. My thoughts are dark sometimes, I am human. My physical body might not look too good, I am human. I don't waste time anymore on people who do not value the way I speak, the way I see things, or the way I respect and carry myself. If we learn to practice core values our life's could be better. Compassion is a very important one, Honesty is the one thing that will set you free, and Humility is not a weakness. Stop wearing a mask of pain, shout to the world, ""I am me."" No one can argue with you. Show them facts, put your actions to the test, don't let some person waste your time. You are precious, your time is precious, and You matter.

1. The owner-cum-trainer was worthless. He knew nothing.

3. I constantly tripped over the weights and bars left scattered all around, and hit my head on the equipment.
4. Got quite a few scratches too because the equipment was placed so close together.

The problem is, I loved lifting weights. But I hated that gym. So I quit, and there are no other gyms nearby. I wanted to go for a run in the morning, but it's raining every day now which means the roads are full of mud. I don't even have enough money to buy myself a home gym.

This is taking a huge toll on me. Working out every day in the morning was the perfect way to kick start my day. Now that that's gone, I'm constantly belittling and beating myself up.

But at the day of the concert suddenly all i felt was dread, i didn't want to go and i was scared of the moshpit (eventhough i rationally knew that i could keep myself out of it if i wanted to).

67,"I don’t know who else to talk to about this so let me just tell a story because I need to let this out. Only read if you’re bored cause this will be long and may be uninteresting to some.

When I was 19, I flew to the US to comply with my internship requirements. It was my third trip to the country but I had to stay for about 14 months this time. I was assigned to work in Winter Park Resort up the rockies on the first leg of my internship.

I was heading to the resort to do some paperworks before the opening day when I saw this guy on the bus. For a foreigner like me, who grew up watching a lot of Disney Channel Original Movies, he looks just like your stereotypical heartthrob. Tall, good built, nice hair and dreamy eyes. (I may be biased in describing tho). He got off before the resort so I thought he was just a resident or a random visitor.

By the time the resort opened, I was working as a kitchen helper in one of the in house restaurants. I was so surprised to see him wearing one of the ski resort’s uniforms buying his lunch. I tried my hardest to peak at his name tag but I miserably failed. Despite that, I was so glad to know that the random cute guy I saw on the bus is working in the same place as I do. 

Everyday, I have to ride an employee lift to get to work. He and I must have the same schedule because I always happen to be on the same ride as him. I developed a bad habit of “waiting” for him every morning. When he’s not there, I’ll have this sinking feeling in my chest and have no motivation to go on about my day. 

Through this, I have confirmed to myself that I just had my first crush. I never actually felt anything like that towards another person until I saw him. To be honest, I tried my best to suppress my feelings because I barely know him. And, I consider it an impulsiveness, it’s not a thing that I normally do.

I have a favorite seat on the bus. And every morning he sits directly opposite mine. I was annoyed by this cause I cannot subtly have a glimpse of him when he can obviously catch me doing it. I tried once and he was already staring at me and he had to be the one to look away. 

One morning, the employee bus was packed. A friend of mine is sitting next to my crush few seats away from me. My friend called me and asked me if I was coming to our “Bowling Sundays”. I turned to my friend and caught my crush looking at me and he did not even turned his gaze. I said yes and pretended to sleep cause I was blushing. 

We’re usually off Monday’s so I can stay up late every Sunday. The small movie house in Grand County has a 5 (?) lane bowling alley. Since the day we moved, my friends and I started bowling on Sundays to bond since we work in different departments and different areas.

Sunday comes and the place was packed. And to my surprise, my crush is there with a group of other guys. It was only the second time I saw him in regular clothes. To me, he’s like a model. He dresses nicely in branded clothes. I got so excited with his presence that I actually won our bowling match. No one in my circle of friends knew I had a crush on him except for my roommate who wasn’t there. So they were all surprised that I suddenly became a pro at bowling.

I was assuming that it was just coincidence that he was there at the same time as we were, but him bowling or watching movies with friends every Sunday from then on made me think otherwise.

One afternoon, my roommate excitedly rushed into our room after her shift. She works at another in house restaurant in the resort. She told me that she bears good news. My roommate handed me a small piece of paper. It  was a receipt. I gave her a quizzical look. I was so confused. What am I going to do with this? She told me that my crush went by their restaurant that day and paid on her register using a card. She double printed the receipt so I can finally find out his name. It’s weird, I know and may be illegal but I was so happy.

Let’s just call him Dean. Still weird, but I’m sure I’m not the only one who have done this but I googled him. I found out that he plays lacrosse, volunteer to charities and an active member of their church back in his home state. I was relieved. I thought he’s one of those airy guys who have nothing else in mind than to go by his life with his good looks.

Everyday was like a routine. I’ll be on my favorite seat and he’ll be on my opposite side. He’ll look at me and I’ll look at him and it’s like how we greet each other good morning. When we reach our stop, I’m always the first one to get off and he’ll walk behind me. During lunch, he buys food in our restaurant and I occasionally serve him. And every Sunday we’ll both be in Foundry with our own group of friends. Sometimes we’ll both see each other in random places and (I cannot describe how) acknowledge each one’s presence like “oh hey, you are here.” 

It was my favorite part of my everyday. But I was frustrated with myself. He’s so close but I cannot find the courage to say hi. I even had casual conversation with his group of friends while at the bus stop. One of them even taught me how to snowboard and I had no courage to ask about him. I’ve had arguments with my self that a simple greeting wouldn’t hurt but I was already overthinking about rejection.

March came and something came up back in my home country. I need to go home in a week. And by the time that I can fly again to the U.S, I already need to be in Maine for the second leg of my internship. I was devastated. I was having the time of my life in Colorado.

There was an employee organized dinner coming up. My flight back home is in four days but I can still attend. I gathered all my confidence to finally talk to Dean when I see him at the event. I was on my way with my friends when the bus did not arrive on time. When we finally got there, my roommate told me that she saw him left with his friends with takeouts. I was devastated. The universe conspired against me. That was my last chance to at least introduce myself to him. I wasn’t even expecting anything from it but at least I made a shot. 

I was in tears on my way to Denver. My happiness was cut short but I really had to go home. Timing was really bad. Until now, after months, all I could think about was all the missed opportunities that I had when I was still there. I know this sounds silly and I seem to be putting a lot of importance to tiny details about my everyday life. But to me, that was the moment when I realized that I was capable of feeling something special towards someone afterall. I’ve been so hard on myself prior to that and it was just so relaxing and comforting to be in that situation. I’d love to experience that again and the only thing I will change is that I would like to have more confidence.",04Jun2019,1

72,"Throwaway acc. 

Have you guys ever stopped and thought to yourself that if you were to kill yourself or die today, who would  mourn/care if you did? I think about this at least 3-5 times a week. 

I (mid 20’s M)  use to be social but can be pretty much be categorized as weird/awkward. Most of my friends now have pretty much drifted away because they are busy/settled down now with their SO or hanging with their group of friends. I have  college friends who I use to hang out with who no longer invite me out and only hang out with each other (whenever I ask to hang out, they say are busy). I don’t want to bring it up to them because it just seems like I’m whining to them about the whole situation and that I have to be vulnerable to them in order for them to even notice that I want to hang out with them. It would just be nice to get invited to hang out instead of asking every time because “I forgot to invite” (that’s their excuse).  

I’ve been on dating apps (tinder, bumble, CMB, hinge, POF.... you name it) for over 6 years with no success. Every time I get a match and I try to “be myself” (I like puns, being corny) I either get no response or get a few lines and then ghosted. (I’ve tried the be normal, “hey, how’s it going” route with no success lol). I ask questions and try to get to know the person but just get shut down with a few words/unenthusiastic reply (Example:  Me: so what do you like to do for fun? Her: hike) 
Also I’ve never had a girlfriend before: probably because I’m so socially awkward.

It’s just frustrating that at the end of the day when I look at my efforts to connect with people and try to better my social skills I just end up getting no where. I need a new group of friends to socialize with irl but I just don’t know how to go about it. Go to a bar/club by myself? Yea it’s weird from a social stand point but I literally have no one else to go with and I just want to go and hang out and meet new people whole I can just hang out with. 

TLDR: depressed and lonely cuz I don’t hang out with people anymore and dating self esteem is lower than a delinquents GPA cuz I’m a quarter century old and never dated. Tips on how to make new irl friends?",04Jun2019,1

74,"I live in a really tiny little city in the center of Canada. We just got Uber a few months ago and there are only, like, 3 cars, so I still use one of our original cab services.

Cab drivers are fucking nosey as hell. They ask a lot of weird questions about girlfriends and universities and kids. They're all older people (99% male), most of them from cultures that are totally different from my own, and I never know how they'll react to honesty. The few times I've tried, the rest of the ride is usually pretty awkward (I'm a gay man with a common-law husband and a 12y/o foster daughter, am not in university yet, and am only 23 years old).

So I've started make shit up. Sometimes I have a girlfriend, sometimes she's a French or Spanish or Pakistani immigrant. Sometimes I have an ex-gf who dumped me to fulfill her dreams abroad, being a doctor or going to some fancy art school in London. Sometimes I got married when I was 19 and already have 2 kids and my peers all think I'm going to flunk out of life for growing up too soon. Sometimes I'm going to Law School, sometimes I'm working towards a degree in Arts, sometimes I'm working on a certification in the trades and I'm apprenticing under my dad's best friend. 

Sometimes I work cleaning houses, sometimes I work at a homeless shelter, sometimes I'm a broke-ass waiter just trying to get through college.

For some background - I had a pretty rough time growing up. Always moved every couple years, was the odd one out, perpetually bullied wherever I went. I coped with this by emotionally shutting myself down and escaping the situation... by moving away on my own accord. As a result, I don't really trust anyone in my life, including my partner.

This causes emotional distress for her, and makes me feel like running off the more serious we get. It makes me feel so broken inside - I know I'm damaged goods and am ashamed of it.",04Jun2019,1
76,"I'm 31F and generally a great driver. However, 2 years ago, somewhat out of the blue, I became terrified on driving on motorways. I get the on-set of panic attacks as soon as I join the ramp. I no longer drive on motorways at all - I either click 'avoid motorways' on my Google maps which takes me MUCH longer than it should; or I just don't drive. It's dramatically affecting my life at this stage. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently in therapy for it and working through my issues surrounding it. It's just so odd, how it came out of the blue. I also tried hypnosis which kindaaa worked but not really. I am even feeling panicky just typing about how motorways make me feel. Nuts, I know. 

&amp;#x200B;

My current predicament - I was very kindly offered to rent a vacation home for a week in July - rent free! I really want to go. However, my BF pulled out, and none of my friends are available to come. I really want to go - but it would involve a 1.5hour car journey myself (via motorways) each way to get there. I would be holidaying alone, which comes with it's own... apprehension I guess. But I still want to go. I just can't click 'buy' on the flights as the thought of having to drive on those motorways is crippling me. 

&amp;#x200B;

The offer is for the start of July, so I'll have 4 therapy sessions before then. But I'm just scared its not enough. I don't know what to do. I feel SO STUPID.

79,"Ok here we go.

At the age of 3 my mom and dad got divorced and i have never had a good relationship with my dad, we barely spoke to each other even tho he lived like a 2 minute walk from my mom and me, from the age of 3 to the age of 16 my dad never spoke to me and I never to him, 3 years ago at the age of 16 I was having problems with my mom and I hated life, I just wanted change and I was desperate for it, so desperate in fact that I called my dad and told him I want to move in with him. So me and my dad started talking again and like 2 weeks later I moved in with him
 ( 3-4 years prior me and my mom moved out of the city I grew up in and lived 5 hour away from) (same city my dad lives in). So I moved there and found out my dad was not what I expected him to be, I expected the same dad that didn’t even call me or visit me even tho I was he’s neighbor for 10 years, what I actually got was a dad that did everything for me just to make me happy and show me he was truly sorry he didn’t call me for the past decade and a half. One BIG reason I even reconnected with him was that I was suicidal and absolutely hated my strict and boring life at my moms. 

So my dad let me do everything I wanted and I had no rules at all, It’s been 3 years since I moved in with my dad and my life is absolutely ruined, Let me explain why.

After moving back here I was scared, I met a whole new side of my family I didn’t know I even had, my fathers side of my family didn’t like me at all because I didn’t grow up with them, I was a stranger. I dropped off of school shortly after because of depression and anxiety and I just wanted time to think and settle in at this new life of mine. It’s been 3 years since that decision to drop out of school and I haven’t returned since. I spend my days at home just watching YouTube videos and smoking weed. I have severe social anxiety and depression.

I swear to god I haven’t felt true happiness in over 2 years. 

Everyday is just a fight to not take my own life

I have friends, I have money, I have a girlfriend, I’m pretty good looking, people like me but they have no fucking idea how it feels to be me. I haven’t had ANY responsibilities in 3 years, all i do all day is just sit in my bed watch YouTube and feel sorry for my self. When I do go out I have no regard for my life or safety. I live everyday like it’s my last and I see no future in my life. 

 I’m 175cm tall and weigh 53kg because I barely eat anything anymore. Like 1-2 months ago I tried ecstasy for the first time and I know how dangerous it is and that I weigh only 53kg so I shouldn’t take more then my body can handle, that night I took 1.3 grams of ecstasy and just wanted to die but nothing happened to me 🤷🏻‍♂️ ( my fat ass friend took 200mg and started puking and seeing shit)

Today is me and my girlfriends 5 month anniversary and I haven’t even written to her or called, Because I’m to depressed to do shit. 

I can’t handle anything anymore, Therapy doesn’t work, antidepressants doesn’t work, drugs and narcotics doesn’t work.. I can’t feel happiness.

My dad is going to kick me out soon and I won’t be able to get a job because I’m to anxious and scared of grown up life, I’m scared that I will be homeless because I know I won’t be able to get help, my problems aren’t going away any time soon and I see no solution other then suicide. I’m to lazy to do anything. 

Please god I just want to be able to go out to a restaurant and eat with my gf today but I can’t I just can’t I’m too scared and anxious and depressed and it’s just so hard to explain how I feel. I want to work I want to live a happy life I’m desperate for change in my life and I have no idea where to start.

1 week ago the cops stopped my car and took blood tests and found weed in my system so they took my driving license for 2 years.... 
my car was my everything and now I have nothing. I have no high school degree and I’m turning 19 in 2 months . 

I won’t live to see 19 if I don’t change something drastic in my life right now because I can’t handle life anymore.

I have muchhhh more problems and what I wrote here today just scratches the surface of everything that’s wrong with my life.

81,"So, Im in a bit of a dilemma. Im 29, and for the past 4 months Ive been seeing this girl, we're officially boyfriend and girlfriend. I was in relationships for 9 of my last 10 years, and this one is SO good, it feels too good to be true. We align value-wise, goal wise, sexually, some hobbies, and just basically how we live life. I rarely have to explain myself, and if I do she gets it after 2 minutes. also similar backgrounds, which cannot be underestimated for LTR. With my past GFs i could not really picture a future with them (and one relationship lasted almost 7 years), but that woman is WIFE material, seriously. super fun, caring, smart, pretty, energetic and cheeky. 

&amp;#x200B;

now for the not so cool part. I met her while I was still in my old relationship, that ended in December, and after that ended I just wanted to be single for a while. at least 6 months, so I could figure my stuff out. my now-GF casually asked me 2 months later if i wanted to hang out in a not date-way, but we totally clicked. Just happened, and even though I told her to take it slow, i really wanted her as a GF. 

&amp;#x200B;

for the past few weeks I have been feeling overwhelmed though. this is gonna sound weird: she is great and awesome, but the idea of being in a relationship again stresses me out. Since i was 19 i've been in relationships almost all the time, and though that never bothered me, suddenly I panic. I told her this, we talk very openly and she gives me a looot of space. physically, time-wise and just backing off when needed, she gets my situation. now I have basically two options. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. break up, cause this need to be single and just be alone is too strong (which it feels at times)
2. stay with her and hope this need fades over time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just the thought of breaking up with her feels so wrong, cause i cant lose her, shes the real deal. not many around like her, especially since I have pretty high standards. which sounds ironic but my 3-ish previous gals were pretty cool people. what would you do in my situation?",04Jun2019,2
82,"5 years ago I had a really close friend. We grew apart. She was attractive and had a sociable personality that let her make many friends. I was an introvert on the other hand and very normal. I never tried making too many friends. I was always satisfied having a handful of close friends. But some people just love knowing everyone. When we grew apart I started comparing myself to her and frankly everyone around me. I saw what everyone had and I didn't. I was the smartest kid in the class involved in a lot of different things at school and I also only looked for connection in a few people. I never tried to step out of my comfort zone socially and expand my circle and when I saw people creating social circles like I couldn't, I felt inadequate and kind of jealous. I had everything yet I didn't have anything because I felt mentally confined by my introverted personality that didn't let me have a lot of connections. I felt like I needed everyone to like me and want to be friends with me. That I had to be pretty and fun and basically one of the most likable people in the world. In the process, I really lost myself(But also found a new me to look on the brighter side). My grades suffered because I didn't want to be the best student in the class anymore when everyone was trying their hardest because it was the final year of high school and everyone, just everyone wanted to get the best scores to get into the best colleges. I knew I wasn't going to stand out just by getting the best grades. I realize now it was because I had this incessant need to feel special. It's what motivated me. It's who I was. But this was back when I was 17. I'm 21 now and I know better. I started losing interest in what made me unique and stand out and started focusing on what didn't. Unfortunately, I felt so buried deep under all of my complexes that ""I just couldn't see my light shining"". Few years down the line to now, I can say my insecurities still haunt me sometimes and stop me from making too many friends in college because I know what will happen when I am between these extremely motivated individuals in an alien country who want everything and are driven by similar motives. But after getting diagnosed with schizophrenia and suffering a lack of interest in anything everyday and recovering from it after having a successful semester back from a year long break from college, I really feel like getting back into the game what with my internship this summer. My personality has changes from being a complete introvert to being slightly more extroverted. I think I've been working on communicating my thoughts more to still find the meaningful connections I have always been looking for :) But I want to get back into the game with a different mindset. The need to be unique might motivate me but I really don't want it to bury me anymore. I have slowly developed a perspective that sees uniqueness in a positive way. Uniqueness is in being yourself, not worrying about what anyone thinks of you and in telling your story like it is, even if that means you come off as strange to some. Uniqueness is in forcing yourself to unsee differences and embrace the other as being a reflection of yourself. We are all human beings. Uniqueness is in watching your thoughts and in slowing down to reflect and being a better and more perspective human being when everyone around you is rushing to win the rat race cuz the real treasure lies in being with yourself in the moment doing what you love or finding love in what you do cuz because if you do that, true happiness won't be too far behind. Uniqueness is learning to be yourself with everyone not worrying whether they will accept you or not. Uniqueness is in developing skills that make your connections richer and stronger, not larger. Uniqueness is in being kind and giving. Uniqueness is in learning everyday. Uniqueness is in learning to be a better and a more critical thinker from the patience you developed trying to solve that really hard math problem and not just getting a 4.0 GPA. And lastly, because this is something I'm still struggling with- Uniqueness is in finding the strength to say I will pursue something even if it's not in demand or too popular. Uniqueness is in being true to me no matter what the world thinks.",04Jun2019,1

86,"This past year has been a roller coaster. I got out a terrible relationship with a neglectful partner and lost a ton of weight from all the stress. We broke it off after he ghosted me for a week after I went out to get coffee with another friend. I was called a slut, a whore, a cheater, a bitch, and I honestly didn't care anymore. I was so done with being treated as something that was available only when they thought it was right, so I finally just did something for myself and found happiness somewhere else. 

This upcoming week will be my one year anniversary with my current boyfriend who cares about me like no one has before and encourages me with my college classes and music.

Two months ago I ""broke up"" with my bestfriend of 5 years. She has tried speaking to me on occasion, but I just don't feel like I need to listen to her anymore. This has ruined two other friendships as well, and neither of them seem to care that I am gone. I don't care, obviously they weren't my friends.

I have built 4 strong relationships with the people I now consider my closest friends, and have gotten closer to others who have started inviting me to actually hang out.

I immediately got upset about if and I went to my team leader and assistant manager and refused to take their food to them I wanted them kicked out but my team leader wouldn't coz he said I can't be sure they were making fun of me. later on I had to check the toilets and I walked upstairs to girls toilets and the door opens and it was them girls I looked up and the girl that laughed earlier smiled at me, and I overheard em saying whys a boy going in girls toilets and walked past me as normal.",04Jun2019,1

In fact I think my smarts has always been a little below average, and haven't been talented enough to score anything in life. A little ago while I was studying for another important test I was suffering some severe anxiety and health issues. Getting poor results in that one made me question myself, demotivated. I didn't feel like I could do anything myself. One thing I have learned that for being not very talented the only substitute is working hard.

95,"Last year I met a beautiful girl on a dating site. I found out she was an Au-Pair from Thailand and that she was moving to California for her next family in 3 months. After about a month, her current host family ended up firing her over a survey she wrote to her employer which stated they did not give her enough time off. She ended up staying with me for a few weeks before moving to her next host family in California. 

&amp;#x200B;

She missed me a lot, and I flew her to my city nearly each weekend. About a month after our long distance relationship, we found out she was pregnant. (The reason we got pregnant was because I stupidly thought it was okay to have sex without a condom when she started bleeding after taking Plan B. ) I told her we would get married, and eventually we did. There were a few warning signs that she had a short temper and acted out if she didn't get her way. I wasn't sure if this was due to the pregnancy or her natural self. When we first met, she was completely easy going, but that changed

&amp;#x200B;

The cost for flying her out, the wedding, honeymoon, ring, hospital bills added up. When I met her, I was in about 5k of credit card debt. So far,we are in about 23k in debt (13k credit card, 10k in 401k loan, not including my student loans and car payment) The one plus is that being married and having a child reduced my taxable income and I earn about an additional 900 a month. The credit card debt is transferred to a 0% promo APR and I wanted her to work to help pay it off.  We also ended up moving into a more expensive place. I got my mom to take care of the baby while she works. 

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is that anytime my now wife doesn't get her way or gets stressed out, she takes it out on me. I've gotten so tired of it. Yesterday, she got mad that I paid for groceries with a credit card instead of a debit card. I do it simply because its more secure. She said she didn't want to work just to pay off my debt. I tried explaining to her how I reduced my spending as much as possible, and that most of our debt is due to either her shopping habits, the wedding, baby...etc. She tried arguing with me saying she wanted a divorce, I tried going to sleep as she was pumping her breast milk. I kept ignoring her. She threw her breast milk at me. I got pissed off. I told her lets wait till she gets her greencard and then divorce. She says she just wants to go back to Thailand. Shes begging me to just let her leave and take the baby with her to Thailand. When I woke up this morning, shes begging me to go to the court house with her to get a divorce. She didn't go to work today, not sure if she quit. I tried explaining to her how complicated this situation is and that I still want to be apart of the babies life. I had to leave as there are several critical issues at work I have to assist on before my director leaves.

98,"My(16M) ex(17M) ( broke up about 50 days ago)  left town today. We had been in regular contact after the breakup but I had been hurting so I decided to go no contact. Maybe it was because of the resentment or hatred I had towards her that she didn't care for me as much as I did for her. Felt one sided and hurt.

Today she called me out of the blue to meet one last time. Said she was moving out of town. I went there and met her. Said goodbye, hugged (long one) and she left. Earlier I had resentment towards her and possibly hatred.

The lesson I learnt today was that I let it all go with her. Even though she was oblivious to her mistake, I didn't want to tell her because I didn't want to be the one to hurt her. I don't hurt people. I never have. And someone hurts me, why hurt them back? What makes you different from them. Why spread negativity. I decided to let it all go. Forgive and forget.

I was always the kid with the old man in a young persons body but now I feel completely lost. Over the past year, I've had many realisations most things don't really matter as much as I thought them out to be. I thought getting a bad grade was the end of the world, or not getting a degree would be the end of me, but I realised life is much more than that. However, I have this internal conflict with my new ideas and my old ideas. One side of me is telling myself to do what I want to do, stop taking things so serious and most things aren't a big deal, but then I have this other side telling me the opposite. This is making me feel lost. Especially in regards to a career. I'm only young, so I don't want to screw up, but I have crazy ideas in regards to living alternative none-conventional lifestyles, but again, my inner conflict is telling me to do the normal thing and go to university and get a degree, whereas I'm also telling myself to forget all that and just live free and true to myself.

102,"Having sex with women isn't hard. It really isn't. I mean, seriously. It's not. 

Here's the thing. Guys have the right aim with the wrong target. What I mean by that is...you gotta come across women who love your style. Your flavor. Your brand of swag. You have to supply the demand depending on your location and demographics. Only a few guys are able to sell water to whales and be successful at it. Then you have guys who couldn't get laid to save their lives. 

Real talk. 

For the guys who are struggling to get their jollies off let me tell you this: there's someone for everyone. I repeat. There's someone for everyone. It's up to you to find your target audience that'll appreciate you. And I'm not talking about dating down either. Always remember there are drop dead gorgeous women in every circle on the planet. Whichever demographic you represent, always remember to strive for the cream of the crop. Never settle for less. And most importantly, work on yourself. Hit the gym to get fit. Read books to step your knowledge game up. Work and invest to make sure you have money in your pockets and in the bank. I'm not saying you should get money to blindly spend on a woman. I'm saying that women are attracted to men who are resourceful and self-sufficient.

 Just don't be a dummy with your cash. Make her earn the dough. Just like how women make guys work for the sex. Because guess what? Women are attracted to guys with power the same way men are attracted to women with beauty. First you get the money. Then you get the power. And lastly, you get the ladies. Follow that order, and you'll be straight. Now how you obtain money, power, respect, and the adulation from women is up to you. If you don't grind, you won't shine.

108,"I feel so alone. Yet never lonely enough to relax. I feel so empty but still so full of thoughts. Dark thoughts and dark feelings that shatter my heart in million tiny pieces. I don’t want to feel nor think the way I do but I don’t know how to stop it. I don’t want to resent my partner, my life, myself or my baby but these feelings keep coming back. 
 For a little bit of background: I am a 30 yo F from Europe, been a model since turning 18 until I got pregnant. I was always able to support myself from my modeling jobs and had an above medium lifestyle. That obviously ended and now I depend financially on my partner. It’s so hard and I feel so useless, helpless and vulnerable. The pregnancy brought me so close  dying that it’s a miracle I can write this. I had major complications, been on steroids treatment for a year and gained 20 kg. I know it might sound very superficial but it hurts so badly looking in the mirror and not recognizing myself. It’s a huge hit on my confidence since I’ve spent 28 years always being the best looking one when I’ve entered a room. Judge me for thinking like that but it is what I feel. Recently the doctors told me I might had an autoimmune disease and I am still waiting for my results to come back. Since becoming pregnant my body is a wreck, I am a wreck and my relationship is falling apart. I have 0 friends and my family situation isn’t a happy one either. My mother has Parkinson’s and she is turning into a different person each day so it’s getting harder for me to get along with her. We’ve never been close but it gets impossible now to get along well. I’ve lost all my passions and any interest in anything, I don’t enjoy doing any of the things I used to love. I just wake up every day just to go back to sleep.
 I miss my old self, my old life, I miss being social and passionate about so many things. I miss waking up and feeling greatfull for being alive, for always being in love with myself, with life and everybody else.
I am drained, none of those feelings exist in me anymore and I miss them so much. All I can feel these days is exhaustion, anger, frustration. I hate the way I feel and look. I’ve had bad moments in my life before but there was always a way out, always something or someone pulling me back to reality. 
This time, although I have a partner and a 1yo baby, nothing seems to work. He is so absent, never listening and when he does, he can’t understand how I feel. My baby girl...instead of feeling joy when I look at her I just feel convinced she would be better off without me. I love her with all my heart and I would do anything for her. Sometimes I think that’s why I want a better mother for her than myself. She and her father seem so natural and happy together while I force myself to get out of bed each day. There is no energy left in me to play or sing to her.  Nothing...When we are alone I can only take care of her basic needs (cleaning, feeding,sleeping). 
Today I couldn’t speak at all, I had no energy to speak and my mind was busy with all these dark thoughts. I kept wondering if anyone would miss me and I am guessing not. 
I am turning more and more towards myself and my thoughts and I mean that in a bad way. I am screaming for help and no one can hear me. Literally, I’ve told my partner that  I truly want to die and he said he is to tired to listen to me. I’ve insisted, told him he won’t feel tired when he will find me dead but I got no reply. 
I know it’s no one else’s business and responsibility but I truly need someone else to save me from myself this time. I can’t do this alone, I am not strong enough. Not today at least",04Jun2019,2

So I relatively recently started skateboarding as just something fun at first I was loving every minute. Now 6 months or so in I've made very rapid good progress. The problem is at the skate park there are a few young people 11 through to 13, they are better than me one of them in particular is sponsored and competing at a national level. I just feel so inferior and worthless whenever I see them or hear about there achievements and I feel I cant say anything cause people will think I'm stupid for thinking like that. I cant help thinking like this and its ruining the sport I loved. This turmoil in my head has also made me perform worse due to the lack of confidence which then feeds into itself.

117,"I apologize beforehand if the title is misleading just know, no one died if that's what you thought.

I knew this guy since 7th grade we are now seniors, and as years went on we would become best friends. We both had a good understanding of eachother and would listen to one another. There was one time we both liked the same girl but both talked it out together, reasoned it, and addressed that whatever happens, no harm would be done to our friendship.

Recently, when I tried to talk to him he would ignore me and not listen to whatever I said. I knew something was wrong, but I wasn't exactly sure what it was. After a long time, I finally got what he was holding up inside. He told me I had always pushed my ideas down his throat and never gave him any chance to prove his point and also said I strive to be the best to the point where I push others down. Another thing is that he said I flex all the time whether its about grades, videogames, etc. After all of this I found out he would talk trash about me about all these things with others and never addressed it to me.

In my point of view, I definitely felt really bad. I definitely agree with him that I've forced my ideas onto him, however, he was the type of person who would want to get better at certain things himself such as getting good at a game but would never put time to do it. So I had often tried to help him by showing him how to do certain things. It seems like it may have grown to the point it affected other more serious situations that he said I didn't accept the fact I was wrong. I was really confused about how I pushed others down. To let you guys know, I'm the type of person who is all about self improvement and working on yourself and obtaining your goals in whatever you cared about. I would always want to be better at what I enjoyed and wanted to do which would happen naturally as I continued to spend time on whatever it was. But never once have I felt I had pushed someone down in order for me to obtain something higher because I would often help others and show them how to do things if they didn't understand. The only thing I could think of that would cause him to feel like I push others down is I guess I might've done something or said something that I don't really remember that made him feel lower than he actually was, but I don't really know, because I truly believe he is his own amazing individual. Lastly, flexing or showing off, I didn't realize this was a big problem nor if I actually do it a lot. I've become more conscious when I do it because he said I constantly do it, saying I would like brag about my grades without studying but I would only really do it for 1 class because able to get away with not paying attention in that class, try to study the night before a test, and get a good grade cause of a huge curve the teacher would give us. I mainly felt proud about that class because it felt I could put minimal effort but still get saved with a really good grade from the amazing teacher and in reality I didn't care much about it. In short, I didn't care much about my grades however I would still put in effort to get good ones. Additionally, others often bragged about their grades more than me.

Altogether, I feel really bad about all of it as a whole it has made me think I'm a horrible person. My other friends tell me to not think much about it and that im not everything he said about me. However, know I still acknowledge that I pushed my ideas on to him. I also know myself I have done questionable things such as supporting another guy who I'll call as Guy A for liking the girl previously mentioned me and my friendhad both liked, but I supported him because Guy A was also a good friend and that his relationship with her was going well while my old best friend's was going downhill.

123,"I'm usually pretty bored and dour person in general. But today I am happy and excited because I just got a small carry-cooler for work.

But what makes me really happy is I get to do something I REALLY enjoy. I get to organize all the stuff I bring to work inside the cooler. 

Note: a very small section of the cooler will be devoted to actual food (usually a sandwich, chips,  can of ginger ale, 6 small cookies and metal insulated drinking container filled with ice). The rest of the space is devoted to allllllllllllllllll my goof-off gear. I have a LOT of unsupervised downtime in my job and need activities to fill it. 

Stuff like a netbook (for internet browsing), a large tablet for movie watching, a 7 inch screen TV for TV watching, Misc accessories (cables, power plugs etc etc). 

Then there are the warning devices I utilize in case a supervisor comes to check up on me. I use a Driveway alert that includes a base station and a sensor I set out on the driveway that alerts me to when a vehicle is coming. And a backup device I use on the building's doorway that is basically one of those doorway alert that a lot of shops use to alert them to when a customer comes in. Basically a more limited version of the driveway alert. 

Anyway I now get to have fun organizing it all in the cooler  in THE most optimized way. Which should take quite some time, but.... I absolutely LOVE doing it. I have not been this happy/excited in a long long time. I DE-LIGHT in doing this. 

The previous hand-carry cooler couldnt hold all the stuff I used and it was a constant pain. My food would get a little crushed in the process of packing it all in. And it became a chore packing and unpacking it all 4 times a day. 

I've already done preliminary organizing just to make sure everything fits and it does with a little room to spare. 

#One thing I'd like to do is build an organizer insert made out of a sturdy lightweight material so everything has its place inside the cooler. So none of it moves around. So if any DIYers know of anything material that is relatively lightweight and sturdy I could use to build the organizer ... I'd appreciate it. :D",04Jun2019,5

My wife and I didn't want human children but, to us, our cats are like our children. All three are special needs cats.

126,"Its subtle, but to hear them talk they tend towards sexist ideals. Especially in terms of the media they consume, they're into anime with too much female sexualisation or they complain about females taking over movies and the like.

Whenever I challenge them on it they seem to not know that much about gender in society, they say I sound like an sjw or they just ignore it altogether and clam up. They seem really oblivious of the social sciences in general; whenever I press them on ""gender dysphoria"" or ""microagressions"" they freeze up.

This is a rant but they keep spamming sexist talking points and referring to ""sjws""  or ""the gays"" and seem like they don't have any facts behind their arguments. They say that women ought to dress a bit more conservatively at university and gawk at them when they walk past.
