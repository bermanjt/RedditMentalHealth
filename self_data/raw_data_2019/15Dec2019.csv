1,"I have no idea why people continually underestimate them.  


I have no idea...why I want to fly into a goddamn rage every time I hear about them.  


I have no idea why I hate them with every fiber of my being and I want them dead to the last man,woman and child(they pretty much would do the same to us.)  


I have no idea why I'm so scared of these guys..  


But,all I know is that these guys are gonna be the reason why I try the military again(namely the air force).  


As I type...I legit feel terror...North Korea scares the everliving fuck outta me,I mean,they're batshit insane ffs.  


And the thing is...I don't even know where this shit even came from...I keep thinking that THEY are the reason I don't want(or more likely CAN'T) go to Japan...but now I guess dying in Japan wouldn't be such a bad thing.  


All I know is that I am more scared of North Korea than I am of the bloody grim reaper.  


I almost *died* (Had a small heart attack because they were mentioned once) because of them,and they kinda made my life a living hell(because my brain,because of them,became a bigger asshole than Donald fucking Trump..among other things),the shrinks I see can't really help me with this,and I'm of the notion that being afraid of North Korea is punishable by death(what with all the cyber-bulling/trolling i've been subjected to).  


And I am bloody fucking scared of Koreans. **Real talk.**  


I just had no idea that North Korea was nothing much to worry about...I mean,I guess the guys on fucking fox news/MSNBC/CNN other mass media didn't get that memo,because as far as they're concerned,Kim Jong Un may as well be thanos.  


And THAT is a huge reason why I feel that towards North Korea:They just portray them as being these unstoppable war gods/supermen/ubermensch because of the goddamn nukes..and they can end the damn world too(being backed by China does not help.)  


North Korea:The stuff of my nightmares,a pain in my ass,the reason why Japan is a bad fucking idea(was,anyway) and the thing that evidently NO shrink can help me with and if you're afraid of them? prepare to die.  


I mean,if worst comes to worst,Death by North Korean,anyone?  


For me a black man,that shit is gonna be like being killed by the damned KKK. They hate black people,you see(then again,the whole damn world does..look no further than the fact that we have Trump as president)  


Is it any wonder why I contemplated suicide on more than one occasion? Suicide solves nothing,but the chances of you dying to some bullshit(including to crazy dictators like Kim Jong Un) are pretty fucking high.  


And it's utterly unbelievable...Who knew Koreans would end up getting you dead? in the old days,all we had to worry about was the Russians/Al-qaida/ISIS...now it's Asians(Chinese and or Koreans) that are gonna murder us...  


I really do wonder if they hate the west...I really do wonder if they really hate Americans.

My backstory is that I was raised in a cult-like religious (Jehovah’s Witness) and was homeschooled from 3rd grade until graduation. Life feels meaningless.

There’s a lot going on in my life. I have so much fear. I have so much anxiety. I have so much confusion. I don’t know how to cope with it but I do... I don’t feel the same anymore and I miss the stability I once had. I’m a lot angrier nowadays &amp; I don’t blame it on the drinking at all. I drink for relief. I drink for better relaxation. I need a break. I need some peace. I know it’s not healthy. I don’t even think it makes me a drunk to just to go for a good buzz. Something to take the edge off. Maybe when I didn’t/couldn’t stop that one week but besides that...

I wish I didn’t have to feel the need to do this. I wish I weren’t so anxious. I feel burnt out by life &amp; people. I feel I’m losing my self-worth. I don’t feel enough right now. Drinking doesn’t fix that... but at least I don’t care for a little while...",15Dec2019,1

I’m a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it so idk. Also when I only got a pub job myself without asking for her help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way .  When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I Looked to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley quiet way which confuses me because she gave me a furrowed eyebrows snobby look at me when she first called me over to the appointment which got me down


Edit: she started saying the ‘awww’when I’d get up to leave after I failed an interview for not having enough confidence but I usually would say ‘oh ok thank you’ is maybe why?",15Dec2019,1
23,"I was chubby as a child and when I got to my pre-teens and teen years, I’ve naturally become more conscious of my appearance and have been able to maintain an average weight. Up until 2015-2016 when I went through a tough time and I ballooned up and everybody thought I would never get my old size back. But since then I’ve been progressively losing weight. Watched what I ate, exercised, etc. But now I’ve reached a point where I’m underweight and I’m having a hard time gaining, and I’ve seem to lost my appetite and usually I do love eating though. It’s just funny how I never thought I’d have the problem of having to gain. This should be the dream to be able to eat whatever, and yet I’m not making full use of it",15Dec2019,1
24,"I think I just honestly hate interacting with people. I've spent the majority of my life being extremely sad and depressed because I don't have any friends, and it seems like no matter what I do I can't reach out to people. I have a second Instagram account where I frequently post more personal things that frequently have to do with me being depressed. It's pretty frequent that I'll have people message me things akin to ""Hey are you okay? I'm here if you need to talk. Message me whenever"" so on and so forth things of that nature. I usually respond a little bit. We talk for a while. Conversation ends within a few hours at maximum.

However, I  never actually take anyone up on their offer of talking when I'm feeling sad, and I never really understood why. For a long time, I thought that I had some form of undiagnosed autism, or mental disorder that just made it impossible to interact with people (I still think that I may have something undiagnosed, and I'm trying to get it checked out with my therapist; but idk.)

However, I actually got a girlfriend for the first time a month ago, and I've been talking with her whenever I feel sad. It's the greatest thing ever. I look forward to talking with her, and I think the only difference is that she's my girlfriend. I don't find myself being sad when I see social media posts where there are people in groups. I thought for the longest time that I got sad because I didn't have any friends. Yet, I can only recall getting sad when there was a woman that I was attracted to in the social media post, and I wasn't spending time with her. So I think that the thing that I really seek instead of friendship is a romantic relationship. Looking back at my past and what I imagine my future is, I think that I could honestly spend the rest of my life without any friends. However, I don't think I could live without a significant other in my life. I hear these stories about men who are together with their wives for like 60 years. Then, their wife dies, and then, they die within a month. I can totally see that being me.

Even if this woman isn't the woman I spend the rest of my life with, I'm very certain that the only way for me to be happy in life is with some loving relationship with a woman.",15Dec2019,1

27,"I’m 26, and a generally likeable person and a college student at a great school. I have friends, I have family who loves me- the reasons why I’m stuck suffering. 
I just can’t find the reason to be alive other than the guilt of knowing how my death would cause others, especially my family, to suffer. If I could ever silence that guilt I know I would do it. 
People argue reasons to be alive- “you have worth because you were born”, “go eat a pizza on Italy or travel and experience something new”, etc etc. 
But that’s simply not true. Anything that brings joy is temporary. Sure I could go travel but first I have to have money. And if I had that money I would use it to pay bills or go see my grandmother. I’m stuck in “the machine”, working to survive while I still can’t afford to properly take care of my health. I live in a world being overtaken by intrusive technology, we don’t even have the option to eat healthy and clean food (organic is a joke for those of you fooled). This is a world of hate, and the small acts of kindness are like a pacifier to temporarily soothe. 
I’m overwhelmed my thoughts of the painful events I’ve experienced in my life, and they are always greater than the the good I’ve experienced. People say it will get better but if 21 of 26 of my years so far have been had more pain than happiness, why should I expect things to turn around? I’ll be more in debt when I finish school, I’ll be experiencing more health problems with age, and I’ll be stuck working my life away just to not die.

28,"I've gone numb and just want to get it all out. 6 months ago I broke up with my boyfriend of almost 2 years, he was my first real relationship but I ended up feeling differently towards the end, I loved him but I didn't at the same time. He caught on and eventually asked me if I still wanted to be with him, it was a calm breakup but I didn't even cry, looking at him made me sad of course but I couldn't bring myself to tears and I felt heartless. I ""moved"" on fast, did some hookups off tinder and realized that wasn't me and I wanted a relationship again. I began dating a guy I met off tinder a month or so later and even though I was happy for the most part, I couldn't imagine myself being in love or fully committed. He told me he loved me after a couple weeks which was insane of him, I said it back. Big mistake on my half because I didn't have the capability to love him at that time, and physical intimacy was nothing to me. I broke up with him after a little more than a month, I did it over snapchat with the help of a friend. I know, brutal. But I didn't care, I keep having this motto in my head that as long as I'm happy it's okay. But I'm never really happy anymore anyways. I slept with his best friend, and explicitly told him I did not want a relationship, which he didn't understand so I broke it off with him aswell. Throughout all of this I've had a guy friend who I was never sure what my feelings exactly were towards him, I recently discovered alterous attraction and realized that described it the best. Apparently he feels this same way, and even though I would date him I still feel nothing. I'm in this state of being okay with anything, I don't care what happens or what I do, I can't make decisions for myself even though it's ruining these relationships I can't stand being alone. I do struggle with depression and it was my first relationship that helped me out of that hole. I know I should learn to deal with this on my own, I shouldn't have to be in a relationship all the time, but I want to be because I feel like I need someone there or else I have nothing to look forward to. I don't do anything with myself besides work, no hobbies or activities besides seeing friends. I guess I just want to know if its okay that I need someone. If its okay that I cant be alone, even though I'm so gone at this point and love is out of the question. Would that be using someone?

35,"Title says most of it.  

I’m a high school senior and I want to study music technology and sound design in college because electronic music is my passion.  It has been since I was about 10.

Both my parents went to college.  My mom went to a tiny liberal arts school in upstate New York that cost her almost everything she had for very little in return and my dad went to a commuter school in the Bronx which cost him diddly shit and has recently helped net him a huge executive job at a multinational company, the money from which he’s going to use to buy his dream house in the next city over.

My first choice college has already accepted me, and honestly I’d be happy to just accept their offer now.  It’s a major state school in the Southern US that has something of a reputation for being a party school, but it also has incredible academics and comparable programs in my field to any other program in the nation.  It’s also pretty damn economic for being so well-known.  I could get through four years with no debt.  My dad doesn’t give much of a damn where I go, he just wants me to be happy and get a job I can love someday.  

My mom is different.

My mom loathes everything about the South, it’s taken six months to even get her to agree to visit the school at some point, and her top choices for me are huge private universities in my hometown and in New York that aren’t a good fit for me at all and make you work yourself to the bone just to have a CHANCE at getting in.  Not to mention the fact that I’d have to sell a kidney or beg money off my dad to pay for it without getting into loan debt.  It’s all about image to her and I can’t get her to see that her biases and unrealistic expectations are crushing me.  And did I mention that my state’s healthcare system sucks and can’t get me my anxiety/depression meds on time at ALL, so I have to go weeks without them sometimes?

My depression and anxiety were at an all time high and honestly seeing the faces of those kindergarteners scrolling across the CNN screen made me feel absolutely convinced that with evil in the world that terrible and my life being as bad as it was, that there was no point in living anymore.

I sat there that night with my loaded shotgun on my lap and even put it in my mouth but couldn’t muster the wherewithal to pull the trigger.

Since then I’ve fought my depression tooth and nail. I’ve gotten help, been in a lot of pain and experienced a lot of joy. It almost feels alien to think about how I felt back then. I’m so happy for every day and the life I’m living couldn’t honestly be better.

I realized the problem several days ago when I was wanking towards a Russian girl on Pornhub. In the video, she didn't talk to much, but moans regularly - two 'aha' followed one 'o'. The sound aroused me. And her appearance - after the wanking, it struck me that she looked just like my ex.

That settled it. My sex wondering object is my ex, how pathetic (highlight: I asked for breaking up). If I wank towards the Russian girl over and over again, this kind of dependence will definitely be enhanced. But f\*\*k, I enjoyed the experience.

I was horrified, so I scrutinized my past life.

I took up wanking 2 or 3 years ago. Reviewing my life changes, I'm shocked at the profound change of my outlook on beauty and girls. My ex and e-ex drew great appeal to me merely for their appearance. They are good-looking, dependent on family, short-sighted and seriously hurt by me - because in the end, it was always I that abandoned them. The flaws in my characteristics resulted in the sad consequence, but that's not what I'm going to talk about. Maybe I'll mention it in another post.

The problem is that I can't treat beautiful girls as persons but as objects. When meeting a girl, the only thing in my mind is whether she's beautiful. If the answer is positive, I will start fantasizing.

Why is it like this? Am I just desperate for affection? I don’t know honestly. It’s not like I’d just take up the first person that likes me, I just want to find someone who won’t hurt me. I’m tired of being hurt and I’m tired of comforting and reassuring people and then not being comforted or reassured back. It’s my own fault, I know. I just don’t know how to find someone that doesn’t lose interest after a while, I feel like everyone gets bored of me after some time.

I have friends and I’ve been talking to them and they’ve been there for me, it’s helped but I still feel this loneliness because I trusted him with things I never told anyone else, and now he’s gone and I feel cheated in a way. I feel used. I know he never meant me harm, he cared for me, but he just didn’t seem to care about my feelings half the time. Sometimes he did, and other times he ignored me. Being ignored for a week hurts. I felt like I was a burden, annoying, selfish for even just asking when the next time we could call would be. I know that’s all my fault, that I put those emotions there in the first place, but this isn’t the first time this has happened to me and it really hurt me. Maybe I’m selfish for just wanting to spend some time with someone for one day out of the week. I don’t know.

I just wish someone who understood me and my issues would magically appear and be that person that I feel like I need in my life to feel whole. I’m not saying I need a partner to survive, I just feel like I’ll never be fully content if I don’t have someone by my side to fill in those lost years of love and affection with new years I can look forward to and work towards. It’s almost Christmas and now I’m going to be spending another year crying over losing not only my partner but my best friend. I just want someone who I can trust the way I trusted him. I just want to be loved and love back even if that means I’m now a desperate person lmao. That’s just how I feel.",15Dec2019,1

  I go out and do things and I don’t know why but I decided that I’d rather sleep on the floor then clear off my bed. I put down a thick blanket, a pillow, put a blanket on me and went to sleep. I have continued to sleep on the floor every single  night since instead of just cleaning up my bed. 

  The floor isn’t awful but it’s definitely reduced my quality of sleep making me tired and grumpy these past few weeks. It’s just so damn ridiculous. Like it would take 2 fucking minutes just to move the stuff and have a great nights sleep and very single night I look at it and I’m like “nah, I just don’t wanna” and then sleep on the floor. Like my jeez why can’t I just do it? I write this at 1:48 am still lying on the fucking floor because for some reason I won’t just move the stuff on my bed. I literally have no excuse.

I’ve been depressed all my life, always just hiding it from friends and family, always putting up a facade, and always just trying to keep my different identities in order. Even though my support me financially, they’ve never really been there emotionally at all, and my dad was pretty abusive growing up now that I think of it, but I don’t really know what’s normal. My mom has always just betrayed my trust and been so intrusive and nosy, that I’ve never been able to trust her really and I’ve just have started noticing that I’m finding myself wanting to distance myself from my family.

Take counselling and therapy - you're trying to identify and get to the bottom of an issue that's causing someone distress or other symptoms, work out and test methods that will help someone to process the issue, and hopefully the patient comes out feeling better, or at least better-equipped to deal with their problems. The efficacy of it depends on the skill of the counsellor in identifying the issue and potential ways to move forward, the depth of the issue, and the patient's mindset, so it's a different ballpark, but the same rational process at play. Our thoughts and feelings aren't precise or measurable in the scientific way, but we can address them using the same rational approach.

63,"""OK so why the hell is this guy posting this here?""

I'm sure this is a question most, if not all of you are asking yourselves. Well... after watching this video I began to realize that even though it involves the real life ""girlfriend"" of late superstar Whitney Houston and their own unique friendship and intimate romance, there is a bigger lesson in Robyn Crawford's story for all to share be they female or male. It's called ""life, friendship and love."" Robyn Crawford's story represents the secrets that are sometimes part of certain intimate dynamics involved with a friendship that impact our lives whether we choose to reveal them or not. Now I don't know if Robyn did her book for the money or not, and I really don't care because if I had to guess... it was for more than money alone. It's her story. It's her desire to step out of the shadows of rumor, innuendo and second-hand information to present the friendship, love, relationship and yes... the drama... that she shared with Whitney Houston and being a key part of her life. I think I get it. This is why I honestly believe there is both a story and a lesson here for all to share.

Everyone has a personal life. Most, if not all of us have secrets... secrets that depending on who we are; where we live and other complexities involved with our lives may or may not allow us to discuss these secrets with other people. It could be something as simple as a secret crush on a straight or gay friend or an actual love connection, and this is something that can that transcend age, race or even gender. In watching this interview, I began to realize this is about love... the kind of love that many people don't understand or accept... and it's OK.... it's OK because there are millions of people out there who DO understand and accept it for whatever it is be it within themselves or others.

Check this out: Many of you guys have different definitions of the term bromance, and many of you choose to use this term because it is not as revealing as the terms bi or gay. Well that's OK too. No one really NEEDS to know your personal business except that special girl or guy. Just know that even though this subreddit is called ""Bromance"", this story is bigger than any one gender because it represents love, friendship and situations that happen everyday whether guys talk about it or not... and many will choose not to do so, but the feelings remain, and despite your best efforts to conceal them... they do, in fact, tell the story. You need to understand these things as a man, a person and an individual.

Here's the video, and feel free to check it out for yourselves:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJak-1u9l4s&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJak-1u9l4s&amp;feature=youtu.be)",15Dec2019,1
64,"I used to be a super happy kid. I had friends, good grades and a happy relationship with both my parents. I used to live in Portugal before I moved to Boston when I was 11. I think that’s when it all started going downhill. It was an extremely slow process. 

When I first moved, I didn’t worry about much. Of course, I was scared not knowing how to speak english and being in a whole new country with people I didn’t know a single thing about. But still, I was able to make friends pretty easily in a month or two. By the end of November, two months after I moved. I was already having sleepovers and considered myself known around the school. However, I started getting bullied. Not the kind that you know bullying. My friends started making fun of me and slowly turned from a little bit to a lot. I couldn’t really complain because they would just say that it’s a joke and i’m too sensitive but me being an 11 year old boy, I started to drift from that fiend group. 

I was in a very small school so by then end of April, everyone knew that I was getting bullied. Some of my closest friends from other grades started to believe the rumors and i started to get very lonely. i didn’t get help until January the next year. I also didn’t tell anyone, someone complained for me without me knowing. The two main people who were bullying we’re threatened to be expelled and they stopped annoying me. I was kinda happy again but definitely a lot of more self conscious. Then I had to find new friends in this small school and eventually I did. When middle school ended, people had forgotten about it and so did I and even became really close friends with one of the kids who bullied me. 

Than I told my mom I wanted to change schools for highs cool (i was happy in that school but it still a horrible school with a lot of fake people). and so I did. I changed to a very big school with 600 kids in my grade. No one really bullied anyone coz it’s high school and I made friends really quickly since I was able to find a group of people. I joined the freshman play and made my two best friends in there. We didn’t really like plays but we considered ourselves pretty good actors and we liked the attention I guess. Those two friends were really popular and they introduced me to all their friends. I also became very popular which to be honest I kind of regret. I didn’t know how people acted with other people and I didn’t past ‘drama’ that people had so I just assumed everyone was nice

Then my 2nd quartet grades came out and I only had Cs and 1 B-. My dad is incredibly strict and freaked out. My family is really good and I love them but My older sister who’s now 19 was incredibly problematic and our house had some pretty rough arguments, I’ve always thought my parents don’t love each other and they’re only together because they want to stay here in America to give a better life. Portugal is an amazing country but the education isn’t very good We still go to Portugal every christmas and Summer coz we love it there and our whole family is there. 

Anyways after grades came out, My relationship with my dad started going downhill. I was already starting to get social anxiety and depression from my middle school but now it really started to hit me hard. By the end of freshman year, I had stopped hanging out with most of my friends because of pure anxiety and me thinking everyone hated me so I slowly backed away.

I’m a sophomore now and my grades are ok. I dropped from Advanced Math to Honors and I had three As and 2 Bs in first quarter. That still wasn’t good enough in my dads eyes. he calls me some bad things and acts irrationally coz he doesn’t really know how to talk to us. Our mom always supports us and there’s at least one argument a day. Still we are a holy family and we sometimes go out for lunch as a family, watch movies. Just occasional arguments here and there. 

Everything changed last week though. My dad found out my older brother smokes weed. That was a shit show, coz my dad thinks weed is as bad as cocaine. It was a horrible day and he put all his anger on all of us. He woke me up at 7:30 the next day to shovel the snow and he would just scream at everything I did. I couldn’t handle it anymore and finally confronted him and told him he’s being really fucking mean. He felt really bad after and left to go have a coffee. I went to my friends house at 8:30 and stayed there until 1. I had this constant headache that really hurt. I took advil and it would leave for a little but it would came back hours later. This lasted all week and I was incredibly tired at school. 

My mom realized i needed help, being a therapist and got me someone. I’m meeting a therapist when I get back from Portugal! I’m finally getting the help I need. I have one more week of school and then I get to have a nice vacation in Portugal too. I’m still friends with two people I met in the play but we aren’t as close coz of anxiety and the fact that they’re still popular and I kind of drifted away.

TL;DR: I slowly started having anxiety and depression from middle school but it got a lot worse in high school. Finally told my mom I wanted to see someone!",15Dec2019,1

You may think of this as an odd question, but we had already talked for a little bit and he was quite comfortable with the fact that he wouldn't live much longer, he had gracefully accepted it. His answer wasn't what most of us would think of, but it was what all of us should strive for. He answered ""Everything I ever wanted to."" I smiled at him and said, ""then you truly are ready to die, and I hope to say the same thing on my death bed.""

71,"I’m not married. I’m not even dating anyone. I’m probably never going to marry or date anyone again. That being said, it’s on my mind a lot both because a lot of my friends are starting to get married and because whenever I see my family, I’m bombarded with questions about why I’m still single and how easy it is to settle down.

I have never witnessed a positive romantic relationship between two people in my entire life. Not once. Every relationship I have witnessed and every relationship I have been in have been immensely toxic. It genuinely seems like human beings aren’t capable of being together without turning on each other, at least from my tiny perspective of the world. The people I know currently in relationships are just vicious to each other (but nice to me). I’ve seen plenty of relationships be loving when they first begin and then they get bored and all the backstabbing begins. That’s essentially what happened with my last relationship and how I was treated so I’m definitely smarting from that.

Not to mention that 1/2 of all marriages end in divorce, which just sounds like insanity that anyone would enter into. That’s a coin toss’ chance that it’ll end badly. And out of the people who stay married, there’s the percentage like my parents who only stay because they think divorce is a sin despite despising each other.

Why would anyone embark on anything with horrible odds like that? I keep seeing friends getting married and keep thinking “in ten years you’ll all be separated.” Hell, a few marriages have begun and ended already in the time that this trend started in my life.

I’m not saying it’s impossible to have a good marriage where the two people somehow don’t get bored of each other, but it’s a much smaller percentage than those who stay married and hate each other and those that leave each other. Willing to be challenged on this because I’m not much of a researcher and I’ve only got that one damning statistic to go off of. 

Honestly I’d go so far as to say that romantic love doesn’t exist and we can only entertain each other romantically so long as we want to screw each other. Friendships seem much easier to maintain without all the backstabbing and the petty drama. Of course, there’s no way I could prove or disprove that, I think it just stems from an inherent belief that all human beings are selfish at their core.",15Dec2019,1

79,"I saw Louis Rossmann’s video on YouTube recently regarding procrastination and how to put an end to it. And by god, he had some seriously solid advice on controlling it. 

He said that procrastination is essentially a form of defiance towards oppression. The oppression in question being people who tell us what to do. Our parents, teachers, society, etc. Yeah yeah I know “We live in a society lol”, but he honestly had a great point. People who tell us to do something that we don’t want to do on the grounds that we “have to” like for example: going to college, finding a job that pays well but isn’t something we’re interested in, or even something as simple as cleaning our room; If someone tells us to do those things because “we have to”, we seem to automatically become less inclined to do it, and as a form of rebellion or defiance, we end up doing it... but at our own pace. Or we do something we are interested in first and put off that task someone tells us to focus on for later. 

We even procrastinate against things that we ourselves say that we need to do, because that way of thinking becomes hardwired into us essentially. So to counteract that mentality, what Louis said he ended up doing was practicing exercises that helped him convince himself that he was his own man, that he was free. Sure, he COULD go to work today, he COULD go to school, but he doesn’t have to.  He might suffer consequences for doing so, but he still doesn’t have to because he is a free man. He would do this by sitting at his chair, and pondering on these thoughts, and telling himself that sure, if he doesn’t go to work he’s not gonna get paid, he may even lose his job. But he still doesn’t have to; he could sit at his chair all day if he wanted to, because he is a free man. Simple shit like that.

As a result, it became much easier for him to focus on the things he wanted to do, and procrastination became less of an obstacle. He got himself a better job that way, and even helped his business grow with his newfound line of thinking. As my interest in this radical way of thinking myself, I decided to try it. Sure enough, I got off my ass today after struggling to get to sleep, and I took a shower, then went out and got myself coffee, and breakfast. Something I never would’ve otherwise done before. Additionally, I’m also planning to start doing what I want to do, and get back into writing, instead of talking about wanting to get back into it.

I’m gonna try my hand at starting a blog. I want to sharpen my writing skills, and eventually start writing scripts for movies, TV, or whatever the hell I want to create, because I am a free fucking man. As are each and every one of you. Once you convince yourself that you are, all these doors are gonna unlock, and if you have a passion for something, if you have even just a small wick of flame for desire to do what you want to do, then I highly suggest trying what I did. I’ve never felt so motivated in my life, and I hope the same happens for anyone who wants to improve their life in a genuinely impactful way. Because we are all free men and women and whatever you want to be, and once your mind is in sync with that knowledge, then we should all be capable of pursuing our purpose in this scary ass world.

At least, I hope that’s how it goes. Anyways thank you for listening to my all over the place Ted Talk lol. Hopefully I was able to say something insightful, because I sorta need to be able to do that in the road I’m about to walk down.",15Dec2019,1

81,"So I work a 9 - 5 which takes up the majority of my time in the week as it does for most people, and I do enjoy it so I don't mind that too much. I still have a part time job that I had before starting my 9 - 5 and I put in around 10/15 hours there on a weekend, and I often work more hours than scheduled in the week so I average somewhere around 55 hours working per week. I often long for a day off where I can relax and not do anything, but today has been one of these rare days, and for some reason I always find myself ending up in a bad mood at then end of them.

I've always liked to keep myself busy, and that's why I still work my other job at weekends - it's not really about the money, rather just having something to do. Whenever I have downtime, I distract myself for a little while with a game, reddit and YouTube, but after a few hours of these combined I get bored and want to do something else, and at this point my mood just begins to sink. I don't know what it is about me, but I just don't enjoy being idle and passive, and it feels like I'm wasting my time away and this causes the bad mood. I don't have any hobbies or real interests, and I can be sociable but I like my own space, so I'm lost as to what to spend my time on when I have some free.

Does anyone relate? If so, how do you try to overcome it?",15Dec2019,1

83,"It started the beginning of November. Last year something drastic happened. I had a bad trip will LSD, this led me to re-evaluate my choices. I gave up smoking, gave up porn and stopped drinking alone. I started working out, running 10ks, was feeling pretty good about myself. Post-November i started visualising all the bad things i did on my trip while i was on LSD. I started smoking again, watching porn again and stopped working out. I am unhappy at my job, personal life is good as my SO is very supportive even in this phase of life. I went to see a shrink but don't feel like going back to her now. I am going to try again with quitting cigarettes and porn. Wish me luck!! It was a good year but not ending on a great note.

There is no neat beginning or intro to this post, it is more of a brain dump of what is going on with me right now. Today I saw a [video of Jonathon Morris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jv5HIrOrn2o). He is a youtuber who does mostly reviews apple products. The video was a review of Mac Pro. He gave it to a couple of audio producers and asked them to use it to the fullest potential. In that video, you could see that the guy doing his work enjoyed what he was doing. He was having fun. He was ""lost"" in his profession. He was creating something, bought a song to the world which people love. He contributed something new to the world. This might not be something people remember for centuries, but he made something which only he could have made. In his style and that is something which makes him unique, and makes his work unique. If he was not there, this particular song would not be in the way you listen to it right now. There are some significance and irreplaceable to what he does. And he enjoys the process.

A bit about myself, I am a full stack developer. What I do is basically what 99% of software developers do most of the time. What I am doing is not unique, it is a copy of a copy of a copy. I am just building stuff for my company. This does not require a lot of thinking, I am on autopilot most of the time. I do encounter some sensitive decisions, but that is not the bulk of my work. I have no freedom to choose what I work on. I am limited by the domain/company decisions/business priorities etc.. And if I make a good utility that benefits the company, I won't be benefiting out of it, My company will. I won't be getting a significant raise. And I am replaceable. Period. If not me there will be always someone who will do the same thing. What is the point of doing this then? If there is nothing you are remembered for? If you don't bring anything new to the table? if everything is a copy of a copy of a copy?

Is what I want freedom? Because the current job pays me well, really well. I am enjoying the money I have. If it is the freedom I want, then why not be a freelancer? Can I afford to take such a risk? If no, then what is stopping me. Why can I not take that risk? Maybe because I do not have those many connections. What am I doing to improve that? Nothing. absolutely nothing. Another thought, do I see myself being a happy person after doing the same software development for 10 years. Do you think I will be happy being a freelancer/consultant? I honestly don't think so. Why? Because I don't think I will do something that someone else can't. I won't be contributing anything to my profession. I won't do anything new. I am still making a copy of a copy of a copy.

Can I afford to be broke by doing something I am passionate about? What is a passion? What am I passionate about? I like the idea of being a Writer/Video editor/Audio producer. Anything that wants me to be creative. Somewhere where I can experiment. Should I resign from my current position and seriously pursue something like this? I don't think I can do that as well. It is too much of a risk. And I don't think I am ready to be broke. I am in my comfort zone. I built a castle of what I call safe / comfort zone and I locked myself in it. I am not ready to step outside, I am being a coward. I am not trying.

I feel like I am having a crisis. I keep thinking about this a lot these days. I am not happy about the person I am. While I was studying computer science at my university I imagined myself to be a guy who works in a startup, creating stuff and earning a lot of money. Buying computers/audio gear and going to bars on the weekends. The definition of success quickly changed when I reached there. I am earning a decent amount and I am at a potential where I can buy what I want. I am still the same person feeling sad that I am not contributing anything to the world. With the money I have, I am still living frugally. I still have a room, I still have a phone, I still have a computer, a keyboard, a headphone. Everything got slightly fancier, more expensive. I am still the same person. Still dissatisfied, still trying to figure out what I will be remembered for. Still feeling sad that I am replaceable. Still sad that I do not have a unique identity or a unique impact.

There is one thing that keeps coming back, Legacy. What will you be remembered for once you are dead? It scares me that I will only be remembered by my family. Which is sad because they don't remember me. If I am dead, they don't remember me because ""I"" passed away. They are sad because ""Their son/brother/cousin"" passed away. The feelings are not unique because of me. they are as a virtue of their relation. It is saddening to see that the effect you have is since you are related. and not because of you. Everywhere else I am replaceable. If I resign today, the company will have a hard time for a month. But it will be fine after that. I am not essential for the success of the company, I am useful but not needed. What should I do with my \~ 70% of my life? Suicide is not an option because I will not chicken out of this. I need to figure out what I want to do with my life. I cannot be content with the relations and think family/friends will satisfy me. But what should I do? What makes me happy? How will I be content with what I am doing? What will make me content? I know a lot of people around me envy me for getting a decent salary and a good job. But I also envy people who are broke and yet happy. Now that I know that money is not the solution to my problem, what is? Can I let go of money to search for what makes me happy?

90,"It happened this morning. The route we walk on takes us around a couple of fields. On one side of the fields is a railway line, the other, a cliffside. It's not the safest, but it's all we have to walk around by where we live. 

Anyway I have two dogs. One always runs ahead, the other tends to go and do his own thing for a couple of minutes and then circle back to me. I carry treats so they never run ahead from me for long before coming back for treats, and their recall is really good.

I'd been walking for a few minutes and realised I hadn't seen one of them in a little while. I blew my whistle, called for him, did everything that under normal circumstances would have had him come bolting back towards me in a shot.

He never showed up. 

My other dog stayed by me. We walked to the railway line and I hopped the fence, tearing the skin on my palms. He wasnt anywhere on the railway line. 

Now I'm panicking, because I think that maybe he somehow got through the fence on the opposite side of the field and ran too far before falling off of the cliff edge. My heart was absolutely in my mouth and I was picturing the worst.

I absolutely freaked. I was calling for him, in tears, with no idea where he was or what had happened.

I stayed calling him for about 10 minutes before I heard him come thundering back to me. He came from the opposite direction, away from the cliff side. I fell down in front of him and just hugged him for a minute.

Nothing like that has ever happened before, and I have had my dogs for 5 years. We've always walked on this route. 

The weirdest part was that when he came back, his harness was gone. I'm going to look for it tomorrow. It is so odd though, with the style of harness he wears, I dont understand how it came off of him. That and why he disappeared in the first place. 

It was scary. I don't have anyone to talk about this with so I guess that's why I'm writing this out here. I almost lost my dog today. I am so, so, so grateful I didn't.",15Dec2019,1

92,"We were best friends for 6-7 years and a year before he ended a very toxic relationship (which I didn't know it was toxic but later found out after it ended because I never met the other person) and a few days later he started a new relationship with another girl. I said to him although I was happy for him, I didn't think it was a good idea to start a new relationship before doing full recovery from the previous one. He agreed but didn't really care. So, a year passes and they had many fights and after every fight he would come over me and would tell me what had happened. And many of the times the reason behind fights was her being immature and not being ready for a relationship. At first I said  to him talking was the solution but later when we realized talking wasn't the solution because she never listened, I said to him breaking up seems a better way to go because when you're in a toxic relationship it leaves a mark on you. 

&amp;#x200B;

Few days ago they, again, had a fight. They were suspecting she had fungus infection and the doctor told her that she should use the first pill and not the second and should come over to get tested. He said so, too and she promised to go. When the day came she didn't want to go and blamed him for not supporting/caring about her and blocked him. It really seemed to me like it would be finally the day they would break up but, alas, they got together like nothing has happened.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's his decision to make, and I respect it. But as a person who really cares about him this situation has become too overbearing, too emotionally draining for me. So I texted him saying I wanted a break and gave my reasoning. He texted back that although he was upset and didn't want to have a break he understood my decision.",15Dec2019,1

94,"For my whole life I have been pushed around and treated unfairly. I am not being hypocrite that I haven’t done anything bad in my life, when I have. 

I have been perceived to be an introvert quiet girl. To the point that I have stopped wanting to be like this. I am who I am and I can’t change it, however I do have my voice to voice out.

I have been burdening myself and picking up pieces I should have forgotten about ages ago. I have been told by close good friends to “let it go”, “you have to forget about it”. 

The majority of the world would agree to this because the best  thing to do is to grow up and leave everything. But not me. I am growing every single day and because you are not me or anyone else you will never know how I or others feel. 

If I want to think about something from 6 years ago and let it trouble me, I will. It’s my mind and body, not yours. 

Everyone says it’s better to let it go and be a better person. How can I or others be a better person if we are hurting. People don’t realise it, but when they say that they make it out like we are wrong when we aren’t. 

We are hurt and broken and it’s not about healing, it’s about honesty. If I want someone to know they treated me bad, I will. 

It’s not anyone’s call but mine. 

Sometimes words have to be said otherwise nothing will be said. Like I say, we aren’t mind readers where all of a sudden we know how someone feels or what they think. Words allow us to express what we feel. 

When people ask for opinions online they want validation and a lot of responses so that they can head in the right direction. You don’t need opinions from anyone because if you want to do something then do it. 

Just because person A,B,C,D says to you “don’t do it”. If you know it’s the right thing for you and it gives you peace then do it. Just don’t do something that you will know the consequences are bad. 

That’s all I have to say. There are times in our life where we don’t do anything because people tell us “it’s not right”, “be a better person”. If we listen to them, then we may never get our point across and sometimes we have to do because it eats us away.",15Dec2019,1

Problem with a co-worker

I'm having an issue with a supervisor at work and lately it's making me more depressed/anxious. He feels the need to put me down in front of others. I try to blow it off and not let it bother me but lately it's getting to me. Especially since I'm stressed at home because my boyfriend has started chemo. For example the other day we were discussing a word game we played at lunch and he made it a point to say ""you know, the one Erica had a problem with"".  I will say one of my coworkers turned around and said ""I had a problem with that one also"". Joking around a few times is one thing but this is happening more and more. I've been biting my tongue for fear that something nasty is going to come out, which could make matters worse. The other issue is he might be my supervisor in the near future. My fears are is going to get worse, I'm going to say something really nasty or others will see him doing it and think it's ok to start doing it. A coworker said he does it to get a rise but I don't see him doing it to others at lunch. Also, as soon as I ignore him and he knows I'm pissed he tries to come over and be nice.

96,"I am in my hometown now. From Friday until today I was visiting my boyfriend. Our relationship is still fresh and new. He has experienced so much more than me, he has a positive outlook on life and is intelligent af - even though he is younger than me. 

So today we had, simply said, a discussion. We cuddled in bed and he told me about how difficult to handle I can be at times. I couldn't hold my tears back - because little did he know that I was living with a much worse mindset my whole life. I know that I am still not really healthy though and that I had stopped to work on my mindset because I got too comfortable with the place I am right now. So.. he told me about how to fix it, we talked about where my problems most likely come from (my childhood) and that he was where I am now. He told me how he also has to work on things - just not on the same as me. 

So why do I write this post? I guess it helps me to clear my mind and to organize my thoughts. I don't want to be like I am right now and our discussion really helped me to see that. I was to happy with how my progress went - but I am not where I should be. I did so much wrong things in my past but I have to accept that. Only the present moment truly exists. The past is memories and the future only a vision. 

I don't want to cling to people anymore. I don't want to cling to safety. In my search for safety I gave up everything else. I don't want the comfort zone to be my home anymore - but where do I start? I want to be a confident and strong woman, I don't want anyone to save me, I want to save myself from myself. Even though he helped me to see that I don't want him to be my savior. Once someone has a place in my heart it's hard to let go - but I want to be my own best friend, my own savior, my own motivational coach, my own helpmate - and I know I can do it. I can find the path that leads to happiness. I can find the path that leads to freedom.

97,"I think until now there's been quite little talk about just how wild wild west the Web is, so I like the talk about breaking up Google.

The problem is that Google can use its cross-platform cross-product cross-industry reach to have a significant uncompetitive advantage. A banal example would be Google hassling non-Chrome users to use Chrome, or a link to Gmail sitting at the corner of your Google Search screen. As far as the market goes, that's stealing, because you're getting market share not through competition, but by bypassing competition.

Google didn't become a behemoth in so many markets just because its products are good, but because it had an uncompetitive advantage, which is a cryptic way of saying that they were very big in an unregulated environment and they used that.

103,"Going through school I was bullied by a few different people, as many others also have. There was this one particular guy named Alex which was the worst. He was on the same school bus as me, both on the way to and from school. Everyday he’d do many things that would hurt me, both physically and psychologically. He’d slap me, spit on me, call me all sorts of names, steal my stuff (like he once stole my cap, another time he stole my so treasured Pikachu card which was a gift from my grandmother that came inside the Pokémon 2000 movie I won for my birthday), and overall just pretty bad stuff. I hated him, with all my heart and soul, but I was never the type of guy who would fight back, even though we were the same age and I was physically bigger then him. I’ve always just suffered in silence. This went on from sixth grade all the way up to 1st yeah High School. A couple of months before the year was over (1st year HS that is), I heard from a friend of mine (which he also bullied) that he would be moving to another state. When I heard it I became overfilled with happiness knowing that the worst of my school problems would be far gone in a few days. However things took a completely different turn. As it turns out I discovered that he was moving because his father had been arrested for getting involved with drug trafficking and his mother was dealing with drug addiction so he was leaving to go live with his grandparents. I’ve had a similar life situation as his. I was raised by my grandparents as well because my father was a drug user and dealer, and my mother couldn’t raise me alone (she didn’t use drugs, she was just unemployed and I was a “broken condom” child), so my grandparents “adopted” me when I was 5. When his last day in our school came, we took the bus like every other day. This day however he didn’t bully me like he would normally do, and instead was sitting in the back of the bus, all quiet and keeping to himself. We lived about 4 blocks away from each other and when the bus stopped at his house I came out of the bus behind him. He looked at me and said “What the f*ck do you want f*ggot?”. I said “Don’t worry, I understand”. I was waiting for a punch to land between my eyes but instead he just stood there looking at me. I went for it and hugged him. I said “I forgive you”. He didn’t say anything but I saw his eyes water a bit. Just writing about this makes me tear up a bit. I walked away and I’ve never seen him since. I don’t know what happened with him since then, but I don’t have any grudges or resentment from what he did to me. I truly hope it all went well in his life. I haven’t seen him anywhere on social media yet so I don’t know what happened after that. All I can say for all of you who have also been bullied in your life, is that bullying goes both ways. We can hate our bullies as much as we want, and it honestly takes a lot to forgive someone who hurts you.

107,"I just graduated last friday with a BS in Liberal Studies; now I'm am crying and feeling shame about my decision after looking at a post on r/pics of someone graduating from the same university but with an MIS degree. I knew about the well proclaimed job prospects going in to this degree as a STEMlord in high school. I also knew full well of the consequences of this being an asian male with family that wants me to be a rich doctor. You'd asked how does a STEMlord with an asian family choose to go with a Liberal Studies degree? 

Knowing full well with my struggles with keeping a good grade in AP Calculus AB, I have applied to college with a biology degree with an aim to get into medical school. I was also the guy in high school who managed to get the highest score in government class even though I forgot there was even a test until 10 minutes before class started. I dismissed this talent in favor of choosing something in STEM or the medical field due to the salaries and perceived job opportunities. I was thinking about physical therapy as an option for a career. I basically went for biology due to the perceived lack of math or so I thought...

As a STEMlord at the time I thought it was Bio&gt;MCAT&gt;med school&gt;residency&gt;money, trophy wife, big house, lots of cars, and commanding respect. I also thought the same for engineering or comp sci but with less steps and more math. My personal finance class introduced me to Dave Ramsey (basically living without debt for anything) which made me aim towards medical field. With the aim of having this kind of life, a high paying career seemed like a good choice in a teenager's mind. At the same time, I was also fixing other people's computers and using linux on my personal computer. 

Around the end of 5th grade, my computer was being the most painful thing in the world. The athlon XP 1800+ with XP SP3 was not able to handle the 20 tabs on Opera. I've decided to put ubuntu linux and other distros such as mandriva, mint, and others. Before sophomore year of high school, I was going on arch linux. I've been stuck switching between linux and windows until I got a mac in college. I still struggle with command line and scripts which made me not consider comp sci. IT youtubers' aggressive personalities on camera scared me away from any technitian or help desk related work around senior year of high school and freshman year of college. 

As I graduated high school, the Texas Oil industry was on a feast with my mom's coworkers and family friends pushing towards Petroleum engineering. People were bragging about their 100k signup bonus like it was easy with very little context or details. People who weren't doctors or engineers were promoting these careers as if they were money printing machines. My asian family especially those in the US are hypercompetitive for getting more money as they themselves have seen huge jumps in living standards coming from their home countries. This context places a kind of  in my adolescent mind that it kind of seems so easy that I could do it and that I want a lot of stuff. 

The hypercompetitive environment in high school also contributed with the stubbornness too. Everyone in the school was told to go get a high paying career such as engineering, management, comp sci, and medical field. From students, parents, and even the theater teacher were promoting those career paths. To put things in context, I was enrolled in a relatively expensive private school in a major metropolitan area. The school costs about the same as college tuition and dorm in Texas. My parents also told me to focus on studying and told their stories which I have not put any thought into until sociology class. But adolescent me was all over the place; following tech news, looking at new cars, video games, girls, and food. 

Ohh, back to math class.. Orientation for Biology majors comes in, and the four year degree plan is put in my place in paper: premed with four additional bio courses. So I put these classes for the first semester: Bio lecture and lab, pre-cal (could have placed out but missed one question), chem lecture and lab, english, and additional practice courses for those STEM classes. I also joined some medical club at school. I was fortunate that my parents footed the tuition which gave me time to study rather than work. I hunkered down in the library to study and made friends who also planned on going to med school. I went to class and did assignments and passed my answers and helped my friends. I ate healthy and exercised for the first semester resulting in a good amount of weight loss. But as the first semester rolls, the grades kept getting lower. 

First semester GPA was a hair under 2 and I was put into academic warning. I replaced chem with history and went on to Cal 1. A C in bio and an F in Cal 1( remind you I took AP Cal AB) put me in academic probation. And here comes academic advising, the advisor said ""did you skip every class?"" when I did go to every class but I only did the minimum except for history and english where I turned everything in a week early. I have to talk to a school psychologist and a career counselor and they asked ""is this the right path?"" I basically snubbed their advice and continued the medical field path with no interest on it. I continued on the path by doing the same thing: minimum STEM, other classes that had an essay were turned in early. This resulted in a STEM classes dragging my grades down to a 2.3 GPA in my junior year. 

Second semester of my junior year and failing both cal 2 and orgo 1, made the switch to liberal studies. With all my kinesiology minor credits in, and 2 classes of bio left, I decided a liberal studies degree is a way out of shame and fear. I chose sociology and supply chain minors as part of my degree. MIS major requires a 3.0 GPA to transfer which blocked me out of that path. The only person that knows my GPA is a friend. There was also a time limit as my parents are retiring and even with their large savings, incomes, and pensions I could not bear the guilt of them paying my tuitiom longer than 4 years. 

I feel regret when it comes to my job search, decisions, and career planning but there were some upsides. I still struggle to explain my degree to almost everyone I talk to and am not excited about christmas for fears that I might get grilled by Asian family members (should I pass out drunk on christmas and new years?). I meet many awesome and supportive people along the way. Everyone from the classes I failed and passed to the girl sitting next to me in graduation were awesome to talk to and makes me relieved that there is a world beyond a money rat race.

Sorry about the novel I wrote reddit.

TLDR; I was encouraged to do premed by asian family and switched to liberal studies after failing Orgo chem and cal 2 twice.",15Dec2019,1

My birthday just passed and everyone except her forgot it even though I’ve been talking about it for weeks. My other “friends” didn’t even make an effort to even TRY and come see me or go out to eat. I had to remind my family. 

My mom constantly complains about having to support me financially in any way and does not support me emotionally at all. Every time I’ve been vulnerable around her she tells me to get over. I woke up at 6, went to school, finished at 4, went to work at 5,  got off at 11, and finished my hw around 1. Yet she still made me clean the bathroom and kitchen while my brother played video games and my older sister napped. 

My older sister hates doing anything for me at all. She’s not even willing to spare $2 on me when she works full time. She was mad when she had to pick me up from school once even though she wasn’t doing anything else. Literally anything that has to do with me inconveniences her. She is the most selfish person I’ve ever met. 

My cousin and aunt constantly use and manipulate me. I made an entire post of it if anyone is interested.

I can’t work online either. All I need is enough for a car, but no way of getting it. I’m only 17, so if I did get a job I’d  have to work minimum wage. Therefore it’d take me weeks to get enough.

I was talking to my friend about how I have no desire to see my life past 30. I can’t even imagine it. Now I have no desire to live past 20. Sometimes I find myself wishing for a terminal disease. I just want it all to end even if I have to end it myself.",15Dec2019,1
116,"So my title essentially says it all, I work as an escort that caters to a very large network of extremely wealthy people.


Usually when someone asks me what I mean by ""High Class"" I compare myself to like the stereotypical women you see in movies that spend there time hanging out at extremely rich mens mansions or with politicians, Ive never worked with a politician and I havent really ever been paid to hangout in a mansion though im just using those as examples because thats always the stereotype you see in movies.


Just about 99.9% of my work involves me taking trips to other countries and staying at a very expensive resort with whoever im asked to stay with, almost always that person is the son of some obscenely wealthy family line. Ironically its almost never the one who bankrolls the trip who is with me or if they are around im not there for them im assigned to there son. Im basically now the go to for that type of work and have been for a little over a year, ive been escorting for roughly 2ish years overall.


I can make anywhere from 8k to 30k and up per trip and that doesnt include whatever is being spent for the trip itself.

You don’t even need to write a book, just grab a piece of paper and start writing down what’s on your mind, but I find writing a book kills two birds with one stone.

129,"I've been sick for a few months. It started with being extremely sick for over a month in September, and I ended up being hospitalized for a week with complications from double pneumonia. During that month I sustained a high fever that would not go down with medication. I dont even understand why I got the flu and then pneumonia and had severe complications... A few weeks after that I started getting sick again. Rashes. Excessively itchy eyes. Random fevers. Joint pain. Fatigue. Malaise. Stomach pain and vomiting. Honestly, I thought it was some sort of residual problems from the severe illnesses I had. But then roughly two weeks ago my hair started falling out. And not a normal amount. Clumps. It's so bad that I can't touch it without a massive clump coming out and I'm scared to wash or brush it because my hair falls out even more then. My brush has to be cleaned everytime I brush my hair because the loss is so bad. My clothing and bed are covered in hair.

132,"Hi reddit, this is a long one so feel free to skip it if it’s not your thing.

Ever since I was little I was always a bit different. I was incredibly creative inclined and never really gelled well with school and homework. I found it difficult to find work fun so didn’t ever consider it worth my time. Up till age 11 I would do nothing but doodle, play video games and watch the same Disney movies over and over.

At the same time my mum and nan (or grandma for you lovely Americans) would fight a lot. My mum was young, depressed, broken from my biological dad who left when I was 1, and in debt. We stayed at my nan’s house for 90% of my childhood and I was almost always the thing the two would argue about. I didn’t really have a way to cope with it at such a young age so it slowly bled into me that fighting and arguing was natural.

Years pass and I do well on a big test that means I get to join the top 10% of the population’s kids in these special “Grammar schools”. Because of this my perception of how well I’m doing in school drops. I’m no longer comparing myself to the population but only the 10%. If you had given me the option, I would never have gone to a grammar school at all.

Throughout school I find it hard to connect with many people and the kids I do fit in with still aren’t quite my tribe. If that makes any sense. There is this one friend I make that means the world to me. My mum wasn’t a bad person but she suffered from a lot of mental health issues and often didn’t give me the kind of intimacy I needed, so I tried getting it from my friend. They reciprocated a lot of my feelings but in the end got sick of me and broke our friendship while blaming me. 

I had great artistic motivation until I finally hit puberty at age 12 and began my fight with depression that I still struggle with today. After that I lost all motivation and any enjoyment I gained from anything skill based vanished. I no longer doodled in my free time and gave up on doing anything that made me feel worthless.

When I was 14 I discovered music and while I did have a few flings with music before, I truly fell in love with it. I started listening to Eminem who I could relate to with his violence, sadness and “fuck you” attitude. His music spoke to me and I fell into the rabbit hole that was Rap and Hip-Hop. 2Pac is still a huge inspiration as well as Biggie Smalls, N.W.A and Nas. As I developed I learned to appreciate the newer artists too, Kendrick Lamar, J.Cole, Denzel Curry, Joey Bada$$ and J.I.D. However, my biggest inspiration would consume me, shortly after his death I started listening to XXXTentacion.

I had never heard anyone’s music describe the pain I felt daily, even nearly as well as he could. His music changed me forever and I credit everything to him. I used X as a launchpad to find more inspiration and found it in the form of Nirvana and Mac Miller. If you were to ask me who my main inspirations are in life, it would be X, then Eminem, then Kurt Cobain.

Now I’m thinking to myself, “wow I finally found some passion. A real passion to express myself with and propel me in life.” I thought I’d found the thing that would make me feel a little less down and that I could turn into a career. But as I tried day after day of continuous pushing, I genuinely couldn’t find the passion when it came to the music making. Nothing I do brings me joy. I still adore music but I can’t stomach more than 10 minutes trying to play the guitar and make a melody before I hate myself too much and give up. I’ve tried every instrumental at my disposal, every software I could think of and even bought myself a midi keyboard and mic in order to push myself. I’ve spent countless hours sitting down trying to gain any pleasure from making music but I just can’t find any.

I thought maybe it was just music but no, I can’t stomach art anymore. It’s still the only thing that even remotely interests me but I find no joy in it. It’s the one thing I was sure I would have forever, my ability and natural nack for the creative. But it’s gone.

I’ve been really struggling recently. I’ve been resorting to drugs to try and feel any sense of happiness. I got a school councillor but she’s so dismissive of my problems and she makes me feel like an idiot. I refuse to take any form of anti-depressants after my mum took them for so long it almost ruined her. I’ve been an insomniac since I got the depression and also recently starting cutting myself. I don’t do things to look cool or edgy. I do it all to feel better. And sometimes for a split second I do but it always disappears.

I don’t know where to go now. I’ve been considering suicide for the longest time but now actually seems appropriate. I’m not trying to Karma whore. I genuinely need help and I don’t know what to do. I’m so done with everything and everyone. I’ve pursued anything I’ve even remotely as an interest in, in order to try and reignite my motivation but nothing works.

I told you my life story so that maybe you could understand where I’m coming from.

There’s a great quote that says, “Everyday it gets a little easier, but you gotta do it everyday, that’s the hard part”. What are you supposed to do when it won’t even start? Let alone get easier.

135,"On the 1st January 2018, at roughly 2am, I sat on my bed. I’d just been to a party and I was motivated for the year ahead. I opened up the notes app on my phone and wrote ‘2018 is your year. Own it.’ I was 16. 

2018 was the most turbulent year of my life. I lost a dog (heaviest loss of my life so far), and had a lot of health scares and setbacks within the family. However, despite the bumpiness of the journey, 2018 was undoubtedly the greatest year I’ve had. I got incredible exam results after working hard, went to music festivals, won a national trophy with my sports team and generally just had an amazing time. I’d set myself goals and achieved nearly all of them. 

So, on the 1st January 2019 at a similar hour early in the morning, again motivated to do well, I opened up notes. I saw 2018’s message and wrote ‘same again this year.’ 

The thing is, 2019 has been far from great. Now, in no way has it been bad, I am constantly grateful for my family and the opportunities that are available to me. But, I think I’m lost. University starts in 9 months and I have no idea of an industry I’d like to go into. I’m not getting on with my college subjects and am losing motivation. I’m mentally strong and will never give up, but it’s getting harder. I’ve again failed with girls and will end 2019 with never having kissed a girl. I did have my first ever first date with a stunning girl, but nothing came from it. I’m 18. It’s not a big deal, but all the little things add up. 

I wanted to keep the momentum going of last year but it’s like I’m running in slow motion. For the first time, I don’t have a purpose going forward. 

Hopefully, on the 1st January 2020, I’ll be sat in the same spot as the previous years, writing another motivational message. Only this time, I’ll follow up on the statement and emulate 2018 or, better yet, surpass it.",15Dec2019,1

He got sick in april of this year. As he got worse, my mom, sister and I had to be his live in nurses. We did everything from feed him to change him every single day. Hed always been independent and hated we had to do it, but he always told us how good we took care of him.  I knew this would come at some point but I didnt wanna believe it, so i convinced myself hed just be around forever. But I went to work this morning and a neighbor came in. She told me to leave my car there, she needed to take me home. I asked why. She said it’d be better coming from my mom. I knew.
