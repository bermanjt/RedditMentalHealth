3," Seems to me that it would be easy to hack anyone’s phone crossing the border, install spyware, then monitor their entire digital footprint, location, contacts, and whereabouts. Such information could be used with an AI algorithm to generate a score for how violent the person is and prevent them from committing a crime before it happens - anywhere they go in the US.

6,"I took my kids to an open gym type thing at their school tonight. I was just me and them, and one wanted to go off and do something with a friend my little one ran off and wasn’t listening, and it was noisy and a ton of kids running around and screaming. Then my oldest had a meltdown in the dinner line because they didn’t have anything she liked.
It just really wasn’t a great night for me. 

We’re home now and I’m so on edge. I’m trying to relax but I feel like I’m jumping out of my skin.  It’s hard to catch my breath and I feel like crying or screaming. My chest is tight.  It’s been like 45 minutes and I still feel exactly like I did when I walked into my house. 

I’ve had panic attacks before but they come in suddenly and then they’re over. It’s never prolonged like this. ",17Jan2019,1
7,"So obviously this whole fucking subreddit already hates me cause of the muskrat story, which I can guarantee is not bullshit but whatever.

For those of you whom did not see the muskrat story, I am 14 years old, and I have a tendency to do weird shit in school. I am basically known for being that kid who makes poor descisions. So anyways, today, I thought it would be funny to snort hole punches during French class after emptying out the teachers 3 hole puncher onto my desk. So I make lines of them, and at this point i’m not thinking about how badly this could end, I’m just thinking how fucking funny this is. Our teacher was going over the answers to a sheet we did, and i just snort a line of about 30 hole punches. The second they enter my nose, i realize i fucked up. They were all wedged up my nose and my nose immediately began gushing blood. I just put my face into my sweatshirt and sprinted out of the room. I realized I couldn’t go to the nurse because it would be mad awkward to explain to her how i snorted hole punches, and she would call my parents who would disown me. So I spent an hour locked in the bathroom bawling my eyes out and trying to get the paper out of my nose with the rough school paper towels and water. It was second to last period though, so when i got home i got most of the hole punches out with Vaseline, water, and q-tips. But my nose is still filled with paper cuts and sore as fuck.

and also, pleasssssse dont comment about what a dick i seem like, I’ve already heard it on every one of my reddit posts, and all I can say is that you dont know me, and its pretty pathetic to harass a kid you dont know online.

Tl;dr: I got a bloody nose and paper cuts when hole punches got stuck up my nose after i snorted them. Never snort hole punches. You will regret it. Just dont fucking do it.

8,"I live in a family of five. My parents, me, and two brothers. I love my family and that’s why it pains me so much to see who we what we represent. I am the oldest in my family (14) and my youngest brother is 8. He has been diagnosed with many mental disorders like ADHD and ODD.

He has always been hyper and a bit of a nuisance, but now I can barely recognize the person he has become. Over the past few years he has slowly become more defiant and has caused me and my family grief. 

He is stuck in the mindset that he can get anything he wants. He throws massive temper tantrums if his needs aren’t met. He has cussed out my parents and says he “wants to go to hell”. He has pulled out knives from the kitchen, but what scares me the most is when he tries to jump over the balcony to kill himself.

My parents are hurt greatly by this and feel like they’ve failed at parenting. My brother has physically abused my father many times. (Being only 8 it doesn’t do much damage). This has caused my father to retaliate by hitting him back, and it has only led to my brother throwing more fits. I don’t see my father as a child abuser, but what I see is that my brother has done a great toll on the mental health of the people around him.

Therapy has been tried and failed several times. He refuses to cooperate and has tried to jump out of the car several times to avoid it. 

One of his many problems is the fact that he’s addicted to his computer which has been one of the many reasons for the start of a fit. (Trying to take it away only leads to more pain for my parents.)

All of this has negatively effected my mental health. Every time one of his episodes occur I feel helpless and a deep feeling of grief. I lie in bed bawling my eyes out in fear that he might actually kill himself and then I might never get to see my parents again. At home I don’t feel any sense of place or belonging. Everyday when I come home from school, I know it will all happen again.

My brother has no care for self or others and only tries to get what he wants. What I fear most is what he is yet to become. I fear that one day he will act upon the threats he has directed towards my parents.

I try not to think about all of this. But as time progresses, it only gets worse. So I am looking for some form of advice.

9,"Ah, shit.

Today's not your day.

You've been to Great Places.

But things didn’t go your way.

&amp;#x200B;

You had brains in your head.

You had feet in your shoes.

And here you find yourself

yesterday's news.

You're on your own. Not in the fun way.

As it turns OUT, your fiancé is gay.

&amp;#x200B;

You look up and down streets. Look 'em over with care.

And sigh to yourself, ""How the hell’d I get here?""

With a house full of kids and a bank full of debt,

you're too far down this path to reset.

&amp;#x200B;

You sit in your car

you smile, then frown

It sure would be nice

to just zip out of town

&amp;#x200B;

It's opener there

in the wide open air.

&amp;#x200B;

Out there things can happen

And frequently do

to people far younger

and smarter than you.

&amp;#x200B;

Things used to happen,

you did things, you flew

before you partook

in a condom-less screw.

&amp;#x200B;

OH!

THE PLACES YOU'VE BEEN!

&amp;#x200B;

You did cool things!

You had many a friend!

In hindsight those days

were the end of a trend.

&amp;#x200B;

You didn't try much, you hadn't the need.

The friends you dismissed have taken the lead.

To those people now, you are back of mind.

They're living their lives; they’ve left you behind.

&amp;#x200B;

Except when they didn't.

Because, sometimes, they died.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm happy to say so

quite often, it's true

that Shooters

and Cancers

kill good people too.

&amp;#x200B;

They gave to the homeless

and spent time at church.

Yet you're still alive.

For meaning, you'll Search.

&amp;#x200B;

You'll come back from the Search

with less answers than before.

Yearning for comfort,

you'll pay for a Whore.

&amp;#x200B;

And now you've fucked a Whore.

You're not in for much fun.

Chlamydia tests

will have to be done.

&amp;#x200B;

You will go to a place where they STD screen.

And a doctor will poke and prod at your peen.

A place where your life could come to an end.

Do you go by yourself? Do you call on a friend?

Is there anyone left? On whom you can depend?

&amp;#x200B;

And IF you are sick, would it matter a mite…

Would you scream at the heavens? Would you put up a fight?

Or cry over photos of your once-to-be wife?

Common it is, the examples are rife,

for a life-fucker-upper to fuck up his life.

&amp;#x200B;

You can get so depressed

that you'll start to lose faith

stealing warm, happy feelings from a smokable eighth

your hippocampus as dormant as an indolent wraith,

headed, I fear, towards a comatose state.

The Hoping State…

&amp;#x200B;

…for people just hoping.

Hoping for a place to stay

or a way to leave, or a face to stay

or the pain to leave, or a faith to stay

or the phone to ding, or the end to end

or the hoping around for a Yay or Nay

or hoping for something to do for a day.

Everyone is just hoping.

&amp;#x200B;

Hoping for the cop to pass

or hoping for a tank of gas

or hoping for a benign mass

or hoping, perhaps, for their Father Frank

or a plan to work, or a Bigger Bank

or a thing to do, or a thought to think

or a way to be, or Another Drink.

Everyone is just hoping.

&amp;#x200B;

NO!

That’s not for you!

&amp;#x200B;

Somehow you’ll escape

all that hoping and moping

You’ll find the dark places

Where Trap Songs are playing.

&amp;#x200B;

With coke snort-snorting,

once more you’ll be high!

Ready for anything under the sky.

Ready, in fact, to beat up that guy!

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, the places you’ve been! It’s time to be done!

The chips are all down. The game has been won.

And the things you did for another eightball

have made you the sucky-est sucker of all.

Blame! You’re as to blame as you can be,

With the whole wide bar watching you pee.

&amp;#x200B;

Except when they don’t.

Because sometimes they won’t.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m afraid that some times

you’ll get high alone too.

Cracking jokes to no laughs

‘cause you told them to you.

&amp;#x200B;

All Alone!

Whether you like it or not,

Alone is something

you’ve been quite a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

And when you’re alone, there’s a very good chance

you'll wake up each morning in yesterday’s pants.

There was one, up the road between hither and yon,

that gave you the courage you needed to go on.

&amp;#x200B;

But on she went

though she said no goodbye.

On she went

though you tried not to lie.

On she went

through the Wonky-Tonks cry.

Onwards past many

a frightening creep,

though her feelings may hurt,

she took a big leap.

&amp;#x200B;

On and on she went,

And you know she went far

for while she ran

you followed by car.

&amp;#x200B;

You got mixed up, of course,

because of the blow.

You got mixed up

with some guys who lay low.

So look where you’ve been.

Maybe lay off the grass

and remember that Life’s

a Big Pain in the Ass.

Just never abandon the time you have left.

Pick yourself up; at that, you’re one of the best.

&amp;#x200B;

And will you succeed?

Who knows? Who knows indeed?

(Nothing in life can be guaranteed.)

&amp;#x200B;

BUD, YOU’VE GOT YEARS LEFT!

So…

&amp;#x200B;

be your name Curtain or Caply or Cay

or Ice Cube’s son Jackson Jr., O’Shea,

You’ve been to Great Places!

Why not go back today?

Your potential is waiting.

11,"Hello, I am a 14 year old male. Recently, I have experienced chest pain and tightness.

(Sorry, long post, as I have to explain a bit)

It all started on Monday evening. I had just come home from a friend's house, where I had slept over on Sunday night. I began to feel a tight feeling in my chest, and this scared me and my heart rate rose and I began to sweat (although that was probably from anxiety). There was no pain.

The symptoms completely stopped after an hour or so, and I slept overnight fine. I had no symptoms throughout Tuesday until about 11pm at night (I usually sleep before then, by the way).

My chest began to feel tight again, around my heart and the centre. There was also a bit of mild pain around my heart and the centre of my chest. The symptoms lasted for about an hour, and I was fine until Wednesday afternoon when the symptoms spiked again.

I have had no major symptoms in the mornings.

I have no shortness of breath or difficulty breathing or swallowing. My nose is not congested and I do not have a cough. The last time I was sick from any infection was a while ago. I have no pain or tightness anywhere but my chest area (my arms, legs, head and back are fine).

The pain is only mild and comes and goes. The tightness is the biggest symptom and sometimes spreads to my neck area. If I sleep, the symptoms calm down, and there seems to be no trigger - I get the symptoms no matter if I am lying down or exercising.

Twisting my body doesn't hurt, so I don't think the pain is from an injury or muscle problem. I also don't feel hungry and don't eat much.

I think it may be a heart problem, but I have no history of any problems and my family has not suffered any heart attacks. 

It has been almost three days since the first symptoms appeared, and things don't seem to be getting any better. It is worrying me. Should I see a doctor?",17Jan2019,1
13,"first off, I'm still new to posting in Reddit so if this is the wrong forum I apologize ... I thought maybe it could be considered a confession but it's not really a dirty secret and I'd appreciate some honest feedback ...   


okay so 34F here and after dealing with years of self-consciousness over my minimal chest size I can finally say I'm fully comfortable and confident in my small tits - to a point .. and that being that in the comfort of my own home I love going bra-less .. I don't really have the boobs to fill out a wired bra and I find the damn things super uncomfortable. In my teens and early twenties I wore all the padded, push up, foam, gel insert bras you could imagine trying to achieve the look of having a fuller chest, but after becoming pregnant and dealing with real boobs I realized I'm happy with having small tits.   


when I said I wanted some feedback I'm asking about this, what's sexier to a man, a woman with small tits wearing a padded bra (that I'm sure men can tell it's padded) or a women confident with her small tits going bra-less? I do wear bra like undergarments so that I'm appropriate in public situations, I'm asking more in regards to intimate situations. I mean, you men can tell that boobs look that way because of a bra, right? so why be fake and uncomfortable?

18,"About a month ago, a few days before Christmas, The local shelter in my county does free adoptions for the last ten or so days before the year ends, so my girlfriend and I ended up adopting a 9 year old border collie mix that the shelter had dubbed “Gravy”. Gravy’s way too cute a name to change, so we kept it. She’d been in the shelter a long time, about eight months, partly because of her age and partly because when she had first gotten to the shelter she had tried to bite a handler. For people with kids, a dog with a bite warning isn’t optimal, and some people will ignore any dog with a bite warning. 

They told us about the bite warning, but we were happy to give a dog another chance. Maybe i’m giving myself too much credit, but I’m pretty good with dogs, as I’d grown up with 3 of them. Since I fancy myself good with dogs, I figured I could probably get the dog to like me. That, and we were very intent on walking out with a dog that day. 

Gravy was really shy at first, but when we approached her one by one, she eagerly licked our fingers and rolled on her back. I immediately fell in love with her, and we walked out with her that day. The animal control lady who helped us visit the dog seemed pretty relieved to see Gravy go to a home, and have a bittersweet goodbye to her. 

The dog is as obsessed with me as I am with her. When I’m home, she follows me everywhere. On days where my girlfriend works and I don’t, she slides into bed and sleeps with me after she’s left. She obeys my commands (she’s obviously already trained, both with basic commands and house training) and she’s learned a few new ones. Border collie’s are super smart, and Gravy’s definitely the smartest dog I’ve ever had. 

The reason she breaks my heart every day when I get home from work is how she reacts. She tucks her tail between her legs, rolls onto her back, and whimpers with the most intense relief and happiness I’ve ever heard. It breaks my heart because I’m worried that while I’m gone, she thinks she’s been abandoned by her family again. It makes me so sad to think about how she ended up in the shelter to begin with. It is eventually swallowed up by a warm feeling about giving her a second chance, though. If any dog deserved one, it’s Gravy. Hopefully I can give this old lady a good retirement. ",17Jan2019,1

20,"I view the term ""offended"" as a very personal feeling.  For example, with regards to this Gillette ad I hate (I do not say that often) that people are offended by it, as if anyone or group that would put something out that offends anyone is now bad.  This culture has turned speech into the most conservative manner (ironic because its ""typically"" the left (or liberal) that have this easily offended attitude).  To me this centers around respect.  We have moved to a thought that every idea, belief, or action needs to be respected by everyone.  For one last (crazy) example, take a woman who was formally a man.  I want to call them(?) a man, but they ask to be called a woman, stating they are a woman.  I could look at that the same as a person wanting to be called King, and I may find that crazy and decide I do not like that and call them by what I feel is appropriate.  People ASK to be called something, which means there is freedom for me to regard them how I will.

22," Seems like people are freaking out on both sides of this ad in ways that are totally overblown. One side is treating it like the worst offense against men in the history of the world, and the other seems to say that anyone with a negative opinion about the ad is a fragile male snowflake.

I didn’t love the ad. I’m not going to boycott Gillette (to be fair, I buy whatever razor is cheapest without being shitty). Here are a couple things I found problematic:

* The ad claims moral high ground by specifying that the brand is against “toxic masculinity.” That’s fine, but who defines what toxic masculinity is? Is it beating kids up? Bullying? Fighting? Being competitive? Teasing? It isn’t obvious to me that we all draw the same line there. 
* I have a similar problem with this “boys will be boys” message. I don’t know very many people (or anyone, really) who excuses reprehensible behavior using that phrase. When I was a kid, “boys will be boys” also meant doing stupid things like jumping off the roof of a garage or skateboarding down a massive hill. Again, where is the line? Is it fighting? Bullying? Wrestling? Playing rough? Playing in risky situations? Being physical?
* Then there’s this message of men holding other men accountable. Totally onboard with that idea, as I think genuinely good people are. But the examples used in the commercial range from \[bro at frat party telling girl to smile more\] to \[guy approaching a woman in public\] to \[kids wrestling in the backyard\]. I think most reasonable people agree that the first example is rude and offensive. The other two seem like they’re judgement calls. Are men never supposed to approach women in public places? Are kids never allowed to wrestle? 

In general, the actual transcript of what’s said in the spot is very reasonable. There also seem to be some ultra-politically-correct dog whistles in it, and I think that’s what those with negative reactions are feeling. I don’t really believe that most of the men offended by this spot are against accountability for actions, bullying, or “toxic masculinity.” I just don’t think we all agree on where to draw those lines, and this ad seems to lump some behaviors into toxicity that aren’t so black and white. ",17Jan2019,1
23,"I began my post with a really angry rant. 

I decided to delete all of it and start over because I realized I don't want another online pissing match. Instead, I'll tell you a quick story about my older sister whom I love dearly and is the reason why I'm proud to call myself a feminist. It's entirely up to you if you want to take the time to read it, or brush me off as another ""one of the good ones"". 

I always thought my older sister was this awesome, invincible figure in my life. Growing up in a poor household, I didn't get many gifts from my parents, but my sister, who started working insane hours when she hit high school, would buy me incredible stuff for Christmas with the money she earned. My first trip to Disneyland was paid for by her. When I was accepted to college, she was the one who bought me my laptop and dorm necessities while my parents, doing the best they could, could just offer moral support. I think you get the idea. Basically, she was the one I could always count on.

That's why it came to me as a huge shock when she revealed to me about a year ago that she almost committed suicide. My sister always wears long sleeve shirts, and I never put two and two together, but it was to help hide the scars on her arms from all the cutting she was doing. One day, she was in the bathtub and was on the brink of cutting the veins upstream, rather than across. 

Of course, the first thing I wanted to know was, why? I assumed it was one traumatic event she had been hiding that almost broke her, but it wasn't. Rather, it was the accumulation of multiple, ""minor"" traumas on top of a recent event that almost broke her. She then proceeded to dispassionately list off all the traumatic events in her life.

- when a man publicly flashed her when she was in kindergarten
- when her fifth grade teacher called her fat because she was the tallest kid in class
- when our grandmother starved her from meals when she visited Korea, because she needed to lose weight to be more womanly 
- when her first boyfriend raped her because it was their fourth date, and ""damn time to put out""
- when she was groped by her supervisor at work, and HR did nothing about it
- and the kicker, when her most recent boyfriend committed suicide because she declined to marry him

In the end, she was just tired. Really tired of all the little and big things combined that she couldn't talk to with anybody because ""everyone else is doing fine"" and she didn't want to rock the boat. 

I asked her what changed her mind, and she said she stopped because she didn't want to scar me with that kind of pain. 

Ultimately, what I'm trying to get at here is that being a feminist does not have to be a bad thing. I'm thankful to have such a wonderful role model in my life, which undoubtedly played a huge role in making me the person I am today. I am sorry if there isn't someone in your life that could be that role model for you to help you see that feminism is a good thing for the people we love and for everyone as a whole. 

We're all going through something, and I am sure if given the chance you would love to share your story. I'd like to hear it one day, if you want to share. I can only imagine for you right now that it feels like everyone else is getting a turn to speak except you, but I hope you understand that a little empathy goes a long way. If you can let the words of your female peers reach you, the ones that are trying to tell their story of how flawed our society is right now, you'll find that when you're willing to listen to their problems, they'll be more willing to listen to you. 

My sister worked her ass off to protect me as much as she could from the horrible world poverty produced. In turn, I think it's only fair that I do my best to help protect my niece, my future kids, and my friends kids from the misogyny, double standards and assault so that they never go through what my sister did. We want to make each generation better and better so that when the inevitable heat death of the universe arrives, we'll go out hand in hand, rather than pointing fingers at who is to blame.

26,"About a week ago, I got introduced to a girl by a friend of mine. She was cool. I found out we had a lot in common during a ~40 minute bus ride, including a fondness for a game that none of my friends liked. The thing is, I think I might have come across as stuck-up in one of our last conversations. We passed by a building where she mentioned she had a summer job with a laboratory setting. It was one of those jobs that were kind of dull unless you're really interested in it. I asked how it was, she said it was fun. To which I responded, ""Really?"" in a teasing/joking tone. She said it was just a min. wage job and only for the summer, then we laughed it off. We said our goodbyes as soon as the bus reached its destination. She's in one of my classes so I was certain that we'd talk again. 

Yesterday, I was playing a game she recommended and just thought about my choice of words and specifically my tone during that part of our conversation. And now it's stuck in my head. I'm probably getting stressed over nothing. We didn't get to talk in class today, well it's more like me being too anxious to come over and say hi. Better luck next week, me!",17Jan2019,1

30,"Long story short, some baby birds hatched on the side of my house. Their nest was positioned in a way that I was worried about them falling. It was also close to our cars, so I was afraid that if one fell, someone backing out of the driveway might accidentally hit them.

To solve this problem, I thought it would be a good idea to put a little cardboard box, padded with a blanket, underneath their nest to sort of soften their landing if one were to fall. Well, one evening when I went outside to check on them, my worst fears came true. It seems one had fallen during the day. It had landed in the box, but was dead. I realize that the fall might have been what killed it, but to this day, I wonder if the fact that it was trapped in a box for several hours, with its mother likely unaware of where it was and unable to reach it for feeding, was the reason it died. I don't know why I was so stupid not to realize that the box would probably isolate it from its mother. I thought I was helping it by placing a box under the nest so that a) it would hit a soft blanket instead of the hard ground, and b) it wouldn't run off into the road or something.

I know it might sound stupid, but I still breaking down crying when I think about that little bird. I loved them so much and was constantly terrified of something bad happening to them. How ironic that I was the one that likely caused that bird's death.",17Jan2019,1

Whenever I imagined my first cold shower, I had this picture of myself sitting under the shower making weird noises and hyperventilating for the entirety of the shower period, but I have to say my first C.S. experience went as smooth as silk. I didn't hyperventilate nor did I shiver or make weird noises, In fact, it felt like I have been taking C.S.'s for a very long time. However, I didn't do what everyone here on Reddit does(just do it), I followed Wim Hof's breathing methods and went in with the focused mentality on closing my cardiovascular system in my chest area and head, now Wim says this comes with training but I felt like it works if you focus enough. I know this might sound a bit absurd but apparently, his methods are legit.

For anyone hesitating to do your first shower, here's what I did:

I turned on the cold water started with my lower body steadily and gradually went up towards my belly and finally to my upper body all while I was breathing deeply, hold your breath in for a brief moment then exhale (you can find plenty of tutorials on youtube for Wim's methods). This gave me enough time to get my self squeaky clean without putting my upper body under cold water for more than 6 minutes.

Now I am not saying anyone should do this, I know some people say what you need for the benefits is the shock, but I find most of the experts saying the exposures should be gradual and not forced.",17Jan2019,1
37,"So the only reason I’m posting this is because tonight, I believe I was able to make a breakthrough with my uncle.

Nearly 11 &amp;1/2 years later, his brother &amp; my uncle passed away &amp; my uncle is still battling with this &amp; has let alcoholism really take control of him the last few years. From drunk fits of rage, to incessant disrespectful texts to fighting with &amp; dogging his baby momma nearly everyday. Now with a little bit of context y’all will have a little better idea of why this felt so significant. Tonight I was able to catch him actually not blackout, stupid drunk. We began talking about the health of his dad/my grandfather &amp; our uncle/great uncle. My grandfather battled with alcoholism as well &amp; had two close calls with health complications due to this. We then began talking about our health &amp; all that &amp; he finally mentioned how unhealthy it was to be sleeping three hours a day &amp; spending $70-100 dollars a day on alcohol. He then said again he agreed &amp; after the conversation about this I began mentioning how awful he’s been acting towards his baby mama. After several minutes talking about that, I also mentioned how it’s been effecting our relationship. In my 20+ years of being alive he’s basically been like a father to me &amp; I told him I couldn’t hold it in anymore &amp; that what’s he’s doing is incredibly bad for his health &amp; relationship &amp; he told me if he continues doing what he has that his BM will leave &amp; he “will be dead in five years.” I told him that if he feels that bad &amp; honestly believes that, that he has to do something. Continually nodding his head &amp; agreeing, I brought up how I didn’t wanna see his son grow up without a father like myself. That really struck home with him &amp; he began to swell up &amp; tears started slowly flowing. This was the first time in months I’ve seen him in such a positive light. We also spoke about a whole slew of things from him acknowledging that he has to put his health first &amp; continuing being the amazing dad he truly is. Even with the drinking he was a great father &amp; living with him, his son, &amp; baby mama I’ve watched him become better in that aspect everyday but he promised me that he is going to start taking the necessary steps to start recovering. We hugged three, four times &amp; it was a great feeling. Hadn’t felt the connection we had my entire life in awhile so I was really put on cloud nine.

38,"I really feel like I’m putting myself out here... but here I go. I hope I placed this question in the right spot.

In my 20’s I was always around 110, I’m now 39. I’d been trying to loose weight for the past 5 years. I was 150 and my goal was/is 112. Today I reached my goal! Awesome. 

There was a lot of trial and error over the years. I learned that restricted eating and exercising together wasn’t for me personally. I was increasing in endurance, and not loosing weight. I realized I needed to loose the weight first, and that meant moderate running (which I like to do) and lowering carbs and sugars and being mindful about portions. I also quit drinking calories, including most alcohol. Also important, my goal is to gain another 10-15 back in muscle mass. So it’s not just about the weight or the number. I want to be healthy, fit, and strong. 

I’ve started to integrate strength training back into my routine. I’d like to strengthen my core and add muscle to my arms. My legs are good I can run for miles. 

Now my problem. I’ve suffered from PTSD for the past 20 years. My doctor last year put me on Valium. For the first time in my life (past 20 years), no night terrors, panic attacks, fear of falling asleep, and I’m off 4 other meds, which I also believe has helped me loose the weight. 

And here’s the but... I’ve also noticed that the Valium is making the strength training feel IMPOSSIBLE!!! I could rep weights far better before (being overweight) - and I know it’s the med doing this. Valium is a muscle relaxant. I’m frustrated. I am slowly tapering the Valium too BTW, and I’m not on a high dose. Nonetheless, it feels like another obstacle that I wasn’t anticipating, and it’s stressing me out. My doctor fully supports what I’m doing. I really do feel good. I’ve just never wanted to be truly “healthy” by my own personal standards, which I define as biopsychosocial - and physical! 

Any suggestions, personal advice, alternatives to weights for strength training, personal experiences that have worked for others, when loosing weight then building muscle. Looking for feedback and hearing successes from others - knowing that it’s different for everyone. We are all wired and designed differently - Still, with a community this big, I’m hoping to hear some encouraging stories!! Not the kind of stories that promote “fads”, “fitspiration” and that stuff... rather, true lifestyle changes! Thanks. ",17Jan2019,1
39,"So, you have probably seen a makeover movie or two, personally I've seen a lot of them. I used to love them, mostly because I was that girl. I was all about biology, geography, history and medicine. I was obsessed with dinosaurs and with the human body (so much I became a hypochondriac later in life, I'm good now though), I would use most of my time reading or watching documentaries - when I wasn't playing barbie with my little sisters. When I played with barbies I would make up these huge fantasy lands, making up epic tales as I go - every part of the bedroom had a purpose, I loved every minute of it. I didn't have to many friends though, as I was very socially awkward and I picked fights over friends as I didn't really let things go when I knew  (or thought I knew) the facts.   


Anyways, to my blessing and curse Iamverysmart - and very beautiful. I started modelling at 14, hoping I would meet some new friends. I met a girl who would later become my best friend, except for her, I didn't really fit in. I tried to be just pretty, I suffocated on my own words of interest so many times - most people in fashion rarely care about anything but themselves. In retrospective - I should never have been there in the first place (though the industry seriously needs girls like me). At 14 I had never kissed a boy, but I was posing in lace underwear. I had been experimenting with makeup before (seriously experimented, mixing textures and trying to make new kinds of makeup) - now I was sitting for hours in a chair getting my face fixed. I never felt more wanted, and never felt less beautiful. So I changed. I started dressing up - it usually ended up looking (lack of a better word) slutty and just too much, I was approaching clothes like costumes. I became obsessed with my looks - and my weight. I was bullied for being a stick in school and told that smoking cigarettes would make me thinner by the industry. I started smoking and partying , but that nerdy girl never left my side, she just got suppressed by alcohol and later by weed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am 23 now. I'm still modelling, but for fast cash - I have lost all ambition and have no need to pursue that life. And honestly, I have never been happier. I'm giving myself a reverse makeover - I'm taking back my inner nerd, I'll never be cool anyways. My sense of style is becoming more sober - to say the least, I no longer feel the need to show off every part of my body, in fact I am covering up and feeling very comfortable with that. A year ago I shaved my head, I miss having long hair (rip ponytails), but it was so, so worth it - not being conventionally beautiful taught me a lot. I have become very interested in literature, language, the human psyche and neuroscience (light). I am reading books again after a break of 6 years and they are turning out to be the best of friends. I am very happy as I said, but very lonely. I need a lot of alone time and I isolate myself to learn and indulge in all my interests. I am also very picky with friends - I'm learning though, I'm no longer socially awkward - just awkward (but I'm turning into a people person - it's really weird)..  


Becoming myself is the greatest project I've set out for yet and I hope I inspire you all to do the same. It is worth it - no matter how lame or weird (or cool) you think you are - dig deep and dig yourself out! It is so worth it - it's the closest to freedom I've felt!

58,"Throw away account. I could really use some good advices upon this so please, be gentle.

I recently found out that my nephew was sexually abused for at least a month. I won't go in for details as it would be too painful for me, so long story short: it was his uncle, who is my brother-in-law (BIL) younger brother. The boy didn't told me it was him, but I'm very good at extracting informations it's not that hard to get a child to talk to you, especially if you're close enough to him.

So, I was raged, but I took time to consider options. Then I told his mother, who is my elder sister, about his situation. She was denial at first, but then admitted that there're ""signals that she barely noticed"". To be cleared, he's temporarily living with them at that moment as he was jobless and homeless a few months before.

 She then called her husband, and we took him to doctors. They confirmed that there was sign of semen in his anus, we were all furious, and both parents were immediately summoned. The boy got to speak up for himself, but clearly he was scared, so he made little sound to his words. The asshat's parents immediately put the blame on my head, as I am gay and stated that their son had nothing to do with it, it was me who was the asshole. Needless to say, this really turned the table. I am indeed gay, my nephew's parents both knew it because I came out to them before they even had their first child (8 years old now, beautiful sweetheart). They never told anybody, but the in-law family still found out because that asshole ""accidentally"" slip the words out. Back then they requested that I stay away from their granchildren mutiple times, both to me and I sister, and on mutiple occasions they humaliated me and my parents for having ""such a sick bastards"". My parents even rejected me for being gay, so this wasn't unfamiliar at all.

The point is, when the gun was pointed at me every one looked me suspiciously, even my sister. All I thought of that moment was how poor my nephew was, and how he could grow up with this mark on his mind. So I just leaf, not before requesting a DNA test. Also I demanded that my nephew be kept away from that monster, and when my sister and her husband hesitated to do so I declared that if they ignored my demand then when the result was out, I would do everything in my capability to keep their child away from them. From what I gathered, they still let that monster shared the same roof with my nephew, also with his parents, while my parents was ""asked"" to leave and find a motel to stay. (I invited them to my place, but they refused.) They took the sample to the hospital on Thursday, so we had to wait until next Monday to get the result. The asshole disappeared on Sunday, nơwhere to be found.

My sister contacted me that evening, saying that she's sorry, and asked for us to meet. I was still at rage, so I said we would meet tomorrow, at the hospital. Needless to say about the result, and I told my sister that right then I would go to local police to report this, and would also contact child care to temporarily take care of her son. She begged me to wait and let her decided what to do, and though she promised me there would be heavily punishment, I leaf without saying anything.

That was 8 hours ago. She's been trying to contact me since, but my only answer was ""no matter what, if your child who lives under your nose get this kind of assault without you knowing anything about it, then you are the most guilty"". I discuss this with my bf, he supported whatever I decided to do, but also said that I should give my nephew's parents a chance, since they're both good parents. Not so good from my point of view, but I fear that we might loose the boy as he would most certainly not pe put under me and my bf's care (my orientation isn't healthy in many eyes), and if my sister loose him he would be sent to a foster house. I never want that to happen, so I decided to look for advices from stranger. 

That asshole is going to pay, there's nothing to discuss about that. But what I am going to do with my nephew? Let his parents fix their fault, or give him a new start?

59,"I was in a long distance relationship and about three months into the relationship, my girlfriend came to meet me in the city I was living and while we were on the way to a date night, I saw her texting an ex in the cab, who she was definitely hung up on (for about 4 years) at least 8 months before the relationship and after I saw her texting him, I felt bad about it and so I just kept my feelings to myself and got quiet.  
Seeing that I don’t like it and I am slightly angry and sad, she turned around the conversation in such a way that at the end I had to apologise for the way I was feeling while that ex was asking her to meet him. She didn’t meet him btw.

I was told that I am being too sensitive and stupid and not able to understand that there is nothing there.

When we were breaking up, I brought this incident forward and she took a couple of days and sort of justified what she did back then by saying that  
“We can’t blame our past selves for the knowledge and wisdom our present self has” but my point is that you can atleast own up to it and at the least without any caveat, just apologise about it.

She hasn’t done it by the way by herself, I had to bring it up again and again and only after saying that at least apologise, that she did.

Am I being overly sensitive here?

Was it wrong for me to feel what I felt?

I just want to ensure that I am thinking straight.

64,"So this might seem like a small issue, but it's causing me quite a bit of anxiety. And it seems to have been building over the past several years. Curious if others are experiencing this.   


I'm finding it more and more difficult to actually sit down and read a book, finish the book, and (if it's a series) continue with the next one. One of the problems seems to be that I lose interest too quickly; not just in the book I'm reading, but in the genre. Example: earlier this month it was all about urban fantasy thriller/mystery. And then, literally over night, it became novels of more literary value set in places like Africa, India, and SE Asia (basically post-colonial stuff; think Achebe, Mistry, Adichie, etc.) The other major thing that happens is I'll land on a genre, and then want to find the \*absolute best and most important books\* from that genre, and so I keep searching around, mining Goodreads for lists and more lists. I also often end up buying a bunch of books that never get read. 

I remember when I was younger, back in the 1990s and early 2000s, I could pick a single book, read it, and then move on to another book. I'd wake up in the morning and just pick up, for example, ""The Physician"" by Noah Gordon, and just spend all morning reading it. I loved being able to get completely into a book, but that level of immersiveness is very elusive now. Now I wake up and use the internet all morning (like I'm doing NOW), often to do more ""research"" on the books I could and should be reading. It seems that books have become this big massive project. I can't just read a book, I have to turn it into a massive process of picking one out, reading the reviews, thinking about whether it's THE one I should start with, and so forth. I can't remember the last time I just sat and read for a few hours (maybe it was Game of Thrones?)  


Anyone else have this issue? Do you think the internet and the constant distractions are to blame? Or maybe the ease with which we can find more and more stuff, such as endless lists of books? Maybe the constant choices take away our ability to just accept what we have in front of us.",17Jan2019,1

So I restarted the lab and tried again, taking twice as long to make sure I didn't fuck anything up. Still failure.

Frustrated, tired, and in pain (chronic pain makes everything worse) I started again and still failed. At this point I had to submit the lab (which was due) and told the professor I had no clue what went wrong.

69,"Ever since coming to college, I haven’t really made any lasting friendships besides with one person who never initiates hanging out. I am in a long distance relationship as well so it’s been very lonely.

My first semester, something so small could set me off into a spiral. I would hear people laughing outside on a weekend and I would cry myself to sleep wondering why my efforts to make friends haven’t worked. I would end up having a major breakdown once a week with crying spurts on other days. I became less motivated and it took a lot of effort to go to the clubs I was in. The only social outlet I had were clubs, but nothing ever left the club room. I was alone most days and I would shift between happiness and depression. My thoughts at that time were really dark and I losing hope. I felt that with each passing day I was losing out on experiencing the joys of college and that I would look back on my time with regret.

On the start of the new semester, I decided to try harder. I’m being friendlier to people around me, I’m taking the initiative more, I put more effort into my appearance. I even decided to try and join a social sorority to make friends. I’m even thinking about therapy. And I feel a change. For the first time ever I ate lunch with someone else, I got invited into group chats, people actually say hi to me. While I don’t have someone to be with on weekends, I feel progress.

Today in the elevator, a girl told me about how she was out bowling until 1am last night. Last semester I would’ve broken down about how I was wasting my time on YouTube alone until 1am, but I barely even feel jealousy now. I don’t want to fall back into that pit I was in before.

70,"I usually try to keep my thoughts on here positive and uplifting but it is becoming readily apparent that a vast majority of Facebook users are in desperate need of a reality check. There are times where I want to believe that we are in the disco era of social media, in that we will look back on this time decades from now and say, “What the heck were we thinking?” But something has gone horribly wrong. I think it all started when people started putting any funny saying like “Mommy needs wine” along with the minions from *Despicable Me* when the two have nothing to do with each other. Or they put a famous picture of an actor like Sam Elliott with a quote he has never said in real life. Maybe they think a comment on how people are “special kind of stupid” has more weight if it looks like it is coming from a grizzled old cowboy.   

But now things are taking a strange turn. The Clemson quarterback had to publically come out and say the quote attributed to him about the White House visit never happened. The Rock has to come out and say the “snowflake” article never happened. People forward and share that stuff because it furthers the narrative they want to tell but all it is doing is adding to the cacophony of the echo chamber.

National Enquirer, Inc., Burnett was one of the few celebrities who went after tabloids for punitive damages and “actual malice” when they alleged she was having an affair with the Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.

72," **(Originally posted to** r/ImposterSyndrome **an hour or so ago, but that sub might be dead, so I cross-posted to **r/askpsychology** and here.  I calmed down quite a bit while writing this post, and I no longer feel as though I am actively in crisis.  I am feeling a bit numb, and I am still unsure what to do, or if I should seek professional help as I process this information.  I am hoping that this post and any potential responses I receive will help me convince myself that it is real.)**



**Original Post:**

## I think I am having a very real breakdown right now.

Let me start by saying I am a 31 year old female. I was feeling incredibly anxious this morning, so much so that I thought I was going to have an anxiety attack, so I called out of work. Not the first time, also not a big deal, my boss was awesome and told me to feel better soon. My boyfriend left for work, and I went into a full fledged anxiety attack. For the first time, I recorded my voice and talked aloud about the feelings I was feeling, and how I have always felt like I don't deserve anything I have from my (relatively) healthy body, to my incredible boyfriend, to my ridiculously easy job that everyone says I am amazing at (they also say that my job is NOT easy, but we'll get to that).

It was the first time in my life I had ever said those things aloud. As I was saying it aloud I became paranoid that my neighbors/landlord would hear me saying those crazy things and find grounds to kick me out of my beautiful apartment. There is ABSOLUTELY NO LOGICAL WAY that they could hear. I finished up the recording in a whisper and started pacing around wildly, then, out of nowhere, I jokingly accused myself of having Imposter Syndrome. I vaguely remember talking about it in one of my Psych classes in college, and it was a hashtag joke/humble brag that I had heard before too. Then it dawned on me... Maybe I do have it. I read most of the Wikipedia article, sobbing hysterically and pausing multiple times to pace around and scream into pillows.

I have felt like an imposter since I first went to Kindergarten. I have a really good memory (OR SO OTHER TELL ME, I DON'T BELIEVE IT) and I remember not feeling this way before Kindergarten, but constantly after. I am freaking out at the idea that I may not actually be an imposter. I don't think that I deserve even the DIAGNOSIS of Imposter Syndrome, I mean, other people must have it worse than me, I don't probably have it that bad, or I am just trying to get attention.... WHICH ARE ALL THOUGHTS INDICATIVE OF THE SYNDROME. I feel like I have been on the lam my whole life and just found out no one has been looking for me. ~~I'm worried I'm overreacting~~ &lt;--- I have typed this at least 15 times so far, then deleted it. I am in full fledged crisis right now going back and forth between realizing I may not be an imposter and accusing myself of faking Imposter Syndrome.

I am not a danger to myself, I will not harm myself. But I am definitely in crisis. The half of me that is still convinced that I am faking this will not let me reach out to my boyfriend or my state's mental health hotline. The other half of me needs to calm the fuck down and it seems as though the best way to do this is to lean in to it by talking about it. I am SO SCARED THAT I WILL BE FOUND OUT that I created a throwaway email address on my boyfriend's computer (not my computer) to start this throwaway reddit account with so that their is the lowest chance of anyone knowing it is me. I'm going to be brave against my better judgement and tell you all that I even put the grammatical error in my throwaway reddit username to even further mask myself, as I am known in my personal life for proof-reading and proper grammar and anyone who actually knew me would never suspect it is me. That being said, I will not proof read this post, as I am struggling too hard to get it out, and proofreading it may make me change my mind about posting it.

I have also felt like an imposter in EVERY aspect of my life since I was 6 years old, not just at school, or at work. I have felt like I cannot be my parent's child, that I must have been switched at birth. I have even refused to take those genealogy tests just in case it is discovered that I'm not theirs (I look exactly like a combination of both my parents). I am constantly talking about my problems, feelings and my ex-husband with my boyfriend (I am in absolute awe that he does not dump me due to this) because I cannot believe that he can still love me despite my flaws and divorced status, and I keep trying to show him what a faker I am so that he can go find someone who DESERVES how amazing he is. He listens like a saint, holds me as I cry and just tells me that he hopes someday I can see myself how he sees me, and that he isn't going anywhere. I try to tell him that it isn't low self esteem, I am genuinely just tricking him into staying with me because I love him and selfishly don't want him to be unhappy and leave me. So I try to make him as happy as possible. He has tried to tell me, ""That is what love is!"" and ""Everyone feels that way sometimes!"", but... there is just no way.

I am currently ""happier"" than I have ever been in my whole life. And I am starting to implode from the pressure of maintaining the facade that I deserve anything I have. In the past few months, I have started to sabotage my relationship by drinking too much and getting into bullshit arguments with my boyfriend, who is SO AMAZING that he just tells me the next morning that he knows I am going through something right now and he wants to help me through it the best he can. I have started lying about things being done at work that aren't FOR NO REASON. Like, I could tell my boss that the things haven't even been started yet, and it would be fine. But I lie. My boss is so kind and amazing, she literally brought me presents yesterday for no reason. I have bills *that I have the money to pay* in default, and creditors are calling me every day. I ignore them. One of these bills is for $8. Eight fucking dollars. I'm paralyzed about it. I won't fix it. These are only a few aspects of my life as examples. I do not have any friends, I pushed them all away after my divorce, and I actively avoid new friendships. I mean, I have coworkers that have BEGGED me to come to parties they were having. I lie about having other plans. I deserve to have my life fucked up. I don't deserve the amazing relationships and things I have, and it's only a matter of time before everyone finds that out and takes it away from me anyway. At least if I sabotage it myself it will be on my terms.

I don't know what to do. I don't know who I am. I am elated one minute, realizing that I can start to grow now, then I am terrified I'm faking it, then I am gut-wrenchingly depressed about all of the potential time and energy and LIFE I have wasted thinking that I am a fraud, then I berate myself again for faking it... It feels like my whole world is upside down.

If you have read this far, thank you. I know that this subreddit is super small and appears to be dead, but I had to write this. The wikipedia page said that the realization that others have this syndrome is a huge part of coping with it.

This is the first day of my life. Maybe I will be brave and cross-post this, but I don't know to where. I already saved a copy of this to my boyfriend's desktop, which is braver than I was when I started typing. I feel like I'm getting braver by the minute, throwing open the windows in my mind and letting the truth stream in like the sun.

* I'm not an imposter.
* I'm not faking everything I do.
* I hope that someday soon I will believe the two sentences above this one.

**EDIT:  I ended on a happy note, then went right back to doubting myself again, and now I feel numb and exhausted.  I am concerned that if I take a nap or try to focus on anything else that I will settle back into denial, self-sabotage and believing that I am faking this, which will mean that nothing will change.  I am hoping that this post will remind me that Imposter Syndrome is real, and that I (might) have it.  Any advice is appreciated, however I think what I truly need is validation.  People telling me that it is possible I have Imposter Syndrome.  People saying that they have it, or have seen it before, and that I am exhibiting symptoms of it.  Please understand that I am not asking for a diagnosis.  It seems inevitable that (if I manage to keep myself convinced it is real) I will end up seeking psychological help eventually for this.  This is ground-zero of the truthbomb that just exploded in my head.  I just need to know that this could be real.**



**EDIT 2: If anyone has any suggestions of where else I could cross-post this, please let me know.  I hope that it isn't against reddit rules for me to say that I am hoping to get as many responses as possible, given the circumstances.**

75,"I don't have any predisposition to schizophrenia or any major mental illness, (well, alcoholism/addiction runs in the fam).      

I just remembered having a vivid memory, age 6-7, laying in my bed for *hours*, watching opaque screens appear in my vision, staring at what they projected. Imagine the reflection of the TV against glass. It was like loads of screens over my vision similar to how you'd see the screen reflections in that way, slightly covering your vision.  
I specifically remember watching a golfing tournament through the ""screen"", and when I'd close my eyes I'd get a completely different ""screen"" that would cover my entire vision. I also specifically remember seeing futuristic race cars flying past each other in a video game style. I remember it wasn't unsettling to watch whatsoever, just annoying to be unable to sleep. I don't know how long it lasted for, likely 1-5 hours. I truly believe I hallucinated this as opposed to having a dream, it just all seems so incredibly memorable and real. I remember another time I was spooked by similar hallucinations at age 4, but honestly, it could be a false memory.    

So, anyone else out there have an experience like this? I've never had any sort of psychotic episode, only really hallucinating from psychedelic drugs in the past.

So I checked the device activity page. I found 14 recently used devices (iPad's, TV's, Desktops, phones) across 3 IP addresses. Three of the devices and 1 IP were mine. One of the other IP's was my sister.

From what I can gather (because my sister isn't being very forward), she gave the password to a friend, who took it home and shared it with her roommates. So there was a whole different household using my account.

I don't know why they waited so long to make a 3rd user.

Anyway. I was just reading a top post over on /r/AskMen about bisexual men and their dating lives. I know mine as a woman, but I got really excited/curious about bi men being with other men. I'll admit I'm into gay porn and all that. It's hot. But I'd never really stopped to think about the dynamics. And then I did while reading this post. And suddenly I got really sad about the fact that I'll never get to experience male gay sex. And I found myself really wanting it. Not that I'm suddenly like realizing I'm trans and want to be a man (though I am fairly masculine as opposed to being feminine). But it just was such an odd thought process and sensation.

Told me to runaway from things I don’t know about. Avoiding discomfort. My fears told me that there’s a such thing as an negative emotion but that’s wrong. We develope negative thoughts about the emotions  we have. Humans are meant to feel. No matter if it’s sadness or happiness, the feeling is meant to be there so we can experience life. I was missing out because I was numb. Now I see that Being quiet nowadays is just an old scar from an old curse. I have no reason to be silent anymore, there’s nothing to learn from it. Silence just allows me to feel at home. I don’t want stay home anymore, I want to grow.

There's no need to damage yourself by forcing yourself to fit into one thing. Why engage with the sunk cost fallacy? Just cut your losses and stop before the damage it does to you is irreparable. Go home. Recover. Figure yourself out. There's no shame in it. Burn outs are a real thing. ",17Jan2019,1

88,"In no way do I think I have depression or am sad. I probably don’t have any mental issue, at least nothing diagnosed, nor would I acknowledge if I’m insecure. However, I seek to find my talent. That, or debunk the statement that everyone has a a talent. While I’m not saying I’m shit at everything, but I’m mediocre at best with most things in the world. While naturally that should make me disbelieve in whether everyone is talented, I’ve seen that among everyone around me, starting from my family, where my eldest sisters a great singer, my other sister can draw portraits with excellence, even my brother, who despite being 8 years my senior and still living with my parents,  is a superb driver and has great knowledge with cars. Both my parents where objectively talented, my mom was top in Gymnastics while my dad is a respected author among other things like poetry etc. All my friends had several talents each, both the ones I grew up with and the ones I met since moving to Uni. 

Me here, I’m just there, I can get things done, I pass all my shit and all but still have nothing too unique to be proud about. I play video games but I’m quite incompetent at them, I’m not afraid to express my opinion in public but I can never grab their attention, I tried making memes but failed terribly. I can talk to girls, and I have gotten lucky a couple of times, but have I ever had a girlfriend? Not even close.

While I don’t feel unconfident, but I always find everyone having something special but never me, I mean I have friends but even my only best friend doesn’t consider me his best friend, rather one of his, what he likes to say, close 5. All my other friends, they don’t put too much effort in maintaining our bond, I mean I always had the duty of strengthening my friendships once they got to know me, because once I don’t they’ll drift away and I become indifferent to them. Holy shit, I even find myself doing that with my siblings now that I moved out. I find it impossible to inspire other, I make friends but they quickly lose interest. The two types of friends I had are either introverts who want to appear sociable in front of others using me, or people that I help with school stuff, I mean I’m never automatically invited to anything, I have to ask if there’s anything happening. The only person that I struggle to understand why he actually seems to care about me is my bestirring I mentioned earlier, I mean even if he doesn’t put the effort of a bestfriend he does put the effort of a friend for a reason I’m not sure of, nor is he. My parents often told me when I was younger that I have this “thing” and it will be greatly expressed once I’m in Uni, but here I am, nothing special really, none bad, none good, just there.

89,"I'm honestly pissed off right now. This one 8th grader on my bus told my ex best friend to go overdose. And the funny thing is, we just had two days of SOS (Signs of suicide) at school this same week. For him to tell someone, that's younger than him, to kill themselves is fucked up. I told the 8th grader that he can go fuck himself under his moms bed then I told the bus driver and got off the bus. 

The thing that pissed me off was, I was the only one who stood up for her. Everyone else that heard just kept quiet or laughed. Should I tell the principal tomorrow? I know other people heard what he said so that's my proof on my part.

92,"I guess I'm going through what might be considered a midlife crisis, but I've been going through it for decades now. Well before I reached the middle of my life. I didn't get to make the best use of my youth, see, and ever since I graduated college I've been wishing I could go back and try again. 

&amp;#x200B;

But recently I've actually been asking people about it, and they tell me at my age it's too late to do the things I wish I could've done in my 20s. And that I should see a therapist to figure out what to do with my need to have had these life experiences. Problem with that though, I've already been to therapy before. And I've got family that's been to therapy. Maybe we're just the unlucky ones and all of our therapists were bad, but what I've seen of therapy is this: It can't make you happy again. If your dream was to, say, be an architect. And you can never be an architect. A therapist can't help you find equal fulfillment elsewhere. All a therapist can do is try and strengthen you so you can cope with not being a therapist. Or convince you that other jobs will do. And if you insist that you *must* be an architect? A really bad therapist will accuse you of ""regressing"" and ""not letting yourself be helped."" Because therapy only works if you let it.

&amp;#x200B;

What I know of therapy is that it's more like corrective behavior drilling. And that's not natural. But if you really wanna be ""fixed,"" even if by force, then therapy is probably for you.",17Jan2019,1

"" To which I responded "" I wanna know what is happening in my country and the world"" , sometimes when standing next to teacher I stand in attention :/.  And I always have this serious stare ( a classmate said it scares her ) people ask me "" do you ever smile""

I've been in and out of hospitals for suicide, I've got scars on my left arm, and a mind that has been shattered to the point to where I've lost a good amount of my memories... However, I still find myself looking her up on social media, not messaging her, just checking up on her, and every time I see her, it's like my heart drops. During the 5 years I spent in pain, I also spent doing a lot of stupid things, but also at the same time, I was trying to improve myself for her, I went to therapy, I got on the right medications, and I spent half a decade trying to become what I should have been for her: a boyfriend. I learned to have more empathy, I learned to listen, I learned to be the best I could be, but it wasn't enough, she found someone else and is happy with him, she also views me as a monster and won't give me the time of day to prove otherwise.

95,"I've been really unhappy for the last 2 or 3 years of my life. I've experienced weight gain (heaviest I've ever been), severe depression, terrible loneliness, and even suicidal thoughts and tenancies. I went through some really dramatic changes - moving across the country, getting married, getting a desk job, etc. 

For a few years, I literally just woke up, went to work, came home, and went to sleep. No social life, no hobbies, nothing. I lived for my marriage, which hasn't even really been that happy (for me, anyway). I started eating like garbage, I guess in a way it was just coping with the feelings of loneliness I felt. 

I'm finally in a position to think about myself. I make great money at a job that I love, and I have the flexibility to start being more intentional about how I spend my time. Last year, I started implementing self-care into my every day life, and I feel better than I ever have. 

I want 2019 to be even more intentional. I think that each and every one of us has the opportunity to truly become the kind of person we always dreamed of being. Each day is kind of a new opportunity to lean in one direction or another. I want to plan my steps. I want to become something that I'm proud of, and create a life that I love.

I don't want to miss out on any more of my own life.

101,"so, I got this public transport pass. It's in a green holder. Around mid december I drop it somewhere and nobody hands it in, so I order a new one. I get my new one a week later and I put it in a purple holder.

I got a stupid coat, nice and big but with shitty pockets.

So, one evening after work, I go visit a friend. This is the beginning of January, maybe a couple of weeks after I got the new purple pass? Im super careful with the new one, keep it in a zipped pocket all the time. But I'm excited to go see my friend so as I get on the bus, I just slip it in my pocket so i can get on my phone to let my friend know I'm on my way.

 On my way home I cant find it, check everywhere, nope. I try to find out where they might have handed it in if I dropped it in the bus. After calling a few numbers I'm told to go to the bus garage. A train ride and a bus ride later, a lot of worrying and it's there. I found it. The bus driver found it and kept it and I got it back! Im so relieved.

That was last last monday. the 7th. 

On sunday, the 13th. I go out for dinner with friends. Go home after a good time, go bed, tomorrow work. I wake up - Monday...urgh. Put my stuff together, check quickly for my money card before I get out the door and..its not there? No problem..maybe its in another pocket, or another bag...or another pocket...or shet I'm late for work.

So i go work, and I try to call the restaurant I was at, maybe I dropped it there.... but no found. So i think maybe i dropped it in the train station on my way home. I consider calling, or going there to find out but I'm tired from work and from freshly losing my bus pass. So I cancel the card..That was this monday.

It's strange to walk around without a card that gives out money, but its been ok. Then today, thursday. After the public transport pass loss I had decided enough with the pockets and I had tied the pass around my neck on a chain. A cheap chain I found at home until I could find something more proper.

I get on the train and arrive at the station at work. Open my coat to get my pass out and the chain is open and the pass is nowhere. I'm already late for work. Still I stay and a work colleague is there who talks too much and is just way too intense. I leave my number, they say they'll contact the train and call me. They also contact the station I came from but no one's handed anything in.

I go work..I get on with things...I wait for the phone to ring...I worry about how I'm going to get home because I dont have a pass and I dont have money card either (Which can also be used)...

Finally, somehow, the card was found and someone had contacted my dad to say they got it.

I get home after work (borrowing my super intense colleague's bank card and getting ""told off"" by colleagues for losing my shet all the time and for using a shitty chain - like i had been frolicking about all day. I know its not their intention but I'm so angry just thinking about it again)

I get home and here is my pass. I'm so tired. I just went to my room and cried and I dont even know why.

My bank card also arrived in the post, just needs to be activated.

I'm so tired. I just want to do nothing tomorrow. I might call in sick. Plus it's my birthday.

So in a month, I lost my bus pass three time and my debit card once. I dont even know if there's a name for it. I'm just really tired and I dont trust myself anymore. I want to stay home and be safe.

If you read up to here. Thank you. I hope it was an entertaining tale. I couldnt make it more interesting or exciting. I just needed to say it out loud so I can stop thinking about it.
