0,"It sucks to admit this, but I still feel happy to see him. We’ve been divorced for two years and he was in an affair for 3 out of our 5 years married. He started living with his mistress immediately afterwards, and married her shortly after. 

But me....I thought a lot. 

We were friends for over half our lives. We got married and even though we fought sometimes, I thought the sun shone out of his arse. We were like-minded, popular people in our circles. He could do no wrong in my mind...so I began taking anxiety medication when I started finding the messages late at night. I thought my jealousy and paranoia were toxic and the medication would help. “It was a friend who needed to vent”, was all it was, he said. So I made that my truth. Fast forward years, and I continued to feel uneasy. Her name kept appearing in his phone. He’d say unusual things to me. He started staying away “at work” later and later. He responded angrily at my requests for help with our child. He wouldn’t help move houses when it was time. We became roommates essentially. 

I began really feeling hurt when he would only have sex from behind...he would never look at my face. It killed me. In the final 8 months, we had sex twice, and he has a very high drive. He also gave me HPV years after being clean, which should have been the final sign for me. But he was telling the truth in my mind-after all, why wouldn’t I trust the man I loved?

It finally collapsed the day before my birthday. He asked to leave-and I fell apart. I begged him to stay, begged him for counseling. I was so hurt he refused; why wouldn’t he do the same for me that I was willing to do for him?

When it finally all came out about his affair, he was upset at me for being angry and venting to my family and friends. He changed completely and was not the man I knew. He looks for every opportunity to take our son from me, and no longer abides by the civil agreement in our decree.  He’s become a bigot. We don’t even agree about child-rearing anymore. 

I thought about everything he’d said over the course of our marriage-every word he said to manipulate my thoughts or make me feel bad about myself.  What I still can’t fathom is why he was so terrible to me after us having what I thought was a near-perfect relationship.  The lies and manipulation were RAMPANT looking back. Sometimes I still stay up at night thinking about what I did wrong. 

I’ve had therapy and it took an extremely long time to begin healing. But I’ve never put it all out there before, and now that I’ve written it out....I feel a bit better. I love the internet. Thanks all.",17May2019,15

3,"A great human was lost this mother's day. A mother who bore several of her own children. Then through nothing but love cared for over two hundred children born by others. Children who's parents could not, would not, or were taken by the state be cared for. She took them in provided clothing, shelter, food, a warm bed and most importantly love and safety. Then in the early 80s she went a step further. She started to adopt. On top of having four of her own. She adopted. She passed with 9 children, five who were not her own blood and with over a dozen grandchildren. She wasn't given headlines. She wasnt given awards. She was given love for all the love she gave. I ask that in light of all the awful things we as people do and deal with, we remember this wonderful woman. I will. She was my mother.",17May2019,12
5,"I feel like I'm losing my mind right now. I'm a hard person to break and I'm at my limit. I dont know if this belongs here, I'm sorry and I'll remove it if it doesnt, I just the sub while scrolling through.

This is lengthy and it starts here: I'm getting married in t months. This is going to be the happiest day of my life. I get to finally marry the girl of my dreams and live my life with her. Her parents, haven't been the kindest to me in the past, but the past 2 years have been working on making it up to me, and I forgive them. I really do. Her dad actually adores me for how I treat his daughter. 

Flash forward to now, anything to do with them, my mom is completely against.  Actually slanders them. Talks how they are horrible people (and they really arent they were just misguided.) A couple of fight over the last year later, and we come to last night. We have a newborn from my fiancee's sister, that we want to carry our rings down the aisle ( probably on a string or something) and guess who the only person that keep this baby calm is? My fiancee's mom. So who would walk the baby down the aisle? The obvious choice.

Now we break this decision to my mom, and she start talking about how she and my dad are going to be helping pay as much as they can (while her parents have opted out of doing for personal reasons) and that if we do that, we are putting a parent who doesnt want to help at all in the spotlight, which my mom says she doesnt deserve. When all we want is for the baby to be calm and happy while he comes down the aisle.

She have an argument, she tells me I dont always have to see my fiancee as innocent and I should start seeing her side, I walk out to cool down and I drive home. I start getting texts making it obvious that I should feel bad. She calls me and tells me that she knows for a fact that she is not in the wrong in any way.

Now guys this is our wedding. We never asked for any money from them, and they really want to help. I'm starting to actually think I'm in the wrong here and I needed to vent. She calls me and tells me about how everyone in her house are so mad at us, how wrong we are to treat them like a dog. She texts to see say how depressed she is from this situation,  and this happens after every argument she cant win. My own brother who is younger than me has threatened me that I better not make our mom cry any more. Guys please, am I crazy? Am I insane for defending my future wife. Or for agreeing that it is no harm for a baby to be carried down an aisle? It's never about us. It's about their feelings. Not ours.",17May2019,0
6,"***State Of Mind***: We are all a sum of our life experiences. How we process those experiences and use that knowledge sets us apart from each other.

## The Mind

The mind is a muscle of connections that process at a million times per second. The brain only functions by a set of ideas. Those ideas govern the intention to follow religions, career paths, basically your daily needs and want. All beautiful programmed into your mind from birth. I don't believe humanity was created to work 9 to 5, look forward to 2 weeks of holidays, and then die! There are things hidden from us on purpose to keep us suppressed and under control to flow through a system designed to keep us slaved to their set of ideas. We never had a chance!

Then when most of us ask ourselves, ""What's our purpose in life?"" How can you ask a rat in a cage maze, whose objective is to find and get the cheese that very question? Humanity is off track and has been for thousands of years.

For the majority of the population, the mind is in control of them, instead of the people being in control of their thoughts and actions! The reason they're not in power is due to 'fear' and 'insecurity'. The Mind creates fear, which doesn't exist. It's a figment of our imagination. Insecurity stems from an incorrect set of ideas planted in our minds to give rise to doubt. Again, I call this a false positive.

So many of us walk away from a potential love, best friend or opportunity because we let our mind take over! Majority of people don't go about their life, trusting their gut/intuition. If we did, we'd be a lot happier. Driven, and at peace. Then people say, ""I can't find my soulmate!"" Well, that's because most people are not connected to there souls.

## FREQUENCY/VIBRATION

So what are we all connected to, if not our souls? We are all connected to everything around us and everything around us is connected to us, but we don't know how to communicate back and forth. Everything has a frequency in which it vibrates. That vibration has a unique signature, which sets us apart from everyone! So when someone creepy comes into your vibration, their energy signature conflicts with yours and your gut sends out a strong vibe! Same scenario, but its someone special and your vibes are getting you excited, but then your mind takes over, bringing in doubt. And most people walk away not realizing something special was about to happen.

Our consciousness and subconsciousness are not connected. This is not the case for everyone, but it is for the majority of people. The subconsciousness control 95% of our brain. It has power and abilities we haven't tapped into or know how to yet. There is a reason why we can't remember our dreams. Have you ever had a Deja Vu? If so, that was you traveling into the future, via ***Astro Traveling*** while you were dreaming, which means that your energy/spirit went into the future and back. And that when you in your present day, came across that same timeline you visited in your dream, a 2 to 3 seconds notification in your mind, alerts you of that. And you realize that it's true, but can't make sense of what's happening or understand why. That feelings only last about 5 mins, and then fades away! Showing you a sneak peek into the power of your energy and subconsciousness.

## WHERE ARE WE HEADED?

Look around you, and what do you see, in terms of people and their behaviors? Mental Health Issues are at an all-time high. Anxiety is at an all-time high. People are communicating less and less, and changing their way of communication to shorter and shorter words, is a sign of humanity on a decline and the age of humanoids becoming a new term!

There are more single parents than ever, based on my research of over 3000 couples in the last year! Yes, they shared, why the relationships ended, and I looked for common denominators that connected the threads of the same inline topics; such as 'single parents'.

There are a lot of great authors out there, doing a great job, trying to raise the vibrations within people so that they find their authentic self. Tap into their higher frequency that brings them focus, peace, drive, and total fearlessness!  I'm working on a book, ""***Tapping Into The Goddess Inside of You.***"" I am hoping to help women and men, see that there is more to life, your existence than what you were subjected too, and that the Mind is not you. But instead, a part of you, that you need to control with your gut/intuition.  I know it's not easy, but just saying that - is an excuse. Words of Drake, ""*we are not here for a long time, just a short time,*"" is correct.

Life is indeed short; our State Of Mind is not a reflection of us, but rather a piece for a much larger beautiful self, that still needs to be discovered.

11,"I have no true goal in mind here, but I just need to get some things off my chest. I'm only 14 first of all and at the time I've had self-confidence issues for the past year. To the point where I couldn't look at myself in the mirror without wanting to blow my brains out. But I've always been told, you're so pretty though, and that I had the most beautiful body type and I should be lucky I wasn't **fat**. I always hated that one.

No. None of this is true, and truly, I don't have a beautiful body. I am skinny as hell, I have acne, I for some reason can't get my dark circles to be lighter or my teeth just a tiny shade whiter. Yeah. I look like shit. 

At this point, I've come to accept the bad things about me, cuz yeah. ""You're your worst critic."" I get it, cuz everyone wants to be perfect! Which is totally fine considering today's society. But, I always ask these questions that seem to make people uncomfortable. And I feel bad about it. 

Yes. I know my legs are long and skinny, but when I ask if I look skinny, I don't need to hear *""Ugh, you're fine.""* That... Hurts. A lot more than people realize. 

But it did make me realize myself, that it's something I say and ask too often. I've had enough of it already and even though these toxic thoughts have been a part of my life for less than a quarter of it, I'm done. I'm just done. 

I've told myself many times before now that today is the day that I finally end it and be done with it. Toss it out like a bag of garbage, which it is.

So. 

I'm done. 

From this day forward, I'm going to punch my anxiety in the balls and say hell no, and be a teenager. A teenager that'll probably smoke weed, get a fashion sense that I think is good, and eventually do some sneaking around. 

I'm gonna be me. And from now on, that horrible, starved-looking girl in the mirror isn't going to really be me.

13,"Over 10 years ago I was a passenger involved in a car into a semi accident. I had my permit at the time but afterwards I let it expire. It took me years to finally get my license. It didn't happen until after the birth of my daughter. Now I love driving. I especially love driving in my new state where takes me 20 minutes at 55 mph to get to work. I tend to have a lead foot. But as soon as that road turns from a 2 lane to a four lane and I start creeping up on that semi in the right lane my heart starts to race. I can feel my nerves twitching. I either find myself choosing to back up off the gas and go slow enough that the semi stays slightly ahead of me or stepping on the gas enough that I can pull out ahead. But I can never drive right beside one of them.

---
The first time I saw her it was like love at first sight. We didn't have sex, we held each other and the love vibrated off of each other. When I awoke I somehow knew i'd see her again but only in my dreams.
---
Lately I was dreaming and there's a knock at my back door in a house I lived in during my teens, it's the blonde woman as a police officer. She's asking me if it's okay if she comes in to have a look around, i'm outraged and paranoid, I say no, no you cannot come in. I do not need to give you a reason. As she leaves i'm in a panic to rush upstairs to my room and stash any weed I have. 
---
The other night i'm walking up the street with a handgun, it's heavy and realistic. There's three guys i'm approaching and I hear a couple bullets fly past my head; so I immediatly raise my gun and fire back, I don't think I hit any of them but they scatter and so do I. I rush back to my flats and end up at a party. It's as if there's a party going on in every room of the flats, the police storm and they're looking for anything, but mainly the guy who had the gun. They know it was a guy wearing a blue hoodie and that was me. I change clothes, i've got weed in all of my pockets and I rush back to my flat to stash some and then into a random bathroom in the flats where I see a home bargains work jacket and I put some in the right handside pocket and leave the toilets. It's all a panic and police are still everywhere, looking, questioning, but for some reason not searching people. Eventually they leave and the anxiety drops; I try to find my weed but every door I open is a different bathroom. I know when I entered the bathroom I stashed it in a coathanger I saw on my right hand side and that was where the jacket was. Each bathroom I enter, there's no coathanger on the right. The dream is getting fuzzier and fuzzier like i'm running out of time and I end up in my flat where there's also weed stashed in all kinds of small places. The blonde woman turns up again and I wake up.
---
Last night i'm in a garden; the blonde woman approaches me. She's not wearing a uniform just a cute outfit and i'm kind of shocked she's approaching me, she doesn't say anything as if i'm supposed to make the first word. I stutter a little and say 'Do you wanna fool around?' &amp; she gives me a cute look and says yes. Some things happen and then we enter the house, she lives there with some other women. There's... Nobody in this house goes to work, but there's food everywhere; some drugs. It becomes apparent that this is what they do everyday, they eat, they get high, they fuck, they sleep rinse and repeat and it's almost as if i'm welcome to join and stay. 
---
When I wake up from dreams like this I always notice one thing. I feel either what it's like to be normal, or true happiness for about 5 seconds. It's as if it takes your brain 5 seconds of waking up to adjust and realize who you are and what your life is actually like. Those 5 seconds after waking up are the best 5 seconds of my life and I treasure them deeply. I like going to sleep now, it gives me a whole dream and 5 seconds of real life where I feel something.
---
I'm not really religious or superstitious but I swear she is some kind of angel. If angels exist. It's not that I want to meet this person and marry her, not at all like that, but it feels as if i'm being watched over.

Maybe that's just 11 years of smoking weed. It would make sense. 

Recently I decided to just stop smoking, even if I rationalize how it's okay I made a decision that 11 years of trying to quit and failing is a big slap to the face. In those 11 years i'd very rarely dream, you don't dream if you smoke weed. It just doesn't happen. 
---
I know i'll dream tonight, I know there will be weed, I know there will be guns. I know there will be police. It's so exciting and real. When I wake up there's that 5 seconds of... Euphoria. 

Then it's back to groundhog day.

If anyones wondering, the turning point for me with weed was my diet. I haven't ate properly in at least a year, usually I have a bowl of rice and gravy with 2 sausages a day because whenever I get paid I just blow it all. I've noticed i'm getting cramp sometimes which is a nutrients deficiancy, my skin is developing dryness and eczma which I simply have never had. My ears became infected and I was advised to use some oil from the pharmacist to clear the blockage which costs £3 and in 6 months i've not bought it. My ears itch - all the time - I can feel them now. It's painful, not itchy.

My plan is to start spending money on food rather than weed, I weigh 9 stone / 126 pounds at the moment and i'm 26 5'11. It's far too skinny. I'll lift weights i'll cycle i'll jog i'll train my dog (whom doesn't live with me, thank god). I try and visit her most days at the moment. But my families home isn't so welcoming to me, so.  
---
It's as if this woman is checking up on me via my dreams. If I smoke I won't dream and I won't see her, if I don't she'll be there and i'll be stashing weed away somewhere she can't find it. It's strange.

I just wanted to share.",17May2019,3
24,"**Context about the class before I start:** I am a 17 year old dude and I'm finishing up my junior year of high school. I was supposed to take 2 years of a language class in my freshman and sophomore year, but I didn't and now I'm doing it in my junior year. Since I'm doing a language class really late, I'm the only junior in the class with about 20ish freshman! Yeah! The class I'm doing right now is ASL (American Sign Language) but I'm not actually. The teacher who teaches ASL had a baby and wasn't able to teach the class for both 1st &amp; 2nd semesters. We had 2 temporarily long term subs, but they ended leaving after 3 months. For this last month of school, we've been having a new sub each day. And today a sub got a lot of shit thrown on him because of his race.  


Today when I walked into class I saw that our sub. I said hello and went to my seat. Once the bell ringed a bunch of freshmen that were standing outside of the classroom all walked in being really unnecessarily loud. They all sat down and continued to be very loud. The sub got up from his chair and typically said ""Hello class! I'm Mr.\[sub name\] and I'll be your sub for today."" He said this in a very heavy accent and a couple of freshmen turned and looked at him and had a big smile as if they were trying to hold in their laughter. The class got quiet and sub said that he'll be taking roll from the seating chart and that we better be sitting in our assigned seats. He started calling names and was having trouble pronouncing names and was doing that best he can. Every time he said someone's name the freshman would giggle and just say ""here!"" as he was calling names he noticed that 2 entitled freshmen cunt girls weren't in their seats. He asked why they weren't in their seats and one of them said ""We got moved! Haha. This is our new seat."" She is full of shit. He said that she and her friend need to go to their right seats. They laugh and tell him to just do his job. In my head, I was like ""You fucking cunt. He is doing his job. He's doing what he was told to do and that they need to be seated based on the seating chart. Fucking assholes."" He surprisingly just gave up and finished taking roll.   


As I was working on assignments for another class, I overheard the two girls talking in spanish as they pulled out their phones.  


**cunt1:** Pinche chino cochino piensa él me puede decir dónde puedo sentar haha. (*Fucking nasty chinese dude thinks he can tell me where I can sit haha*)  


**cunt2:** Él necesita ir para atrás de donde se llegó haha. (*He needs to go back where he came from haha*)  


**cunt1:** Ni sabe cómo hablar en inglés! ""Herow I am you sub four to DAY"" (*Nor does he know how to speak in English*)  


**cunt1:** Al cabo de un rato él irá a tu casa y se comerá a tu perro (*After a while he's going to go to your house and eat your dog*)  


After that, they busted laughing and the sub got up and said ""Shh! And put away your phones or e-e-else I'm gonna- going to get suc- security to take it away."" Almost everyone bursts out laughing and the sub just sits back down. After that a couple of freshman around me started whispering about pretty racial shit: jap, ching chong, ask him if he can say Charlie, and a couple more. I honestly didn't know they knew some of this stuff. At some point, some kid stretched the skin near his eyes so he can look Asian. I have never wanted to beat the shit out of someone in my life. Like 95% of the class is Hispanic and they're telling some random Asian dude they never met to ""go back to his country?! Wtf is wrong with these wanna-be edgy assholes. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt that they're not racist kids, they're just trying to be funny edgy teens who think they're on top of everyone.

We had an asian sub that had a heavy accent and two girls started talking shit about him in Spanish and being racist and then the freshman class laughed at the dude for stuttering and wanted to be edgy dicks about his race.",17May2019,4
25,"i messaged my mom about this and she replied that we'll go to the doctor soon. 

a brief history of my scoliosis:

- learned i had it through an xray back in 2013 for the school's medical record. it was mild (and only 1 curve) so we didnt bother going to the doctor (#1 mistake, because we could've prevented it getting worse if i was prescribed to wear braces or something)

- 2016, i forgot what i was doing an xray for but we noticed that it was worse. 2 curves

- late 2017 we went to the doctor and he told us to get this more detailed xray for my spine. he measured the 2 curves as being 24 and 28 degrees (i forgot the exact term/s of what my scoliosis is called). i was put into physical therapy foe around 8 weeks, and was given a daily exercise/stretching to do. i do that for a couple of months then i stopped because i got busy and lazy. 2018 was basically a year i did nothing for my spine

- here i am in 2019, and im only noticing that my back hurts, especially in the lower half where the greater degree curve exists. i try to feel the outline of my back and i think it has gotten worse. im even having backpains in that area now, and maybe ive overmagnified the feeling because i keep focusing on it (i have health anxiety)

my fear now is that, if it gets worse, and worse than i thought, maybe ill have to undergo surgery which im really scared of. 

im also thinking that what if my exercise has been making it worse? for reference, im following emi wong's hiit no jumping 15 mins a day exercise on youtube. it involves leg, arm, and abs exercise

final thought is, im currently studying a course that involves a lot of desk work and blueprints so im sitting for long periods of time hunched over. so my posture isnt good in the first place

if you're reading up to this point... thank you, i guess. i just needed somewhere i could vent this to. im the only one among my friends with moderate scoliosis, the ones that do have scolio only have it mild and havent gone to the doctor anyway, so they cant relate.",17May2019,2

All the times I tried (and failed) she got sick of me in only a few weeks because I am too dumb, quiet, shy, stuff like that. The worst part is, I don't want to want to be in a love relationship, but that a force beyond my control

See what I am talking about:
There was a girl these times, somehow interesting to me (I hate to feel that), well any movie character or at least a reasonable male human being would go talk to her, right? I tried to do so, but spent whole months only saying ""hi"" and breathing that intoxicating yet addicting perfume of hers. I said only ""hi"" she said ""hi"" and then my mind got into a void and I couldn't say anything more, she stared at me for 1 sec with that face of ""what are you stupid or something"" then gone, imagine everyday like that, I can't even explain, it's too strange, I don't know what happens. I suppose I could have asked her name, but isn't weird or suspicious when some random person out of nowhere asks your name? Even today I still don't know her name though, I don't know anything about her, actually, and this is only one of the many awkward situations I've been through because of my personality 
(Not to mention my totally screwed look of a slender zombie that haven't slept for 1 week, asymmetrical face, and malnutrition) 

I don't understand how people do that stuff, I wish there was a way of eliminate the desire, but as I said, it's beyond control

Even my own family dislikes me for beeing that shy, this so depressing.

I pretend to not care about, but deep inside it really bothers me, and makes me hate myself",17May2019,1
29,"I feel like so far in my life that I'm mediocre at everything, even at the things I do best, even on things I love. And it isn't a case of being too hard on oneself, I'm an artist so artists tend to be self-critical a lot, but it's not the case. I had always C's in high school, and just breezed past everything, and, eventually, I got stuck with art.  


Right now All the income I get is from small commissions, even tho' I'm looking for a job, any job, I can't find it, even if I did I think I spent too much time alone, I get anxious outside, near strangers, barely can look or talk to people outside, I can't really explain it, it's not fear, it's close to being uncomfortable. Outside of my folks and siblings, I don't interact much. I'm a basement art goblin that's not even that good at art, and the only reason I get said income is that I'm willing to draw things no one else would, I'm never proud of it.  


I know part of all of this is that I don't like myself, I don't even like seeing reflections of me, or taking photos, if I disappeared today all people around me would have to prove I existed would be their memory. I went through therapy, then medicine, and back and forward to things before I gave up on it, I did it after surviving a few bad choices in bad moments.  


Most of the time I just don't feel human anymore, and I barely feel connected to the few people around me, but I'm not sad about it, it's just empty, It really feels like I'm already sorta not here, I mean, I am just a speck of nothing in an infinite universe anyways, so big surprise there, but, I think I lost something somewhere, and I'm too far away to get it back.",17May2019,1
30,"My psychiatrist described me as having Aspie traits but not fully meeting the diagnostic criteria as I only have difficulty when it comes to reading other people. Anyway, because of this, I think I am more sensitive when it comes to detecting other people who may be on the spectrum.

I think one notable example is my math professor. I major in math and we befriended each other as both of us are really obsessed about game theory. He can talk for hours and hours about game theory and other nerdy stuff he likes, but he's really awkward when it comes to small talk (like he asks questions with ""you don't say"" answers all the time during small talk). He can remember everything about math, come up with funny math jokes all the time, and everything about me and other people which has to do with math, but he forgets details unrelated to his interests all the time (and some of them are very important information related to the other person...). I always get the feeling he's not truly listening when people talk about something he doesn't like. He'll say something like ""oh, that's cool"" in a half-hearted manner and I guess some people see it as condescending as it has a ""cool story bro"" vibe to it. 

I mean I'm socially awkward and even by my standards he is awkward lol. There are all these jokes in my faculty about him being ""eccentric"". I've been suspecting I am on the spectrum even before seeing a psychiatrist and I sometimes wonder if I get along with him so well because both of us are so ""eccentric"".",17May2019,0
31,"I have high testosterone levels due to some issues with dem ovaries. But this is not why I feel so masculine, I simply learned that I had to be. At a young age I was abused and therefor sought to hone my skills in during ""playfights"" with my older brothers. Both of them could over-power me, but my brother old by 2 years seemed like a good challenge. I slowly trained overtime and kept challenging him to fight or wrestle me. One day I actually did, and out of rage he began to choke me. I would have passed out had my oldest brother not walked in and subsequently started choking him out then letting him go, feeling he had taught him a lesson.

&amp;#x200B;

I stopped play fighting my brothers after that and began boxing on the streets. I grew up in the ghetto and they often would par in the streets with actual gloves and a crowd. Imagine a bunch of gangsters ages 16 and up. They didn't bother me, I was a young girl around 15yo.

&amp;#x200B;

I would put on the gloves second someone took them off and throw punches at whoever I could, they would run. But, sometimes they fought back. 

&amp;#x200B;

This was useful in building up my pain tolerance.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually this would all end in me losing with a hit to the nose. I have an old injury there from age 7 that makes it overly sensitive.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I'm older, I try to do the opposite. I'm not in an abusive home any longer, I don't feel any immediate sense of danger... But the lessons I taught myself remain.

&amp;#x200B;

It sucks, because not many people see my strength as a good thing.

I've been accused of trying to be a badass

I've been told I'm delusional for thinking I can fight a men.

&amp;#x200B;

For the record:

I've fought 3 men and won

Avoided being jumped by a gang of cholas

Allowed my younger brother to hit me, who wanted to prove I'm not stronger than a man... I don't see that as a loss though. I saved his life once and for some reason he held against me.

&amp;#x200B;

Never fought a women, as I can usually find a way out of the situation using words.

I don't want to fight, I just had to. I hope I won't anymore in the future.",17May2019,1
32,"I’ve a very passive person, not much really gets to me and when I get angry i feel that I have to hold it in. Anger was a bit of an issue for me when I was young, and maybe that’s just due to me holding it in and when I decide to vocalize my distaste I blow things out of proportion. More recently however i don’t think I’ve “gotten angry” over something for a good 4 years. Aggravated and/or annoyed sure, but never steamed over something. So, lately with me graduating college and searching for a career, I’ve been the butt-end of jokes from my brother and cousins (of which I’m the oldest) about how I’ve been lazy and the job Id find is one that I’ll live in a cubicle for the rest of my life while they all do what they love. I’m a computer science major and they are going into things like music and film. My dream is to be a filmmaker but I decided to go where the money was and fund my dream that way, a concept they don’t seem to understand, I guess. All that butt-hurt stuff aside, my brother specifically has been extremely defensive for really no reason but to always be right and on top . For instance, we were handed a free PS2 by one of his friends before I graduated, and so I took it home with me since I was a done at semester. It came with a broken controller and no power supply, so I bought them to get it up and running along with some games. Well today a few friends were over and I mentioned the PS2, saying it was “mine”. Before I could finish, my brother corrected me “whoa whoa yours? No my friend gave that to me, it’s not yours”. My brother is loud so whenever I try to call him out he just overshadows me by talking louder until I eventually give it up. And maybe it’s him getting back at me for making fun of him for a good stretch of time, mostly my last year of college. I’d always poke at him, like I do with most of my friends. Mostly middle school humor like making fun of the size of someone’s dick for example. I’m not sure, but I am leaving in a week to start some training so I won’t have to deal with it at least for a while.",17May2019,1

I feel so gay typing this but it’s true. I’ve been thinking about him all day. Out of all the real kisses I’ve received in real life, the kiss in my dream was the best. It felt better than sex. I don’t think it was a dream. It was a connection to something spiritual. I don’t think I can ever date someone else from this point forth because that person will be in my head. I just can’t stop replaying how that kiss felt on my lips. The kiss was kinda rough but in a good way. It was rough to where it still felt good but you can tell he was interested in the kiss.

I never had a GF and im a people pleaser, i dont know how to talk to people,i dont know what stuff to talk about.. i aint interesting, i run out of questions to ask..  Im boring af jeezzz.. they always ignore me, why?? Why they dont ignore you guys? Why they like you but not me?

Its like i feel happy with having friends so i please people to be my friends, i dont want to be alone. i get ignored always in online mostly cause my cringe or boring openers... tbh i  feel nice too when people give me attention or girl sends a nude. Which happens once a year.

what do i need to do? Im also a r/niceguy which girls hate they most.
Im stupid and boring and uncharismatic and no being witty and never intelligent which girls dont want.

I dont know what to talk about to people..
For ex a girl online says what her hobbies are (movies, writing, photographing, singing) what i used to say was always ""cool"" now i just ask why they like the hobby, then the convo dies.. so it becomes like a fucking interview.

Or for ex i would approach a cute girl i wouldnt know what to chat about.. it would be just silent.  Like (uhmm, hmm, uhhh) she would be bored of me, and her pussy would get dry. I fucking hate this about my self. Or i talk to girls about depression or boring stuff like how was their day what did they do this weekend :( i feel pity for my self.. or ask about how they broke up with their BF... its like im their girlfriend.. 

I compare my self to other alot about how they have a cooler/better personality, nd how you guys get girls chasing you and getting nudes.

39,"I just learned about the bombings in Sri Lanka when I noticed the fine folks of my university setting up a ""condolence"" board in one of my campus walkways and when my friend told me he saw a note that just wrote ""oof"".

While the news is tragic and the note funny, I'm sorta apathetic towards the news of the bombing. It's just something that occurs semi-regularly. It's a horrible thing to say out loud, but I can bet some of who walk past the board have thought so. 

I'm in the library at the moment. Thinking about how useless it is to write notes about thoughts and prayers and reading up the attack on news sites. I found out that the nutjob who might have orchestrated the attack may have been incited by a radical preacher in my country. 

My country is sheltering a radical preacher who according to sources have visited Sri Lanka years prior to the attack and may have inspired the attack. It sure didn't help that the bombing article cited that the nutjob posted a video titled ""What Sri Lankan Muslims can do for &lt;asshole preacher's name&gt;"".

I'm not surprised. That asshole has been banned from entering my state due to his radicalism. It made news a couple years back.

41,"I’ve never been one for monogamy - I’ve had a couple shit relationships and watched my parents’ horrendous divorce so I just can’t see the point in it. This is my sixth poly/open relationship. This time it was a married couple - I started dating the husband and then both then the wife wanted to only date a girl she met. Fine with everyone. 

The wife’s gf broke up with her today. Suddenly the wife no longer wants to be in an open marriage. I know she’s heartbroken...she was quite in love with her girlfriend. I feel for her quite a bit - she’s always been more lesbian than bi and she had an amazing two year relationship with this woman.  

I’ve been involved with this couple for the last three years and loved both deeply...but the husband and I enjoyed a special relationship over the last two while she was focusing all of her time with her girlfriend. I fell hard for him.  Things were perfect...we’d double date...wife and I would shop together...husband and I took vacations together while she was on vacation with her gf. We all met each other’s parents. It was a dream.

I fell in love the husband. And he with me.  But without the wife none of this exists. I feel like I’ve lost my family...my best friend, my lover...all of it. We talked about all living together...we talked about having children. I gave my only son up for adoption because he was a child of rape and I was very young, and very addicted to heroin to cope. But having a child with someone I was in love with....I don’t even know if I deserve that opportunity but it just felt so sweet and wonderful.  They have two kids and the wife knew all about the possibility of me bringing another one in and she also loved the idea. She had struggles having the two she had and always wanted more. It didn’t matter - her kids were mine and mine hers.

They were there for me through rehab. Especially the husband. He came to visit me all the time. I am sick with heartache over this.  Honestly I love both of them but him....to lose him I feel like I’m losing half of myself. All because she was dumped. I hate feeling this way...I feel selfish...but we were a family and I was with my dream man. I’ve tried talking to the wife...he doesn’t want to share me anymore with her though so the three of us just won’t happen.  He won’t leave her nor do I want him to. He would like to but he never would. And I would never ask him. 

I’m heartbroken over everything..her loss..my loss...I just can’t imagine my life without them. He doesn’t want it to end but if she says so that’s it. My feelings don’t matter at all in this situation. 

Ugh I’m just angry and sad and angry and sad and repeat...I’m so in love with him. I’m so used to this life...I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to expect,  I finally found something to commit to and it’s going to disappear.",17May2019,1

When they don’t/avoid it they’re intimidated/shy. It used to be the exact opposite. I believed when they looked at me they thought I was weird and when they looked away it’s because I was gross.

43,"Okay I don’t know if this belongs here but it’s where I’m posting it because I don’t know where else it should go. 

Today I went to a liquidation sale for rugs and recliners just to mess around and have fun with my friend. I didn’t really have intentions of buying anything but pretended to look at stuff. 

A man probably 70-80s starts slowly walking up to me and my friend as we were just standing around talking. Once he gets close to us he just looks at us and gives us this weird creepy smile. In my head I think “wtf I gotta run.” Then I think “oh wait maybe he works here.” 

So I look at him and nope he doesn’t have any indicators like badges or a uniform that would imply he’s an employee. So my brain goes back into panic mode. 

Either way he insists he’s an employee and asks us what we’re doing there—and I might add really fuckin slowly—while making weird eye contact that lasted too long. I was starting to get the creeps and became really uncomfortable. And at that point I really just wanted to run away. I answer his questions but I wasn’t sure what the right fuckin way to exit that creepy encounter is!! So I’m standing there thinking about how to get away and so I just say “I think I’m going to go now” and speed the hell outta there. 

(For some context I’m a teenage girl and am super duper small and so sometimes it’s kind of scary for random men to come up and start talking so that kind of explains my paranoia.)

Anyway, my question is, how the fuck do you escape that kind of encounter? Or make it not happen at all? I’ve been told that I just “look like an approachable person,” what the fuck do I do about that? I’m kind of tired of this shit happening!! Help!",17May2019,2

I checked where its development would have been at 4 weeks (don't even think we were 4 weeks in) it was microscopic, just a few cells. Modern science has given us the ability to make those decisions and that ability shouldn't be taken away from us.",17May2019,1
62,"So I Googled my old site - which sadly isn't around anymore - and I found a bunch of ones that I made.

I think most notably was Gavin from Achievement Hunter in Minecraft saying ""This tree has bad news written all over it.""

The other one is Ollie from Family Guy saying ""It's raining sideways.""

But when I Googled my old name, not only did I find a bunch of old gifs I made, but people said I made some pretty good ones. That's honestly probably the best thing I've heard in a while.",17May2019,4
63,"  

Someone please tell me whats wrong with me. What should I do to better myself. 

RANT: I don’t have anyone except my husband. Even then, I sometimes think im too much for him. I have no friends at work. I did have a ‘closer’ friend at work. 

The lunch breaks are determined by management, which was how I was ‘close’ to her, A. Then B joined the company and had the same timing as us. So I had lunch with A and B but me and A were not close anymore, not that we were super close in the first place. Then A quit. 

B started to avoid having lunch with me, giving excuses like she wasn’t hungry, the place was hot, etc. I ate alone most of the time. Being an introvert, I enjoyed my time alone even though I didn’t like **eating** alone. Then I started to skip lunch. 

It took about 4 months before I thought that B didn’t have lunch with me because she was actually avoiding me, not because of the excuses she said. It sort of affected me. I start to wonder why is it so hard for me to connect with people. And then realizing that people kept going out of my life and that its probably because the problem lies with me. I just don’t know what. 

Few months later, one of my colleagues started giving me weird vibes like she didn’t like me. She kind of rolled her eyes or something when I talked to her. I don’t know what I did. 

The office already had an ‘everyone is on their own’ vibe. We don’t have parties, no lunches or dinners outside of office and the likes, which I am thankful for. 

Im pretty sure something is going on in the office like they were talking behind my back about something but I don’t know what. I try to be nice and friendly. 

Theres this guy who also acts weird around me. Its like he doesn’t want to talk to me. 

When shit happens, I beat myself up over it but no one knows. So maybe they see me as this two faced bitch or something. 

For some reason, most of my family are like this. They too don’t have very close relationships with anyone. But at my age, I should be having friends like normal people right? 

I have only about 3 friends outside of work. Lets call them C, D and E. They are all the same age as me and I know them all from my secondary school. C and I were super close in secondary school but we drifted apart a little because we both had other friends. I had D. We were extremely close. 

E came into the picture probably because D feels like she needed to have more than 1 friend. After secondary school is done, we all drifted apart but then we make the effort to meet each other. 

now, D is married and is overseas, don’t know when she will be coming back, E is married with two kids. 

Before I got married few months ago, I asked C if she wanted to meet. But she had something on, to which I just said we could do it another day. Till now, she hasn’t gotten back to me when she want to meet. We meet up like once a year! Last year was about the same situation. I felt like she was hesitant to meet up with me maybe because she feels like it was time wasted just talking, catching up and not doing anything interesting, like I wasn’t interesting. 

So basically right now, I don’t have anyone except my husband and I have a feeling that it will be this way permanently. I feel like im subconsciously pushing my family away but they are harder to push away because my mum constantly annoy me. 

I don’t know whats wrong with me and how to fix it. I cant go to a therapist as I don’t have that spare cash. I have debt that im trying to settle. I self-diagnosed myself with depression and then recently thought im narcissistic. At least nailed it 3 is released today and I can laugh after work watching it.

64,"A couple of weeks ago, I had 4 hours of sleep. This was due to me being a lazy fuck and going to bed at 2 AM, followed by getting woken by my dog at 6 am and just forgetting to go back to sleep again. The entire day I felt very good. Sleepy, but somehow in a positive way and a, as weird as this sounds, nostalgic.  


Today it hit me. I was feeling nostalgic, because I was sleep deprived for the biggest part of the time I went to school.

We have been dating for 4 years long distance. I haven’t been the best person in the past few weeks due to finals stress but that is over now and I can be better. We are long distance but visit every few months. I am just so hurt and alone. There is nobody to talk to at this time of night and I just can’t sleep.

I love her, pictured my whole life with her and to hear her float the idea of breaking up is brutal beyond belief. She didn’t return my “I love you” when we ended the call. She is my best friend, I don’t know what I could do without her.

67,"My highschool sweet heart. We were friends on a sports team and got to know each other and finally I asked her out. She said yes. The next two years were weird and happy and sad and wonderful. I got to have this amazing girl in my life. Her family was great as well, I would talk her dad for hours about movies and technology and other things. Her mom just knew I cared about her. I wouldn't shy away from her sister either. We were voted class couple in my highschool. We really liked each other, most people knew.

I got this stupid ""thing"" in my head that we couldn't be together in college. That we couldn't make it work. There's the college ""experience""  I needed to go through. So I broke with her, she says it was mutual but I broke up with her. This was in September. 

I guess I had the ""experience"" but I'm not the hook type of person I think. I've always been the relationship person. Looking back it was dumb to think I was. I ruined this great 2+ year realationship over a few casual hook ups?!

Now I know ""I'm young"" or ""It's only highschool/college"" or whatever. You know that feeling of just being comfortable with someone. I broke up with her when we both away at college and It didn't set in what I did till winter break. I got to see there then but I did know what to say. I messed us up. Probably messed her up. Now being home for the summer just makes the thing whole thing suck more. I feel like I'm never going to talk to her again. I feel like I'm missing out on her life. I just want to be apart of it again.

I miss all the little things that make up being with her. Like walking up from behind her and wrapping my arms around her. Or the way she would look at me. Like REALLY look at me. See that person in her eyes looking back. I miss how much we had intimacy. I knew her and her problems and she knew me and mine. 

I feel like when i broke up with her I didn't really. Noy till now. I think I'm just grieving now. When I at school I didn't have to think about it that much. But being home. Everything thing I do reminds me of her. That happens I guess be so close for so long. 

I've tried to see if she wants to say hi or talk but I don't think if she wants to.  A mutual friend said she doesn't want to get back together, that she sorta has a new boyfriend. 

I just want to hold you and say sorry.",17May2019,5

71,"TL;DR: In high school I hated my life and was planning on committing suicide after my mom died so I just didn't try to do well and now I think I'm going to face the concicuiences.

In primary school I always did relatively well I'm school without putting in too much effort (consistently being 10-12 in grade). I finally made friends that I would be staying friends with, because my family wasn't planning on moving again. Then my dad died and I stopped expressing my emotions which is something I still struggle with today. Two years later I was done there and it was time to move on to high school and because I live in a small town in a relatively poor family (mom is an artist and dad left us with debt no-one knee about) I had to go to the local high school.

There things started going south. Turns out the type of work we got was very easy for me to do so without ever trying I was always in the top three students in terms of grades. This as well as the fact that my environment hadn't changed in years ended up making me have no motivation and I became more depressed every day. In grade 11 I decided to give weed a shot and started smoking alone almost every day. My final year started shortly after that and I just didn't care anymore so I never did homework, slept through most of my classes and didn't even own any books. I ended up passing, but obviously my grades weren't great, because I had no idea what was going in around me anymore.

I feel like my life is fucked up now that I have terrible grades and don't know what to do with my life.",17May2019,3
72,"I work at a collaborative school in the middle school program for kids with emotional behavioral issues. Most of my students have pretty messed up pasts and home lives on top of also having learning disabilities, mental illness, etc. 

A couple days ago one of the students asked our assistant principal if he (the student) could make breakfast the next day. Turns out this kid really likes to cook. The asst. principal agreed and brought in the stuff to do it. Somehow i ended up being the one supervising this situation. As you may be able to imagine things get out of control pretty quickly with these guys, and i had a couple of the biggest offenders with me. 

But these kids fucking killed it. 

They worked together as a team to make eggs, home fries, and toast (enough to feed probably 10 people). I was so impressed by their behavior the whole time, and their cooking abilities (the food was delicious).

75,"I’m so sick and tired of having anxiety over the stupidest things. I’ve been through some shit in my life and over time my anxiety seems to only get worse. My bf and I have a very great, healthy relationship. And for some reason, I get so nervous and uptight about things like if he’s having a bad day, I caused it. If he wants to take a day off, it’s to be alone and doesn’t want to spend time with me. Like. I know in my heart that this is all foolish. Truly. I completely can grasp the fact that he’s not mad at me and that I haven’t done anything to upset him and I think that is what makes me so angry with myself. But FUCK! This is so frustrating. I recently started going back to therapy and trying to work through my shit and I think it’s been going well. But even then, I’ll be there and I’ll be talking about my shit and my emotions and I’ll be like “I know this is dumb. I recognize that there is no reasonable excuse for me to be nervous and upset about this. But here we are!” And even then! I sit there thinking that my therapist is judging me. I actually really like her, we clicked well.  So why do I feel like this? Shit. I know I’m a people pleaser. For example. My bf and I just had the conversation about whether or not we wanted kids. And I had been going back and forth for years. And you know what I found out??? I only wanted kids because EVERYONE AROUND ME wanted me to have kids! I don’t want them for myself! How messed up is that? I was PISSED when I realized that. I’ve started to try journaling when I get really stressed and that seems to be helping quite a bit.

78,"Minecraft was released as an alpha version on May 17, 2007, for PC. This was my first experience with the game. I had no clue that this game would forever shape my life. I started playing it on December 26, 2016. I always played Creative mode, so I haven't experienced Survival. My friends and I always played Minecraft together, until Fortnite came along in 2017. I accepted that I was going to be stuck with a bunch of younger people. This year, everybody started talking about Minecraft returning to its old state, but my friends still play Fortnite. I'm speechless about the history of Minecraft. Here is the end poem: 

""Does it know that we love it? That the universe is kind?
Sometimes, through the noise of its thoughts, it hears the universe, yes.
But there are times it is sad, in the long dream. It creates worlds that have no summer, and it shivers under a black sun, and it takes its sad creation for reality.
To cure it of sorrow would destroy it. The sorrow is part of its own private task. We cannot interfere.
Sometimes when they are deep in dreams, I want to tell them, they are building true worlds in reality. Sometimes I want to tell them of their importance to the universe. Sometimes, when they have not made a true connection in a while, I want to help them to speak the word they fear.
It reads our thoughts.
Sometimes I do not care. Sometimes I wish to tell them, this world you take for truth is merely [scrambled] and [scrambled], I wish to tell them that they are [scrambled] in the [scrambled]. They see so little of reality, in their long dream.
And yet they play the game.
But it would be so easy to tell them...
Too strong for this dream. To tell them how to live is to prevent them living.
I will not tell the player how to live.
The player is growing restless.
I will tell the player a story.
But not the truth.
No. A story that contains the truth safely, in a cage of words. Not the naked truth that can burn over any distance.
Give it a body, again.
Yes. Player...
Use its name.
Postman. Player of games.
Good.
Take a breath, now. Take another. Feel air in your lungs. Let your limbs return. Yes, move your fingers. Have a body again, under gravity, in air. Respawn in the long dream. There you are. Your body touching the universe again at every point, as though you were separate things. As though we were separate things.
Who are we? Once we were called the spirit of the mountain. Father sun, mother moon. Ancestral spirits, animal spirits. Jinn. Ghosts. The green man. Then gods, demons. Angels. Poltergeists. Aliens, extraterrestrials. Leptons, quarks. The words change. We do not change.
We are the universe. We are everything you think isn't you. You are looking at us now, through your skin and your eyes. And why does the universe touch your skin, and throw light on you? To see you, player. To know you. And to be known. I shall tell you a story.
Once upon a time, there was a player.
The player was you.
Sometimes it thought itself human, on the thin crust of a spinning globe of molten rock. The ball of molten rock circled a ball of blazing gas that was three hundred and thirty thousand times more massive than it. They were so far apart that light took eight minutes to cross the gap. The light was information from a star, and it could burn your skin from a hundred and fifty million kilometres away.
Sometimes the player dreamed it was a miner, on the surface of a world that was flat, and infinite. The sun was a square of white. The days were short; there was much to do; and death was a temporary inconvenience.
Sometimes the player dreamed it was lost in a story.
Sometimes the player dreamed it was other things, in other places. Sometimes these dreams were disturbing. Sometimes very beautiful indeed. Sometimes the player woke from one dream into another, then woke from that into a third.
Sometimes the player dreamed it watched words on a screen.
Let's go back.
The atoms of the player were scattered in the grass, in the rivers, in the air, in the ground. A woman gathered the atoms; she drank and ate and inhaled; and the woman assembled the player, in her body.
And the player awoke, from the warm, dark world of its mother's body, into the long dream.
And the player was a new story, never told before, written in letters of DNA. And the player was a new program, never run before, generated by a sourcecode a billion years old. And the player was a new human, never alive before, made from nothing but milk and love.
You are the player. The story. The program. The human. Made from nothing but milk and love.
Let's go further back.
The seven billion billion billion atoms of the player's body were created, long before this game, in the heart of a star. So the player, too, is information from a star. And the player moves through a story, which is a forest of information planted by a man called Julian, on a flat, infinite world created by a man called Markus, that exists inside a small, private world created by the player, who inhabits a universe created by...
Shush. Sometimes the player created a small, private world that was soft and warm and simple. Sometimes hard, and cold, and complicated. Sometimes it built a model of the universe in its head; flecks of energy, moving through vast empty spaces. Sometimes it called those flecks ""electrons"" and ""protons"".
Sometimes it called them ""planets"" and ""stars"".
Sometimes it believed it was in a universe that was made of energy that was made of offs and ons; zeros and ones; lines of code. Sometimes it believed it was playing a game. Sometimes it believed it was reading words on a screen.
You are the player, reading words...
Shush... Sometimes the player read lines of code on a screen. Decoded them into words; decoded words into meaning; decoded meaning into feelings, emotions, theories, ideas, and the player started to breathe faster and deeper and realised it was alive, it was alive, those thousand deaths had not been real, the player was alive
You. You. You are alive""

79,"This is literally my favourite childhood story and I felt like making some people laugh. 

A bit of background, my family lives in South Africa close to the back so ever since I was small and we visited, we'd walk on the piers of the beach where people are fishing. 

On this day, I was 6 years old and my dad, brother and I decided to take a walk on the pier. I couldnt find my shoes so my aunt lent me a pair of her old sandals which were massive on me. 

We're walking along and we get to the end of the pier where everyone's fishing off the end. It's super peaceful, just fishermen, the sound of the waves, and my family, awesome. Then one of the fishermen reels something in. 

He keeps reeling until a freaking poisonous puffer fish flops onto the pier in front of us and starts blowing up. One of the men places his foot on the fish so that it wouldnt jump and accidentally sting someone. The fish, still puffed, has now stopped flailing about so the man takes his boot off of it. This all happened very quickly and 6 year old me was shocked and afraid of being poisoned. So with the little socket skills I had and oversized sandals that basically hid my toes, i booted that fish straight off the pier with my aunt's sandal soaring after it into the deep sea. Every. Single. Person. Started laughing at the pure stupid courage only a child could have while I internally panicked, not because I could have been poisoned, but because I had lost someone else's damn shoe in the process. 

I was not in trouble for losing the shoe or almost poisoning myself, but this story is still told at almost every family gathering. The little girl whose fight or flight instincts were hardcore",17May2019,22
80,"WARNING:  long of text. This story may trigger. 





My story happened 2 years ago and finally, now I can write it down and share to everyone via this sub. This can be too tough with some one but, yes, it completely true and happening to me.
It started when I 16 years old, got into the first year of my high school. Long story short, I met a guy, just call him J, at my extra English class and eventually, got into him. It was like we both born to be together, we matched at almost everything, hobbies, family issues and even the way we think about life. I was so fall in love with that boy. At that time, because I was not a best child among all my siblings, so got I into a lot of trouble with my parents. I chose not to believe them I stopped sharing my thoughts and difficulties to my mom, who I trusted the most before. So... It's obvious, there are no one, except J that I trusted the most. I totally believed in all advices he gave, truly trusted everything he said. And that was a moment turn my life into a completely different way.
I was... raped, at the age of 16, by my recent boyfriend, in his house, on his bed. That day, I hung out with him as usual, but eventually, was being tired and had headache. My family had a small party in that day, so I lied to them that I had an extra class at school. It led me to the situation that I can not go home for rest, then J advised me to rest at his house. I thought it'd be fine if I could take a peaceful nap so I agree with him.
When we went inside his house, I noticed that there is no one except us, the house is quite and seems to be a good place to sleep. So, I laid on his bed, closed my eyes.
It began when he tried to kiss me when I felt asleep, I thought that was a kiss for waking me up but I still tired so I kept sleeping. But... There was something, something made me felt uncomfortable.... While I was sleeping, he put all my clothes out, then.... It happened.
After that day, J convinced me that I need to remain doing that thing to show the love of my. Now, it seems ridiculous..... But.... I was 16, he was everything to me. So... J kept abused me, forced me do it almost every day, without protection (because he wanted his true feelings and ""have my own ways to keep it save"" - he said). It was like in hell, but cannot escape, he warned me that if I refused, the fact that I'm not a virgin.... Boom.... Everyone will know. 
I was too scared and... Yes... Still being a silly girl, trusted him.  Although I had learned about protection, pregnancy at school, but I.... being blinded and let him do it many times... No protection. 
Did I mention that J was 18 at that time? Yes, he was going to graduate. chose to study abroad and joining in a college in a far far country (*whispering* a developed one :)). Long story short, one day, I had MORNING SICKNESS. But.... Still... I thought it'd be some symptoms of a disease . The morning sickness is not as bad as the real one which happened to my mom. Otherwise, because I sometimes skip my meals, so it normal to have Stomachache (whose symptom is to feel nausea). No sooner that he got used to live in another country than I realized that I pregnant. 
I found out I had been pregnant for 5 months. I was really scared, afraid and going through pain that lasted even after everything has passed. Things that I used to know and believe in is now gone. At first, he was supportive by seeding back money for me to do it by myself but it did not work out, then I told my mom - the only right thing to do at that moment. Like every mom would do, she was furious but protective and decided that we should immediately have an abortion. She was mad at me for not listen to her words, at him for doing this to me and was at a point of gathering information for a lawsuit against him but she give up half way because she think that he wasn't worth her time anyway. It's easy to understand because the law for that kind of criminal isn't strong and strict enough and... He isn't here, isn't in this country..... 
At that time, I met a friend, he helped me with everything, treat nice to me, try his best to comfort me., etc. And... You know what, that led to the fact that J posted a status told that I cheated, things that blame me.... And... That was enough for me.
After being discharged from the hospital, I made the decision to break up him because of everything that he ever did to me - more on that in another time. He didn't agreed and kept being persuasive on how much he love me and he wouldn't do it again and we would live happily together when he took me to Italy , etc. I ignored it and kept my head straight, thing when for a dark turn when he start posting statuses on SNS about how he see me as just a trash, a toy of his and no one else would ever love me for what happened. He was enraged by the fact that I left him when he was doing ""so much"" for me, he didn't even consider that his actions was the cause of our break up. He think that he was right, he think that I was nothing but his mistake. I didn't have a choice when I was with him, it fell like i'm a prisoner and he was a warden not girlfriend or boyfriend.

Not long from that day, J had new girlfriend. He told her that it was all my fault for breaking up, cheating on him. He hides the fact that he was a rapist and... Ye... What I had to get through. His new girlfriend texted me once, said bad things to me, and tried to convince that it's just me, who make his life worse, and how inappropriate am I. I don't know why but she tends to think that I was not be thankful for all good things that he had done for me. OKAY... BE GRATEFUL.....  After all this..... 

That's all I want to share, I have kept it too long.... Not knowing how and where to share this story. It's been 2 years but what happens still in my mind, followings my dream, turn it into a nightmare. I have my new lover right now, that guy who with me, the kind guy always cheers me up :). I'm.... At least.... Trying to live, study and prepare for graduate. YAY! I hope no one will ever be in my situation. If you have a feeling, even just a small one that you are in the same case... Please... Seek for help, go and find your best friend, your parents, whoever you believe (but not your boyfriend)...... And try to escape from that abusive relationship.

82,"I’m in my last year of high school right now, and I’m afraid of what comes next. As my friends and I go off to college, we’re all going to have to become more focused on developing ourselves and pursuing our own paths and we’ll have less time to spend with each other. Of course that’s normal, but I just can’t look forward to a life where people grow increasingly distant and it becomes more and more difficult to build meaningful connections.

My worst vision of the future is one where all of my conversations are empty “catching up with each other” small talk about people’s kids and careers. I really love my friends right now and the conversations we have, but I feel like I’ll never be able to have these kinds of comfortable, close relationships where nothing is off limits ever again after I graduate.

Do people usually still have really close friends after 30? Are adults supposed to retreat behind walls and focus only on themselves/their career? Or do they just find an S/O and only confide in them forever? I’m scared of finding out.",17May2019,2
84,"Hello everyone! First time posting here.

I'm a 20 year old student, studying Mechanical Forces Engineering, although when I say studying I mean I'm just a student, because I am absolutely not studying at all!

A little bit of background, I graduated from a baccalaureate exam with a 89.2% score, I personally aimed to enroll into architecture, which for my luck, in the all years there ever was a BAC exam here, mine was the one with the most abnormally high scores, usually with a 89% score, I'd be able to enroll into almost all engineering faculties in University, but with my year, I didn't get any faculty at all, so I couldn't study at University for free because of that, so next thing is paid tuition, which is something I wanted to avoid cause it's very expensive, but overall I decided on it, but even then, when the defining scores for paid tuition were released, architecture required 89.5%, I missed that by literally 0.3% only. Which was a huge blow.

Overall, I decided if it's not architecture, I won't pay, because I just know I can't study the only available option, Mechanical Forces Engineering, but after lots of arguments with my parents and fights, they ended up forcing me to it.

Overtime I accepted my reality and well, enrolled into the uni just one week before the mid term exams, I couldn't study at all, and failed 4 out of 6 subjects.

Some months later, here I am, I'm supposed to be able to study now, but I just can't, I'm extremely procrastinating, more so than ever! Tomorrow I have a practical Maths II exam, and it's been 6+ hours today where I'm sitting on the table just trying to study, but always getting distracted, getting lazy, sleepy, or want to do other stuff.

It's not only this day, I've been trying to actually study for more than 2 months now, but no luck, I just can't, or, I won't.
I am sure that I can study it and be successful, the subject materials are about the same as the BAC exam, just a tad bit harder, but I won't, I'm convincing myself that I can't when I deeply know I just don't like it, I hate this faculty with all my being, I considered it to be a nightmare and that there's no way in hell I'd study this, but here I am, with a faculty that is REALLY GOOD objectively, but absolutely not; subjectively.


Worst of all is the guilt trip I'm on, sure, my parents did force me into this, but I can't tell them if I failed it's your fault, I'd feel u gratefully considering they helped me tons and tried to make sure I get it easy after I enrolled. If I didn't study, I'd feel guilty because they have so much hope for me, and that I'll be a disappointment to them, my mother especially daily keeps telling me to NOT fail, that studying is all I have.
I'm also feeling guilty for my girlfriend, which she also wants me to succeed as much as possible and likes to be proud of me, failing means I also am a disappointment to her..

Overall, right now, it's been 6 hours and 40 minutes at my desk, trying to study, but failing, getting distracted, and just feeling weak physically and mentally. I've tried all methods of studying, studying for an hour then taking a 15 minute break, or a 30 one. Or studying in chunks and all that. 
It just doesn't work, I am procrastinating like there's no tomorrow, wasting my time instead..


I don't know what to do, Reddit, what do you advice me to do? I really don't want to fail but it seems inevitable at my current rate, I'm ashamed and guilty for this, and its seriously affecting my life that I can't enjoy anything else. (Everything aside from my studying is going really well, like, really really well! But the moment I remember studying I can't enjoy the good part of my life..)


Thank you.",17May2019,1
85,"There’s something that tethers her to fall in line- be just like the others- and only be unlike them only with a specific few. 

It feels nonsensical but it’s what makes her feel safe. 

Somehow protected, like she’s sheltering herself. She acts proper in front of those she doesn’t know and improper and free and her with those she knows, trusts, would gladly do anything- perhaps not death- but she would risk almost anything for them. 

Today, she’s with someone she has to be proper with. A shame, but needed. So she nods her head and smiles prettily although all she feels is rancid anger reigned in by her want to keep things diplomatic. 

Peaceful - she wants it in her waking world but when she dreams, she wrecks havoc, strangles sods, and most of all- she reigns all powerful.

Unfortunately, she knows all too well she is weak in reality, so painfully weak. 

She doesn’t have the means to train without getting noticed. Does not want to train getting noticed and causing a scene. She likes subterfuge although her entire family does not. 

Except her mother, but where is she now but dead and cremated. 

She has never felt so utterly alone. She fears the insanity growing as the empty feeling in her heart emphasizes every aching phantom wound for she knows for a fact she has never been fatally injured her entire life.

She made sure of it by sheltering herself but she forgets she cannot shelter others, especially not her elders. Though she tried her best- she begged- got on her knees, and says anything. She’d do anything. 

Her liver, her kidney, her heart- take it all, just don’t- don’t lie down and never rise again. Take it, take the risk to live. Live. Live. Live.

She stares dully at the bottle of empty beer in her hand and chucks it in the recycling bin. 

It’s a hard lesson to take- especially when it came from her mother who seemed so fierce and virile- even she cannot run from disease and it makes her heart ache like perhaps she could have done something, said things in the right order of words, made the correct actions and she could change, change, change everything.

But there’s no worth in thinking over something that cannot change anymore. 

It would be a shame to live and be nothing useful, so she pours herself to trying to make something of herself when all she can feel is this ache in her that hurts and constricts and makes breathing difficult but she must remain calm, she must remain put together, she cannot look weak. 

Cannot. Cannot. Cannot. 

She throws herself back to her sheets and buries herself with blankets, curling up and holding the light under her bed as she begins to write. 

She writes of a faulty robot who does not fulfills the wishes of its creators. She writes of the feelings the robot was programmed to have but there must have been an error in it somewhere, because it’s not working as the other robots are and it makes its creator frustrated and devastated. 

She tries not to think of how it sounds like her and instead flushes it down the drain after having cut it into little pieces. 

She sleeps and dreams. Sometimes, her dreams are of her mother, peaceful and placating. Sometimes her mother instills fear into her. Sometimes, she dreams of her past, of innocent times with her playmates and has fun. 

Those are the best dreams as she always feels refreshed the next day. 

Sometimes though, she wonders if her dreams are omens of fortune or misfortune. 

She dreams of lightning and execution, of mistaken identities and a fire. 

She wakes up out of breath, shivering, and most of all- afraid. She wishes she could summon her friends from her dreams and for some reason- a thought pops up. Of course she can, they are in her mind. Her dreams are from her subconscious and her consciousness could play with them. Pretend to have a conversation and so she does, and it goes like this:

“What do you think I should do?” She asks her oldest friend of all who she has never seen since she had turned fifteen. “Do you think I should lie?”

“I can’t make this decision for you.” He tells her bluntly. “Why should you lie? That is a question which you must consider answering first before asking my opinion.” 

Her imagined friend’s answer confuses her which confuses her even more since he is from her mind, shouldn’t she understand herself? But she does not. Does not and wishes she does, wishes she was like all those other children, wishes she could have been the daughter her mother wanted, her father wanted, the sister her brothers wanted but she was not. 

She was not.",17May2019,1

90,"So I've kept a journal for 4 years (Transitioned two years ago to an online document so I won't lose my thoughts when I'd like to read them), I only type stuff up when I feel as if I can't handle things in my head anymore either in stressful or emotional times. For some reason, I feel like I should share a smidgen of it and take advantage of the internet's perceived privacy (its not that private but I'd like to believe so despite being an IT student) to relieve some of the thoughts I have been having today. Of course, for dramatic purposes I include a title (I just like to have a topic or idea I am feeling at the time to understand my emotions at the time (I have a trash memory (An increasing usage of brackets is to ensure the intentions of my words are not for defending my actions or words but because I don't like being misrepresented and because I am extremely nervous))). For a bit of background, I've been a very self-conscious person growing up and I've dealt with some kind of anxiety that makes me choke and break down in tears for not being able to speak to a crowd of 10+ people (creating a vicious cycle) when I was in school although I've solved this with an extremely kind and amazing teacher that I appreciate and owe so much to as I had been carrying this problem for a while without getting any other kind of support (I sort of feel like that the problem originates from my need to express clearly and most importantly accurately). Anyways maybe this might be interesting to see what people think of my rambling although I am indeed scared somewhat of responses (I'm a bit strange so its also somewhat ok).

 

Alone

I am scared. I’m scared of a small amount of things. Today I am scared of trusting, for I haven’t trusted someone to this extent without them betraying me. Although I might’ve attempted to voice this, it didn’t go well. I am scared of it happening again and so I am scared of bringing it up. Since if they take it the wrong way, then I’ll fall deeper into my pit. It's not ideal to try but I’ll try to take small steps to choke out whatever I can and maybe it might be alright. However I am always scared of repeating the events, my mind pulsates in pain as I type this but I will try in ways I deem safe and secure as I cannot bear to live like this for much longer. I know it's not the worst problem that has been experienced by a person but I know constantly comparing problems is not applicable and shouldn’t stop me from doing anything to relieve my frantic thoughts. I do hope that people understand, and understand that despite that “nothing is said that has not been said before”, it shouldn’t undermine the value of my words. None of this makes sense, it shouldn’t to anyone, they’re just thoughts in my head.

93,"So yesterday I had my first interview ever and it went pretty amazing even tho i was totally nervous during it. 

The two girls who interviewed me were lovely and the conversation went through pretty fluently. I learned more about the position i would be taking and the tasks i should cover and it honestly sounded so much better than i expected that i left the interview with a feeling of happiness.

They told me they would give me an answer in two weeks or earlier. 

Today i get a call from them and its one of the girls, she told me they were very happy with me and that they would really love to have me on their team.

I was super exited about the news and i quickly said yes and she went on informing me about the starting date, the salary and all the benefits that the company would provide me.  She also said that she was going to send an email with all this info and more.

So after the call i get the email, and the thing that caught my attention was that i should work there for a minimum of six months, which i know its not a lot, but I will start university in four months. i cant work and go to classes because both the classes and the job would be in the morning and early afternoon.

What i need help decide is if i should accept the job even if know i would leave it after four months.

The company is huge and international so it wouldn’t really affect them but I still feel like i would be doing something completely wrong.

Sometimes when I am down any Iron Man movies would do the trick and cheer me up. And just looking at pictures of Grumpy Cat made me laugh. I was so happy when I got Iron Man figures or grumpy cat stuff toys for myself or when people got them for me. I literally saved hundreds of Grumpy Cat memes down to my computer.

Now he's basically living off of chemo, not getting better but not getting worse.

My siblings and cousins plan these trips together on facebook, but they don't include me in on it and it just feels super shitty.

It also feels shitty because it feels like their excluding me because my son is autistic and non-verbal but they haven't tried to connect to my son in any sort of meaningful way.

    Life has been weighing pretty hard on me the last few months and I feel I need to write my thoughts out before I let it consume me. You see I’m 28 years old and i’m No where near where I wanted to be in life. Ten years ago I graduated high school instead of going to college I decided I would stay home and help my parents deal with my moms medical problems. She was being put on home dialysis and I decided instead of making my dad miss work for 3 hours everyday. I would be the one to stay home with her. I had already been working at a local restaurant and I  could just pick up some extra hours. I told myself that when she finally got a kidney that I would then go to college. Well after 3 years of home dialysis she finally got a kidney. I had been working at the restaurant and had moved up from being a dishwasher/kitchen help to being the assistant manager. I got comfortable with how things where going in life and I just kind of brushed off college. I told myself that I was never really that good in school anyways and college just wasn’t for me. I started to lie to myself and tell myself that I was fine with how things where going in life. I started to spend money on stupid things getting credit cards and maxing them out. Before I knew it I was/am around 25k in debt. Now while the restaurant I worked at is owned by some really nice people and I really did like the job it just wasn’t paying the bills anymore. I was literally working to pay minimum payments on my credit cards. This went on for around two years. I slowly started to get more and more depressed. I started to realize that I was hating life more than I had ever before. In the last ten years I had watched all my friends move away and start new lives and family’s of their own. All while I’m was stuck living in my parents home working a dead end job. Around 4 months ago I woke up on a Friday morning and went into work like I did every Friday. I got to work and right away my boss started to rip me a new one for something that I had no control over in the first place. At the moment I lost my cool I finally snapped and quit. So here I am today I just got a job at a local factory that I absolutely hate but I need to be able to pay my bills. I’m scared that i’m going to get stuck in another rut. I feel like life is passing me by and there’s nothing I can do to change it. I’ve never been in a relationship. I’m still a virgin. I have no social life. There are so many life experiences that I have never experienced. Theres only one thing that I really have a passion for anymore and that is photography. I would love to try and figure out how to make it my livelihood but I have know ideal how to. I would love to go back to school and get a degree or learn a trade but I don’t know how to with all the debt and bills I have. I truly am stuck in life right now and I don’t know how to get unstuck. I feel like something has to change or I,m Just going to get more and more depressed. I ‘m sorry for the wall of text but I just needed to get this all of my chest.

Right now all he’s talking about is himself, asking me questions, I answer letting him know that I’m really not okay, and all he does is respond with a big paragraph about himself. 

How does he expect me to believe that he loves me? He doesn’t say it to me, he hasn’t been saying goodnight to me either, yet he gets confused when I feel insecure and feel like he may not feel that way about me anymore. 

You’re messing with my feelings and I don’t even know if you know it.",17May2019,3

i just wanted to check back in. its midnight on a thursday right now. thunderstorm outside. insomnia from concussion (lacrosse); cant sleep. girlfriend and i hit 10 months tomorrow, money is still tight but i think im coping efficiently. now my main goal is to support my girlfriend, shes been getting very deppressed lately as a side effect of medicine for her newly diagnosed crohns disease (she was in hospital for like 2 weeks and almost died when an intestinal cist burst) ive been helping her find coping skills and teaching her the stuff i learned freshman year when i was in the hospital after my suicide attempt. as of right now i am recovering from a concussion but im feeling great. today was such a great day and from now on every day will be great. i havent cut since, though ive been close. and to whoever gave me the gold, thank you. so much. my phone broke, (my new from box s6 bricked itself after about a year.) and i havent been able to get a new one for monatary reasons. so i havent been on reddit in over a month. i lied, it was almost midnight, now its officially midnight. im kind of overwhelmed lately, i completed my eagle project for boy scouts, which was stressing me out, now just all the paperwork, which isnt hard i just have trouble with it. and then june 9 i go back to work at scout camp all summer, away from my family, in peace. i have my prom saturday, which im excited for, i went to my girlfriends (different schools) last saturday in the heart of my concussed state and danced and had fun through the pain and dizziness, the earplugs helped a lot. im rambling, just kinda pouring out everything because even if nobody reads this, it helps me. i havent been taking my adhd meds lately because i havent had them, and ive alwasy wanted off of them but assumed it impossible, but since ive been off them, ive started to twitch less (side effect) i feel happier, so much happier. and i feel i focus just as well and that im more sociable. i talked for like an hour with a group of popular kids today and i fit in, they liked me. all i had to do was talk, and not be scared and just be who i am. its crazy how not being able to really afford meds has come through and done all this for me. everything happens for a reason. oh what else, oh, i turn 18 soon and i think im going to driv6 hours out to iowa to buy my dream car, a cj7 jeep, and drive it home. i have enough money in my savings that id like to use for it, as it would be so much more fuel efficient and smaller and just more ""me"" than my current truck. i know with money being tight it sounds dumb but, itll have cheaper insurance, and gas, and it will be mine, and even if it isnt practical its mine, its something i have control over. 12:10, i have to wake up at 6:30. i think im gonna go lie down, if even just to rest my eyes from looking at a screen. i hope that you all get notified of this, i cant remember anything right now, i forgot the name for a banana yesterday, but i think reddit tells you all if i comment. i dont know. hopefully. 12:13. i love you all, thank you for making me feel like i belong. and supporting me. and thank you for the gold. i dont think i really deserved it but you did. i just wish you werent anonymous and that i could thank you directly. 12:15, goodnight. see you in the morning

edit, 12:39. exhauated but cant sleep. i hear a train outside , i love to lislten to them, i like trains. 12:40. the dog sighed, shes supposed to be in her crate but she got out because she was scared of the storm, storms over now but she gets to sleep in my room. 12:41. sitting here wanting to say more but im empty, out of emotions to spill. 12:42, train horn, another one and another and another and anotherm hes leaving the train yard, probably heading to the east coast. 12:43, maybe i should write a blog, i had one and never used it. would anyone even read it? maybe this comment should be a post all its own. another train horn, another. and more and more. i dont know what they mean anymore, not at 12:44. 12:45. you can tell i live in the midwest, because i say goodbye or goodnight 6 times before i actually go or sleep. 12:46. writing everything i think is like sleeping. but sleeping is more like sleeping. closing the laptop now. train horn. its far away now, hardly within earshot. 12:47. like the train horn i drift off. goodnight.

&amp;#x200B;

i ended up getting 2 hours of sleep last night. i just sat and listened to the trains. and eventually forced myself to sleep",17May2019,1

130,"9 months ago I had weight loss surgery and lost over 120 lbs. My anxiety has kept me from so much all my life. I have PTSD from childhood traumas. So I just realized just how ridiculously out of shape I am. I’m also pretty sure I’m going to kill myself someday. I thought losing weight would help my depression. I thought medication would help my depression. I wonder if suicide can run in families? My dad killed himself 3 years ago and his father killed himself as well. I’m not sure about my great grandfather. I also wonder if my mom also killed her self but that was “undetermined”. Sorry I’m just really sad at the moment. I’m 37, have a great wife, what looks like a decent life, but I’m so lost and hurting inside. Ok I’ll stop now.",17May2019,1
132,"I feel like I always do things to please my boyfriend and always try and find ways to see him if we haven’t arranged anything.

Night out without me? I’ll pick you up.
Want to come over for dinner? I’ve made too much.

I’m annoyed at myself because I am so independent in so many aspects of my life but I find it hard to put boundaries up with him. 

Any tips??",17May2019,5
