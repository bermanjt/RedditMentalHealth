0,"Little guy is only 3 months old and my sister was sick the last two days with something. It might not even be the flu, but she could barely breathe or get out of bed, so she handed him over to our mom to take with us to my aunt's house because our cousins were in town and they hadn't seen the baby yet. 

My sister slept the whole time we were out and was still sleeping/tired when we got home but my mom gave her back the baby anyway. Now the poor bug has a light fever and has been cranky and irritable all day, which really isn't like him. He's typically a very sweet little boy, who likes to smile and giggle and can already hold his head up pretty well. I hate seeing him so miserable and my sister feels better, but she's a new mom, young, so I can see that she's also really worried about her son.

I just wish there was something I could do to help him.",29Jan2019,1
1,"I'll try to keep it concise. 

I was raised in a ghetto neighborhood. I haven't really ever experienced any of these problems back then. Guess my parents were good at preventing and sheltering me from these things. Now I work as a sales rep in a not so good area. Pay is very good. The customers that come in? Not so much. I get plenty of compliments and complaints from them but they are  personal and not related to work. 

Women will tell me I'm extremely attractive. Some try to sleep with me and some tell me I'm handsome but I'm not very nice. (Obviously not every girl that is a customer will bring up this but a lot of them do) (I don't see why it's necessary for them to come in and judge me either)
Men will almost always give me some kind of dirty look. Sometimes I feel like it's because of the attention the girls give me in front of them. Other times I'm told it's because I walk around super confident or even cocky. 

Here's the problem: my entire life I struggled with self confidence issues and anxiety. I finally feel like I'm at a place where I'm happy with myself. But apparently that gives people different vibes. If I look at them, I'm giving them a dirty look. If I laugh, it's a cocky smirk. If I'm on my phone sitting comfortably in a chair, I think I'm all that and a bag of chips. I'm just sick of it. 

Today and at least once a week, some guy tries to fight me. The guy from today was arguing with a co-worker and I didn't say a word to him. Turned to me called me a fuck boy, flicked me off, and said step outside so he could beat my ass. I've been in a few brawls but when I was much younger. I currently stand at ~ 6'1 and about 185lbs, and I frequently hit the gym. That guy was about 5'6 and like 120lbs. (My coworker is his size so it doesn't make sense to pick a fight with me) I know I could've taken him but I just don't want any trouble so I just laughed off his threats. Which he obviously didn't like. This type of stuff is bringing back my anxiety and taking shots at my ego. 

Here's my question: what can I do to stop attracting that attention? I did nothing wrong and my face is my face. Sometimes I wish I do step outside for an ego boost but what would that outcome be? I'm almost certain they're just trying to act tough and get into my head. Any advice to control anxiety in those situations? 


TL;DR: Had really bad anxiety. Overcame it and have good self-esteem. People seem to mistaken my confidence at least in ghetto areas and want to fight me. Fight or flight increases adrenaline therefore makes me anxious. Wot do",29Jan2019,1

5,"I'm 18 years old now and relatively healthy. This is the story of a health scare I had as an infant, that I fortunately don't remember, but was told about later. I've told this story in other places, too, but I wanted an excuse to talk about myself, the arrogant individual that I am. So here goes.

When I was six weeks old, my mother took me out of the house more than she probably should have. One day in late July of 2000, she'd taken me to the country club and not noticed anything wrong. It was only once she got home and started cuddling me did she think, ""Man, Lucas is so warm and cuddly"". She then realized that I was *too* warm.

She took my temperature, and the thermometer read 103. My mother instantly became very concerned, because any temperature over 100.4 in an infant under 3 months of age is considered a medical emergency. Most of the time, it's not anything too serious or life-threatening, but on occasion it can be a sign of a serious infection. Said infant will typically be given a full septic workup to make sure that there's nothing dangerous. This includes a spinal tap.

My mother took me to the doctor; by this time I was crying a lot. She hadn't been thinking much of it, since I was already a fussy baby in general. Later, it would become obvious that I was in a great deal of pain, and that's why I was crying.

My doctor took one look at me and ordered me admitted to the hospital across the street. He called ahead to make sure that they'd be ready to admit me right when I arrived, so that I wouldn't have to go through triage. If I had meningitis, which is a concern in infants with such a fever, time was of the essence.

As soon as I was admitted, I was given a spinal tap. My mother had been told that this happened to all babies who came in with a fever, but she figured it was just a very bad cold that I had. She didn't think it was anything serious like *meningitis.*

After the spinal tap, which my mother said was difficult to watch, we were both taken into a room. My mother was given a bed, and they rolled in a crib for me. During my hospitalization, however, neither of us would get very much sleep.

I was attached to a heart monitor so that they could make sure I remained stable. I was also hooked up to an IV so that I could be given infusions of antibiotics to start fighting the infection. Based on my white blood cell count, my doctor suspected that I had bacterial meningitis. That's the type that can make one go deaf, and some historians believe that that's what Helen Keller had that made her lose her hearing and vision.

It's worth noting that my Oma (grandmother) had spinal meningitis back in 1935 when she was an infant in the Netherlands. It was a very deadly illness in the days before antibiotics, and I have no idea how she survived that. Fortunately, for me, we did have antibiotics, but, since it turned out eventually that I had *viral* meningitis, the antibiotics would be discontinued after a couple of days.

It was certainly a rough couple of days for both of us. Here are a few things that happened, according to my mother, during this time:

1. The doctors coming back in to check my vital signs and take my temperature, while also making sure I didn't get dehydrated. I was being monitored very closely by a skilled team of medical professionals. I was being given fever-reducing medications, and they made bringing down my temperature a top priority.
2. Me crying a lot from the sheer amount of pain I was in, and my mother trying in vain to sing me to sleep so that I would suffer less. 
3. My mother cuddling me; she held me most of the time. She'd have to be careful, of course, since I had an IV in. 
4. My mother worrying that my crying would attract the attention of people in rooms down the hall, and that they'd think she was a bad parent for not being able to console me.

After three nights, I was released from the hospital and sent back home. By this time it was confirmed as viral meningitis, meaning that I was pretty much out of the woods. But it wasn't over yet; I'm told I had really bad headaches for weeks afterwards.

I had to have a couple of follow-up visits, so that they could make sure I was recovering well. At one of them, my mother asked the doctor why I was still so fussy. The doctor said something along the lines of, ""Imagine the worst hangover of your life, for a month"".

In terms of how much it has affected my life, autism spectrum disorder has certainly had more of an impact on the outside. However, when things get tough, I, as an atheist, don't pray. I instead think of how much my mother loves me, and how supportive she was as I lay in the hospital, conscious of nothing but pain.

**TL;DR: Got viral meningitis at six weeks old.**

I like this new environment a lot better, but I just don’t feel like I fit in with anyone at school. I had a best friend for about a year and she was my first friend here. I became more open after I met her and was able to reach out to more people. About a few months ago, we fell apart and we aren’t friends anymore, this made a huge impact on me and I cried non stop for weeks. I just felt so lost and I still do. I found a new group of friends and they’re fun to be around, but I want a best friend who I can be open with and we can be there for each other.

11,"I am a 22 year old male. Fresh out of college. Working for a pretty decent company, and actually tasked with giving a presentation for new hires to everyone I work with.

Something like 200 people. I have to wear a full suit and tie even.

I told my friend Ashley, who says I constantly annoy her as a ""know-it-all"" that I was a bit nervous about it. We always tease each other. She said ""whatever you do, don't overthink it. You wouldn't want to have that dream where you're doing the presentation NAKED! Hahaha"". I scoffed at how ridiculous that was. But I admit I did blush a bit.

The next night, I dreamed I was giving the presentation. Everyone sounded impressed. Everything I was saying was on the money. Then, when I got to my key point, I heard snickering in the crowd.

The snickering turned into slight laughter. Then that grew into loud, uproarious laughter.

I felt air conditioning on my bare butt-cheeks.

I looked down and I was naked. But even worse, not even ""naked"". I was wearing nothing but a red tie and tube socks. You know the ones? The high white socks with red white and blue rings around the top? The same type I was laughed at in the 7th grade locker room for wearing while changing.

My tie hanging over my bare, lily-white belly (not fat, but a rounded belly from snacking too much and never hitting the gym).

Everyone starts snapping cell phone pics as I desperately cover my penis and turn my plump white ""bubble butt"" towards the crowd and try to get out of the room, which is of course locked.

My boss, Ms. Silvan, gets up and says ""Next time I should hire a speaker who's dressed to impress!"" and SPANKS my naked ass as I woke up panting in cold sweats.

I know it's ridiculous, but the dream felt SO freaking real. I cringe when I think of that feeling of the air conditioning on my bare tush. I blush when I imagine looking down at my bare body. And the looks on the laughing faces of everyone in the crowd (especially Courtney in Finance ugh).

Thanks to Ashley I now have this dream every freaking night for the last 2 weeks. And it never stops feeling real!

Ashley said ""oh this is too good. I can't stop mentally stripping you down to your cute little tube socks. Sweet dreams!""

She knew what would resonate with me, and now I wake up every night in cold sweats!

14,"One of the things I do from time to time is search “never” in /r/jobs. A lot of times, a new post will pop up with someone in their late teens or twenties asking for advice on how to get a job when they have never had one. Usually, the same advice will pop up. Volunteer. Fake a reason for the gap in work experience. Apply in person. Use your connections. All things that require some semblance of social skills. I think to myself I wish I had such confidence and self-esteem to just walk in a store and ask whoever is in charge if they’re hiring, without blushing, sweating, stuttering, or any other show of nervousness.

I’m now in my mid-twenties still living with my parents. Not a day goes by where I want to be able to walk outside without paranoia or fear. I’ve spent weeks inside my room at a time without ever walking outside it. I’ve spent entire months never stepping outside into the sun once. At times, I’m grateful that my parents haven’t kicked me out of the house. At the same time, I hate them with a passion. Sometimes, I feel shame and embarrassment for being such a disappointment, then I think of all the times they babied me and told me everything would be all right, without ever having me handle matters myself. I often ask myself “what are they thinking when they think of me?” Do they ever think of where they went wrong? Do they blame me or themselves?

Every other night, I either stay on the computer screen until I can’t stay awake anymore or I cry myself to sleep thinking about how I can’t do anything and I’m such a failure. I’m tired of living this way. I’m tired of having no future. This stagnation is never going to let up.

My nephew and niece, who are still in high school, have had no trouble finding a part-time job. In a way, they are becoming adults more quickly than I ever did, if I even am an adult. They ave no trouble talking loudly on the phone with their friends, going out every other night, and they just enjoy life normally.

On the other hand, I always felt pressure from my parents to succeed academically. Even still, I was never good at it. Maybe if I was just raised as a normal child instead of a golden child, I wouldn’t be so hard on myself all the time and I would actually love myself enough to be able to be confident in anything.

I am so regretful of the years I wasted it my life staying inside, losing my bone strength, my already frail social skills. But what could I even do if I went back? I’d likely still be the same scared person doing the same thing I did before.

16,"I was reading in one of my favorite subreddits and I read a post by a person named [u/yuki\_n\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/yuki_n_) about her brother in the hospital and her care in his life versus the nurses' tainted care in his life. It reminds me of some of my own medical traumas that happened to me over time. I will mention some that are extremely mild in comparison to others.

I was born with medical challenges physically, mentally and emotionally. Emotional stress and physical stress make it worse. Physical stress is excessive physical exertion or movement. I am very sensitive both physically and emotionally. I was not born with a whole brain. (This does not mean anything is wrong with my skull.) I have been in and out of doctor's offices and hospitals since I was a baby.

One of the times I was in the hospital because stress had made my physical disabilities worse, I was dealt with by two nurses. One was more experienced than the other. The newer nurse literally fished around in my hand with the needle, looking for a vein. I was screaming and crying. They were holding my arms down. The more experienced nurse proceeds to tell my very upset mom and me that this is the other nurse's first time injecting a needle into a patient. Not the thing to tell someone who is very much afraid of needles and gets bruised by them, even when they exit the skin and body. I know that any first timer with anything deserves chances for experience, but not a needle injection for a girl who has been afraid of needles almost her whole life. I get bruises, shingles, unconsciousness, you name it, from needles. (Doctors took care of me when I got shingles after a needle injection gave me a huge bruise.) The medical world does not like to give me IV tube injections because the pain knocks me out unconscious and they have an almost impossible time of reviving me as well as a hard time trying to find my veins; and the icing on that cake is I permanently forget every time those things happen. I have a good memory but those times make me permanently forget things that happened in that time frame. So, it is understandable why doctors don't like to put IV tubes in me after getting to know me.

This next one has a sort of iffy vibe in whether or not it's justified. You guys can see for yourselves. I was scheduled for an appointment to be put to sleep so my dentist could do dental work on me.

(I, years ago, was hooked up to a machine where people could see my heart, blood pressure, etc. stats. I had to get four wisdom teeth removed because I kept biting my tongue and my cheeks when I ate and my dentist back then thought the removal of all of my wisdom teeth would eliminate my biting myself and that removing all four at once would be better for me because of my challenges. My regular numbers were between sixty and eighty; however, the numbers skyrocketed literally to a three-digit number over two hundred, when I saw the long needle - and I didn't know the numbers could go that high anyways. My dentist decided it would be in my best interest to have me hospitalized and put to sleep for the procedure.)

Back to the present dentist story, now that the necessary backstory was given. A different dentist had me as a patient when I was in my thirties. (I am 41 now) I couldn't brush my teeth and neither could anyone else when stress paralyzed me and for a long time and not even The Mayo Clinic in Florida could help me out. He was informed, when he wanted to help me clean my teeth after I started walking and escaped the sexual horrors I had been through, that I needed to be put to sleep. I was sent to a hospital where he and others then put me to sleep and worked on my teeth. After a while, I woke up on the inside but not on the outside. I heard the nurses talking about how to wake me up. I started feeling slaps on my thighs. They got harder and more painful. I couldn't tell them to stop or scream out or say or do anything. I couldn't reach up with my arms and hands. I couldn't open my eyes. I tried with everything in me to open my eyes. No such luck. I eventually was able to open up my eyes but not keep them open. I couldn't use my arms or even twitch my fingers. I still couldn't speak, even after my eyes started to stay open. My legs were massively bruised on the inside. I couldn't move them. I couldn't walk. From the slaps. And we didn't have my wheelchair, so we had to wait for me to walk since it was a dental hospital, not a regular hospital.

My mom and dentist came and saw the nurse about to slap me again in my unconscious state. Said she stopped mid-strike when she saw them. That right there has me wondering if she was truly justified and my medical challenges made me sensitive to her ways or if she truly was assaulting me. I am known for my inner strength and have been called fragile by others. I have even been advised at concerts by venue workers to be in my wheelchair to keep me safe. But if she truly felt justified in slapping me to a conscious state repeatedly, then why did she stop when she saw my mom and my dentist?

Another time, a doctor tried to give me laughing gas. I burst out giggling right away and my doctor stopped the laughing gas. He said it worked right away on me because I'm naturally happy and that it doesn't work right away on others.

Another time I had IV tubal injection, I was given valium by my doctor in the IV. I have no memories of that time. My brother told me he could hear me talking when he came to visit me, as soon as the elevator opened up. lol

Another time IV injection made me go unconscious but I have no memories of it is when my mom and stepdad visited me at different times. My mom said my stepdad playfully wiggled my foot. She said that I chatted on the phone with my sister, gramma and aunty.

A lot of people talk stink about the medical world. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Shriner's Hospital and other doctors, nurses lab technicians and paramedics in the medical world. I am grateful to God for bringing them into my life and for their mental and physical skills and achievements. I have been helped with mundane things like just advice for if someone bullies me online or offline since my brain doesn't know how to deal with it, to major things like bringing me back to life. Getting informed about Do Not Resuscitate is a very serious thing when a doctor revives me and then discusses that with me. I want to get the Mobile Life jewelry but my mom doesn't think I need it.

22,"Today I am compelled to share my experiences in school. It has been a weight on my shoulders. I have been out since 2012. Recently, a neighboring school (about 30 minutes from my old school) is being investigated for bullying. It made me reflect and remember my own experience with bullying and how it's not always children that are the bullies. In my experiences, it was mostly the teachers. Aside from students talking to me and not really including me, I was shamed for a lot. So I'm sorry if it's a waterfall of info, I'm not sure how to best format this.

Some background into me, I am Autistic. I also have ADHD, Depression, and Anxiety. I feel as though my experiences of school has created quite a bit of the depression and anxiety.

I loved school up until 4th grade, which was the approximate time when I went to this school of torture. It's a typical small school, a lot of people buddying up, and a lot of people related to each other (as in cousins). 4th grade wasn't that bad, but I severely missed my own cousins who lived a few hours away as well as my old school.

5th grade was really where it began. I still didn't know the classmates very well, as I was extremely shy. But my teacher, she left a very deep scar on me. Let me explain how.

1. I wasn't the best at homework. A combination of my ADHD and my dad being overseas did a number on my enthusiasm about school work. Because of this experience, she would yell at me (and I do mean yell) for a good solid 15-30 minutes every. single. morning of the day. And my classmates watched it all.
2. There was one time where I personally feel like she set me up and I apparantly did something (I can't remember even that day I didn't know what I did wrong). She forced me to go up on a stool (think like that cartoon dunce situation, where the school dunce sits on the stool and wheres the dunce cone in front of the whole class) and apologize for whatever it was that I did. I remember crying severely.
3. I also wasn't the most organized. I typically had a messy desk, but it wasn't really severe. It might have made it a bit difficult to find things sometimes. However, during third quarter one day, in the middle of the day, she went to my desk and berated me for having a messy desk (like she would do often). But this time, she tipped over the desk and let everything fall out. She then put it in a bin, and had me sit at the back table with my back towards the chalkboard (where I would have to rotate myself, but I couldn't rotate my chair). It made it immensely difficult for me to work. It would also hurt my neck a lot.
4. The last day of 5th grade was also horrible. She always did these awards for everybody. All of my classmates got lovely, nicely thought out awards. However, mine was petty and passive aggressive. My award was ""Messiest Desk of 2005"". That's right. An award to poke fun at my disorganization. And you know what could have prevented it? Teaching me how to properly organize, which is something that I NEVER got.

From that point on, I absolutely detested school. I never really made friends because I was so afraid to talk to others based on my past experience. It was also partially because of my Autism but that's besides the point.

In high school, the only good thing was Upward Bound. It was the only place where I made friends and really learned some skills. My school nurse was also atrocious. I was never the best at hygeine at that time, but the nurse would shame me over it. When I didn't wash my hair and it was greasy, I would be called to the nurse and the nurse would walk me to the locker room and while she hung out in the gym (which was not in the same area (as you would have to walk through a hallway past the gym to go to the locker room), I wasn't allowed to leave until my hair was washed and I dried myself off and changed. There was typically a gym class going, so there were usually students specatating me walking towards the locker room. Thinking on this now, this was discrimination and harrassment. As for my SPED teacher my junior year,  before going to my first class, I would have to stop on in and complete a checklist EVERY MORNING. What was on this checklist? It was questions like: Did you wash your hair? Did you wash your body? Did you brush your teeth? and etc. I didn't want to answer no ever because I was never alone in the SPED room, so I would lie often about some of the things because I didn't want the shame.

I cried every day of every year that I went to the school of hell. My senior year, I was lucky. My dad was accepted to a master's degree program to a different state, which meant my family would move away. I was no longer sad to go to school. I once again looked forward to school.

I still cry inside sometimes, the school of hell was horrible to me. I just hope you listened to me as I try to remove this weight a bit. It really isn't just children who bully, it can very well be adults in life bully the children. Because of my personal hell growing up, I have always tried to treat others with dignity and respect. I don't want to be that adult. If you have kids, please teach them to be fair.",29Jan2019,1
24,"The downvote system was only ever meant to be used to indicate when someone was posting off topic. For example talking about politics in r/food would be grounds for downvotes. People talking about breakups, depression, being crippled etc are not grounds for downvotes. If you’re tired of seeing someone posting about something here, just block them. If you don’t know how to do that, just click their comment in your notifications on mobile or go to their comment history, click the 3 dots, block user. That simple. Now you won’t have to see that same breakup story, that same story about sexual assault, whatever it may be.

People come here for a safe space to just talk and vent without fear of judgement. If you want to add a genuine follow up question or comment, that’s cool. But there’s zero need to be a dick “get over it” “move on” If it were that easy no one would ever have any issues in life. Your mom died? Get over it fam. Your wife left you? Get over it. Wow thanks I’m cured over night. Never would’ve tried that. Not everyone’s brain or heart works the same as you, just go about your day if you don’t like someone’s issue or rant.

28,"I’ve dated some men who, after the fact I realized could be gay. Now an inherent fear thats developed. And I dated a man I found out answered personal ads n even attempted to be a male escort. Men I thought genuinely loved me. I think I’ve developed OMJ(obsessive morbid jealousy) which sounds horrible but if you look into it really isn’t as scary as it sounds. In a nut shell- you constantly are testing partners love for you based on forms of childhood neglect n fear of trusting your partner which I’m assuming partially stemmed from the previous relationships mentioned. Anyways- today my boyfriends laptop was out, I quickly checked his email- emails he’s saved. And wham! Right there (a year and a half before we started dating) apparently he put out a Craigslist ad for a male encounters that was labeled “looking for right now”...it was all the men that responded back to him, pics, convos n all. Now we’ve had this discussion about a year ago - I caught him looking at gay porn and I felt like I was punched in the gut... I’m not perfect- I was with a female for 2 years and I’m open with him about it. It’s just he denys and told me it’s just the taboo of it. So I forgot about it. But now this. My fear is if this is something he wants 20 years down the road he might pursue it.. I’ve given an ample amount of chances for him to be honest with me about this..I set up an appointment with a counselor for a week from now so I can figure out how to approach this topic.

31,"Over the last few months I've been struggling a lot with self esteem, worth, and trying to cope with suicidal thoughts. After a long history of battling with depression, anorexia, sexual abuse and trauma, and many other things, all I could think about these days is a way out. It's hard seeing my family and my significant other and being happy around them when you know that you might not be seeing them much longer. 
Lately, my SO has been really helping me with everything I've been going through, and I can't thank god enough for him. He has helped me through so much and I strongly believe that I wouldn't be here without him. About a month or so, I started to get suicidal thoughts again,  and this time they were back with a vengeance. Several times a day I thought about killing myself, and thought of all the ways I could do so. I'm so done with feeling trapped, like life is so bad that I don't want it anymore.
Well yesterday, I was supposed to hang out with my boyfriend and our friend group,  but some plans came up and I ended up at a different event. A series of random texts and confusing phone calls lead me to believe that somehow my boyfriend was in the hospital. I was distraught,  I didn't know why he was there or how bad he was. I broke.  I couldn't imagine something bad happening to him,  he means everything to me. I would trade my entire life just for him to live another day.  I started to freak out and cry and panic, and eventually I left my event to go to the hospital.  He is currently on watch but he is okay thankfully. I can't get it off my mind,  the way it feels when you almost lose somebody and you can't do anything about it. Now, I don't think I could ever do that to somebody. I don't think I can do that to my SO, my family, my best friend. It scares me to think what would happen to them if I left.

34,"A year or two ago, my sleep schedules were absolutely fuckin jacked. One day I would wake up at 5 PM and fall asleep again at midnight, sometimes I woke up at 6 AM and fell asleep at 8 PM. This probably has something to do with it.

(alrighty, i'm shit at describing this whenever i do, so just be wary of that)

I was dreaming that I was playing a third-person round-based game where I control a tank that can be upgraded. At the end of every round of this tank game, presumably when I kill all the enemy tanks, it would fade out, then fade to a screen that shows a rotating model of my tank with the stats of the round to the right of it. Then, when I was ready to move to the next round or whatever, The stats would disappear, and the tank model would move to the middle while the round loaded and the game saved, usually only for a fraction of a second before it would fade to black and into the next round.

(note: i'm overdescribing this, but it may contribute to the feel of what happens next)

So, I finished a round, looked at the stats, and clicked to move on. The tank model moved to the middle, as usual, but then what seemed to be a game bug happened. It didn't save, the next round didn't load, my tank just stuck around in the middle.

Normally, this wouldn't be so jarring, but dreams are just weird I guess. While it could easily just be a bug, I got the feeling that something was definitely dangerously wrong, maybe even with reality itself, and that I should panic, because something fuckin *bad's* about to happen.

That's when I ""woke up"". I realized that it was a dream, and that I was in my bed, but something else was also happening. Like sleep paralysis, I couldn't move.

Have you ever gone to unplug something with wet hands? You just get a startling, completely non-painful but quite strong ""buzz""? Yeah.

For the around eight seconds I couldn't move, I was shifting through three different sensations of buzzing, each varying in frequency a tiny bit, at random intervals, accompanied by buzzing sounds. It was weird.

I slowly got back to being fully conscious, got up, saw that the sun was coming up, and walked out into the living room and continued my day.

Sorry for overexplaining, I just love ranting about myself. What makes me question whether or not this is sleep paralysis is these two things:

1. I've never heard of a jarring dream leading up to sleep paralysis.
2. I've never heard of anything resembling the buzzing.

This has happened a few more times since then, though it wasn't that spooky because I knew what was about to happen. For some reason, I can detect when it's about to happen in my dreams. Similar but not exactly similar things have happened too, and I'll elaborate on those if y'all want me to.

35,"Its my first year back home from college so I moved back in with my parents to get back on my feet from all my college expenses. I have had my small dog (family dog) -Mia for 3 years now living with my parents and I adopted an mini Aussie -Bella a year ago. This past year, the landlord’s brother started being in change of checking the meters around the property. This past summer he started complaining about my dogs being aggressive and accusing them of biting him every time he came and checked meters. My dogs are indoors at all times unless they’re out to potty which is no longer than 5 minutes when we are home. My dogs are not aggressive, they do however bark a lot when a stranger walks by the house or inside but they’ve never attacked or tried to bite anyone before. We have neighbors kids come and go, family gatherings where new people come and go all the time and no one has ever gotten bit or attacked. Today I let Mia (small dog) out to potty when I noticed the porch door was wide open so she ran out to the street. I ran after here and she made a run back to the house. When she made it back the Meter guy was standing at the front of the door blocking the way for her to get back in so she starts barking at him. He starts screaming at the top of his lungs for her to F off and stay away trying to kick her even though she’s at least 5 feet away from him. I pick her up and he threatens to call the cops on me. I didn’t say anything because I knew if I said anything that would make him angrier it’d be his word against mine. I texted the landlord telling her wha had happened and she texted me back saying I had 30 days to get rid of Bella (my big dog) because she’s aggressive and living here is making her aggressive. I explained that Bella was not the one that was involved in the incident and she then said we were only allowed to have 1 small dog living with us even though she had given the permission for 2 to live with us before I adopted Bella. I have offered to introduce both of them to her brother and any other solution I can think of for him to feel comfortable reading the meters and she has said no. I’m freaking out because i am not getting rid of one of my dogs and I currently live in a town where housing is extremely expensive talking 1,000 for a room and most places are no pets allowed. I don’t even have the money to move out right now either. I’m literally writing this with tears in my eyes I don’t know what to do. ",29Jan2019,1

Facebook arbitrarily accesses my web cam without permission?

Or was there a security vulnerability that professional hackers could access? Who is responsible for this?

Facebook case is taken advantage of as a direct hack tool, it is very difficult. I think this is 90% made by Facebook employees. First, I was logged out of facebook, on the Macbook I used to use, this was very unlikely, but it happened, when I didn't log out, log on another device, I was just using facebook. at that time.

Then one of the facebook windows, showing a red dot, and my webcam light lit. I used the Macbook, but still attacked.

The red dot appears on Facebook, meaning the webcam access is caused by facebook. My chrome browser only accepts webcam access for facebook, the only service I use for voice chat.

Now I was put under general anesthesia or light anesthesia so I would could breath on my own during the surgery and be able to leave the hospital sooner without feeling too cruddy. 

The anesthesiologist told me that when I was given the sedative I ""might"" hear voices but I most likely wouldn't remember them because he has never had anyone say they remembered anything but prepping before surgery and then all of a sudden they were heading back to their room. 

I remember everything the Drs/nurses were saying and doing, I remember one Dr/nurse saying god damn it then saying oops, then my Dr saying it's ok she can't hear you she's under right as he said that I grinned and he said well maybe she's under but I guess she can still hear us. I remember my Dr asked another Dr/nurse if I was still breathing ok on my own and he told my Dr yes she's breathing great and then my Dr said really wow. 

I did fall asleep for a minute or two (the whole surgery was only 30 minutes) then I was told they were going to take me back to my room and I got right up and they were amazed at how quickly I was responding (I have epilepsy so it just felt like I came out of a very mild seizure without the extreme migraine) the nurse asked me how I was feeling and I told her great I remember the whole thing and she looked at me and said seriously!

40,"I need to vent. If you read this and think you know me, please message me, don't comment anything. This is still a process we need to navigate. Things have been a bit rough with my husband for the past two and a half years. There's been periods of good (some of which was an act, I know now) and some periods were absolute hell and agony for all involved. My husband, well my ex husband I guess that's fucking weird to write, was diagnosed with bipolar 1 about six months ago. That diagnosis however was mainly for paperwork and not something we didn't know. He led a very hard life, troubled from the start, his mother was awful (not that any of this excuses him but it does explain things) and he carries a lot of that with him. He tried to kill himself intentionally in a vehicle accident around 18 months ago. Things have become worse since then. Our marriage had suffered greatly due to his inability to communicate. He would disappear for days. We have children.   


Lately, things got a lot worse. He was snapping at everyone. His aggression was out of control. He'd always been an angry person but was able to sort of keep a handle on it. He was so negative and so hateful of himself it was starting to be projected out. At us. His family. It's been a few months of this. I felt myself slowing becoming more and more saddened. I myself struggle with depression, and I knew that's where I was heading. Last night he accused me out of no where of favouring one child over the other and allowing a teenager to get away with murder because they dared to talk back. I took offense to this because I'm a good parent. I try really hard. And I've been doing it on my own. He spends maybe an hour a day in the house, if he's not sleeping. So today I spoke about it with him. He knew it was the wrong thing to say. He messes up what he means sometimes. But the anger and hate he feels makes him so disconnected. He said he didn't want to inflict this on them anymore. Maybe he'd get better. But maybe he won't. And we shouldn't have to wait around, walking on eggshells, while he figures it out.   


Mutually, we decided it was for the best. Because I felt like I'd been given a total different husband over the past two or so years compared to the previous thirteen. Yeah, we have been at this for almost sixteen years.   


I feel sad. I feel angry. I feel relief. And for that I feel guilt. I don't want this but I have been left no choice. To save my sanity and to save my children from exposure to what is essentially a very toxic environment we need to split. Maybe it will be better. Maybe he'll get better. But maybe he won't. Maybe we will never get back together. He wants to just do nothing, he feels nothing, he's not suicidal he says, he's just nothing. I'm not concerned he will end his life. He just wants them to be happy and he isn't even trying to make that happen, his words.

How you took advantage of a guy who genuinely cared for you, someone who by your OWN admission gave you a love you’d never had before. A love that was based on who you were not as a person not just your body. The first guy you’d been with that actually cared about genuinely spending time with you instead of just fucking.

I believed in you more than you did despite all the red flags, all the signs that you weren’t what I thought. I still believed it. Made you rich by buying all the lies you sold me.

Why? Because I was naive. Just like my therapist said. I had my first love and I was afraid of losing it. Anything was better than not having you in my life so I accepted being treated like shit, not getting the commitment, loyalty and love that I deserved in order to keep you around.

44,"About seven and a half months ago I went to get a Thai massage. 

I did my research and headed off to what I thought was a legitimate, above-board establishment (good reviews from both men and women, landline, premises on a main road etc.)

I paid for the treatment and was taken into a room.

About an hour into the 90-minute appointment the massage therapist touched my dick and balls over the towel that was covering me and began to make a hand gesture over the towel. She then took the towel off (I was completely naked) and she began to jerk me off. 

I didn’t stop her and it felt good at the time. But I never thought this would be a possibility because I hadn’t expressly gone out to get this type of ‘service’. 

I obviously ejaculated and she got some toilet paper/tissues to clean the mess. I got dressed and left. I felt disgusting on my way home. 

I posted about this a few months ago to ask for advice on how to overcome guilt, and as helpful as people were, I still feel guilt and shame. I took steps to try and figure these feelings out (saw a counsellor, threw myself into different sports etc) but I just feel really, really low and I constantly think about it and all the possibilities that could happen (parents and friends finding out etc). 

I came across this place online a few weeks later and found a site that lists what those types of places do (what I now know as ‘Happy Ending massages’) and it seems to be a common occurrence at this place (reviewers were continuing to review this place after I had been, and they are continuing to do so) so I don’t think I was the only customer to receive this service. 

I’m single, 23 and I’ve never been in a sexual relationship before, so this incident was my first encounter.  

I’m worried about how my future partner would perceive me if she knew about this incident or what my friends would think. It’s really fucking up my mind. 

I should say that (obviously this wasn’t a legitimate place) prostitution is legal where I live, though activities around it i.e. pimping or soliciting in a public place or street, are illegal.

45,"A little back story. My boyfriend is the one who taught me how to drive. He started teaching me when I was 17/18 and when we had finally gotten to winter of that year, I was dreading driving because I had never driven in snow and Michigan can (sometimes) get pretty harsh winters and our weather is always very unpredictable. Boyfriend let me use his car for a job interview that I had one day and on my drive home on the expressway, it became a white out very quickly and the snow was turning to ice the second it was hitting the ground. I ended up getting into an accident and totaling his car (boyfriend was not mad at all and handled it really well. i’m super lucky to have him). I remember the news saying there were nearly 20 accidents on the freeway during that whiteout. Ever since that day I have been absolutely terrified to drive in the snow. It got to the point where I would ask people to drive for me because my anxiety got so bad from it and if I did drive, I would be white knuckling it the entire time. Fast forward to now, 4 years later, Michigan’s winter has been pretty calm so far up until this week and I just decided that I need to try and get over this fear because I’m young and I don’t know what I expect to do for the rest of my life in terms of (not) driving in the snow. We had a pretty bad snow storm all day yesterday which is still going into this morning and I just drove in it by myself yesterday and today and did not feel anxious one BIT.

I'm avoiding the (imo) annoying other guy near me, I don't want to chat with him, I don't want to spend any longer in his house - right now it's a home office - and I don't care about the brand. And I don't really know what my dream job is right now. Just somewhere calm, I guess.",29Jan2019,1
52,"How do I do this? I suck at feelings. I am balancing mediating my grandparents (gma is wheelchair bound following several strokes a year ago and happily with her second husband she remarried 15 years ago &amp; gdad is a bachelor at 75 living in squalor alone as a near hermit). Brother #1 is falling apart and trying to keep brother #2 from drinking himself to death, brother #3 is here with me, my husband, my grandmother, and the step-gdad. For reference we are all in TX and generally distance is an issue. Money as well. But we are trying after lifetimes for once to work together. My mom was the #1 joker, and if anyone could have lifted our spirits now it would have been her. My life was already falling apart before this. I came back to my home town after... well my shit fuckt up. I only recently started talking to my mom regularly (complicated). I was not ready for this. I miss her, but I’ve had to be the strong one in this way all my life, and I gotta make sure everyone’s sleeping, eating, getting what they need. Of course I’m making an effort to see my therapist soon. I’m pagan, the family is Christian. I’m not able to grieve how I need to as a guest in a Christian home, but soon I’ll have my own space. My husband and I are taking in brother #3 (disability had him living with mom until the minute she died and now I’m keeping him safe). Is there something I can be doing more? I feel lost since I don’t connect with any of them spiritually, but I want to let them know I hope she got to Heaven, since she would have wanted that. She was no where near perfect, but she was our mom, the night one we got. Gods I just can’t get over knowing I didn’t say goodbye. I can’t bare it at this moment. But life is many moments. Just keep swimming. Mom always said “Yeah? But what’s that got to do with the price of eggs?” And she’d be laughing drunk at her own wake making jokes about her corpse. Good old mom.",29Jan2019,1

55,"I don't really want to give the wrong impression, I don't want to brag or anything.

So basically the thing is nothing 'big' I achieve gives me any amount of satisfaction nor does it lift my self esteem. Today I passed with top grades an enormous uni exam and I got back on track with uni after 6 months of lagging behind and being stressed about it. I started exercising a few months ago, last year I saved enough money to go on three different trips I had been looking forward to for some time, and lately I found the courage to come out to my best friends (nothing major but still I think it wasn't that easy).

Yet nothing gives me that 'thrill' anymore, the trips were lots of fun but that's it, academic achievements leave me unaffected and everything good that happens to me just is not enough for me to give a fuck, got a crush? Whatever, made new friends? Ok, boring.

Reading this post it really seems like I want people to know I'm having a good time, but the aim is exactly the opposite, I'm having no time at all, like I just exist.

It's funny that the only thing that makes me sincerely satisfied is obsessing over food and giving in to my eating disorder (yay for oversharing). 

What do you think about it? Does any of you live anything similar? I don't think it's depression by the way, I do have motivation to do things, I have fun and I'm an upbeat person, I'm not faking it, it's just that everything just passes without leaving a mark, I stay the same.",29Jan2019,1
56,"I'm writing today to get some insight on the situations I've had with my friend in the last while. I've felt like in the last year, when I started dating my BF who offers me amazing support, that my friend only supports me for things they agree with and I feel like I try to support them throughout whatever they do. This is going to be long so I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read/give input. 

Example 1: I quit working at a local bakery with her after 2 years because the bosses were not attending to problems that needed to be solved and the environment was becoming toxic. I left the ""hip"" (its vegan and in an area that everyone considers cool) bakery that she still worked at in the summer and worked at a grocery store. I confided in her and my other friend because I was considering going back to tim hortons because I needed to make money for school. The bakery and the grocery store only offered 25/hr weeks maximum. She was super hesitant and said it was a bad idea but to me it just seemed like she deemed it as ""embarrassing"". After a few weeks she said she supports it but both me and my other friend (that was in the chat) noticed it was weird af. I forgave her but was initially annoyed. 

Example 2: I started in a BSc this September in Psychology, but after not taking sciences for 3 years and spending 12 hours in a weekend just trying to get the intro to calculous homework figured out I decided to drop out of the BSc and into BA Psych which I was in previously. This was only a few days into the semester so it wasn't a big deal. My friend was in a BSc at the time too after not taking sciences (they are now in a diff program after that semester because realized it was not for them after one semester). Friend tried to say it was a bad idea/get all worried for me. Decided to not go to  them to talk about life decisions because they always seems to project their own insecurities and not think about me/how my life is different. A few days later she came to school and said whatever I decide she supports and I said thank you because its my life. (Again she realized but it was still initially annoying) 

Example 3: A different friend comes from out of town so we all plan a hangout. I ask in the group ""Are you guys busy tonight"" they both say no and I ask to hangout. Friend (who I discussed earlier) said ""possibly!"" (she was recovering from injury so i understood). She asks if anyone would like to go to value village/thrifting. I say I can't becuase hanging out with boyfriend for his birthday all day. She says ""then why'd you ask to hangout"" (seems passive aggressive as fuck), I say ""I meant at night"".. I legit asked if they were busy TONIGHT she said we can go at night. At this point I'm annoyed and should've been honest at first by saying I don't want to go thrifting. Anyway, my friend from out of town and her both want to go thrifting so I tell myself I'll go because of them. I didn't want to go bec I wasnt working (just in school) and had nothing I wanted to buy. Again, I could've communicated this though. So, my friend from out of town has to cancel for the night because he has an emergency. My other friend asks if I still want to hang and i say ""yes I just dont want to go to value village :("" thinking they'd understand because i thought we were honest about stuff like that and i tried to be nice about it. They say ""lmao kk im going to stay in"" and I just say ""Ok"" to let them know im like ?? and they say ""I'm recovering and dont want to spend money"". I was annoyed because if you dont want to hangout because you dont want to spend money then why do you want to go thrifting, it seems like you only want to hang because it benefits you. This frustrated me because it was like they only wanted to hangout on their conditions, also I was the one driving. Not that I care about driving but... ?? I was just trying to be honest with what I wanted and they were so passive aggressive. No apology was made and I started to feel resentful, but tried to understand and talk to them after about their recovery and injury to try and be supportive.

Example 4: As I mentioned before I thought my friend and I were open about when we didn't want to do something. They would always say ""im honest about not wanting to hangout and it doesn't make sense to hangout if your not feeling it"" and things along those lines. So we make plans on a Thurs after the semester starts. I text her that day asking if she wants to hangout still. The semester had just started and I started working a new job so I was kind of stressed out. I message her an hour after confirming and say Im really sorry but realized I have a lot of school work to do and cant hangout and Im really sorry because I hadnt seen them in awhile. I also asked if they would want to hangout sunday. They reply with no understanding just ""kk and i cant sunday ill be doing homework"". I feel bad for asking to hangout and ditching but hardly do that? They will often say they just wants to stay in and stuff but when I do it its wrong lol?

Example 5: My friend asks me and my other friend if we want to go to an event in the group 1.5/2 weeks before. We both say yes and I say I'll book it off. We never say a definite time or plan though. The week of the event my other friend says is that event this week in the group and I'm like omg i totally forgot to book it off I've just had a lot on my mind (start a new job and school.). The event runs from 7pm-3am and I finished work at 830pm so could be ready for 9pm. I offer to go at 9pm and the friend who asked us says ""thats too late"" and has no acknowledgement for me having more to worry about then an event they mentioned in passing. I end up switching the shift and everything, but im coming down with a cold. I message the group and say ""I got it switched :D!!"" and the main friend says ""are you going to ditch? im going with my bf and if you dont go ill have nobody to go with?"". I say I dont want to risk it because im sick so go without me. The other friend is also upset because they were going and offered that main friend to go with them. The main friend never apologized or anything for saying that and didn't acknowledge i went through all the effort to try and make it work. Also only wanted to hangout at 7pm when I was still available at 9pm and we never made a definite plan or time. 

Example 6: Since i've started this new shitty min wage job I have never been more uncomfortable at a job. I confide in my group chat w that main friend and other friend about wanting to quit the job after only 3 weeks (have never done that). Other friend is supportive and says if its causing me stress just quit, its legit not a big deal. Main friend says ""its good to be committed and put up with shitty things in a job"" like I dont already know that. Main friend talks about how thye has to push through hard times (ive pushed through jobs too lol and hard times).Main friend starts asking me and saying they feel like it started when i got more anxious and i say the shortest job ive worked was once for 3 months at grocery store and worked every other job for 2 years. I felt like they were saying kind of personal/not supportive things. I also said if its too much to talk about right now im sorry (so that they dont feel obligated to be there for me if they arent in the right headspace). They are prob trying to give advice but I already know that. Seems again like they are getting upset about one of my life decisions that shouldn't affect them so much.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay so, what do you guys think I should do? I feel like my friend is being a bad friend and it's pissing me off so much. I don't want to go to them for any support because they always give me their advice (and they always say they hate unsolicited advice). Also sorry for the lazy vocabulary and story telling lol i hope you can make sense of it! ",29Jan2019,1
57,"Hey friend, 
Yup. So you’re in a situation that’s ended in such a way that you don’t feel like you got proper closure. No justice was served and maybe you’re sitting here with yourself feeling all sorts of empty. For the lucky few, they got their closure and can move on but we can’t. 




That’s ok. We need to give ourselves that “go ahead” to move on. It’s tough but possible. We are actively robbing ourselves of focusing on our present and future by ruminating over the past. It’s done and we can’t go back. 
There’s no time machine we can use. Even if there were... would you really want to experience that pain all over again? 




Dear Reader, everything will be okay. When you can’t have justice, get revenge and the best kind (the only kind im suggesting) is success. Doesn’t matter the situation... be better than you were. Rise so far above that your previous hurt becomes irrelevant. 

You can do it, friend!!! Love and Light to you for the journey ahead.... ",29Jan2019,1

61,"Hello and thanks for opening my post. I imagine this isn't something a lot of people will want to talk about. It used to be very hard for me but I think after millions of times stressing about it my brain just drained itself of any emotional response.

So every few weeks or so I have this destructive urge to confess everything. I can only relate this experience to how I felt when I came out gay as a 15yo. It was terrible at first and my mom was in total denial but in the span of a few years she changed her mind completely and now she just wants me to enjoy my life. But of course she doesn't know everything about me. 

Whenever I'm down or depressed her solution is that I should go out and socialize more. She keeps telling me how handsome I am etc.

There is a barrier of connection between us that I feel like I can't cross but I want to. She is pretty much my only emotional support and I think she deserves to know. And If I kill myself soon she should have a better idea why.

68," Title pretty much sums it up, but for a little more information, I was just a jerk in high-school and college but in different ways. I'm looking for book suggestions that may help me be the best classmate/friend I can be when I start law school this fall.

In high-school I was very combative and argumentative. I was a snob and I liked to hate on things other people liked and made a lot of enemies, which I took a sick pride in. The more people that hated me, the more I looked down on them. I realize now I really really really hated myself and when you add that to the fact that school was all I have ever been good at, I see why I was that way (but I still cringe and get really sad when I think about who I was back then). I was also one of those girls who swore she ""couldn't get along with other girls"" but really I was just jealous of everyone. I somehow made a small group of friends who saw through that person and still love me today, and since then I have reconciled with some of those I alienated.

In college I tried to be a better person and I did an okay job for a few semesters, but I was a music major and the environment really brought out my ugly, competitive side. I got a little better by my very last year but in the earlier years I said some horrible things to people, both to their face and behind their back. I was a bitch, honestly. I blamed it on people being jealous that I was the best in my studio, but really I was doing the same things I did in high-school, just in a different way.

I have since taken some time off and have really been working on myself. I'm in therapy, and I know I should bring this up to her but I'm embarrassed and we have a lot of other things to work through that are weighing on me (I was groomed and sexually abused, and I really need to work through that with her, so this has taken a backseat). I'm trying to exercise and drink less alcohol, and work on my relationships with friends and family. One of the girls in high-school who I would have considered my arch enemy is now one of my BEST friends, funny enough. I am also the Maid of Honor in another friend's wedding and I'm trying to be the best damn MOH I can be. Solidifying my female friendships has been a huge priority for me, and it's been wonderful.

SO! All that being said, I am starting law school in the fall. It's a small school and it's going to be three years of seeing the same people every single day. I really really really don't want to fuck this up, especially since law school is going to be even more competitive than music school and the stakes are so much higher. I want this to be my chance to be the person I really want to be, but I need help. Any recommendations for reading material, viewing material, listening material would be amazing and I would be really really grateful.

70,"Hi everyone! So I've been living life and some things have crossed my mind about people and why they would treat others in a toxic way. It's kind of pointed me into looking at myself again.

For example, I absolutely love talking...maybe a little too much I think. I've had people literally cut me off mid sentence to shut me up. I'm trying to perk some people up at work sometimes and generally, I think I'm being a great conversationalist but oh my does it ever suck to be shut down. The words ""just stop talking"" and ""shut up already"" are not foreign to my ears and it really upsets me. Sometimes I get sad about it and think no one likes me and other times I'm so frustrated that what I was saying wasn't good enough to be talked about. So the icing on the cake being, people have gotten into their own habits of getting me to zip it and I feel so helpless against that crap! I never get my say anymore so then it's like I'm ignored and I end up dropping out of the conversation with no one asking me about what I was saying...

Another example is if I talk about achieving my goals (like I saved up a long time for a laptop and finally got it, yay!!) and all of a sudden it's the uncoolest thing in the world to people who it literally makes no difference to. Even if they initially thought that what I was trying to so was cool, it's as if they get jealous or something. I try to never exaggerate or brag about my accomplishments (with what little I've done) and I guess it makes me seem boring? Everyone brags to me about their lives and it makes me SO SO jealous that I can't seem to have that level of happiness! Like, I don't have a steady relationship going nor have I been having sex in the last year (unfortunately I blabbed about it at work...) or so but what hurts is, all the other girls talk about their fulfilling sex lives and I'm just left there in an awkward position, weirdly listening. I melt inside with frustration and jealousy sometimes and I feel like it's an attack on me as an individual. 

I genuinely think I'm a decent person! I never engage in gossip nor do I resent any one person! I'm really wondering if I am the problem and I'm just not realizing it? I know I'm annoying with my (sometimes excessive) chatter and sometimes I blab without contributing much to the conversation but not all the time! It's not fair... :( If you took the time to read this, thank you! I'm feeling just a little bit down today and felt like describing my feelings.",29Jan2019,2

74," 

I am now 19 years old and have narurally high and perfect straight hairline. Most guy of my age have a litle bit receded M-shaped hailine. It hasn't changed at any point since age 4 but as a baby I am BALD . I have thinning hair receding hairline on the top of my head. I watched a guy on youtube who says that looking at your 1 - year old photo will predict how your hair will look by age 35. I am worried that this might be true. On my baby photos the younger I am the less hair I have on the top of my head. My father is 52 year old and doesn't have any hair loss, my uncle which is not alive anymore hadn't experienced any hair loss too and kept his childish hairline till the day he died. My grandfather by the father's line who is 96 year old doesn't have any androgenic hair loss too. His hair is just thinner because of his ripe old age. In spite of this I have never seen a 96 year old man with so much hair. Most of them are either bald or have very thin hair. I checked my dad's and and uncle photos by the age of one and they both have slightly more hair than me.

My other grandfather on my mathernal side has mild balding( receded hairline and thinning around the crown) started around the age of 65 but hasn't progressed and stays the same to this day.

What I am worried about is that my great-grand father(my father's grandfather on his mathernal line) was bald and my grandmother's brother was bald too. He has perfect hairline as mine on the photos where he was young. But he started balding in his late 30's and was very bald when he was old man. Is it possible for male pattern baldness to skip generation and Can I have inherited my great-grandfather's genes and judging by my baby photos to undergo the same fate as my grandmother's brother.

TLDR:

If you are 35 years old or above look at your baby pictures and compare it to how your hair looks now.

I want't to prove that this is 100% true. This might be because Leonardo Dicapro has receding hairline on his photo when he was 1 and at age 36 his hairline receded at exactly the same rate. Paul Walker has full set of hair at age 1 and by the age of 35 did not have any hair loss too.",29Jan2019,1
75,"Last month I went on a date with a girl, and I bought her a drink at a cafe. 
At the time I thought it went really well and she was into me. I made her laugh, we had virtually the same interests (goth/punk music, mutual love of David Lynch films), and we were both comfortable. 

She had to leave after 2 hours to catch her bus, and we both said goodbye, and for some reason nerves got the better of me and I didn’t hug her or even ask if she’d like to do it again. Stupid. 

A week goes by, she’s on a school trip so I think she’s just busy which is cool, but then I find she just deletes her bumble. That wouldn’t be too bad, but she didn’t give me her number or anything, just abruptly eradicated our only way of contact. 

This threw me off, she travelled a long way to meet me, we talked for like 2 hours, I made her laugh a few times and we both had a nice conversation, so I’m convinced it’s because I didn’t make it seem like I was interested in her. She mentioned she’s a little self conscious so she probably got like that and deleted her account because she assumed I wasn’t into her, which wasn’t the case. I really liked her. She may not be many guys type because of the goth aesthetic and short hair, which many guys I know say is unattractive, but I adore it. If I had more confidence I’d dress like that everyday, you know?

Anyway, I was really into her, she seemed interested in me but I fucked up, again. I found her Facebook through her place of work which she told me about, and I messaged her a few days after asking if she’d still like to talk, but she didn’t get back to me - wether she saw the message or not I don’t know (Facebook hides messages from non-friends). She mentioned she hardly uses it so I have no clue. That’s that really. I was tempted to message her on Instagram but I don’t want to freak her out if she doesn’t actually want to talk to me, and I’ve tried bumble again but I have nothing in common with anyone else. 


Now I’m kind of alone, and I don’t hang out with anyone. I got upset when she deleted her account because I thought I found someone I’d finally be able to connect to, but that didn’t work out. Now I feel like an obsessive creep because I can’t really stop thinking about her.

I want to go out with my friends but its at a girls house, and my parents tend to make this very awkward any time I bring up any female interaction e.g. "" \*Insert name\* has a girlfriend "". This makes it very hard for me to ever discuss anything at all with my parents. Is there any way I can get around this awkwardness and find a way to tell them in a way that they wont be like this? Or am I just overreacting and everyone deals with this sort of awkwardness.",29Jan2019,1
81,"I feel so bad about it. I don’t want to be a hateful or spiteful person, but lately the sadness and tears have switched to anger and resentment. Wanting that same pain she put me through to come back on her 1000 fold and to never have any type of success in life. The lies, abandoning me, tossing me away like garbage after YEARS, the fact she said she cared and loved me and cared for me then acts like I don’t exist, blocked me out, like we didn’t spend two years together, like I didn’t meet the whole family, stay at her house every weekend, sit in at her work, go on a holiday with her etc. 

In less than two weeks she starts seeing some other dude and is so “happy” with him, doing things in days that took us nearly a year to build up to. It cheapens the whole experience IMO. Makes me feel like it was all contrived and a lie. Am I wrong for thinking these negative thoughts and wanting her and this new dude to have unprecedented pain and hardship? Will this pass? I really feel bad for thinking this way. I know when you “love someone” you should be happy for them no matter what, but I kinda think that’s bullshit especially if they’ve done things to hurt you, made you feel like you’re a horrible person and so “guilty” and then they just throw you aside like a jumper that’s too small.

I know many other people deal with the same problems that I used to have and I know how it feels, but I guess there is light at the end of the tunnel, but some people have longer tunnels than others.

86,"This is not a confession. (Or is it?) I don't know, I just needed to tell someone!



Yes, I am very much in love with my close friend and I don't want to pursue them romantically because I am *over* that part. 



A few years back I have confessed to them that I like them a lot. This was in high school and AFAIK most high scholers don't know how to handle complicated feelings very well. We became awkward and didn't really know how to communicate how we feel. I even became sorta angsty about my infatuation towards them. We never brought it up again, though.



Fast forward to college. I lived far away from home, but they stayed in our city.  I still have feelings, but I managed to keep it chill. However, things have gone south with regards to my mental health. I am currently anxious and depressed and have had more breakdowns and panic attacks than I can count with my fingers and toes. During my stay in uni, our ""chats"" have become more frequent. Even during the most mentally trying times of my life, they were present to give me support and love. When I finally went home to make time for myself to heal mentally, this person made time to help me accept and understand my situation. 



I have considered myself very lucky to have loved someone like them in high school, but I felt even luckier and privileged to have them now. Their personality, disposition, and wisdom have been their best points and I admire them in the way they have become better. Before, I only liked the good characteristics, but over time I learned to appreciate and understand their worst and lowest points and have since paid extra attention for their physical and mental wellbeing. 



I know now that I love them more than the usual amount I have for my friends. I also know that they won't love me back, at least romantically, and that's okay. Seeing, or even thinking, of them makes me feel warm, safe, and hopeful. They are a great part of my world and I am more than fine to not be the same to them.



This person has taught me that love doesn't always have to be reciprocated in the same amount or kind, it just has to be given freely without asking for compensation. They are almost like family now. 



Thank you for listening, kind internet stranger. I hope you had a great day!

87,"My best friend from college ghosted me almost two years ago. We went from texting every single day to nothing all the sudden and I always thought it was something I had said or done. I missed her so much and a lot of things made me think of her and all the fun things we did in college. She stopped talking to a lot of our friends but never for more than a few months and then would occasionally pop back in their lives randomly. She apparently had her own thing going on with school and new friends (I did too and still kept in touch with my old friends though). Haven't heard from her in months and now 2 years, and she all the sudden started inviting me on facebook to these tailgates and I never went because I thought it was a messed up way to reconcile if that's what she was trying to do. She attended a party last weekend with my roommate and told her she heard I thought we were in a fight. My roommate told her ""I mean, what did you expect. She doesn't think you're in a fight, she just doesn't have positive feelings towards you right now."" My ex best friend then told her ""I want to text her because we had some good times but now that I know she's mad, it feels like it would be weird."".

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, for 2 years I believed that something was wrong with me, or that I had done something to upset her. Turns out she's just an asshole whole would sum up our friendship as ""had some good times"". I obviously saw this friendship as way more than she did. It's a relief and the closure I needed. Moral of the story, if people ghost you, it's very easy to think you did something wrong. Most of the time people just don't know how to communicate and take the easy way out. Don't stay with those people. ",29Jan2019,1

89,"High functioning anxiety is unable to control thoughts like, *why would you say that,* *nobody here likes you, you’re not good enough and you’re a bad friend.*. feeling guilt for something you did years ago. Remembering how you treat someone in year ten and that impacting you in the here and now. *You’re a bad friend. You’re a bad friend*.  Latching onto these thoughts, replaying them endlessly.  Feeling alien, like I transitioned into a monster. Feeling like I smelled bad and that no matter how often I washed I still smelt bad. Feeling paranoid with people laughing as I entered a room. Feeling unable to connect. You’re a bad friend. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I should shut myself away. Only really talking to two people in my life about how I was feeling. In classes, I hid behind fake smiles, attracted to girls who I used to be able to talk to, but suddenly the prospect of doing so filled me with dread. *You’re weak, you’re weird. How could she like a guy like you?* These thoughts were completely new to me, and I was ill-equipped to deal with them. So rather than letting these negative thoughts go, I latched onto them.  I am afraid to admit that they consumed me and made what is often the most joyous time in a Young Person’s life living torture. Months passed where I felt more and more weird, latching onto thoughts and feelings that left me isolated. 

 I must note that at this point, my anxiety had never affected my studies. I have always been very keen at answering questions posed to the class... It came to a head when a tutor, new to the university,  joined the class to replace one who had suddenly deceased. He was fresh out of school, clearly unnerved by having to stand up in front of us. Worst still, he had a tendency to stare. The lectures were a history of the revolutions and dictatorships of Central Europe. The twitchy, starey lecturer asked the question “Would you ever take part in a revolution?” which for me was completely unnerving, but as he stared he was expectant of an answer. He came to me, normally the kid who would offer him sort of a response, so I began answering his question. Whilst doing so, I was conscious of a thought entering my head.  *He’s MI5. Stop talking right now, He’s M15.* Now I was still smoking weed at this point, but I knew this thought was really strange. I researched it, and I was informed of psychosis, at this point I felt like I needed help. 

&amp;#x200B;

I spoke to minds matter (a mental health service), who immediately sent a mental health practitioner out to my house to evaluate me. Within a twenty-minute house visit, she concluded I was not suffering from psychosis. This was not a relief. *If you’re not suffering from psychosis then what the fuck is wrong with you.* The lady offered no diagnosis. 

&amp;#x200B;

Two weeks pass, when I have my second meeting. We talk about my thoughts and she tells me I have anxiety. Using a perfect analogy for me, she explained “What you are doing is experiencing a strange thought, something which everyone does, then latching onto it. Because it is so strange for you and because you can’t believe that you have thought about it, so you’ve caught it and let it consume you.  rather than doing what most people do, which is, let it go.” 

Now I'm not saying these words cured me, but they gave me a way to release the pressure and get on with living my life. ",29Jan2019,1

Since the start of September I go out with my friends and started college. For the first week I went out and would get with girls (sex with only 1)  this is what I would do every week up until 2019. I’m back at college and had my refreshers (excuse to go out) I went out 3/5 nights but after that I’m not interested in going out or girls in general anymore. Over that week a girl I ended something I had with a girl for a while, wasn’t a relationship. Still I don’t think she’s the problem as I never think about her. Just not interested in it anymore and also deleted my tinder. I honestly don’t know what’s wrong with me but it won’t go away.

93,"i have this big problem right now, and although most of it is resolved, it still find myself looking at the world through the pinhole of this problem. because my mind is so focused on it, it immediately sees things related to it in my surroundings -- and i keep thinking, what if these are all signs that my problem isnt over yet? what if the current resolution is temporary? and these thoughts consume my headspace like a background application i cant terminate. it's like, i could go on with my everyday life, but the problem is always at the back of my head.

i keep overthinking. it feeds my anxiety. and it's making my inner self chip away slowly. and it doesnt help that i believe in karma. that, if i try to be happy and not think of my problem, sadness and disappointment will come to me in the future. that's why i feel like im making myself sad and fearful on purpose? but saying that out loud sounds so wrong. i dont get myself.

because of the recent things that have happened due to the problem (which i still wont specify) cold temperature is now a trigger for my anxiety whether i like it or not. when i wake up because i feel so cold, i start shivering, and when i start shivering, i remember my problem, and when i remember my problem, i feel anxious, and when i feel anxious, i remember that one could feel nauseated from feeling anxious. so in the end, my mind controls me in my most vulnerable state. and that i could induce symptoms to myself? i dont know, man. i really dont get it.

i actually dont know why im writing this, or how i should even start or end it. all i know is, i fear for my life. and maybe writing it down where people can read it makes me feel better.",29Jan2019,1
94,"Last month I went on a date with a girl, and I bought her a drink at a cafe. 
At the time I thought it went really well and she was into me. I made her laugh, we had virtually the same interests (goth/punk music, mutual love of David Lynch films), and we were both comfortable. 

She had to leave after 2 hours to catch her bus, and we both said goodbye, and for some reason nerves got the better of me and I didn’t hug her or even ask if she’d like to do it again. Stupid. 

A week goes by, she’s on a school trip so I think she’s just busy which is cool, but then I find she just deletes her bumble. That wouldn’t be too bad, but she didn’t give me her number or anything, just abruptly eradicated our only way of contact. 

This threw me off, she travelled a long way to meet me, we talked for like 2 hours, I made her laugh a few times and we both had a nice conversation, so I’m convinced it’s because I didn’t make it seem like I was interested in her. She mentioned she’s a little self conscious so she probably got like that and deleted her account because she assumed I wasn’t into her, which wasn’t the case. I really liked her. She may not be many guys type because of the goth aesthetic and short hair, which many guys I know say is unattractive, but I adore it. If I had more confidence I’d dress like that everyday, you know?

Anyway, I was really into her, she seemed interested in me but I fucked up, again. I found her Facebook through her place of work which she told me about, and I messaged her a few days after asking if she’d still like to talk, but she didn’t get back to me - wether she saw the message or not I don’t know (Facebook hides messages from non-friends). She mentioned she hardly uses it so I have no clue. That’s that really. I was tempted to message her on Instagram but I don’t want to freak her out if she doesn’t actually want to talk to me, and I’ve tried bumble again but I have nothing in common with anyone else. 


Now I’m kind of alone, and I don’t hang out with anyone. I got upset when she deleted her account because I thought I found someone I’d finally be able to connect to, but that didn’t work out. Now I feel like an obsessive creep because I can’t really stop thinking about her.

I'm a nerdy (obviously) junior in college and I have always been the best at this game. I mean, the best. I've dominated everyone I've ever played against, to the point where it's not even fun anymore. A really cute freshman girl stopped by my friend's house with her 2 girlfriends and saw us playing, saying SHE was the best. Um, yeah okay cutie, nice try. I asked her to make it interesting. $20?

She said ""how about winner picks the terms for the loser?""

Oh this could be golden. Is she flirting with me? What will I make her do when I easily win?

And 90 minutes later around midnight, that's when I found myself running all the way back to my dorm which was about 2 miles away, across the brightly lit quad as the sprinklers were going off.
