1," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. 

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

A few days before She had sent me the other side of a city instead of her for an appointment with a letter one day because it was the 6 months stage after I called in sick to an appointment at reception when I wasn’t sick I had a job interview but I hated her so didn’t want to tell her.


I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else instead if that other place she sent me and told her i had an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself. 

Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",28Jun2019,1
2,"In the last week of school, I told my crush I like her(the last week because I had a low self-confidence because of another experience) but then she said she would think about if she likes me back and she never gave me an answer by the time the end of school, and so now I think she might have been stalling and idk what to do pls tell me, idk why, BUT IM HAVING A MENTAL BREAKDOWN!!!!!!!!",28Jun2019,1

5,"I did keto and lost 23lbs but had life happen and a vacation so I stopped. I reverted to old ways and it's fast food everyday and feeling like shit. Today I created this account so I can log myself daily, keep myself in line, and hold accountability.  Today 6/27/19 I weigh about 235, let's change that. 

The goal is to be 199 by Nov 1 2019, be in better shape,  and have more muscle mass. I enjoy working out but make excuses and even though I work 12 hours a day 6 days a week I can spend 30 minutes working out.

6,"Making peace with the present moment means making peace with ourselves, with others, and with the totality of life. Once peace with all phenomena is established, we can abide in great joy, harmony, and fulfillment. In a sense, only then do we really begin to live life to its fullest potential. To make peace with the present moment, we need a certain level of wisdom and understanding, the development of mindfulness, and deep compassion.

&amp;#x200B;

**Wisdom and Understanding**

The type of wisdom we need to develop is the understanding of Cause and Effect. The universe and everything within it abides by this law which states that every cause has an effect and every effect arises from causes and conditions. When causes and conditions come together, an outcome is created, and when those causes and conditions change or separate, the outcome ceases to be. We can observe causality everywhere, internally or externally. Internally, thoughts of love and kindness lead to ease and joy, while thoughts of anger and hatred lead to anxiety and tension. Externally, apple seeds, if given the proper conditions of sunlight, soil and water can grow into apple trees, while eating can cure our hunger and sleeping can alleviate our tiredness.

By understanding that all phenomena are conditioned from the conglomeration of preceding causes and conditions since the beginningless past, we make peace with the present moment by knowing that everything right here and now is precisely the way it is supposed to be. Immediately, we accept everything just the way it is and stop resisting against the flow of life. That’s not to say we remain passive and unmotivated to work and act for the future, we still need to do that, but it’s important first to practice joyful acceptance of all phenomena. Only then should we exercise our power and potential to influence positive change by creating wholesome and holistic causes and conditions that lead to a happier world for ourselves, our loved ones, and everyone else. We don’t need to wait for the future to experience peace and joy, it is available right now, through joyful acceptance of the present moment.

When we understand cause and effect, we learn to relinquish the blaming and complaining mind, because we realize that everything is conditioned and so no one is really to blame. For example, do we blame the people that cause us suffering or the system that influenced those people, or the culture and people that created those systems, or the parents of those people, or the environments those parents grew up in? Deeply understanding cause and effect, we realize that no one is really to blame, and there is nothing to complain about because everything right here and now is precisely the way it’s supposed to be. We no longer create resistance with the flow of life but make peace with it, and that leads to real inner peace and joy in the here and now.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mindfulness**

Making peace also requires a certain level of mindfulness because we need to be mindful of our resistance with the present moment that is causing disharmony within our mind and body. Stress, anxiety, and fear arises when there is a discrepancy between what is and what we want it to be. Not to say that we cannot work for what we want, but we must first accept what is. Mindfulness is required to be mindful of our thoughts, feelings, sensations, and emotions. Then when the body or mind is agitated, we can pinpoint the source and root cause of our discomfort. Only then can we exercise joyful acceptance to return to the flow of life and bring peace back to the present moment.

Without mindfulness, not only do we have no peace of mind, but we also don’t know the sources of our stress and anxiety and how to address these problems. Because many of us lack the mindfulness to illuminate the causes of our suffering states, people turn to escapism in the form of drugs, alcohol, television, food, and sleep as a way of distracting themselves, instead of identifying and addressing these problems. Until we develop the mindfulness to identify them and exercise joyful acceptance to make peace with them, the roots of these problems will remain forever.

Mindfulness is developed by simply being mindful. This can be done by remaining the observer of our thoughts, feelings, sensations, emotions, the surrounding phenomena, and all our actions throughout the day. Meditation is another effective way to cultivate a concentrated mind with heightened awareness. Over time, our mindfulness will grow, and we will have a greater capacity to uncover the subtler things that are stealing away our peace of mind.

&amp;#x200B;

**Deep Compassion**

Deep compassion is another essential quality to develop that helps us bring peace and joy to our lives and to the present moment. With deep compassion, we can purify all the mental defilements that create us much anger, hatred, jealousy, and anxiety. By always maintaining a mind of deep compassion, we don’t give a chance for hatred and anger to arise and infect our mind and influence our actions and speech. With the spirit of deep compassion, when what we do and say are motivated by hatred, we not only hurt the people around, but we also destroy all peace and joy within our mind.

With deep compassion as our benchmark, we are always reminded to act with gentleness, kindness, and patience. Consequently, we create a happy and harmonious vibration that people feel comfortable to be around. Internally, we are calm and relaxed, and externally, our friends and family also benefit from our presence. By practicing deep compassion, we learn to love ourselves as well as the people around, establishing joy and peace wherever we are, whatever we are doing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Making peace with the present moment is not only possible right here and now, it is also vital that we learn to practice this immediately for the sake of ourselves and the people around. To make peace, we need to develop the wisdom of understanding cause and effect, we need to cultivate strong mindfulness, and we need to practice deep compassion at all times. Understanding cause and effect helps us realize that everything right here and now is precisely the way it’s supposed to be, making it perfect in its own way. Cultivating strong mindfulness helps us realize the root causes of our stress and discomfort so that we can take appropriate measures to restore our peace of mind. Practicing deep compassion eliminates our mental defilements such as anger and hatred and replaces it with the virtuous qualities like patience, empathy, and kindness which leads to much peace and joy for ourselves and the people around.

May we all work together to create a world where happiness and harmony is the foundation and bedrock of our society. We may not always be able to change others, but we can definitely change ourselves, and the best way to start is to make peace with the present moment, with ourselves, with others, and with the totality of life itself. When our mind is peaceful, it will be reflected in everything we say and do, see and touch, and our family, friends as well as the entire universe, will benefit profoundly as a result.

Times are painful right now. There are no words to describe the emptiness I feel without you. I yearn for your touch, the clasp of your warm hands over my shoulder blades - your simple touch unlocked a part of me that I didn't think I'd ever find again. After years wondering this Earth alone, you found me in a broken state. You fixed me, loved me, fed me, clothed me, entertained me. You used to give me goosebumps when your fingers would trail lightly on my skin. But now? Right now, that part of me which seemed so familiar to me is lost in the wake, unrecognizable. It's a foreign landscape that I walk on again, and I don't even know were I'm going right now.

&amp;#x200B;

Our paths were very distinctive; intertwined together, souls in complete symbiosis. But nothing good ever lasts forever, the imbalance was too strong - the ecosystem collapsed. This whole situation is tragic for me. Not only have I lost my best friend, but the one person I promise to stay loyal to my whole life - snuffed out faster than I could even figure out what went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course! I'm the common denominator in all of this! How blind could I have been to think I had everything under control! I tightened my bootstraps daily while my ego marched me head on into disaster. Applied directly to my forehead. But I digress - in here, there is no more blame.. only agony. 

&amp;#x200B;

When you said that I was your twin flame - I didn't understand it at first, but I do now. The chaos that arrived when we were together, we could deal with so quickly. A perfect team. But the chaos that came from within us, we could never control. But don't worry anymore, because from here we need to recognize what went wrong and fix it for the next one who comes alone.

&amp;#x200B;

When you used to whisper in my ear *I love you!* \- I would think it was so cliche. But now, I'm missing the parts of you that were so detailed, so lovable, that I cannot believe I didn't realize this at first pass. Do you even want to speak to me anymore? I am extending my own disbelief. The simple fact that I am having to tell myself ""of course, she doesn't"" is a fucking curse, and the only solution is to rid myself from the face of this Earth. This whole predicament has snuck up on me like death himself.

&amp;#x200B;

But I couldn't remove myself from here - not now. There is still hope in my heart, and love to be given to you. Maybe you don't see it now, but every flower that dies in chaos is reborn in stable lands. Balance can be restored to the system, and it will. This is the only thought I have left to hold on to. It keeps me going, next to reading the notes you wrote me in pure love. Our pictures  are so painful that I cannot bear to witness them - but I take great comfort knowing the memories are there, and we made them ourselves.  But one thing I know that is true - I would be more lost if you had never found me than if I had ever lived without you.

&amp;#x200B;

If it's not here and soon, it's later and in the next life that I will be with you again. My twin flame. The light at the end of my tunnel. One day I will meet with you in another plane of existence, and there we can share happiness again. Like a true family, without fault, and without pain - no more struggling.

&amp;#x200B;

I would end this by writing *I'm sorry, I love you -* but I know this means nothing to you right now. Stay strong in spirit, face the wind, love yourself. I will be here, waiting for you. If not this life - the next. There is nothing on this Earth that will fix what I've done, but perhaps we can take our business elsewhere.

13,"I smashed a glass against the wall while having an argument with my SO. I have anger issues that cross everything trying to block them (at one point I've even gotten mad while high on opiates).
I have nothing to be mad about; I don't have image issues, I got money, a girl who loves me and a great family.
It's just when I get unnerved I can't see nothing but black until I break something. I've had to pay a lot for the damage I did in my parents house.
It's only after I saw the whole in a wall is when I sort of calmed down.
I have a lot of repressed rage that keeps building up until I snap and just lose it.
If I repress it I spontaneously fantasize about torturing animals or people and I swear to my own life I really don't mean any harm to anyone but if I don't act out my aggression with either self harm or breaking shit I become extremely sinister. Idk what to do tbh",28Jun2019,1

so i continue walking up the hill, cursing that i didnt turn around sooner, wishing i had my phone on me to call someone to rescue me, and i start gagging. after a few teases, i eventually puke in someones yard and just....keep walking. i felt a little better after that but the whole walk home i was in a fugue state

21,"I don't really know where exactly to post this, so I figured I put it here since it's more general. Essentially, an older man (probably in his early to mid 30's) started coming to my church a couple of years ago. I was about 15 or 16 at the time and had a part time job working in the nursery. I basically just watched kids, but it was rare for one to come in so I was normally alone. I met this man when I was on my way to meet back up with my family after service was over. He seemed very nice and shook my hand, and introduced himself as John. The next time I came to church, I ran into him again on my way to the nursery. He didn't seem to remember me because he shook my hand and introduced himself again, but this time as Matthew. He followed me to the nursery and proceeded to talk to me for the rest of the time church was in service. The way he talked and acted was very strange. He had intense prolonged eye contact and would ask random, yet personal questions. He didn't seem to know any social cues. I felt very uncomfortable, because I was a tiny girl and this was a man twice my size and age, so it was definitely not an ideal situation for me.  He didn't necessarily do anything bad, but I was still afraid of him. I asked someone else if they could stay with me in the nursery from the next Sunday, which helped a lot with making me feel safe. She would initiate conversations with him, but he would start talking to me after he answered her questions. I was very short with my responses to him, so it's not like talking to me was interesting. She agreed that he acted very odd, and said she'd continue staying with me until he stopped coming. One day, the woman didn't come to church so I was alone again, so I decided that I would hide from the man until he thought I wasn't there. I hid in a different room than I was normally in, behind a big fake wall (like one used in theatre) and just tried to listen for his footsteps. I didn't even hear him, but out of no where he showed up behind the wall and started talking to me like normal. I pretended I was cleaning, but I was freaking out because I was legitimately cornered and would be helpless if he tried anything. He kept talking for about 5 to 10 minutes, despite me not really answering, until finally I said I needed to go to the restroom and just didn't come back. I was so scared and stopped going to that church because I was so afraid of running into him again. Everyone said he stopped coming shortly after I left, but would show up every once in a while. I'm 21 now, and started going to that church again from time to time just to accompany my mom, but I'm still very scared that he'll come back when I'm there. I don't think he's actually dangerous, so I don't think it's necessary to take any actions against him, but in the case that I come across him or someone like him again, what's the best way of handling it? I just want to be able to communicate my discomfort without hurting their feelings or prompting them to get mad at me.",28Jun2019,1

23,"Where do I begin.. I suppose there is a lot in my post title to digest and wonder about.

Well the preteen experiences were with a teenage family friend. And I say they influenced because he along with others in my life (family and friends) used to bash gays or make fun of and use terms towards each other in a derogatory way. It was never ok to be gay the way they made it seem and act, not ok to like a guy, rude comments if guys kissed or anything in a movie, etc. And this teen let’s call him H was always a part of that and being one of the oldest in our friend circle he had more Influence and experience in peoples feelings. So it through me off when he made a move on me in a sexual manner. Him 16-17 me 11-12. Always one to bash and secretly he was gay or bi. It through me in a loop but I was also scared and pressured by his age and influence and threat of him telling others. 

It started with him verbally trying to get me into it by talking about hot women but him whipping out his cock and asking if I like it and want to touch it like the woman in a movie we were watching that had a sex scene. I denied and and denied and then was promised to be gifted things and persuaded in ways to my “benefit” even those it was clearly in his benefit. I eventually gave in. Hjs eventually we’re convinced into bjs with him receiving, and me trying to convince him reciprocated touch me and blow me as well because I was feeling it all be one way. He did but not in the same effort or manner or frequency. I didn’t enjoy it then, it was forced and convinced and coerced. It eventually made me hate him, hate myself, and hate that part and side of me. I denied that I was bi and that it was only do to what he convinced me to do. And what I was culturally and religiously brought up with my peers and siblings. The way I was forced to think and be was straight only and that gay or bi was wrong. I hated myself and those moments and him and it made me look back on that for years. 

Eventually I did have experiences with guys but mainly women but I still denied it and hated myself and him, I blamed him for influencing me but then I started to discover myself and maybe that is just me. Maybe I’m just bi, and maybe those experiences had a factor in that and maybe they didn’t. But I now self accept it and look at it as pleasure and a turn on and attraction to men and women rather then associating my bi side to the childhood experiences. 

Self acceptance is huge and is a strong step forward anyone in their life discovering being bi, gay, straight, etc. You need to be happy with who you are before you can bring your true self to be open with others. Don’t deny who you are and want to be. Learn, discover, experience life and yourself and love yourself. 

Not seeking acceptance or sympathy with my post just an experience to share and think about that may help others. I know childhood experiences can have lifelong experiences for people whether good, bad, traumatic, happy. It can live in your mind and influence you without you even knowing it. 

I just try to enjoy life and everything in it now. It’s too short to live denying feelings or experiences or pleasure and fun. Discover yourself and share it with the world.",28Jun2019,4
24,"My boyfriend and I broke up on Friday. It was the worst breakup I have ever been through. The most traumatic by far, and that’s saying something, since I was engaged to a bi-polar man years ago and broke it off. I won’t get into the details, but it was really devastating for me and brought of sides of myself that I am ashamed of. 

On Tuesday, two of my oldest friends sat me down to tell me how manipulative and controlling they thought my ex was, and they were scared about me going back to him. They’ve never done anything like that before. It was hard to hear, but everything they said was valid and had merit. Yesterday, another friend sat me down to tell me that he had isolated me from all of my friends, broken me down, and my priorities had been out of whack since I started dating him. 

I think of myself as a very aware person. I am kind and empathetic, and a very good and giving partner. The problem was, he was a taker. Very narcissistic, but he disguised it incredibly well because he could read emotions very well. I got sucked it. 

Yesterday it hit me hard how bad things must have been for all of these people to be saying something the way they were. It was devastating. I felt like I had lost touch with reality if that’s what everyone had thought while I thought I was happy. I think I had. I was crushed. The last time I remember being so despondent was when I was suffering PTSD from an assault. I‘ve been in a truly bad place mentally the last couple of days. 

This evening, all I wanted to do was take a Xanax at 5:30 and go to sleep after having sat on my couch all day and doing no work. I reached out to my friends and everyone encouraged me to get outside and get some fresh air, so I did that instead.  I smoked a little weed and took my dogs for a walk. It was the best thing I could have possibly done for myself.  

While I was walking, I realized that I felt sorry for my ex. The lightbulb went off and everything my friends had been saying to me clicked. That was a terrible relationship for me, but in a lot of ways, I think it was a good one for him. He lives in that world and can’t escape it without doing a lot of work on himself. I don’t live there. He dragged me into his world, and that world was toxic. He wasn’t good for me at all, and had somehow convinced me that not only was he good for me, but also that I wasn’t good enough for him. 

It feels amazing to see it so clearly. To know that I’m not insane and detached from reality, or the weak and broken person he made me feel that I was. My strength came flooding back to me.

I am so amazingly grateful that I have friends who did what they did for me. It scares and saddens me that it got to that point. I need to take better care of myself in relationships, and watch out for myself more. I thought I already did that, so this is a great reminder that manipulation can seem invisible when you’re the one being manipulated. It feels so good to now recognize what was happening and feel like I have my power back.",28Jun2019,784

28,"Every other Thursday my dad's band holds a little event where people can bring their own instruments and play the blues. Anyway, my mom organizes this event however since she got a flat tire and hour out of town me and my dad had to set up and organize the entire thing. The turnout is around sixty people made for an area that usually holds 20 so it's packed to say the least. My dad didn't do much planning so I essentially had to do *everything*. Normally I just setup and break everything down. This time I made sure everyone was having a chance to play, know what's going on, small talk, check everything, figure out how to set ip three different kinds of instruments. it was more than I usually handle. I'm sixteen and she expects me to handle everything stress free when she has to drink to not be stressed about it. She at least has something to help calm her down. I get to sit there and boil. I've almost had a panic attack twice because of everything that was just thrown upon me.

I wish she appreciated everything I do more. Or at least said she was proud of how I was holding together instead of snapping at me because she's had a bad day.

I hope she reads this just to know how I feel. This'll probably fall through the cracks or she just won't read it. God this something I needed to write down. If say this to her she'll just interrupt me and talk about how much she works and how this is'nt a lot or something along those lines. If only she understood.",28Jun2019,1

I realize that's how life works but it just seems that I'm never able to connect to people as easily as others do. I could know someone for years and they'd still know the most basic things about me. I don't find it difficult to talk to people, I'm not antisocial, I just feel like a background character in everyone's lives. People don't go out of their way to reach out to me. I just don't feel important. Nowadays, I feel extremely uncomfortable when I feel myself becoming close to someone. I somehow end up distancing myself and I don't know why. Perhaps I'm an individualist or maybe I am just selfish? I just don't want to be lonely. Some days it becomes suffocating. I just turned 20 a week ago and I'm worried I'd feel like this all my life.

37,"Xpost from r/legaladvice and where the post recieved a few condescending and unhelpful comments then was locked within 30 minutes. Below is a modified version of that post, but fist I want to be clear about what I am asking. How and where can I find attorneys to help me? Also, I'm seeking general advice and encouragement. The armchair psychiatric diagnoses are hurtful and unhelpful. My experiences are legitimate and I'm just trying to to be open and authentic about how intimidating the circumstances feel. If you don't believe me fine, just say that and maybe provide me the evidence that brought you to that conclusion. Otherwise please offer me the benefit of doubt and respond with something that will help me address these problems. 

I've suffered medical injury and malpractice, legal malpractice, lost my job, savings, farm business, and most friends and family have been turned against me. Every day I lose thousands of dollars, my emergency fund is drained. Now I have trouble concentrating and suffer from anxiety. I've given up on my farm and IT career. I'm trying to file bankruptcy, liquidate my estate and donate my remaining property to charity, or possibly a trust for last remaining friends' children. 

My most immediate threats are the stalker and bailing me out of jail if for some reason I am arrested on my way to NYC to find sanctuary and recover at a friends. I've begged attorneys to take my money, I offer $250 an hour just to listen to parts of my story but everyone is too busy, never in the office, dealing with other clients, doesn't handle cases like mine, or sit tight and we'll get back to you. The only helpful person was a nice lady from Puerto Rico I found at the New York City bar association, which I called out of desperation. She helped me form the escape plan and how to become a NYC resident. I have no idea what I am doing or who to turn to. 

(At this point in the post I narrated an admittedly lengthy aside in an attempt to describe my feelings of exhaustion, and the how the seemingly minor hurdles of making a Reddit post can add up until one simply gives up on the site. It was supposed to be a social comment on the modern state of the Internet, social media, the effects of the cybercrime epidemic on the usability of the web and the overwhelming bombardment of information we face as a digital society. I guess it just made people think I'm crazy. Check it out on my original post if you are interested in reading a snapshot experience of such things. Link to xpost is a little further down)

recently, my boyfriend slept over at my house. (first time) now, we call occasionally and i see him fall asleep or hear him mumble my name in his sleep, which i absolutely MELT over, don't get me wrong... buuuut, 

when i woke up and i saw that boy, still sleeping peacefully, with all our pillows on the floor from the casual moving around in his sleep...

i knew i wanted to marry him and protect him for the rest of my life right then and there. ive never been happier in my life... when i first met him, i was legitimately such a sad sack of a human that i don't know how he still took interest in me, but i am so glad that he did because i am going to make that boy mine one day. permanently, officially, as his wife :))

maybe this sounds dumb to be so happy over, 'so what, he just slept over,' right? no. i imagined waking up next to that face for the rest of my life, making him breakfast with all his favorite foods and his favorite mango juice, being able to throw my arms around him every day. maybe getting a furry husky friend and everything !!

45,"I understand this doesn't apply equally to Yetis but Yetis being huge and all one has to wonder what the hell is it doing so high up in the snowy mountains where theres like no food, certainly not enough for an animal as big as a Yeti. Maybe they eat lost climbers that froze to death but people did find a frozen baby mammoth that one time which has to be the most caloric dense thing thats been around that area since that baby froze died so if Yetis eat dead frozen animals then they definitely missed that jackpot for literally thousands of years. And if we are to believe Yetis survive in the conditions of their natural habitat then they would have most likely ate everything and anything they can. My guess is reported sightings of Yetis are just bears that got lost the blizzard mountains and standing up on their hind legs to see what the hell is going on and also to get rid of the excess snow build up from their fur, giving them an bulk in their size from the snow, which might appear like Yeti to people doing their best not to go to hypothermia and furiously sucking on their oxygen tanks

47,"I've heard that over and over again since high school. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first time was from an English teacher when I was 17. My parents had come to school to meet with classes and gauge how I was doing. I had never been a good student. Capable, yes. But far from cooperative. I sat in the corner waiting for my parents to finish with Mr. Black, expecting rage and disappointment. Instead I got silence and confusion. It seems like Mr. Black had given some insight that caught them off guard. They'd heard the usual phrases; screws around in class, constantly late, doesn't turn in assignments, etc. But Mr. Black pinpointed a character flaw. ""He's incredibly hard to read and its terrifying. It's like he just doesn't care."" And this was a teacher I got along with. He went on to tell my parents that despite my grades, I was far ahead of my classmates and he really hoped I'd go to college. I didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

Im 29 now. And being ""hard to read"" has been a constant issue for me. It frustrates people. Mainly women. They can't tell if my subtle glimpses of emotion are genuine or forced. It definitely keeps them interested at least. 

&amp;#x200B;

The truth is, I really don't care very much. And I don't know how to show when I do. I lose interest in things quickly. But when I challenge myself, I get anxiety. So this leads to a life of comfortability. I just wonder what it'd be like to have a preference. To actually know what you want and just make that decision. Instead of coasting by on whatever decision has the most momentum. Be it something small like what to make for dinner or big like if I should quit my job. More often than not, I just don't really care.

56,"I’ve been seeing this girl for the past three months. And what can I say other than she’s amazing. I am attracted to her for so many reasons. She’s physically attractive, smart, kind, funny. The typical stereotypes that you expect people to say when you ask them why they feel the way they do about their partner. She ticks a lot of those boxes for me. Maybe it’s just infatuation, but we’ll leave it there for now. I enjoy every moment I spend with her. Those times are genuinely going to be engrained as some of the best parts of this year. 

Moving on, after our last date, I asked if she had been seeing any one else, to which she replied she hadn’t and she asked the same of me and I told her I hadn’t. Then I asked whether or not she had considered if she wants to be exclusive with me and she said she didn’t know and she needed time to think about it. Which is understandable. 

Today she asked if we could meet up in a few days time for a coffee and a chat. 

And reddit, I’m scared. When I read that message, my heart sank. I know she could say that she wants to move forward and give things a try. But my gut feeling is that she doesn’t feel the same way I do. And I’m so afraid that I’m going to hear that come from her mouth. That I’m going to again be in a spot where I gave my heart away too easily again. And I’m not going to make it out this time. I can’t blame her for having her reasons if it turns out to be the case.

I’m scared because the last time I was put in to this type of scenario, I wasn’t going to make it through the night if my friends weren’t there.  

I’m scared that I’m going to end up in such a deep hole of disappointment and self loathing that all the progress I’ve made since all those years ago.

I know that things might actually go the way I want, and that I could walk away that day in a better place. But I guess I’m avoiding getting my hopes up because my gut feeling says not to. 

I know I’ll one day be able to look forward and appreciate the good times but for now, I am filled with nerves and dread.

58,"I am 27 now but when I was 21 I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Which has lead me on a uphill battle of regaining my health. Recently, (a year and half ago) I graduated college with a food science degree and scored a job at a cannabis food lab. Anyway, when I first started I noticed some bad body odor (foul breath and others we will not mention on here) and got worse from the stress of being in a new city and new job. Everyone around me started to notice. People from work, the grocery store, people on the airplane. Everyone at my work started to make side comments or talk behind my back all the time including my so called ""friends"" that I had made there. To the point of suicidal thoughts and such. I never really had self coincidence to begin with but now it seems like I am in the negative. In order to correct this foul body odor I have been going to a functional medicine doctor for about 3 months (because conventional doctors didn't ever give me answer as to why this was happening so they just kept giving antibiotics to the point where they didn't work anymore). In the 3 months I have been seeing my new doctor I have changed my lifestyle and started to feel happier but not completely myself (still feel like people completely avoid or do something in order not to come close enough to smell me). I feel as though it is time to move on from this job because I feel like they are the reason why I am not myself anymore (super happy and energetic) but i don't want to get another job and the same thing happen. What should I do? Should I get a new job? Stay at this job till I am healthy? 

Thank you all in advance from the bottom of my heart. I have been hiding for over a year and half now and I miss parts of my old self so thank you truly.

I forgot to mention: I have been to the dentist to address the foul breath and all they gave me antibiotic mouthwash (didn't even know it existed). Yes, I shower everyday and brush my teeth 3 times a day. Anything hygiene related that you are suppose to do,I do. I promise.

62," 

Hey everyone!

I have got got to ask for advice, vent and rant at the same time, i am confused young adult and would much rather stay twelve for ever.

Backstory time!  
So basically, most of my childhood was... well specific. I am a person with impaired sight (currently sitting on \~ -16 diopter) and due to that i had to spend my early days in hospital that was 7h drive from home. I do not remember for how long that was, but i don't even want to know how exhausting that had to be to my parents. I come from Poland and my family comes from lower middle class, so i don't even know how they afforded fuel for these tirps.

Due to my problems with sight i was put in special school for people with sight problems. Through out the years i have learned how deep the rabbit hole goes and after finishing high school avoid the place. Kids being kids - have been bullied for having good grades and since there wasn't many kids (max 12 per grade) it was hard to find any friends. Had some luck to meet one of my current friends through friends' friends' (this was middle school). Since my parents did not want me going out alone nowhere not to get hit by a car or smth (this only changed in high school) i spent most of my days playing video games. Through video games i met my current (long IRL) friends. Went to airsoft camp, met few more friends. We're like family now.

Well, one of the problems is that it turned out i was gay, suddenly fell in love with one of my friends. Got depressed, turned out the friend was depressed too, but he was straight and wanted nothing to do with my love. He didn't run though - supported each other, though i was still in love and got more depressed afterwards, no one know except him and two of my friends. Pulled through it, but lost 3 years of life doing nothing just because i couldn't cope with someone's decision, great. Also fricked up my circadian clock for idk how long, still didn't get fixed (5 years is it?) by sleeping for 3-4 hrs/day. Very smart. At least pulled through and not on meds, turns out friendship can do miracles.

My Mom was and is a great woman but not the best parent, so is my father. My father is a priest (lutheran) and mom helps him with the church. This is another rabbit hole shit frick place, that made me hate church over all, not due to religion itself. Dad was never a Role model, nor was mom. My parent's were not all that invested. Didn't try to help me find my talents, my shitty school didn't either. At least i knew i wanted to do something with computers, turns out i only half-right.

So i have completed the shitty high school and passed a matura (maturity exam, smth like A-levels) with mediocre grades, though i applied way more knowledge than my school taught me, Oh wait, it was cuz i learnt nearly nothing there, most (not every) teachers and head master were busy making students miserable and not try to even attempt the matura cuz funds would be cut due to high failure rate. So they taught us basics of basics, most of my classmates had problems with quadratic equations and similar crap.

Applied ofr IT on Uni, got declined, when i was out of home for a trip with friends got SMSed by my parents that i have been accept to an Uni degree course i really didn't want to do (wanted to do a gap year to get my A-levels grades sorted out and apply once again, got into Business management instead of IT engineering), but thety wanted me to have a higher education no matter what degree it was. When i came home and argued with parents, things gout ugly, ended up punching my father through door's window, whole hand in blood but it was hell 'a worth it.

Since i have been screed over, decided to try and make the best of it. I was keen on 3D modeling at the time, even made some money and that was something to me since all i had was like 40-50 USD (current monetary value) to spend on stuff (meals outside of home, video games, cinema etc.) So thought - yeah, well, so i will start my 3D CG company.

Degree's first semester started, turned out that tutors liked me, i guess i am charismatic or smth and have my marbles intact, i am not quite sure about it, but still - this experience helped me a lot (yeah ikr, turns out going to Uni even on a shitty subject helped me to cope with my half baked body and social awkwardness just a bit - parents had no clue i had these problems in the first place sooo... yeah).

During First year of Uni i have came across show called Gravity Falls, binged it and realized that seclusion of special schools made me miss so much stuff and that i did not really learn much through out the years. 40 episodes of cartoon taught me more about social life than anything before. Actually, i have enjoyed this cartoon so much that i was interested if 'kids' shows' these days were all clever. Ended up binging through The amazing world of gumball and by accident lit a spark that led me to finding my passion.

Cartoons helped me to recover fully from depression, turns out i enjoyed them so much, that i found myself scribbling theories, drawing and thinking that drawing cartoons would be great. Since i did some 3D stuff and knew my way around tech, i have picked up a small Waccom tablet during third semester. I wasn't all that great at drawing, but enjoyed it quite a lot. And it was decided - though the BM degree wasn't teaching me all that much about starting ur own company (still disappointed after graduating \[not exactly graduating, will get back to this later\]), i have started planning and researching my options. Turns out that to study animation i have one Uni in Poland, since Unis are free here, i was heart broken to learn that i am screed and could never afford studying in UK, Canada or US. Oh and turns out you need to already be good at drawing.

During that time i fell in love again, another friend, turns out he wasn't gay neither. Heart broken again but at least i made my best friend be more of a brother to his brother and my ex crush, so at least something positive came out of it. Still - felt empty afterwards. Never opted for casual sex, i find it disgusting (to me, others might do as they please, it's heir life). And since Poland is really... well homophobic does not describe it all that well - country, finding a boyfriend was a hard task. Been let down by ppl few times, and grew colder although the kind of empty feeling allowed me to enjoy stuff and ppl that i have in my life more.

Anyways - first order of business, after learning that i need to learn to draw and i need to learn good, i found a teacher, which actually works with my crappy eyesight and believes in my potential. I am still learning, slowly, but i am determined.

And now we are getting to my current situation.

I have passed all my subjects, but since i did not complete my bachelor thesis in time (due to frickton of stuff to do in last semester like there was no other TIME to put these god damn subjects) and Uni does not even give a damn so i'll have to pay them so i can finish it at a later date, because frick you, nobody cares that you guys had to learn during this semester, could've wrote your thesis in first semester lolz. Turns out that 50% of people who passed all the subjects are in the same shit hole as i am. GJ Uni. The worst part is that i didn't really learn any practical stuff - still don't know how to start from scratch,does not matter that i do have a know how to start a CG company if i don't know how to work through many problems and tons of paperwork. Reading about it leaves me with more questions than answers too.

Oh hey, it also appears that i have met my current boyfriend (firs relationship) in March and i don't know anything about relationships because i have not been in any due to being anti social AF. BF is really sweet an kind, though i have a lot of doubts. I am not quite sure if i am even capable of love anymore. I feel empty, Really empty and in the bad way. The fact that i am attracted to other men is not helping. I think that my brain is currently functioning like a brain of a 15YO boy. I feel about my BF like about a good friend and that is bad. I don't want to hurt him, i'd really want to feel the chemistry. Maybe the fact that he is attractive, but not all that much comparing to my ex crushes and some other ppl that i see roaming the sreets, does not help (i know this sounds flat, it makes me feel even worse). We'll be moving together in a month, i want to give it a try and make it work, but i am worried that i am broken beyond repair... And i really don't want to hurt him, he's been so kind and supporting. He knows that i feel numb, but i am worried that he does not understand fully, how numb i feel. But on a contact level - we click really well, do have common interests and enjoy each other's company. I guess he is a bit broken when it comes to relationships too tough. Only time will show, but i am open to advices and real experience since this had been bothering me lately and actually was the biggest reason to write all of this.. ♫ *i don't know where i'll end up but i will find it some day* ♫, aye?

Eye sight is harvesting it's crops though, turns out that even though i found ways around problems in a limited environment like Uni, normal life is gonna be tough. No option to get driver's license, can't really drive a bike due to some balance issues crap too. Reading stuff is hard and there is a lot of reading of paperwork, food labels etc. Good thing i am not alone. Learning to draw fast is hard too so exams will be pain in the but if i will try to study Animation. But isn't the worst. Because i do a 'giraffe' with my neck all day, my arms and necks are so tense, that i am struggling with chronic pain, gonna visit the physiotherapist when i'll find funds, i know that such things don't heal by themselves, however our government believes so and the sky high taxes are defrauded by politicians instead of being used to help hospitals and hire more public doctors (doctors don't really want to work in social hospitals because the pay is really low to the point where their education earns them as much money as a technician after tech high school earns (specialized school type with extra year that teaches you a profession). But will get around and find my way, as usual.

Since taxes are insane i can't start the company here too - i'd drown under monthly costs that are charged regardless if i earn money or not, Social insurance is a flat cost for every company / employee (depends on formal form of a business). So i thought of going to an English speaking country (aiming for Canada or US) after finishing Animation or even before, to earn money and study it in one of the countries mentioned.

I'll be moving from my parents' soon and even though i didn't think that would be the case, i am feeling home sick already, i guess this is due to moving from comfortable, easy, childish life into the adolescence. I feel really hopeless and doubtful tbh. But it will probably fade away as mundane tasks will keep me occupied.

Good (and the other) people of reddit. Am i the one that is srlsly mentalny ill or is it going to get worse like everything that you learn more about?

Sorry for this, if ANYBODY reed all of this, you are a titanic person full of patience and compassion, or you just hate people and want to torpedo bomb everything i siad, in that case i am happy too because i have waster at least few minutes of your life, and your sarcastic comment's won't bodge me at all ;) Have nice day either way.

TL;DR - i am hurt in the head and can't think like a regular person, world is cruel but somehow i still enjoy it and cope with stuff. WTF is this, reddit? :D

Either way, advice to make the ceiling flat again is totally welcome

63,"I work as a janitor in a unionized factory. I almost have enough time there to sign up for a new position. Janitorial duties are the lowest wage and it seems like I have the most physical labor out of all the other positions and I work nights. People are pigs they spit and shit everywhere and leave their things out in the locker rooms. I only have 8 hours a night to clean and it's not my fault they don't have industrial cleaners... I have to use a bunch of time and elbow grease to get certain things clean...and if I have to focus on everything all by myself every night it's not enough time. I just had a talking to with a boss due to 3 specific things not being clean enough, and all of them are at the fault of me as well as people being inconsiderate pigs. I have to scrub rust off of shower hardware, why is it rusting in the first place?!?! Certain things wouldn't be a problem if people weren't being so shitty and disgusting. I have 6 bathrooms, 2 shower areas, and 2 locker rooms to clean top to bottom with repeat tasks every single day.

I feel like I'm a disappointment to my parents. I even wonder if they really care about me. I got my results back from my finals, which are major exams here. I have pretty good grades considering that I've attended one of the hardest schools in the state. I'm not a perfect student and there are definitely better ones than me, but I can't say that I'm not incredibly proud of myself, or was proud of myself. My mother thinks differently though. ""At least you passed"" she said, without looking at me once. I felt the joy and pride slowly crumbling. I'm self-conscious, but I really hoped that at least she would be a bit happy. I don't have many people in my life to make proud. I'm seen as the child who HAS to be an overachiever, I have to make up for what my siblings couldn't achieve. I feel so much pressure.

So i have always been kind of addicted to spending hours, weeks and even months in my head. Its all bullshit, i know it is, i know it is my biggest flaw and what keeps me back the most. It can be like a fake scenario where i have done something bad, i imagine everyone hating me and eventually killing myself or something, and i repeat this fake story over and over again. I feel a need to finish the story or keep the story straight, like im making a movie or something.

First memory of this was when i was a little kid, i had a lot of energy and would even get these huge energy bursts. I remember laying in bed having an extremely active mind, i wanted to sleep so i tough up something sad like my mother dying or something until i actually was crying then fell asleep. Guess i thought it was easier to fall asleep when i was sad, less energy or something ... Another thing i would do was to convince myself of something really sad then ""realize"" it wasn't true so that i would get a rush of relief or something.

So i fucked around with how flexible the mind is, how i could think about something like becoming famous or rich. This can give me an extremely nice feeling, it feels real and i often catch myself grinning like crazy.

Later when i was in the 1 - 5 grade i spent so much time in my head thinking about fake shit that i wasnt paying attention on anything. 99% of the time i would say i was in my own head. Then i got extremely depressed from 5 - 10 grade to the point of suicidal toughts everyday. One day i realized how crazy it was to spend all this energy making myself feel shitty so i slowly got better.

At one point, when i was 15 i ordered an MRI for my brain, they said i had irregular brainwaves but that its wasnt unusual. I tried reaching out several times for help because i was sure there was something wrong with how much toughts affect me.

Well now im 25 and i would like to quit once and for all. I saw a therapist once who told me its not the content thats the problem but the thoughts itself, which i understand. I get that its all bullshit, but i seem to be addicted and not able to quit doing it.

When i feel good i feel 1000x times better than normal, its like discovering my true self. I will be stuck in my head for months and get super depressed, then suddenly have a great day where my mind is clear and people almost dont recognize me.

I am currently working with my own business, and also another which i own parts of. I have to be focused, i was able to focus the first year, but in the last months i just cant seem to get in a good routine. I work out every-other day, eat healthy, stay social but i struggle when im alone.

I stay up late thinking these bullshit scenarios until my head is tired, i wake up too late, then i blame myself and keep spending all this time in my head again. If i start having a good idea i feel really shitty for not having this kind of good day the last month i should have ... If i keep going i know im going to get depressed again.

I love reading the comment section on reddit because i always learn a lot. Do anyone have some insight to share?

EDIT: And i also procrastinate like crazy and use the toughs as excuse. Like i have to think about the perfect thing or get a clear picture of the contents of my head before i start something.

And the thoughts can be literally anything, im picking up a glass of water and then i just stop and start thinking about something, its like everything i do goes trough a filter.",28Jun2019,7

This needs to change, this isn't a pity party for me or anything, I'm doing really well and in treatment, but that has only opened my eyes to how hard this really is and how little people understand. It's hard, when youre in the throws of being extremely underweight the poor nutrition destroys your brain, I remember forgetting normal words like what a refrigerator is, or the wheel part of a tire. I woke up every morning shaking and gagging as my mouth started to salivate until I violently puked up all of the stomach acid because even that was too much for my stomach, it wanted to be empty so bad. Hunger completely dissapears there is no such thing it's replaced by nausea and mental breakdowns for everything but hunger, I was constantly crying because I was not enough, a piece of shit, worth nothing, incompetent and completely incapable, I was just hungry. My brain stomach  and body were all broken, completely. I was a fucking ghost, a shell of a human being that felt like nothing, even though I was full of feelings, pain, suffering, fear. I was feeling all of those things and still convinced I was nothing. That's all behind me (hopefully) treatment/recovery is necessary and amazing but just as difficult as being without it, the hardships of being thin are replaced by hardships of eating nonstop, the cure for the diseases that brings up all your trauma and makes you stop eating is to eat and go head first into all your trauma. My meal plan started remotely small but now I'm consuming about 2500 calories a day as a male that is 5'11"" and 117 pounds, ouch, you spend your days constantly feeling like you've just eaten Thanksgiving dinner, and like your traumas all just happened because they are all brought up often to be worked through. It's been hell, but Im here and fighting, fighting myself and it's hard. If you know anyone struggling just try and listen to what they have to say.

Why do we need to take their capabilities? Why can't they be capable, strong and sovereign?

Why are people making toys out of living creatures? 

Can you imagine having a child and always providing them with love and care and never letting them grow up and become a strong independent individual? 

Like everyone wants women to be strong, independent individuals. And they should, so should men and humans in general because you are only alive when you know that you can handle life. Now you will never be 100% sovereign because thats technically impossible but do you want to be dependent on your mom when you are 27?

Then why do we do this to animals? Are they toys? Why can't they just be left alone to live their lives and to fight life as every creature has to so that they can look at them selves as someone who is at least somewhat capable.

that said, we are still cool with each other, i mess with her sometimes ( in a friend way not mixing feelings or whatever ) and thats all cool.

she often switch spots because our supervisors tell her too ( just a matter of placing nothing else ) and when she's close to me, ( like RIGHT NOW ) she keeps looking behind and standing up to look behind at me.  


i'm being serious, i'm not the only one who noticed, several people did it too by now.

i asked her to stop once and she told me '' oh im not looking at you, its just the way i focus! '', well it's pretty obvious that its not because she does not do this when shes far away from me.

87,"Last year my family of 5 was living in a nice 4 bedroom house in a decent neighborhood. I am the oldest of 3 siblings.  Our parents were never married but have been together for 25 years. This is the story of the end and a new beginning.

Tldr at bottom

Nothing has ever been smooth sailing for us. My parents were on and off, but had never been truly separated. My mom didn't work for the longest time,just a few short term jobs. Mostly wanting to stay home taking care of the kids. My dad was the primary bread winner. Doing painting, construction, working for himself mostly. I used to work with him but I will never again. They argued almost every day. Towards the end, the stopped talking to each other. They only communicated in arguements. My dad would stay out late to avoid coming home, to an argument, about where he was all day and why is he home so late. It was a deadly cycle. He also had no relationship with my siblings. He almost never talked to them, and when my brother would want to, he would get told to go play.  Me and my siblings dreaded my dad coming home. He was never physical with them, but he was with my mom from time to time. Only physical with me when I had to stand up for myself or her. But that's not what this story is about. 

My mom was depressed, and stayed in her room all day. She refused to cook or clean or do anything. My dad was abusing drugs and not paying the bills. Our water bill was 2000$ and we were 7000$ behind on rent, in July 2018 we were evicted, and put as much of our stuff into storage as possible. We lived in hotels for a while, and my mom couldn't take it anymore and took my brother and sister to live with my grandma. My dad remained homeless, because my grandparents hated him and wouldn't let him stay.

We couldn't maintain the storage units so we grabbed everything that was important in the few days before they were locked from us. We lost everything else. 

In October, Hurricane Micheal devastated parts of Florida. Seeing this as the opportunity of a life time, me, my best friend, and my fiance made the 1200 mile trek to Florida to help. Arrived and was homeless yet again, looking for work. We found a job with some great people, and we worked hard AF. Our bosses found a house that our crew and another crew could stay at for a while, while it was being worked on. Of course this didn't last long, and we were homeless yet again. Over a thousand miles from home, we didn't have the option to go back. And even so, there was nothing to go back to. We had to keep trying. 

Me and my fiance lived in our van for a month longer, when we received a blessing from one of our coworkers. He was moving and had to find a new tenant for his landlord and recommended us. We were so happy and accepted, not even caring what the house looked like. He left behind some furniture for us and we moved in. It's a small manufactured house, but it's perfect.  Big yard, Surrounded by trees. Circular driveway. And for so cheap. We have been living here for a few months now, and my parents made life look so much harder than it is. Our bills are easy. And life is getting much much better. 

Meanwhile back home, my dad started hanging out with younger people my age. Doing drugs with the crowd of people I knew about and chose not to associate with because of their tendencies. Supposedly he started a sexual relationship with a girl my age. This sickened me to the core. Not only that, but he also had a girlfriend he refused to tell my mom about, as he still pretended they were together. His girl said she would break up with him if he didn't tell her, so he told my mom and broke her heart. And then his girl left him anyway. He emotionally destroyed my mom for the last time.  

The original plan was to send for my dad, so he could come and work with us and put the pieces back together. No longer was this the case. My mom and siblings planned on coming here for a vacation, and when she told me all that, I told her I wanted her to stay with me, so she could be happy and as far away from him as possible. She was overjoyed. She couldn't breathe she was so excited.

I stopped talking to my dad after I heard all this. I also heard he caught himself a drug charge and is now on probation so he couldn't even come here even if he wanted to. He didn't believe my mom would go anywhere ""you're too lazy to even go to the store,"" he said.

My mom and siblings are packing their things right now and are headed out early this Saturday morning to drive 14 hours to come live with me. Although my house is small, it's enough to accommodate everyone's needs, happily. I'm so excited to show my mom the best time of her life. For the first time in 25 years, she is free and won't have to worry about a scummy man cheating on her and abusing her. She has always wanted to swim with dolphins, and swim with dolphins we shall. My siblings have never seen the ocean, this is the first time in their lives they are leaving their home state. It will be a grand adventure for us all. I have made so many fun plans. And it couldn't of been possible without my best friend, my fiance, and all of the wonderful people we have met along the way. I am so grateful, and excited for the future. 

Thank you for reading :)

for example something recent: im starting to play the guitar and the one i have its pretty low end and i want to buy a more expensive one ( something like 300 ). Let me just say that i work, pay bills and never ask anyone for nothing.


the answers i got were -


Dad  - uhg, just keep the money, save it.


Best friend - ugh that is only worth if you get some money of that hobbie, if its not the case its not worth.


people always twist their noses when i plan in doing something. 


well fuck you all im going to buy it because I WANT and I CAN.


i dont give a fuck about saving. my car is fully paid, i pay my bills, work everyday,  have some money saved and i have ""nothing else"" to do now.


i dont smoke, barely drink, i live a kinda boring always running live and i want to have some personal pleasure too.


so to you all who struggle with this kind of shit support, say a big FUCK YOU, to everyone pushing you back and go fucking be happy.


just that, thanks.",28Jun2019,7

It’s almost like I’m really high. It’s the only thing I can compare it to. 

Anyone else ever felt this way? It’s starting to scare me, my job is a delivery driver and I feel like driving could be dangerous while I’m feeling this way. I could be less aware.",28Jun2019,4

92,"I don't know if it's because I'll be 40 in less than a year, or that I've been unemployed for more than a year (downsizing) and can't find work (I've basically stopped looking), or that I'm nervous about deciding to pursue a totally new career path that will necessitate more school....but I've become overwhelmed with feelings of dread, sadness, and fear. The fear seems to be based on some notion that I'm on the verge of losing everything, but there's no reason for me to think this. I should be excited and optimistic now that I'm looking to totally change up my professional life and pursue something new, but instead I just feel isolated, lonely, and terrified. My wife and I get long very well, have a happy marriage, and I'm in very good health. 

I can't seem to concentrate on anything; I pace around, I'm restless, and I accomplish very little. I can no longer sit and read for more than a few minutes. Movies bore me. Nothing seems interesting or important. Sex has no appeal. Running is about the only thing that helps, but I can't run constantly, obviously.  

My psychologist helps somewhat, but there's only so much she can do. Same with the meds. 

Somehow I think that I'm going to wake up one day and have nothing.",28Jun2019,2

94,"First and foremost, this note is meant to be private. I’m simply organizing some thoughts that have put me in a mood lately, and don’t intend for this to be read by any of you—nor do I expect sympathy. However, maybe some small part of me does considering I’m writing this in a Facebook note that could either accidentally go public or just plain be found one day.

&amp;#x200B;

But, I thought Facebook might be a fitting place considering it sparked this “mood” of mine. And I’ll stop beating around the bush and trying to wax poetic—basically I’m really sad and lonely.

&amp;#x200B;

Not to get too /r/iamverysmart here, but I think the bulk of my conflict lies in the fact that I consider myself a well-adjusted (well, maybe okay-adjusted), rational person. Right now my feelings don’t match with what I *know*. I feel kind of worthless. I feel exasperated and exhausted. Why does it have to be so hard? Is it too much to ask for people that enjoy my company—that want to hear my thoughts and opinions on things?

&amp;#x200B;

Now, here’s the rational side. Of course it’s not too much to ask, and it’s probably hard for most people. Harder for some more than others, but hard nonetheless. The problem is that one has to put forth their own effort, and try to actually reach out and connect with people.

&amp;#x200B;

In this context, Facebook is hell. I’m a very socially anxious person, and while it’s not debilitating, I still struggle to interact with others. On Facebook I have \~200 “friends,” that are actually strangers. They are people that I used to know that no longer know me. I’ve decided to start being more active, I put out a status update hoping to spark a conversation. “Oh, he hasn’t posted in a while, let’s catch up!” Result: One like, from a recent friend of a friend. No one cares. Meanwhile, other people change profile pictures and get 30+ likes. But that’s what happens when people actually like you.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I don’t need to address the idea that likes on Facebook matter or mean anything, that is obviously ridiculous. You also are not entitled to anyone’s care or time, especially when you haven’t earned it. One post is one post in a sea of other posts. You have to make a sustained effort in order to get noticed, and it’s a two way street. You have to reach out, comment, and generally be someone people want to like. You’re the one that didn’t maintain these connections, so now you’re the one that has to build up from zero. It’s only fitting.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever me and my ex would fight, sometimes she would say something like, “if we broke up, you’d probably have a new girlfriend in a matter of weeks, if not days.” Well, haha, I “won” didn’t I? It’s been 11 years and I haven’t had a single person make me feel like you made me feel. That was the last time I felt desired and truly loved. It makes me feel pathetic that I still think about you when I know without a doubt I rarely cross your mind. It kills me that you mean more to me than I mean to you.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, this is unfair. Normal healthy people don’t ruminate on relationships long past, especially their first ones in freakin’ high school. It sure does sound a bit pathetic. The past is in the past, there’s no changing it so there’s no use focusing on it. Both of you were literal different people. At the same time, I think this longing just reflects a wish to return to those times when I had someone to talk to literally 24/7—that shared my interests and hobbies. I probably miss the idea of someone rather than that specific someone.

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel so small. I’m out tens of thousands of dollars with nothing to show for it. I’ve got a job that I could’ve had straight out of high school. I’ve got two good friends, maybe three or four pretty good ones. I spend all my time cooped up in my room masturbating and watching anime—which is so stereotypical it’s crossed from funny into sad. Facebook here is entirely self-destructive, it’s basically a tool people use to compare their lives to others. And mine feels pretty worthless in comparison.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s not worthless though, people’s lives don’t really have “worth,” they just *are*. I consider myself as a person with value, I help my friends, I do my job. What people show on Facebook is in no way representative of their full lives, and very rarely do people showcase their darkest moments. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate that I desperately want someone to read this. I know rationally that that is completely unfair. If I were to post this, I would instantly get a massive outpouring of support and positive comments. If I didn’t, well, that’d be pretty fucking sad wouldn’t it. At the same time, I know that that’s just what *good people* do. The majority of people aren’t going to read something by someone suffering and ignore them. But that doesn’t change the fact that that support is forced, roused to action by some sort of impetus. Without this note, there’s no reason to care.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m terrified at the idea of playing the social game. I just want to be able to message people and say “Hey, we haven’t talked in a while and I miss your company, how’s it going?” But, I’m not stupid. I know that 70% of people I send that to will be uncomfortable and think I’m a creep. Because well, yeah, I’d be being creepy. There’s no reason I should miss people I haven’t spoken to in a literal decade. And every girl I sent that to would think I was hitting on them. Instead, the “correct” plan of attack is to continue this endless chipping away at my soul as I post more and more things only to get more and more ignored. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know the answer. Go to the gym. Go somewhere regularly, so people know your face. Strike up conversations with people you see and recognize. Comment on other Facebook posts.

&amp;#x200B;

How am I supposed to comment on posts when it seems like no matter what I say I feel like I’m out of place? How can I say “I’m so happy for you!” when I wasn’t invited to their wedding? How can I “like” someone’s ‘girl’s night out’ without looking like a giant creep? What am I supposed to say when 80% of my entire feed is just stupid fucking memes?

&amp;#x200B;

One of the things that also came up in fights with my ex was that I was too sensitive. She said she and her friend hated that they were dating sensitive guys, having to pick up the pieces constantly. And I agree actually, I was pretty emotionally manipulative and sometimes leaned into the tears to try to get things to go my way. Many parts of that relationship were toxic and I played my fair part. But that mentality has bled into my being today, and now I’m confused. Right now, writing this, am I not being incredibly whiny and “sensitive”? If she were to read this, would this be the first thought in her head? Or would it be pity? Would she laugh in my face if I told her she constantly shows up in my dreams? Would she feel obligated to talk to me again? As much as I hope so, I also hope not. I’d feel pathetic, well, I’d *be* pathetic. And her friends hate me, the ones that know who I was at least. I don’t know if I deserve it or not. Obviously it’s weird to be friends with your friend’s ex.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone is reading this and is worried about me, don’t be. I don’t mean that in a mean or snarky way—I truly appreciate it. But this is just a phase. I’m vomiting words onto a keyboard. I doubt it’ll last a couple of days. I’m generally a very happy and motivated person. This is a moment of weakness. I know my concerns are simultaneously valid as well as whiny. In the coming months, I’ll work on trying to improve myself and my relationships with people. I lasted a decade without Facebook, I can live with or without it. There’s no need to try to befriend everyone I used to be friends with, they might as well be strangers now.

100,"Today I edge closer to 30. I'm not quite 30 yet, thankfully, but it's awfully close. With every passing year, I try and improve myself and this year in particular I had met someone who I felt could make a real impact on my life. But just how much, at first, I didn't even realize. 

Not only did their ideas inspire me (we both shared many, *many* interests) to expand my own knowledge on life (like starsigns, a major interest between the both of us, and writing, which I struggle with due to writer's block but they inspired me to keep at it), but they also gave me the confidence I needed to branch out of the comfort zone that I had, for so many years prior, stayed inside. I got my first tattoo just a few months ago because of it! I had confidence again to style myself in ways I would never have thought I could, and I had the self-esteem, and more importantly the *self-worth* to be better.

But we didn't start as friends. We had met through a dating app, and thus we started things romantically and gradually, things became more and more. Kissing was great. The other stuff, too. We remained friends, however, but the fun didn't stop and already we were planning on doing things, trips we wanted to go on, and they had bought me a birthday present months prior to my birthday. 

That's how immensely kind, generous, kind, and  lovely this person was, and at first my gut didn't like it at all. It wasn't something I was used to, as prior to this, I have had some wildly successful friendships/romances and some unsuccessful ones that ended similarly the way this one did (which I'll get to in a moment or skip down to the **TLDR**), but generosity on this scale (they had bought lingerie to wear because they knew I had a kink for white, without even questioning it.) was unlike anything I had ever encountered. 

Things were consistently good between us. Sure, we wouldn't talk as much since we decided to stay friends, but when we did, or when we hung out, it was electric. We had laughs, much fun, and we both shared an insatiable need to explore, to culture ourselves, to eat and learn. We were playful, and even last week we took a trip far from home and we enjoyed each other's company a lot. The romantic spark might have been gone, but honestly? This friendship was beginning to blossoms in ways I was excited for.

Nothing out of the ordinary. 

This week, on Monday, we had spoken. I want to clarify that the last ""argument"" we ever had was probably April. When we wanted something off our chests, we were both honest with each other, and communication between us, and our feelings, were always clear. Nothing would ever be left unsaid, and we both were comfortable exploring difficult topics we wanted to say to each other without feeling bad. The last argument was in April and like always, we put this as a ""footnote"" -- it's said, done, we both accept whatever we need to accept and the next text is us having the time of our lives again.

So when Monday comes, we're talking and we're already planning next month. Since today (which is a Friday) is my birthday, they couldn't make it work due to other plans on her end, however, so we had Wednesday. She specifically asked **me** what **I** wanted to do on Wednesday, and I told her my ideas. ""Great!"" she says, and the plan was set. On Wednesday, we will celebrate my birthday, with the presents bought (which she was genuinely excited to give me) and she was looking forward to it!

We didn't end on a bad note. We didn't leave anything to be misinterpreted. Normal.

So why on Tuesday, halfway through the day, did I notice that she had deleted her WhatsApp? It was a normal thing to happen, so I didn't think much about it, since she sometimes will delete it and then come back. I checked her Instagram, a social media website she is *addicted to*, and to my disbelief... **she wasn't on it**.

Weird.

Deleting Instagram is... not what I expected an addict of the said website to do, but okay.

I check Twitter, and we're all good. But my gut was curious just how long it'd stay, so I checked it before midnight, it was still there.

The next day, on Wednesday, on Twitter, it told me, in bold, that I had been **blocked**.

I was confused. What had I done?

I looked at WhatsApp and I re-read Monday (we hadn't spoken on Tuesday, though she was drinking from an Instagram story she had posted on Tuesday morning -- it wasn't until Tuesday evening it had been deleted), and nope, nothing was out of the ordinary.

I waited. 

Nothing came through on Wednesday, the day she was supposed to meet. 

I wait until Wednesday evening, night... Thursday comes around and still nothing... I start to get bewildered, dumbfounded even, and rage turns to more confusion. 

Today comes. 

Surely she would send me a text to say happy birthday at the every least? Nothing.

If she had deleted everything, which besides Twitter I believed to be the case, then surely she could come back to send one tiny message? 

Nothing. 

I pack my bags and I go for a trip upstate to clear my mind, but I couldn't figure any of this out, and so I resorted to tactics I'm not proud of, and I created two accounts -- one for Instagram, the other for Twitter.

I needed to know, for sure, if Instagram was actually deleted or she had blocked me there as well, and for Twitter, since blocking can sometimes be the case if they've deleted their account (though likely not, but I wanted to explore it anyway) and I found that she exists on Twitter, and on Instagram. Had been blocked on both and deleted off WhatsApp.

And so, on my birthday, and even on the week of my birthday, I lost a friend -- someone who I thought was a friend -- for absolutely no reason. 

Since honesty and openness is a policy we both abide to, and since we're consistently open to each other, it felt abrupt and strange she would do such a thing and not tell me why? She went dark a few weeks ago and she told me she was doing it, and even during the week she was supposed to be technology free, came online to tell me she was fine.

When we were having space, she would always come back and tell me she was doing well and happy to be back.

So what changed, and why am I writing this? Simple. Acceptance. 

When we became friends, I cut everything related to her out of my life. I do this, since I want to rip the band-aid off, so to speak, and move on with my life. My first mistake was not doing it completely, and I had a backup of the entire chat on my phone, including photos, the actual chat, and memories.

I deleted it, then I recovered it, but since it was the last thing connected to them, I had the courage today to finally delete it -- to be free of them completely -- and it was because I knew, for once, the truth. I might not know why they did what they did, since the behavior is completely and utter uncharacteristic and it makes absolutely no sense whatosever since there were no misunderstandings, no arguments, no tension at all, just pure fun one day, and the next, complete disappearance (not to mention if there were, you're damn right it would be brought to my attention).

Logic doesn't even comprehend it, and that's a wound that brought me here.

Despite this, I do feel good. Yes, I lost a friend and someone who left an impression on me, and yes, the good times we had together, and the memories we shared and would continue to share are now tarnished, but today is my birthday, and I'm closer to 30 and I learned the most valuable lesson of them all: sometimes you need to stay on the high ground to be the better person.

It's awful tempting to contact this person, to say something... to warn them, I guess, to let them know you're onto them... but when you're already on the high ground, why stoop down to their level knowing you'll never get back up? It's a slope and it's best on firm ground rather than an unstable one.

Being an adult is complicated... you'll lose people in your life for some reasons or another, and you'll also get some through some strange circumstances. I learned that the hard way this week, and I also learned that being a morally better person is more -- much more -- worthwhile, and that's a better birthday present I think overall.

I'm not writing this to get sympathy. I don't even want wishes. More than likely I'm writing it for myself, I guess.

**TLDR:** Title; also, I learned that being on the high ground (in this case, not stooping down to someone's level for a cheap kick in the stomach, so to speak) isn't always a nice feeling, but in the long run you'll be better for it.",28Jun2019,17

103,"I just shared my breakup with a coworker that I talk to. We do have chats about our personal lives so it’s normal (she has told me personal things too) but also, talking about it is like reopening the wound, leads you to reinterpret things and at the end of it, was it really necessary to go into all that detail?

I find myself a little worked up again when I had the situation under control. It was hard not to get into everything once you start.

104,"I'm turning 18 soon and I've never been in a relationship. In theory I know that there's still plenty of time and that it's not a priority, but all my friends are getting into relationships and it's a bit discouraging. 

One of my friends just made it official with a boy she met at a party. It's her first boyfriend but she's already all over him and even thinking about sex.

Yesterday my other friend sent a meme complaining about being single to our group chat and we laughed about it. A few hours later she suddenly has a date with the guy she's been texting and now it turns out they've kissed already. 

Another friend also has a more-than-friends situation going on with some guy.

111,"So I'm a 19 year old Indian girl who made internet friends from almost everywhere around the world since I was like 12. Initially, I just accepted the dumb arranged marriage stuff as normal and never questioned it. But when I was about 15 or 16 and talked to some of my internet friends (yeah, pretty lonely teenage years because I'm not allowed to hang out with friends) about it casually, they were really shocked. Eventually, of course, I finally saw what a monstrosity it is. But I can't question anything in my house because if I speak one word that my dad doesn't agree with, he gets really fkn pissed so it's just better to never express your views in front of him. They've put a lot of pressure on me to do well in life later and clear this really tough exam that sends you in government service. I really want to do Psychology and I decided that I'll convince my parents to let me do Masters in Psych somewhere abroad but I decided that I'd never actually come back. I'll work on the side and earn some of my own money to support myself for a while till I get a real job. You must be wondering now, why do I have to listen to them if I'm an adult? Just say no to arranged marriage? Just go abroad myself? Yeah well, that's another thing. I'm extremely financially dependent on them because over here, it's really looked down upon and shameful for the parents if their child is working part-time. And of course, my society's ass kisser of a dad would never allow me to work and earn my own money. ""We're giving you all you need."" I have about 0 bucks to my name. And don't think I ever will till I get a real job. I live in a different city for Uni so while I have the opportunity to hide and work, the logistics don't allow for it. My dorm curfew is 10:30 and my classes get over at about 6 pm. On top of that, being alone as a woman in a country like mine is in itself dangerous as fuck. And as if that wasn't enough, I have a few relatives also studying in my college and if by any chance, my parents heard through them (or anybody) they'll pull me out of school, bring me back home and get me married off right away. I am 19 years old and I'm still not allowed to go to a friend's house or even to the mall with friends or on my own (I do all of that when I'm in Uni but can't when I'm home). My mother doesn't even let me buy tampons so I can go swimming. I don't understand why she's so obsessed with controlling my hole but welp. Basically, my family is really controlling and they decide pretty much everything in my life, the only choice I was ever allowed to make for myself was choosing Psychology and that's only because the subject you studied in college doesn't matter for that exam I mentioned earlier.

Anyway, so my plan was to be a goody-two-shoes for my parents so they'll let me study abroad and initially it sounded like they were kind of starting to come around but recently my mother told me that she doubts it could happen because I'm a dumbass who gives up easily and they anyway don't have a lot of money so if I come crying back home they'd have wasted all that money over nothing. 

I really, really don't want to get married to anyone my parents arrange for me because I've seen sisters in law come to my extended family and I've seen how they're treated. On the surface it looks like they're extremely happy and lucky because their mothers in law are sweet to them but literally all they do all day is wash everybody's clothes, cook and clean for everyone. As a feminist who's dreamt of being a successful, independent woman I just can't stand even the thought of myself living a life like that for the rest of my life.

Sorry if this is long, but do you guys think I have a chance of making it out? Now my only plan is that if I'm not able to move abroad (where psychologists actually make money, unlike here) I'm going to kill myself. I get that that sounds really drastic but I'd honestly rather die than study for 20+ years only to be some family's maid and get raped by a man I don't even know (yes marital rape is legal here).",28Jun2019,5

115,"Friends for about 11 years, dated for 7. Had a good relationship. Vacations, similar interests, part of each others families... Good sex life. I made her laugh a lot. Some pretty typical relationship problems sprinkled in there... we both did or didnt do things the other person didnt agree with sometimes, but it was far, far from a bad or toxic relationship. Just a month or two ago we were talking about marriage and kids and shit like that. 

She was selling her condo (where we both lived) to buy a duplex so we both moved back in with our parents. After a few months of this, one evening while she's super drunk she tells me that maybe we shouldn't move back in together for a while. We can still date and bang and all that, just not live together. Devastated. Ask why. She incoherently lists off a bunch of percieved flaws that I have. Tell her we should talk again when shes sober, and leave. Two days later call her to set up a time to talk. She tells me over the phone shes changed her mind - two week break with no contact. This time she lists off a bunch of cliche breakup reasons like ""its not you it's me"" and ""I just need some time to work on myself."" Assures me that this isnt about other guy(s) and will still be monogamous. Not happy, but dont want to push, so I give her some space. A few days later is my bday. She texts me happy bday. Talk to friends, guys and girls. Every single one says shes cheating. 

Once the two weeks is up I text her to set up a time to talk. Trade texts for a bit. She says she needs to extend the break. I say I dont like it but we can make it work *just so long* as she is genuinely using this break to work on herself and not using it as an opportunity to bang other guy(s). Says those terms dont work for her, so she dumps me via text. Tells me she'll drop off all my shit she has on the curb. Doesn't want to see me face to face. That was about a week ago.

More devastated. Took a couple days to mourn. Hitting the gym a lot. Got on a bunch of dating apps and reconnected with a bunch of old fuck buddies and FWBs. Getting laid a few times helped but still pretty broken up about it. We're living just a couple blocks apart so she came up on my dating app feeds. Looking to hook up with new guys who have qualities like ""going somewhere"" that she thinks I dont have. ""Work on myself"" my ass.

117,"Today I learned why you don't meet adults in world of warcraft - not meant literally of course, i've met plenty of adults in WoW. You don't meet any adults because they all quit - they grow up.

I quit.

Last night whilst at a friends they somehow managed to get me to talk about something i'd buried a long time ago; honestly didn't think was that big of a deal and still don't really.

If someone told me they were going to ring the police and get the main person into trouble - i'd go to great lengths to stop them, that person is my mother afterall.

What do you think of this? I think it was reasonable, I was also too young to know much from right or wrong and in hindsight, scenes like this one have helped carve and sculpt me into who I am today.

(A bit of a bastard).

My mother when raising me and my older brother would semi-frequently have mother-meltdowns. Heh, I like that one. She'd be sick to death of hearing us fight and bicker like kids and she'd storm over and - I guess shuv me to the side quickly with some force and then go to town on my brothers face. Not with her fist but with a slap. It's not as if my brother would cry out as if he was on his last breath but he'd clearly cry out, he would have been anywhere between the age of 6 and 10. I realized when telling this to my friends that it had never happened to me; i'll tell you why. Because I knew how to work with my mother. I'm not the most mentally stable person in the world and it's not just scenes like this one that have caused it but the genes I inherited from my parents. Neither are 'fit' perfect people. They are good people, but they are not 'blonde haired blue eyes' as the expression goes. 

That was the difference between me and my brother, one of us was strong one of us was weak both mentally and pshyically. My brothers life was different to mine.

My mother then had another son, who is much younger than me. When he was just a baby, i'm not sure how old but he was in a crib I remember one night where he just wouldn't stop crying; my mother hit him till he stopped. Not dead, he was perfectly fine, but she made him realize that he is being hit because he's crying; the more he cries the more she'll hit. Even a baby can realize that, or so it seemed. All of a sudden the crying just stopped; the baby went to sleep. She didn't punch him, she slapped him. 

Now by this point my friends were pretty cold and gob-smacked; this was when I realized hang on, is this bad? 

I don't see anything wrong with any of the above, sure the pain hurt but my mother is a hard working woman who would and has done anything and everything for her children. Like any mother.

I'd like to see what other random people think of this, I had never told anyone untill last night when it accidentally came out to my friends. It was as if it was psychologically buried but, like I said. If you want to bad-mouth her go right ahead it will just be read and ignored (no offense).

I know my mother, one of the nicest people on the planet. You may not believe it, but I also don't care (no offense).

That doesn't stop my natural curiousity. My friends were shocked as if my mother should be locked up for slapping her children some 20 years ago. I can think of worse crimes done by humanity.

This all came up because i'm upset that when I was kicked out of the house my mother said she was keeping my dog - my new landlord said no pets and she thinks my dog 'wouldn't settle' in my place. My friends tell me to just march round and take her but I tell them, that's my mother, if I did that (as much as i'd like to because I love my dog) it would also mean that me and my mother would never speak again.

Over a dog.

I do love my dog, but people (yes maybe you) need to realize that dogs are not humans and they are not as important as humans. There's a big difference between a human and an animal, an animal and an insect, an insect and a microscopic organism. 

On the grand scale of things some things matter and some things don't. 

That is the difference between the strong and the weak, natural selection.

118,"When I was younger I got extremely sick and had to be hospitalized, when they put me in there they had to give me an IV and draw my blood twice in one day. Before I was admitted I was too sick to eat or drink so I was dehydrated and my veins were also collapsed for some reason(not drugs). They couldn’t get the needles in my arms like 11 or 12 times and it hurt like hell, at least to me. So I’ve had an irrational fear of needles and having blood drawn. Well today I had to go get two shots and get my blood drawn for testing. The shots hurt but I only flinched once, and when they were trying to take my blood they failed twice, no idea why. So basically I was stuck five times today and didn’t totally freak out. I know this sounds like something simple for a normal person but it just makes me feel better knowing I was only scared cause I was sick.",28Jun2019,1
119,"I’m so genuinely horrified of social media. My struggle with that is that I’m a writer, a musician and a good one at that. I work for a film director, let’s say this person directed half of Twin Peaks, many films we have all seen, that kind of a film director. They’ve read my work, they validate it. Many people compliment my work and I’ve always been told I have genuine talent. I know I do, it’s the one honorable quality I have. I’ve lived through a lot, I have seen aloe, I understand many things that others my age just don’t. Humble brag. 
I know if I had been my age 30 years ago, I would be up at CBGB’s or whatever the fuck, I know my writing and shit would be well known. 
But in an age like this, where everything revolves around self publicizing via social media, where the fuck do you go when the last thing you want is to post something on Instagram? How is a writer or an artist supposed to do anything now when everything is so deeply concentrated on social media? 
How am I supposed to share my work? 
How can I tell people I’m a human?
I feel that people just don’t know how to connect anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm a caregiver part-time for a couple of young girls that aren't all there mentally. The young girl I'm with today is just a piece of work.

I kept asking her what she wants for dinner. She says corn dogs. So I heat her up some corn dogs and fries. She's been listening to music-the same ten songs over and over-Ten minutes later I remind her that dinner is on the table. She reluctantly goes to the table to ""eat"" but doesn't eat three bites before she says ""I don't like corn dogs, I like hot dogs.""  


\*sigh\* I tell her she can just take the bread off the corn dog. A hot dog and a corn dog is the same thing. She poo-poos the idea, puts her dinner in the microwave and goes back to listening to the same songs at a too loud volume (we constantly have to tell her to turn it down).
