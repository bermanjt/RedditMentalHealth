2,"My mental health has immensely downgraded and I've been 'breezing through' my winter break. I haven't felt this depressed and negative in forever. The only thing I have looked forward to and have lifted me up is the person I am currently seeing but as of recently, he has been MIA b/c he does not have his phone and there is no way for us to contact each other. I'm not sure when he will get it back.

I feel so sad. It's going to be an entire new year in just a few days, and I worry that i'll have a bad year next year because I'm currently having a terrible month...and I don't know what to do. I feel so alone. Even my own friends have been making me feel alone. My usual outlet is going out and having fun, but lately going out with my friends has been making me anxious. It's just not the same.

This sucks. I had a terrible Christmas too and there is just nothing going on for me. I'm miserable.

3,"I don't enjoy TV. It just doesn't grab me - I find myself wondering why I'm looking at a fuckin box, and where did my thoughts go. People try to tell me ""there's good TV out there!!"" to little avail. I'm not a TV person, and I don't have a problem with people liking it.

Music, don't get me started. I could listen to anything from country to classical to death metal ALL DAY. It makes me think. Feel. There's no need to insist that it's an art form - nobody disagrees.

But when you're amongst TV people, they don't recognize that their precious TV is just as agonising for me as my music is for them, AND NOBODY FUCKING COMPROMISES. TV people are the fuckin worst.

Look, I get that you don't want to listen to my shit, but I don't want to watch your shit just as much, and I'm making 100% of the compromise when I say ""let's just listen to a couple songs"". My couple of songs is ~10 minutes, but your couple of episodes is the entire afternoon.

 The only thing that gave me a reason to live when I was a teenager was to leave the country and move to U.S. for a fresh start. And I did, two years ago. I was happy for a while.  But now I have no goal and no one to care about. 

I'm no longer interested in anything. I find new new ideas of things to do, then I lose interest before even starting.

 I don't know what I like anymore and I can't find something that makes me feel good. I started doubting college and my major. I just don't know what I want or what to do next.

6,"Today (we’ll technically yesterday) the family and I went to visit my parents for Christmas. We got to talking about jury duty as I just finished serving and both of my parents have served. The case I just did was a drug case, moms case was a domestic violence case about 6 years ago, and dads case was a sexual assault case. During this conversation I found out my dad was a victim of sexual assault.

Dad was raised in a very devout Roman Catholic family (not like the bible is law type, more of the go church and Sunday school every weekend type) they were moderately active in the church to the point that dad became the alter boy. According my dad the priest would lead the alter boys down to the church basement and into a closet beneath the stairs where he would sexually assault them. Yes dear reader my dad was sexually assaulted by a priest about 30ish years ago. The priest has since died of cancer and is probably burning in hell (at least I hope he is). 

I feel so angry and disgusted with the Catholic Church. How could they allow such disgusting men to call themselves disciples of god? My dad still gets extremely anxious when he has to go in a church and will always sit close to the door (my wedding and grandpa’s funeral are the only exceptions). the priest never faced any legal consequences because of course my dad was terrified to tell anyone because the priest told him he’d go to hell if he said anything. It makes me even angrier knowing my dads brothers were also alter boys for the same priest and were probably also victims of this sick man. 

I remember the investigations from a few years ago on priests accused of sexual assault (the priest who victimized my dad was already dead) and how much it upset me. Now knowing my dad was a victim, I have never felt this level of anger and hatred towards anything or anyone before. I no longer want anything to do with the catholic religion and am not sure I could ever step foot in a church again. 

My heart hurts so much for my dad, I can’t imagine what he went through.",27Dec2019,1
7,"I got into a huge fight with a close friend this weekend. It's tough, they were pushing me to be a better version of myself. While I was initially resistant to their suggestions I gave them serious thought, and had changed my mind on some of the suggestions. One of the things suggested was to quit smoking by the end of the year while they would quit vaping, and also that I should go seek therapy. They ended up quitting vaping roughly 2 weeks ago. I committed to being tobacco free by the end of the year, and transition to vaping. The fight started when I brought up the idea of going to the doctor in the early part of the year to get a Chantix prescription to be off nicotine completely. I am really sensitive to my smoking and the effect it can have on others, so after my friend had quit vaping, I asked them again if my smoking would be a problem for them and the answer was no. 

So the fight started with them letting me know that the smoking was becoming a problem. I thanked them for letting me know, and they kept on explaining how it was a problem for them. I said, I didn't know it was a problem, and again thanked them for letting me know and reminded them that I was quitting smoking at the end of the year and I hoped it didn't continue to be the problem. It went south from there, I got a quip how I think I don't need therapy, that a few of my behaviors are triggering to them. I tried to remain resilient through the argument, but I got to a point where I just needed to poke the bear after they said they could say some really mean shit (twice). I was expecting the words to hurt, but instead it was how they were said. I got blasted with a very blunt representation of myself (some I can agree with, others I don't), and was told to not contact them for a few days. Right after that, they told me that they thought I had Asperger's. 

It almost feels like they wanted to fight. When I wouldn't they just kept swinging at me, until I had enough and started calling them out. They've done this before. It's really frustrating. I shared how I felt a few days later to them, and they said they felt disrespected, misinterpreted, and misunderstood. Funny, I do too.

I know cigarette smoke can be disgusting to people. I know cigarette smoke around someone who is quitting nicotine can be challenging. I know what doesn't bother a person one day can bother a person the next day. I know that triggers are valid even if they take time to emerge. I know they had an ex that abused them, but that does not make abusing me ok. Telling me to not respond, calling me autistic, and when I called them out days later, I got the textbook abuser response of ""that's not what I meant"" and ""I was being disrespectful"". 

So yeah, the friendship is over at least for now. They'll need one hell of a mea cupla to come back from here. Hopefully they show their therapist the fight we had and someone can be a check on their behavior. Everyone in my circle who's read the fight (biased sample I know) has sided with me 100%. 

tl;dr: Don't fight over text. While it can be helpful to have a written record of what was said, all sense of tone gets lost.",27Dec2019,1
8,"I wish I can do so many things differently in my 17 year old life. God it’s all such bullshit nowadays. Especially the whole college system. You’re doomed to be within an endless debt unless you earn a scholarship or come from privilege. It’s infuriating. My demographic gets fucking blindsided in this stupid ass country. So now here I am about to depart for college knowing full well I’m gonna end up in a debt that I’ll never get out of rotting away in some god forsaken cubicle. A lot of people complain about my generation of young men. “Oh these worthless fucks only play video games and jerk off, if they were my son I would kill them!!” Well would you like to be whole heartedly welcomed to a lifetime of debt, a social structure that paints you as a rapist from birth, and an overall relatively boring and miserable ass life? Didn’t think so. So it’s either we let ourselves drown in that or face two options. The military or the vices like video games, anime, etc. The military gives an outlet of violence and physical improvement only downside is our self worse becomes less than that of a citizen with an additional effect of mental issues and a country that doesn’t give two shits about veterans. Anime, video games and all of that gives us an outlet of fantasy giving us a setting in which we can imagine and input ourselves into exciting and heroic lives. Ofcourse it’s all fake but one thing a young man tends to fear most (or at least what I fear most) is rejection. The fear of failure, the fear of meaning nothing. It’s why a lot of young men struggle with women. I’ve pulled some girls but nothing crazy sure I go to the gym but for the most part I’m a bland personality and everyone hates that. Thus the reason why so many of these young guys like myself are shut ins. We are a fatherless generation with no purpose. No wars to fight. No enemy to protect the world against. Nothing. we have no purpose. And in the attempt to find that purpose else where we end up being demonized as assholes or slow kids who do nothing for society. well there might be those who actually take the time to read this drivel and say “hey I’m a young man, and I’m not a loser or a shut in or a nihilistic cunt like you!!! I have a great life!!” Congratulations, just recognize not all are given the same privilege or same happiness as you.

16," There are quite a number of issues I'd like to also adress here, but we'll get to that.

&amp;#x200B;

 About 4 months ago, I started to go to the gym, and for me it was a real motivation to do so, because I've always had a hard time at making it past 165 pounds (or 75 kilograms). And for a while, it went smooth, I started to study translation after a seriously hard period, in which I dropped out of law-school and battled with depression, eating disorders and attempts of suicide for about 3-7 months, until I finally started getting better because of my friends and my psichologist.

 Fast forward 2 and a half months and my mom started slowly hinting at the fact that I was eating too much for her liking: I stared hearing comments such as ""you're exaggerating with that gymn thing"", ""you're getting too big"", ""I have spent x, y and z much money on food this month"" and my personal favorite ""you can't eat that, it will unbalance my economies"".

 Here's the thing though: I have a weekend part-time, which allows me to buy my own things and help with the bills at home. I earn about 425 euros (472 dollars/ 363 sterling pounds).  
 Out of that I give my mom each months 80 euros (88 dollars/ 68 sterling pounds), pay 87 euros for my college (96 dollars/ 74 sterling pounds), 120 euros for my therapist (133 dollars/ 102 sterling pounds), 30 euros for my monthly transportation ticket (33 dollars/ 28 sterling pounds) 20-30 euros for my phone service (22-33 dollars/ 17-25 sterling pounds); the rest, I either keep for myself, use it for my lunch money plus other stuff of, if it spares (which it never does), I put in my scarce savings account.  
 My therapist has been so touched to know this, that she has offered to give her fee up and give me free consultation, that angel of a human being.

 I am not a spoiled brat, since I am 18, I have worked my ass off to get wherever I've got to, I have avoided and avoided to ask for a even a penny to my mother, and I have made ends meet to that I can be as independent as it gets. I am trying to make it on my own, but in the end, even though I pretty much pay to live in my home, even though my mother has changed jobs, got a raise, and even though she now makes about as much as 25% more money as she did before: ""THERE ISN'T ENOUGH MONEY FOR ALL THE YOU WANT"". 

 That's right, she told me this.

 On top of that I tried to talk to her, maybe into finding a suitable solution for us both, so that we could maybe make ends meet, and it ended in her saying this: ""you either keep paying your monthly fee and put an extra to buying YOUR food or you leave this house"".  
 So I went to the supermarket, and I bought two huge grocery bags worth of past, sausages, brocolli, cereal, eggs and other things necessary to a high calory, and still, healthy diet (and men shaving cream, but let's not go there).  
 Dumb of me to think, this would solve my problem, when I got home with the food, she greeted my by saying that I had not understood her message, and that there was not enough space for my food, as well as throwing a hissy fit, by criticizing my shopping options, telling my I needed to learn how to save money. On top of that, the money I spent on food was what I had to pay for my college, so I had to delay that to eat.  
 Nothing changed: I cook my own food and everytime I am cooking she checks on it, just to see it isn't ""hers"". This is ""our house"", but is isn't even a home.

 I am utterly, completely, definitely tired of my mother: I am tired of years of narcisistic needyness, that led her to beat me up after or while she kept me awake to ""update my school notes"" when I was 12, as an argument to have validity to do so- she did it because I'd rather spend time with my friends of the time, instead of her passive agressive ass; I am tired of remembering that she tried and threatened to kill herself in front of me when I was the same age, just to force me to call her boyfriend back into her life; I am tired of remembering, she attacked and insulted every person I have loved that wasn't her just to force me to love her sociopathic ass, and I am definitely tired of all these 21 years that have grown me into a heartfelt, loner of a man, who would rather be alone than trust somebody enough to love them and I am tired that every time I push someone away to have some peace, she thinks that's her valitidity to try and assault my pain to collect her undeserving love.

 I am tired of the fact that my mental health, my stomach, my phisical health, my college, my daily energy and proper nutrition are worth less than the money in a fucking wallet. I am tired of the fact that my health has been bouncing dangerously between excellent and threatening for about 3 years now, because my mother can't set her priotities straight and tell the difference between love and violence, care and consumption.

 My dream of a life now is being in a place where I can be completely alone and devoid of people wreacking havoc with their expectations over me, so that they can show me off to their friends or relatives, completely disregarding what I expect from myself in the first place, somewhere I won't have to choose between love and my identity, somewhere where love won't be a ""lesser evil"" and I can focus on myself and be alone.  
 In this Christmas, that is I desired for from all my heart: when you have a home where you can't eat in peace, you learn to value those little things. I am tired of her and I just know: when I'm done with college, and don't have it's expenses, I'm outta here, and when I am, there will be no phone calls, no texts and e-mails to or from my mother: I will live my own life; I am a handsome young man, when I am healthy and even though I have done my fair share of hurting others, I have always learned to come back on top and value those who did me good, and to recognize my actions. That is more than she ever did with me.

 If you read this, thank you, and I am keen to know your opinion on this topic.

My grandfather, who is my mentor due to my father dying when I was still in single digits, always said that a satisfied mind is sad. Meaning that you should never stop learning and you should strive for more. I like that philosophy.

So, a decent gig became open at a state public broadcasting organization in another state. While I like teaching, the position is a chance to get back into the hustle and not have to deal with university politics, grades, grading, etc. etc.

Here is where the fuck-up starts - I didn’t see my resume in my Google Docs page, so I just whipped up another one to send in for the position. Hit the high points, recent awards, education - nothing big. I sent a link to the resume with a straightforward “cover letter” to the proper email address, from a ridiculous “spoof” address I use to sign up for things - hence why I couldn’t find my current resume.

I have a good gig, so this isn’t a lose situation, but how bad do you believe I fucked this up? If I re-send the proper resume from my personal address and just hope the spam filter stopped my previous email, is there a possibility that the director won’t notice?

45,"It's very easy for a person to make various claims on here on reddit. I claimed that I was doing some amateur paper trading (simulated stock market analysis/research and investing).  The stock ticker that I was monitoring (one of a handful) was 'EYEG'. This was back when it was well below a dollar a share. I did some research and liked what that were up to and so I added it to my list.  It's now approaching $9 a share. 

Jerry would usually invest everything (about $6,000) on a single stock. Now stop what you're doing and calculate that. Even if had invested only a $1,000, the return would have been incredible. What did he do instead? He followed the advice of the hustlers here on reddit and they had the guy believing that California Edison was going to be shutdown and liquidated. He invested based on his belief and lost his ass. Edison has been through all kinds of shit over the years and has yet to be liquidated. That wouldn't happen anyway. It would be a merge or a buyout but never liquidation.

A $1,000 worth of 'EYEG' shares would've returned about $30,000. Had he thrown it all at this stock, the return would've been nearly $200,000. No, it wouldn't have happened within the realm of day trading but you know what? That's not always the best path to take. 

Did I get lucky? How about those electric school buses in Los Angeles County? I was on top of that as well. My last 'toy stock' was 'FCEL'. Was like 20 cents a share or something. Same thing with 'PULM' and a few others. 

But let's move on to another topic. 

Over the years Epic Games has provided a public forum on which to discuss their various video games. They've done this since like 1997 or so and each time they've had to close the forum down which removed all the posts. Too much bullshit. 

Some time ago, before Unreal Engine 3, I posted that Epic Games should allow licensees to reduce their royalty costs by submitting features to the engine deemed reusable and worthwhile. I was quickly attacked by an employee of Epic Games in what can be best described as a hostile encounter. Now Epic Games was sued by a company called Too Human. The claim was that Epic promised they would implement various features in the source code that was made available to licensees. Instead, per the claim, Epic was implementing advanced features in their private copy used for video games developed by Epic Games and would not implement those features in the licensee revision. 

Now my idea was not unusual. When Legend licensed the Unreal Engine for Wheel of Time, they added features to the engine that Epic merged into the mainline copy that they used themselves. Yet, for some reason, this caused an Epic employee to lash out at me with an attack that was best described as hostile. 

Had a third party implemented this feature, and had their royalty payments reduced, Epic would not have had to take part in this trial. Epic won, but only after Tim Sweeney had to make an appearance and testify. Too Human claimed that this undelivered feature promised by Epic caused their game to fail in the market place. So the question is whether the reduced royalty payment would've been worth the time and effort. Yes, it would have because even though Epic won the case, they still lost money. This was before Tim Sweeney stepped down as the head programmer. 

Now, some of you have purchased Epic Games titles from Good Old Games (GOG). You probably noticed that they got the Visual Basic editor running for Unreal Gold. Back in 2013, I developed a new editor that was about 80% complete and it took me two months. It was based on a review of various documents and reverse engineering and written using the Qt toolkit. I bitched about this situation (loudly) all the way back in 1999 and 2000. Yes, they do rewrite the Unreal Editor in C++, but that version only works for Unreal Tournament. Not Deus Ex, Wheel of Time, Rune, Klingon Honor Guard, the Nerf game, or any of those older titles. My editor works with all of them and it only took more than 10 fucking years of waiting to make it happen. So where is it?

Go ask 'LEOCTK' on [Beta Archive](https://www.betaarchive.com). I gave him all my design notes and the complete source code of everything. I sat back one day and realized that people take and take and are not even grateful at any time. I said to hell with it and got rid of it.  Shared the archive with this guy and deleted everything. 

Same goes with the Qt framework I wrote for Lightwave 3D. You could actually whip up plug-ins really fucking quick with this framework. I even had the QtScript shit working with the panels functionality. It was extremely fucking cool. These days, Lightwave 3D was actually ported to the Qt framework. Talk about having vision. My framework was in work about 2012-2013 or so. I knew Qt was going to become the industry standard and I was right.

Why am I telling you people this? Because many of you are interested in what I have to offer but you want to proceed under the cover of smoke, mirrors, and cold war spy bullshit fuckery. Tracy wants to fuck and have two kids but she wants to send fucking smoke signals and encoded messages for some reason. Diane also wants to fuck and have more kids but is terrified of being laughed at. Laura is apparently a dirty old woman now and ready for more action. Sara, the various Jessica's, and even Erin. Holy shit. 

I'm didn't go homeless because of laziness, nonperformance, and an inability to succeed. I became homeless because I was fucking betrayed when I least expected it, by those I would have never expected to do such a thing. They then took ownership of my work laptop and presumably overwrote all my notes. What I have now is only remnants of what used to exist. Mostly complete believe it not (Thank God Almighty for this).

Now, back when I was weightlifting it was much of the same thing and I remember it very clearly. Not just any weightlifting, my next squat goal (full Olympic squat) was 600 pounds.  I had already hit a 550 pound dead lift. These numbers aren't that impressive to be honest. It's how fast I got there that was amazing. I literally trained several days a week and never injured myself believe it or not. The childish behavior at the gym got so fucking bad, that they would blast the air conditioner all the time. It was about 50 degrees in a fucking gym. I had apparently hurt the egos of their expert trainers because my training protocol mocked their non-existent knowledge of anything but running their fucking mouth.

So this is not an act of charisma. I'm not trying to sell anyone life insurance or walk away with a person's life savings. I don't need to use your back as a stepping stone to success as I've already paved my own road with blood, sweat, Mountain Dew, and coffee.

What I need here, and this is a prerequisite for anything and everything, is for people to boldly stand up and say ""No! I'm Spartacus!"". Meaning, that you'll have courage and stand the fuck up and speak out about what you want. Because I'm absolutely not doing this James Bond super secret signal bullshit with people. I'm not. 

I'm not going to fuck around with a bunch of chickenshit people on the Web about various software development projects. I'm not going to tolerate your sorry as demeanor and listen to a running fucking mouth with hands that produce absolutely no written code. Where is the Alien vs. Predator 2 project? It's fucking gone kiddos. Where is this fabled Thief The Dark Project engine project? Go fuck yourself. That's where it's at.

Are you receiving the fucking signal? Is your radar picking up my blip? I strive to keep promises, meet deadlines, and come through for people. That people consider me some kind of chance or risk is the biggest motherfucking insult to my entire life. I don't need the bullshit and my life doesn't require it.

I’ve (22F) never been in a relationship before and I’ve been reflecting on my life trying to figure out why and I think one reason is because I might be a slut. To be clear I’ve never slept with anyone’s partner or broken up a relationship so I don’t mean “slut” in that traditional sense. I’ve hooked up with guys and been on 2-3 dates but that’s all. My mom said it’s cause I sleep with guys too soon and guys don’t respect or date “those type of girls” usually. She’s probably right but I never really considered that I was acting like a slut just having fun with guys that seemed nice. One of my old therapists asked me a while back if I slept with guys so soon because I think that that’s all I have to offer to guys and I originally shrugged it off but now I’m not so sure.

Also, no I don't think you should have sex with minors. Although 16 or younger is the legal age in most US states and all of Europe except Cyprus, and Ireland where it is 17. Most European countries even have the age of consent as 14 which in my opinion is way too low.

TLDR - I am a man in my late 20’s who has been in a few committed serious relationships. I find myself wanting to be more of a f***boy even as I see my friends get married. Sometimes I find travel/hookups meaningless, but I still chase it. IMO long term joy = real meaningful love and building a life. What do you make of this?

Reddit,

Help me gain your understanding and perspective on this. 

I’m a late mid twenties male who has stable career with advancement, had a few serious relationships, and been lucky enough to have the opportunity to live abroad a few times. At this stage in my life, I understand where joy comes from - a happy family, a few friends and a partner who actually love you, meaningful shared experiences, learning, self growth, exercise, good food, sun. As I’m approaching 30 I can’t help shake the feeling that I ought to be using these lessons and building a “real” life for myself. But instead I find myself yearning for more travel, adventure, and more sexual exploration - even though sometimes when I am traveling or meeting up for sex I am thinking “what’s the point of this.” I know this stuff is “foolish” in the sense that it doesn’t lead to “true joy,” but I can’t help but have these desires. And I think it’s important to pursue them - maybe not too much but at least to some extent. 

What do you think? Is this something I need to see through? Is it meaningful/meaningless? Am I delusional and missing something completely? I guess ultimately this is my ask - I know the things that bring joy are things you build and last, but my desire to go deeper into the “prodigal son/meaningless exploration” path for now is still strong - what’s your take on this?",27Dec2019,1

63,"Did your middle/secondary school or your high school ever have rules against having your backpack during lunch? The way it “works” is 3rd period ends, and you have to put your backpack in your 5th period class before you can go to lunch, which is 4th period. Just why I’m asking is because we literally get our backpacks confiscated to the office if a particularly stingy teacher notices it. Most teachers/aids dont care, a few would be like “put it in your next period class next time....”. But still, I got my backpack confiscated. I’m a part of one of the “arts” cliques. We show each other our artworks, tell them how it works, gawk at how great/bad somebody’s art is. So we are regularly needing stuff that is in our backpacks. Markers, paper, our art itself, we always need somthing in our backpack. In case your saying, “It’s so you don’t have anything inappropriate on you during lunch”, they really do not care what is in your pocket, unless it is a phone. Not a phone, you good. I have markers hanging from my pocket/shirt all the time, along with plenty of other things have been in my pockets/HANDS during that quick pocket glance they do to check for a phone. Even the stingy ones, they don’t care. In case you’re wondering why we don’t just take a second to grab everything we need, for one, we can’t predict that, for two, it may be too much/too fragile for pockets and hands. And third, we have a very small passing period, so everybody is RUNNING to class, not socializing. This means lunch is the only time we can socialize, we don’t wanna waste that time!

65,"Ok so I don’t know if other people have this problem but I have a tendency when having a conversation with someone to interrupt them quite often. See, I myself have ADHD A chronic condition including attention difficulty, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness. Which for me means that while talking to someone I’m listening to what they’re saying but if more than one point is being made in one sentence I need to quickly intervene to express my concern, opinion, or answer to one point at a time. The reason for this being that if I do not get in what i am thinking right at that moment then a few things happen. 1. I wait until you’re done talking I only have a response for 1 thing you said maybe the first or second thing and I completely disregard the rest of everything else that came out of your mouth because I was thinking of my response to the one thing and that is the only thing I could do so it was impossible for me to hear anything else you said. That is what happens when i try to be polite and not interrupt. Which leaves us with a bland conversation where nothing really at all get accomplished. Or number 2. You say something I but in and respond to the 1 thing being said you make another point I respond to that one and so on and so forth. Now that is how I personally have a conversation. For me there is literally no other way because as I said before my ADHD prevents me from being able to focus on so many things at once. Even tho to most people having a chat is really only one thing, but to me it is many. Some people get really upset about this because they say I’m not listening, this couldn’t be any farther from the truth tho! If I am responding to you throughout the whole conversation that means I am listening. What you’re saying is registering in my brain and I am holding that information in while at the same time telling you what I think about what we’re talking about, and what you just said. If I sit there and am quite the whole entire time you’re talking then I didn’t hear a single word you just said. I might respond with a yes or a uh huh or a ok you’re right. But without being given the opportunity to speak my mind on the situation I just sit there frustrated and unable to focus at all. Everyone does things different and I realize that the way I am could be very frustrating to people who don’t converse the way that I do. Hopefully this was helpful to some people. Maybe someone else out there feels the same way I do and then there are probably a lot who have no idea what the heck I’m talking about. I’m honestly learning about myself every single day and I’m interested in knowing and learning about others too. So I have a few questions 1. Does anyone understand this? Is this normal? Do other people do this too? Am I just a weirdo? 2. How do other people have conversations? What’s the best way to keep yourself fully involved in a conversation? What loses your attention? Or grabs it? 3. What are some of your “having a chat” pet peeves? 
My biggest pet peeve would be when I’m trying to talk to someone and while agreeing with them or just generally responding to them while they’re talking, they stop talking look at me angered by this and tell me to stop talking and to just listen. Because then I’m not hearing a word that comes out!",27Dec2019,1

That is what happens when i try to be polite and not interrupt. Which leaves us with a bland conversation where nothing really at all get accomplished. Or number 2. You say something I but in and respond to the 1 thing being said you make another point I respond to that one and so on and so forth. Now that is how I personally have a conversation. For me there is literally no other way because as I said before my ADHD prevents me from being able to focus on so many things at once. Even tho to most people having a chat is really only one thing, but to me it is many. Some people get really upset about this because they say I’m not listening, this couldn’t be any farther from the truth tho! If I am responding to you throughout the whole conversation that means I am listening. What you’re saying is registering in my brain and I am holding that information in while at the same time telling you what I think about what we’re talking about, and what you just said. If I sit there and am quite the whole entire time you’re talking then I didn’t hear a single word you just said. I might respond with a yes or a uh huh or a ok you’re right. But without being given the opportunity to speak my mind on the situation I just sit there frustrated and unable to focus at all. Everyone does things different and I realize that the way I am could be very frustrating to people who don’t converse the way that I do. Hopefully this was helpful to some people. Maybe someone else out there feels the same way I do and then there are probably a lot who have no idea what the heck I’m talking about. I’m honestly learning about myself every single day and I’m interested in knowing and learning about others too. So I have a few questions 1. Does anyone understand this? Is this normal? Do other people do this too? Am I just a weirdo? 2. How do other people have conversations? What’s the best way to keep yourself fully involved in a conversation? What loses your attention? Or grabs it? 3. What are some of your “having a chat” pet peeves? 
My biggest pet peeve would be when I’m trying to talk to someone and while agreeing with them or just generally responding to them while they’re talking, they stop talking look at me angered by this and tell me to stop talking and to just listen. Because then I’m not hearing a word that comes out!",27Dec2019,1

68," I remember the day during my sister’s wedding and my grandpa told me this: *“Kailan ka mag-aasawa?” (“When you will get married?”).* I didn’t answer anything or should I say: *“No one likes me…”* or *“Because I am so shy to court a girl.”*

Being single is a choice and not a destiny. But some of the people said that it is their destiny as single because no one likes them but they refused to court someone.

69,"I feel so incredibly overwhelmed by life right now. Everyone I've ever met doesn't seem to have any trouble handling 8+ hour work days but here I am skipping so many days because I can't physically bring myself to go in anymore. It feels like a wave of anxiety and stress just crashes into me and everything becomes impossible to handle. So I lay on my floor and I don't go at all, drowning in guilt because I know for certain my coworkers see me as incompetent and irresponsible for abandoning my duties. 

I don't know what's wrong with me, I just know something is. 

I am well aware that this is ""The Real World"" and I know many people feel stressed and exhausted, sometimes even depressed or hate their job with a passion but keep pressing on despite. These facts don't boost any sense of responsibility or morale for me. They make me feel like a child in an adult world. Unable to function the way an adult should and do the things an adult should do despite trying so so so hard I constantly feel like I'm on the verge of just breaking entirely. Everyone is depressed and stressed but still trucking on through their challenges, so I must certainly be an incredibly incompetent and incapable person to have such little resilience.

She told me that for Christmas she would get me some stuff for my house, which I was looking forward to. I got her everything that she asked for, even though so of it was really hard to find, as well as a really nice pair of trainers that were not cheap. 

In return, she got me a pair of gloves, which don’t fit me, and a make up bag from her favourite shop. I don’t and have never worn make up in my life by the way. I’m just a bit shocked that that is what she thought I would need or want in my life right now.

78,"So I have been in this relationship for 1 yr and 7 months approximately. I must say I fell madly in love with my SO very much at the beginning. When we met we had such beautiful moments, but then stuff started to happen. If you have replied to me in r/relationship_advice I’m really sorry I didn’t listen to your words, even though I knew they were true. He did “little” things like lie to me on my face until I found out the truth via other people; nothing serious but still. Then every time something bothered me and I mentioned it to him, sometimes in the best of ways, sometimes in a more passive aggressive way (not OK, I know, I’m going to therapy to treat my depression), but EVERY time he blows up and tells me I’m being controlling and that he’s sick of it and that he’s better off without me. Then he doesn’t talk to me for a while and then he comes back and tells me I need to get treatment because of my insecurities. My “controlling” behaviour was saying I found it strange that him likes on Instagram pics of ex classmates/colleagues pics in bikinis or underwear in their room. There’s also a pic of a naked friend of his in that sack. I didn’t even make a scene, although I was kind of passive aggressive saying it. He totally lashed out on me and told me he will have to close Instagram and for me to stop pestering him and that he didn’t want to talk to me. I saw those pics by mere chance and wasn’t looking for something in particular. But well. That’s it. This time I’m not following through. This has been to date my most important relationship, but I’m done being treated this way. 
What scares me the most is that we were renting an apartment together since next week and I signed the contract because my job situation is a lot better; although I still can’t pay for that apartment on my own, so I really don’t know what I’ll do.

Is just getting ready for his awesome party and insisting that I reiterate to him in detail what i said last night so that he can tell his mom, against my wishes and telling me that I need to stop drinking. Like we all haven't been drinking over the holidays. I actually drank less than him yesterday. Wish he'd just ask me how I'm feeling to be honest. Hasn't happened so far today. But now I'm in a panic cos hes going out and I'm just gonna be here hiding in the room, searching for an apartment most likely.

80,"I always knew I did not want children. From a very young age, I always knew. I have no lack of thoroughly thought through reasons for my decision: wanting a career, wanting to travel, wanting to focus on myself, having had quite a terrible childhood myself and feeling like childhood for me was just persevering to adulthood so life could begin, not being particularly fond of children, being very independent, not wanting to sacrifice myself, etc. I was always very proud of being responsible enough to think this through at an early age so that I knew my own position, not being pressured into having children I would later regret or not take care of properly, and for always being very careful with protecting myself against pregnancy in all relationships I had. This was my choice, my body, my life, and I felt responsible, in control and very happy about my decision. Always.

I met my husband 1.5 years ago. I was 28. He was 49. Growing up with a single mother and a grandmother and no male role model whatsoever I always had quite severe father issues. I was also always very aware, and while my friends in our early 20’s could meet boys who treated them horribly, I almost always dated really nice men who treated me really lovely. They were just always much older. I have never been able to feel attracted to someone my own age. I quite wish I could, it would have made many things simpler, but the preference for older men is just rooted deep in my sexuality. It’s there, it’s me, it’s fine really.

I met my first boyfriend at 18, he was 30. At 20 I was with a 35 year old. At 26 I was with a man who was 52, and shortly after that relationship ended, I met my husband; I was 28 and he was 49. He is perfect in _every_ aspect except one huge one: he has two children, two teenagers, from a previous marriage. I spent _years_ avoiding to date men with children. I was single a long time because of it. When I met my husband I spent the first five months dramatically pending between wanting to spend my life with him and deciding to brake it off immediately, because _two children_.

I have always been very clear about what I want, never any problems knowing my own feelings and opinions. Until entering this relationship. A huge part of the reasoning behind our entire wedding was trying to put the whole issue of me trying to come to terms with him having children behind us, which I realize might not be the best reason to get married, but that’s what we did.

i hate the fact that he has two kids. I hate it. I hate there entire existence. Don’t get me wrong, I am very nice to them and I make an effort. I _do_ realize they are not to blame for my feelings or their father’s decision to marry me despite those feelings (that he of course knows all about). But I do hate that I have to share him with them, I hate the unfairness of the fact that I can offer him 1 place in my world but I have to share my 1 place with his two kids. I hate that they get in the way of plans we want to make. I hate that I have to live with someone else’s children. I just hate every aspect of it.

All of this I guess I could somehow learn to deal with eventually. But I hate a much more fundamental part of it: what it does to my identity. Never before have I felt that my choice to not have children has made me _lack_ anything or made my life _lesser_ in any way. Never until I met my husband and started imagining a life with him. It’s not that I’m suddenly experiencing a change of mind or a longing for children, it’s what the fact that he has them does to my identity as child free.

I can’t quite explain it. It’s like I’m suddenly confronted with having to, reluctantly, be part of someone else’s family where children are included. Having to listen to his feelings and thoughts about his children, being part of their life, having to even consider someone else’s children at all. My life was completely free from all aspects of children before him: non of my friends have them or want them, I have no siblings or family members with kids, etc. I felt that a life free from all associations with children made my life _ritcher_. Now, I feel like I have to live with a lot of what I never wanted, but for someone else’s children. I suddenly feel like my life is lacking. Not because I want children, but because I have to live next to someone who did, and I can’t ignore it or wake up every day blessing my complete freedom and independence.

I feel truly lost because of this. I find myself obsessing over articles about women who regret having children and women who mourn not having children, no longer knowing who I really identify more with, which is a terrifying feeling for me; my choice to be child free has always been a huge part of my identity for me. Now I feel less like an independent and strong woman, and more like an inadequate one. I have also started to detect bitterness within myself, and I don’t like it. I never used to dislike children. I wasn’t particularly interested in them, but they never bothered me in small doses now and again. Since meeting my husband I find myself feeling genuinely angry every time I see a child. It is not a flattering new side of me. Bitterness and resentment rarely suits anyone.

This is the first time in my life I’ve felt lost, confused, disoriented and truly ambivalent about _what I really want_. I can’t seem to shake it.

I love my husband. Truly. He is kind, loving, generous, a gentleman, attentive, intelligent, funny, just perfect in every way. I tried to tell him how I feel but he doesn’t understand; in his mind it is very black &amp; white. One either wants children or one doesn’t. He can’t understand how I can actively choose not to, and still feel sad about that decision, and he doesn’t understand how his having children could affect my feelings about not having them. I suppose his response is quite legitimate; in a perfectly logical world I would not feel like this.

Favorites: 

1. Spending time with family ( yes,  family is not perfect but it's family).
2. Eating all the holiday food with family. My stomach hurt on Christmas afternoon because I ate too much. While unhealthy, I like how it's socially acceptable for everyone to eat lots of food during the holidays :)  
3. Celebrating/ Dancing to welcome the New Year with family. 

Dislike: 

1. Consumerism - the family stresses out about getting each other gifts.
2. Holiday shopping/malls - Way too many people and chaos everywhere.
3. The media painting a  picture-perfect Christmas most people don't have.

88,"Fuck.  I can best describe the relationship as volatile. We had highs and we had lows, but we put in considerable effort to improve our communication and how we argue.  Then in the final fight, she ignores everything and refuses to communicate with me.  I'm talking about my feelings and she's defensive and giving me attitude.

Like every other fight, it's never her fault.  It's about my tone and my reaction to her fighting dirty.  We once fought because I disagreed with her.  She thought my tone was dismissive.  I don't think it was, but we were cooking together and I was just talking with her.  Here's the twist, we were talking about a gift for my mom and I disagreed saying my mom wouldn't like the gift my gf mentioned.  Sure, call it dismissive, but it's my mom we're talking about.

Again, nothing was her fault.  I didn't care, I didn't put enough effort in, I didn't listen.  We spent a ton of money and time on couples counseling where the therapist even told her that she's 1) starting bullshit fights and 2) needs to stop being dependent on me for her emotional support.  This helped her realize that she needed to hide her feelings better.  

I admit though, one of her complaints was that once we moved in together, we stopped dating and going out.  I did fuck that up. I felt smothered by her and her constant need for attention.  She once went on a work trip to another city.  After work, bored, she called me 3 times in 4 hours while texting in between.  Sure I brought up the issue, but she said she wasn't being needy and that I could have been more direct in saying that I needed my own time.  I couldn't, possibly wouldn't, understand her needs in this regard and obviously couldn't communicate alternatives.

And towards the end, she found a guy and he's giving her all the attention she needs.  She did the minimal amount required not to cheat, going so far as to suggest an open relationship.  And I'm ashamed to say, I fell for it.  We had always been kinky, so an open relationship seemed like something we could handle.  Except once she had the green light, she went distant and cold.  She was already checked out.

The final fight was over me feeling abandoned in favor of the secondary relationship.  She said that my request for more affection was the same as her request for more affection when she was calling me 3 times in 4 hours.  There was no way the open relationship was playing role.  If I was feeling like she was feeling, it was the same situation.  If I was allowed to deny her feelings and needs, she was allowed to deny my feelings now.  

I once told her, her feelings aren't my responsibility.  When she would come home mad at the world, inevitably, she'd be mad at me too soon enough.  Her feelings aren't my responsibility.  It makes sense that she needs to own her own feelings and not look to me to solve them!  I even read this online in couples counseling articles.  Now, I'm feeling abandoned by my gf and she tells me, my feelings aren't her responsibility.  

Obviously, this was a toxic relationship.  I'd even say she's a toxic person, but I played my part too.  Our fights would escalate and we would both say terrible things to each other.  She'd escalate the fight and I'd react.  It wasn't great.

So now that we're broken up, what possible lessons can I take from this?  All this time and all this effort, how do I grow from this?  Am I a toxic person? Did I minimize her feelings and legitimize my own?  Did I ignore her? Do I write her off as a narcissist and just look at the last 2 years as a waste of time?  Am I a narcissist?  Were we just two, incompatible people forcing a relationship?  I don't know.

I am hopeful for the future though.  I had entertained the idea of breaking up before and now that it happened, it feels like I can try and find a healthy relationship.  To a degree, I also love the freedom of being single.  While hopeful, I am scared of being alone.  We planned on moving cities, on getting new jobs, and my entire life plan is now whatever I decide.

100,"Why don't I make decisions for myself. That was the inquiry, wasn't it? 

Let's do a more honest and realistic appraisal (in the form of a question). Why do I need any of you in my life? You sit there and reduce my humane kindness to a form of dysfunctional dependency. What is your value in my life? It's zero.

I desired knowledge in the way of computer programming, so I taught myself. I desired knowledge of elite weightlifting performance so I read and researched everything that I could. After that, I did the same for endurance running and swimming. I taught myself how to steer through the military law legal system and corrected my own military discharge and then handled an appeal when it was rejected. After all that, I handled the next process of getting my G.I. Bill.

Religious history was next and I learned plenty with that too. Trucking school isn't a requirement. I can get the CDL by renting out trucks and paying for advisers or personal instructors. All I need to do is pass the skills test and purchase a used truck. It's no more difficult than anything else that I've done over the years. No less or more of a headache than any other situation I've been in. 

Any person with authentic wealth (rather then paper wealth) would advise me to avoid getting married or having kids. They would advise me to skip all this bullshit entirely. This outreach and effort to reestablish familiarity and normalcy. My family life is over. I cannot trust any of those people in my immediate family any longer. Walk into a court room and lie about me? They'd do the same after finding out that I became wealthy. Would stop at nothing to destroy everything I had created for myself. It's about putting tactical education into play and lawyering the fuck up.

No, God has given me the treasure I asked for. Knowledge, awareness, and tactical insight. I find the truth long after it's been discarded. That I advise people and give assistance is kindness. It's not a dysfunction or malpractice. 

Getting married and having kids is not required by any original religious law. It's become a requirement by various cultures that have endured war and invasion. God never required anyone to get married and have kids. It's always been an option for those who cannot manage their attraction and become subject to the risk of lust. I'm completely legal right now from a religious point of view. Your vagina is not even useful to me as a desktop paperweight. 

So there it is and here we are. One of us has endured an unbelievable amount of bullshit and typically surrounded by those who cannot and will not. I can and will and this is why my words have weight and value. 

You are exactly right. Look after Numero Uno which is the strategy that's done nothing but lead me to victory every single time.

Take care.",27Dec2019,1

I've recently lost my best friend.   
And with best friend I mean someone I believed was my soulmate.   
The love of my life.   


I've  like to say that it started with me feeling sorry for someone who got  booted, someone who got shat on. Someone who was not angry but hurt.   
We  started to talk, we started to chat, we started to enjoy each others  company. we started to flirt and .... (Before i go on, i need to tell a  side story, about the time we met)..   


It was in a the 4th. of a month - i don't really know what month, but i wrote it down that it was the 4th -.  
It  was almost summer, and at the time I've just been back-stabbed by some  ""friend"" who i thought i could depend upon when things got tough.  
My  friend that was more like a buddy, because we both knew that he was  gonna screw me over if some of his newer buddies was telling him to.  
A classic scenario of ""Whatever gives me more affection of the people i  truly look up to, i shall do, no matter how devastating it must be on  others"" - that kind of guy.  


I was helping that ""friend"" who wasn't much of a friend, setting up a board-game night once again, and then I meet her.   
""A beautiful soul"", i figure after just listening to her talk to someone else.  
I  was working the bar if anybody wanted a soda or something like that, so  i wasn't participation in the games. I loved listening to her, her  voice was like a song in a musical about how someone with the purest  heart was just born.  


back to the story, the night i saw her, i  felt the presence of something that reminded me of love, and here the  story takes a leap.  
We talked a bunch the weeks after the night and i  start to flirt a bit but stopped when i realized that you weren't for  the taking.   
You had a boyfriend.   


Back to the Original story.  
....  as we made it to January after me texting weirdly, and awkward over the  night of the new years eve, she were there to talk to after i had been  so wasted.  


Following up that month my new boss was getting on my  nerves, my colleges had it the same way, everything was like a classic  story of love.  
The 14th February i sent her flowers to her workplace.  
She texted me that she wanted me there when she was falling asleep.  
I came to visit her at the school she were at, at her house and we went out to experience the world together.   


But something happened when we became summer again. we had been together a couple of months and i jumped the gun.  


When i got back from summer vacation, I'd bought a ring....  


A stupid gesture to show that her i believed that she was like a soulmate to me...  
But she loved it, ""i got on my knees, and she said yes"" i was thinking, not sure what I'd expected...  


Here is what was wrong:  
After that i got obsessive about me and her , i wanted to do everything together, i just couldn't get enough of us.  


It was a time where my boss was yelling at me, my co-workers was pushing me away and i basically had no one else..  
I told her this, which made her take her distance..  
and  she was right to do so, I'd not been the best version of myself,  dealing with stress, loneliness, depression and the ""feeling of not  being wanted"" does that to a person.  


But isn't exile a little over the top for someone you love?  


i  felt like i was living in exile when i haven't been at work for a month  and the ""not being able to connect with her"", both because i was so far  down that i couldn't even sit up in my bed, and because i constantly  tried to get her to talk to me.  


She, herself, was dealing with  something far worse than me, and didn't tell me everything about it,  only in small portions at a time. She has her stuff and i wanted to  help, but wasn't able to. I could hardly listen without crying.  


This was a down time for us both.  


All  in all the next couple of months until December was painful for us  both. She wanted to make time to do all the stuff she putted aside  because me and her was having so much to do all the time.  
I wanted to spend time together to get away from my everyday stuff which was bringing me down.  


""The more you try to pull me in, the more i will run away"" she said.  


and at the end, she was true to her word.  


That is were the story normally end when you talk about a breakup.  


But  i recently got a response for one of my millions of texts. She said  that ""now isn't the time for us to get back together. I just can't be in  a relationship right now"".... but what does that even mean?  
Does she want to get back together?  
Or was is a text so that i hopefully understood that she didn't want me anymore.  


Today:  
I've just asked about a new years eves day meetup with her.  
I wasn't able to make any plans with her.  
""I'd rather not"" was what was replied to my invitation.  
I have no idea what to expect, or what to do.  
I know that our relationship was rough on us both and the sides we took was reasonable.  


I've moved my self a bit towards ""the good life"" since i last saw her.  
I  believe I'm over all the obsession, but how can i show her that i  besides everything and not to sound obsessive, that i love her with all  my heart.  
I've spent the last couple of weeks reflecting over every  little thought about what went down, everything that was said, and i  know she has done the same.  


So what now?  


**Reddit** i need your help, am i really still obsessing over something that might be as well be over and forgotten?  


Should  i wait to see if she is gonna want to see me and hope that she wanna  get back together, make a stronger bond, and live happily again?  
OR  
Should i bury my heart, delete my inner self's need to see her smile and feel her in my arms once again?  


I truly love her, I've never been moved so much in my heart as when she let me listen to her voice and talk about her stories.  


TL;DR  
I've recently lost my best friend.   
And with best friend I mean someone I believed was my soulmate.   
The  love of my life. I fucked up when she needed space to get herself  together, wanting more out of her friendships and put a little breather  between me and her. After not letting her have that space, because i needed  her with my loneliness problems, i need to figure out what my next move is.",27Dec2019,1
105,"This post will be long. I created a reddit account because I needed an external opinion. This is not a throwaway account, I will continue to be in reddit afterwards, this just happens to be my first post.

This post will be about me meeting a girl (I’m a girl), also seventeen. I don’t know if I have romantic feelings. I’ve liked girls in the past, so it’s not a problem of accepting my gay side or anything. It’s just that this feeling I have for her is so strong I can’t describe it. I’m so confused about it, because it’s not friendship, it’s not a crush. It’s more than that. I’m so confused I felt like I needed and opinion from someone else. This post will be long, but please bear through it.

I’m a girl, 17, French who moved to Seoul at the beginning of August 2019. Since seventh grade, I’ve been moving every year to a different school, or even country (South Korea is my fourth county since this started) this has made me struggle to make long lasting and meaningful friendships. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve always been pretty popular, and never struggle to make friends, got invited to all the parties and what people would call a social butterfly, but all of that is temporary. After a year, I move away and everything resets itself, and I have to start the process again and again.

I think it would also be important to say that I’m an only child, and am not at all close to my parents. They’re not divorced, but my dad lives in Hong Kong for business, and my mom is just constantly moving around for work as well. I’m used to living by myself, and decided to move to Seoul for a year in a host family, because I can (that was literally my only argument when people asked me why I did it). 
 
I arrived to my classroom three days before my birthday, on a Friday, meaning my birthday would be the next Monday (important) . And since I was girl with blonde hair and blue eyes in an all Korean school, everyone went pretty wild. Everyone in my class circled me for the entire day, asking me questions and just constantly being around me. It was pretty exhausted having twenty five people all looking, circling you and listening to everything you say. Everyone came, but one person. One girl had stayed at her desk, and was simply reading a book. Sometimes she’d look up towards me, make eye contact, smile gently before going back to her book. I didn’t think too much of it, maybe she was simply shy.

On Monday, I arrived early in the classroom (like forty minutes early), it’s a habit I used to have because I used to hate being at home, and it just stuck.. I noticed the girl was also there. She was again, reading her book, alone at the desk. I went on and did my thing, until she came to me, and shyly gave me a package. A birthday present, with a letter she had written. She had written it once in English, once in Korean, so I would be able to “practice”. In the letter, she apologised for not greeting me the first day, that she wanted us to be friends, but that I seemed overwhelmed so she didn’t want to add another person to it. 

I can’t tell you her name, so I’ll call her Seulgi. 

Seulgi was the only person to wish me a happy birthday that day (no one had asked, and I never make a big fuss about it, because I usually spend my birthday alone, since my parents are busy and it’s still in the summer vacation in Europe), and it was one of my first birthday presents ever. This girl, that I had never talked to, went out of her way to ask the teacher my birthday, bought me a present and wrote me a letter. 

After that we quickly became close friends. I also realised that she totally was the mom of the class, constantly taking care of everyone, making sure everyone was okay, extremely selfless. Too selfless. If I gave her 20 candies, she’d distribute them to everyone, and only allow herself to eat one if there were any left. If we arrived in a new classroom, she’d wait for everyone to take a seat, and only take one afterwards (if there were no seats left, she’d just stay up for however long she had to.)

One day, an unfortunate event happened, and every girl present in the room started crying. I could see that Seulgi was holding back tears, but all she did would go to the person sobbing the most, comfort them, calm them down until they stopped crying. She went on like that for almost an hour, until I stopped her, and told her that she was allowed to cry too, that it was okay. Seulgi broke down crying, then panicked and ran to the bathroom so no one would see her cry. A few minutes later, she came out looking perfectly fine and resumed what she was doing, aka making everyone feel better.

The next day, she texted me thanking me, saying that she hadn’t cried in almost a year, and told me that when she was young, her dad always told her to never cry, and most importantly never cry in front of people, because then they would see that she was weak. She asked me to not think any less of her, simply because some tears escaped (I would never). 

It did alarmed me a bit, and that’s when I noticed a few things I had until then brushed off.

She would never say where she lived. She had been in that school and in that area for about five years, yet no one had ever been to her house. Every time we asked where she lived, she’d just say things like “oh it’s very far, you wouldn’t know where it is”.  She also never talked about her mom, but was very very stressed with her dad. Seulgi’s dad was very controlling, she had never been allowed to a sleepover, and couldn’t hang out with friends for too long. She had to message him about all of her whereabouts ALL THE TIME, and when he called her, she’d jump out of her seat, grab her phone quickly and walk away so no one would know what she talked about. She also always wore long sleeves, and long pants, even in the hot month of August.

That’s not it. We became very close, and she told me she wanted to be a singer (her voice is beautiful, we have been to karaoke together many times). She also told me that she had won a full paid scholarship for an art high school in the center of Seoul, but that her dad had declined it, because he wanted her to “stay close to him”. She also admitted that her dad said she would never succeed anyway, so it was stupid to go. Now I might not be a parent, but this seems like a pretty f*cked up way to tear down the confidence of your child.

Seulgi takes care of both her younger siblings, and like I said, her mom doesn’t really seem in the picture. The only time she talked to me about her, was to tell me that her mom wants her to go to college to meet a man, get married, quit college, get children and be a stay at home mom. The thing is, Seulgi has never been attracted to a guy, and she knows that she has to start soon, or her life will be extremely unhappy. She never mentioned her mom again, and I never brought her up as well. 

Let’s go back to her dad now.

Sometimes she’d say “jokingly” that she was scared to go to her house that day, because she had had a bad grade, or spilled something on her uniform. She says her dad “shakes her”, and that he’s scary, specially when he is angry.

I’ve talked seriously with her, but it’s a delicate subject, so it’s difficult. She told me that her dad loves her, that she knows it. But that he loves her so much in a way that sometimes can hurt her, but that it’s not his fault, because he still gives her a roof and she has where to sleep every night.

Seulgi is a beautiful singer, she’s very talented. One time, a few weeks ago, she forced too much on her voice, and damaged her vocal chords. For a week, she’d cough blood, barely be able to eat anything. But her father refused to bring her to the doctor (he also wouldn’t let her go by herself), and she wasn’t allowed to skip school. For the longest time, she had an open wound in her throat, and he would just leave her like that. After a while, she told me he finally agreed to bring her to the doctor, but told him to simply “give her some cold medicine so she would shut up”. She admitted to me that in that moment, she wished I would have been there with her, that she felt so small, so weak. She wanted to cry, but she knew that it would only make the situation worse.

Seulgi always took care of everyone, but deep down, it was more than that. She wanted the same. She was crying for help, for someone to notice she wasn’t doing well, but at the same time, letting people in seemed terrifying. She’d confess to me things, and then pretend she never said anything.

I always took care of her, and I think we became really close. We both had fathers completely opposite. Mine was absent, hers was all over her constantly. But it was the same result. We both didn’t feel loved.

My parents might not be around me, but they pressure me extremely academically. I sometimes don’t sleep, because I spend all night studying, or skip lunch to study. She always tells me to rest, and saves some of her lunch for me. She does little things for me, expecting for me to not notice it, she would never expect anything in return, she mostly does it in secret, simply to make me happy, putting a chocolate bar in my locker, always awaiting for me, buying me a blanket so I can sleep in the classroom.

Sometimes Seulgi comes to me, falls in my arms and starts crying. She cries for hours, completely soaking me. I never ask why. She just wants to be held.name the fact that she trusts me enough cry in front of me is something I feel extremely honoured about. We never talk about this moments afterwards. It’s our secret. We never talk about those times I faint because I don’t eat, or throw up, she just holds my hair, and calms me down. We don’t talk about those times she arrives two hours early in the classroom,  and sleeps there because she doesn’t like it at home.

Seulgi’s confidence is so low, and all I can do is be there for her. To me, she’s beautiful. To me, she’s perfect. I. Are for her so much in ways I can’t describe. English isn’t my first language, but I think that’s not the problem. The problem is that my feelings are so big for her, that I don’t think words can exist to describe it. She cates for me, and I care for her. We’re both two souls who found each other, and helped each other as best as we can.

I wouldn’t qualify those feelings as romantic feelings though. I just want to make her happy. She deserves all the happiness in the world. She deserves everything.

I lost my glasses about ago, but I was too shy to tell my parents, because I knew they’d be angry. Last Monday, after class, Seulgi took me apart after class, holding my hand, and refused to tell me where we were going. She brought me to the glasses shop. Even after my all my protesting, she still made me new glasses, and paid for them. She paid for my eye test, and my glasses. Seulgi doesn’t have much money. I do. But it wasn’t about the money, it was about her helping me. Her showing her gratefulness. She asked me to simply accept it, and never talk about it again.

Afterwards, she asked me if I had eaten that day. It was already 8pm, but I hadn’t eaten anything that day. Seulgi took me to a restaurant, and bought us dinner, she bought me two plates, and waited until I was full. She barely ate, just smiled at me lovingly, telling me that she hated the fact that I was studying the whole day with an empty stomach. She told me I should call my dad, tell him that I had found my glasses.

The idea made me nervous, and last time I called my dad, it was him telling me everything that was wrong with my essay, hanging up without having said hello or goodbye, without asking anything about my life alone in a foreign country.

But she was there, smiling at me, holding my hand, and I just couldn’t say no. 

After a few minutes, my dad answered. She saw that I was getting stressed, and calmed me down, hugging me, even if she didn’t understood a word of what my dad was speaking.  My dad told me he was glad I had found my glasses because “if I had lost them, it would have been a whole different problem.” She didn’t understand again, but after I hung up, got so excited and told me she was proud of me, and that I was so best. I felt good. For once, my heart wasn’t heavy after talking with my dad. For once, he had complimented me, instead of reprimanding me. And that was thanks to Seulgi.

After that, we went to karaoke, and she sang for me. She sang with her beautiful voice.

When Seulgi goes to karaoke, everyone knows she is there. Her voice is so unique and powerful, that everyone having heard her sing once would recognise her.

She was so beautiful. Sometimes, she’d hold my hand while she sang, and I felt so happy. (Again, Not once did the thought of kissing her cross my mind). I just... I just wanted to give her everything I had. I wanted to make her happy until the day I die. I want to keep contact with her, even after a year, even when I leave. 

After the karaoke finished, we went home. She was taking the bus, until she noticed I was staring to walk. Seulgi grabbed my hand and asked me where I was going. I said I was walking home (10pm, alone, 30 min walk). She said no, because she worried about me, and she wanted me to be Safe. I gave in after a few minutes. I didn’t have my bus card, but she paid for my bus ride. Again, I don’t have any money problems, and she knows it. She knows it but she doesn’t care. 
At my bus stop, we both got down. I was confused, because she really doesn’t live where I live.

That’s where she admitted taking the wrong bus, so I wouldn’t be alone, and that now she was going to go back at the karaoke bus stop. 

This is only an infinite fraction of all of the things that happened, but it gives you a good understanding of the person that she is.

In one night, Seulgi bought me glasses, dinner, sang for me and gave me a ride back home, distancing herself from her own home.
My brain can’t comprehend it.
I don’t understand how a human being can’t are this much about me. How can someone give so much of herself for the happiness of others ?

How can someone as beautiful as Seulgi exist ?

This world doesn’t deserve her. I don’t deserve her attention. I don’t deserve even knowing her.

I haven’t talked about other things she did, but it would always come back to the same thing. How can someone have such a s*itty life, that has been so unfair to her, and still be beautiful ?
How can someone so wrecked and broken inside keep on giving everything she has, when she barely has anything ? 

I think she’s the most perfect person in this world. 

She’s not a simple friend, but she isn’t a lover. She’s Seulgi. She’s the person I’ve ended up caring so much about that I would without hesitation give up all of my happiness for hers. I’m so confused about my feelings. 

Here is my question, reddit : What is this ? What do I feel for her ? Am I in love with her, or am I blinded by the fact that I desperately want to help her ?

Please help me,

Please save us.

Her heart is broken, yet she gives it away piece by piece, trying to make everyone around her feel the love she never had.

Seulgi.",27Dec2019,1
106,"I hate myself so much I almost feel physically when looking at myself in the mirror.
My own recurring thoughts annoy me so much that I am constantly distracting myself with watching shows, YouTube Videos, reading books and listening to music. I am a failure at life.
The only time I can stop my self hatred is every now and then going to the clubs filling myself up with drugs and partying for 2 days straight.
I am annoyed by my whining and that I actually don't really have a reason to hate myself compared to people with real problems but I can't help it.

I hate myself so much that I thought about killing myself a lot but I haven't found a safe way that I want to do it. 
So now I am on my path of self destruction with the aim of finally dying within the next few years. I know it might take a longer time, but I will work out a way that will slowly drag me down. Not taking care of my health in general, putting on weight, no physical exercise, not seeing the doctor anymore, daily use of alcohol and drugs will do the trick. I deserve this and this is my final direction.",27Dec2019,1

1. Freezer space. 
So i have my own fridge in my room. I only need to use the freezer in the kitchen. I worry that when I go back that there wont be space for my food. The girl I dont talk to anymore is very aggressive and bossy, I rather not deal with her either

2. My close friend
Im unsure if I should be as close with anymore because I feel that my ego will get the best of me and I will feel strong emotions by the fact that she will be hanging out with that other girl in the house.

I fucked up when she needed space to get herself together, wanting more out of her friendships and put a little breather between me and her. 
After not letting her have that space, because i needed her closeness with my loneliness/stress/depression and absence from work problems, i need to figure out what my next move is.

I truly love her, I've never been moved so much in my heart as when she let me listen to her voice and talk about her past life.

She woke an interest in me for the beautiful world, as she saw it and explained how the world is experienced by her.

I believe that what we had in the first 4 months is what people talk about when they explain their feelings and thoughts about true love.

Should i wait to see if she is gonna want to see me and hope that she wanna get back together, make a stronger bond, or even just give me a hug once again?

114,"I still can't believe it!!

Me and her have been really good friends for a while now. Super open, there's so many things I've told her that I haven't told anyone else. I've only ever dated guys before, so I didn't know for sure if I was bisexual or not. It always felt wrong calling myself that label since I felt like I hadn't ""earned"" it. I hadn't done anything physical with a girl so how would I know? I don't hold that standard for other people, it's just what I apply to myself. She's bisexual, and never been with another girl, but she's expressed to me how much she wants to.

I broke up with my boyfriend some time ago. Recently I've been feeling this urge to experiment with another girl and find out for sure how it all feels. The moment she popped into my head, I couldn't get her out. I started imagining different scenarios with her, and couldn't stop thinking about it. I invited her over to my house and we were watching videos on my lil beanbag, when I laid my head on her shoulder and started clinging to her arm. I've never been physical with any of my friends before, even with her, so I wonder if she noticed something was different.

Anyway, I invited her over again yesterday, and put on some movies. I was sitting next to her on the couch, my hands on her arm. I'd promised myself I'd go further, so I put my arm across her and held her side. One thing led to another and I was holding her hand. She jokingly apologized that they might be a little sweaty. I can't believe I was holding her hand. My other hand was on her thigh. Like, holy shit. Holy shit! Holy shit, it was crazy!!

She sat up to change positions and I got worried for a second, like, oh no, did I misread the signals? Are you not into this?  But she just shifted over to lying on the couch, with me on top of her, my head on her chest and my hands wrapped around her holding onto her lower back. Holy shit!! Holy shit!! I didn't think it could get any better!! My head was literally in between her tiddies!! My other hand was literally on her back, and her shirt had gone up a bit, and my hands were!! On her skin!! Holy shit!!! I suppose I might be bisexual!!

She didn't act any different than normal whenever I walked her out to her car. I wonder what's going through her head, or what she's thinking. I keep wondering if I'm misreading the signals. Is it possible this could all be platonic? Do girls cuddle with each other like this, and hold hands? Or is this obviously something more?

I'm going to invite her over to sleep over. We'll both be next to each other in my bed. I wonder if I'll be able to kiss her then. This shit is crazy. I'm so excited. I'm already itching to see her again. I hope she feels the same way.",27Dec2019,1
115,"About a week ago my friend group was having some hard times. One of them had a crush and he confessed her. The girl he liked has a friend group that includes my crush too. He got friendzoned and cut all his connections with that group and banned us to contact with them. My only connection with her was cut down. Then all my friends leave our whatsapp group and it was only me there. I was like “what” the hell happened here. Because I wasn’t online at that moment. So we closed our instagram account, I closed it actually and my “having a christmas with friends” dream went far away.
There isn’t any debate or something and we are all good actually but, we are not close like we used to be. So I can’t speak with my crush (she doesn’t love me btw) and I can’t do anything on christmas and it was a big deal for me. Whenever I got isolated from people I feel sad and as I see the only thing I want from christmas is peace",27Dec2019,1

118,"Having to review random videos for a customer, part of a quality control thing with video records.

There is one public worker that wears a body cam that sounds like a fricking pug...

Its supposed to be random but his videos have come up 11 times this week and it's driving me crazy having to listen to his pug breathing...

I'm not a skinny fella, i'm a bit of a pudge, but jesus how is this man functional with his breathing being that bad.

He breaths like a pug sitting down in his truck between jobs...i just want to skip the damn things when he comes up, or yell at him to blow his damn nose...",27Dec2019,1
120,On Christmas Eve I had a medical emergency and had to leave work in the middle.of my shift. I literally lost my vision. Today my boss called and yelled at me about it. I'm getting written up at work. I guess I'm lucky not to be fired. But my parents are pissed at me for getting my hair cut and because I owe them money. They spent half the day yelling at me for it. Now my fiance is upset with me because I told her how I was feeling. Idk. Just want to give up.,27Dec2019,1
121,"This isn't a deep post about depression. I'm literally just really bored. I do college (UK) a couple days a week and work on the weekends. I see friends during the week but on the days I don't, like today, I do a bit of work and then just sit in my room having no idea what to do. I'm bored of games and television and shit. I wanna actually do something.

Can anyone suggest something to do? I already go to the gym. I'm 21 and hopefully going to university next year (I left it late), if that helps contextually. I'm up for joining some kind of group or club but I wouldn't know what, and it doesn't have to be along those lines, just hit me with any suggestions please! :)",27Dec2019,1

i mean i do, but it dosn't make sense

Usually i'd say i'm pretty calm. But for some reason, when a programm seems to work against me, it infuriates me beyond reason

the first time i noticed this was when i wanted to know the original title of a youtube video

(i'm from germany and as you might know, youtube auto-translates the titles of some foreign languaged videos. the translations are usually pretty crappy)

anyway, i tried multiple ways, at the end i tried with TOR, and it. just. kept. on. translating. the. F-ing. title.


right now, i wanted to make a account on a webside (question-answer kind of thing) and. it. just. doesnt. want. my. email. adress.

128,"And I’m really worried about him. Normally, he’s the life of the party, chatting and laughing. Christmas has always been his favorite time of year. His mother (who’s passed on) LOVED Christmas and he’s always kind of honored her by celebrating in big ways. 

Instead, this year he was so cranky and miserable that more than one relative (from both sides) commented about his demeanor. 

He berated our daughter for minor infractions and stressed everyone out about things being on the table *exactly* when he wanted them. 

I struggle with depression myself and think I’m beginning to see the signs of anxiety and depression coming through in him. (He’s been getting progressively more bent out of shape over smaller and smaller things.) 

I’m not excusing his behavior but I know from experience that fighting your way back to your normal is exhausting when you’re swimming in anxiety and depression. 

I’ve been direct, I’ve beaten around the bush, suggested therapy, taking a semester off, couples counseling... He swears he’s ‘fine’ and complains that I’m the one who’s being confrontational. 

I really miss the man I married. 
I wish I knew how to help him come back to us.",27Dec2019,1
129,"Background : I'm an 18 year old male and am currently on semester break. 

Problem : I cannot go out often on my own accord. My hometown has terrible public transportation as compared to the city my college is in. When I moved to college, my mental and physical health improved immensely mostly due to the ability to go anywhere at anytime with low cost (Trains and Busses).  Now that I am at home again (for a month on semester break), I rarely leave the house, and I am going crazy.

Reasons :-

• Dependency on other people
- Ever since my birth, I've always had to rely on others to send me anywhere. Be it my dad, brother or grandfather: I'd always end up getting scolded at for something if I asked them to transport me anywhere. For example, if my plans don't align with theirs, they will convey a vibe that comes across as me being a burden which is really uncomfortable for me. In general, it's safe to say that asking them to send and pick me up from anywhere is just unpleasant, and it has resulted in me avoiding going out in general.

• Driving.
- I rewrote this part numerous times and each time, I fantasised about smashing things on the floor. Ok, so, basically: I will never be given the faith to drive alone anywhere until I get my own car.",27Dec2019,1

131,"I don’t know if I want to tell them either.

My mum is a wonderful person and I’m sure she’d accept of it but idk if she would tell my dad or not. He’s had a *less than stellar* track record with homophobia, and when my aunt announced that they were selling their house to a young gay couple 2 days ago, he walked around to all of us whispering “Did you hear that [my aunt] sold their house to a bunch of lezzas?” 

I’m torn. I have no idea whether I should tell them and risk getting kicked out or keep hiding it. I hate lying about huge things like this and having to hide it for a year has been extremely difficult. I really need some advice here.",27Dec2019,1

134,"i was sexually assaulted when i was 15 years old, which is something 97% of people don't know about me. i couldn't even say it out loud until i was 18 years old, which is when i told someone for the first time. i tend to dust it under the rug and pretend it didn't happen. i typically only tell men i date and anticipate getting intimate with because i want them to understand that i require patience and that they absolutely won't make or see me climax. though i was not raped, what happened has impacted me in a way so significant that i've never allowed myself to accept the repercussions in their entirety. for years i couldn't even stand the thought of a man holding my hand, let alone kissing me or anything beyond that. i'll never forget being 19 and violently shaking just because the guy i was dating asked to kiss me. we didn't kiss and he kindly took me home. i wasn't able to kiss anyone until i was 20, when i pushed myself to lose my virginity because i was ashamed of my age and lack of experience. it was a weird time for me. while i worked through it emotionally, i didn't even come close to orgasming. with the next, and only two partners i have ever slept with, i still was unable to orgasm. i had a weird jealousy when friends would talk about great, intense sex they had with their partners because whatever demons lurk in my brain have made it impossible for me to dive into a sexual experience and feel the degree of pleasure i deserve to as a young woman.

tonight—for the first time in my 22 years of life—i nearly reached an orgasm, all by myself. i am so close to experiencing something i never thought i'd be able to in this lifetime. it's amazing because i began to accept the fact that i would never finish with myself or a partner. i am so strangely proud of myself and extremely excited to embrace one of the most human experiences life offers. i'm finally taking back something that i thought i lost a long time ago and am so eager to let it bleed into future relationships.",27Dec2019,1
