3,"I dont know what to do.Theres this girl that we hanged around ~2-3 months ago a couple of times.I really liked her.. but long story short things got messed up.I dont really know.Fast forward now,Its not that I am in love with her,its the fact that I didn't succeed in actually making a move on her.Its crazy how much someone can change in a couple of months.Back then i was starting socialising and going outside after a year of studying,staying at home  and writing the biggest exams of my life that got me into the university I am now.I succeeded.Its a good university.I was a lot more introverted then and I truly believe if I had met her now..with the confidence I have i would have succeeded,she would have fell for me,but i was weak.Idk if im bipolar or anything nowadays though,sometimes i feel emotionally weak,sitting at home,taking pity on myself, significantly lowered confidence, listening to depressing songs,thinking about her..mostly..other times I am supreme,I feel like a god,Like a champion,supreme level of confidence,more social,more motivated with a supreme attitude.I dont really now wtf is going with me.I swear the fact that it didnt work out with that chick is in my back of my mind 24/7 just sitting there reminding me of it.I still try to chat with her on ig,i bet she wants that other guy,that guy that she made out with after we stopped talking for a bit..Im thinking of deleting my social media,im thinking of just university-hustle-boxing-home.All that till i get into a right mind,till i have the body of a greek god.To show her what she lost,to gain her back..If i stay at home and go out,I wont smoke too since all my friends smoke.I dont smoke so much maybe 3-4 cigs if I go out but still,it fucks with my mind,it affects my training phycologically.Maybe I should do that.Focus on studying and working out.Shit sorry for the complicated post.Too many things and with little context.Reddit helps.A lot.Great communities with great people.Thanks for reading.Tomorrow at morning I will sit and think.Maybe I'll go for a run too.Breath some fresh air.",01Dec2019,1
4,"I’m not suicidal, just wanted to put that out there!


I’ve been feeling so helpless, hopeless, stressed out, and disgusted with myself lately. It’s gotten to the point where I can’t even get out of bed some days. I feel like I have a dark cloud of energy surrounding me all the time preventing me from being productive or feeling happy. I can’t stop crying and feeling sad. 

I stopped doing things I enjoy because I feel like I don’t deserve to be happy. On top of all of this, my family is toxic and they make it difficult for me to feel good about myself and my future. I’ve felt like this for most of my adolescence and early 20s, but now that I’m in nursing school this high stress program is compounding the problem. 

I can’t focus on completing my assignments and going to lecture feels like a chore, even though I used to enjoy it. I can’t even work part-time as an LPN to support myself financially because our program is too taxing on me as it is. We have very heavy courses.

I’m sick of taking care of myself and going out in public in general. Getting out of bed is a fucking struggle, I just lay in it and bawl. I really want to tell everyone to fuck off, withdraw from my classes, pack some bags, and head to fuckin Bora Bora for a few months. I’m so burnt out already and I haven’t even graduated yet! 

I hate to complain but I really needed to vent. If anyone has any suggestions for how to bring myself out of this funk I’d really appreciate it.",01Dec2019,1
5,"Warning: drug use involved. And long. This chick is quite a story. 

Background: my bf and I have been together for almost a year and a half next month. Best time of my life. We both love blow and did it often together until I found out I was pregnant. We have a 3 month old together. The ex let’s call her H and my bf (A) share a 2/3 year old. Let me tell y’all when baby mama drama is DRAMA it’s like nothing else. And she’s the oldest out of our situation. Go figure.

I never minded my boyfriend having a kid from a past relationship. It never effected his character. He’s genuinely the greatest guy ever. I’ve never been treated SO WELL in a relationship. Of course we have our disagreements but who doesn’t? Disclaimer: He has no intentions of ever getting back with her, so I don’t feel insecure (at least anymore). She’s freaking nuts. Now.. let’s get to her. 

H is so freaking manipulative. She checks all of the boxes to signs of a narcissist. Like truly. When she first found out about me last December, (we didn’t want to tell her since it was obvious she was still hung up on my bf and has sent herself pictures of only herself or would text him asking of his opinion on random shit) She changed her number and wouldn’t let him contact her any way other than email. She doesn’t let him video chat his son. He’s lucky enough if she’d reply on his questions of updates about him. And it’s hardly ever. 

H had a very very heavy Xanax addiction. Kicked out of a private uni for pharmacy school, disowned by family, had to attend NA meetings THREE times a week, no home. Who helped her get her BACK into that prestigious school and got her degree and her freaking career?! My boyfriend! He supported her for EVERYTHING the 4 years they were together so she could focus on school and get clean. And she did until she relapsed. 

They’ve had times where she’s had secret stashes and he’d find them. While she’s barred out, she’s a different person. She’d physically hurt him for flushing it. Total fiend.  He would know if her personality changes even in the slightest. This isn’t a fun drug guys, it’s scary. I don’t have any desire to try any after hearing his experience with her. 

She got clean then boom she was pregnant. She also got her degree about a month after giving birth. 6 months postpartum she relapsed again and since there’s a child in the picture, he called it quits. While they were trying to “work on” their relationship she went behind his back and bought herself a brand new car. With his money. She didn’t have one at the time. He’d drop her off and pick her up with his truck. There was a time she called him while he was at work to ask for more of his money and she went out to buy some. With the baby in the backseat. A could hear him crying over the phone. He totally freaked out. He was angry. The apartment was under his name so she moved out with the baby and stayed with her parents for the time being. This was around month 10/11 of 2017. 

She told him around Christmas time that year she’s taking the kid to visit her sister in FL. Doesn’t even let him spend their kid’s first Christmas with him. A month later after dodging his calls wanting to see their son, she told him she moved to SC. With the kid. He had no idea. He was crushed. He paid for her final exam for her to get her license and leave with no warning. In SC soon after CPS had taken the kid into custody because she was pulled over after bars. He was crushed. He and his best friend drove up there to try to get him hack. About a month after they were able to release him to his mother. 

That was all before me. So. Let’s get to how she’s the biggest manipulative bitch. God where do i even start?? January of this year she found out what I look like and told A “I didn’t know you were into chubby girls now” ON MY BIRTHDAY. I WAS PREGNANT. She then apologized to him the next day and claimed she was drunk. Whatever. Cunt.

This is every single fucking lie she told me over that past week: my boyfriend physically assaulted her after a coke binge and kicked her out. We do coke together and he has NEVER laid a finger on me. Choked her in front of her mom. My boyfriend respects parents SO MUCH. He doesn’t even like it if I raise my voice at mine! Said he was sleeping off a binge while she was in labor for 7 hours. Left and went looking for painkillers while she was giving birth. Took her painkillers after she did. I had the absolute best birth experience with him. He never left my side. He wasn’t sleeping off no binge. He didn’t ask for my painkillers. KILLED HER CAT. Like wtf??? Claimed she had a miscarriage before this baby when he can’t even recall if she truly was pregnant that time to begin with. Said she miscarried at home while he was working. I’m pretty sure he’d remember that. He suffered a few miscarriages from a serious relationship long before us. Apparently to this delusional bitch, he NEVER worked! Wtf! They met AT WORK. She moved in to HIS apartment. He made more money than her! Does she think I’m an idiot?? Apparently he’s cheated on her twice on Facebook messenger. Now, he has cheated in one relationship that only time (not with her) and I believe him when he said he’d never do it again. I feel the same way since I’ve also gone through that. She picked a name of a girl she didn’t think I’d know that’s a long time friend of his! She has a bf. My god. She claims she ended their relationship due to his constant use of blow and “trust issues”. Claims he said he’s addicted and needs help. My bf does very moderate blow if I’m honest. He doesn’t buy it, it’s free and it’s never more than half a gram. God she just dragged him through the mud to get me on her side. Does she not know how delusional she sounds???? She claims she got married a couple of months ago to this “amazing guy”. I don’t believe it for shit. She posts no pictures of them together. She did however sent me a pic of a male with her son. But that could be anybody wtf?? Said he’s been with her since the kid was 8 months. So to my knowledge, right when she moved. But she claims they’ve been long time friends and met in our hometown. Been with him for that long and you still send selfies to my bf?? Without the kid even in it?? You’re sick. Claims A kicked her out of this truck while it was moving, had pics of the bruises from every abuse.. but guess what? She lost the phone. How convenient. And she said the truck has a dent because of that. No way. It was because of her fucking driving. There’s not one shred of evidence to anything she’s said that could say is true. Nothing. And there is government documents from court when she did get kicked out of school if you looked her up on Google. Court dates my bf paid for to get her back into school. Apparently always out til 5AM after work doing blow with friends. This is literal bull because he works 12 hour shifts/6 days then AND now and he comes home every night to get as much sleep as he can for work. 

This is two things she’s tried to get in between us by telling me. 1. He sent her an email she thinks he’s reminiscing a happy memory of them and it’s “cheating on me” since it was 2 weeks ago. The woman is so fucking fragile and is holding their kid hostage of course he has to walk on eggshells to you! I know as long as he’s with me, she’ll stay resentful. 2. She told me “I don’t know when you guys got together, but when he was staying at (his best friend’s) house we were still seeing each other.” I’m laughing. She really thought she could get me with this?? We didn’t even meet til a year after THAT! We met long after she left the state! Fucking troll. 

She tries to manipulate me into thinking my bf is a drug addict, toxic, abuser, and liar WHEN IT’S ALL HER! Tried to get to my sweet side and encouraged me to leave him over her lies???? When she first found out about me, she tried to get him to break up with me! That’s why she’s changed numbers. Now it’s the other way around?? What. The. Fuck. Another toxic trait, she has made up such exaggerated stories of my boyfriend’s “wrongdoings” but played the victim the WHOLE time. Like she hadn’t fucked up at all?? She fucked up his credit score before she skipped town. She took their kid halfway across the country without his knowledge. But no. She’s the angel. The victim. Fucking toxic. 

The first reason she tried to contact me was because she’s emailed A into demanding him signing away his rights as a father and she’ll change the kid’s last name to hers. She told me she wants to change it to her new “husband’s” last name so he wouldn’t feel left out when she changes hers. I have yet to see a pic of dear husband. She still uses her own last names. And apparently is taking the kiddo on a Disney cruise abroad. What a load of bull. The cruise i believe, she’s stacked with money. The husband? Iffy. She even dodged my questions about him or gave vague answers. Her stories does not add up at all. It’s almost kind of funny that a real person is this fucking bonkers. 

My boyfriend misses his son so deeply. Tells me the heartbreak he feels every waking day. He wishes to at least be able to FaceTime. But noooooo. Crazy ass here. He hopes she’s still clean although he’s worried she’s using again with what she had told me. She threatened me if I don’t get him to sign it by this Friday she’ll file child support and apparently he’d go to jail. If she does, she’ll have to come back here and my bf will fight for his rights and he will be clean the whole time and not look back. The reason he’s hesitant on wanting to sign it is because he’s so worried of them traveling abroad and something horrible would happen to his kid and he can’t do anything about it. He would send her money monthly, but the bitch won’t even give out her bank info! She just wants a damn signature for a fucking cruise and is willing to cost us our main financial resource and his freedom. 

There it is. Off my chest. Honestly what’s her lost is my gain. My boyfriend is seriously the fucking best. Hard working, great dad, still tries weekly date nights for us. What can I say? I’m sorry you didn’t have the greatest experience with him? Fuck you mo!

Also just found out she lied about her birthday! Wth! There’s not even a marriage certificate for her and her new “husband”. And she’s already threatened to file child support just for her own amusement. She won’t accept us sending money to her directly. She’s financially wealthy. She doesn’t even want to give us her address so we can send him our gifts.",01Dec2019,2
6,"I'm 32 years old and have been divorced (unhealthy relationship) for a few years now. I dated a little after to try it but didn't have much interest. If love finds me I'm open but I've decided to pursue building my own life rather than pursue dating apps and meeting potential partners. I'm introverted but have strong friendships and a job that I love. 

As a start to my newfound independence I pursued a masters degree which I just finished a few weeks ago and have more time again. I'm not really sure yet what my next adventure is going to be. I want to be a mother, and I've also had this make believe storyline in my head since I was a kid that I would love to write and try to have published. 

I decided today to pursue fertility testing to get an idea of whether my body has much more time for pregnancy or not. It should be around the new year that everything will have been assessed and my results are in. If my tests indicate that I have time, I'm going to start writing my book. If they don't, I'm going to start looking seriously into artificial insemination. I've always been an improviser who goes with my intuition, so anticipating such a black and white result is both terrifying and oddly comforting.",01Dec2019,1
7,"First of all , I am usually not that kind of guy that open ups his heart. I am rather that kind of guy that would`d make fun of people who post cringy stuff like this.
Just to make clear how pathetic I feel rn.

Anyway.
Me :
 19yr Old/M living in Germany (Turkish Boi)

A cople of years ago I started at a new school. New place , (almost) new people but the same me. An İntrovert that makes fun of everyone and everything and is known to be impolite. Not managing to socialite with anybody I didn't knew before.
But there was this one Girl. For most of the people she definitely would`nt be the prettiest or funniest. But for me she was , even if she kinda (for some) dressed ""like man"".

I kept on being me. Making fun of everyone with my friends , even her. At some point I tried to stop. Trying to hold back when she once again was being gossiped , screaming inside that she isn't what they think she is , telling myself again &amp; again that she isn't the least beautiful person in class but 1st. But I couldn't tell her. Not only didn't I fear her answer but also the reactions from my classmates.

Time passed by and I slowly tried to establish some typ of contact. Making Jokes with her or about the topics she likes and not about her. Trying to spend time with her in the breaks. We became friends quickly. Pretty good ones. Her Humour , Worldview , Behaviour... everything seemed to be just too perfect to be realistic.
She invited me to Events like the Comic Con and our chats became more private. She told me about her issues  and I told her about my , issues that I've never ever mentioned.
But the more time I spend with her the more I became obsessed.
At some point I colored my hair multiple times because she also has colored her , just the have a reason to talk to her , to get closer (talk about her opinion , tips...). My Hair currently has metallic colour. Even pierced my ear just to become more of a guy she probably would like (as I thought). I tried to shape me the way I thought she would like more.

She invited me to her Birthday and around that time I found out she has a BF. As crushed as I was I didn't know whether I should go or not. Her Birthday was on a Friday and she`d return on Thursday night from a Trip. I made contact with her sister , bought her a ring and asked her to place it on her desk , later asking Her to keep the present as a secret. I managed to make her smile that day. Maybe I shouldn't have but I still went to her Birthday (with a 2nd less showy gift) and as expected saw her ""hang out"" with her BF. I was crushed that night.

Cople of Days later I confronted her with my feelings. Telling her everything I wanted to for months , maybe years. Also that I , eventhough I had weeks and months of self talk behind me , was never brave enough to have one scenario in which we came together. Because she just seemed to be too perfect to be real.

She kinda rejected me. Still telling me that she`d love to keep me as a friend. And so we did. But not for too long. ~3 very difficult weeks later I finally knew that I couldn't just ""be friends"" while feeling differently. I told that it`d probably be the best , maybe for me , to stop hoping (rejecting to even stay in contact via WhatsApp..)
I think I was ready to let go thethat night. But than she kept on texting after my last words.

I made many of stupid stupid mistakes in my life that cost me alot (even the relationship with my bad). But what she told me that night is the one I regret most.

-&gt; She Told that she had a crush on me since the beginning. She was never brave enough to tell me. Thinking that I would reject. Make Fun. Like I always do (did?). Keeping it for herself , like I did , trying to forgett. And then I started texting her about my feelings. Barely Weeks after she had a BF. And she didn't know what to do. Feeling like betraying , (either me?) or him.
Telling me things like ""İf you just told me earlier , I would've chosen you in the blick of an eye"".
Even sending me how she had written an emotional ""speech"" from me to her (while she had issues with her dad) into her ""Notepad/Diary-Thing""
That was Thursday this week.


The next day we barely talked. I felt like an Empty Shell. Trying to act like I didn't care , trying to be the clown the whole class knows me like. But I couldn't. After school I ultimately asked her whether she loved me or not , because I do. She said ""I don't know"". She needed time and wanted to text at night.
I waited but nothing came. I sat there ,  with my phone on my desk , just starring at the Wall , texting her that I  need an answer. I sat there till I had to go to work the next morning.

Later that day (which is Today) she texted back :
İts to complicated to be love. She once did but...The fact that she wasn't able to say immediately means something. 
I asked her whether it would've been possible without her current BF , receiving the Answer : ""I think so , maybe"". İ had my last words (I shouldn't) and she blocked me.

I was also invited to a Birthday Party tonight. I really was not in the mood but I still went there. A Hour into to the Event her Boyfriend texted me. İnsulting Me , Telling me how pathetic I am (probably true) and that I shouldve let go way earlier. That I just don't get it (probably true?).
İn all honesty , the İnsults were unnecessary. I could beat down 5 of his kind easily , without effort. So I told him that everything is true but the İnsults , either tell it to my face or just let it be.

She herself now took over. She gave me her Answer. İ told her that priority is her being Happy , above all. And if that is true I should accept that now. 
İts him. Him above me. İt's a No. I should be taking back the ring , I told her to just throw it away. İt has no value anymore. We won't be talking anymore.

And now I am here. Going to a Friend to seek Help after leaving the party immediately and now with nerves on the edge sitting and writing this way too long text. I don't know where to go from here.

Not even once I met someone that was somewhat a 5/10 for me (not just speaking about the look). I've encountered 2/10 , 3/10 but she was a straight 10/10. Perfection. And now I have to let it go.
Over the years I managed to become less sensitive , simply accepting that life isnt meant to be Joyful for everyone. But with her in my life I started hoping. Thinking (Knowing?) that she is the right lid for my pot.
For fucking once I was happy about going to bed to stand up the next morning.
For just fucking once I believed and was too optimistic. But now I landed where I belong , on the ground of hard facts.

I now know that this isn't the story of how I became Happy.
İt's the one of how I almost became Happy

9,"So I have been experiencing chronic migraines for about 3 years and chronic fatigue for about 6 months, both of which take quite a toll on my quality of life. I even had to drop out of college due to health issues, which was quite a disappointment. A large part of the problem is that I have also have had panic disorder attached to doctors/needles/etc this entire time, and no amount of anxiety medicine has been able to get me through an appointment, let alone get blood drawn.

This week for the first time in my life I tried a new anxiety medication that actually WORKED, had a successful appointment, and got blood drawn! Not only am I celebrating my newfound ability to go to the doctor and get treatment without having a panic attack, but my lab results also offered some answers! I have an infection of some sort, an under active thyroid, and an iron deficiency. While this might seem like bad news, I am so so excited that I now have proof that something is wrong and my symptoms aren’t all in my head AND I can work on a treatment plan with my doctor.

I  have just finished my bachelors degree and have secured a new job, but  its in a new city completely so when my contract starts in April 2020  I'll be moving two hours away to the new place. But everytime I think  about me moving i want to live out my fantasy of ""starting a new life""  and leaving my parents and sibling behind, my two long standing friends  and all the people from this place behind. I have the urge to just self  isolate and block them all, dont tell them where I live and change my  phone number. Does anyone have experience with this urge to isolate and  ""start fresh.""

I have Bipolar  disorder, still ""unspecified of type,"" however my psych believes it  would be BP1 or schizoaffective. But I guess what I want to know is that  if anyone else gets the urge during irritable depressive epsiodes to  cut off all of your friends and pretend they never existed. I have two  longstanding friends who have both seen how easily I have cut people off  and acted like they didnt mean shit to me and like they never existed  and they seem scared how easily I can do it? They have asked me multiple  times how I am so comfortable doing it and I think they are scared I  will do it to them? But in the same breath I'm also planning to.

One  of my friends have moved into mine and my husbands house and our  friendship is fine but I get these urges to throw all of her shit onto  our driveway and tell her to fuck off out of my life.

I  think I'm having issues trying to tell what type of episode Im having  at the moment, I cant tell if im irritable depressed or irritable  hypomanic.

14,"Now I know what's been keeping me away from forming relationships of any sort. I was always doing my best to think of everything as logical as possible. It has been working out nicely, people value me for the help I offer them, all the advices and support. I've created an amazing supporting community (had to create my own ""family""). But now I see that under this l o g i c a l lifestyle I've been trying to hide all that trauma, all that formed unconciousness pushing me into things I know aren't good for me. I cant figure out what I'm trying to hide from, since I'm scared if I get it out to examine it I might waste past 4 years of my teenage isolation to ""delete"" anything that could prevent me from beigng a normal part of a society. The point is, being friends, loving a friend, it's all very logical and easy to control. When it comes to a significant other, I can see that to try to love someone, things from inside of me have to come out. I know everything about healthy love patterns and how it should look like, but when it comes to my unconcious love patterns... I find myself being magnetised to people that offer me physical comfort, I'm magnetised to being used. I'm scared I might manipulate my lover into patterns that I still didn't explore, since i ""reasoned myself out of them"" but they might still be there. I might start getting too emotional, might be controlling, might get too attached. Might abuse the person I care about, or let them abuse me and have no problem with it.

18,"So I dont want this to be a pity party I just wanted to write down a little realization that I had last night and wanted to just see what other people think of it. 

So last night I was pretty hungover and just got off my shift at work and decided to listen to a mini documentary of Bo Burnham on youtube on my way home. At the end of one of his specials he said that this was the end of the show and that he hoped everyone was happy. In the documentary the guy narrating said Bo wants to make people happy because he cannot make himself happy. That kinda got me thinking and I wondered if I was happy. I figured I wasn't which isnt a surprise since no one can be happy all the time but then I remembered that I I havent really ever been happy. 

I've definitely had my times of smiling and laughing and thinking everything in the world was right but those were always far, few between and fleeting, and everytime I feel happy these days there is always an underlying feeling if dread and whatnot. Most of my thoughts are filled with negativity and I constantly have to tell myself that I'm not fucking up. Granted I'm 20 and that's just how it be sometimes.

A good example of this is the Navy. I'm in the reserves so I show up for one weekend a month but it isnt that to me. To me it fills my head just about everyday. I feel like a fuck up with it. 

Idk like I said I dont want this to be a pity party just because even though it sucks this is just how it's always been with me so its normal. I'm not saying it's a terrible bad thing. And like I also said before I'm only 20 and from what I've seen a lot of young people think their lives are over so I might just be overreacting but I do know that there hasn't really been a time in my life where I can look back and say, yeah I was happy then. Every good memory i have is also coupled with bad juju vibes. 

Idk i just wanted to throw that out there and see if this is just something everyone goes through or feels. The title might be a bit hyperbolic but it's a good thesis statement. Thanks.",01Dec2019,1

21,"I don’t know if it just me or I have a thing about people offering me help. Usually I would look at it as a sign of weakness and dependency. In the person who offer help’s perspective would be:
-Oh, that person is struggling, I should help him

While in my perspective as a person who struggle with something:
-Oh they pitying me and help me on something, I’m such a useless and dependent person

Of course that wouldn’t actually apply if I ask for help. Those mindset of mine usually occur when someone offer me some help without me asking.

For example if I carry something heavy and I seem to be struggling and someone offer to carry it for me. My brain just translated that action to “You are pathetic and how dare you letting someone do that for you”

Or maybe in a math homework that I can’t seem to figure out how to solve a problem and someone start helping me by guiding me through. And my brain translates it to “you are such a dumbass, even a grade 4 can just figure it out. You better off just work in a McDonald or something, you’re too dumb for complicated jobs” 
And the list go on.",01Dec2019,1
22,"After struggling to get off of Kratom, and particularly Phenibut recently, I thought of the whole “Say No to Drugs” slogan and how I actually agree with it given my current perspective on things. (Applying to everything except weed and perhaps very responsible/self-disciplined people; I don’t want to offend any responsible users if there are any)

It’s not the message that’s bad, it’s the way anti drug campaigns and DARE attempted to get it across when I was in middle school.

I wish I knew then what I know now concerning addiction, tolerance, withdrawals, etc. I would have been much more likely to take them serious. Instead, due to my experience with weed, I knew they were just a joke because of how far off and wrong they with with the scare tactics they used. 

After trying weed and smoking it for a couple years, some coworker friends at a Waffle House (my job when I was 17) offered me Xanax. My brother (19 at the time) was also working with us and seemed to have fun with it. I joined in. We would party on weekends (the coworkers were in their mid-30s...).

About half a year later, they introduced us to painkillers. It was like meeting God. I felt on top of the world. My coworkers never mentioned the long term downsides of using and my ignorance and enjoyment of the high led me to continue buying these drugs from wherever I could get them, using them maybe once or twice a week only at this point.

After going away to college, I found out what withdrawals were. I suffered tremendously, but eventually was sober and happy again.

Next summer, the pills were harder to find and I only used here and there. And then I had my wisdom teeth taken out. I was prescribed Vicodin’s and after binging through them to get high, something turned on in me and I became desperate to chase the high.

I started a new summer job painting and met a coworker who bought a whole prescription of 90 Percocet 15s from his mom. The whole painting crew was buying. I started buying too, leading up to a point where I was spending $400 a week on Percocets (basically my entire pay; I lived at home and got rides from my brother). When I went back to school next Fall, I had the worst withdrawals of my life. I missed the first two weeks of classes and my clueless roommate almost forced me to go to the hospital because he was so worried about my sickness/“flu”. Eventually I got better (couple weeks). 

Then came what I was waiting for — thanksgiving break. My brother back home told me about a stash where he would occasionally get a few Vicodin’s and I couldn’t wait to try it myself. My grandparents had a closet full of expired pills they weren’t using (they’re against modern medicine, particularly antidepressants, anti-anxiety and pain medicines) and I risked raising eyebrows by going upstairs to their bedroom every time I was at their house, taking what I could to school with me after every holiday and weekend I could go home. Over time, I found and used Vicodin’s, tramadol, and codeine until their stash was empty.

That lead me to searching for a new source of happiness, and I met a new coworker the next summer who had a suboxone prescription. I wasted a majority of my pay on this until I went back to school again with what I could and then dealt with tapered withdrawals. During the taper, I found out about kratom. 

Since then, I haven’t used any other pills and don’t get high anymore, I simply keep my cravings for harder pills at bay — and after some self awareness and maturation decided I wouldn’t take any more pills even if they were given to me. I hate them and what they’ve done to me. They changed me entire life and who I am. I’ve lived in guilt knowing I’ve been hiding my drug use from my parents. They’ve made me depressed as fuck time and time again, and I’ve lost any sense of how to live a happy life without a drug dependency.

In the process of reaching this realization, I tried other drugs I could get my hands on. LSD, MDMA, cocaine, methanphetamine (street crystal, adderall, vyvanse, Ritalin), and got benzo’s whenever possible (Valium, klonopin, Xanax, fake Xanax, and somewhat related — Phenibut).

I think all this drug use permanently changed me and my brain chemistry and it makes me extremely depressed as I wonder where I’d be without all of it. I wonder how much happier I’d be. How much more intelligent I could be. Etc.

the MDMA in particular really fucked me up. I only used it three times, but the second and third times were consecutive doses that left me with never before experienced anxiety levels that took two years to ALMOST go away. With that anxiety also came a new experience — I can’t smoke weed without having a panic attack anymore. I used to be able to smoke bowl after bowl or blunt after blunt, now I can hardly take a single hit without panicking. At the height of the anxiety, one hit of weed would send me into a full blown panic attack and my chest would be in so much pain.... it’s just so weird that a two day span of drug use (MDMA) changed me to where I can no longer smoke weed like I used to (and unfortunately it was the only positive drug experience I’d had). 

I’ve been wanting to get off of kratom but am finding it impossible as I can’t function at work or school without it, and without my usual dosing. I heard of a product called BlissX that could be a replacement/help me quit and started using it. Several months later I’ve been dependent on it since, and while it helped at first and while I did get off of it once, I ended up taking enough to get high again and ended up using it more and more again here recently. That’s when I discovered it’s actually PHENIBUT. Which has terrible withdrawals and dependency issues when used like this. 

Now I’m super fucking depressed because I know my depression won’t be going away any time soon and because I was tricked into using a substance I didn’t realize I was using (BlissX is marketed as a natural remedy type deal). Idk. I fucked my whole life up I feel like. It’s a hard feeling to escape and come back from. I needed to get this off my chest. I hope I can prove myself wrong and turn my life around. There’s more to my story but it feels like I’ve wasted my prime years (16-22) dealing with drug related depression and anxiety, and failing at life because of it. Also hurting my GPA and extending my years in college because of it.

28,"So I had this friend from high school that we used to talk and hangout once in a while. She has been the longest friend that I had ever basically. 

I can't really keep friends for more than a year or couple months for a couple of reasons one of them is that every year my parents and I would move apparments because my dad didn't want to stay in one place because he didn't want the rent to go up. So his solution was to move every year and all of the friends that I had made in that area will basically be a thing in the past
Another reason is that sometime tha friends that I have they would just move on from me. Eaither they exclude me from their group or they would find someone more interesting than me I guess and move on from me. The thing that sucks is that when I would try to reach on to them some of them would act like I haven't seen them in years.

Anyways so I thought that probably something was different this time since I've had this friend for so long. It felt weird to some extend but things got complicated rencently and it made me think twice about my friend. 

So my friend got a new friend from her new job and at first I didn't have a problem with that you know you meet new people when you go to different places but when it started to bother me was when my friend would be more open to her new friend. It felt like she was a different person. So I got pretty upset about that, I thought that I wasn't ""interesting"" or ""fun"" enought to unlock that side of her so I decided to talk to her about it. I just told her that you never acted this way around me and if there was a reason why you weren't like that. Was I too boring? Was I hard to open to? Idk this was my insecurity was getting the hold of me

What I learned from that is was that my friend hates being put on the spot. She would try to change the subject or just not respond. This really pissed me off at the time and I started to bring that question again and again and again since I never got a clear answer from her until basically I turned more toxic. I told her that she dosen't care about me and that she's being a fake friend to me. 
She then she told me one day that I broke her feelings way too much and that she dosen't feel like being friends with me anymore. She said that ""I was driving us apart"" 

Now I understand that I was wrong for doing that. I just had too many emotions in me that I started being mean to my friend. It was something that was supposed to battle on my own and I didn't had to bring my friend into that.  I honestly believe that if my friend and I would've just talked then nothing would have been that heated 

Anyways couple days later she told me that she didn't wan to be my friend anymore I found out that she likes her new friend but that it's ""mutual"" between them (still when you like someone you can't fake that you don't like them). And yes I thought that it was obvious but when I asked my friend about that she just said ""that's just how I act around my friends"" and that basically put more questions in my mind. 

As of today she blocked my snapchat and phone number in which surprises me because she hasn't blocked her ex that has been texting her about them getting back to gether since the beggining of our semester in college. It just makes me think that I didn't really mean that much to her.

Have I tried apoligizing to her and given her time? Yeah obviously, but I doubt that she'll wvee talk to me again. She dosen't forgive people that easily, once she hates somebody she hates them forever. She's really reserved like that I guess. Also I tried asking her how she feels about what happened and I just fall into the same game that she was playing ealier. So yeah I don't know how she feels. She's just a husk in my mind

My friends call her an ""emotional terrorist"" because of the way she was treating me but I think they are just over reacting. I know that she did nothing wrong and I just drove away because I was an insecure little bitch. I deserve my outcome for being such an asshole. Adding to this nothing really affected to her, she still talks to her new friend like if nothing happened. She basically just erased me from her life because she just saw me as an obsticle not a friend.

But it dosen't mater anymore, I'm a piece of shit.

TL;DR: My feelings drove my friend away, now she dosen't want to talk to me.",01Dec2019,1
30,"This is something I've had stewing in my brain for awhile.

People who participate get to create their own avatar with unique powers, weapons, and skills and they fight to the virtual death in front of a paying crowd. 

This story has been developing itself inside my head for what feels like years now, and all I want to do is tell people everything about it. But... I also want them to actually be interested. I would prefer not to bore my family, friends, and girlfriend with something they'd probably lose interest in very quickly. So, I often end up just imagining scenarios to myself, playing out events, fights, and character interactions in my head.

I am kind of worried but am trying to tell myself it’s just withdraws. I think it’ll make me feel better if I turn to the people of reddit to answer me. 
I quit juuling about two days ago. I haven’t had any smoke in my lungs since then. 
I would smoke a pod a day and worked at a hookah lounge (recently left due to health issues) and did not feel good at all. Today I woke up with a sore throat, headache, nausea, heart palpitations and a low body temperature (96.4). I guess my biggest concern is the low body temperature. Is that normal?

32,"I should start to out by saying I'm a pretty relaxed person and wouldn't say I have energy that is either higher or lower than average. But I've noticed something about myself that drives me crazy. 

I have a career that I absolutely love that is pretty demanding in both the time it takes as well as mentally and emotionally. I commute an hour one way to work, so I usually spend 60-80 hours/wk on working or commuting. I just finished my masters degree, and am already anxious to find my next project. I feel like I exhaust myself by needing to keep going. I know other people who work fewer hours than me and are always saying how exhausted and spent they are. To be honest, I'm jealous of people like that. I wish I could just chill and be able to come home drained at 6pm and watch netflix until I passed out. But no. In addition to my regular job, I'm on about 3 different committees which require additional meetings and work. I go to yoga classes, cooking classes, painting classes, just to keep my mind busy. If my mind doesn't stay stimulated and run at 500 mph, I overthink and create my own problems (which I assume is my brain seeking something to do) which just result in anxiety. Even though I have a handle on it, it's frustrating and I just want to go at a slower pace. 

A couple weeks ago I got a concussion after a minor accident and it felt like a blessing to sleep so much and to be so mentally slowed down. I had hoped it would be a permanent change but I'm noticing that starting to get back to normal.

Does anyone else feel this way? Is there anything that helped you slow down?",01Dec2019,1
33,"So from years 17 to 24 I unfortunately fell into a severe depression. Half of those years I was suicidal, I dealt with severe dissociation/de-realization. I needed help bad and my parents would always say I needed to go to a therapist/doctor and I wish they would have forced me into it because I was in such a bad place that I wouldn't get help. I went once and got on an anti-depressant that made me feel completely numb and then I had a manic episode when they upped the dose. I also got into a couple toxic relationships. I let my ex come in and out of myself and basically use me for sex at his whim while he was dating other people (I realized this later, he was even cheating with me while with his current fiance). I let another guy I loved and cared about deeply to use me for sex. In the last year, I've dealt with health issues with seemingly no root cause (I'm wondering if it was just the severe mental health problems and not taking care of myself), have lost an unhealthy amount of health and dealt with a lot of physical pain that I still haven't really gotten an answer to. 

Anyways, sorry for rambling... But to the point... I graduated high school in Fall 2013 but am only just now graduating from college this Fall. I am really proud of myself. But I'm about to be 25 in January and I feel like I've lost some of my best years and I don't know how to cope with that. I don't know why 25 is so scary to me. I guess it was always my goal for having my life together at this point. I only started pulling myself out of depression this year. My twin sister has a job making $60,000.00 a year, a house, a husband, and is now having a child. She has a healthy group of friends and is genuinely happy with her life, but she also never dealt with any of the mental health issues I've had. I feel like such a mess compared to her. I haven't even been able to get out of my parents house because I've had to only work part time while in school. I just feel so behind. I just feel like now I need to rush and do all of these things that I was too depressed out of my mind to do. I feel this intense need to be in a serious relationship and get everything together and I'm terrified.

I don't know why I do this, but sometimes I like to look at gay porn, theres something about gay porn that seems way more real than straight / lesbian porn.

He took it and i told him a location of where to meet. When I saw him pulling up to the parking lot, I immediately called him and asked here he was. He said he was out on a drive. When I said yeah I know i can see that your at the parking lot he went quiet.

He told me that he knew it was me on the other side and asked why I made this whole fake profile and I told him my reason.

Reddit, I want to tell you my story and ask for your advice. It started years back, my brother and I playing a game and meeting some people in-game. Mind you they were sketched out because of the instance of the game.. It was a medieval game where you literally build a town with hard work, so losing it to some adventures was devastating. I talked to her, and because i knew what i was doing she decided to recruit my brother and I. Skip the gaming crap, we got close. Close enough for her to let me know she was actually dating the guy who ran the in-game village, and close enough to let me know she had problems in the relationship and that it was a long distance relationship with this guy. I supported her and tried to stay out of it because it really wasn't my business to intervene in their relationship. Fast forward, she tells me he treats her like crap and he has a girlfriend in real life and won't facetime her because he is scared of his GF seeing what he is doing. Automatic red flag to me and trying to not intervene i end up doing it and tell her he isn't worth her time. Fast forward again, We get attracted to each other and start our i suppose you would call a relationship. Talking on the phone and texting just about every night. Months down the road she ends up hooking up with a guy who helped us run our server and was apparently singing to her and playing his guitar behind my back, so obviously we broke up.. Year later I get in contact with her again and she is ecstatic to talk to me again and same with me. Again we start playing games together, guys are as usual hitting on her in-game.. because well.. she had quite the beautiful voice and always sounded so innocent (It's one of the reasons I was so attracted to her.) I am obviously jealous at this point and concerned after what we went through before. I ended up breaking up with her last year right before Christmas because i was scared of being hurt again. I know it hit her hard because she had just lost her mom not long before that and I hate myself for that fact. We talked briefly after that and we both agreed on missing each other, and texted each other a for a few weeks after the break up. But it seems something happened again and she refused to text me after that. Mind you guys, her and I spent hours in discord sharing songs that we both liked, relating to the songs we played. We laughed and had some really good times.

Long story, I listen to songs that remind me of her constantly.. I wanted to marry her and I loved her with every ounce of my heart. I wanted to be there for her in every moment when she cried and when she almost lost her dog. I feel like I let my head get to me and broke up with her prematurely before I actually let her get close to me. These songs that play on the radio keep getting to me and my mind just cant stop saying ""I bet she would like this song.""

I knew I wasn't going to travel. I kinda lied about it. I made plans to go hiking in west Texas on Thanksgiving and black Friday. The weather was shown to be awful so me and my buddy backed out. But, I lety family travel with out me. I did miss the food and my grandma's pumpkin pie, but I had piece of mind. 
I got house and yard work done, I got myself a few treats of a bomb pastrami sandwich for lunch and Greek for dinner. My only regret is watching Toy Story 4 by myself after a few beers, and then my dad called. After he hung up, I haven't felt this good and optimistic in a long time. 
I'm holy to carry this momentum into the plan I have. The next year is shaping up to have a really great outlook.

55,"I feel for you, strangers, I really do, but sometimes part of the problem is between your own ears.

I guess every now and then I like to be able to lend an ear or give some advice. I don't really do it that much anymore, but I like to imagine I could.

But reading longwinded emotional posts from people who have a completely faulty understanding of relationships -- who absolutely cannot understand why what they did was creepy or abusive -- that sort of thing wears on me, you know? 

Like there's probably no way that I can get through to this person that it wasn't their ""feelings"" that pushed someone away, but the way that they obsessed about them, or the way they manipulated them, or the way they cornered or embarrassed the other party.

I mean there also are the posts that are a stone's throw from word salad, where someone's imagining extreme persecution or feels like they've got the secret of the universe or isn't even coherent enough to ask a question. 

My heart aches for them. But I like to imagine those folks are usually harmless, at least. Not like the people who can't assemble any fault of their own from their stories, who will go on inflicting the same bullshit on other people time and again.

I've been that person. I've been naive, creepy, frightening, manipulative, verbally abusive. I've imagined myself the victim in situations where I was definitely not blameless. I know that it takes a harder shake than I can give someone to snap them out of it. I had to seek help.

I also spent a good few years taking care of a seriously mentally ill person who eventually became impossible to communicate with in good faith. I'm intimately familiar with the challenges people like that face and in some cases how scary the world looks to them. I wish I had words that were more kind or more meaningful. But I can't help really at all.

I just, well, I wish I could, you know?

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy activities with my friends, are capable of having deep and interesting conversations, but besides that, I feel that there is just not much to my personality.

I was really fine with it and didn't think a lot about myself until recently a girl I was dating just straight quit meeting, since she felt i was just too boring and I came to the realization that my live has literally no content except work, chilling at home and occasional meetups with friends.

I shirk my responsibilities and use video games and other media to escape from the purgatory of my own design. I've tried to get professional help but I’ve never put forth the effort to actually change. I’m a compulsive liar who lies to avoid confrontation with the problems I create. I feel like it’s too late for me to  change who I am and I know that no matter what anyone tells me it will not change my opinion. I am the worst kind of human garbage I can imagine and I don't believe I will ever change. I don’t even know why I'm bothering writing this. It will not change because I know nothing really matters. No body exists for a reason.

59,"I am Black, and a lot of people of various races seem surprised that I don't speak the traditional (or expected) Black vernacular or pronounce certain words the same as most of my Black brothers and sisters. It amuses me that I get a couple of strange looks here and there, and depending on who I'm dealing with at the time, I get the sense that I'm being looked upon as something between an oddity; an Uncle Tom or an aberration, and I've been called a couple of these terms and more, but that's OK. I made a very conscious decision to be my own man, person and individual. 

If you are Black in America, it is imperative that you wake up and begin to realize that we tend to hold ourselves back in terms of accepting the ghetto, slave or victim mentality and the subpar negative behaviors that come with them in terms of being inarticulate; using bad grammar ebonics (and writing it as well); hustling drugs and weed; accepting Baby Daddy and Baby Mama relationships as an appropriate concept for living and glorifying all this nonsense in the name of Blackness... and any Black person who dares to ""go the other way"" in terms of his or her mindset, behavior, manner of speaking or willingness to get an education is looked upon as betraying the Black race. Hear me and hear me well... THAT'S BULLSHIT! 

That said, I'm going to *""talk how I want to talk; walk how I want to walk and be who I want to be.""* I have taken this position because I have learned that I owe nothing to those who would prefer to typecast me nor do I owe anything to those who expect me to share in a certain attitude, cultural mindset, mentality or linguistic commonality just because we share the same skin. I am a Black man with a free spirit; a free, analytical, rational and objective mind, and my Blackness does not define me... I define my Blackness, and I am a revolution all by myself. So are you!

60,"Just came from a rave and danced with this incredibly beautiful woman. We danced for a good bit but because of the volume all I could really get out of her was her first name (basic meet and greet). Anyways, my buddy shot me a text to run to the side of the crowd area because he needed me for, uh, something, and the most I could do was tell her, “I’ll be right back.”

About half an hour later I went back to the general area of where we were and, unsurprisingly, she was gone. Because of the nature of the concert crowds, there was absolutely no fucking way I was going to find her again. And I never did. I kept an eye out for her on the way out of the venue but given that there were about 2000 people there my chances were slim. I just let out an empty shrug as I got into my friend’s car.

62,"Not a fan of parents who tell their kids to stop showing off. Without good reason at least. Like an oncoming car or approaching cliff edge which their child is unaware of while performing a pole dancing routine they copied off a drag queen on YouTube. 

Parents who forbid their children from expressing themselves fully because they fear other parents will think they've been teaching their kids about the virtues of boastfulness I feel kill part of the magic in being a child. Each time they blunt their kid's impulse to express, they pull them one step closer to the drab, grey predictable world they exist in and hate, precisely because it's drab, grey and predictable. 

To the kids reading this while scrolling through your mum or dad's facebook feed - ignore them. Carry on expressing yourself even if they order you to stop. Or ask them why they think you ought to. If they drop some Grade A  codswallop like, ""Because I said so"", then I'm sorry, but your parents are knobheads.

Showing off your talents, showing the world what you're capable of, isn't a crime because it may cause others to feel inadequate about what they can't do. It's they who needs to grow up. Or should that be, grow down? Obviously, don't be a knobhead yourself and refuse to share the secrets of what you're doing if someone intrigued happens to ask. You have a duty to share the good things you find out in life.

It's the adults who need to rediscover the joys of knowing and assuming nothing again. The joy of being unafraid to approach life naively. Something they may now regret having discarded because they listened to society's insistence that ""they've grown beyond that childish phase now. It no longer serves your purpose"".

64,"Years ago, I was in a really dark place: gay, closeted, never had a bf, still a virgin at 23 yo, meds abuse induced health problems (insomnia, headaches...), parents divorce, fight with siblings, moving out of home where I grew up, felt suicidal...

I thought I should go see a shrink for some help. Ended up at some crazy old bitchy hag’s place (who did not even have any form of psychological education)... Every sentence she was interrupting me and I felt so weak at the time that I could not answer back... I was always paying her cash and given that I did not go back I never got a proper chance to pay her the last session. Ever since I have felt guilty and bad for not paying her and also for not fighting her back when she was interrupting me and that I somehow fled from her rather than defending myself...

Ever since, I have always been way too scared to go back to her place and way too scared of her too and how she would treat me... (she was absolutely not empathetic and super harsh).

Years later I now have a guy in my life that I am really starting to like, who’s a sweetheart and who’s handsome and with whom I cuddle on the sofa and we have endless kissing moments and I’ve made new friends that I can share about my sexuality and who don’t judge me for who I am and I’m not a virgin anymore and I have a job that pays me loads of money. I have also been seeing another shrink who is super nice and she has helped me loads and I’ve learnt to trust and open up to people again thanks to her. Life is 90% good.

Still, there’s always this last unpaid session that bothers me and that takes up my thinking space and I would really like to live on and to turn the page over.

On the one hand she was a really bad shrink and I am positive she should be disbarred, still just because someone doesn’t do their job does not mean I can not do my part of the job, which in this case was to pay her. This is my thought process.

Do you think I should call her and ask her to pay her this last session more than 5 years later, or should I just forget about this?",01Dec2019,1
65,"A few weeks ago I targeted last Saturday as the last day I would ever touch alcohol. I wanted to quit for all the usual reasons: physical &amp; mental health, relationships, financial impact etc. that had motivated me all the previous times I tried (and obviously failed) to quit. This time is different.

Just to give you an idea of the challenge I faced, it’s recommended that the maximum number of units of alcohol a man should consume in a week is 14. I was averaging 25 – 30. A day. Every day. For years. I’m 49 and started drinking at 17 so my liver has had quite the workout over the years.

As I’ve learned from giving up smoking, dropping off the bandwagon can be used a learning experience that can eventually lead to success. “I’ll only have a few.” “I’ve earned just one drink.” Hmmm, where have I heard that before…

I chose last Saturday because I had 2 weeks off work beforehand and planned to have one last hurrah. However, I was also going to use this binge to do some “mindful” drinking (not sure that buzzword has been used in this context before) and motivate myself to quit. Among the questions I asked myself every day (read these in the voice of the drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket) were:

· “Is this how you want to feel every morning for the rest of your life?”

· “Did you say or do anything embarrassing in front of the kids last night? Oh that’s right, you don’t remember!”

· “Once again your primary objective for the day is getting it out of the way so it’s beer time again. How productive. Don’t forget to obsess if you’ve got enough in!”

· “You’re 5 beers in now - are you even enjoying this? You’re feeling creative but can’t focus enough to create anything. Again, good job!”

· “Is having your entire day revolving around alcohol really worth it for the first few drinks you actually do enjoy (which, by the way, would get any normal person a lot more buzzed)?”

Etc. etc. etc.

So Saturday night came and got lost in the fog as always and I woke up feeling my usual shit self on Sunday morning. This would be the test. Would I convince myself that I’m still technically on vacation so just one more night? Or New Year’s is only a month away so why not wait until then? Somewhat to my surprise, my self-programming seemed to have worked. I just didn’t want another night of guilty drinking, or waking up feeling shit, or getting nothing done, or any of the other of the shit I put myself and my body through daily for the sake of an hour, maybe two, of relative “enjoyment”. I was looking forward to a healthier body and mind, more time to be productive, more money - a better life in general!

So here I am a week later and that feeling of being glad to be off alcohol and excited about the future has only intensified as I’ve seen the benefits of even one week’s abstinence. No shitty mornings, coming and going without timing everything around getting the beer in, my head becoming clearer, meaningfully interacting with the kids well in to the evening and night, the insomnia that I previously used as an excuse to “have just a couple” is getting better every day and the €600ish I would have spent on alcohol next month has paid for the kids’ Christmas presents without me having to borrow any money. This extra money every month alone has reduced my stress in one of the many positive feedback loops of quitting.

I’ve continued to do my homework by constantly reminding myself of why I quit. I picture a beer and think of the time the kids woke up on Christmas morning to find “Santa” passed out on the couch, or when I hit that parked car and drove off, or when I puked so hard my whole face looked like it was bruised and then I drank some more, or when I had no idea why the kids weren’t in their room because it was a day later than I thought and they were at their mother’s. I could go on. And on and on and on.

I’ve also been working on the positive reinforcement side by reading many articles about the benefits of quitting for both mind and body. If I feel this much better after a week (writing this last week would have been impossible) I can’t wait for next week, next month, next year as my brain and body work hard to undo my fuckups (sorry guys).

I didn’t have any physical withdrawals despite the amount I drank which confirms my addiction was psychological and which is why this approach seems to have worked for me. I’ll never be able to have just one or two and I’m sure there will be times when I’m tempted (“Remember that horrible Christmas morning OP!”) but I’m 99.99% sure I’ve done it this time. I’m finally free!

Just as an addendum, a couple of days ago I came across a website which also advocates this “learning to hate alcohol” method of quitting but you don’t hear it much because it’s pretty much the opposite of the 12-step philosophy which says you’ve got a disease and all you can do is manage it for the rest of your life. Fuck that! I was the one pumping alcohol through my organs when I was drinking the same way I was the one pumping toxins in to my lungs when I was smoking. I’m still tempted to have a cigarette every now and then but, again, I remind myself of how I can’t just have one and how horrible things were when I was in even worse shape and my day revolved the next smoking opportunity. I’m all for doing whatever works for you but if I do ever pick up the bottle again as far as I’m concerned that will be my own stupid decision, not a symptom of a disease, and I’ll have the appropriate harsh words with myself. And then I’ll start again 😊",01Dec2019,1

89,"Throwaway for obvious reasons, but hear me out on this crazy love story. 

I'm currently living in an emotionally broken JW family, both my parents constantly argue about money but we're not poor - we're broke because of my dads wasteful spending. To start I should probably warn the reader that this isn't an easy read, it will be a long scroll because it's everything before, during, and to today of everything.

To begin, let me go back to the beginning. My 9th grade year of high school, I just got over my first ever relationship that was sort of ended due to my religion, she couldn't meet my family. Shamefully and full of rage, I cheated on her. There is never an excuse to cheat on someone, she may have treated me harshly but she didn't deserve that, nobody does. I was a bodybag full of hormones trying to get my dick wet any way I could, and by the end of my 9th grade year, I was heartbroken and alone, however I deserved it. I had a horrible summer of just trying anything to win her back, because I believed that mindset would work, it didn't. 

Moving into 10th grade, I decided to keep myself busy any way I could, I choose to take 2 engineering classes and yearbook, and let me emphasize how important this decision is. Yearbook is essentially the greatest decision of my life, before high school, as a JW, I wasn't allowed to join sports or have any ""worldly"" friends due to how since they're not in the religion, so I can't be friends with them outside of school. By joining yearbook, I unintentionally freed myself by having a perfect excuse to go and spend time being a yearbook photographer year round, and telling my parents it's a grade, because it was, and they allowed it. My dad drove me to football games, and to many events where I finally started to make some people I could call friends. I slowed moved on from my ex, occasionally seeing her around the school, but we talked once and came to a neutral agreement not to hate each other and not talk to each other for our own good. This is the year however I saw C. C was always hanging around the hallways after school with her abusive and controlling ex I knew, he was really controlling as a person and he gave off this fuckboy vibe I recognized too well. I never approached them after school because they would always be arguing and hitting each other in the halls, and I wanted no part to intrude on their relationship. I finished off the year a better person, and with an interest in photography. 

11th grade, Junior year was the year I thought was the best year of my life, in the very beginning, I met C by accident, I was walking to my 2nd period class on the first day of school and I ran into her. She knew my friend, and I approached her with a joke about adding me on instagram. That was the moment I knew my life had changed forever. C slowly opened up to me about her life, and how hard she has had it. Her parents were separate, but not divorced. Her dad, a police officer cheated on her sweet mother, but her mom refused to divorce him as it would make his life much harder having to support two children on child support, she made the decision that he had to move out and could see them every other weekend. I slowly fell in love with this girl, she was kind to everyone, and everyone loved her. C has such a strong determination for success, and her motivation to be a dancer by joining two clubs in her school made her one of the most determined people I have ever met. Now, half way through the year around October, we started flirting more and more, but I told her about my life, how hard it would be for me to have a relationship with her. As a PIMO JW, I told her she couldn't meet my parents as it would force them to throw me to the streets, and she had to hide our relationship from my younger brother who was a grade below me, but a grade above her. My brother and C both happened to have classes together, and they became quick friends. September 29th, the day of our local carnival, I went to take pictures of the sweethearts and I had a blast as my best friend who introduced me to C and she was there,  we were at a pause because I didn't know if I wanted to try an impossible relationship with C.I always talked with her about how our ages are only going to make things more complicated and she knew it too, but I knew the risks and she did too I was 18(I went to to school late) and she was 15. I knew the consequences, and she did too. That day, as my friend left, me and C we're alone for a moment. I went back to a metal bench inside the back of the school by the cafeteria alone, and C came back shortly after and sat with me. My heart was on fire, at that moment I loved this girl, and she had so much trust in our relationship and I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. I slipped into a corner and we had our first kiss. 

From that moment on, we considered ourselves together, I tried giving her the best relationship I could with what I had. I went to so many events driven by my parents, but really it was to spend time with her mostly, I went to so many games because she was a sweetheart and she preformed. I went to all the dance shows that were hosted at our school. Junior year was the best year of my life. 

Senior year however, was just as amazing. I finally got to meet her entire family from her amazing mother and boyfriend also her supporting daughters to her crazy father and girlfriend who lived 20 minutes away. My dad bought me a car so I could take my brother to school, and I finally started having a normal life. With my car, I was able to take C on actual food and coffee dates, I can't imagine after all this time I was missing out on something so important, actual human connection and real love for her. Every day was a gift with her, and I'll loved every moment of it. 

The summer of my graduation, I went to the pool with her, hung out around her house, and got to spend quality time with her that made me even closer with her. My first year of community college, I took on a job that was far away from my house, but on the way back from hers, so I often bought her anything she needed from the store. I would always try and go see her for an hour after my work, and I thought we had a good healthy and understanding relationship. 

After she went back into school, I started noticing she started acting differently, she would still want to go on dates and hang out, and she started becoming more and more upset with me for little things. At this point about 3 months ago, she celebrated my first birthday with me ever, she bought me a cake and we spent the entire afternoon together. I was happy.

A month ago, she because very distant after I began to notice how she stopped doing the little things she used to do. I used to call her out on her clinginess to try and stay longer when i visited her or to go see her when she knew I couldn't. I knew that she was going through something, and it only declined from there. She told me this whole time that her school was making her stress out with all her AP classes she was taking, and it became overwhelming for her to focus on both it and me. 

Now from my point of view, I thought maybe I just wasn't showing enough affection forward her, so I started doing daring things like staying out late and ignoring my parents calls when they wanted to know where I was, and I was scared for my relationship with her, she was slipping through my fingers. A month ago, she broke up with me, and I did everything I thought was right, she even told me the week we broke up that I didn't do anything wrong, but she just needed some space. I tried giving her space, but I because obsessed with her, I developed a clinginess i didn't know I could have, I loved her but she stopped showing it. One day I went to pick up my brother who was now a senior at the school, and i noticed a boy kept walking her to her car and sitting and talking with her. I saw this happen when I went and picked up my brother about two times before we broke up. I brought it up and she said I didn't have to worry. We had complete trust of each other when we were dating, and we logged into each other's insta's, and after we broke up she said she trusted me enough to say logged in, I should of logged out. When we broke up, boys constantly hit her up, and I became so jealous she stopped showing me attention and would tell them to talk to her another way I couldn't see, such as snap or texting her number. I should of logged out, I became crazy thinking about what was going on when we were broke up. 

I made some bad decisions two weeks into the breakup that damaged my trust with her, I opened up to her sisters boyfriend about something after trying to seek some help on how to be a better support to her. He have gone some good advice on why breaks are important and how I should not worry about her so much. However, later that evening as I was going back home, C called me. She said she just got off the phone with her dad, (remember a cop) about how I was trying to retaliate against her from our breakup. She was in tears and she continued calling me when I was trying to figure out what to do. Without telling anyone, I got into my car and drove to meet her mom who was confused about the whole situation at a local store around 9ish pm. I explained everything to her and she helped me calm down her crazy dad, who I don't blame for acting the way he did, but he threatened me with some pretty crazy things. I kept my cool and we resolved the situation, but I knew I had crossed a boundary I couldn't go back on, I damaged C's trust in me forever and after our breakup too. 

After that crazy week, I thought we were on good terms, but C started becoming more and more upset when we texted, and she started leaving me on open or just straight up ignoring me sometimes. 

We had good nights and we had bad nights. One night about a week ago, we met up to talk and we kissed for the first time in weeks, it was so passionate and fulfilling, I thought I might have her back by then. I was wrong. 

This next part is what made me realize what had been going on, and I realized there was nothing I could do without a huge retaliation. 

I muted her stories because I didn't want to see who or what she was talking to during our breakup, and she told me a week ago that she wasn't talking to anyone. Two days ago I unblocked her story and she posted a video of the caption reading.. ""Rare time caught on film with this cutie ❤️"" It was the guy who walked her to her car in the very beginning. 

Now here's the most important part of this all. I wrote down how I thought this situation was happening, she started being friends with this guy from the beginning, and when I couldn't be there for her, he was, supporting her. I thought about it for a long time. I finally wrote down everything and I had my thoughts collected.

But last night C finally told me why she was so drained of our relationship we had, it wasn't because I was being a bad boyfriend, it was because she started feeling like since she couldn't meet my parents because of me being a JW, she said she felt like we never advanced in our relationship. When she told me this, I was torn, she understood from the very beginning that she could never do that while I lived with them unless I wanted to become homeless, but I understood why she broke up with me, and it wasn't fair. She also told me that a week before we broke up, she started loosing feeling for me, and after we broke up she lost all feelings for me.

Let me explain, both her sisters have boyfriend with similar situations, for example her oldest sister goes to a school three hours away and only comes back for holidays or when she doesn't have too much work to do. Her boyfriend drives down there for her sometimes too, and they have a strong relationship built on trust and they love each other. The guy has probably one of the harshest lives i've ever known for someone at 19 years old, he works two jobs, goes to school, and lives on his own because his dad hates him and his mom isn't in his life. He has a hard life, and he has it way harder than I do but both of them make it work. 

When C told me she couldn't meet my parents, and our relationship felt like it was at a stop, she knew she had plenty of guys who could give her a normal relationship vs me. I was lead on for a month believing I could get her back, when this whole time she knew it wouldn't happen because our situation was tough. 

Yesterday, I woke up at 6 on a Saturday abnormally, I haven't been sleeping very well due to all of this. My family hosts a weekly field service meeting at our house, and I helped my mom clean before I left to the mall to return something I bought on black friday. What she didn't know was I was going to make the biggest decision of my life yesterday, I was going to talk to C and tell her if she'd be willing to try again, I would take the next step with her and introduce her to my strongly faithful JW parents. I went to the mall and called my best friend who introduced me to her in the first place, and she said I was courageous for trying to do that for her. I texted C and waited 6 hours to be left on open. I went from the mall to coffee shop waiting for a response, and out of the blue around 6pm, her older sister (I'll call her H) invited me to the first friendsgiving I have ever been to. There I saw her H and C's other sister T. I hung out with them for 3 hours and I had a epiphany. I didn't realize my worth when C basically abandoned me, I was so dependent on her for love because I had nobody else. When I met with H's friends and T, I realized that I was worth more than just waiting for C back. She lead me on for a month, and didn't even want to try and have me back. I wrote down everything I wanted to say to her on a few pages of my notebook, and I was supposed to go and tell C about them until I got invited to the party. After I had probably the funnest night of my life hanging out with really cool people, I realized my worth. I takes with H after the party alone, and she opened up to me about her previous 3 year relationship with someone who ditched her and cheated on her the second he got a chance. She told me I was worth more, and for the first time in a few weeks, I believed it. I removed C from all my social media, and I gave H two of the photos I carried of her in my wallet. I ripped out the pages from my journal of the plans that I was supposed to tell C but never could because she ignored me, and told her to give them to her along with the photos. Shortly after I arrived home feeling better then I have in weeks. I had real friends I could confide in, and I didn't deserve to be left how she did.

95,"I’m 23 yrs old. The standard advice for making friends is to share time/experiences with people. I’ve done all that. I have acquaintances at work and a sport that I play. I can listen to people, quick with humor, etc. I get invited to occasional get-togethers. 

I don’t consider any of these people my friends because I don’t connect or feel like we get each other. In fact the longer I know someone, the more distant I feel from that person, even if I think they’re great. Small talk is only enjoyable to a certain point so I don’t desire to hang out with anyone I know. I’ve forced myself into social situations but a typical scenario is accepting invite, painfully regretting my decision, then flaking.  If I do go, strong chance of wishing I hadn’t and dipping early. 

I want to have someone that I do connect with but maybe I just inherently can’t? I’ve met so many different people in my life so maybe my personality is such that I can’t form friendships more than surface-level politeness?

97,"To my best friend in the whole world.

I want you to know that you are loved. Today is the first day we haven’t talked, but it feels like weeks. I know that you need your space right now. I know that things have been hard. And I want to give you your space but I worry about you every second. It’s taking everything in me not to drive to your house. Not to call you on the phone. I know you won’t pick up and I know you won’t answer the door but I just wish I could tell you how much I care. And how much you mean to me.

I know you haven’t been sleeping. I know you’ve been alone. I know there are times you think about giving up. But please don’t. You are so important to me and I don’t know what I would do without you. You were there for me in my darkest times. You pulled me out of my worst moments. You’re the only reason I’m still on this planet today. I would be gone without you. I just wish I could be there and do the same for you. 

I told you I’m always here. I told you I love you. But I don’t know if you believed me. I understand if it’s hard right now. You don’t know why your brain is making you feel this way. But it will get better. I hope you know that. And I hope you see this and are reminded that you are loved. That you are perfect. That this world would be a million times worse without you in it. That I would not be able to keep going without you. You have so many reasons to be happy, yet I know that sometimes it’s still not enough.

I will give you your space. I will let you be alone if that’s what you need. Just know I will miss you smile. And your laugh. And your sarcastic jokes. And the nights where we stay up until 6am watching movies and drinking wine and playing board games. I hope this isn’t forever. I hope that you will come back to me and allow me back into your life. Just know I will be waiting for that day. Whether it’s a week or years. I will always be here. And you will always be my favorite person in the world. 

I’m sitting in my car writing this and crying. I’ve been crying all day. Not for myself but for you. I wish I could make your pain go away. I wish I could help you sleep. I wish I could help you love yourself. You are such a wonderful, funny, bright person and you deserve so much more than you were given. You deserve happiness. You deserve friends. You deserve whatever your heart desires in this world. If only you saw in yourself what I see. If only you loved yourself the way that I love you.

But if you see this, you don’t have to reply. You don’t have to text me. You don’t have to call me. As much as I wish you would, I don’t expect you to. But please know that you are loved. And I will always be here. Always.",01Dec2019,1

I consider myself pretty level-headed and I understand that this is just “one of those things.” I’m in the part of life where I have to figure myself out, find who I am, my likes, dislikes, desires, better myself for myself, etc... I thoroughly understand that I have to enjoy this season and that things will unfold when they have to. I can rationalize everything but the longing is still very present.

Did anyone feel this way and is now married with kids or w/o kids but with a partner? Do you have any recommendations/suggestions on how to deal with this?

Please don’t just say “enjoy this time” because I definitely have.

TL;DR I want babies and a partner but won’t happen for a couple years. It is what is is, it’s not keeping me from enjoying “the present”. But can’t stop the longing, it hurts sometimes.",01Dec2019,1
106,"It just seems like I always make the wrong decision in whatever I do. I had the chance to have a great friend group at a university I was comfortable being at, but nope. I messed that up by getting shit grades, being lazy, and smoking weed/dabs all day. I had a chance to show mad confidence to a girl I liked at this concert, but nope. I did not initiate contact and interest declined between us after that night. Being 22, I’m probably at my lowest mental point in my life. I’m going to university again but it’s not the same as when I first went.

I have no friends, maybe acquaintances, but no one I could call a friend. It just seems at this new college, I have found no one I mesh with. I try to make friends but no one wants to do anything outside of class. No one really cares about me besides my family so that also stings. The only two things I have to hold onto in this world are fitness and music. In a nutshell, I just hate who I’ve become and where I’m at mentally. I just sit in my dorm, smoke dabs all day and do no school work. Having no one for years and years has started to take a toll on me mentally. Personally, I don’t think I deserve anything like friends, or a girlfriend because of my actions. I think I’m destined to feel like this for my life and I think I have to accept it. I think I was given that one chance my freshman year and I blew that opportunity. Living with this empty feeling is now punishment and I guess that’s life. Any methods to cope with this besides drugs or fitness? I don’t think THC or weights are helping and I’m wondering if I should even be here anymore. I don’t really have a place here.",01Dec2019,1
