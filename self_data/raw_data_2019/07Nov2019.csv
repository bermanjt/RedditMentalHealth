0,"I'm feel like I'm going through an early life crisis. So I cant pinpoint when it started but for the past couple of week's or so i've been doing a lot of research into high sucessful academics, prodigies and Innovator's and its held up a mirror that's forced me to confront my incompetence. 

I've always been strongly academically inclined with a heavy emphasis on maths and STEM subjects, top sets at a selective school, highly praised by teachers etc. On top of this outside of football i've never particularly excelled at any sport and while there's nothing wrong me I'm not the most outgoing person. This had meant that my academic prowess has become deeply ingrained in my indentity and I have now realised is the major component of my self esteem and self worth

 But reading about people who went to university at 12, winning international maths competitions at 14, getting Phd's at 21. Its really put into perspective just have far I am from where I saw myself and put a strict limit on my potential, how can I even think I could compete or follow in the footsteps the likes of Terrence Tao.  Unfortunately this has happened to coincide with my first few weeks of university and it's really affecting my studies. Everytime I get stuck on a question for even a few minutes I think of how some 10 year old genius could have done this already and how being stuck on this question means I'm an just not good enough and it's causing a lot of counterproductive stress. 

During school I always coasted by and I made a promise to myself to try hard this year and it was working. I had started to rekindle my love of learning that I lost when I entered secondary school, I was reading a lot and doing well on my course work as well as doing professional applications and I was having a lot if fun. 

But now I start working and then think of geniuses like Gauss and Edward Witten and think what's the point, there's no chance I will ever match up. So many people have done amazing things by my age such as collaborting with NASA or putting forward mathematical proofs and research. Its partly dispair at my own lack of curiosity over the years that mean't I never pushed myself to be more and now I think it might be too little too late, adolescence is when the brain learns quickest.

 What do you when you fail by the one yardstick you've always measured yourself by. Does anyone else ever feel this way or have any advice?",07Nov2019,1
1,"I want to start by saying that I'm 18 and I don't really think I have any weird interests, and I don't think my appearance is bad or creepy at all. I like basketball, video games, TV, pizza you know ""normal"" stuff right? But I still feel weird, and I feel like everyone thinks I am too. I think it's my social skills, I don't feel like I have any disorder I'm just maybe bad with people.

Sometimes when I talk to people they dodge eye contact with me or get a worried/anxious look in their eyes when talking to me. I have no idea what to do, I feel happy and not that anxious a lot of the time. It just pisses me off because i feel like there's a really awesome social person under all of this bad social skills.",07Nov2019,1
2,"For most of my life I drifted by and let myself flow down the river to see where it takes me. Never have I minded for the longest time whether or not someone chose the direction for me.

I lost a lot of sense of self living this way and had doubts for what I would become having someone else live my life for me.

Today, I stopped a majority of my habits and stopped aligning myself to go along with someone else because they want me to. I take part in my hobbies that grant me satisfaction and chose the path that's right for me.

Now, after a long time, I feel great, better than I ever have before.",07Nov2019,7
3," Im going through a phase right now where things just seem to be going right and that there is hope for the future. Often times I admittedly feel like everything is going wrong, but right now, things are good. Yesterday, in math class, my teacher announced that for math IB, there are actually two streams of math and neither is less 'respectable' than the other, but one of them is a little bit more statistic based where as the more common stream is more calculation based. As someone who has wanted to go into psychology for many years now, I've obviously been trying to do really well in school, but it's hard sometimes. It's hard to find the motivation to do the assignments at home, it's hard to keep up when we have to go home and learn. But so, this alternate math course would be the IB equivalent of the -2 option, but in second semester of graded 11, we would get our 30-1 math credit. I'm just happy and relieved right now to know that there is a course for me out there, and that maybe I do have hope with getting into my dream program at my dream university. (I'm sorry that this is formatted so weirdly, I was just sort of writing word for word my stream of thought, which is sort of all over the place.)",07Nov2019,1
4,"My wife is pregnant and spent a long weekend out of town for work. I was just looking at bullshit on the internet Friday after work when I came across this female DJ who was playing a live set that night in the city. Turns out this lady plays like 10 instruments and creates all her music live. I'm a sucker for live sets with instruments so I watched a couple videos and was digging her vibe. I also had some old molly that wasn't going to be used in the foreseeable future so I said what the hell and decided to go. Back in my single days I would go to concerts and festivals pretty regularly, but I don't really keep in touch with those friends now that I'm a married man so I just went by myself. I'd never gone to a show by myself, but I have no problems doing things by myself so didn't think much of it. I was mostly excited to just roll with an artist that I appreciated and dance with no inhibitions because no one there would know me. My wife is not as into electronic music as I was so it's been years since I've been to an electronic show too--these shows usually have the nicest, most welcoming crowds.

So I get to the venue, get a drink, and go up to the railing on the second level that overlooks the DJ and stage to chill and take in the scene while the openers are up. After a while two girls end up standing next to me on the rail. It's the day after Halloween so there are decorations up and some people are in costume. These two girls had little cat ear headband things on and one was playing with the spiderweb hanging off the rail, so I leaned over and said I liked how into her costume she was, playing with string like a kitten. They both laughed and we talked about Halloween decorations and small talk bullshit. The girl next to me was wearing a full black bodysuit that she cut up so it was kinda catwoman-ish. She was a fit petite Asian and it looked great on her, so I told her. They asked me what my costume was, I told them I was acting sober. Her friend was hyping up her crafting skills and she seemed flattered so she grabbed my hands and ran them up and down her sides so I could feel the texture. The molly was hitting my system so the fabric and her skin felt amazing. The opener finished and the crowd started shifting over to the main stage. The girls asked if I wanted to go down to the dance floor with them. I said yes and we all held hands as they led me down.

We get to the floor and they start peppering me with questions. How old am I, where am I from, where do I live, what do I do...we are all in our early thirties so I understand their curiosity and answer as vaguely as possible because I'm starting to get paranoid. What if they find me online and see that I'm married and ruin my life? Margaret is the Asian, and although I'm really starting to roll and it's getting hard to focus, I can see that she's gorgeous. Her friend is Kat, and she's a skinny blonde girl in a leopard-y print top and leather short skirt. Also pretty, but I really clicked with Margaret. I am my own harshest critic but I am closer to satisfying internet rules #1 &amp; #2 than not. I suppose after this night I have good reason to embrace my own attractiveness.

At this point I've answered most of their questions and the DJ had started. Margaret asked me something else and I asked her how long the application to dance with her was, was I almost done? I forget what she said to that but I remember the next part perfectly. I said I didn't want to talk anymore, I just wanted to dance with her. She just said ok, jumped in front of me, and pressed her tight body back against mine and started grooving. I had forgotten how good that felt. Now we're dancing against each other, and she takes my hands and runs them all over her body. It's getting hot and we just started. I am rolling and high and enjoying the moment.

Then Kat comes over, takes a mint out of her mouth, puts it in Margaret's, and looks at me. I am shocked and ask if there's anything else that they like to share. She laughs, grabs Margaret, and then start making out while I dance with her! This is when I lose my shit and feel like none of this is real. I put my hand behind Kat's head and steer her to me and then we're making out, then I'm kissing Margaret, then they're back together kissing and dancing while Margaret is between me and Kat. Kat takes my hands and puts them on her ass so I'm feeling her and dancing on Margaret and life is good. The three of us basically spend the next hour and a half grinding, groping, and kissing. It felt like a movie. I'd have Margaret on one leg and Kat on the other, rubbing themselves against me while I touched all over them. They had come with two gay guys who were nearby the whole time. A couple times I heard them talking to people around us like, yes I can't believe this is happening either; yes, this fucking guy right; yes, some people have all the luck. At the risk of sounding self-centered, looking back it seems like we were super hot, people around us definitely noticed and were talking about it, mostly giving me props for living a guys dreams. Pretty sure I got shoved harder than necessary a couple times too but oh well some people just suck.

This whole time my wedding ring has been on my finger, but we have all been too into it to notice. The girls are both rolling, and had coke. They both said they're chronically single and Margaret hadn't been out in a month, so I'd like to think they were fully enjoying themselves too. Kat kept saying what a good kisser I was. Margaret kept grabbing and massaging my crotch. As the DJ finished, I still couldn't believe what had happened. I'd only danced with random girls a couple of times, rarely with one as sexy as Margaret, and definitely never two at the same time. I honestly hadn't thought beyond 'this is great wowowowowow', but then they asked if I wanted to go to another club with them. I immediately said yes. As we head out I heard Margaret ask Kat if she had condoms.

We get outside and start walking to the next club. I had driven to the club and we passed by my car on the other side of the street. I saw two crackheads standing by the passenger door about to smoke a pipe. I start to get paranoid about my car -- it's like 2:30am, this is a sketchy part of the city and I really didn't want anything to happen to the car. This paranoia starts to take over. The girls are walking together in front of me, it seems like looking at their phone together. They look back at me, then back at the phone and my paranoia takes it up another notch. I convince myself they've found me online. So now I'm sure these girls know who I am, and that a crackhead's going to break into my car and take a shit in it (has happened to too many friends to count). We get to the second club and as the girls and gay guys are going thru security, I just turned around and quickly walked away without a word or look back. My car was only a couple blocks away so after I turned the corner I start running to it. I hop in, drive home, and then spend the next three hours unable to sleep, reliving the glorious concert and torturing myself with the inglorious ending.

I realized I did not want to have sex with these girls or go home with them, but I did want to keep dancing. Don't get me wrong, I am very interested in having a threesome, but I just didn't feel the same urge to act on that as I did to just dance with them. I think part of it was my own guilt -- going to a concert and happening to dance with these girls seems like it's on a different level than going home with them (even though this would have been incredible). Part of it was weird 'empathy' I had where I felt like they were really into me (especially Margaret) and I felt bad that I couldn't give them the relationship they were looking for. I know if I had an encounter and connection like that I would want more. That's partly why I'm writing this post. I have been unable to stop thinking about meeting and leaving these girls. Unable to stop cursing my stupidity from literally walking away from two hot girls who just wanted to dance, do drugs, and be with me, and patting myself on the back for being in that position in the first place. I've been looking extra closely at petite Asians and skinny blondes ever since in the hopes of recognition, but I actually don't know what I would say if I saw them again. This was the best show of my life (the DJ was amazing too), but also the biggest regret. But how blessed am I that my biggest regret is not hooking up more with two girls at the same time?!?? Fuck me, right.

In the end, this definitely increased my self confidence. My beautiful and amazing wife tells me I am attractive, but I usually brush it off with that kind of squeamish 'oh this is what I want to hear but also don't look at me and say nice things' feeling. We've been married for almost 10 years, so getting non-wife approval was unusual but very much appreciated. It made me think how I would feel if our roles were reversed -- what if my wife went to a show and made out with two guys?! I'm sure she could if she wanted to. But overall, and as weird as it sounds, this whole thing has made me appreciate her more. She really is my perfect partner, because we've had concerts like this where we are dancing and so into each other that other people start staring. But she also gives me everything else besides this fun.

So Kat and Margaret, thank you both for the amazing memories (I've been trying to commit as much of the hazy night to memory as possible). You are both smart and sexy and I truly hope you both find partners that make you feel as good as my wife does for me. I'm sorry I ran away like I did, but I think it was in my best interests to (I hope the what-if of the rest of the night doesn't eat away at me forever...). And to my wife - I love you!",07Nov2019,0

15,"TLDR: I tried painkillers and all they did was make me super productive without any nasty side effects. I didn’t get addicted. Anyone else got similar experiences? 


My mom had a surgery to which she received 30 pills of Vicodin (hydrocodone) and 30 pills of Dilaudid (hydromorphone). She switched to Dilaudid because the Vicodin gave her bad side effects. She only took like 2 of those when she had pain and maybe 4 of the Dilaudid so there were some leftover. Ngl, I kinda hate my mom she always stresses me out and asks me to do stuff constantly when she could easily do them herself. She gets incredible mood swings and is just sometimes to much to handle. Say about a year and half ago I discovered alcohol which helped me cope with all of her yelling since I was kinda too tipsy to notice. I only live with my mom and she an overzealous catholic woman who would murder me if she found out I drank but I got the alcohol because occasionally she would receive it as gifts but just leave it or disregard it. Then I stole it and eventually drank everything up and I didn’t know how to get more. I mean it was actually fine though I’m not an alcoholic or anything and I did very well for the 4 months I didn’t have access, only wishing I could drink some when my mom began to yell. So fast forward then she had these pills from her surgery and out of curiosity I wanted to see how they felt, knowing that yes opioids are extremely addictive. First, I did my research only on Vicodin because those were the only ones I was planning on taking.  I read that it can make you nauseous, dizzy, lightheaded, etc. Then I looked up how many to get you high, about 20-30 mg for the first time will do the trick and those pills were 10 mg each. I took 3 and didn’t feel anything then I took 3 more and proceeded to violently through up the whole night and the next day and still wasn’t recovered even two days after. Once that was all said and done I swore off them, trust me it feels like shit and I did not want anything to do with them. But then as my mom progressively recovered from her surgery she started yelling and me to do more things and was always a bitch to me and I couldn’t take it so I decided to take the Vicodin again, but only 2 this time (hey, it’s better than going back to self-harming). The effects weren’t too bad just small waves of nausea every now and then and honestly it did help me cope with all the stress of my mom. I didn’t really experience this euphoric high and was still able to function. This was my new answer. I lasted on about 20 pills taking two for each dose which lasted me 2 months, I wasn’t taking it everything and didn’t need it to function because again: not addicted. I ran out and decided to take my mom’s Dilaudid (she wasn’t using them and honestly forgot about them). I took three 2mg pills the first and again threw up a bit but definitely not the same as the Vicodin. As time went on all negative side effects seemed to vanish and let me tell you what happened. THOSE PILLS WERE A GODSEND. I became so productive every time I took them and became super motivated to clean and do my homework and literally anything I just wanted to be extremely productive. So instead of taking them to deal with my mom I took them to make myself smart basically. I would take them before a long night of homework or even take them before tests to which I would proceed to absolutely dominate. I never got high from them, never got disoriented or anything of the bad side effects. They seriously helped me get my life on task. Then I ran out before a huge night of work and essays to do. I had already ran out and had a mini mini mini panic attack and ultimately I didn’t do any of my work and do I wish I still had the painkillers? Yeah but ultimately it’s been a couple of weeks and I’m fine without them. My productivity has decreased and I find I’m lacking motivation to do any work but hey it is what it is. Has anyone else had similar experiences or any advice???

16,"I wasn’t allowed to be at the award ceremony.

I spent the last two years building this amazing community health program that I am so, so, so proud of. I have been tearing my hair out, stressed to the max the whole time, mostly because of a really toxic boss. She finally drove me to resign in August. Two days after my resignation, we were selected as a finalist for a really big award. The kind of award I had been working towards my whole career.

Tonight was the award ceremony and I was not allowed by my former boss to attend. She got my name taken off of all the award materials. She was really angry and spiteful after I resigned and has done everything she could to drag my name through the mud after I resigned.

I’m really heartbroken. All of that hard work and I’m not allowed to celebrate it. All because this hideously spiteful woman was mad I left her team. I have never poured that much passion into anything. I felt like I had found my calling.

17,"I started a reddit account partially out of desperation, partly out of a genuine want for connection with anyone.

I’m putting up front I’m trying to reach out to friends and making plans and know people have it much worse/better and a lot of this may just be in my head- but it doesn’t make it less real. So here is a quick story.

Terrible childhood.
Mother suffered from schizophrenia. Smoked until the day I watched her die.
Father was incredibly abusive- to the point where I was hospitalized several times from injuries. Children services called blah blah.
Rebellious teen- never did drugs never went to jail- so not that rebellious. 

Politely asked to withdraw from classes after columbine- which was more of a demand. 
Got an equivalency- I was the kid who aced all the tests but never did homework due to terrible home life-anyway-
Did ok- went to college and won a bunch of awards for film and other things. was dirt poor.

Fast forward- I’m in my 30s and working at a tv station. It’s steady, underpaid and really pretty easy for what I was doing. 

End up being one of those that makes more on YouTube than a ‘real job’ - quit tv and do the YouTube thing- pays all my bills and way more in line with salary and it’s kinda cool.
Lonely. 

Sometimes the only person I talk to in a couple days is the cashier at the coffeehouse for lunch (stopped all caffeine about 1 year ago)

Work my ASS off- get a decent following. 

I ended up moving away from all my friends. 
Been trying to make friends in my mid 30s in the Midwest is way hard. 
I still don’t know how to do this.

I’m so crushingly lonely- feel totally out of touch with the world around me- and now I also feel like my entire career isn’t something I want to do anymore. 
I’m not going to make it in Hollywood- I’m not delusional.

TV is dying- and people ain’t hiring dudes near 40 to work any amazon or Netflix productions when they can pay a 20 something half and work them to the bone (been there done that)

And now I’m wondering how to start over. 
How do you make friends (that aren’t just drinking) how do you keep going? How do you reinvent yourself when you feel like everything you know is disintegrating in front of you. 

Fear I’m getting sick like my mom, feeling like a failure, when this is what I dreamed of. I made my own way, and now I’m tired, alone and panting, exhausted from ‘the path not traveled’

I feel like I’m dying- or dead already. 
I have my fiancé, and I love her with my entire heart. I’m looking forward to the wedding.
But damn- I don’t know where I’m going to be at 50 or 60! People do t go out anymore.
People don’t even talk anymore. 
I think I’m pretty likable- I still have friends back home, but not where I am. 
I just have my camera, my small studio, and my fiancé. Why do I feel so empty? 

My gut is telling me to walk away from all things video- but what do you do when you walk away from your life’s work?

I‘ve been suicidal but I wouldn’t ever do it. I couldn’t do that to my partner. But every day feels like I’m in a dystopian nightmare.

What would you do? 
How do you meet friends?
How do you deal with getting older and feeling obsolete?",07Nov2019,4

19,"My family and I were on vacation I slept in the other half of the hotel room with my 2 brothers and my parents in the other half. It was like 2 hotel rooms with part of the wall in between them gone. In our ‘room’ there was a queen sized bed next to the window and hotel room entrance door and my twin bed at the far side. Also we are on the 3rd floor with the hallway being just a long railed path looking down into the parking lot if that makes sense. 

I woke up to the hotel door rattling and tbh since I went to bed before everyone I thought everyone was still up. It persisted and I thought my brothers were just messing around. I still had my eyes shut facing the wall and thought to myself, if they don’t stop then I’m screaming at them, they do it again. I flip over angrily, it’s dark but light from the street is still lighting up the room, there I see my little brother (9?) trying to open the door. “What are you doing?” He doesn’t answer. “It’s late get back to bed” He walks back to bed and says in a tired/annoyed voice “Nothing!” And then goes back to sleep. Everyone is still asleep and I get up to check my phone that is charging in front of the door, it was either 12 or 3 am I can’t really remember. 

The next morning I tell him about this and he remembers nothing. My mom also says that’s when he usually walks into her room. I can’t imagine what could’ve happened if I hadn’t woken up and he actually got the door open. I’m also not a hundred percent sure if this actually happened or if I just dreamt it all. Another weird thing is that we both are weird like that, I used to sleep walk a lot. Instead of going to my moms room I’d go to the living room because that’s where she normally was at night. I stopped sleep walking when I got a bunk bed. 

Anyways weird story that I felt like sharing. Do you guys have any weird sleep walking incidents or just things you swore were true but might have dreamt them?",07Nov2019,1

24,"I am going down a deep hole at the moment. I skipped my therapy appointment last week and she hasn’t called to check up. I know that in the very end, it’s my own responsibility to fix myself, that I am tired of saying the same things over and over again. I really can’t have any change unless I make the effort but I truly don’t care enough about myself to even try at this point. It was my own responsibility to show up and I didn’t. I don’t know how to reconcile it now, it’s been about a week. I thought I was okay without it but I don’t know if I am.. My 2 best and really only friends moved to New York City recently. I could’ve gone with them but I turned it down and now I’m stuck by myself in the same town I grew up in, feeling as if I am rotting from the inside out. Now they’re making memories and their lives are moving on without me. They’re growing and becoming better human beings and I’m just here. Too afraid to move. Too much of a coward to make a change, to chance my life and challenge myself and least TRY to do something remarkable. I am stuck in the sickly depressive comfort of my dull life even when I know I hate it here. I feel very very stuck in my life. I have a dead end job, no college degree, I haven’t had an S/O in almost 4 years. I’m 23 and although I live on my own, I can barely afford it. I don’t know where to go and I don’t know why I stay. There’s a constant question running through my brain saying “why don’t you try to be more?”. I have gotten so comfortable in my isolation and sadness that I really don’t know how to get out.

26,"Ever since since I've started High School, I've been friends with this one kid, let's call him Tom. Tom is socially awkward, so me bring his friends means a lot to him, and I've been working  with him to come out of his shell which he has. The problem is all of his hobbies are mine, but him being there makes it worse for me. I know this sounds bad but let me explain. I started playing super smash bros. competitively and now he wants to too. This wouldn't be a problem except he doesn't actually practice at all, just plays with me and has no sense of when I'd rather be playing by myself. So suddenly my practice session has been turned into a lesson where Tom won't end up taking any of the advice.

Next we got Tennis. Same story, I get invested years earlier then he joins the team and has no sense of when I'm trying to improve and has me become a glorified coach because I can never say no. I'm practicing with my other friends of equally skill? Now I've got to work on his serve for the next 45 minutes. The entire time I'm saying how he needs a professional coach, not an amateur player, but he always brushes it off (His family is very well off so affording a coach is not an issue). Then I sign up for my own lessons, now he suddenly gets lessons too with me and can't seem to understand I'm trying to work on my game not have a conversation

At school, I always feel super bad because I'm always trying to avoid him because the second he sees me he's next to me until classes start. Suddenly I can't talk to my other friends, or just go anywhere by myself. This lasts about a half hour too. Tom's lack of social skills means if sees me talking to someone else, he'll just walk up and start a conversation to the bewilderment of my other friends. That, at least, is something I have been able to work on him on by just holding up a finger until my previous conversation is done. 

Finally, I'm talking to a girl, and we're pseudo-dating at this point but I haven't told him, so any time I try to talk to her after school I can't because he's following me around, walking out the doors with me. IDK, mabye I'm a bad friend, but it's just getting really frustrating to deal with, and I know he would stop immediately if I ever told him to stop, I just can't because I'd feel so bad, and I'm really his only friend. Mabye someday Tom will come out of his shell but until then I'm constantly feeling guilty and frustrated over his clingyness.",07Nov2019,0
27,"You know that smell if you get a towel wet and leave in wadded up in a corner for a week? That's mildew, a harmless(?) but smelly bacteria.

But here's the thing. I can smell this long before anyone else I know can. One of my coworkers smells like mildew every day and I can't get within 5 feet of him without gagging. I suspect his washing machine is a mildew incubator.

31,"I live in a metropolitan area where in order to afford even a cheap one bedroom apartment I'd need to be making a minimum of $17/hour. I went through a pointless three years of college for a skills trade certificate in CNC Machining and coding, and my boss refuses to pay me more than $14/hour. After calculating out all of my expenses, even if I worked 40 hours a week, I still can't afford even the cheapest studio apartment. I'm 23, living at my parents, and I feel like a failure. No matter how hard I work, it just won't ever be enough. 
Last month I let that sink in. I admitted defeat. Until I get a higher wage, nothing will ever change. 
So I decided instead of spending all my hours wasting my time at a factory that doesn't appreciate my labor, I cut the hours back. Just one day a week I scheduled myself to leave at noon. Today was the first day I did. Today was also the most productive day I've had in months; I organized my room, I sorted through old clothes that don't fit anymore, I even went to the gym and had one of the best workouts I've had in MONTHS. I 3D printed a fixture to hang my jewelry on, and even caught up on some reading. I sat down and practiced the piano, which I never do anymore, and it made me so happy. All of it made me so happy. Next week I think I'll paint and write more of my next book. 
My parents resent me for it. They belittle me, they say I have debt to catch up on (despite the fact I'm still paying the same amount as I always have towards it), they make snide comments that I'm not a hard worker... all because I cut back a flimsy four hours of my work week. They don't listen when I try to explain it to them; they don't understand the price of living anymore. But honestly, until I get a raise, it doesn't matter what they think; infact it doesn't matter what I think either. Yeah, I'm defeated, but having this little extra break to fulfill my soul? It makes up for it. Maybe something will sprout from it, if nothing else but a little extra peace of mind.",07Nov2019,3

36,"I have had plenty of periods in my life where people are dying and I am spending the last few days with them.  Whether it is family members, friends, or my beloved pets.  I spend several days, weeks, months with them. Maybe only sleeping for a few hours. Those periods seem as though they last forever compared to times of everything going well and are the closest thing we experience to truth.

In the time leading up to the final moments, it feels like my life as I know it has reached its end, but in and among the chaos you can feel life continuing on.  Your life is in agony, but everyone else is unaffected.  


You tell yourself you will do things differently, live your life differently, treat yourself and people better.  A few weeks or months later, you are back to your regular self as the clock continues to count down.

I know one day, more-so now than ever as I am in my mid 30's, that it will happen to each and every person, pet and loved one that I have in my life unless I am the one to go first.   Perhaps this is why so many older people are so cold or removed from love and optimism. 

Days, weeks and months go by faster now than they ever have.   I continue to preoccupy myself with irrelevant things.  Video games, gossiping, negativity, social media, reddit, political news or propaganda, porn.

it's as if we are in a matrix that reinforces this way of thinking, seeing and believing.

What am I to do instead? 

Sit around with everyone, weirding them out as I hold onto the sentimentality they have in my life?  Then what and for how long?  


As I tuck the love of my life into bed as another day finds its end, my heart sinks a little more than the day prior as I know one day we will be leaving each other for good and not because we broke up, hate each other, or wronged each other - but because the natural process of dying that we pretend doesn't exist has found its way to our doorstep.

Am I doing enough?  Of course I am, but it seems as though I need to somehow surrender even more to our union.  


Everything in my life is so scared because it is my life.  Each minute, every kiss, every meal, every time I interface with reality in a subjective experience because it's temporary but I haven't figured out how to show it that sacredness.

Today I am 35.  Tomorrow I will be 80 wondering where the time went.

I was sleeping, but I could swear I was awake, everything felt as though I was awake. 

For whatever reason I was sleeping on my side, but my knees were up, almost touching my chest... an almost fetal position.

I remember it so vividly. A very short, white/blurry humanoid figure with no features at all slowly crept around the corner my eyes were trained on.

My heart began pounding, and as it approached, I tried so hard to move my body - i wanted to swing at it so bad. I couldn't. I just watched wide-eyed, only able to get my body to twitch, as it kept getting closer to me. 

Then with quick laboured, deep breath, I shot my body up, ready to punch something.

Nothing was there, I was awake. For real this time. My heart was pounding.

After checking around the corner, and the bathroom I went back to sleep.

46," So I just hit a deer and I'm trying to bring my nerves back down from space at the moment; I'm on Mars.(edited)I'm going at least 60 miles an hour and I tried to stop when I saw this deer on the side of the road and I couldn't slow down fast enough; I hit the deer at the same time as I am skidding my tires on the pavement and the deer went flying off to the right. Right now I am trying my hardest to not let my anxiety go through the roof because part of me is actually laughing at the fact that how far the deer actually went and how hard I hit the deer. It was a basic doe; probably standing about 4 feet tall probably about 3 ft wide (those are just guesstimation) you know, the basic, you probably have seen it.

I've gotten to this point to where I am getting sick of seeing animals run across my car or in the middle of the street to where I run them over. I have killed two possums and potentially one deer/doe. I have no idea if I killed the deer I just know that I hit it

Mankind has become a materialistic piece of shit, aiming for the last iphone, new clothes, new sneakers, more profit, more income, more and more... We prefer to receive an amazon box than to be with somebody to love, we prefer to hide behind a screen rather than talk face to face, we prefer to use drugs to ""fix"" everything rather than change our lifestyle.

And what about food? All this processed/industrial food designed to keep us hungry by adding sugars or just by being refined carbs that is keeping us sick and feeding the healthcare machinery. We lose natural food because, again, profit. What a joke humans decided to make food cheaper by turning it into poison and now it's so available obesity is the norm: what a joke.

I have the whole thing on clip board if anyone wants it. So now is the fallout. Spent most of my rare day off talking with nice officers and lawyers and when everyone went home my awesome neighbor brought over a big ass bottle of tequila. So yes, currently I'm hammered.  My job is giving me fmla leave for 2 months to handle all this, they didn't have to but I'm valuable to them. Hard to find a salesperson like me that speaks 4 languages fluently and knows enough in 3 others to get by, yes, a bit of back patting, what awful novella doesn't have some.  

So, my other neighbor, aka HOA president, that I'm not a part of, decided to illegally trim my garden. It was my Nan's garden, I've really done nothing with it. He used a freaking torch on my lock, it would have been easier to take down the gd fence... So being the a hole I am I whooped his sorry ass. That I actually feel bad for, he didn't stand a chance with me despite being a head taller and weighing a buck 50 more. A few 10th planet gyms around here and all, lmfao, ok I don't feel that bad. So now onto how I deal with this.  I got advice to go as far as the legal system would and get counseling for my rage, which is fair, I really hate this dude who really can't affect me. My problem is he has 2 absolutely wonderful kids. I've hired these kids to do lawn work, I've bought all their school garbage, they know their dad is a lunatic, but they have no other family.  The 17 yrs old can be emancipated but he can't take custody of the 15 yrs old sister for another 5 months completely based on his age. I can't take custody either for about 25 different reasons, mostly I'm not home much. I sent my lawyer on a snipe hunt for more family but if I pursue legal action this amazing young women could end up in foster care. Are there other options? USA, btw, specifically Arizona.  Oh, and my lawyer is a finance guy, he's outsourcing, but it'll probably be Monday before we hear back. 

I'm also originally from the east coast, in my area there would be a lynching so I really have no gauge on this whole ordeal. Also I'm not incredibly proud of my area most days, they are ignorant racist, but they do have boundaries.

Randall lives a lot closer and works with my husband (he actually got my husband his job). Backstory about Randall and I. We met 10 years ago when we were both in college. I had actually become good friends with his girlfriend whom I shared a class with and was my lab partner for said class. Randall and I clicked pretty quickly. His girlfriend (who is still actually one of my closest friends and we were bridesmaids in each other's weddings) DID NOT like how much we had in common but we couldn't help it. When girlfriend broke up with Randall he came to me to deal with it. At the time I was engaged. Randall has a lot of shit in his life that I won't go into but basically he confided in me for a lot of things and when my then fiance and I broke up I confided in Randall for a lot of things. He was the only person beside my parents that knew I almost killed myself. Anyway all of that lead to this very special relationship between us. He is my brother and I am his sister and we would die for each other. (we have said this to each other). He was a groomsman in my wedding and walked down the aisle with my SIL as a representative of my family. He is the Godfather of my daughter (May is the Godmother but they are not together, May is married to an asshole but that's another story). All of this to say, I haven't seen Randall since my daughter's 1st birthday party. For reference she turns 2 December 19th. It isn't anyone's fault. His girlfriend lives a state away and he travels a lot with his new position at work. We text and whatnot but we haven't physicality seen each other I'm nearly a year. Going from seeing each other at the very least once a month for 10 years to not seeing each other for 10 months had been extremely hard. Tonight, my husband and I went to Happy Hour with his work department and about an hour after we'd been there Randall showed up! I was not expecting him at all so I was very very excited. We hugged and he saw his Goddaughter and saw how much she's grown. We made plans for next weekend. I absolutely hate that we went so long without seeing each other, but we were both busy.

62,"First of all I apologise if there are Grammer and punctuation mistakes cuz English isn't my mother tongue, also I rarely write posts so everything might be all over the place. 

It's been a few months already since I've been feeling so drained whenever I come back home from college. For me going to college (or anywhere that's not home) gives me more energy and sense of belonging so now that my sem break is coming, i get lesser classes therefore lesser reasons for me to convince my parents to let me go college. And i can't take public transports to go anywhere as my parents are so protective towards me and it's really making me so frustrated, driving myself to college is out of the question because i just got my driving license.

Furthermore, since i study art, my assignments require me to go to college to actually finish them but my parents get frustrated whenever i need to go there because it's an hour drive there and another 2 hours drive back home when there's traffic jam, not to mention that they need to take two trips as well. 

I mean I get that putting up with traffic jams is frustrating, so why not just let me take public transport instead? I've taken it plenty of times already with my friends and it's not like there're creeps loaded in public transports, most of them are just students and people going to work, just like me. But they insist that it is not safe for me, a girl, who's 18 years old to take public transport by myself. Backing up their reasoning with news from social media reporting about girls being harassed and stuff in public transport, (It's not like i don't get it) so obviously i rebuted by saying that I'll be more aware of my surroundings and that i can lessen their burden by using public transport but no, they just kept putting it down and scold me everytime. 

Bright side is after numerous conversations, I've finally convinced them to let me stay near my college and I honestly cannot wait to be free from their grasp next year.

69,"So at the moment, I'm living in South England in the countryside, there's a city nearby but it's small and less grandiose like many cities in this country.
As much as I love the countryside, it's peaceful and quite isolated, I feel like moving to the city is the best choice for someone like me in modern day society. I want to preferably start a Music Career or become a Lawyer (depending on whether I go to a University or not), and I feel like experiencing the city life is far more interesting and fascinating than staying in the country. I feel like it's easier socially (getting into relationships, networking etc) and it's just more fun to experience night life and cold, busy mornings in a city.
When I'm older, I hope to move to the USA, where I will live in a city and achieve my dreams there, and experience the life so many musicians and media speak of in the city.

70,"Okay so as of today I’m going to give up a habit. What is it you ask? Soda. More specificity Pepsi max / Diet Pepsi. I buy a 30 pack once a week and I drink it all in one week. 3 or 4 cans per day and depending on what I’m doing possibly 5 to 7 if I’m stressed or what ever. 


I spend $19 per week and I’m over it. I’m trying to lose weight and I’ve got almost everything down packed. Apart from this one massive crushing habit of mine. I call it a habit because I need to taste it. 


Yes water would do that but it’s not the same. Now this isn’t like smoking or anything else. I don’t smoke, no drugs, and I’m not a massive drinker of alcohol. 


This is my thing that I want to “quit” because I walk into the supermarket buy the 30 pack case and go. That’s the only thing I’m buying in and out. And I know a lot of people look at me strange. 


So day 1 is over but I don’t think it counts cuz I went to the movies and I drank a small soda.

72,"For a long time i've been struggling to accept myself and i reflected that by rejecting one of my names, since i was a little kid everyone knows me or calls me by a certain name (let's say it's X) but since a graduated from high school and when i was about to go to the uni, i started to use my middle name (B) \[context note: i'm from colombia so two names are normal here, all of this happened when i was 15 yo, so yeah i was a bit immature for uni, i ended up not entering to uni after the graduation, i took one sabbatical year to study english and think about what i would like to do with my life, it's still a young age to get to uni but, it's the usual in COL entering the uni after graduating from h.s\].

So because i hated how i was at the time i thought making the people call me by my middle name it was a new start for a new and better version of me. that was 5 years ago and a lot things happened, since that day i felt like my life was even more miserable than before but i still didn't want that people called me by X, i was so delusional, i didn't want to be the person that i was before but i wasn't acknowledging that even if i hated that version of myself that was me, i didn't want to accept that even the fact that i hated me it was still me i don't know how to explain better this part srry. 

But for months i've been thinking about that fact and it hurts me to accept it but im doing it, that excuse that i put myself through those selection of names its pointless because know that i'm using a new name i feel like i shittier version of me, that new name shit was pointless because i was hating myself more that i ever did\[with deep depression and a strong anxiety\], to the point that i was even considering killing myself for a while. 

About 2 weeks ago i got to the point of actually doing something to fix myself or atleast improve my current situation, i realized that if i don't start doing something to help me i'm probably going to live with this horrible version of me and end up killing me at some point, \[i know that i need therapy but the help for mental help here it's not cheap and i'm not prepared to talk with my parent about this yet, my mother is a single mom so i think that would crushed her\], the things that i'm doing right now are : first start using my X name(because i figured out that the reason for not using it was pointless and i honestly like this name more than the other) i feel like it's the first step to bring back together myself and to start in the process of loving myself, and second is to stop watching porn(because for almost two year this addiction destroyed me so i'm not going to let it destroy me more than i'm already are), and third even if sounds cliche start doing some outsides hobbies that i like. 

All of this with the final goal of overcoming my depression and anxiety at some point and finally start enjoy my life not just surviving. I really need to get this out of my chest, thanks to everyone reading, and have a great day. If you would like to tell me something i'm going to be glad to answer you.",07Nov2019,1

74,"1987, my fifth birthday at my Dad’s (divorced parents). I put on “I Want Your Sex” by George Michael. It was a hit that year, my mom was a big fan, I knew all the words and began singing and dancing to it.

The party was odd, my father invited all kids I didn’t know. But I didn’t mind because I had my party with my mom and my friends the weekend before. When my father heard the music, he started freaking out. He shut it off, screamed at me in front of everyone, then snapped the cassette in half, which made me cry for the rest of the party. It was the only birthday party my dad ever threw for me.

My dad drank a lot and was very controlling, so I always chocked it up to that as I grew up. A few years later, in the 90’s, he was convicted multiple times for pedophelia. And I just realized those kids at the party were likely some of his victims and why he hated me singing that song to them.

77,"Like I’m just going to lay here with my eyes closed until I go unconscious. I’m not dead but I’m going to make my self as defenseless as possible, almost inviting death to my door nightly. And once it happens I’m going to have these visions in my mind that I’m not really seeing because “seeing” implies the use of my eyes, which are closed. But I’m just thinking up this whole alternate universe, creating people and stories, heroes and villains all while I’m barely even alive and without having any real awareness of what I’m doing. And while it takes about 5-8 hours its feels like only moments for me. Like just a blink. And I’m back up. Alive. Ready to do it all over again the next night. Humans are certainly the strangest of all mortal beings. But none of this really even seems weird until you try and force yourself to do it. As if your mind and body are two separate beings in a mostly symbiotic relationship, except for when the body refuses “No no. I’m awake. I’m fine. Let’s gooooo.” And the mind yells back “Yeah but really you’re not. Just trust me on this. Just go unconscious for a few hours. It will most likely be fine.”",07Nov2019,1
78,"I work at a vet clinic and here in Australia it's late spring, which means it's Grass Seed Season. A good percentage of all our consults at this time of year are dogs that have got a grass seed stuck in their ear or paw, or sometimes even their face. Today we had one with a grass seed behind its eye. These seeds have little barbs that help them to burrow into fur and not come out. When they get stuck, they work their way into the skin and cause infections and abscesses which can be extremely painful and require surgery to remove. Grass seeds in the ear are especially painful and commonly require sedation or anaesthesia to remove as they are buried a long way into the ear canal (further in than you'd be able to see). Often we don't see these animals until they are in so much pain they refuse to be touched. 

We tell owners three things:

1. Keep your dog well groomed, especially around the head and paws. Long hair catches seeds and hides them.

2. Check your dog for grass seeds after every walk.

3. Don't let your dog play in long grass! In Australia this last point is doubly true because it's where snakes love to hang out too. 

So please follow these rules and prevent yourself and your dog a painful and costly trip to the vets. If you see your dog shaking its head or tilting it to one side, get it checked out because it could well be a grass seed (or an infection, which is also common).",07Nov2019,1
79,"Honestly. I fear my cats mortality more than my own.

I will have no reason to be here when he is gone. I am alone without a support system. I have no close friends and do not contact my abusive family. My childhood was awful and my parents did anything they could to control me and make me feel like garbage.

My cat is literally the first and only living creature to honestly show me unconditional love. Everything I do, I do for him. My career choices (in vet med field) and living spaces (he's missing his front right leg) are tailored for him. 

I rescued him from a parking lot after he had been hit by a car and left for dead all day. He needed extensive medical care and was very feral. It was strongly recommended that I euthanize him...but I couldnt do it. It was so weird-- I just KNEW he was going to be my cat before I had even met him. 

He has been through 2 amputations (both on his front right limb, he is now missing his entire leg and shoulder blade due to radial nerve damage after being hit), and has seen numerous cardiologists and internal medicine specialists. 

He is now the most loving, protective cat I have ever met (while somehow remaining feral/sceptical toward anyone else). He is my cuddle buddy, my company, my source of comfort, my closest family, and my best friend. 

He always comes when called, meets me at the door every day when I get home, has conversations with me, and always sits on or near me with his tail touching me in some way. When I am trying to fall asleep, he flops onto my chest and purrs me to sleep. If i am having a rough day and cant get out of bed, he literally digs me out from underneath the covers. There was one day I had been laying in my hammock in the backyard alone. When I went to finally go inside, my feelings of isolation totally vanished when I saw that he had set up camp in the window and had been keeping an eye on me from the house. He understands me more than anyone or anything ever has. He is literally my soul-kitty. He has saved me more than I've saved him. 

I was so miserable until I found him. I have other cats, but they arent as bonded to me. I have told numerous therapists that my life will end when he dies. He is only 4, so it is a long way off, but he is literally my whole reason to be here. As an athiest especially, the thought of losing him terrifies me. My life was so empty and purposeless before i met him, and i cant / wont go back to that.

82,"Hi guys. My dad seemed to always regret having kids. My parents divorced in 5th grade and in 7th he sought a recruiter to live in Qatar for 2 years. He met a woman there and extended it 3 more years. I was a senior in high school when he finally came home. My freshman year of college I spent in Spain, and I knew he was engaged to my step mom, and he did ask my brother and I for our permission. My now step mom is not American and they were working with visas and had to get married at a certain time, but promised a courthouse wedding and would have the ceremony when I got home mid December. (This is 2017)

Late November 2017, I was procrastinating on homework and called him randomly. We talked for 30 mins and at the end of the conversation, he mentioned my step mom and him would get married in a week and they would be having the wedding at a hotel and it would be a ceremony. It was 9 days before I got home from Spain... I asked if he could have waited and I thought it was going to be a courthouse wedding and I could attend the ceremony, and he told me all of this in passing when I called HIM. I was upset and my step mom told me she was sorry and she’d FaceTime me when she was getting ready and I could see the dress before even my dad saw it, and I would be called during the dinner. I agreed. 

The day of, my brother who I rarely talk to, sent me a photo of them hand in hand walking out of the hotel. Married. My brother was the best man. And I got no phone call. 

I bawled my eyes out and it’s now 12am in Spain and they call at the dinner but I was so upset and crying that I didn’t answer. I missed the whole thing. I waited 3 days so I wouldn’t ruin their day before I reached out to my dad saying how disappointed I was that they promised all these things and in the end, I was totally left out. They had the audacity to save me chocolates from their wedding when I got home 9 days later. It has always been such a sore spot for me. 

Currently, I rarely talk to my dad. He supports me financially in college, for which I’m very grateful for, but I have always wanted more emotional availability or support or whatever from him. My whole life I felt like he doesn’t fully care. He fixes my car sometimes and gives me money, but he never initiated conversation unless he has a question. 

We recently had Canadian thanksgiving and road tripped north to spend it with my grandparents. He told me he’d pick me up at 5 and when we arrived, my grandma asked if I was excited. I guess? Thanksgiving? No. My ENTIRE extended family was flying in and we were doing an entire itinerary of events planned by my aunt and grandma they’ve been spending months on and I wasn’t told anything. 

This weekend my aunt is in town and I thought I told them I was coming in person when I saw him last, and I texted my dad asking if arriving Friday was good. Well they already filled the entire weekend and I was not included in any of these plans. That was the tipping point. 

I told him I felt like I wasn’t included and was very upset and even brought up the wedding and how I just felt like he didn’t care about me beyond financial support. I just wanted more attention from my dad, I guess. I felt like he didn’t care and never did. Another example is at 12 years old he dropped me off at the door of my pediatrician and said he’d pick me up in an hour. I had to call him on the office phone because I needed to be 13 before I could go in without my parent to sign me in. 

Well, he called me yesterday. I brought up the wedding again and how that still deeply upset me. He said I was a selfish bitch for ruining his wedding (for being upset). I cried. And my step mom texted me quote: “I suggest you talk to your therapist as these thoughts are unhealthy”. 

I just wanted more attention from my dad, I guess. I’m 21 and have been trying all my life. I’m done. Am I being unreasonable? Did I actually ruin his wedding for being upset? Am I just being needy? Did I do something wrong or being ungrateful for his financial support?",07Nov2019,1

My friend had sat up a tour of his college campus for me and after I'd be staying in the dorms that night. I would then go see how his classes are and talk to his teachers. He's going into something specific and was able to set all of this up for me with one of his teachers.

I've been clean from booze for awhile now and am proud of it. Yesterday I told my teacher that I wouldn't be able to take an oral exam on Friday since I have a college visit. He then asked if I would be able to take it after school, Thursday, and I said that I would be staying in the dorms there. He asked why. I said that it was sat up that way. I'm the kind of guy who says whatever comes to mind when asked a question, so when he asked why it was sat up that way I replied with, ""to get the full college experience."" He said that he knew what that meant and gave me an unpleasant look which was followed with the entire class staring at me. His comment has made me feel just terrible ever since. Not just because I've been clean, but also because I've worked hard to fix my reputation. After seeing everyone stare at me, I feel just terrible.

91,"Flux

To be idle is to die, to live is a perpetual state of moving - going - being - gerunding. 
Homeostasis is not stable at all; it’s constant acts of balancing - changing - rearranging.
Flux is the most stable state on earth; if you’re not going with the flow or against the tide, you’re drowning. 
Breathe it in, but if you don’t breathe it out you’re done with inspiration. 
Plateaus are appropriate to catch your breath, then throw yourself to heighten your ‘x’. The higher you fly, the farther the fall, but learn how to land and your damage you command. 
Winds don’t stop, they strike and stir, replenishing and rustling that which has lost velocity.
If you’re not active, you’re dying, anything but trying will debilitate you from the liberty we have to move. 
Synapse firing, thoughts unwinding, hearts desiring, words conspiring - all acting in constant expectation of the present linking to another present. 
Stay being. Open your eyes to seeing, ruminating on what you’re listening can move your feet to where you’re dreaming. 
To love is to be feeling.
Start going, be comfortable with changing. 
If you slow, you’re stopping, but moving constantly; for even when you’re edging death you’re dying.
You are moving, acting, living. 
Embrace the flux and keep on being.

94,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I’ve been with my girlfriend for almost a year now, and I couldn’t be happier. I genuinely feel like we’re right for each other, and I’m grateful that I got to know her... which is why I can’t really explain this last bit.

A few months ago, my friends and I were at this club having fun and partying the night away. I stayed sober the whole time, but most of them were drunk off their asses and left with a taxi a bit early, so I stayed there for a while longer with another guy friend, and he’d promised he’d take me home. A few more drinks, and he was off apologizing that he couldn’t take me anymore because he was trying to hook up with this girl and I’d “kill the mood” or whatever. Great.

I go over to one of the couches at the club and order an Uber, as I notice this girl I know coming over and sitting next to me on the couch. We smile and greet each other and she sits next to me. I wouldn’t even call her a friend, because we don’t really ever interact that much, except for that one night. Also, it seemed like she was well aware of everything she was doing, and hadn’t had anything to drink (we were sitting at the bar for a while and I hadn’t seen her coming over at all too, so I do think she was sober).

Anyways, she starts inching closer as we’re sitting there, but I don’t think anything of it, I assume she’s just adjusting the way she’s sitting. She then says “you’re boring”, and I dismiss it by saying “I have to go, I’m just ordering the Uber”.  She then comes closer so that we’re shoulder to shoulder, and then adjusts herself one more time so that she’s resting her head on my chest.

I don’t know what to do but figure it’s harmless; it’s not like I was doing anything wrong, and that I could just wait for the Uber to show up. She keeps asking me to do something fun and pushes onto me further and further and I say “no, I’ll probably have to go soon.” She gets up for a second, turns back round, and sits down almost on top of me. 

I really can’t explain this, but since she’d almost sat on my arm, I put it around her as opposed to completely removing myself from the situation. If that wasn’t enough, I also had my hands rubbing on the inside of her thighs. I also started engaging her in that conversation, saying things like “it’s not like you’re any fun either,” and it was clear where the conversation was leading. (We didn’t go any further than feelies though, and it didn’t get more sexual than her thighs).

I’m glad something stopped me because I then said I just had to leave, got up, and dashed to the bathroom first. I felt like crying, but the feeling that overwhelmed me first was sickness - I ended up vomiting for some reason. I left the bathroom, got into the backseat, and cried. I still think about it to this day, the guilt eats at me all the time. I love my girlfriend, and I know she loves me way too much, which is why it sucks to think I’d put myself in this position. I need help, should I confess the situation to her or not? I know her, and how sensitive she is; something like this would break her, and I don’t think I have it in me to tell her.

TL;DR: Have a girlfriend for about a year, but I had my hands around and on this girl I know. Stopped myself before anything else happened, threw up, cried. I need advice, do I tell her or not?",07Nov2019,1
95,"I'm a pretty simple person and I get satisfied pretty easily. Basic necessities and a social life is all I need to be at least neutral. I find no pleasure in material things and the endless pursuit of them. Well that's only half true, I understand what it feels like to buy something new and how exciting it can be but no matter what it is it's a feeling that goes away very quickly.

I'm interested in doing social work for a good cause. I want to be fulfilled knowing that I have helped humans or animals in a community to live a better life. I want to feel like I can make a difference and use my privileged upbringing to help unfortunate souls live a better quality of life and have opportunities to be the best human beings they can be.

But instead I'm in massive debt for the next 6 years which I'm tirelessly working to close. I'm barely able to make savings but this financial wreckage is my fault. I spent my entire life being told and chasing things I never wanted. I had the opportunity to go to a foreign country in a somewhat prestigious university and I blew it.

It always feels like I don't fit in with this culture. What I want from life is a spiritually and socially rich one. I want my loved ones to be happy and taken care of, I want to be self sufficient without bothering anyone else and I want to indulge in social experiences this life has to offer.

Still, I count my blessings. I have a decent job I can work from home which is a lucrative career path. It's better than being unemployed and struggling to pay debt like I was 2 years ago.

Our world is littered with waste, extremely dependent on fossil fuels, very consumer driven and in the process we are destroying our mother nature who nourishes us. I don't want to be a part of a world where this the reality. I want to heal the world in my own small contribution. That feels like my true calling. To be a part of a world which is being replenished, be it nature or humanity. That's how I want to spend my time and energy.

I have been in it for almost 2 years now, but I love my company, I believe in them and I feel like they really appreciate me. Its def still considered a start-up, we have had a lot of ups and downs the past few years and a lot of hires and lay offs, the company even shut down for a few weeks, (we thought we all lost our jobs) before finding a new investor.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I went down to ATL for the first time this year to see everyone in person and meet the new team in place for our ""soft reset"" on the company. We have about 10 people on the team, but its really an incredible team. We have some insanely successful people on that team with incredible resumes, four of them are already self-made millionaires who are just in it for the thrill (and the money of course), and Im so excited to see where this company is headed. The 10 people they have left on the team are the ones they say they believe can get the company to where it needs to be, that we are the most driven, smartest and capable group of people they have ever seen, and I do believe it. Me, on the other hand, I felt like the shittest, lowest person on that team. Yes, I am smart and capable, but fuck man, I feel like complete shit after last night. All of these incredibly successful and talented, smart people, who know their craft, and speak with confidence and ease, and I can't even get myself to say what's on my mind half the time because my words don't make sense when they come out of my mouth.

&amp;#x200B;

I got into this job by working a multitude of temp office jobs, and this company just clicked with me. I started doing basic data entry, and now I manage a part of the AR, AP, collections, order processing and invoicing/EDI. I still get paid the same as when I just began two years ago, but again, I work from home and this company has had a lot of ups and downs and is a ""start-up,"" so I'm not expecting more pay until we can actually make a profit. Thats fine with me, I dont mind, Im okay working in my own little world and getting my stuff done (even though I hate most of it) because it comes easy to me and doesn't take up much time most days. I love the freedom of it all.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, after yesterday's all-day discussion on where the company is going, and how we all feel about, I am more pumped than ever of this team......but I feel like I dont belong there anymore. Outside of work, like at the bar the other day, I can hold a conversation easily with any of them. Im not afraid of them, I enjoy their company, I make jokes and I feel like I can be friends with all of them. But in the office, holding meetings and talking about the company, I dont know jackshit. Yes, I have been there for two years, but all I am doing is back-office financials and reporting while they are all in the battlelines fighting the war. Literally all of them.

&amp;#x200B;

I was the quietest and least knowledgeable person at the table. And when I did speak, because I was so afraid of my incompetence and intimidated by their skills, I sounded like an adolescent teenager whose voice quivers when they speak. I feel like they all looked at me like I was an idiot. And while I am one the youngest at the table, I know my shit, I know my day to day ins and outs, but I don't know finance, I don't know accounting, I only know my actual job, if that makes sense. I don't have a degree, I didn't have any accounting experience before this job, I dont speak ""accounting"" like my boss does. I can't get him the answer he needs sometimes because I don't know what the fuck he is talking about, I just look like an idiot. I know that I am not an idiot, I am very smart, but communication blows me the hell up.

&amp;#x200B;

No matter how much I try and put myself out there, I can't get over this communication barrier because I overthink and fuck everything up in my head before it even gets out of my mouth. I am much much better at one on one conversations, but in a meeting I am useless.

&amp;#x200B;

Point being, I feel so lost and unsure of my life right now, I want to leave this job. I feel like I would be happier working at an Amazon warehouse (if I could get past the shame my family would give me) or working at a school or library, somewhere where I don't have to hold damn meetings I don't half understand. But then again, I would feel like I am wasting my life away too, not living up to my potential. I would go back to school (I only have a few classes left to get my degree) but I don't know what the hell to do with it. Its not going to get me any more jobs, and I can easily get corporate jobs without it, with all the temp experience. I have. I could transfer to uni with the degree and get a bachelor's in something, but I don't know what. I hate accounting and finance, again, I only do it because it comes easily to me, but I don't want a career in it.

&amp;#x200B;

I enjoy writing, and I want to write a book one day, but that's so far in the future I can't depend on that for my survival right now. I just feel completly useless in the world right now. I want to be at the top of my game, but I don't know what my game is or even should be. I've always agreed with the saying that you should find a field, stick with it, and climb the ranks until you are the best in your profession. But I don't know what the hell that could be for me. Am I really such a worthless human being that I can't find a place in the world where I can do some good and make a name for myself? Will my future children even be proud of the person I become, or am I going to be a miserable accountant in the back office for the rest of my life?

&amp;#x200B;

Like being a mom to 7 kids at a farm or making dishes or working at a newspaper feels like it would be more fulfilling to me than what I currently have. Working with my hands or using my creativity seems like it would be an incredible opportunity for me, but how could I ever track down the exact thing I want to do? Im not afraid of hard work, but I am afraid of wasting my time and evidently my life. My job is challenging at times, but it just feels like a challenge I don't even need to overcome, like this field isn't for me, and its just another temp job I have to go through.

&amp;#x200B;

Another crazy thing is that I am incredibly confident in my day to day life and within my group of family and friends. I am the leader of the pack and the loudest, the party planner and the risk-taker. But at the job, and I am the pathetic girl with no degree who cant hold her own in a meeting. What the fuck is up with that? I thrive at conversating with new people and getting people talking, especially when they come over to my house, and I love hosting and planning and being the loud voice of reason and humor at any gathering, but at work I am nobody, and it kills me inside, and I don't know how to get out of it. I put myself out there, I try, but I just can't overcome the anxiety and patheticness I feel inside at work.

&amp;#x200B;

I kinda hate myself for moving out of my parent's house, because even if I wanted to quit I couldn't, due to the rent. But then again, I was sharing a room with two of my sisters and had my office in there, and it was almost unmanageable, especially with my sister working 24-hour shifts and needing to sleep while I needed to work. And to be honest, I'm afraid to quit in a sense. Its just a great company and the people are so great, I feel like I would be making a mistake leaving the incredible potential of this. See how insane this is? I am unhappy with all of it, but the idea of quitting scares me.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways fuck me for spending 45 minutes writing this and not working, but I needed to vent. There's just something about writing it all down that just helps you figure out where you are. If you read this far, you deserve gold. If you have any advice or similar experiences, I definitely want to hear them. But of course, I am so egotistic in that sense, I feel like I am the only one who has ever felt like this; to me it seems like everyone else around me either has their life together or has more ""manageable"" problems, while I'm stuck with figuring out my effin brain.",07Nov2019,1

101,"Quick Information: Me and my childhood friend are 25 years old. My mom is 42 years old.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know where to start. Me and my little sisters have no idea what happened to mom. It started last year in August after dad had died in a bus accident while visiting our relatives in Lebanon. His passing left us helpless, sad, and tired. The one who was most tormented by the news was mom, she lost the desire to live, she really suffered. Mom cried day in and day out. She did not leave the house the first three months.

&amp;#x200B;

We received many prayers from the people of Lebanon, they paid tribute to dad. Dad was known there because mom won a beauty contest in 96 the same year she and dad were newlyweds. Dad left behind a family that loved him immensely. My sisters and I had the hardest time the first month, but it became easier after that, but not for mom. It felt like she had lost the other half of her heart. My childhood friend James was always there and supported us during this difficult period.

&amp;#x200B;

A short time after dad's death, sometime at the beginning of this year, my mother changed completely. She was no longer the same person, her personality had changed. She was constantly angry, stressed, violent and aggressive. Examples of events she was involved in. In February this year, when mom and my sisters were out shopping, I was told by my sisters that mom had quarreled with two women in the vegetable market. My sisters said the women were picking vegetables and that it took time, so mom lost patience and quarreled with them, screamed at them and insulted them.

&amp;#x200B;

In May we had a barbecue party, I invited James and his sister Nathalie home to us. In the middle of the barbecue party mom slapped Nathalie in the face just because she accidentaly spilled something. James got angry and wanted to confront mom, I took him aside and said that mom is having a hard time because of dad's passing. He understood that and meant he just wanted to talk to her. After all, I assumed that mom behaved this way because of dad. She was stressed and easily became angry.

&amp;#x200B;

A month later in June, when mom and I were out in the garden mowing the plants, she suddenly started arguing with the neighbor's daughter. The neighbor's daughter stared at us while we were working in the garden and mom lost it completely and started screaming at her and calling her terrible things. I brought mom into the house and asked her to calm down, I said it was embarrassing for her to do so to a fifteen year old girl. I asked her why she has changed and behaves as she does, she stood up, pushed me away and called me names. Mom's aggressive and problematic behavior continued.

&amp;#x200B;

Between September and October, can't really remember, I called Nathalie to come over and help my sister with an essay. Mom got into a dispute with Nathalie once again. I remember that mom asked Nathalie to do something, but she refused and it made mom spit Nathalie in the face and they got into a fist fight. I came in between and put an end to it. I apologized to Nathalie and drove her home. James saw what had happened and said that if mom doesn't calm down then he'll help us with something. I had no idea but said she needed time to get over dad.

&amp;#x200B;

About two weeks ago when we ate at home on the dining table. My youngest sister started whining about that she wanted to go home to her friend, mom said no and that made my sister to keep whining. Mom lost her composure and threw her plate on my sister's head, I immediately drove her to the emergency room and they sewed the wound she had on her forehead. I told the doctor that she had fallen to avoid the cops.

&amp;#x200B;

I came home but said nothing to mom. James found out what had happened, my other sister told him, he came over and we talked. He said he had booked a hotel here nearby for him and mom, he said he would help her forget dad and start over. I looked at him thoughtfully, James explained that he can help, but she needs to go with him to this hotel and that I needed to allow it first. James is a good friend of mine, he knows my family and I his. I said okay and wondered how long they would be gone, he said a week and then they are back. It was hard to convince mom, it took two days but then she agreed.

&amp;#x200B;

James had specifically asked me not to call him or my mom, because it would confuse things, I agreed with it because the hotel was still close by, I had no address but I knew the area, about two hours with car. I did not visit them. I took care of my sisters that week, with a little help from Nathalie. Mom and James came back last Friday. I tell you, my mom just looked completely different, I greeted and took her bag. James was in the car, I went out and asked how it went, he said mom would not be a problem anymore, that he helped her. He gave me no more explanation than that. And indeed, mom was different, I knew it in my guts. Mom hugged my sisters a lot, she talked to them for the rest of the day.

&amp;#x200B;

On Saturday it was the same, mom woke up and was positive, she looked motivated again, like before when dad was alive. How much my sisters whined and talked, mom was still calm and answered all their questions. The next day on Sunday, my mother took my sisters to their friends. I am really surprised how she has been since she returned last Friday. I asked her what happened over there in the hotel, she said it was nothing, that she just changed environment. She said she needed to go on such trips with James more often because it helped her. She did not explain more than that.

&amp;#x200B;

I wonder what happened to my mom. I wonder what James did to make her change completely and become normal again. I trust my friend but it's something that still didn't feel right since I saw my mom after she came back. I don't know how to get mom or James to talk.",07Nov2019,1

103,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 8 months and we’re long distance. We recently just hung out after not seeing each other for 3 months. He spent a day with me and when I asked him to stay one more day he told me he needed to prep for work and needed 5 days to do so. When I asked again he got mad and broke up with me. He doesn’t like it when I ask him to stay the night over and over when he says no. I just miss him a lot and get really sad. During the “ 5 days he was supposed to be prepping for work” he slept all day and played video games. ( he’s a car salesman) he than called me and said I had one more chance not to mess up and If I asked him to stay another night after saying no he would get his stuff and never talk to me again. Another thing is when I call him he always answers the phone with “ what” “ I don’t wanna talk” “ leave me alone” we barley talk and when we do he’s most of the time grumpy. If I don’t let him get off the phone and leave him alone he’ll breakup with me. If he’s mad he’ll breakup with me know matter if it’s big or small. I just need help all I’m trying to do is spend time with him and love him. Recently he’s been calling more and kinda acting like he wants to talk. The thing that really bothers me is that I have to walk on eggshells for him or he breakups with me. I have to do what he says even if we haven’t talked all day and I call him to see how he is and he doesn’t wanna talk I have to get off the phone. I’m the type of girl who wants to show affection especially since we’re in a long distance relationship and he was at first but as we got further in the relationship he doesn’t show affection. The most affection I get is him saying I love you. I want more than that like flirting, just I miss you, something small can mean so much. I don’t want my relationship to be “boring” I just want us to workout but I’m the type of girl who needs to be reassured and yes that’s something I can work on but I don’t feel like it’s wrong wanting to be shown love by your boyfriend.

105,"Just a rant about me being tired of faking it. 

I live in a foreign country so I don’t speak my mother tongue on daily bases. I go to a uni which is in 2 languages. One of them is my second language, English, and another is a 3rd language (French). Most of the time I can get by with my limited French but it’s becomes harder and harder. I have to call people and ask them questions in French. Answer messages in French. Send formal emails in French. Call more people in French. It’s so hard to do. Pronunciation is hard and so is grammar. Each time I make a sentence I have to translate it from English to French. And surprise surprise, it sounds like I translated it from English to French. People who actually speak it aren’t too willing to help or respond too slowly in situations when I need answer ASAP, thus they are useless. I have to do so many things in this language right now and if I fail, I’m pretty much out of this country, not just uni. Thus each day I have to pretend to understand what ppl r talking about, somehow interact and its just the hardest thing. 

Plus I’m tired of pretending like I got my shit together. I’m tired of pretending like shit is alright. Things are falling apart and I cannot control any of this. Each morning I have a routine which gives me a fake feeling of things being “together”.  My apartment is nice and clean for exactly the same reason, just to give me a fake sensation of having my life at least a little bit together. 

I can’t even ask for help for the project because I need to phrase it In this damn language that has been ruining my life. I have been so stressed that I cannot concentrate on anything, thus making my situation even more difficult. I envy people who study in a language that they are fluent at.

i am 19, F, 112 lbs 5’3 very healthy (i workout daily, eat a well balanced diet). nothing seems to be physically wrong with me except for the fact that for the last two months i’ve been experiencing reoccurring chest pains ( some sharp, some just feel sore) right above my heart and across my chest, and my back.. i use to smoke weed regularly until about a month ago where i thought this pain was related to that. i have this pain whether I am high or not. 

I also assumed it’s anxiety. i have a bad anxiety disorder and ever since the vaping deaths came out i started experiencing this pain (i only smoked thc vapes never nicotine) the pain is worse when i fixate on it and my anxiety levels are really high. however, when my anxiety levels are normal and balanced, it’ll still occur. 

what could be happening with me? i have a doctors appointment next tuesday but i just wanted to get an idea before i went to the doctor on potential issues.

So I noticed... pairing a fairly simple and skimpy top with a more modest,more colorful, flowy/baggy skirt or pair of pants or overalls looks really nice and personally I love dressing by that. It could also be that type of dress that's long and flowy but has little to no sleeves and/or a v-neck, and may or may not have a lot of colors and patterns.

On the flip side,though not as much, I think a lot of other women (not me unfortunately) can really pull off something like long sleeves or a hoodie with a mini skirt/skinny jeans/shorts/leggings. So, the opposite. I look sloppy when I do that. I think shorter,thinner, more ""ruler shaped"" people pull it off best. (I'm not that tall or that fat so IDK man...)

I work in the kitchen section, and there is a cashier who drives me crazy.

For example: she demonstrates something, asks me if I got it, I say yes, and she replies with ‘no you didn’t’ This alone happened like 12 times this month. In a restaurant, you have to work fast. I know this. But she over exaggerates it. Asks me to put fries in the frier, I say ‘done’ and do it, she asks me about those fries, I say ‘not ready yet’ she waits for a few seconds and asks the same question over and over again.

Treats me like an idiot, repeatedly tells me to do something while I’m already doing it, (not my boss btw) gets on my nerves all the time. She has the face of a blobfish, never smiles, you can’t possibly enjoy your job when she’s there.

Now this is where it gets morally dirty: She’s pregnant. Like ‘ready to explode any minute’ pregnant. No one should’ve let her work there for even a minute. Obviously there’s something about this woman that I don’t know about yet. There is a reason they let her work. And just by watching her talk to other workers and supervisors, everyone can tell that she’s on very thin ice. Any inconvenience could get her fired. I can’t even stand to see her while working, it would be a lot better for everyone if she quit/got fired, and I don’t know what to do about this. I can’t quit bc I’m a student who really needs the money. (Money is good tbh)

 I’m seriously considering taking painkillers/ relaxing pills before going over to my shifts.

A few months ago my boyfriend and I broke up. I took the decision to come back in France, in order to be closer to my family and to have the opportunity to start fresh. So I had to leave my friends and my job.

Now this is where it gets morally dirty: She’s pregnant. Like ‘ready to explode any minute’ pregnant. No one should’ve let her work there for even a minute. Obviously there’s something about this woman that I don’t know about yet. There is a reason they let her work. And just by watching her talk to other workers and supervisors, everyone can tell that she’s on very thin ice. Any inconvenience could get her fired. I can’t even stand to see her while working, it would be a lot better for everyone if she quit/got fired, and I don’t know what to do about this. I can’t quit bc I’m a student who really needs the money. (Money is good tbh)

 I’m seriously considering taking painkillers/ relaxing pills before going over to my shifts.

I know it’s going to be this way for another month at most (because she’s like 8 months into pregnancy) but I don’t know if I can take this sh*t for another month, or even for another day.",07Nov2019,1
122,"I suffer from a chronic illness but its been stabilized with meds as long as I manage my lifestyle and stress properly. 

Recently I got blindsided by some BS at home and now have to deal with the major stress that it’s causing me. Lots of self doubt and anxiety. Can’t concentrate. Have good and bad days but on bad days I’m literally paralyzed and even had intrusive thoughts. I have a pretty stressful job and it’s not helping. With the support of my doctors and my employer, I’ve decided to take a month off on medical leave so I can attend therapy and heal mentally and physically. 

I asked for my leave to start in two weeks so i can finish up an important work assignment I’m currently in the middle of and since I’m working from home while on this assignment, (not having to deal with the day to day in-office stress and just work at my own pace and not having to deal with people) I’m starting to feel better so guilt is setting in that I’ll be taking off an extra month soon, leaving my colleagues to deal with all the work during busiest time of the year. I’m actually considering rescinding my medical leave so I can go back to work to relieve my colleagues but then I know my problems will still be there because then i haven’t really dealt with it. I know I need to take care of myself before both my mental and physical health take a serious toll, but I’ve never been one to attend therapy or take leaves, I’ve always just managed and convinced myself to pull up my big girl pants, put on a brave face and deal with it because business needs to go on. I feel guilty, ashamed and embarrassed for taking the time off for “self care”, even though deep down I know it’s best for me in the long run.

Does anyone ever feel this way? How do I stop this guilt and put myself first?",07Nov2019,1
123,"After a rough few months and some hard decisions, I feel like everything is now falling into place and for the first time in a long while, I'm excited about the future and what it holds. I can actually see one. 

I am now studying a course I absolutely love and excel in, have made some really nice friends and feel like I am respected. I am no longer dreading talking to my father or older sister about my life because I'm actually going somewhere for once. I can't quite describe what all this feels like but it's a mix of excitement, joy and relief.

My social, professional and family life have all drastically improved. I was so depressed for so long and I can't help but brag about finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. Granted not everything is perfect, my love life certainly isn't, but I'm sure I'll find someone when I'm ready to. Here's to never giving up!",07Nov2019,1
124,"I feel so bad. After 2 months of riding, I dropped my motorcycle. It was at a parking lot nonetheless. Slow maneuver to a right turn and mistakes were made. Grabbed the front brake too hard (lesson 1: use rear on those moments) and heel of the shoes caught a little on the footpegs resulting to a late foot down. The fall was slow as I was gradually lowering the bike to avoid damage as much as possible. No visible damage except for a slighty bent handlebar which took most of the weight. F*cked up my back tho, carrying all that weight slowly downwards (lesson 2: bike is repairable, my back is not). A really humbling experience.",07Nov2019,1
