0,"Last night I was chased by a psycho woman on drugs (that I see around here often in my town) and there was cops and everything. It happened to be right here on my street front of my house. 
We were having a stand off with her as she refused to come out from where she was hiding. 
After few minutes of arguing with her, she finally broke out into a murderous rage sprint toward me, I started running toward one of the police SUV, yelling for the cops to help, only to have them nowhere to be seen. 
Then there happened to be an officer I didn’t see on the other side of the SUV, who was running toward the lady and proceeds being stabbed repeatedly by her and died. 
Then I see another police car with screaming sirens rushing toward me on the street, stopping just near front of my house, and stepped out a... prison CO! 
The plot thickened even further. He shot the lady and didn’t faze as he walked toward me in quick paces with nothing registered on his face except somber. 
I started to panic when I recognized his face and he just keeps walking toward me crouching behind a police SUV. He proceeds to start aim for my heart as he got very close to me.

I YELPED LOUDLY AND SMASHED A MUG OFF MY NIGHT STAND SCATTERED ON MY FLOOR. 
Goddamn you Stephen King. You delivered. 
I shouldn’t have watched Castle Rock before bedtime.

My dog, meanwhile was like WTF and knew his job. Got up on my bed and laid his head on my chest.

2,"19F, America

I recently had to withdraw from all of my college courses. I wasn’t full-time to begin with, but it hurts how much money I wasted. I couldn’t attend class for 2 weeks because I was recovering from something that I won’t disclose here. Now I can’t attend college until January 27th (the beginning of the spring term). I don’t know what to do in the meantime. I have no friends. It was lonely even attending class, but it served as a distraction from my lackluster and boring life. Now I have nothing besides drawing and my phone to distract me, and that can only do so much.",17Nov2019,1
3,"Little personal victory. I'm not a party person, never have been. When I was younger my mom used to try and get me to drink alcohol to loosen up at parties a bit, in her own words. She did this by giving me a glass of what was apparently soda, which was really a mixed drink. Kinda turned me off to alcohol for a long time. I just turned 21 this week, but a few months ago a few of my friends agreed to help me. They really just had to be there and watch me for a bit, all I needed I guess. They got me to drink a little bit. Helped me realize it's just not that big of a deal. On my 21st I was able to drink a little bit more. Was also able to just casually have some light alcoholic drinks. It's just nice.

Still no real interest in ever actually getting drunk. But having the option helps me a bit. My vault feels lighter.",17Nov2019,1

6,"Even though I never saw any of your faces, it didn't change the fact that you were willing enough to make me feel better. I hope the best to come for all of those who hoped the best for me.

I recently found out that my friend had died from a stroke. I never thought that something like that could happen to literally anyone. He never had problems prior (at least that I knew of). Families beyond my own reached out to my friend's parents to support them through these times. 

As for myself, I can't say that I left him with a great last conversation. But I hope he still knew that I would come around eventually. And, even if he was still here, I would.

So, I guess before I go for now, I'll say this. Your friends aren't truly your friends unless they can live through the bad times. Every relationship you will ever have will be hateful, awkward, toxic, or distrustful in some way. The only way to know if you can say that you're their friend is if you can get past those days.

They leave drugs in society so they can have control, Sure there’s a very small percentage of people that do crimes while sober but majority of crimes committed are because the person is drugged up out of there mind, It’s the same thing with ciggerettes, We all know they are bad for you and provide no benefits for your health and can kill you but yet they still allow them to be sold legally, Why? To much money at stake, Then finally we have, Cancer, Think about this if we really wanted to find a cure or a stop to cancer then we would of, Millons and millons of dollers has been invested into cancer and they still say they need more money and time, We created electricity, They learned how to transplant organs,Created phone networks, And there saying they can’t create a cure for cancer?

11,"I have early stage osteoarthritis (OA) in all of my joints. It is painful and debilitating, the bane of my existence. The only viable treatment for my condition is culture-expanded mesenchymal stem cells, harvested from my bone marrow and injected directly into the joints. Unfortunately for me and millions of others with joint pain, the FDA has regulated this therapy out of existence in the US for the foreseeable future, so only way to get it is by paying tens of thousands of dollars in cash at clinic in an offshore haven where the U.S.-based proprietor has government approval.

With a $30,000 gift from my father, I received this treatment at the foreign clinic in Feb 2017. We treated about half of my joints, targeting the most painful ones. It was no ""miracle cure,"" and some joints did better than others, but it DID result in dramatic overall improvement. For reasons beyond the scope of this post, I'm certain it wasn't a placebo effect. It gave me my life back. I could work and exercise conservatively without much pain. I even felt good enough to date a little for the first time in over a decade. I spend the next two years working tirelessly, putting in 70 hour weeks in a call center to save for a second treatment.

In Dec 2018, 22 months after my first treatment, I returned to the offshore clinic for my second round of injections. I paid about another $30K to do a massive treatment, hitting most of the untreated joints and re-treating some of the same ones we hit in 2017. I was stoked to get even more improvement.

10 weeks after receiving this second treatment, things were going well, and I was getting very noticeable improvements in most of the joints treated. I could feel a definite reduction in the degree of stiffness and crepitus in my joints, which is the telltale sign of cartilage regeneration.

On Feb 16, I was invited to an old friend's birthday party, which included dinner and duckpin bowling. I was unsure whether I should participate in the latter, because I was concerned that it could place too much stress on some of the joints that I had just had treated, particularly my hand and wrist. Too much stress on the joints too soon can cause the newly formed cartilage in the joints to break down, resulting in treatment failure.

I remember sitting in the restaurant and internally debating whether to bowl. I was clearly aware that doing so was a risk, and didn't really want to, but for some reason, was very uncomfortable at the thought of excusing myself from the group. My recollection of what when on in my head in those moments is vague, but I didn't want to deal with the discomfort of facing the others, explaining that I had to leave, and saying goodbye.

So I decided to accompany the group to the bowling alley and give it a try, and base my decision to partake on how it felt; if it caused obvious pain or strain, I would quit. The clinic's recovery guidelines say to let pain be your guide to activity—if it causes pain of more than two on a scale of 10, don't do it.

At the bowling alley, I held the 3.5 lb. ball in my hand, and it felt easy, like it had no weight at all. I bowled a few frames and felt absolutely fine. So I decided to continue, believing the activity to be safe. I bowled two games, totaling 60 throws of the ball. I did not feel any pain at the time, so assumed I was fine.

But two days later, while at work, I noticed my hands and wrists felt ""off""—the joints had suddenly stiffened up and become much harder to move across the keyboard than they had been a few days before. Overnight, the improvement in the condition of the joints resulting from the treatment had been lost, and they were now in worse shape than before. As the day went on, I had a nasty whole-body flare, the likes of which I hadn't had in years.

Over the next few days, it became apparent that the bowling incident had caused massive, body-wide joint damage, directly proportional in severity to the degree a given joint was used in bowling. I had severely miscalculated the risk. Each throw of the ball had caused joint damage too subtle to detect at the time, but that added up in a big way. 

The bowling incident completely botched my second stem cell procedure and caused fresh, raw damage to many of the joints involved. Thankfully, and serving as further evidence of how well the treatment works, the joints treated in 2017 held up better, I guess because the repair tissue in those joints time to mature before I \*\*\*\*ed them up again. I am now back to being in deplorable condition overall. I'm in significant pain every day that interferes with my ability to work and do the things I want to do. 

I need another stem cell procedure. The total price tag to treat all the joints I want will be $65,000. I have about $50K of that, and it's going to be \*\*\*\*ing hard to save the rest.

I returned to the clinic in September to get my bone marrow aspiration for another round of stem cell injections. We just got the results back. My 2019 bone marrow sample yielded only 40% as many stem cells as my 2016 sample. Because the cells grow exponentially, this means I will only have a tiny fraction of the final cell count I had to work with previously, which means we don't have enough cells to move forward regardless of finances. So this is my new permanent condition. 

Because I went bowling. Because I was not assertive enough to excuse myself from a social situation when I knew there was a risk. Because I wasn't smart enough to recognize the danger or bowling. Because I was irresponsible. 

I won a Darwin award.

15,"I know I shouldn’t be thinking about children at 22 years old but I can explain my fears. When I was 17, my brother had his first born. Cutest boy I’ve ever seen on the planet. Months later, my older sister had her first born son. In the waiting room, my mother *jokingly* asked me and my younger sister “who is having the next grandchild”. I was 17 and my younger sister was 15. We weren’t even old enough to answer!

Now, my brother and sister in law have three sons. My older sister only has her first born. But I’m scared to have children because I have been no contact with my family for a few months now. I’m afraid if I make any progress in my life (engagement, marriage, child bearing...) my estranged family will make it their issue and try to take it over from me.

Should I be scared of having children? Or is my anxiety amping up all the scenarios in my head?",17Nov2019,1
16,"This is probably going to be the stupidest post on this sub, and I haven’t written here before, but I really need to talk about this somewhere. And I don’t know where else to go. 

I(m18) began identifying as bisexual when I was about fourteen years old. And I have since. At the time, I still identified as female. (I’m transgender, FTM, that is 100% for sure, so please don’t try to debate that) And I knew for sure that I belonged in the LGBT community, I wasn’t straight. And so, the title bisexual soon came to mind. I always have thought girls were pretty, and I had some crushes(or not, I’m questioning it now) on girls as a young child. 

Now that I’m older, I’ve dated quite a bit. Mostly guys. Relationships with girls just don’t feel right, at all. I don’t feel as intensely and I just am not the same. I just don’t like them as much. Even if I think they are pretty, I like their personality and everything it’s not the same. The times I have been sent things such as nudes I just haven’t really felt much about it. I mean, it’s nice that they want to show me. But still. It just, doesn’t feel right.

Recently, I have been beginning to debate if I just think they are pretty and like their personality so I constitute that for romantic feelings that aren’t truly there. For a while I was worried that I may just believe this because certain girls I dated / liked weren’t the beat to me. But I have dated far worse guys, and I never questioned liking them. 

I don’t see myself ever spending my life with a girl. But I don’t know if it’s just social conditioning and it’s normal to feel that way? I mean, I also don’t wanna be one of those guys who pretend to be bi because they don’t want to fully come out as gay, but I honestly don’t know.",17Nov2019,1

18,"I am about to be 25, I have never had a girlfriend or sex. I will be spending my birthday and all of the upcoming holidays alone. I even have a surgery I have to go through and recover from alone. I dont really do anything besides go to work, watch random videos, listen to music, cook, eat, sleep, and get ready for the next day. I have no motivation to do anything, I havent really done anything this whole year since the last woman I was seeing. I have just gone to doctors appointments, I never even took a vacation, I havent in years anyways. I dont even mean anything expensive, Ive never done that anyways, I mean I literally have been basically going to work and sleeping for a majority of this year.

I swipe right on dating apps all the time and dont get matches. I have no way of meeting women because apparently dating apps are the ONLY way to meet women. If this is what life has come down to then I really am worthless. 

I have friends, both men and women, that I see every few weeks or months or text here and there. I have done all those stupid recommendations that guys always get, dress better, get a hair cut, work out and gain weight, etc. I have been doing all of that for years and women dont care. When I talk to people I am pretty formal and respectful to the point I apologize a lot.

Compared to my friends who just exist and have women flirting with them. If I try to start a conversation with someone, anyone, I get a ""ugh why are you talking to me?"" Vibe from them. I really hate myself, after all the horrible dating experiences I have had, being so many women's back up guy that was always just so gullible and believed everything they said. Watching an ex friend be with the woman I cared so much about, all while she treated me like shit when we went out on dates.

Now Im going to hear all this bs about I shouldnt date and to let life happen and to work on myself even more. Screw that honestly, I was never good enough, no amount of working on myself will make a woman leave a guy for me, there wont ever be a woman who is crazy about me and makes another guy the back up option. I will never know what its like to be with that woman who was with my ex friend, or any of the other women who treated me similarly. I will never know what its like to be with someone in college, what its like to be with an attractive early 20s woman. I will never know what its like to experience relationships and sex with someone who is inexperienced like me.

I will never get to have multiple relationships or sex partners in my life like everyone else did. I have been told I am the guy women settle for in their 40s and I never want to be that guy. I dont want to be the guy that finishes last and ends up with someone who got everything she ever wanted and was with multiple guys all while I was always alone my entire life. Its not like anyone will ever want me anyways.

I truly hate myself, I am so worthless, I was never good enough and never will be for women. I will never be like that ex friend, I will always remember that they both made me look like the dumbest piece of shit ever by randomly denying to me they had no feelings for the other despite me never asking about that. I guess I am just here so that women can have a back up option,to know that they could always do worse. 

I just wish I could live in the middle of nowhere away from everyone. Let everyone be with who they want, I just feel like the most worthless piece of shit in the world. I feel embarrassed for people who have to look at me, thats probably why I apologize so much.",17Nov2019,1

Well, it’s always the little things that impact your “mood” ig? Psychology says for example, the way you dress influences how you feel for example, don’t like your clothes? Odds are you’re gonna feel sucky about it IDFK lmao I’m just ranting at this point 

Anyways, so one thing they did at boot camp at least to me is, the first day we were getting our uniforms issued they gave me a WAYY too big size. I told them my size and they were like “nope” they had us put it on and said, “if anyone has any problem with their cammies come up now” (hint: no one was supposed to go up) my dumbass went up and was like “sir, my cammies are too big “ and he answered “it’s fine. You’ll grow into them” (I was like uhhh fuck no) well. Over the next few months I got so fat.. 

Anyway, I had the same size up until now. Today I went and got a new pair. The ones at boot camp were a medium regular and my actual size was a small long etc. dude holy fuck with my old ones I just looked like a blob lmao hella baggy and shit and with the new ones it’s such a huge difference.

Yes, I am aware that I do not know him that much even if he has a 50 fact video about himself, and that made me keep asking myself why I wanted to be friends with him.

I don't know if you guys had felt the same thing as I did, if you follow any lowkey youtubers out there. There was a point that I sent him an appreciation message on Instagram two weeks ago but I wrote there that there was point that I wanted to be friends with him. It sounds like I am being a creep to him and not knowing that establishing connections online is risky and it will be deemed as creepy, but I couldn't help but to write that in the message as well. He hasn't replied nor read to it though but I have a feeling he put restrictions on me or put me in his general inbox. Right now, he is already blowing up and he already has like 8,270 now. Not gonna lie, I am proud of him that he is blowing up but I sometimes wish that I can hang out with him. Oh well, these feelings of wanting to be friends with him, I am letting it pass because it is already taking a toll on my emotional state. I always keep saying to myself whenever I think about it that I am just his viewer at the end of the day which does help on my emotional well being. I am sorry to anyone reading this because I sound like a weirdo on this post, I just need to vent this out. 🙏

48,"Here is where ill start. It all started when i was 5, well, what I remember. The first fight I witnessed was my dad having a big fight with my mom because of me. I was about to go to first grade, but i was ""too young"" and my mom still fought the school and my dad fought with my mom and didn't want her to do that. It was really stupid. At the time I had 3 siblings. Well, my older sister, she was about 9 years old, my brother, 6 years old. He hit us all (And my mom). well after that he fought and hit and fought. I have too many memories of them fighting. I would cry all the time. 

There was a fight where my dad threw class on the floor, and it went inside my moms leg. She was sitting on the floor crying and screaming and I was looking at her. I froze. I didn't do anything. I was just crying. She crawled to the phone and called the ambulance. (my mom started it) (And she called the police)

(Not a fight, but when me and my siblings found out he cheats on my mom.) I was 7 and a half, he was sitting behind a glass, he was on his phone, me and my siblings were laughing. (It's ground floor, we had to floors)We went outside and looked he was talking to A BUNCH of girls. (just for sex) and then he noticed us and looked behind him and ""tricked us"" and said it was just a virus.

The other fight i remember,I was around 7, it was june, and they fought (Probably about my dad cheating on her) (he always does) he fought her hit her blah blah and I know why I remember that fight, it was because i was (Also my siblings were) pulling him and yelling ""DON'T HIT HER PLEASE"" He said ""I WON'T! LET ME GO!"" and he pushed me down i fell, then he started apologizing and left. (My mom called the police)

There was this fight. It was years later we were in another house, I was 10. (I had 6 siblings) That was the first time I got a clue that he was drinking. At the time they were divorced but never ever told us (They divorced 2 years before that), we found out on our own. My dad and mom got in a fight, it was odd because they weren't in a fight for a while. And my mom started the fight while talking about money. Later on she started shouting to my dad for a while even though he was in another room, then he got pissed off (And was drunk)  And my mom shut her door and my dad went forcefully  banging the door and tried pushing it to open it. All of us kept pushing him back. My big sister called the police and my mom went to the front door and they asked for my dad to come to them and my was mom and my bigger sister were saying he is surely drinking I can smell him. That's when i got the idea.

Now, im 13, my dad is an alcoholic that is a ""*Sexaholic*"". My mom keeps going. And coming. That is my life. I hope I don't turn out like them.",17Nov2019,1

56,"Hi, not all too sure what I'm wanting to get out of posting this, but here goes.

So I(28M) went out with a workmate(36M) Saturday evening. Now he's married with 2 kids, and I've been single for a long time. I'm a very quiet person pretty much always, and I generally don't much if anything to say. We were sat at a table, just drinking and chatting, workstuff, easy topic. After a while this group of girls starts dancing in the open floor by our table. One of them however was particularily attractive to me, right height, dressed nice, great smile etc. The guy I was with knew I was eyeing her, and I wanna say she was eyeing me too every so often, but I don't think she was. He kept egging me on to go approach her, they had already asked if they could leave their coats on the end of our seats, but I just couldn't go do it. No amount of drunkedness would ever give me the courage to go approach anyone. I do not dance, I really dislike small talk, and it usually takes me a while to warm up to people. Usually my aim when I go out is to either get really drunk or to find a girl. Now neither go well because it also seems to take me a lot to get drunk, and tbh I don't really like alcohol, but like the drunk feeling. Found that I like strawberry daiquiri, and some ciders.

On to the next part. This night ended early for me. After about 5 drinks, we were going to go off to another bar, which is no problem. But the bar we were going towards was closing very shortly, so my friend and another workfriend(M20) we joined up with suggested going to a club. This is where I put my foot down, I don't want to ever set foot into a club. Done it once, and never again. So it all ended very early, with them two going into the club, and me walking home practically sober. I considered going back into the first bar which is familiar to me, and I have been in there on my own before. I just felt too down/annoyed to do it, though I don't think that was because of my friends.

So yeah, like said I don't know what I want to get out of this. But, I feel like my main goals of me going out is to find a girl. Whether it's for something casual, or an actual relationship, I'd be happy. But I don't think that the girl I want would ever go to bars or whatever, if I go maybe once a month or so, then that makes the chances of me finding that right person just so abysmally low. I'm quite possibly am just in all the wrong places. I use PoF, post on r4r, have a Tinder. Maybe one day something good will come my way.",17Nov2019,1

58,"1st time posting so just gonna go straight to the point. Today i told my girlfriend about how jealous i am with one of our guy friend that is friendly and likes to talk to all our female friends. Hes not a bad person, i dont hate him. But today when my gf and i were discussing about her granpa's birthday and what to give him, she mentioned him and said that he should come too. Now this made me really mad but kept my cool and ended the phone call calmly. But then i kept thinking about it and then called her back, told her that he could take her instead of me. And  now my gf is mad at me for thinking that way and told me that it was just a friendly gesture and the ""guy's"" house was not far from her granpa's. Then i felt bad for making her mad and apologized. I really want to fix myself guys, i want to control my emotions more properly. The guy sits behind my gf at class and me a few feet on her left. They have fun in class and it really freakin hurts, not that i dont want her to have fun, it still hurts if she gives attention to other males. She apologized and said it wont happen again. Now i dont want to be a controlling person, i dont want to tell people what they should do or dont, and i hate myself for getting jealous and being insecure. On the other hand, my gf said that my jealousy means i really like her and that its natural and common. But for me its not that simple, to me it seems that i am insecure as fuck and i think too much. Ive read that jealousy is actually a negative thing in a relationship and shouldnt be seen as ""cute"" or adorable. So should i break up with her or continue the relationship, cuz now i feel like a lesser man than the guy and my gf would be better off with a guy like him who is more confident and charismatic. I feel like such a loser right now. I want to control my feelings and emotions guys. I really want to fix myself but i dont know how.

gotta interrupt - she just whispered “this isn’t mine” in her sleep. Out of 3 hours of pure silence. Psychological warfare? Guilt for being on a side that isn’t hers? No one can know for sure. 

- anyway, I’ll grab her wrist whenever it is pushed onto me and try to guide it back to a comfortable position for me but she puts ALL of her strength into it somehow. 

I put my pillow on the foot of the bed earlier and got a little bit of sleep upside down but I think I’m awake for the day at this point. Plus her feet are somehow more active than her arms and she would creepily slither her feet under my neck whenever I would get comfortable. 

Her phone chimed at one point and she instinctively reached for it but her arm just kind of flailed and hit me in the stomach.

there i was minding my own GODDAMN BUSINESS in the shower and then i see this huge ass daddy long legs on the INSIDE OF THE SHOWER DOOR. IN THE SHOWER. WITH ME. FUCK.

it was at like the top of the shower door so i judged it was safe enough to kick the door open so it rested against the wall, so that the spider could GET OFF MY FUCKING SHOWER DOOR AND LEAVE ME ALONE and i was muttering ""get out get out get out get out"" with my fucking dick shrivelled up in fear so much i felt like i was gonna be -2 inches

and then i fucking lost him and sang ""where did you come from where did you go where did you come from cotton eyed joe."" does fear turn me into a theatre kid? who the fuck knows. anyway i stopped what i was doing until i spotted the fucker so i knew it was safe to continue showering. i lost sight of him two more times after that, and each time i fucking FROZE and went into EMERGENCY SPIDER SPOTTING MODE fucking staring up and down and left and right, peering out of the shower door to make sure he hadn't come back.

when i was done i got my towel, dried myself, took a moment to recover from the LIFE THREATENING ORDEAL that i just went through, walked out covering myself with the towel like i was ashamed that this fucking SPIDER had seen me naked. and i said ""thank you for letting me live"" after i got my clothes on and escaped. in english, that time. i don't know how to say it in japanese.

She has decided to keep up his vindictive legacy and wont give me or my brother a dime out of it because she doesn't like us or our mom, despite us being his actual biological kids. Him and his girlfriend spent their whole lives hiding money from the government by keeping it in the girlfriend's name and accounts, or in liquid cash (because my dad received disability checks and didnt want to lose them by showing economic viability). I'm a college student scraping money from nothing, my brother is living with my mom who has no home and has to live with my uncle while looking for government housing. The girlfriend is left with a 5 bedroom house for her and her two kids and the 100k insurance payout. Is there any kind of fund for children whose parent committed suicide? He graciously left us bio kids as the executor of the estate so basically we get to throw away his trash and sell his rusty car for dirt and gain next to nothing despite all the work, while his girlfriend got the handout that was meant to be work-free money to help his family cope with the loss. I wish we could have split the 100k between everyone he left behind but their choices roadblock that. Does anyone know any way I can make this into something better?

when i look at pictures of ground zero (before the clean up started), i see barely any steel left. 

there were over 200 floors between both buildings and 200,000 tons of steel - thats 400,000,000 lbs of un-meltable metal. that is such an enormous weight, and looking at pictures, it looks like 10 stories of the twin tower remained, and the other 90+ floors all turned to dust.

This new adventure is something that once was just a thought in my mind. I still cannot believe that this is actually going to happen. Am I happy? Very much so. These people are very special to me. They really looked out for me long ago when I truly believed the world did not care. I am a very loyal and devout person. All that I ask is that all third parties respect my privacy and wishes just as I respected your dignity and your privacy. Just as I was concerned about your plight and well being, I ask that you show concern for my own and allow me to go in a direction (without drama) that will bring me the most happiness.  

As some of you may know, I have embraced the Constitution Party. It's taken me years to realize this, but America is a great gift to the world. I don't think we're better than anyone or that we should tell people what to do. We should act as sources of illumination when the situation requires it, but also be willing to sit down and receive criticism. America is is the new kid on the block. We've been spared the suffering of the Russian Christians and the tribulations of the Islamic world. Yes, I do respect and care about the Muslims very much. Also the Jewish and everyone else.

While the Republicans launch various ideological wars on various domestic issues in pursuit of their belief to protect America, they continue to keep American youth in the Middle East among all that instability that is a direct result of meddling in foreign cultures and affairs.

For those of you who mock this stance as foolishly sentimental, heavy is the head that wears the crown. When the son spoke these words it sent me into a deep thinking process but I did not know what it truly meant. I do now. Do not come down this path. You'll lose yourself if you lack the internal strength. It's a permanent and extensive loss.  

My main playground was PressTV. For being depicted as extremists and hateful Muslims, these people gave me a great deal of freedom to speak my mind. I am eternally grateful for this. At one point, I insulted Donald Trump's wife and the Muslims were very upset and made it known that they did not want that sort of behavior around them. It was a great lesson for the man. While he insults Muslims and blames them for American woes, they prohibit insults against those Trump calls family. They have assisted U.S. National Security in a significant manner. Many people do not know this.

I find Islam to be an interesting thing. It presents an overwhelmingly specific set of commands on how to treat wives. Many American men just abandon their wives and leave them without nothing. Islam specifically prohibits this. Husbands get mad and hit the road. The Quranic method requires a bit more thought and calm demeanor which is very refreshing. I always thought it odd that women who conceive children are then treated like trash though they have entirely invested themselves into the matter. 

Anyway. What's the next step? That's what I'm hoping to resolve. There is no direct route there that I know of.  And I'm trying to avoid any new situations involving great potential for drama.",17Nov2019,1

87,"Im at a point where I just dont know what to do. I haven’t felt this low in a while, probably the last time I felt this bad (suicidal thoughts, feeling emotionless, not wanting to do anything at all) was when I was about 12 years old and I’m 16 now. Something might be wrong with me I guess, a mental health problem or something, but I don’t want to admit that to myself or mostly my parents. I hate school, my friends don’t go to the same school me and I have people I can talk to in classes but no one that I’m close with. I get anxious doing the most basic things like going to school, because I’m transgender and live in constant fear of people finding out and ostracising me. I hate my body so much that I can’t look in a mirror, or do things like go for a job interview (I really need money, something else that contributes to always feeling awful because I’m slowly running out of funds for myself). Like I said the last time I felt this bad I was around 11 or 12 and felt better when I started to dress more masculine, got a male haircut etc. There’s nothing I can do now. I just exist in constant sadness, trying to give off the image that I’m fine so people don’t worry about me. This is so embarrassing, I’m aware of that, and really ashamed - but there’s literally nothing else I can do. I’ve heard talking helps and this is as close as I’ll ever get. Just looking for advice or something, i dont know. Feel like an idiot now",17Nov2019,1
88,"My last grandma died. I was lucky when I was born I was lucky enough to have 3 grandmas. Over the years they passed away. Recently my last Grandma who I was least closet to passed away.

89,"Basically I realized a year or two ago that my head shape was getting really bad. Neither of my parents have ever said anything about why this is happening, never even mentioned it once. Ive seen pictures of me when i was younger &amp; yea i had a weird head but it still looked somewhat normal growing up, but as I get older and my head shape defines its showing worse and worse.

People probably think im overreacting so let me explain. Im not gong to post picture for my own sake. Basically one side of my head did not grow out as the other side has. My orbital bone (temple bone around the eye socket) has stunted growth, as well as the skull around the whole right side of my head &amp; my jaw. Its so bad that my left ear looks like its growing out of my neck. It looks like i slept on my right side and it dented my whole face in. On top of that my jaw on my left side is uber defined and looks beautiful, so it makes the non defined kid-like jaw on my right side look 10x worse and noticeable. when i line my nose up straight up and down, my whole right side looks like ive had a stroke and is slanted. The right side is also pushed farther back than my right and my bone under my eye is also pushed back so my face literally looks dented. My face and head constantly hurts as everything is growing around these bones and pulling on them. Constant headaches, and Im scared my brain is going to not grow in right and cause a stroke/seizure (possibly while sleeping, while laying on my side).

just google hemifacial microsomia or mild parry romberg and youll kinda see what i look like. alot of the pics are really bad but I still have an ear so look for those.

Idk how I never realized it growing up (i think i subconsciously did because I always wore hats, hated picturues and what not), but as soon as i did realize what i was dealing with it killed my confidence and self esteem extremely bad and i became fixated on it.

I started doing research online and even though I dont know exactly what caused it, apprently its very rare. From what ive read it could be hemifacial microsomia, or parry romberg disease, or just a stunted skull growth, or all of them honestly, i cant narrow it down. my mom has skin tags that would link it to parry romberg but my skull also has a soft spot 'line' across the top, meaning possible skull deformity.

I dont exactly know what to do at this point because nobodys ever said anything to me or even taken me to see a doctor growing up to talk about it. Even now when i subtly hint at it, they just say ""idk have you asked the doctor?"". And no I havent yet, but this shouldve been addressed when i was alot younger by my PARENTS, which is fueling alot of bad thoughts towards them because i just get aggrevated that theyve never thought anything of it.

this is kind of me venting now, but how do I go about this? How do I bring this up to them? Do they just not want to see whats wrong here? Anyone else gone through a similar situation? I have no one to talk to about this. Friends just dont mention it like im retarded and their trying not to bring it up. any response helps.

100,"Two years ago, my partner of one year left me. 

In the months that followed I was convinced that life after love was not living. It had been too bland in comparison to the life I had with him. A year after he left, I started dating again but every man I encountered was ... I don’t know how to describe it but here’s an analogy: love was a drug and he was my first hit, and every hit after him just did not give me the same high. 

I had become comfortable with the idea that I was never going to encounter anyone as great as him and that I should just be grateful for the love that I did experience with him. With this belief, I immersed myself into the casual dating lifestyle. 

But I met someone recently. I feel butterflies when he texts me. Every time I get a notification, I hope it’s him. Talking to him makes me feel like I’m walking on sunshine. Goodness, I think I have a crush on him. I experience a high off of his presence and his company and I also experience withdrawals in his absence. 

Y’all, I think I have a crush. 

...
If I could write to the heartbroken child that I was two years ago, I’d tell her:

Dear 20 year-old HopefulLotus, life after love is worth living. You’ll do so many new things and meet so many new people who fill the hole he left in your heart. You’ll experience types of joy you didn’t even know existed. You will feel the butterflies again. You will walk on sunshine again, I promise. Until then, one foot in front of the other baby girl. Don’t stop, you’ll make it out the tunnel of grief. I promise. Baby steps if you have to but just don’t stop.",17Nov2019,1

She's so beautiful, she's funny, she's smart, she's kinky, the whole package 

We've been spending a lot of time alone together, I like to make her smile and laugh and it seems like she likes to hang out with me

I asked her to be my gf and she said no because she doesn't want a relationship because a ton of past relationships were really fucking shitty for her, but we still talk a lot and hang out and shit and I still want her to be my gf so I've been trying harder to get her to like me more and say yes and it's been working a bit 

I keep getting really insecure that she doesn't really like me and will never see me as more than a friend because tbh, I'm not very attractive, my personality isn't perfect, and my voice is kinda gross. It's kinda deep, kinda gravelly, extremely monotone, kinda nasally, and I always sound kinda stuffy

102,"Hi, I'm a freshman in college who's pretty much settled on taking a leave of absence from school next semester, but doesn't know what to do during a leave. I feel super burned out from work, and I'm not really involved in much here. The clubs that I thought would interest me didn't, so I have no motivation to participate in any of them and I find it difficult to join new clubs this late into the semester.
More broadly, I feel like I don't even know what interests me anymore. I don't really have hobbies, I don't really know if I still wanna pursue the major I thought I would, and I'm not as interested in the stuff that used to interest me like watching movies or reading. I feel like I’ve become a very bland person who doesn’t even know what he wants and has nothing that inspires them. All this makes it hard for me to connect with other people over shared interests, which sort of leads into my next and biggest problem:
I feel like even though I have “friends” but I'm not really close to any of them. Everyone around me seems to have formed friendships while I'm sort of on the outside of it all: I'm friendly with people but they are closer with other people, and they hangout/make plans without me. I'll admit, a part of may just be that I didn't really reach out enough or be as social as I could have been. But still, this really concerns me since I felt the same way in high school and was hoping that college would be different. But it's just more of the same, and I'm worried that at the end of four years I'm just gonna be feeling disappointed, as full of regrets, and as out of touch with my peers as I felt at the end of high school.
All these problems have been recurring for a couple years now, but I feel like they are at their breaking point. I really just want a break from school, where I can hopefully figure out what genuinely motivates me, become better at reaching out to others, and honestly just recharge. Problem is, I'm not sure what I can do during my leave of absence that will accomplish all of this. Does anyone who's taken a leave/knows someone who has have any suggestions? I know this is super late to make plans but I really need this break and I’m really lost on ideas. Thanks in Advance!",17Nov2019,1

105,"I went to a medical call the other day, I pulled into the driveway right behind another cruiser, the fire department was in route but not there yet.

I immediately jumped on and started compressions and started the aed. I felt this women’s sternum and ribs breaking underneath me. The daughter was obviously hysterical, screaming “you need to save her she’s the only one I have left”. Fire arrived and did medical for 20 minutes before they stopped. I had to go to the neighbors house where the daughter went to, and tell her that her mother had passed. First time I was exposed to something like that and it was really awful.

108,"Hello,

So, I've been looking at a few posts on dating or seduction. Most of these posts are geared towards using tactics that don't actually work. All you have to do is be a human being, how hard can that be?

Women, can spot a guy pretending to be someone he isn't There's a difference between being anxious on a date and just being an idiot.

I understand that sure, anxiety will most definitely kick in. Everyone has anxiety when it comes to doing something that they cannot predict the outcome of it. But more often than not, anxiety is a distortion of an event that hasn't even happened yet, so you're fearing the worst.

99.9% none of the scenarios that your anxious brain will come up with to deter you, will actually happen. With that out of the way, you don't have to implement any of these tactics that you see on shows, or read up on articles on ""how to pick up women""

All you have to do is to not force yourself into being somebody else , that's it. In doing so, this will free up more space in your head, so it won't be taken up with worry or thoughts of should i do this, or that. Just let things happen as they happen.

Sure, don't be an idiot, be polite, courteous. Open door's women, or at a restaurant, pull out their chair for them to sit down on. I admit, i am an old fashioned guy.

Pay them compliments, but don't over do it, as you don't want to come across as creepy. Make them laugh, crack a few jokes. Hell, tell embarrassing stories about yourself so she will see that you're comfortable in your own skin. Women love a guy who knows who he is, and owns it.

Just be interesting, think of it as a job interview, you'll want to put in the best possible light.

Remember, to have good hygiene, no one wants their date to turn up smelling like a dumpster truck. Also, if you're struggling to make conversation, listen to what they are saying to you, then go off that. Don't speak about your self too much, as you'll come off as self centered.

As i said before with regards to hygiene, wear cologne just a dab, too much &amp; it acts as a repellent, just the right amount is pleasant. Also, wear well fitted clothing, so it extenuates your figure.

Stand tall, have a good posture. You can command an entire room with just how you enter it. People will notice it, even if you don't. Not all dates will go according to plan, it just means it wasn't your time. Keep getting out there, you'll find someone who you click with it will be effortless &amp; not like pulling teeth.

I think the key to being attractive, regardless of your physical appearance is the impression that you leave on a person.People gravitate towards positive behavior, people who are fun to be around. As it boosts the serotonin, endorphin &amp; dopamine levels in not only your brain but theirs too.",17Nov2019,1
110,"Before I get into this, I want to say that nothing about this post is humble, and I will sound extremely conceited. I'm not sure how to talk about this openly without it coming across as bragging, so I apologize in advance for being a total ass.

This is what I consider my undeserved success: Two years ago, I graduated with a degree in pure math with a 4.0 GPA and was accepted into graduate studies instantly. During this time, I sent out a single job application and got an internship first try, with a single interview. In fact, the company I worked for hired me back the following summer, even though I did barely any work.

I know of the concept of imposter syndrome, but I really feel like an imposter. I have serious work ethic and procrastination issues. At my job, I often spent entire weeks doing literally nothing but browsing reddit even though I had work to do, and no one ever called me out. In class, I do every assignment the night before it's due (often pulling all-nighters), and I often feel too lazy to study for my exams. For two classes in my last semester, I literally did not study at all, and they were not easy courses.

But the problem is that I never learn my lesson. In a weird masochistic way, I want to fail. I want the universe to slap my in the face, but it doesn't happen. Somehow, I've managed to get an A or A+ in every course I've taken, whether or not I feel like I deserved it, because I really don't think I do. I've failed exams, and then manage to get an A anyway, probably due to a low class average.

I feel terrible about it, because I've barely worked for any of it. There are thousands of people around me who put in more effort, are more professional, understand the material better, and aren't rewarded to the extent I am. Some of you reading my post right now are rolling your eyes, and I don't blame you. No really, I mean it, I feel like a fucking ass.

So why am I typing this up? Right now, it's reading week for me... well it's the end of reading week. I have two very large assignments due tomorrow and Tuesday and I haven't started on them even though I've had 7 days off. I fucking hate myself for it, but I'm so broken at this point that part of me doesn't give a shit. Part of me knows that I'll panic at 11pm tonight, force myself to work through the night and get it done, then tell myself ""I'm never doing this again"", and get 95+% on the assignment anyway and go straight back to my old habits.

I read some academia subreddits, and I feel physical discomfort when hearing about the struggles of other students. They put so much work into their classes and the universe just shits on them while I do nothing and get sprinkled with success. I guess ""life isn't fair"", but what the hell am I to do?",17Nov2019,1

113,"I remember as a kid being excited to possibly get facial or body hair when I get older...it just seemed really masculine, hairier guys seemed to be generally the most respected, and women were attracted to hairy men...but unfortunately, it never came. And then I look back at my male family members, and they don't have it either. And I feel pretty devastated.

I haven't worn shorts or gone to a swimming pool or beach for years just because I'm ashamed of my hairless body. Most of my body hair is just short fine hairs you can barely see, like the ones a child would have, with the only noticeable parts being a bit of armpit hair, but not as much compared to other guys, and some pubic hair, which is usually kept hidden anyway.

And as such, it especially hurts to see women, both online (askwomen and such) and in real life, absolutely swooning over facial and body hair, and using really harsh descriptions to describe how much they hate hairless guys: ""It reminds of a child!"", ""Hairless men do nothing for me!"", ""I want a man, not a boy!""

Some general advice to try to boost facial and body hair growth seems to be to work out more, eat more meats, and avoid things like soy...which I'm been doing, but to no avail.",17Nov2019,1

121,"i had a massive argument with an adult (who i’ll call person 1) i thought was around my age online for tweeting awful shit about me and my friend (person 2) because i couldn’t help cheer him up, and then claimed on twitter that i was harassing him when we messaged him to stop. i then decided to just block him realising he probably doesn’t have any personal info about us he could share and advised person 2 to do so too. from then on the discord server we owned was as normal. i went out with person 2 for her birthday along with her friend. a few days afterwards (and the day after my birthday) i went to check discord to find person 2 had banned me from the discord server and blocked me on every platform, i realised when i was in school later that she also skipped any classes she sat near me in. i was obviously not holding up that great as person 2 was my closest friend and i trusted her with all my heart then she just gets rid of me that easily. the day after i’m in my house, really feeling like shit and trying to figure out what happened. i let my emotions get the best of me and i made another account and joined their server only to find ive been replaced by person 1 and he can read everything i’ve ever said in the server. person 2 obviously never cared about me as i saw the first text she sent in the server after banning me was to person 1 saying “anyway here are your roles”. i started to cry and immediately left the server. i couldn’t believe this had happened. this may same like nothing to anyone reading this but to me it was my worst nightmare. from then i blocked everyone in the server and tried to relieve stress by going to twitter for advice. while nobody replied to it, someone had seen it who was the last person i’d hope to have seen it, i only found out that saw it a couple days ago (2 months after tweeting it then deleting it the next day) after no conversations between us for those 2 months, i find 4 people joined my friends server (person 1, person 2, and 2 other people from the server i used to be friends with) and seemed to not notice me which i thought was good. yet two days ago person 1 kept getting banned from the server from spamming invite links to his server. i didn’t think much of it until my friend who owned said server messaged me saying “did you see what person 1 said before getting banned?” well he fucking texted my tweet. he’s had it saved and he’s using it as a copypasta. when i saw this i was ready to quit the internet altogether, i was probably overreacting a bit but i was straight back to rock bottom and just about ready to block everyone and everything out of my life. yesterday i didn’t hear anything from person 1, however i did hear from person 2’s friends (who i never actually interacted with that close before or after being banned) and they messaged me to check on how i’m doing recently. i lied to them and said i was fine (thinking it was a joke of some sort to get another copypasta out of me). then i asked a few questions hoping to catch them out, but they seemed really sincere and i began to trust them quite quickly. i found out that person 2 is the only person who actually like person 1, and that person 2’s friends only put up with person 1 for person 2. when i mentioned that it’s unfair on them they disagreed so to me it’s obvious person 2 is manipulating them and they are under her control. after talking some more they seemed actually glad that i was doing fine (which i actually wasn’t). they then asked me to delete all the messages so that person 1 &amp; 2 doesn’t see. since then i’ve seen my tweet being sent by person 1 more timed than i can count. i got used to this as there’s nothing i could do about it but what broke me enough to write this is seeing someone i don’t know, on a completely different server, with no relation to person 1 or 2 text my tweet to the server. my friend (the one who first pointed out when person 1 sent my tweet) asked them about it and they just said that they saw it somewhere and thought it was funny so they reposted it. idk where the fuck they saw it, but all i know is an adult is trying to push me to kill myself and has nearly become successful multiple times. i also saw he posted in a server i’m in calling me a “filthy ugly rat”. i don’t know what i’ve done to deserve this, i don’t know what they want from me, and i don’t know if there’s anything i can do to stop all this. on top of my huge stress at home and at school this is making me wanna slip in to a coma for a few years. i don’t know how much longer i’m gonna be harassed for or how severe the stuff they’ll do will get but i’m fucking scared. i’m holding back tears and i don’t know what to do. i don’t wanna kill myself for various reasons (including being scared of failing and my family) but i’ve seriously been having suicidal thoughts on and off for two months straight and this shouldn’t be happening at this age. i should be living carelessly like everyone else in my school is doing. i should be happy. but so many things make it so i can only be sad.",17Nov2019,1
122,"You know... Sometimes I talk with people who really make me feel a sucker, and all ... But this happens rarely. 
Just to let you know, I just discovered that a girl I appreciate (esthetically at least, because I don't know her) on Instagram... It's 29 years old 😂 (oh well I'm 21 so... This would lead to a series of problems...). And... I'm not upset. Not. One. Bit. 
I previously commented under another INTP (poor us guys... We are really doomed to suffer I guess, without help at least 😅), to help him/her with his problem, and I felt good, as I expected of course, but... I want you to know that ... I love you. 
This is a mere community... It's poor of futile even if nice to look... Things (lies) like ig or snapchat... And maybe this is its power. But YOU, EVERYONE OF YOU. PEOPLE. GUYS. BOYS. GIRLS. LGBT WHATEVER YOU WANT TO BE. You ought to know that life is not so bad, it is not so shitty. And you HAVE to be nice to each other. YOU NEED to be nice, and need to receive love (that is not only kisses and sex). Observe the world around you, the ""normal"" life around you. There is the answer you are searching for. Good... I just want to try LSD...but I guess that you think I don't need acids do you? 😂😂😂
If there's some God, may he/she/it bless you all. May you do the best you have to be pacient, and good to the next, and may all the fortune invest you. 
I love you guys ❤️👣🕸️🌀🌈",17Nov2019,1
123,"I care about her as a person. I’ve been thinking about whether to do this for like 1.5 years. We had a wonderful open-hearted conversation, and she was very understanding. 

It went so good. I’m very happy. This has been weighing on me hard.",17Nov2019,1
