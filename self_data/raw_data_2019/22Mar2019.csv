5,"Hey kiddo.
I know you are going through the toughest time. But somehow you are managing it pretty well. You have a soul of a warrior. I know you have a broken heart, you try to be a great daughter, and be the hero you are born to be. 

There are others like you who are lost and it’s ok if you guide them back on a good path but you can’t save all of them. Give yourself time to heal and cry as much to let it go. 

Keep shining your soul to the world , you are worth more than you know. If he didn’t know it and keeps slipping away .. it’s ok. Your heart is mending it’s self. 
If your mom say you’re ungrateful , she doesn’t mean it, she is also hurting and seeking help. You’re nephew will look up to you like Deku does to All Might. That’s who you want to be. A hero.

Kid.. go out there and laugh, sing,  dance, draw, and save the world. That’s who you are.  I am rooting for you. And in time, someone will grab your hand and dance with you under the stars and never let go! 
 
Keep kicking ass.

6,"My boyfriend has this friend who’s a real ass. I don’t like him at all. It’s not even because of how he treats me, but the way he talks and acts and what he says and the things I hear about him in passing.

He thinks he’s so much better than everybody just because he’s got money from his moms inheritance and he’s never had to work for anything in his life. Even now at 20 years old, he stays home all day smoking weed and playing on his ps4. He lives with his 70 year old dad who takes care of everything and does all of the chores despite being hunchbacked and old.

The dude is selfish and thinks highly of himself and is ignorant of the world around him.

My boyfriend loves this dude. He thinks of him like his little brother. This guy and his dad took in my boyfriend when he got kicked out of his old place unexpectedly, and I thought he was really there for him. However, they kick him out without notice. The dude wouldn’t even let my boyfriend come into his house to pick something up; he just left it outside for him.

I don’t know. Maybe my boyfriend did something to piss them off, but he pays rent even when the dad tried to refuse his money, cleans up after the friend, and most of the time he isn’t even home - he’s working!

I know how much my boyfriend cares about his friend, and he doesn’t have many people in his life. I just warned him to keep an eye out for him, but he didn’t want to believe it. Now he’s homeless and friendless and no one will tell him what happened.

My heart hurts for him. I know what it’s like to have no friends in this world, but it’s so sad because my boyfriend really saw this dude as his brother. 

I didn’t want to believe it. I didn’t want to sabotage my boyfriend’s views on a dude he’s known since high school. But this dude just confirmed all of my suspicions.

I spent money on this guy. I got him a birthday cake and presents for the holidays. I treated him out to mini golf when he forgot his money. And yet he’s everything I hoped he wouldn’t be.

I’m not surprised, but I’m so disappointed. ",22Mar2019,1

8," Social media caught my attention when I figure out there are people out there would pay you 1k a month just to post on Facebook and Instagram twice a day.

Hi Folks I started building my personal brand In Jan of 2019 and planning to start a online marketing agency after 6-8 month in because I wanted to build enough rapport and social presence.

Surprising I was able to sign two clients for social media management ( which is basically posting on FB and Instagram twice a day) by DMing and commenting. I put together 16 tips to grow your social presence and hopefully this can help out some of you because personal branding gets real when you starts to see opportunity.

Well it turns out I didn’t study hard enough because I got a 67. I know that almost everyone failed, over half of my class failed.  But that doesn’t make me feel better. My grade went down to a 75.  18 whole points because of this stupid test.

I don’t want him to know that because I told him I do trust him and that’s the truth. I trust him, I just don’t trust other women and I know nothing about this girl. I don’t know if she likes him and would try to make a move. It sucks being long distance right now. Should I be worried or should I have faith in him that he won’t do or let anything happen?

Few minutes ago, I was responding to some post and I forget this very common english word (it's the word *opportunity*).
After trying to remember it for like 3 minutes straight, frustrated I say *""Screw it...""* and head right to Google translate.
I atomatically started typing. And what don't I see... For some reason I tried to subconsciously translate word *translate*.
I have a quick mind fart that goes something like *""Omg this is some quality stupid shit, I could post this to r/self and brag how stupid I am.""*
However after this mind fart, I instantly forget what word did I actually want to translate at the first place.

Oh the seat was a little small, the in-flight meal was *just ok*, and they charged *how much* for alcohol? Poor dear.  STFU. You're flying +600mph on a marvel of engineering that's safer than driving, miles in the sky. Sorry for the slight inconvenience for a few hours.

Try having to travel by Greyhound cross country for +30 hours multiple times. Changing busses at sketchy stations where good chance your bags will robbed if you don't keep an eye on them (Atlanta), no assigned seating, no or non functional charging ports, no in bus meals or drinks but what you and what others bring (you can tell by the smells) until a McDonald's or gas station break every few hours, nothing to do for the next 29½ hours after departing.  

Im reached a point in my life that I am able to fly places and internationally now. I've taken multiple roundtrips by Greyhound from Louisiana - Montana/Colorado/Baltimore/Chicago.

But i tried to come out to my parents, well actually my mom, that i was trans.(ftm if you curious) And when i did i expected them to have some sort of emotion, anger, sadness, approval, SOMETHING!

I guess i shouldn't have done that because before this they let me act and dress however i wanted, but now if we go to the store to buy my sister a dress for so occasion that's fast approaching my mom will force me into a dress saying ""oh look how pretty you look in that! We should buy that for you!"". And if i refuse to get in a dress she threatens me, she'll say that she'd take a away my phone or give away my poor doggies. I can't even get a hair cut.

28,"I'm two weeks out from my appendacitis surgery and everyone, especially my parents are being kinda mean about it. I really didn't want to do anything my spring break, just stay at home and try to rest after I forced myself to go back to school the Monday after I got released from the hospital on Friday. Instead, I've spent a lot of my break forcing myself to go out with my parents even when I let them know I just wanted to stay home. 

Last week was the hardest week of my whole life, trying to drag myself to classes while about to pass out from carrying my school bag was not ideal, and many of my friends were completely unsympathetic and uncaring. My grades are gonna drop this six weeks due to my fatigue and absence from class, it's probably gonna affect my class rank which I am quite proud of achieving. 

My parents got mad at me when I let them know that when I was out and about with them, I was extremely uncomfortable at times and just didn't want to move. My father has been micromanaging everything and completely disregards whatever pain I felt. My mother care too much (bless her) and won't leave me alone when I just want to think.

31,"I am a 19 year old male and have been going through a rather tough time emotionally as of late and have began to wonder of the issues I am having are things that everyone goes through or these are really unique Issue for someone of my age. 

I had a rough childhood, mother died at young age father became alcoholic, which made me rather reserved and made it very difficult for me to open up to people or trust people even up to this point in my life. I am going to be turning twenty in a week and can only say I have four friends those four friends are split into two groups of two and those groups have no interaction with one another. 

My first group I’ll call the Martial Arts (MA) group. MA is where my biggest issues come to play. One of my friends in MA is a male same age and he is like a brother to me and has been for nearly the last ten years. Although our upbringings were different from the outside looking in we shared very similar issues while growing up and this is a big part of why we became as close as we did. My other friend in MA is a girl ,17, and I have come to fall entirely head over heals for her. 

My first issue that I find my self in, and I suppose where I begin to ask the internet for there opinion, is if me being almost twenty and her being seventeen is to much of an age difference. I don’t personally find three years a big difference in age for two people but there is something about the seventeen to twenty age difference that feels like an issue to me. Maybe that is just my own mind which tends to overthink everything over thinking everything but I will leave it to the redditors reading this to answer. 

My second issue with the MA group is that the guy I consider a brother likewise has feelings for the MA girl. He has in the past given me the go ahead to try to get with her and that he would try to be happy for us. I however have been in the same situation as him and for as long as I have known him neither of have had the courage to actually tell the people whom we’ve had feeling s for that we have had feelings for them. So I know so well where he is coming from when he says go for it I will try to be happy for you. Any move I try to make with MA girl feels like I am stabbing my brother in the back. I am stuck between such a rock and a hard place and I suppose that is where I look for a second opinion from my fellow redditors, what would you do in my shoes?

In the past month or so I have been asking MA girl to go do things with me just the two of us contrary to the way that the three of us in the MA group had always done things together. Now I have always told the MA guy before hand though it has never been like I’m asking his permission simply telling him so I do not tell as though I am going behind his back with her. I have really been enjoying all of the time I have been spending with her. However every time I have asked her to do something I have made it seem like a casual thing on the outside. I don’t think I have ever made it seem like a date although it takes so much for me to work up the confidence to ask her it might as well be. I know that I undoubtedly have feelings for her but I am not sure that she reciprocates those same feelings towards me. 

Next weekend we are going to get dinner and she is going with me while I get a couple tattoos done. My brain which overthinks everything has decided that I need to say something to her before it entirely destroys my brain and heart. I have told MA guy that I plan to do this but this will be pushing me further out of my comfort zone than I have gone in probably five years. I’m scared that telling her how I feel will ruin the friendship that we have. I know what the best case scenario is. I know complacency is easier but being complacent isn’t going to work for me this time I need to know how she feels regardless of the outcome. 

The future scares me the potential of loosing the two most important people to me in the world scares me. They are more of a family to me than my family has been in years.

Last summer in my drunken escapades I slept with someone I wasn’t supposed to and subsequently ostracized myself from my entire group of friends. I fucked up majorly.

37,"My mum has depression, bipolar and a possible personality disorder. She’s an amazing woman; charismatic, funny, caring, stunning with the longest legs ever and incredibly socially intelligent. But when she switches; she’s terrifying. Her bad days were horrible. She was a single mum for most of my life. Boyfriends here and there but they would run when she would lose it. She’s thrown pieces of wood through windshields, thrown photo frames at people, broken ornaments on my feet, slapped me, pushed me, verbally abused me until I couldn’t do anything but freeze. She’s threatened to kill her self and me. My family tried to help but they couldn’t. She would threaten murder-suicide and they’d back off. 
16 years I dealt with watching her suicide attempts, hearing the abuse, feeling her anger and wondering why I deserved it. I was moved schools 6 times through my life; put into boarding schools and then I ran away for a bit. I never had friends because I was so isolated by her abuse; I still struggle keeping friends now because I’m always mentally ready that it’s not going to last. 

The last time I saw her when I was in high school was when I checked her into a psychiatric unit. She lunged at me screaming she was going to die there. I’d just turned 16. The night before she had started trying to cut herself in her bedroom; she flipped a knife drawer and ran into her room with a kitchen knife. 
On the day I checked her in, my uncle told me to toughen up. I’ve never spoken to him since. 
4 years went by, and I had her on block. She would scream abuse at me down the phone every time she called; it was really having a huge affect on me and my schooling. I’d ended up having a mental breakdown and running to the chaplain of my school confessing that I thought I wanted to die because I couldn’t take the guilt anymore. I ended up surviving and doing okay. 

It’s now 6 years later. I have an amazing job, an amazing husband and a beautiful life. I’ve tried to be close to her; but she ends up screaming at me basically saying that I’m trying to kill her and I’m punishing her for being a bad mother (manipulation as she denies everything). I asked her to come to my engagement party a while ago and she said she wanted nothing to do with it or my husband and that I was only getting married because I’m desperate for attention. Whack right? 

I’ve tried to open up with her about things that she’s done. She denies it and calls me a liar. I’ve called and confirmed a lot of the things I remembered. She remembers only what she wants to. I try to get close to her, but she pushes me away and still verbally abuses me. It’s her way or the highway. She doesn’t want me married, she wants me to move in with her - I’m 22 now and I’ve been living on my own for 4 years now. 

I want a mum. I want her to just love me for who I am, but I don’t think she does. I want her to understand that I’m not evil for staying away; I’m just protecting myself.  I’m mentally scarred; suffering severe anxiety because of what I’ve seen and what I’ve been put through. I’m a lot stronger than I was. 

I want my mum to be apart of my life. I just don’t know how.

This isn’t a life that I’m living. 

It’s gotten worse since college. I always thought it would get better once I was “in the real world” but it’s gotten so much worse. I could always rely on the “don’t let lying in this bed right now destroy your entire future” tactic to get myself to exams etc.

But I’m not looking forward to anything anymore so there’s nothing I can use for mental leverage. Plus in the real world you can’t just show up for the important stuff and no one is looking for friends anymore so the stress and loneliness is multiplied exponentially.

There’s all these cliches everyone always throws around “your brain is lying to you” “just try some more therapy and different medication” “but you have so much potential” etc. etc. I feel like my arm got bitten off by a shark and they’re suggesting I go to 7-11 and see if they have band-aids. 

Even if my depression cleared up completely forever tomorrow it could still take the rest of my life to dig myself out of the hole this disease has dug me. Hell even so the regret of everything I’ve already missed out on might be too much. I feel like I’m at a breaking point.

I’m in my mid-forties and have struggled with bouts of black, uncontrollable sadness since I was a teenager. It’s always been a feature of my life and those around me have tried to understand but it’s had its destructive effect from time to time. I’m not suicidal—not really—but I do think about it most days, just as an opportunistic way out if I ever needed one. 

Anyway, something happened a few weeks ago at work that really threw me off balance. A ‘therapist’—not qualified, just a member of some specious body of twats—ran a group session supposedly about work-life balance, but which degenerated into singling me out and asking me pointed questions about my state of mind in front of the group (‘so this must mean you have low self-esteem, yeah? And you must feel bad about that I bet’). I went home and cried, and have felt shaky and unsettled ever since. 

My employer runs its own counselling service so  in a moment of clarity/madness I made an initial appointment. For today. This morning. I am scared witless. I’m scared that this might make things a hundred times worse, that it might open up things that I can’t cope with and that there won’t be any support when that happens. But I feel like I have to do something. Maybe I’ll never feel better without it. I just don’t know. 

Anyway thanks for listening. Writing this has made me feel a little bit better at least. ",22Mar2019,1
56,"Note: I use the word “realize” a lot in this post. This is a short summery of the realizations I’ve had over the last four years, revelations resulting from one hell of a journey.

My dad was diagnosed with cancer the summer of my high school graduation. He was given three weeks to three months, it was severe. As a result, I postponed college and stayed with my family for another year. His health stabilized, so I went to college the following year.

I lived it up at college, finding people and doing things I had wanted since high school. The following summer, I went to another city away from my family to work, and returned to school in the fall. But when I returned, I realized I didn’t know what I was doing there. I didn’t want college, I didn’t want a degree, I had just wanted to run away from my family and live my own life, away from the cancer. 

So I ran away again, this time from college, and lucked into a great job away from both my college town and my family. I’ve spent the last year at this job.

But I’ve come realized the aimlessness of my last few years. I moved to this city with a girlfriend, who ended up sucking the life out of me. She became 100% dependent on me, emotionally, mentally, spiritually, financially. I knew the first step forwards was to break up with her. I did, and her reaction was to commit suicide. She failed (BARELY) but it made me realize that I’ve been surrounding myself with other people who are aimless. Like most of the people I’ve met, much of her pain was centered around a dysfunctional, broken family. People who are basically children with no goals, no ambitions, no sense of self worth or self preservation.

Watching her made me realize how much I miss my family. I realized how amazing my family is, how close we really are, and how much I miss them.

So I’m finally returning home. My dad is still going strong four years in. I have the combined college and work experience to get a good job. I have nothing keeping me here, and I have my family and friends back home. People who love me, people I’ve been avoiding for three years. I don’t know why it’s taken me this long, but I don’t regret the journey. Because the last three years have shown me how important these people are to me. Since leaving I’ve found nothing but broken people my age that have all cast themselves adrift, just like me. And I’ve realized that, at least from me, there’s nothing to run away from. 

So I’ve fired up the job search. I’ve let my family know. 

I’m finally returning home. ",22Mar2019,1
58,"So coming up next week I’ll be reaching two months without social media. Now to some, That doesn’t seem like a while and to others it seems like a long time. But to me, It seems like it hasn’t been long enough, Enough that I can finally stop thinking about it.

When I deleted them I was always asked “Why?”, Well... “I’m saving phone space”, “I have more time to be productive”or my personal favourite “I just got bored”
That’s what they would hear at least.

But the real reason, The Real honest reason why I stopped using it, Wasn’t because of all those three things above, But because I couldn’t handle the feeling of constantly being reminded that I’m alone.
Now it sounds silly I know. But bare with me and hear me out. Let me tell you why feel that way.

I “have” a lot of friends, A decent amount people that I made connections with over the years going out or just people I went to school with. I had a good few of them. And sure I would make plans to catch up with them, Or to talk about random things that interested the both of us. But reality hit hard when I realised it was only one sided. When it was only I that made effort.
And when I noticed, Everything I saw became clearer, and everything that didn’t bother me started to. My snapchats would be included of all the people I use to hang out with, all hanging out with each other, My Facebook would be all of my friends tagging each other in videos and photos, or friends posting their own photos of getting coffee with someone, Friends that I use to be apart of group chats with and all hang together with. I would wake every morning and see the things that these people are doing that probably could have had me included, either it be just going to a night club, Or going out for a drive and just casually getting coffee together, Even just hanging at someone’s house for god knows why. 
Just these small moments that seemed like nothing started meaning everything to me, Because I wasn’t there to enjoy those moments myself with the people that I cared about, that I thought cared about me. So every time I would see these small tiny parts of their lives and realising that I could have been apart of it but wasn’t, Made me feel just completely and Utterly Alone. 

So I got tired of it, I got sick of seeing all these people I thought cared for me not make effort to keep apart of their lives. I got sick of seeing couples being in love and showing off each other’s achievements in life., I got sick of people talk about “Being alone” but wouldn’t bother to reply when I ask if they cared to catch up and talk.
I got tired and sick of it all, Of being being constantly reminded that I only mattered when I made the effort to be. 
I felt alone every time I opened my phone and saw no notifications.
But after almost two months of getting use to it... I’m still not.

Sorry for the long read, But I have no where else to say how I feel. Or felt I guess.

Here’s to a Happy two months 😓.

62,"I didn’t have a bad childhood by any stretch, but I would describe my life at home as “erratic”. My dad ran away from home when he was 14, and it was right around the time I turned 14 that we began to argue and fight a lot. The way he described it to me years later, he was missing that part of his rule book—he wasn’t exactly sure how a typical 14, 15, 16 year old was supposed to be raised, and I think that brought about a lot of insecurity in him, which manifested itself into embarrassment and, in turn, anger. As a result, the mood of the house could just as easily have been determined by a dice roll every day. I was never 100% sure if everyone was okay. There were some great days,  but most of them were just so hectic and erratic, because my dad’s mood dictated the mood of the house. 

Because of this (I think), I developed this need to make sure everyone is okay. Back then, and still to this day, I do it with laughter. I make jokes, I try to make everyone laugh/smile. I feel like a fucked up 1950s entertainer sometimes—there’s this OCD-ish part of my brain that needs to make sure everyone is okay. It’s been that way for as long as I can remember.

I moved out in 2012, and I now live in another state with my wife and her parents (one of whom was diagnosed with advanced stage prostate cancer) . Since then, my dad’s health has gotten progressively worse—he’s not dying, but he’s lost some toes on one foot, as well as had surgery on his shoulder that’s left him in excruciating pain. He’s always been very vocal about his mental/physical pain, so he spends a lot of time at home yelling and crying and generally acting it out. My mom (who works full-time) has become increasingly stressed out because of all of this, not to mention taking him to appointments, cleaning him, taking care of the house, etc. and the talk from her lately has been that she doesn’t feel romantic towards my dad anymore, and that she wants to be out of the marriage. 

Some of the words that come to mind when I think about how this makes me feel: anxious. Scared. Hurt. Failure.

It’s activating the part of my brain that needs to make sure everyone is okay, and I know that I realistically can’t do that. I’ve never been diagnosed with OCD, but it’s what I imagine OCD feels like—I need to fix this because my life will be a scrambled mess of pieces if I don’t.

This feeling has leaked into other parts of my life as well, especially at work (I work the front desk at a hotel). I’ve been so distracted with thoughts of divorce, illness, death, family, that I’ve been messing up little things at work—things I *know* I know how to do. Naturally, this occasionally brings about disagreements between me and my co-workers (one of whom I had been close with for about a year until she got a second job and became much less available). The possibility of disagreement, though—and the possibility that someone might not be okay with me—feels like it’s driving me insane. I’m trying harder to make my co-workers laugh, I’m constantly worried about their opinion of me, and I have panic/anxiety attacks almost every day at the thought of everyone hating me and wanting me to go away. When I’m not at work, I lay on my back and over-think, and cry, and rage, and rationalize, and create false scenarios in my mind, and react, in what feels like an endless loop.

The other day, the aforementioned co-worker I’m closest with texted me and told me that everyone loves me, but I’m being very frustrating right now. I tried to explain what I was going through, but to some degree it feels as though it fell on deaf ears. Because of who I am and the state of my mental being, I’m there for everyone—I love to listen and fix and give advice. It makes me mad that it feels as though no one in my life (apart from my wife) has my back the way I have theirs. I’m upset that there was no benefit of the doubt extended to me—nobody stopped and said “wait, he’s not usually like this, I wonder if he’s okay.” I feel like, instead, everyone huddled behind me and murmured to each other about me. 

But I don’t know if that’s what the anxiety from the situation back home is making me feel. I need to make sense of this part of my life. I need to feel better. ",22Mar2019,1

Let me add in some context, I've spent the last week in hospital with migraine attacks so hellish-ly bad that I can't do anything except curl in a ball and be in pain for hours, or even days. (I mean, they put me in the hospital, ffs).  
But now I am at home, and while still in pain, I do have some coping strategies I've been sent home with.

68,"This happened a while ago, so I'm sorry if the details are mixed up.

When I was in grade school, I was a nerd. My friend group was content with playing trading card games or video games and talking about TV shows. However, unlike the rest of the group, I was addicted to the idea of love. I had so many crushes, but never really dated, since my nerd upbringing cut me off from social norms. The girl I asked to the middle school dance accepted, but (after a very awkward night) never talked to me again. Of course, after some tears and heartbreak, I was back to crushing on any girl who seemed moderately cool.

So, when I got to high school, I immediately fell for a cute girl with dark hair who read her emo poetry in front of our English class. She seemed so much deeper and more interesting than anyone I had met before then. And more than that, she actually talked to me! We had a similar taste in music that lead to one conversation, then another. We passed noted, wrote dumb poems, and made snarky comments about the ""normal"" kids in class.

She also exuded sexual energy. I was a nerd who still played Pokemon and was in the marching band, so her overt flirting and constant physical contact was overwhelming. She was voracious. Even though she had a boyfriend at the time, that didn't stop her from giving me my first kiss behind the bleachers during halftime at a football game (I know how cliched that sounds, but it's true). To an awkward virgin, it was like living in a dream.

As I got to know her better, though, the cracks started to appear. Her boyfriend was a druggie and her dealer. She had issues with abuse at home. She cut herself. She went to parties where people got high and had sex. She missed class to spend time in the nurses office, or didn't come to school at all some days. The day her boyfriend dumped her, she spent nearly a week in and out of school, spending most of her time with her other friends crying.

I was starting to realize my position in this. I was an outsider. I was ""the sweet guy who didn't know what was really happening"". I was a toy for her to play with and feel better about herself. That didn't stop me from asking her out at the end of the semester (I was still an idiot after all), but she told me I didn't deserve to get dragged into her life. Looking back, I think I wanted to help her get away from the terrible things she was going through. But she was right. I couldn't.

We drifted apart after that for a couple semesters. I took the rejection pretty hard, but slowly recovered. I still talked to her occasionally, but she had to repeat that English class so we didn't have any classes together.

One day during my sophomore year, an announcement came on over the loudspeaker. The girl had gone missing, and they asked anyone with information to come to the office. I asked around about it, but later that day thy made another announcement that she had been found. Nobody seemed to know any details, and after that announcement I never saw her in school again.

The rest of my High School years passed uneventfully. I kept my grades up, dating a few girls and becoming even more nerdy. I was one of those kids whose parents just assumed I was going to college, so I put in my applications and off I went.

I had been in college for about a month when I got a friend request on Facebook. It was her.

We started talking, and after my initial surprise, she told me her whole story. She had gotten another boyfriend, a guy out of high school who could get her more drugs. That day in her sophomore year, she had run away from her abusing dad with the guy, though they were quickly caught. She got a few months in juvie for underage possession. The guy had gotten a decade for drug possession and statutory rape.

After she served her time, she started going to therapy. She said the therapist had asked her to find a new role model, and she had thought of me. She had saved the notes we passed to each other, and my naive positivity probably resonated with the therapist. In retrospect, it's not that surprising that I was one of the few positive people in her life, even if I was just a nerd trying to impress her.

She told me she had written new responses to the notes I had sent her, whole journals of them. She imagined a new path, one where she had told me everything and I could have helped her. She knew it actually didn't happen, but the idea of it gave her the courage to push herself to be better. She told me I had saved her life, even if I didn't know it.

I still think about her. Yes, I was just a horny, nerdy kid, but I was nice to her. I had no idea how much that really meant to her until years later. She taught me that kindness alone can change someone's life, or even save them from a downward spiral.

Not even when they aren’t home like when I ran away the first time, but in front of them and tell them I love them despite their abuse, but I have to take care of myself. I thought they’d realize what they’ve been doing when I ran away, but they don’t think they’re being abusive, they think it’s love. I don’t think they’re ever going to change. But for now, I have to take care of myself in this environment until I can sustain myself. 

I am in therapy, which has helped me, but it’s through my college. They only allow 15 sessions for the year and my last session is Tuesday. Then I’m all alone. I don’t have any skills to combat these feelings of suicide and hopelessness. Anyone who has experience in this type of environment understands what I mean. I’m tired of living.",22Mar2019,3

75,"I know 25 is still pretty young, but I can't help it. I started school later than most, I graduate college later than most, and now at 25 I've never had a job (nothing. 0 work experience) and it's no longer ok to be an intern with the rest of the 18-19 year olds. I have never been in a serious relationship. My only boyfriend was a 19 yo when I was 14, who was a drug addicted cheater and was basically only using me. We were together for 1 week before my parents found out and that was that. I've basically spent all my life in academia, because I gained weight and left sports and academia was the only other thing I was good at. I've let myself go since the age of 16, which is the last time I was truly happy with myself. I played sports, had a lot of friends, spent a lot of time with them laughing, had no real worries, was skinny AF, and had my whole life ahead of me. I peaked at 16, and it's all been downhill from then on. 

I've spent 20-21-22-23-24 and now 25 obese (not much, but I'm definitely overweight and my BMI is 30/31 which is technically obese). I never wear make up, I don't even comb my hair. My hair is frizzy and tangled and awful, and I have no motivation to make it look better. I will never look better as long as I'm fat. So I spent my time hating skinny girls and eating more, because what's the point? At 25, I now think if I start right now and lose weight - I'll be 26 before I see any real results (will turn 26 in fall). 26 is too old to start life!!! I should have had those experiences at 20(first boyfriend, first party, first time drinking, first job, first car, first time driving alone, first time going out with someone, dating, first time dancing with someone, first time saying ""i love you"", first time having sex, first kiss, first solo traveling adventure, first apartment, etc etc). 

what would you think of a 26 year old woman being an ""intern"" ? Or getting her first job ? first kiss ? Being a virgin ? living with her parents in the same room she lived in when she was 5 ? I know people have different timelines, but I've missed so much time it's ridiculous. I'm too old for most guys now. I'll probably end up alone. I look a lot younger than my age (perks of being fat and short and having acne scars, I guess...) and this guy who I thought liked me asked me what year I was born in and I said 93 and he almost gasped! Turns out, he was born in 97 and I'm a grandma. He's been treating me very differently since then. lol calm down I'm not that old... but I guess I might be, cause he's only 22. I also referred to myself as ""young"" in a job interview and was blatantly told ""you're not that young"". lol 

I just feel like the 30s are the time to settle down, and do other things. It's too late for experiences. Even late 20's is too late for ""experimenting"". That's college, and I hid away my college years cause I was fat. and now I'm thinking, if I keep staying fat, I'll lose the other years that I have left. But honestly, I don't care anymore because ... I should have done those things in my early 20s. Now it's too late for all of that, and so I should just accept that I've missed out. and move on. I'll probably never have sex, and will kill myself by 30 if I'm still living the same life. ",22Mar2019,2
76,"I tried to talk to a girl, got called a creep and a rapist, I don't think I look like one (I hope). I tried to have friends, they all betrayed me. Sometimes I don't want to speak to anyone, but other times I do. There's this group of people that I try to talk to, and so far that's going alright I think. They're cool I hope. I can only talk to them through text messaging, just so I won't have to see any faces. Faces are fucking weird. They stare at me and they make me feel unnerved. Whenever I talk to them in real life, I apologize afterwards. I don't even know why. I just act stupid. I could have the greatest day ever, but as soon as I have to talk to anyone, I'd go into a deep depression. I constantly second-guess everything, and I try to make my personality different for every person I meet. Sometimes I go hyper and can't stop moving and do some extreme risky shit. I don't know what's going on and honestly, it really sucks. I am not a functioning human being. I just want to be like you. I don't want to look like a creep or rapist.

79,"I never thought I would be 25 and very  single, I am pretty smart girl I should be with someone by now. I have however spent the past 8yrs of my life ducking and diving away from anyone who had an interest in me, focused on school and now here I am very single with no end in sight with all my goals archived. In the past 2 years I have become incredibly successful in my field, I am on the a-track to getting my Masters in a few years and I make more money than I know what to do with usually left with thousands at the end of the month. I have a blessed life but I have come to realize you can buy as many shoes, invest in so many charities but you get home and you're lonely and sad. 

&amp;#x200B;

Being focused on school was more like an excuse to myself and guys who were interested in me because I  feel like I am scared of getting into a relationship. Pretty much commitment issues, the longest relationship I have been in was 3 whole weeks. I fear being that close and vulnerable to anyone. I fear that they won't understand my chosen celibacy. I fear that I will never meet up their expectations. I fear that they won't understand my relationship with God and I know that my family will never accept him as he is because I am the ""sweetheart"" of the family and no one is good enough for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

On top of that it's  difficult for me trust men, due to things that have happened in my past and watching my dad abuse my mom for all of my childhood. Growing around 6 overprotective boys who used girls willy-nilly and discarded them without thinking twice also didn't help.

&amp;#x200B;

And I get that 25 is a little bit young to be complaining about being single but I have been watching my friends pair up and get married and have kids these past few years and I just here like what am I doing with my life. Last year I attended 3 weddings and 2 friends got babies, this year I have six, yes \*SIX\* friends who are pregnant. I feel like it comes with growing up in a Christian society where people marry young, I am pretty sure there is a rule or something about being 25, single and Christian makes you a modern day leper. Jokes aside being single has made me an outcast in my social group as I don't share the same experiences as they do.

&amp;#x200B;

And it's not like if I didn't want a boyfriend I couldn't get one. I could literally leave the house now and have one by this afternoon.  I am not hideously ugly or startling beautiful, but guys look at me all the time, mostly with that funny mistful look in their eyes. My reaction is usually WTF are you looking at? I am a mess! Last year one of the most  gorgeous guys tried chatting me up and my reaction was literally; ""dude have you looked yourself in the mirror, you're hot, why would you be interested in me?  You can do so much better."" He genuinely looked crushed by my rejection. I am a idoit I know, but you don't understand a guy that gorgeous interested in me didn't make sense, from the moment we arrived my friends couldn't stop talking about him and staring at him. I didn't care much about him because here was this gorgeous tanned guy with dark hair and a Duchenne smile, I have seen a million of those and then he came straight for me?! 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes have self image issues despite hours spent in the gym, sometimes I was just losing weight but I always had a little fat here and there and I could never get the thighs and legs I always dreamed of. I gave up but kept the weight off then quiet recently I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism (which I should add is a chronic disease and I will be on medication till the day I die, I know I am a hot mess)  and my weight issues made sense. I have learned to love myself for how I look and appreciate the the smallest things, and still an avid member of the gym. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am very much a traditionalist and believe a woman and a man have certain roles in a relationship and maybe that's put unreasonable expectations on guys I have had an interest in. I realize that this is 2019 and things have changed but men are meant to be a protector and provider to their woman and I expect that from my partner. The last relationship I was in was when I was high school and when I called my boyfriend at that time to tell him I had been assaulted I expected him to come with a butchers knife ready to kill someone but he barely comforted me. He failed me in a sense. I got over that relationship very quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

God did not make man to be alone, Adam had Eve, yes I am surrounded by great friends and people but it's not enough. Some people do choose a life celibacy like the Apostle Paul but it's not for me I don't want to be a crazy cat lady with 15 cats. I burn with passion. I am under no illusion that a boyfriend or a husband will fill the Jesus size hole in my soul only He can but I am lonely.

80,"I'm 38, male. I've been unemployed for a year due to downsizing. I cannot for the life of me find work. Not in my field, not in another field, not entry level, not mid-career, and Whole Foods recently rejected my application. I used to be very competitive. I work(ed) in higher education admin, scholarship admin, and international program. I am at a loss, utterly and totally at a loss. I feel like things are over for me. 

I've always had depression and anxiety. I'm on the highest dosage of lamictal/lamotrigine you can be on. Also on lithium. Occasionally on perphenazine. Lately I have lost interest in virtually everything, save for during my manic episodes in which I will make expensive purchases to unhappily and obsessively pursue interests that I used to have in my 20s but gave up on (it never works anyway), obsession with travel (and I mean obsession; obsession so strong it affects my energy level and ability to do much of anything else). None of these pursuits give me the remotest semblance of satisfaction or happiness. 

For the first time in my life I have no goals, no plan, no real interests. In my 20s I had big plans about what I wanted to do with my life (it involved teaching as a professor), I traveled, I attended a well known university graduate program, but I failed at pursuing those goals. I washed out. I failed and am living with my failure. I'm now drowning in debt from that misadventure. I found that I was simply not intellectually capable, and my inability to concentrate rendered the pursuit pointless anyway. I failed at my life plans and I haven't found anything to replace them. I'm getting older, looking older, feeling older, acting older. 

I've never been able to focus. I move from unfinished book to unfinished book, interest to interest, thought to thought. It's so fast it's a blur. I finish nothing. I can't even enjoy video games, TV shows, movies. Even books are a challenge. 

I do little more than sit around being nostalgic or trying to grasp some big amazing concept that's always out of reach. I'm never satisfied. I feel dread all the time. 

I have no more sex drive. I love my wife and am very attracted to her, but the sex is dead and it's my fault. Even viagra barely works (I get a pathetic semi a sinus blockage.) 

I've been to therapist after therapist after therapist. It seems that best I can have, as a result of the meds, is a sense of blah. Ongoing, never ending blah. Ennui. Without them I'm out of control depressed and manic. Unable to function. Unemployable and off-putting. Angry. Sad. Short tempered. Obsessed. Clumsy. Unfocused. Dangerous behind the wheel. Reckless. 

I just want to enjoy something. Anything. Fucking video game would be enough at this point. But EVERYTHING is a slog. EVERYTHING. Nothing is interesting and everything is a chore. 

It didn't used to be this bad. I used to be enthusiastic about things, even if I was fighting depression and mania. 

I run a lot. That's good I guess. I love the feeling of running for miles and miles and then feeling exhausted and sweaty and spent afterwards. It's a good kind of tired, like I earned it. It makes me too exhausted to care about not caring. It calms my mind. For about an hour afterwards. (But I also suck at running which is why I'll never do it with other people.)

I know that no one here on Reddit can fix this for me. But I'm open to any thoughts that anyone may have. Or maybe if you just want to commiserate... ",22Mar2019,5

83,"  Cause last night, when a high school friend that used to have a crush on me, as well as 2 of my other old high school friend that i haven't seen in years, showed up at my door like they used to and they came in to smoke a bowl.   
   Since this guy makes my boyfriend uncomfortable cause he liked me, I cut contact with Jim when me and bf started dating. Like kinda just let it drift, because I would expect the same of my boyfriend. 
  So I text boyfriend, boy and his friends just showed up and after they smoke a bit well kick them out. Then, to solidify that I want alone in a room with this boy, I sent a snapchat of boys friend cuddling my dog with us all(,those 3 and me and my sister and cousin) laughing in the background, just to make him more comfortable. 
   So I guess he opened that after a while, ignored it and ignored my text, and the 2 others that came after that. 
    So still ignoring me, except a stiffly worded ""good morning"" text way after I sent mine. I know that's why hes pissed off, because even though I was a virgin when I met him and am insanely loyal, and disgusted by cheaters, I've been accused of cheating twice, like her seriously thought I had fucked these other guys. 
   One was his roommate, who spent like 8 hours cooking something and my boyfriend got tired and fell asleep, I woke him up when it was ready and he STORMED to the bedroom and went back to sleep. So I ate alone with his roommate,  went and BEGGED him for a ride for like 20 mins cause my parents wanted me home, and finally accepted a ride from the roommate. 
  When I saw him the next day it was full cold shoulder and silent treatment, till it came out that he was under the impression that we have fucked while he was passed out in the next room. After me having to cry and beg him to believe me, and if he couldn't he could just break up with me, he agreed and we were good, things were good again. 
   Second time, a coworker saw me buying ingrediants for a cheesecake(we work at a grocery store it ain't uncomming) and he asks me to make him one this week, and one the coming week for Valentines day for his girlfriend(keep in mind all me and his coworker talk about is how great our SO is and hes like 3 years younger than me, he reminded me of my lil cousin who I was having a terrible time with recently and I saw him like a little brother)
  So just to avoid any upset, I tell my boyfriend instantly, talk about it a few times, and eventually invite my boyfriend to drop it off with me, cause were meeting st the mall and he could give me a ride. So we go, meet the guy who pays me, and hes in an INSTANT terrible mood, and I know it's that, so we get to the car he explodes and I tell him to knock it off and why would I bring him to meet a guy I'm fucking?? And things are fine we talk it out. 
   Now this shit, I cant deal with it. I just dont know what to do, especially when I've learnt QUESTIONABLE information from snooping on his phone, having him download tinder twice, for stupid lies of reasons. 
  I know how gross snooping is, but he INSISTED on us having each others fingerprints in each others phones, but when mine stopped working on his he said the scanner was broken(but unlocked it with his own fingerprint often enough) 
  So I know hes talking to girls, I dont know what they're talking about and I hate my fucking life ",22Mar2019,3

Now scientists and biologists say this is impossible, since the H20 molecule is too small to cause an IgE mediated reaction (otherwise known as an allergic reaction) and that if they were allergic to H20 they'd be dead since science also says the human body is 70% H20.

Our venue was phenomenal! It was amazing and I remember sitting there looking around thinking, “wow!!! I’m actually here and this is the happiest day of my life”! 
The first 6 months were amazing. Always smiling and laughing and spending time together. Then one night it all changed. We were looking for something in the spare bedroom  and he yelled at me. So I yelled back and he raised his hand to me. I flinched and was taken back. I ran out of the house and called my ex boyfriend and he came and picked me up. He told me I should leave and I actually got mad at him for saying that...but I had no idea how worse it was going to get. 
Over the next year and a half, it was hell. He was cheating on me and with women off Craig’s list and women from work. Even women that were at our wedding. He would lie to his friends and family about me. Then the mental abuse started. I was called every name in the book on the daily. He wished death on me on a daily basis. After he broke me, spiritually, he broke me physically. I was his punching bag every time something went wrong. One time his bank charged him double and I got the consequence for it. He beat me so bad that night, I thought I was going to die. He punched my face, kicked my stomach and punched me repeatedly in the back. I was bruised so badly I could barely move. I ended up going to the hospital because neither of us knew I was pregnant and I lost the baby due to his beating me. I was forced to lie to the hospital and say I fell and surprisingly, they bought it. I was in bed for days wishing I was dead. He would go to work and get mad if I didn’t make dinner when he got home. Or the house wasn’t clean to his standards. 
One night, my family stopped by to see how things were and he made it known that he wasn’t happy they were there.

100,"Hey guys, I'm a guy(21) from The Netherlands and I like to free-climb trees. My problem however, I don't know of anyone else who does this. I would really like to share my favorite spots and hear from others, but I feel like I'm the only one.

Are there any European free climbers or is there an existing community I don't know about? I would really love to hear from anyone who can relate and knows the tops of the trees.

I hereby also recommend everyone to try climbing a tree. The feeling you get when reaching the top is amazing. There is something amazing about being meters high, only having yourself and the tree to rely on. Sometimes you have to really overcome your fear or push yourself to new levels. If I manage to reach the top in such a circumstance I usually get my rewards in adrenaline and the feelings of meaning/accomplishment. I once spent 15 minutes on a branch, not daring to move a muscle, watching a runner that sometimes past right below me, 6 meters down. When I 'unfroze' and climbed the rest of the tree it was seriously one of the best feelings of my life.

In less extreme circumstances, when the wind is blowing softly, the sun has been shining for a few days, and the trees aren't that slippery from moss, climbing can be extremely meditative. You are in a place where no one has been before, almost no one can see you(people tend to not look up) and where you can just chill with nature. These experiences are extremely relaxing to me and usually make my week. To find your own private and beautiful space, sometimes in the middle of a city, is just amazing to me.

Well, I hope this post made sense and was posted in the right sub. I would like to spread and share my love for free climbing and hope I can finally find some kindred spirits;)",22Mar2019,4

The thing is, I don't know how to open up about it. I feel if I don't, I'm suppressing a part of myself. And I really would rather find a way to share this with a (future) partner.

New Year’s eve of last this year I for some reason known to man decided to take a tab of acid while on a great amount of speed of which I had done many times before except this time my trip was terrifying. I was with my closest friends who were also on acid but I felt like I couldn’t trust them, like they were out to get me for no reason what so ever. Ever since I have not felt the same, I’ve felt disconnected, anxious of which I had never felt before. I also started getting a strange vision which is blurry at times, I’ve read into things such as hddp and visual snow but then again I don’t know if it’s my Anxious self over thinking it. I have trouble talking to people sometimes, like zone out completely and get anxiety about nothing. By my own fault I had continued even after that bad trip on very few occasions taking drugs, MDMA, ketamine. I’m starting uni in September to study psychology  but i am so scared of everything for no reason , suicidal thoughts just pop randomly into my head, which to me is impossible as before that bad trip i used to be the happiest person. I am scared that I have ruined myself and will forever feel like this and I don’t know what to do. I have stopped all drugs for a few weeks now and plan on keeping it that way forward. If I could get some insight from other people that have experienced such things or just any feedback would be amazing. ",22Mar2019,3

106,"I wish I could create something. Something people liked, something that could support my life, something from me. I wish I could bring my friends up with me so they dont have to worry either.

107,"How is this fair to me? We talked two weeks ago about how to fix us. We agreed and you said you felt better. I have been hyper aware of all of my actions and emotions, trying to make things better. 

Now you call me, waking me up and asking me to look through documents for a number you should have memorized. I don't mind. I love you and I want to help in any way I can. Then at the end of the call, you say you want to quit your job. That you might just quit today. I ask, after a pause, if that was a joke. You say no. We hang up.

You know I depend on your income. I don't want to but for now I do. Who DOES that to a person? Not an hour into my day and I get to spend your 12 hr shift anxious and scared. 

You get home, I am making dinner. You start going over your day, not mentioning the bomb you dropped this morning. I bring it up, and I poke and prod because I need to know what's wrong. You say you're sick of the place we live. Our house doesn't feel like home and you're tired.

I tell you we have to have a plan to move states, we can't up and leave. I ask if you even want me to come with you. You insist you do. I poke more. I instigated this but I need to know. You say your mad at me for shit that doesn't matter. You say you still don't feel good in our relationship. You say that you can't remember why I make you happy. You finally say you feel like running away. 

You ask me if I see myself being a mother.

I ask why.

You refuse to answer, but I can draw my own conclusions. You started saying months ago you weren't sure if you wanted kids anymore. Coming up with all sorts of reasons. I knew it. I know you hate it when I say that to you but I fucking knew it. I shoved my instincts deep down. I started mistrusting myself when it came to you. To find out after all this time I was right. You didn't think I'd be a good mom.

We cried. Together. You say your confused. Stuck. You love me but are not happy. You say you care for me so deeply. That you lied so you didn't hurt me.

I tell you what I see in our future. You agree it sounds nice but... I ask if you think we can fix this. You hope, you say. Hope. I was so sure we could. I am sure, I think. But you aren't and that terrifies me. It kills me.

We pack it in for the night because we aren't getting anywhere and you promise you will try to help me fix this cause I can't do it alone.

We're going to bed and you make a comment about ordering 60 bags of your favorite local chips. I ask why on Earth you would need that many. You say you would miss them. I prod, like always, and you say the weekend trip you've planned for April wasn't going to be a weekend. You were going to run. You were going to abandon me. You were thinking about it, anyways.

I cried. What else can I do with information like that. You hold me and say you would never actually do that to me. I try to make the conscious effort to believe you.

The day after is awful. I am nervous and you seem fine... Except you don't.  You are still distant. You tried to spend more time with me but it didn't feel genuine. You tell me about mental health issues I never even knew you had. That you apparently didn't feel comfortable telling me for three years. That I knew but didn't know how bad it was. On top of that you're hiding behaviors. 

I don't feel like I can trust you to still come home from work. Or that trip you're still going on. Or to communicate to me what you think and feel. Or to be here if I go away for a week.

I hate this. ",22Mar2019,6
108,"I started drinking WAY too early today, I was bored and waited for my friend, got drunk like 6 hours before I was going to meet him. Now I'm tired 3 hours away, pretty much sober. Is it possible to even get drunk again and get hyped again and all that...

Just wanna sleep now.",22Mar2019,3

110,"What's so ""terrible"" about an adult not wanting to donate bone marrow to a sick relative?

I got this 10 year old nephew with some sort of crappy blood disease^1 and there's a good chance that I have ""compatible marrow"". 

Here's the thing, I don't want to go through the pain and the very real risk of serious injury or death from the harvesting procedures^2.

So I made my perfectly understandable reluctance known to the kid's parents and *now I'm the heel*?!?

I didn't make the kid sick so why am I solely responsible for MAYBE allowing him live a little longer?   

I'd be glad to donate a hundred or dollars or so to help find another match somewhere. 

Look, I feel for the kid...he got a raw deal and all but I'm not going put myself in mortal danger for him...that's for parents to do.

111,"I’m a first time in college student who got denied into the nursing program at USF and don’t know how to cope with the feeling of being denied. I’ve worked so hard to get to this point that most people can’t even get to and then  I get denied. I know i’m more than capable of being in the program, however USF doesn’t think so and it hurts. I’ve never cried so hard for so long. It’s been my dream to be a nurse and get a nursing degree from USF, and now I can’t.

115,"Imagine a voting/ballot paper with no candidate or party names. Instead, there are 50 boxes containing key policies around central themes - i.e. Healthcare, the Environment, National Security, Law/Justice, Education, Infrastructure, etc...

Prior to the election the major parties would have to publicly commit to at least 10 major policies if they get in to Government.

Every voter must number at least 10 boxes (but could number up to 50) with the policies that are of most importance to them/their ideals/values and the like.

Based on each voter’s preferences, their vote goes to the party that most closely aligns with their 10 (or more) policy preferences - which is calculated automatically based on the party’s policy commitments.",22Mar2019,6

Coming from a low income, low success background and having spent my days rising up in society since I was 16 (now 22), I am in desperate need to get a managing position. I know it's all just to prove to myself that I am more than what my parents were. But how tf could it have been any other way with the kind of unsupportive parenting that I had to endure. They literally believed that because they were fuck up college drop outs, I had to be the same. Hurtful shit to hear as a young person trying to make their way in an ever more competitive world. I don't know if I can ever forgive or forget the damage they caused.",22Mar2019,1

122,"When I was about 20/21 I got really into getting drunk, I'm a happy drunk so it didn't really cause a lot of problems, used to love it, would even start pretty early in the day sometimes, this went on for like 2-3 years

For a couple years after that, I wasn't drinking as frequently or getting as drunk, I just liked to get buzzed in the evenings. Still, every day though. At this point I would admit to myself I was an ""alcoholic"" because I didn't want to be one of those people who drank all the time and then lied to themselves. At the same time, the few once in a blue moon nights where I couldn't drink (visiting family with no booze, babysitting cousins, etc.) there wouldn't really be any problem 

Then for about a year I would just half about half a bottle of wine (which isn't a lot when you have high tolerance) after 9 PM before I would go to bed

Then after about 5 to 6 years of drinking nearly every day I just stopped without even really noticing it--no effort whatsoever--one day I realized ""wow, I haven't had any wine in like a week""

It's been about 4 months now, I've drank three times in that span, all those times were having beers with visiting family. Again, there is absolutely no effort in not drinking, it's like I've totally lost interest in it, I hardly ever think about it and certainly haven't had any desire to drink. The times I drank visiting family I didn't really have much and did it more to be social than anything

I always thought that eventually I'd have to face my alcohol abuse but I didn't think it would literally just go away with no effort on my part whatsoever, has anyone heard of other people that have had this sort of relationship with alcohol",22Mar2019,5
