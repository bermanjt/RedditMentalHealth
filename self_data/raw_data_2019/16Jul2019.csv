0,"Me and my 48 year old Mom went to our local gym together for not only the first time together but for the first time either of us work out in months/almost a year. I stopped after I had a pretty bad break up of half a year and I felt really poorly about myself, esteem, and had a hard time making friends in Highschool in the first few weeks. After a couple weeks I made some friends and I've been in a new relationship for about 1 month land a half. My friend Thomas unknowingly inspired me to go to the gym and I'm going to start improving both my health and my hygiene. My friends Mom is also paying me 50 bucks to consistently go to the gym with her! Win win for everyone!

For those wondering my regiment is: 2 10 sets of weight lifting (I left 80-70lbs), 10 minutes on the stepper, and 10 minutes on the treadmill.",16Jul2019,2
2,"I FUCKING LOVE YOU!!! So, I went to the beach with my cousin a few days ago. We locked our cars and headed down to the sand. I put my key in my Jacket's pocket (not a good idea). While we were playing fresbie, I had dropped it and did not notice. About 5 minutes before we were about to leave (we were all packed up), this lady comes up to us asking if these particular car keys belonged to us? I FREAKED THE FUCK OUT and said YES!! She said her dog found the keys while scaring away the seagulls. The spot where he found it was about 250 feet away from us and we were the only group besides another who were still at the beach. If it had not been for that dog, I have no clue how I would gotten to the pizza place and therefore back to my house. God bless that dog and give him the happiest life he deserves. I even hugged him after lol. Cute dogie.",16Jul2019,103
3,I turn some guys down because I feel unworthy and ugly. Every nice guy I met just feels imaginary and fake because I’m used to being mistreated. Before anyone says therapy I start next week. Right now I just feel like my mind is so toxic right now and I wish I had some hugs.,16Jul2019,1
4,"Does anyone really hate their body?
 I can't look at myself in any mirror or reflection. There are 2 mirrors in my room that I trust using. Anywhere else I will only look at myself through a camera lens since I feel like I look slimmer on that. I feel fat like disgustingly fat. Logically I know I'm not though. I do not know how much I weigh because I'm too scared to step on the scale, but people would always call me skinny or on the slimmer side. I definitely don't feel it though...",16Jul2019,1
6,"I'm having a small crisis now after a therapy session. I kinda discovered that all my current goals are more focused in what I want for a possible future me instead of now.

I believe I'm really influenciable in terms of beliefs and goals, and I fear that I haven't been able to find a self I can be inspired to. I think I don't reslly know what I want in life.

7,"Finally have a reason to use this throw away account. I (20M) don’t know what to do about anything in my life. Everything feels like a mess. I’ve barely felt happy over the past few months. There’s only been a few things that have actually made me happy and it feels like they’re all slipping away. No one in my family seems to want to have anything to do with me. My girlfriend (F20) is seeming incredibly distant and whenever I try to mention how I’m feeling she either seems to ignore it or not wanna hear about it. It feels like she’s ignoring me completely sometimes, I took two days off to come visit her this week and I’ve been at her house for over 24 hours and we’ve barely even talked. I tried talking to her last night about how I’ve been feeling, but she seemed tired and I didn’t wanna be a burden so I let her go to bed, after she fell asleep I sent her a text trying to explain things and trying to apologize about how I’ve been feeling off. She hasn’t even mentioned it or anything. I might be overreacting, she did just move into a new house with her best friend, so I get she’s just excited to be with her. But I still feel worthless, alone, and scared. I have two friends I feel like I can truly rely on, but I’m moving back to college text month. Everything in my life feels out of place, and it feels like the last bit of happiness is finally slipping away and no one around me cares. Nothing that used to fill me with joy or help me cope is working. Not even music, and that’s always been my go to. Everything is a mess. 

Sorry if this is worded weirdly, I’m honestly high and sad and just wanted to vent for a minute. 

TLDR: My life is a mess and I don’t know what to do,!basically.",16Jul2019,2
8,"Every now and then when I see some loose skin on the bottoms of feet, I’ll pick at it. Sometimes I’d do it for days, depending on how dry my feet are. Once i see there is no more dry skin I’ll stop and in a few days it’ll go back to normal. For the past month or so I have been constantly picking at my and for hours at a time. I’ll even do it while at work under my desk. I’ve picked so much skin that I’ll bleed, and bleed a lot or it is extremely painful to pull the skin. Now it’s to the point where it hurts to walk. It is causing me so much pain but I can’t stop. There are some times where I don’t even realize I’m doing it. How do I stop doing this? Is there a reason I’m doing it?",16Jul2019,1
11,"I'm on vacations right now but the more time I spend in home, the more I realize my school ""friends"" were a bunch of jerks.

 We went to the movies, idk if I have autism or any other social disorder, I felt so weird but I realized how much I fucking hate my friends out of the school environment and from things I can see, they are willing to leave me behind 

I realized I don't need them although right now there's no one I can talk to, I'm willing to meet new people because not too many people of my school are worth it.

The problem right now is that I don't think I have a personality well defined yet and Idk how it'll go when I get to know the people from my next new school but I really want to be more social, I want them to be interested or at least pay attention to what I say instead of being more like a black sheep.

12,"Whenever i watch a movie or a tv show i have to rewind a scene over and over again, sometimes it is mild, just repeating one scene then watching the rest of the movie and another time it gets really bad, to the point where i repeat the lines of a character and see if im listening correctly, then i open a script of the show to read if what i heard was correct and i ponder on tiny details. This only happens with shows and movies and not videos. And i can read a book perfectly fine (although slow). Whenever im at the theatre this problem doesn't exist, i don't panic to rewind and repeat things then and even though sometimes i get lost in a scene and ponder on a detail for a bit longer, it doesn't overwhelm me. Another thing is that i usually take a break from watching a movie to watch a short clip on youtube, but it doesn't bother me, and i know a lot of people do that too.

&amp;#x200B;

At first, I was proud of this because as a result I knew a lot more details and I could theorize a lot more, so I would understand a lot more of the show than my friends. But now it is really annoying, a particular episode which is 40 minutes long takes me 2 hours to finish. I feel like I'm wasting a lot of time doing this.

Anyone got some advice to fix this issue, apart from the obvious ""go watch a movie in the theatre"", thanks.",16Jul2019,1
14,"The last 8 years of my life, I felt so confused, alienated, and just vaguely mentally ill. I moved from America to South Korea 8 years ago and attended high school as a normal Korean teen. I followed the cultural norm and standards and I did everything my parents told me to do. I didn’t have a sense of “self”, I lived inside my own head. Since I couldn’t communicate in Korean properly, I made friends just by smiling and being quiet, and never really expressing myself. And I made mostly friends on the internet who I could speak English with, other people who were also mentally unhealthy and mentally ill.  
  
I wanted so badly to get out from that mental space. Before I moved to Korea, I was just an ordinary girl. After I moved, I became very reclusive and silent. In addition, my main source of social interaction were mentally ill folks. I was surrounded by weird mentality like “kill all men/white people”. “If you do x, you are evil.” Etc.  
  
It would have been easier if I had some broader context or I lived in America, so I could mentally put that sort of dialogue in context. but that was what I surrounded myself with. As a result I became very confused about the world. On one hand, I didn’t participate in Korean social culture because I didn’t understand it. On the other hand, the only American culture I participated in was online, toxic, and bizarre.  
  
My perception of the world became distorted and not straightforward. I was constantly confused by how other people acted, how I acted, what I wanted, and what I could do. I would impose rules on myself socially because I didn’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings. I constantly felt like a burden and not good enough for anyone, regardless of how much company I kept. I felt like I was bound by my own self, unable to do anything or say anything in fear of doing something “wrong”.  
  
Well, about a year and half ago I met my boyfriend online. He offered to help me settle back into the states so I’ve moved in with him. He and his family are very generous and kind and through living / interacting with him I have learned a lot about myself and how I can interact with the world. It’s really weird knowing that I can choose not to give two shits about what people think if I really want to. In a broader context, American culture is all about *freedom* and freedom of thought. Now that I understand that, I feel more assured about myself, and less and less confused as time goes by.  
  
Only recently I’ve realized just how autonomous I am. I can do pretty much anything I like. This is a weird realization for me, because for the most recent “arc” of my life it’s felt like it hasn’t been true.  
  
I’m now feeling more mentally healthy, empowered, and clear about myself. I just have one more question.  ...where do I go from here?  
  
I spent so long just trying to get through the confusion and trying to understand my surroundings that now that I have time to do things for myself, without the excessive overthinking and confusion, I feel almost empty and goal-less. I feel sad, and depressed for all the time I’ve lost. And now that I am facing full responsibility for all of my choices (something that comes with freedom/ not being a victim)... I don’t know how to proceed.  
  
There seems to be no right or wrong way to live ... just try to be happy. But then: how do I know that I’m truly happy? And how do I make myself happier? My thoughts lead me into an existential crisis.  
  
I can do whatever I want, I can try to live whatever life I want, and... realizing that was step one, but where do I go from here?",16Jul2019,1
15,"So this last senior year I ended up developing a huge crush on this girl. I always thought she was attractive since like freshman year of highschool, but I never really had any reason to be near or approach her. We ended up sharing one class senior year. 2nd day of school the teacher allowed us to pick our seats, and I ended up coming like a min late and practically all the tables(3-4 students) were filled out. There were only a couple spots available and none by any of my friends. Teacher told me I had to sit down, and my crush told me to come sit at her table with 2 of her friends. I decided to cuz why not. I'm smart, so I assumed that was possibly the reason. I'm a reasonably social person, but I'm usually shy the first week of school until I get back into the groove. We had a worksheet that required knowledge from a previous class that a lot of people in the class too, except I didn't. The teacher asked us to work on it, and since I was kinda shy at this table and didn't know how to do it, I just sat there confused trying to figure it out. My crush saw me and asked if I needed any help on it, explained it to me, and checked in on me again after I did it and asked if I understood it or not. Fast forward to later that month, one girl at the table suggested to make a groupchat for our table for that class and asked me if I wanted to be in it. I gave her my phone number. A couple days after that, my crush asked if I knew whose number was which in the groupchat and asked me for mine. Later that day, she added me on snapchat. She also requested to follow me on Instagram a couple months later after I just had made one. I snapped her that next day a random pic just to see if she would respond and she did. We kept snapping back and forth for a day until she randomly left me on open. I decided not to double snap. Two days went by without a snap and then she finally snapped me. It went back and forth again and then she left me on open late evening but this time she snapped me next morning. Pattern continued from October to December. Obviously, we got a streak and frequently snapped unless she left me on open. I usually responded to all her snaps until one week I decided just to respond once a day for the streak and then ignore her. Twice that week she blue messaged me random questions about that class that were pretty useless tbh. In class, she always used to ask me for help whenever she had a question(cuz I'm smart). We talked a decent amount then(mostly about the class). However, our teacher reorganized the seating assignments in like late October and I didn't get to sit next to her anymore. Since then, I didn't talk in person with her at all, but I kept snapping her. I drew up conversation with her a couple times by responding to her story and talking about if she was ready for a test, and she seemed really nice and had decent responses. Sometimes, I tried sparking a convo by saying a statement instead of a question, but in those instances, she usually just replied with a selfie(like all her snaps). Anyways, December to February she started to never leave me on open and started responding super quickly(sometimes in like a couple second or even minutes even if I took hours to respond). If I had to guess, I'd say she's shy except with her friends and girls. Doesn't really talk to many guys. In class when I didn't sit by her, I got a lot of attention from the teacher since I was smart and aced tests but didn't do homework. A lot of the times I got called out, everyone looked at me and a lot of times she looked at me and smiled. One time I could even hear my name in the convo I think she was saying I was super smart and then looked across the room and smiled at me(doesn't mean anything I know). Anyways, in February she went to a school dance with a dude from another school and through researching, I found out she was dating and had been doing so since early December, which surprised me because her snap frequency and response time really started becoming really good then. I became salty after finding out she was dating, and I cut the 100+ day streak we had because either way we didn't really talk in person anymore and she didn't start convos over snap. She still kept snapping me for a week after I cut the streak until I blue chatted her that I didn't want one. Two months later, I find out she broke up and a couple weeks after that I sent her a snap, and she left me on open. I didn't want to snap her again, so I just left it at that and she never responded back. 



I just want to know if there were any clear signs I should've pursued and asked her out here, or was it all ambiguous and meaningless tbh? I know I should've asked her out either way in the beginning cuz it seemed like she was really interested, but I had limitations. I was kinda addicted to seeing her hot selfies all the time on snapchat and wish I didn't cut our streak since she ended up breaking up because now I basically have no contact with her now. We are going to the same college this fall, but I feel like she hates me now but I still have a major crush on her that I am unable to get over. You think there's any way I could reach out to her when it starts?

TLDR- girl asked me to sit by her, always asked me questions in class whenever she was confused, added me on snap and Instagram, asked for my phone number, and responded to my snaps all the time and quickly. Also tested me(I think) by leaving me on open for two days after we snapped the whole day after she added me first. Smiled at me a lot of times in class and sometimes talked about how smart I was to other people. I cut our streak off(100+) after I found out she was dating and told her to stop snapping me. Snapped her a couple months later after I knew she broke up with bf and she didn't respond. Does she hate me now and did I have a chance or clear signs she liked me for getting her? Any chance or idea of how to reconnect with her in college this fall(we are going to same one)?",16Jul2019,1
16,"i'm a 26yr old guy, broke up with my ex just about a year ago. we were so in love with each other for 18 months. we talked about getting married and having kids, and where we would raise them. things went wrong, the relationship slowly died, and it tore us apart inside. she was the biggest love i have ever had so far. 

she's austrian, born and raised, and now i find myself listening to german speaking music a lot, and i'd like to learn it too (probably not going to lol). she had a very strong accent and i used to hear her speak german regularly.

i've moved on for the most part but that girl will always have a place in my heart. the relationship was supposed to happen, and supposed to end. 

could listening to german music mean anything? like a longing for her or could it be sort of like looking at old photos? like a nostalgic thing",16Jul2019,1

18,"I’m sorry if nothing from this point on makes any sense. I’m just really having a hard time right now. 

My grandpa passed away 2 weeks ago. We were very close, but for some reason, I didn’t realize how close we were until he was gone and I hate myself for it. 

Since he passed, I have completely lost track of time. I barely know what day it is anymore. 

I think that the fact that he was cremated is messing with me. When a family member has died in the past, I think I got some sort of closure from seeing their body at the visitation. It’s like seeing their body made me come to terms with the fact that they were actually gone. But going to my Grandpa’s memorial service and seeing the tiny little box containing what was once him has me all sorts of messed up. 

I’m experiencing grief for the first time in my life and it honestly scares me because I already knew about the stages of grief, but I didn’t know you could experience more than one stage at a time. Denial hit me hard yesterday, all because I got a sympathy card from a friend in the mail. 

I don’t know why horrible things have to happen to an honestly good person like my grandpa. He shouldn’t have gotten sick. He shouldn’t have passed so soon. He should have had a much longer life. I wanted my kids to meet him and know the great guy that he was.

I don’t know who has control over things like this, but right now, I hate that person. 

I try to make myself feel better by thinking about the last few times he managed to smile and mouth the words “love you,” but that quickly becomes overshadowed by the memories of him saying “I’m dying” and “Help me. Help me out.”

I love you, Grandpa, and I will miss you every day until I get to see you again. In your honor, I will always do my best to TCB⚡️",16Jul2019,2

20,"So essentially, for the longest time, I've always believed I'm stupid, dumb, and had nothing to offer to society, but then a certain phrase was said to me: ""People who think there dumb are actually smart."" So then I begin to feel intelligent, but then I realize that me feeling intellectually capable actually mean's I'm unintelligent.

I kept sexting with my ex for some time after what happened. We were super close and remained good friends after we split up, so I let myself go and said a little too much emotional stuff while texting. Last night, my ex forced me to have sex with her, otherwise, she'd tell my gf what happened. My girlfriend is the sweetest person on earth and she has some self-esteem issues. It'd break her soul if she knew I was capavle of doing such thing. She's close to my only two friends left in town.

I bursted out in tears while having sex with my ex. She was sorry and understanding, but we kept going. She felt guilty, for what I could tell, but I know she's still capable of doing lots of damage
Today, I was so depressed food tasted like nothing. I'm currently shit-faced drunk and regretful. I felt used and powerless. I maybe would've chosen to have sex one more time with her, since she's leaving and she's still one of te he most important people in my life, but last night I felt forced and hopeless. I disrespected and broke the trust of such a kind person and she'd find out I'm trash...
I've been thinking about telling my girlfriend, but not only would that absolutely break her and leave her feeling hopeless, but it'd leave me lonely with my own thoughts and completely depressed. She's the one that got me to lose 45 lbs. and motivated me to find a counselor, in the only 4 months we've been dating.

22,"I always wanted to get into an interracial relationship and honestly had a preference for white guys than guys of my own race. For many years I dated guys my race the only time I slightly dabbled with someone who wasn't my race is when I dated this mixed race guy who people assumed was a light skinned black guy. It wasn't until now where I met this white guy online who I am now seeing.


I have been out in public with him on several occasions and I don't think I can continue seeing him. Like I understood beforehand that people stared but not *this* much. The starring would be okay if it wasn't directed at me most of the time. 


There are four types of looks I have seen in people's eyes when we've been together: shock, surprise, confusion, disappointment and disgust. The later I have seen on people who are my race especially men and I feel shame. Shame that I am with him, shame that I had sex with him early on in our relationship, shame that I like someone like him. It's embarrassing, they look at me like they know what we do when we are alone.


We were recently at a restaurant full of black waiters and I am someone who likes to look people in the eye when they talk to me we were basically served by every single waiter in the restaurant and each one of them just looked at me with utter disappointment in their eyes. The only female waiter wouldn't even look at me or addressed me only talking to my partner.
What's up with that?


I assumed maybe I was reading these faces wrong as I am severely depressed until last night where I had an uber driver pick me up after our date and my partner and I said goodbye by a quick hug because I don't like PDA. When I got into the car the driver asked me endless questions about my relationship with my partner and that got me thinking. My cousin was the only person who knew I was dating a white guy when I told her she was okay with it. I told my brother tonight and he got angry and told me ""to dump the guy.""

25,"My whole life I’ve walked on eggshells with everyone I’ve ever met. I’ve always been an awkward bumbling weirdo who hates talking to other people. 

I recently got my first job about a year ago and even though it sucked for the first time in years I was actually pretty happy. I had money, a social life, was doing well in school, etc. I wish I’d known it would all come crashing down again. I’m just not someone meant to be happy I guess. 

The sadness of my depression has started making room for rage. I always have to be the understanding, patient one. The quiet, unassuming one. I’m the person everyone gets mad at, who has to apologize profusely for just taking up space. I’m not allowed to be mad at anyone. 

It was like that with my former best friend who, after an argument, told me I was a burden who was hard to love, that she only talked to me so I wouldn’t kill myself, that I’m unhealthy to be around and I need therapy to improve myself. She used deliberately triggering language to hurt me because she used to be a big part of my support system when I was suicidal as a kid. Despite all this, I was still the one groveling to HER for having the audacity to get upset, because as usual, I’m not allowed to be angry. Ever. I have to be punished. Then she ghosted me and has made it clear she has no interest in reconciling. 

It’s even worse with my parents. My dad who does nothing but drink and then complain about his health, as if it’s my fault he’s unhealthy and refuses to change his habits. My mother who is obviously having an affair but gaslights anyone who calls her out for her bullshit, because she has all the money and wants to send it to her fucking boyfriend in another country, that she hates this family that we’re all burdens on her. Once again I’m a burden. 

My siblings and so called friends barely know I exist. Nobody gives a fuck. College is the happiest time of everyone else’s lives. But no, my time passed when I was a little kid. I’m never going to be allowed to be happy, to be around people who actually give a fuck about me, and respect me. 

Therapy didn’t work. Medication didn’t work. I used to have so much potential as a kid. Now I have shitty grades and no real job prospects. No real friends who genuinely value me the way I value them. No romantic aspirations although admittedly, I’ve known since I was small that I would never have that.  An awful and toxic family I despise. 

I can’t let go of my anger. It’s become so comfortable to me. My daily thought process is just a constant spiral of how fucking sick I am with my life. How badly I want to get revenge on people who are so justified in hurting me and carrying on with their day. 

I’ve wanted to kill myself for so long. Ive hated myself so much, ever since I was ten years old, I’ve always wanted to punish myself for never being good enough. Now I want so desperately to punish everyone else for making me feel this way. 
I just wish I could see everyone’s guilt and shame after I’m dead. I’d like them to recognize how unfair they were to me, feel maybe a tiny bit of remorse. But realistically?

31,"And she was hot as fuck! Beautiful, curvy, her hair was tied back nicely. She wore thin clothing that gripped her body and highlighted her curvy features. Great ass, great boobs. She was nothing short of a movie actress. You don't see that kinda beauty these days.

So I'm jogging looking at her, I was absolutely mesmerised. My headphones were on, cleanin' out my closet was playing. And she was on the park bench probably resting after taking a jog herself. And as she checked her phone, she does the darndest thing. She shoved a finger into her nose, and started digging. I mean it wasn't even a short peck. Her finger was in there shoving away harder than Eminem shoves the shovel in the song that was playing. 

So after a few seconds of vigorous digging and shoving, she finally gets it out. And then.. She held it in her hand, and fucking looked at it. She was admiring it like it's a marvel.

37,"So, long story short, my boss took me off the schedule for a period of time during the summer, along with a few other people. My partner said he would be able to help me out, but some things came up in his life as well. (Not his fault) I asked my landlord for an extension on my rent &amp; the date is this Saturday. I still don't have the rent &amp; they weren't able to keep the late fees from being stacked on top of everything.

Along with all of that, my lease is up at the end of the month &amp; I haven't renewed it because they raised the rent on the next one &amp; I was struggling enough with the current price as it was.
All of this has just left me feeling hopeless &amp; lost.
On top of all of this, I'm transgender (ftm) &amp; have needed to dip into my surgery fund to help deal with paying what I could. With that, I feel like I'm going to have to wait even longer than I already anticipated for the desired surgery.

I reached out to my doctor when I went to ask about labs. They've implemented a new screening thing, asking about the patient's mental wellbeing. I expressed my current stressors, they gave me a counselor &amp; referred me to a place that was *supposed* to help with rent.
My partner took me there today when he was off work &amp; it turns out they're not the ones to help with rental issues. They gave me a list of those who do though.

After we got home, I asked some friends if my situation would be one that's valid enough for a GoFundMe &amp; they said it was worth a shot.
I made it about 4 hours ago &amp; have been doing my best to share it around. My goal only being a bit more than what I currently owe, as of writing this post, to ensure a place to stay until the end of my lease. So far I haven't gotten many donations, but its quite late in the US as of making the fundraiser, as well as this post.

Most of this is meant to be a vent, but I was also curious to know if there were any subs meant to share things like that, in an attempt to get a bit more traction before the end of the week.
I'm not sure if my landlord would be able, or is even willing, to do much more than what has already been done.",16Jul2019,1

Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first time
She was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh at mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
I was a youngin' straight crushin' tryna play this shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
'Cause when I seen 'em thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreaming, man what
I'm thinkin' how she ride on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
It make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions getting deeper
Wet dreaming thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said ""have you ever had sex before""

I wrote back and said ""of course I had sex before""
Knowing I was frontin'
I said I was like a pro baby
Knowing I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth I knew I'd get played out son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But, she don't know what
So she done roll back and told me
""Oh you a pro homie? Well I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday baby we can get to freakin'""
That's when my heart start racing and my body start sweatin'
Baby you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when playing on the bed
Teacher please don't make me stand up
I wrote back like ""Yeah baby sound like a plan""
Still trying to play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death my nigga, my stomach turned
Talking damn shit knowing damn well I was a virgin

You know that feelin' when you you finna bone for the first time
I'm hoping that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hoping that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all I'm praying God don't let me bust quick
I'm watching pornos tryin' see just how to stroke right
Practice putting condoms on, how it go right
I'm in a crib now a nigga palm sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touching and her face start blushing
And a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbing
On me, ooh girl don't stop
It's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah just how I practice
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said

47,"
I just turned 26 a few days ago, I had a horrible birthday (not that it matters in the grand scheme of things, I’m too old for birthdays I suppose) but I was forgotten and largely ignored by everyone, even my boyfriend. Which was majorly depressing. I tried not to be upset, but it would have been nice to get a phone call from my mom (who conveniently spent the last 9 birthdays in Florida) or flowers from the guy I’ve been dating for four months. My birthday is already a newly-sore day. I was born on my grandpas birthday, so until two years ago I always had someone to celebrate with. The family would get together and Grandpa and I did this “happy birthday! Oh you too!” Thing. After he passed, it became a sad day for everyone, and I feel guilty taking it for “my own” birthday now. Or even wanting to celebrate at all.
Being forgotten though, really hurt. I just marinated in guilt over being upset in the first place, then I started beating myself up about having a BA and not being able to find a job because I wasted two years in art school then majored in PSYCHOLOGY- leaving me 26, unmarried, and living with my parents. Who’d want to celebrate a loser anyway right? 
Not surprisingly- I broke out- HORRIBLY. I have horrendous hormonal acne that popped up AFTER high school. I know I need to avoid stress, hormonal acne is almost always made worse by stress, but this week just murdered my soul. Now my face is painful, ugly and I’m just flat out miserable and too embarrassed and wrapped up in my own self pity (yeah I know, I’m pathetic) to even go outside. 
I used the last bit of my advanced night repair (my secret weapon) during my LAST horrible breakout, but now 
Estée Lauder is way out of my price range. Fuck, EVERYTHING is out of my price range if I’m being responsible. And  the missha time revolution sets are just as expensive. It’s the only dupe I can find online. 
Is there a dupe out there for advanced night repair that I don’t know about? One that isn’t super expensive and I can maybe find on amazon and get relatively quickly?  Some magical serum  that I missed that heals and soothes and fades scarring? I don’t mean to sound whiney. And I know I’m
All over the place here. I just feel really awful right now, I need to VENT and I’m tired of spending hours on the Internet sifting through those “10 BEST products!” Lists that always have the same, new “fad” junk. 
As tempting as it is, there’s NO WAY I’m ever going to justify dropping 100$ on sk11 no matter how many times Chloe Mortez pops up on my newsfeed with her adorable kitty headband and perfect skin. 
I feel awful emotionally, Itd be nice to not have a swollen, throbbing face on top of it. 


This summer sucks. Turning 26 and not having a career or knowing what I’m supposed to do with my life sucks. My skin really REALLY sucks and here I am. I don’t have anyone to talk to, and even if I did, I know that my “problems” are my own fault and other things just take time. I just hurt inside and out and feel like a massive loser.

Some fools brought their families too, including children. I will never forget the sight of burning flesh peeling away from an infant's face as their mother turned to ash.

Butch women are amazing, strong but sensitive, they unashamedly own their truth and don't care if you have a problem with them. The butch girls I have dated  tend to have a cocky, outgoing nature but can be sweet and sentimental when dating.

53,"i am an 18 year old female in the USA who is about to start college. there is a girl who bullied me bad starting in elementary school (like bad, she had a plan to kill me IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL). i tried to befriend her (lets call her emma) in middle school and it got way worse and severely impacted my self esteem. this rooted several mental health issues i have dealt with over the years. i gave her many second chances because i was naive and thought she had changed but she obviously had some mental issues. to give you an idea, she basically stalked several people and had pictures of their houses on her phone and even followed a guy home one day (who didnt even know who she was). she moved away right after eigth grade so i thankfully didnt have to see her in high school. the thing is, she doesnt even realize that she ever hurt me and she never once apologized over those years even though i told her many times. i ran into her once in public about a year ago and she acted like we were best friends. several of my aquaintences were in contact with her through high school and have said she is still insane and hasnt treated them well at all (i never asked for details because i didnt want to pry, they didnt want to talk about it). a couple of weeks ago, my friend (who is good friends with emma) texted me “hey, emma is going to the same university as you and she is going to look for you.” i found out from that same friend that emma has been in a mental institution for over a year and just got out. after doing a little instagram stalking, i found out that emma is not only going to my university (which is fine), but she will be living in the same dorm building as me. im 18 now and ive obviously forgiven her, but i havent forgotten and i just dont want her in my life again. i am thinking about carrying pepper spray because i dont even know what shes like now. i want to make it clear to her that i dont want to be her friend but i dont want to be on bad terms either, since we will be living in the same building. i know that i am much stronger now and i can damn well stand up for myself if she pulls anything but i just want to start fresh and make new friends in college and not have any negativity from the past. she sent me a facebook friend request today which i denied, but im worried that she will try to reach out more. i dont want an apology because ive already forgiven her, all i want is for her to not get involved in my life. i hate to post about this because its just so ridiculous and im not trying to be a victim but i just really need some advice on what to do here😅 i want to handle this in as much of a respectful way as i can. thanks",16Jul2019,1
54,"So, I'm still pretty new to this and this seems like the place to post this on, but if there's somewhere better I can post this on then please tell me. Also, English isn't my first language, so if I make a simple mistake then don't berate me for it. This will also be a long post, so I am sorry about that. 

So I have this friend that I met around 8 months ago. He's not my best friend or anything, but we've hung out a couple of times and we get along pretty well. We talk, and as I've been kind of open about myself and how it has been for me growing up, he thinks that we're pretty alike. The thing is though that for quite some time he has been kind of pestering me that I probably have something with me that is not quite normal(for my lack of better words to describe it). So obviously I would get angry by his comment, saying I'm completely normal and disregard what he said. 
Anyways, he said it again a couple of days ago, and instead of doing what I usually do, I calmed down, and asked him what he meant in detail. His explanation was that I probably had some super light form of Aspergers or something I believe is called Atypical Autism. He meant that he recognised signs of it since he has Aspergers himself. We ended conversation there without any hurt feelings, but a spark of curiosity lit up in my mind since I usually want to prove him wrong in his statements, something I've succeeded in many times before. 
So, I did a little bit of research, and honestly, some of the signs checked in on me. I won't go over all of it since that would make this post way to long. 
Since I was born, it took about until the age of 3 until I could speak, and even though I say that, my speech was still very unclear, as well with my understanding of what was said to me and the meaning of what they said. I've never been a very social kid, as those thing has always been very hard for me. I was also bullied in school from 3rd grade until the 7th, and the only reason it stopped was because I changed to a new school, a place were I managed to get some new friends and even a girlfriend that lasted for 1 year. The thing is that when I was bullied, they wouldn't usually go after me physically and start fights since I was unusually much stronger for a kid my age that never had trained in his life, but would always get into verbal arguments and abuse since I was helpless with words. 
If I was to state a special interest of mine, it would be Origami, something I've done since I was 5. Otherwise it would be games, anime and looking up certain stuff that I've had a certain interest in. I've also been somewhat of a genius when it comes to learning languages ironically enough, and it's one of the only school subjects that I actually wanted to focus on during the lessons and got straight A's in it all of the time because of it.
I wouldn't say that I live by a super planned schedule as having certain meals on certain days, but more something I have routines in. For an example, I always train between 16:30 - 18:00 with some preparations beforehand so that I can go exactly that time. Alterations can be made, but if it's something that I can't foresee that delays this I usually get a bit upset. Also stuff like how I walk in the street, count the amount of steps in a stairway to see if there's an uneven amount of them, among various other things as well.

There's a lot that I didn't include in this long post in order to prevent it from being any longer. So with all of this considered, I might suspect that my friend might be right after all, and it might be something worth to look up when I have a chance to do so. But what do you guys think?
Are these signs of either Aspergers or atypical autism? Please let me know and of course I will answer any of your questions. Sorry for making this long, but I wanted to make sure to get out as much information as possible. Thanks for reading!",16Jul2019,1

Anyways - 3 weeks ago I applied for a position open here as well as one of the other girls from our friend group. She applied based off my advice of telling her to and that it only made her look better and like she wanted advancement and at the worst they’d say no. She was aware I put in my application also. 

The guy from our friend group (50) was on vacation when the position was posted but was aware of it through our group chat. He returned from vacation and the job posting had closed but after 2 weeks of begging him to fill out a paper to apply he refused and stated he felt the job should just be given to him if they want him to do it.

So yesterday after an interview I got the job. Shit hit the mother fuckin fan. My supervisor/50 year old friend in the group started punching walls, calling me a fucking bitch in front of members and coworkers, telling other coworkers to be careful speaking to me, telling me my ass kissing paid off he guesses, refusing to work and telling everyone to give me their shit because I can clearly handle it.

When he told one of my coworkers/friend in the group 27 to be careful talking to me she told him she wasn’t and was trying to find her outage.. but she was talking to me.

Moral of the story I hate them both now basically and have zero respect for either of them. We clearly weren’t a family or even friends if this dumbass position meant more 🙄",16Jul2019,7

Because I go to the same exact restaurants, I've been getting along with the employees and some of the managers, to a point where sometimes, they will prioritize the order when I arrive or they already know why I am at the restaurant for, so they just ask for the name and hand me the order. Some were even nice enough to give me a drink if the order was going to take a while longer, even though it never happens at certain restaurants. There are also times that some of the employees start asking me about my overall experience with doing this, in which I do not mind at all answering, since I think it's pretty cool that I've gotten along well enough to become friends with them, even though I only see them for a few minutes. Some of the restaurants told me I'm a driver that comes a lot there and some of them admit that they are my favorite to a point where they started to call me by my first name, in which I do not find it creepy at all. It's almost a year now since I've started doing this and I've completed around 3,000 deliveries. There is this one restaurant that took it a step further I did not expect at all.
​
Last Friday afternoon, I got a request at a certain restaurant like normal. The manager was there and asked me if I was here for the order, I said yes like always and waited for everything to be done. This was the first time I saw the manager at that restaurant. While I was waiting, some of the employees were starting to talk about me with the manager. I couldn't hear the conversation, but I heard the words ""Grubhub"" and ""he comes here a lot"". I thought they were just expressing their gratitude towards me since it sometimes happens. When the manager offered me the food, she asked me. ""Are you interested in being a delivery driver for our restaurant during lunch hours?"" Inside of me, I was surprised that someone literally offered me a delivery position. She says that they want to hire their own personal delivery driver for certain days of the week for certain orders and this is the first time. I said I was really interested, but since I was on an active order, we couldn't talk about the details, so she wrote down her work email address on a piece of paper and said if I'm interested, send an email. I went on my way. I did not get any more requests from that restaurant for some reason, maybe because it was busy and other restaurants were getting busy.
​
I thought about it during the day thinking: Was I the only driver that was offered this job? I mean, if I was, I guess my professionalism really paid off since I got along with the employees at the restaurant and I guess I was qualified for it since they saw it...I do not know. There could have been a lot of factors and maybe they found someone else. After thinking about it more, I decided to email her back with other questions before I will make the decision the next day. Worst case scenario, the offer is no longer available. After I sent her the email with my questions. I surprisingly got a response 10 minutes later with all the answers. Because my answers were exactly I wanted them to be and it fits in my college schedule, I decided to say yes to the offer! A few hours later, I got an email attachment of the employee applications and I was going to start Monday!  
​
Monday was an amazing experience!  The manager is amazing!  She treats the employees like family and takes care of them and she's dedicated to run a small business.  She was happy that I accepted the offer.  I asked her if there was other drivers that got the offer.  She said I was the only one!  

I honestly never thought of being a self-employed driver that is simply getting the food for the customer will go a long way to a point where someone recognized me and offered me something I enjoy doing.  I'm so glad I accepted that order when it was requested to me.  I do not know what will happen if I rejected it.  I cannot wait to part of a team I already know, but at a different level :)",16Jul2019,2
66,"I saw a story recently about a teacher sentenced to 20 years for having sex with a 13 year old boy. My first reaction was that’s a bit of a harsh sentence, she doesn’t seem like a dangerous predator, I don’t think the boy would be all that harmed by the experience.

But then I recalled a guy I knew in college called Stan. He told us a story about how he was sleeping with one of his female friends mothers during high school ... she would pick him up from school, take him back to her house before her husband got in and do lots of kinky shit with him. He seemed like he enjoyed it a lot, and we enjoyed hearing the story and respected him for this.

I didn’t hear from him for over 10 years until I bumped into him at a party recently. We started catching up, and I asked him if he was in a relationship. Turns out he’s been dating much older women ever since high school, his current girlfriend being 50 (him 29). And as you would expect there were problems in this relationship and all others he’d had to date, all with much older women.

My conclusion is that the woman he lost his virginity to on high school, in shaping his sexual preferences, has robbed him the opportunity to have a family and to grow old with someone his own age. It’s sad.",16Jul2019,0

But this morning when I was in the shower, which has a very big mirror on the wall next to it and no curtains, I looked at myself from a few different angles. I squinted my eyes a little, looking for flaws. Posed a bit. And it hit me... I look hot! I'm hot stuff. I look good!!! I never really felt that way. I always felt like shit. Like I was doing this whole 'fake it, till you make it' thing. But now, it felt... real. Like a sudden moment of seeing the light.

We recently stayed at a friends house and I couldn't tell if she was dropping any hints, and shed always been very friendly with me. Well we've been texting over discord recently, and yesterday she texted me at around 9 am, and she said she needed to talk to me about something. I wasn't awake, I had gone to bed at 5am for some odd reason. Due to our conflicting schedules and her crappy stepdad, we hardly ever really get into a conversation where the messages aren't hours apart. I told her yesterday we could talk about it after I got back from town, but I didnt get home until much later than expected. I told her sorry (she didnt answer, probably asleep) and said good morning at around eight. I can wait patiently until she answers, but this whole time I've been wondering if thisll be a confession.

80,"Some years ago, there was a murder in my town. I live in a small close-knit town so murders generally make themselves into the papers whenever they do happen. I remember reading the paper one morning about a 17 year old who was found dead in his car.

A witness reported that the victim was last seen at a restaurant the night of the murder eating dinner with three of his friends. He was not seen alive again.

The cause of death was strangulation and he had bruises on his body. The boy had a girlfriend and I recall this was either right before or actually on valentine's day.

The three friends were ruled out as suspects and there were no convictions. No motive was revealed and the case is still unsolved. There is apparently a Rob Gavagan video on this specific case but I can't find it anywhere. I'd really wish to find it, as I feel it'd offer closure. Other than that there is no mention of him aside from that newspaper which made me feel sad.

Every month or other month I go visit the cemetary and put flowers on his grave because I feel sad that his likely murderers got away with it, he was killed while alone at night by his friends for no reason, and because it seems like most people don't even acknowledge he existed.",16Jul2019,8
82," 

I've always had several good friends all my life. I used to hang out with friends alot on my free time, almost every day.

But as time went on, more and more of them started to meet other people (we used to hang out together).

It's right before summer break and alot of my friends are hanging out with other people and often when i would ask it would be something like ""Sorry im having a sleepover with someone"" That just made me feel very uninvited, like no one wanted me there. That whole summer no one ever asked me to hang out, i asked them a few times and some times it was a yes, but i feel like they did it because they didnt want to have a fight or felt bad. I usually saw on snapchat and simular stuff people posting about them having a sleepover or hanging out with the people i used to hang out with. Everyone is there, exept for me. The problem is not that im not nice or something, im generally very well behaved, i never had a fight with enyone, we usually have fun when we do hang out, but everything just slipped out of my hands. The cooming winter this just kept on going, each time making me more sad. I usually dont cry but its getting more common, i just keep all of this inside of me, wich makes me more and more sad. Wich obviously doesnt help the situation. As spring come im also starting to see my friends not opening my texts or snaps, or not just responding. Nothing has changed yet and i feel it has to pretty soon. Summer break just started and i really dont know what to do. And at this point as the title says i feel kind of ashamed for asking people to hang out, I cant really explain why. I think its because i feel they dont want to hang out. I need some drastic changes pretty soon before this starts effecting all of my life.

85,"TL;DR:
Wah-wah-wah, blah-blah-blah, boo-hoo me. I'll get right again eventually, I just realize something's got to give. (Let the bodies hit the floor.)

((Debated putting this in r/mentalhealth but this is more a note to self than requesting a diagnosis, more just getting out thoughts in hopes I can stop thinking about them for even a moment... And I apologize now for the long post.))

I've been having a ridiculously hard month. Lots of unwanted drama in my own relationships (I should probably mention I am polyamorous and married), and dealing with best friends seeking out drama in their own relationships. All the romance failing has definitely caused depression, I am an old-school romantic to my core and despite my best efforts relationships hold a lot of weight on my happiness. 

In my own relationships I've been trying to balance giving my new long-distance partner space as they deal with some struggles in their own life and show them love while still trying to tell myself I am loved by them. It's been really hard on me mentally, I have learned in this process that long breaks don't do me any favors mentally. Instead they make me feel insecure, helpless, selfish for wanting to reach out to my love, and selfish for feeling neglected. Which is ironic in a way because I tend to try to take ""breaks"" daily by way of hiking for hours on end in places that have no cell reception. (Being a mom, a wife, a gf, a friend, and a woman with my own aspirations gets overwhelming if I don't give myself some nature therapy... Even if nature has become more of self-defense practice lately than refreshing.) As much as I love my boyfriend, I feel very unsure on what he is going to decide what he needs. And being in limbo has me constantly thinking about meeting someone new which is a super shitty feeling because I am a loyalist. But that we have been on hold for nearly a month... I would feel so stupid if I waited around a month to find out he doesn't want to be with me. I was so ready to really fall in love and let someone in.


In my marriage I've been doing everything I can to reconnect with my husband of nearly 9 years in meaningful ways since he has gone back to working nights with 55+ hour work weeks. It's been really hard lately trying to balance my need for adventure + my husband's need for being politically active + our need to spend time together + parenting. We have been kind of falling apart slowly and talked long and hard this weekend about it. I am still emotional from crying all weekend, having hard talks with my husband are often extremely emotionally draining for me because he has a tendency to shut down. We have been really working hard to find common interests (other than Netflix) we can do together that combines our individual interests... On top of raising kids. Instead of hearing the words I am saying (""honey, I MISS you. I feel like we have nothing in common and we are drifting apart. What do we do?"") His anxiety heard the words he thought I was really trying to say (""you bore me. I hate this marriage. We have nothing in common. You suck for not trying."") The good news is my husband and I talked in length through the tears to work on this, and have a camping trip planned for this weekend. I am hoping it is the reset we both have been needing. 

The drama that is my friends... It's frustrating going through relationship struggles that feel real and heartfelt to me (missing one partner, trying to reconnect and rebuild a relationship with another), and seeing my friends SEEK OUT drama in their own relationships. Choosing toxic behaviors instead of taking their own advice of seeking couples and personal therapy... Taking breaks from toxic partners so everyone can get the professional help they need. Instead said friends have been making some petty decisions knowing there are some SERIOUSLY detrimental results, but making these decisions anyway. (Long story short I have had to reevaluate my relationships with my 2 friends I have had around the longest because they have been choosing to destroy other people's lives [like 25-life jail time, and CPS taking autistic kids away from family kind of ruin] because someone unfriended them on Facebook and they had dirt on that person. What. The. Actual. Fuck.)

I am going through all the depression feels because no relationship I have currently (friend or otherwise) is in a healthy, happy state no matter how good I try to be for the other person. I tend to keep small social groups but I love all the people in my life ENDLESSLY and have been known to fall on the knife to spare others pain quite a few times. And it's definitely catching up to me. Even though I know I shouldn't be living my life for others, I need to focus on my own happiness too. But part of what makes me happy is seeing those I love thriving.


I usually use hiking and trail running to burn through the energy, and the time to process various stresses in my life. But nature has turned hostile lately in all the areas I frequent (coyote attacks, bears, fires.) And what was once my sanctuary has turned into anxiety attacks. So now I have to invite people to go with which means I have to compromise how much of a workout I get, the therapeutic quiet that is nature, and the times at which I get to hike (I am a sunrise addict. Not many are early risers.) Soooo, I have been dieting to compensate for the lack of working out. Let me just say lack of carbs hasn't helped the depression at all. I know giving into carbs will make me feel worse if my weight goes up though, so it's all I can do to find the happy medium. 


I've been driving into music, writing, swimming, and focusing on art projects. It's all I can do to keep myself from wishing I were hiking, wishing I were eating 25 bags of Cheetos, wishing I were flirting and loving on my loves, or seeking out new, healthy relationships. 

I keep reminding myself that after this weekend I will have the answers I need regarding 1 relationship, the connection I long for regarding another relationship, and the no-cell reception I need to popitely distance myself from toxic friends. I am going to give myself slightly more carbs and time to swim until then, to relieve stress  until I can get the answers or closure I need.

After this week, I choose me. Whatever that means.",16Jul2019,0

90,"Seriously, that is all it takes.

Want a better world? More economic growth, healthier foods, less crime? Do everything out of love. And insist the people you elect to represent you are doing the same.

I honestly believe there isn't a single problem on earth that can't be solved if we start from first principles of ""love everyone.""

Poverty. Economists know what solves poverty. Giving people long term hope. No strings attached cash payments that are stable over a long period of time. Young single mothers who dropped out of school will, by and large, when giving a stable check sufficient to cover their needs + some more, start planning for the future. They'll go back to school, save money for a rainy day, starting feeding their kids better food[1]. Not everyone will of course, but the majority will, and the cycle of poverty will be broken. This has been proven time and time again, demonstrated in test programs around the world.

If we truly cared for those women, if we truly loved those kids, we'd institute these programs immediately. Over the long term they cost less, and often times switching from expensive to administer benefits programs that require constant reapplication and eligibility verification, to pure cash payments, is either break even *or cheaper*, even taking into account that (small!) % of people will abuse the program[2].

But we don't care. Instead our current programs are [built around scorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_queen), scorn created by a propaganda campaign that was built around [lies and racism](https://www.newamerica.org/weekly/edition-135/rise-and-reign-welfare-queen/)

The people we elected to implement those programs were not acting out of love. It was obvious to everyone who voted for them. The politicians running for office made us angry, and we voted our anger. If we had voted our love, hundreds of thousands if not millions of Americans would have been lifted out of generational poverty.

In the 90s my liberal west coast city cut funding to a number of childhood intervention programs. The foster care system was, and is, underfunded. Child welfare workers were, and are, over burdened. Children are horribly abused, and we as a society voted to ""tighten the budget"" because our own pocket books were more important than acting with love and compassion.

A generation later, the streets are filled with homeless, a generation of lost children who have grown up without hope. We ask why an abused child, now grown, can't just suck it up and get a job. We judge them for using drugs to dull the pain from physical, psychological, and sexual abuse. And society starts shouting out that they all should either be locked up and forgotten about, or physically forced out of the city.

We acted without love, and our sins come back to haunt us. We continue to act without love, without compassion. When the city tries to build housing for the homeless, people sue en-masse to stop the construction. Whenever a shelter goes up, people sue. When a church tries to open its doors to help, far too often lawyers are called in to make sure no good deed goes unpunished.

None of that is acting with love in our hearts. Problems that would be a fraction of their current size if we compassionate towards our fellows have become societal crises because we acted out of scorn, spendthrift, or just apathy.

Do everything out of love. Vote out of love. When someone is trying to convince you of something, ask if the emotions they are creating are positive, or negative. Are they trying to rile you up so you turn on your fellows? If so, that it not someone you should be listening to.

Such policies and actions are not only bad for the soul of the country, but they are bad policies in general. Economically they make no sense, and they make no sense for long term stability of society.

[1] Just ensuring adequate childhood nutrition raises test scores dramatically, high school graduation rates shoot up, crime drops, employment increases. Comprehensive childhood nutrition programs *pay for themselves* in reducing net losses to society. 

[2] Think of it like supermarkets, they could put in enough security checks to drop thefts down to 0, but that would be more expensive than just allowing for some small amount of theft. For that matter, would you go shopping at a store where you were followed around by security 100% of the time and patted down every 5 minutes? Of course not. But that is analogous to what people trying to get food stamps to feed their kids have to go through.",16Jul2019,1
91,"My mother is among the best teachers I’ve ever known. When I was in third grade, I couldn’t wait to grow up faster so I could finally be her pupil. She was teaching sixth graders. Her classroom looked like a planetarium. She drew and cut out the planets herself. She had the awesomest classroom in our school.

I was in fifth grade when she left the country. She applied to be a domestic helper in Hong Kong. During those times, a maid in HK made more than a teacher in the Philippines. We were all told the success stories, of Chinese employers migrating to Canada or the US, bringing their maids with them and with that in mind, my father sold his jeepney so my mother could be a maid. And maybe with luck on our side, she might even go to the US.

She came back after a month. She couldn’t take it. They made her hang her clothes beside the rugs she used to mop their floors. She was only allowed to eat a few slices of bread so if she finished it and still felt hungry, she would go to bed with a rumbling stomach. They wouldn’t even share their leftovers. When she came back, I remember her looking so frail. I was just a kid. I didn’t know what was really happening. My father lost his jeepney for nothing. My mother was diagnosed with a cervical tumor. They didn’t have savings for her treatment. And I didn’t have a clue what they were going through. I was just glad my mother’s back with us and that she arrived with chocolates.

On rare occasions, my father would buy us chocolates and they’re called Curly Tops. They cost around 20 pesos. A dollar could get you two boxes of those.

“Life is like a box of chocolates. You’ll never know what you’re gonna get.”

I was in high school when I saw Forrest Gump and this sentence never made sense to me. How can you not know what you’re gonna get? Every piece of chocolate in the box looks and tastes exactly the same.

Fast forward to college, my then-boyfriend (now husband) visited me in the Philippines for the first time and he bought me a box of chocolates. The box looked really special and expensive and when I opened it, every piece looked amazing. I ate one after another.

And that’s the only time the famous movie quote made sense to me.

Movies were never a luxury. You can buy a pirated DVD for 50 pesos in the market and it would contain 20 to 30 movies. Me and my sister grew up watching every Tinkerbell and Barbie and Disney movies this way. My family owned a television. It was really tiny but it felt huge because we were tiny too.

Then one day, I went to study in Manila and at 15 years old, I entered a movie theater for the first time in my life. The movie ticket was expensive but it was so worth it. I didn’t know movies were supposed to be watched that way. Suddenly everything was huge, loud, bright and beautiful.

These experiences somehow answer the question how it’s like to be extremely poor. But looking back, I never felt like we were poor. In fact, I thought we so lucky we had a jeepney to sell, I had boxes of chocolates to share with my sister and a TV to watch our movies. These are privileges we get to have for having parents who have stable jobs. Most of my classmates didn’t have televisions at home. After school, they would go to their parents farm to help them harvest tomatoes or pull out weeds. I had second hand sneakers my father bought in a thrift store. Their slippers had holes in them probably from walking for so long only to have sweet potato as their lunch and snacks.

I never had to walk so far. I never had to eat sweet potatoes all the time. I was given 5 pesos during break time and that would buy a cup of soup or noodles and juice in our canteen.

In our village, it’s common to have bathrooms and toilets with walls made out of sacks of rice. You can poke a hole through them. My family was lucky enough to have concrete walls though it didn’t have a roof. You’d have to hurry washing yourself if it was raining. But when it isn’t and the sun has set, you’d have the luxury of watching the stars while taking a dump.

I’ve lived in three different places in the Philippines and I’ve seen three different kinds of extreme poverty.

In our little village, children would wake up early to go and pick edible ferns by the side of the river and would sell them house to house in bundles. Sometimes, it would be the fishes they caught, clams they collected or sweet potato tops from their parents farms.

I was eleven when I decided I wanted to study in a city that’s hours away from home. That was the first time I ever saw a person begging on the streets asking for coins.

I was fifteen when I got accepted to a university in Manila. On the streets, I saw families living under umbrellas with cardboard boxes as their walls. Their children breathing through plastics bags containing toluene-based substances. They smell of paint thinners. With 5 pesos, you can buy a bottle of it to get a cheap high. A cheap high to escape hunger.

I don’t think I can tell you what it’s like to be extremely poor. After seeing how a lot of people struggled around me, it never once occurred to me that we were extremely poor.

Not even that one Christmas night we didn’t have anything to cook.",16Jul2019,67
92,"To start off, sometimes I lack social skills and I struggle with panic attacks. Here's a bit of how I felt about the situation, and just straight up what happened and what I did wrong. From the beginning of the year, my college roommate and I would talk a little bit and stuff, but as the 1st semester went on, she was really quiet. I will say she was out of the room more than me, but when she was in the room, she never talked to me first. I would sometimes try to be friendly like offering her cookies. She would say, ""No, I'm good."" I just got bad vibes from her. She didn't smile enough, and when she did, it looked fake. Then, mid-semester, she started doing things that bothered me, such as changing menstrual pads in the dorm room (our beds are lofted, so I never saw her do it, but I could hear the wrapper and I know she threw them in the trash. She at least wrapped them, but still), leaving her desk light on way too late/early, not taking out the trash as much as me, and leaving her laundry basket in the way. Eventually, we had bed bugs. I asked her if we were going to get reimbursed for this, and she looked uncomfortable and didn't say anything. Then I was like, ""You don't know, do you?"" She said, ""Yeah, sorry Idk."" She was super grumpy the day we bagged our stuff (due to the bugs) and slammed the door. She also glared at me a few times.

Honestly, I just decided to tell the RA it wasn't a friendly environment, I was scared my roommate would judge me and I didn't feel safe. The RA talked to my roommate and we eventually had a meeting together. My roommate was super irritated because I didn't talk to her first about the issues I had and she didn't believe I was intimidated by her. She said that personal issues should be discussed with the roommate first, because that's what ""mature adults do."" She said, ""I don't believe you're scared."" I responded, ""That's because I told my parents about this, and they told me not to act scared so I don't give you power.""She was like, ""...But you weren't even friendly?!"" I replied, ""I offered you cookies! and you blew me off!""  When the RA asked about hygiene during the roommate agreement, I said, ""Sanitary napkins should be changed in the bathroom, and I looked this up-body fluids spread disease and pests and that also makes me feel unsafe."" The RA asked my roommate if that was okay with her and she just nodded. By the end of our meeting, she signed the agreement and burst out of the room crying...That night she packed a small bag and slept somewhere else..

2nd semester, she apologized for making me feel uncomfortable and brought me oreos. I agreed that we didn't need anymore tension in the room, and then everything was fine. However, my guy friend started talking to her even after I told him the weird stuff she did. One day he invited her to go to the mall with us when it was just supposed to be us 2 (She hesitated and he was like, ""maybe another time?"" She said, ""Yeah!""). I was worried she would talk behind my back, which is why I asked him individually why he wanted to be friends with her. Then, one day she suggested we get dinner once a week to just talk and make sure we touch base. I agreed, we set up a date. On the day we planned, she asked what time I usually eat dinner. I was like, ""It depends."" She didn't mention it again and we just stopped talking the rest of the semester.

Eventually, my college roommate sent me this long text at the end of the year, confronting me for everything I said to her. She basically said I had a condescending attitude, that I was judgmental, and she didn't understand why I wanted to be a psychologist because I judge people who ""aren't happy"". For example, one time (in person) she said, ""I'm not trying to avoid the room or anything, I'm just not here most of the time because I've been working a lot."" I said, ""Oh, I don't have a job because my parents have good jobs, and I got lots of scholarships because I'm smart, or at least that's what people say."" She also was talking casually about how she hoped her skin didn't look too oily. I was like, ""let me see."" She says, ""uhh no...."" I was like, don't worry I won't judge."" I got up in her face and looked at her skin and said, ""Oh, you just have large pores. I have small ones."" She also showed me her theatre headshots a different day, because she wanted her top 10 chosen for the photographer to edit. I said, ""To edit this, I would take out the red part on your forehead, and then sculpt your cheekbones, but idk what the acting industry likes"". She also asked me one time if the school's internet was working for me, because it wasn't for her. I responded, ""Yes, I have unlimited data on my phone.""

She also mentioned that I was rude for offering her one of my dresses for one of her auditions. I asked what she was wearing and she said, ""one of those dresses."" I looked at her clothes and then offered her one of my dresses, which she rejected. (This was during 1st semester, before the RA meeting)Then, at the beginning of the year during welcome week, she showed me a craft she made at an event and asked me if I made one. I responded, ""No, I'm not really into material things. I'm more into making memories."" There was also a time she auditioned for something in August during fall semester. I asked her how it went and she said she was really nervous but she was happy to get it over with. I said, ""I mean, you're not an A class actor, but for what you're trying to do, it was pretty good. You didn't need to worry."" She also said she was aware I talked behind her back to my guy friend. Those were just a few things she confronted me about in her text.",16Jul2019,0

94,"So this last senior year I ended up developing a huge crush on this girl. I always thought she was attractive since like freshman year of highschool, but I never really had any reason to be near or approach her. We ended up sharing one class senior year. 2nd day of school the teacher allowed us to pick our seats, and I ended up coming like a min late and practically all the tables(3-4 students) were filled out. There were only a couple spots available and none by any of my friends. Teacher told me I had to sit down, and my crush told me to come sit at her table with 2 of her friends. I decided to cuz why not. I'm smart, so I assumed that was possibly the reason. I'm a reasonably social person, but I'm usually shy the first week of school until I get back into the groove. We had a worksheet that required knowledge from a previous class that a lot of people in the class too, except I didn't. The teacher asked us to work on it, and since I was kinda shy at this table and didn't know how to do it, I just sat there confused trying to figure it out. My crush saw me and asked if I needed any help on it, explained it to me, and checked in on me again after I did it and asked if I understood it or not. Fast forward to later that month, one girl at the table suggested to make a groupchat for our table for that class and asked me if I wanted to be in it. I gave her my phone number. A couple days after that, my crush asked if I knew whose number was which in the groupchat and asked me for mine. Later that day, she added me on snapchat. She also requested to follow me on Instagram a couple months later after I just had made one. I snapped her that next day a random pic just to see if she would respond and she did. We kept snapping back and forth for a day until she randomly left me on open. I decided not to double snap. Two days went by without a snap and then she finally snapped me. It went back and forth again and then she left me on open late evening but this time she snapped me next morning. Pattern continued from October to December. Obviously, we got a streak and frequently snapped unless she left me on open. I usually responded to all her snaps until one week I decided just to respond once a day for the streak and then ignore her. Twice that week she blue messaged me random questions about that class that were pretty useless tbh. In class, she always used to ask me for help whenever she had a question(cuz I'm smart). We talked a decent amount then(mostly about the class). However, our teacher reorganized the seating assignments in like late October and I didn't get to sit next to her anymore. Since then, I didn't talk in person with her at all, but I kept snapping her. I drew up conversation with her a couple times by responding to her story and talking about if she was ready for a test, and she seemed really nice and had decent responses. Sometimes, I tried sparking a convo by saying a statement instead of a question, but in those instances, she usually just replied with a selfie(like all her snaps). Anyways, December to February she started to never leave me on open and started responding super quickly(sometimes in like a couple second or even minutes even if I took hours to respond). If I had to guess, I'd say she's shy except with her friends and girls. Doesn't really talk to many guys. In class when I didn't sit by her, I got a lot of attention from the teacher since I was smart and aced tests but didn't do homework. A lot of the times I got called out, everyone looked at me and a lot of times she looked at me and smiled. One time I could even hear my name in the convo I think she was saying I was super smart and then looked across the room and smiled at me(doesn't mean anything I know). Anyways, in February she went to a school dance with a dude from another school and through researching, I found out she was dating and had been doing so since early December, which surprised me because her snap frequency and response time really started becoming really good then. I became salty after finding out she was dating, and I cut the 100+ day streak we had because either way we didn't really talk in person anymore and she didn't start convos over snap. She still kept snapping me for a week after I cut the streak until I blue chatted her that I didn't want one. Two months later, I find out she broke up and a couple weeks after that I sent her a snap, and she left me on open. I didn't want to snap her again, so I just left it at that and she never responded back. 



I just want to know if there were any clear signs I should've pursued and asked her out here, or was it all ambiguous and meaningless tbh? I know I should've asked her out either way in the beginning cuz it seemed like she was really interested, but I had limitations. I was kinda addicted to seeing her hot selfies all the time on snapchat and wish I didn't cut our streak since she ended up breaking up because now I basically have no contact with her now. We are going to the same college this fall, but I feel like she hates me now but I still have a major crush on her that I am unable to get over. You think there's any way I could reach out to her when it starts?

TLDR- girl asked me to sit by her, always asked me questions in class whenever she was confused, added me on snap and Instagram, asked for my phone number, and responded to my snaps all the time and quickly. Also tested me(I think) by leaving me on open for two days after we snapped the whole day after she added me first. Smiled at me a lot of times in class and sometimes talked about how smart I was to other people. I cut our streak off(100+) after I found out she was dating and told her to stop snapping me. Snapped her a couple months later after I knew she broke up with bf and she didn't respond. Does she hate me now and did I have a chance or clear signs she liked me for getting her? Any chance or idea of how to reconnect with her in college this fall(we are going to same one)?",16Jul2019,0

98," *Disclamier: I an thrity-five virgin who never even kissed a girl*

I'm thirty-five and am so starved of human affection and intimacy I have lost my goddamn mind. Social isolation actually shrinks grey matter, it damages the brain. Isolation cells is prisons have been shown to actually drive men mad.

The thing that gets me, is that I'm probably not even capable of having a wife and family now. I'm too damaged. But I wasn't always. I made good money, stayed away from drugs. I was tall and kept myself in shape. I went to parties and was actively social. I did all the things I was supposed to do, except hit on women. Because women told me the new system was to wait for women to hit on me.

Whenever I tried to talk about it I ended up being abused, mocked and shamed by women.

I genuinely fear I'm going to end up a rapist or mass murderer. I'm certain that I will eventually kill myself. Then some useless feminist is going to say it's because I couldn't express my feelings.

Here are my feeling: I hate women. I hate this revolting culture the West has produced. I have begun to feel that men who rape and kill women are brave freedom fighters, doing their small part in striking back against our tormentors.

102,"Ok so I made this Reddit because I don't know how to express these thoughts anywhere else and I'm afraid it's going to be too long and useless for anybody to care. Still trying this. 

So, I'm 27 and officially single for 6 years. 
I broke up with with my partner who I loved cause we were both kinda unhappy and I felt unsupported. They said they wouldn't do xy, turned around and did it again. Just no emotional support or standing true to their word. 
I have some problems with these things and they knew. We've actually been friends for about 8 years (age 11 to 19)  before we got together for 2,5 years. They cried and talked with me about it, but I knew neither of us would be happy. 

Afterwards they immediately went and got somebody new, telling her all the things they told me before (saw it publicly on Facebook) and it ended any lingering feelings in me, cause when you truly believe you had something special even though it ended and they turn around and do sth like that not s month later, well it's shit.

I've had another friend for a few years then and we had a strong connection all the while but I never acted on these feeling cause I was in a relationship. When I was single she had a relationship and let's say the girlfriend kinda resembled me. 

So now we met about every week and the feelings got stronger. It's probably important to note that we had a threesome with her and my partner which was amazing, so that didn't make it any easier.

After some time she cheated on her girlfriend with me. I'm not proud of that and she wasn't either, but it wasn't just sex. We had an incredible chemistry and she did and said everything I ever wanted and some I needed and didn't know. So I fell hard and she apparently did too. 

Talked about her breaking up and she KNEW all of my issues with trust, feelings and especially love. Still pursued me and did everything she could to win me over. Finally she told me she's in love with me. I'm not exaggerating at all when I say I almost hyperventilated and choked on my words but I managed to say I felt like that too. She got me to hold hands with her and if you're wondering why that's a big deal, I hardly could do it the first few times cause it always felt too much for me, like too much emotion and anxiety.  Again, I'm not good at this. 

So she got me to the ""point of no return"". We even discussed a relationship, I even told her I couldn't imagine not being monogamous even though I had to hold that option open for me in my past relationship, even though I never acted on it and my ex didn't either. It was just a ""we could do it"" phrase, to keep us mentally steady (my ex and I both had a bit of a problem you see).
I'm not saying open relationships or polyamory are rooted in problems, not at all, I'm very open to this and can see myself in that dynamic as long as it's healthy. But with her after all the shit and turmoil I just wanted her and no one else. And as ridiculous this may sound given that she cheated on her girlfriend, she was fiercely monogamous.

She said she'd break up and to make it short, she didn't. She said she's a coward and couldn't do it, so she ""broke up"" with me. 
To say the least I was heartbroken, like she actually broke me. I never wanted to feel something like that and she made all my nightmares come true. I sound dramatic but for a year I dreamed of her every night, my friends hate her because they witnessed what I was going through. 
And the years after weren't easy either. 

That happened in 2013. Until 2017 I couldn't even imagine being interested in someone. Sometime in 2014 I accidentally found her number and couldn't resist writing her just asking how she could do that to me, not in a dramatic way, I just told her I was still trying to understand how someone was able to hurt another in such a way after pursuing them and CONCIOUSLY doing everything they could to make the other fall in love. I know it was consciously cause she told me she wanted me to fall in love with her. 
Her answer was that apparently at that moment she THOUGHT her feelings were that strong, but in hindsight they weren't. Basically ""whoops I misjudged myself"". She was ""terribly sorry"" that our deep friendship got destroyed because of all of this. 
I told her she did the worst thing anyone could do to me and that was that. Never talked to her again, never saw her again, not even by accident. 

In between 2013 and 17 I met some people, hooked up some times but rarely, cause it doesn't give me anything. Morally I'm not opposed to ONS at all, it just never did anything to me. 

2017 I met a woman through some friends and we got along very well and physically she's attractive as hell to me. And obviously I was to her. 
We, the friends, her and me, made a trip together and crashed at a friend's place. We had to share a bed and one night we started to cuddle. Nothing more. For 2 nights we cuddled and it was amazing. 
As soon as they dropped me of at my place afterwards she started texting me and we continued to do that non stop for days until she came over to my place on a wednesday. We watched a movie and cuddled some more through the night, next day (we were off work) we spent the whole day together and went to Ikea to browse and eat and had a great time. After that I thought she'd drop me off, but instead she turned the car and said ""you know what, we're going to my place, I'll feed the cat and then we go back to yours and watch some movies"". And we did. Watching movies, talking deep talks until 5 in the morning on friday when she left cause I had to work 3 hours later. We continued texting and all and cause of her hours she was always awake and went to bed before me, so it was always initiated by her, texting me good morning and good night and throughout the day even though we were both at work. 
Then, suddenly after 2 weeks she kind of ghosted me. I asked to meet and just hang out casually, she said she felt like to be alone right now, I responded sure, just write me if you're ever in the mood and she never did. 

We saw each other occasionally because of our mutual friends and that was it. About a year after that whole incident we were all out together and at some point, within context, I asked her why she did that and she told me she's got issues and knows it. So again, that was the answer I was left with. 

We still see each other nowadays and it's always fun and we clearly have some chemistry but by now I know I'm worth more than that, so I don't pine after her.

That's basically the story of my kind of disastrous love life, leaving out all the shit happening before 2013 which is plenty.

I don't really want relationship because, duh. But I'm human after all (ugh) and of course I miss being held and kissed and have someone who knows me. I have year long friends who know and love me of course, but that different knowing that comes with a relationship is lacking. But I don't want something superficial and I don't see myself being able to really trust and let myself fall again. I never want to feel the heartbreak I felt years ago, never want to be broken by anyone, cause that's literally my worst nightmare that once came true. 

I'm confident and self aware enough to not pursue a relationship just for the sake of having someone. I can't bear that. 

I wish for something real, for someone to really want me for me, not because they want love and somebody to love, but me. As a person, a character or whatever you want to call it. I'm not even saying it should last forever, a relationship dying in a natural way I can handle. But to be broken, I can't. 

So yeah, I feel pathetic for reaching out anonymously on an online platform, writing what feels like 100 paragraphs and having anxiety that no one's gonna bother and read it.

Luckily i aren't shy anymore and pretty confident, but all these year looking down has made me terrible at eye contact and it's feels like People think im rude cause i dont look them in the eyes as we speak.

July 16, 2019 5:16PM  &lt;address&gt;

Dear future self, 

You are reading this by now, and it is exactly 5:16 in the afternoon, July 16, 2024.

By now, you are already working as an RN. Your husband, xxx, was still at work as you were typing this. He worked as an entry level cook at xxxxx. By now, he should be an executive chef or somewhere along the line.

5 years ago, you were stuck at working as a PSW at xxxxxx. You could not wait to pass your exam so you can leave that place and work somewhere else better. You had to suck it up first until you will become an RN.

5 years ago, you were studying for your NCLEX RN exam, for the second time. You were anxious, unsteady, unhappy, not contended with everything that’s happening in your life. You were not doing well with your review. You were all over the place and that’s why you failed. You wasted so much money, time, and energy. You were not prepared for that life. 

5 years ago, you were renting a one-bedroom basement apartment with no in suite laundry. Sucked, but you guys were just starting with your life. You had no car. You were so irritated by the fact that you could not afford it yet because you had credit card debts and personal loan—aside from your monthly bills. 

5 years ago, you were at the point that you wanted to give up on everything, on life. You wanted to disappear from everyone, from the world. You felt like your life was useless, that it was not going anywhere. You had nothing but your husband and your family. Your best friends were all over the world. You have not seen them since you left home, 8 years ago. 

Anyway, your mother in law will be travelling to Romania tomorrow to visit her ill mother. Hope she will have a safe flight and her mother to have a healthy remaining life. 

Your family is doing well. Your brother will have his first born in 2 months. You wanted to come home to see them after 3 years, but you could not because you must pass your exam first, plus you’re broke. You had to fix your life here first to be stable before going back home. You badly wanted to go home not only to visit your family, but to see Elvis and Duke as well. 

Fast forward to today, you should already have a car or cars, you have your own house, you have already visited your family back home. You have at least an expensive bag, shoes, and whatever you wanted 5 years ago. You and your husband are doing so much better, and he should be driving by now as well. You have one kid, or two. And I mean planned children.

You are 34 years old now, and your husband is 33. Time flies so fast, right? I hope you are finally HAPPY and contented with YOURSELF and LIFE. Keep it going xxxxx. Congratulations on making it this far when you wanted to end your life 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 years ago. Stay happy, xxxxx!

Love,

You, 2019",16Jul2019,0

Then they sent me a referral to another job opening that’s similar. To be honest, I thought it was just an easy let down type of thing but applied anyways because the job seemed awesome... and today I GOT THE JOB!! I’m so happy and excited and grateful!!

122,"For literally as long as I can remember, I've had this reoccurring dream of fish tanks.

It's never just 1 fish tank. It's a warehouse sized room of hundreds of isles of 10 gallon fish tanks.

I find myself walking down the isles trying to cover my eyes because the fish inside are terrifying.

They resemble giant eels, lion fish, angler fish.. All the fucking scary ones, but I can still see them. And when I do, an unbelievable and overwhelming sense of pure FEAR and ANXIETY paralyzes me. A sensation I've never felt in my waking life.

The water is always dark, the fish are always looking at me and their mouths are stuck open.

The other night, after booking a vacation to Arizona (I used to live there, now I live in Boston and have been depressed ever since I moved back.. this might be when the fish tank dreams started happening) I had this dream again.

I was looking at a purple beta fish in crystal clear, bubbly fresh water. 

I took a step back to look at all the fish tanks and I felt this complete and utter feeling of comfort and happiness. 

All of the tanks were clean and clear. 

I woke up and could not believe it..

I'd like to know a reoccurring dream you have",16Jul2019,2
123,"Hello Reddit,

I'm only 20 years old, yet I have a strong feeling about the times that are long gone, long before I was even born.

The times when life used to be more simple, almost trouble free. Music was great, beer tasted like freedom and you could do everything that crossed your mind.

I can't help it but think that this world has its best years behind its back. You could pack your stuff and just go. Wherever your legs would take you. Or your Harley. Those were the days...

Anyway, just wanted to rant a bit, becuse I was feeling a bit down for the past couple of days and wanted to share with someone. Your opinions are very welcome and I look forward to them, Thank you for your time :)",16Jul2019,3
124,"About a month and a half ago I signed up for a membership at planet fitness and started going 3-4 times a week regularly.  Since I started going to the gym i’ve been noticing that nearly all women of average attractiveness, who i previously considered around the same level of attractiveness as myself, are always there with their 6’ tall 200lb sculpted boyfriends whom I could never compare to. 

This has really made me wonder: “if these women who I consider average are dating far above average males, what quality of woman could I get?”

I understand how superficial this may seem but let’s be honest with ourselves, baseline sexual attraction is incredibly important in relationships.",16Jul2019,1

127,"So this last senior year I ended up developing a huge crush on this girl. I always thought she was attractive since like freshman year of highschool, but I never really had any reason to be near or approach her. We ended up sharing one class senior year. 2nd day of school the teacher allowed us to pick our seats, and I ended up coming like a min late and practically all the tables(3-4 students) were filled out. There were only a couple spots available and none by any of my friends. Teacher told me I had to sit down, and my crush told me to come sit at her table with 2 of her friends. I decided to cuz why not. I'm smart, so I assumed that was possibly the reason. I'm a reasonably social person, but I'm usually shy the first week of school until I get back into the groove. We had a worksheet that required knowledge from a previous class that a lot of people in the class too, except I didn't. The teacher asked us to work on it, and since I was kinda shy at this table and didn't know how to do it, I just sat there confused trying to figure it out. My crush saw me and asked if I needed any help on it, explained it to me, and checked in on me again after I did it and asked if I understood it or not. Fast forward to later that month, one girl at the table suggested to make a groupchat for our table for that class and asked me if I wanted to be in it. I gave her my phone number. A couple days after that, my crush asked if I knew whose number was which in the groupchat and asked me for mine. Later that day, she added me on snapchat. She also requested to follow me on Instagram a couple months later after I just had made one. I snapped her that next day a random pic just to see if she would respond and she did. We kept snapping back and forth for a day until she randomly left me on open. I decided not to double snap. Two days went by without a snap and then she finally snapped me. It went back and forth again and then she left me on open late evening but this time she snapped me next morning. Pattern continued from October to December. Obviously, we got a streak and frequently snapped unless she left me on open. I usually responded to all her snaps until one week I decided just to respond once a day for the streak and then ignore her. Twice that week she blue messaged me random questions about that class that were pretty useless tbh. In class, she always used to ask me for help whenever she had a question(cuz I'm smart). We talked a decent amount then(mostly about the class). However, our teacher reorganized the seating assignments in like late October and I didn't get to sit next to her anymore. Since then, I didn't talk in person with her at all, but I kept snapping her. I drew up conversation with her a couple times by responding to her story and talking about if she was ready for a test, and she seemed really nice and had decent responses. Sometimes, I tried sparking a convo by saying a statement instead of a question, but in those instances, she usually just replied with a selfie(like all her snaps). Anyways, December to February she started to never leave me on open and started responding super quickly(sometimes in like a couple second or even minutes even if I took hours to respond). If I had to guess, I'd say she's shy except with her friends and girls. Doesn't really talk to many guys. In class when I didn't sit by her, I got a lot of attention from the teacher since I was smart and aced tests but didn't do homework. A lot of the times I got called out, everyone looked at me and a lot of times she looked at me and smiled. One time I could even hear my name in the convo I think she was saying I was super smart and then looked across the room and smiled at me(doesn't mean anything I know). Anyways, in February she went to a school dance with a dude from another school and through researching, I found out she was dating and had been doing so since early December, which surprised me because her snap frequency and response time really started becoming really good then. I became salty after finding out she was dating, and I cut the 100+ day streak we had because either way we didn't really talk in person anymore and she didn't start convos over snap. She still kept snapping me for a week after I cut the streak until I blue chatted her that I didn't want one. Two months later, I find out she broke up and a couple weeks after that I sent her a snap, and she left me on open. I didn't want to snap her again, so I just left it at that and she never responded back. 



I just want to know if there were any clear signs I should've pursued and asked her out here, or was it all ambiguous and meaningless tbh? I know I should've asked her out either way in the beginning cuz it seemed like she was really interested, but I had limitations. I was kinda addicted to seeing her hot selfies all the time on snapchat and wish I didn't cut our streak since she ended up breaking up because now I basically have no contact with her now. We are going to the same college this fall, but I feel like she hates me now but I still have a major crush on her that I am unable to get over. You think there's any way I could reach out to her when it starts?

TLDR- girl asked me to sit by her, always asked me questions in class whenever she was confused, added me on snap and Instagram, asked for my phone number, and responded to my snaps all the time and quickly. Also tested me(I think) by leaving me on open for two days after we snapped the whole day after she added me first. Smiled at me a lot of times in class and sometimes talked about how smart I was to other people. I cut our streak off(100+) after I found out she was dating and told her to stop snapping me. Snapped her a couple months later after I knew she broke up with bf and she didn't respond. Does she hate me now and did I have a chance or clear signs she liked me for getting her? Any chance or idea of how to reconnect with her in college this fall(we are going to same one)?",16Jul2019,0
128,"Am a dude, 20 yo. When I was younger I was generally fatter than I am now, elementary school me genuinely looked like a ball with limbs, and I've been gradually getting in shape since. In middle school I remember weighing 63 kg (I believe 138 lbs) which is pretty dang unhealthy for a short 13 year old. That was the point I knew something was really wrong and I stated paying attention to it.    

By the end of high school I was slimmer, still a bit on the chubby side but to the point my grandma always said I look skinny and could use some food. These past couple of months, I've started eating healthier and this newfound diet helped me lose a few extra kilograms. I'm now roughly the same weight (~67kg/145lbs) I used to be when I was 13, except now, for the first time in maybe 15 years it finally fits into the normal range on the BMI scale.    

I'm so happy to be able to reach a point where I look at my body and I'm actually pretty proud of it's shape, definitely took me long enough.

Tl;dr was a fat kid, now I'm not and I finally kinda like my body",16Jul2019,2
130,"I came to a realization this morning as I was lying in bed thinking of how much I didn't want this day. After a short burst of tears, I literally said out loud ""What is wrong with you?"". Just as rain drops individually fall to form a puddle, so did my thoughts to form my realization. Specific recent situations and experiences came to mind, which I won't share, but they generally come together as....doing things I love seem weirdly unrewarding and unexciting...time with friends and/or family is ""eh""....things I do seem to take an unreasonable amount of time to complete...my emotions/expressions are dulled...I've lost weight...my sleep is erratic...So, in opposition of what my tracked moods would indicate, I'm a bit depressed. Why? Being depressed for me is usually environmentally triggered. This case is no different, which I am attributing to two sequential, yet interactive factors 1) work and 2) separating from my partner/best friend. I know this will pass; circumstances will change and/or I will find a way to cope. I rarely openly tell people my emotions or feelings, (especially when it makes me feel vulnerable) unless they are veiled as anger or exhaustion, so disclosing my realization to someone is unlikely. I thought telling 1, 2, or even a handful of internet strangers could suffice. Thanks for letting me share.",16Jul2019,2
131,"Money has been tight for a bit. I'm home now. I have a full stomach. I get paid tomorrow and then money will be fine for the foreseeable future.

I went to food pantry recently. Maybe in a bit I'll stop back and throw them some cash and/or food. It's crazy to know. There's a place 5 minutes walk from my apartment. I stopped by, they were super chill. Gave me lots of food. Quick in and out. 

Don't feel ashamed if you go to food pantry. Don't think your situation is not bad enough. They want you to take the food. The food will go bad otherwise. 

Also I think a good barometer of how hungry you are is canned pork with juices lol. They gave me some. I tried man, I really tried. I cooked it, took a few bites. I just couldn't handle the smell. One day I will eat canned pork with juices and that day I know I'll be starving. It didn't taste too bad but the smell was horrible. 

Anyway. I'm home. Can relax this night. I have a full stomach and I'm home. I'll wake up tomorrow with a full bank account and everything will be fine.
