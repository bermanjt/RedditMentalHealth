2,"A lot of the time, when I'm trying to deal with my loneliness, some people say ""You gotta learn how to be content with yourself."" That phrase got me thinking: is it possible to be so content with yourself/self-reliant that other people lose value?

Over the last couple of months, I think I've slowly descended into that mindset. Before then, I always dreaded being alone, yearning for companionship. Then, I started to accept my loneliness. Instead of asking people to hang out, I started doing things by myself. I learned that it's possible to enjoy life without others. 

But it was only today that I noticed that I rarely go out of my way to make anyone else feel better. I haven't asked my family for anything, I stopped reaching out to my friends, I even quit my job so I could sell crafts from home. I've developed myself so much that I'm not really seeing the value of others anymore.

""Why go to the movies with friends when I can go by myself?"" 

""Why eat dinner with the family when I can buy my own food?""

""Why work somewhere when I'll probably make more money selling crafts?""

Is this a bad thing? A good thing? Is it possible for someone to be so self-reliant that they see other people as liabilities rather than potential assets?

**tl;dr** I've started making myself happier, but I'm worried that eventually, no one can make me happy other than myself.",20Feb2019,7
4,"I have a security camera outside of my house that is triggered by motion. Part of its view is capturing coincidentally my neighbor's vehicle departing and arriving. Since installing the camera, I've noticed that my neighbor departs and arrives home roughly twice every hour throughout the entire day of every week, seemingly all day and all night. It's a quiet suburban mid-to-upscale community. In our few interactions, he's neighborly but not very approachable and very rough around the edges. I'm pretty sure he has a gun, hearing him recklessly fire off a shot or two in his backyard at what sounded like target practice at either a tree, the ground, or one of the many types of harmless wildlife we have lurking in the area. He presents himself as someone not to be messed with whenever he loudly barks at any service contractors whether parking their trucks in front of his to fix telephone poles or mowing other people's lawns across the street. I'm not eavesdropping. His natural speaking voice is so incredibly loud and boisterous, like any prison caricature on TV of an incarcerated person who struts about wanting to be heard. I can easily hear his side of every conversation he has with his pool cleaner and other people who come to work on his house.

&amp;#x200B;

He comes off as a guy who worked hard to pull himself out from wherever he came from to make a better life for his wife and daughter. It doesn't appear that his wife works, as I never see her depart or arrive, but I've spoken to her bumping into her on occasion. I never see his young daughter. In hindsight, he may have said niece, but I have a vague memory that he referenced her once as his daughter. This is all important backdrop to paint the quiet community and his tough guy personality before adding that we are both African Americans. So, I didn't want to paint someone's leap that this is a ghetto of any kind, and because my tendency is to not jump to stereotypical conclusions. But I can't think of a single common job like Uber, police officer, tow-truck driver, or on-call anything that would explain his all day and night back-and-forth departures and arrivals every 30 minutes. It doesn't seem like time to do anything but drop off something nearby before returning home, and then departing 30 minutes later. I'll try to go back and map actual times from the motion-event videos, as there's always a strong chance I'm exaggerating how quickly and often he returns in memory. 

&amp;#x200B;

But it is daily, and his day and night activity triggers my cameras to the point that I'm considering disabling the cameras because it's always just him coming and going incessantly in short intervals. The only thing I could guiltily imagine is that he is some sort of modernized drug dealer that instead of selling drugs on a street corner, he does drop offs whenever receiving a phone call. But even that doesn't fully make sense to me, because why leave and return every 30 minutes? I feel like I'm missing something, and that there must be a logical obvious answer from someone who has a job that mirrors this. I'm not a nosy neighbor type. iT's just everytime I look at what triggered my cam, it's him. I'm not even compelled to contact the police if he were a drug dealer unless there was suspicion he was involved in something more nefarious that was harming people who were unknowing victims, or something quite deadly beyond marijuana. But I have zero evidence of him being a drug dealer. I just can't imagine what his job is. To afford his house, he doesn't seem to have enough time to go to work, although he does depart every day early in the morning, but then returns shortly thereafter, and that pattern then repeats throughout the day.

The problem is that now I’m flinching and ducking every time I see any bird flying towards me or making bird noises, even if it’s a harmless little pigeon or sparrow and it’s chirping prettily instead of squawking demonically. It has been very inconvenient and I am starting to fear open spaces.

18,"So, some context. I've been in online school for four years before I've started going to high school last year. For the record, I don't think there is anything wrong with crossdressing (clearly), nor do I think it's wrong to not have masculine role models, but that's exactly what happened with me (I've been living in LA). Most people I knew were women or gay, and about two years ago I made a video where I played a female character and my sister gave me clothes from her to wear.

Flash-forward to now, and as an insecure straight male I obviously wanted no one to see that, but didn't take down the video. I've become friends with this girl I think is cute, though she clearly doesn't like me, and she's an upperclassman anyway so whatever. We're both in Into the Woods together but have been talking over text more, and she saw the video and I am extremely embarrassed and especially worried about seeing her when school is back knowing she saw what I prayed no one would.

She thought it was funny and probably thought I was gay anyway before (I've kind of accepted that's my high school fate) but god that was so embarrassing.

Has anything as embarrassing as this happened to you?

Then he defended that was just my preference, she's close to 18, she gave her consent (legal age of consent in our country is 12). He even asked me if both 13 year old have sex, were they both pedophiles? I lost my cool, and my respect for him and called him an idiot and his argument is stupid. I mean that's a child!

That's my garbage, not available to any creature that sneaks in and lives under my fridge.


So, tonight I set the traps and happened to notice the mouse was chilling between the fridge and counter. I went outside and got a piece of all thread rod. I was able to make it back into the kitchen and it looked like the mouse was snacking on something. I was able to speak and kill the mouse on the first try. I was no longer a suburb dwelling dork, I channelled my ancient hunter ancestors and killed the wild beast. My wife was impressed with my masculine display of heroism, but she left me to clean up the carcass by myself.

22,"[It's a classic line in Hot Fuzz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puK5CwThaq4), but I think it's spot on.

The way I see it, there are only three possible causes for collisions:

1. Someone was driving like an asshole or idiot.  Note that I consider driving too fast for conditions or any sort of weather-related crash to be included here.

2. Sudden unexpected mechanical failure, such as a brake line suddenly failing, tire exploding, etc.

3. Things that are frequently called ""Acts of God"" in legalese, such as [a large rock falling into the road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwfKeFA9iEo).

I have no statistics to back this up, but I'd be willing to bet money that a minimum of 90% of crashes are caused by #1.  In these cases, it is flat out wrong to call the crash an ""accident"".  Driving recklessly, distracted, drunk, etc...these do not happen by accident.  They are deliberate choices that result in collisions.  By calling them ""accidents"", it implies the collision couldn't have been prevented, or that the person that caused it can't be blamed for it.

Even crashes caused by carelessness (Such as not sufficiently checking a blind spot before changing lanes) *still* are not ""accidents"".  When you're in control of a 2,000+ lb hunk of steel, there's no room for carelessness.  One failed shoulder check can cause death and dismemberment, and calling such a collision an accident feels like an attempt to minimize the responsibility and accountability.",20Feb2019,3

25,"Hey Reddit

I don’t really know what to say or who to talk to so I thought I’d pour everything here in hopes of feeling better or finding some guidance. Me and my fiancé broke up after 8 years very recently, it’s my first breakup and it her decision in the end. The reason was that she felt that the relationship was stagnating and that she wanted to explore life and find herself. We started dating when we were around 17 and I’m 25 now, it just saddens me so fucking much because I know that one of the reasons was because of me, I wasn’t romantic enough at times and I’m aware of this because I’m not the most romantic guy, that and for at least two years now my mental state has been depressed for a variety of reasons that I won’t go into right now. She admitted she carried me a lot during that time and I won’t even try to deny that, her words were “How can I love someone who doesn’t love themselves?” and that stings me so much. I can’t help but beat myself up over the past week since the breakup because if only I tried harder, these 8 years wouldn’t have been trashed like this. 

We accepted that we’d stay friends and we still talk, it’s hard sometimes but it works. What I don’t understand right now is that she still says she cares for me a lot and even loves me, she still hugs me and at times has kissed me after the breakup. I had to level with her and tell her that I couldn’t do that, it hurts too much because it just fools my brain into thinking that we’re still together when we’re not. I get that it’s hard to drop feelings for someone even after a breakup but I don’t understand the affection after a breakup. I don’t know if that’s the right thing to do or not but I felt that it was for the best. 

I still want to fight for this relationship, I don’t know if I should or shouldn’t, whether it’ll hurt me more in the end or do me more good. I definitely think it’s salvageable, but nothing in life is certain. Maybe I should let go, maybe not.

I’m almost 26 and I feel like a child all of a sudden, I feel like the answers are right in front of me but I’m too naive and can’t see them. I don’t know, everything is a bit of a blur right now and I just thought writing this down and getting some advice would do me some good, for what it’s worth. Anyway. I definitely need to work on myself, I guess if there’s any silver lining it’s that the relationship made it harder to realise just how bad things have become. At least I’ve come to awareness, as much as it hurts.",20Feb2019,3

30,"Neckbeardiness is just being relatively deprived of social contact (intentionally or by circumstance) consistently and from a young age, and then getting the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://thedecisionlab.com/bias/dunning-kruger-effect/) on social savviness, and becoming stuck on the peak. Social savviness is a broad subject - appropriate language and timing, body language, empathy, humour, reading a room, the tasteful breaking of these rules for comedic or communicative effect, etc. And he believes, perhaps by virtue of his upbringing or natural talent or intellect or some other semi-credible source that he's a master of all those things. This is the Dunning-Kruger in full swing, and this particular application a doozy.

&amp;#x200B;

From that elevated position of confidence - baseless confidence but effective confidence nonetheless - he believes that everyone else, the poor normies who get all wound up over 'nothing', are all socially inept compared to him. Somehow, despite them spending more time around people than him, they haven't got the natural talent with social behaviour and language that he has. Those who find him grating or irritating, he believes, simply do not understand him, for his natural ability has catapulted him beyond their comprehension. He might even feel sorry for them.

&amp;#x200B;

But it's lonely at the top.

&amp;#x200B;

He knows something is wrong, he's not stupid. (all that time not socialising went into other interests and studies, they're not morons) True masters of conversation and social situations have friends, are fun and parties and generally liked, but somehow that doesn't happen to him. He sees the awkward reactions to his statements, notices the barely-concealed cringes at his jokes, hears the hushed chatter when he leaves the room. He's in constant arguments both online and in real life. He wears eccentric clothing and develops his vocabulary because, for some baffling reason, nobody seems to recognise his social brilliance on its own merit.

&amp;#x200B;

But he sees the flaws in everyone else too. Sees how they anguish in fear at what people will say to them and about how what they say will be interpreted, in addition to all their other flaws that humans have. It looks like hell. No thanks. At the very least, he says, he's not like them.

&amp;#x200B;

The lack of empathy may be the worst part of the whole situation. How could he make sense of the feminist movement? The black lives matter movement? Anything whatsoever that requires putting himself in the shoes of someone who has a life completely different to him? 

&amp;#x200B;

How could he understand the concept of creepiness when he has never felt (and is unable to empathise with people who have felt) unwanted sexual attention? Creepiness, he surmises, must not actually exist, and therefore when called a creep, further surmises that it must be just another thing to add to his mounting pile of ""weird things women do for no reason"".

&amp;#x200B;

He believes he has empathy, he has empathised with his friends who are mostly similarly gendered, coloured, and sexually preferenced. He has empathised with the fictional characters from film, TV and games who are specifically designed to appeal to people like him. But he does not. He is self-contained. He is resistant to change. He is an intelligent, confident force immune to social pressure, but he is lonely, bitter and arrogant. And he is afraid, because if somehow he is changed, he will lose his confident force, he will become susceptible to social pressure, and he may discover that he is not intelligent as he thinks. All that defines him will be gone. What will be left? It's not worth finding out.

&amp;#x200B;

\--

  
This is a message to anyone who read that and felt it in their soul. If what I said hit you like a tonne of bricks or, more likely, you just read that and said to yourself something along the lines of ""yeah that's me, except that I DO have empathy and creepiness IS just some weird thing women do for some reason"", or if you use a word like normie or NPC or chad or ""your opinion is invalid"" anything along those lines unironically in your speech, this is for you:

&amp;#x200B;

The first step to recovery is admitting you have a problem. Intelligence often exists alongside ignorance, and changing your ignorance will not make you stupid or weak. Your neckbeardiness is not your personality, your neckbeardiness is an a virus inside your personality, and curing it will not damage you, it will heal you.   


Have a chat with someone, but don't offer any opinions or help. Just listen, imagine what it feels like to be in the situation they describe, and describe to them how you imagine that feels. Make sure you don't invalidate their opinions or steamroll them with your own, just add your thoughts alongside. From this day forward, you must keep in mind that your belief that your opinions and tastes are superior is a reflex which is tied to your self-esteem. When you notice it happening, when you feel yourself about to get self-righteous and tell these empty-headed normies how it is, stop yourself. You don't have to agree, but you don't get to edit them or change them. It won't work anyway.

At your next few parties or gatherings that include women, have a conversation with a woman but speak to her as if you were speaking to a man, except try not making any references to sex whatsoever. You might think you can pull it off, you might think it makes you funny or charming, you might justify it with ""If she gets weirded out it's her loss and she's a prude anyway"", but don't, because you can't. Don't offer to hug her, your sneaky hugs aren't sneaky, they know what you're doing, all of them. Just chat to her, and when you're done, talk to someone else. That's all there is to it.  


Throwing in a ""That's what she said"" or pointing out every double-entendre someone says (""i'm coming"", ""hold this for me"", other things that people just say in regular conversation) might have brought the house down in high school but it grinds conversations to a halt and gives the impression that you're intentionally destroying the flow of conversation so you can make it all about yourself. They can be pulled off, but not by you, not yet. You'll know you can do these things because, after being freed from the Dunning-Kruger peak, you'll feel like you can't pull them off, and then eventually you will feel like you can again. That's when you can. 

&amp;#x200B;

That applies to everything else too. 

You are overdue for a crash in confidence and self esteem, the crash most people have in high school, and you probably deserve it. Not just a bad day, a world shattering life event you'll remember forever. It's ok, it's a part of growing up. 

You'll feel like you can't do any social stuff like you used to. but then you'll feel like you can, and for the first time(ish) in your life, you'll be right.

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's the good news.

You're smart. You've been critically analysing the faults in society for your whole life, you saw the patterns and stepped outside them on purpose, you are not a mindless cog, and this change won't change that. Your growth after the crash will be much faster because you are older and intelligent. a whole new layer of the world will open up to you. It'll be ok. It's better to know.

&amp;#x200B;

It took a heartbreak, a staggering amount of guilt and an escape from the social environment I had created to push me past that point, to free me from from the Dunning-Kruger peak, To make me recognise that i'm not bloody Voltaire, to reveal to me the context that I create around me, to topple me from Mount Stupid and down the valley of the unknown and finally up the balmy hill of social competence. I haven't been called a creep in years and people flock to my parties and invite me to things. I feel loved and respected, and I know its true because i know what it feels like when i'm just telling myself that.

36,"tl;dr I'm about to leave university, so I've been wondering, where do people who hate large social situations like groups/clubs/parties find partners?

I've been reading through older posts on reddit in general and I felt like none of the suggestions really applied to me. Of the suggestions that I've come across that I've tried:

Online - This one has actually been really successful for me, either through dating apps, games, or just posting and people added me, I've met literally every single one of my friends and all but one of my past partners online, even the ones who lived close to me. I'm not too keen relying on the internet though because as a male, the odds are so overwhelmingly stacked against me, and I've been in some pretty toxic relationships in the past, so I've been recommend to look elsewhere.

Through friends - My main group of friends are really shut-in too or don't live anywhere near me so we kind of just live our own lives. The ones that are close to me IRL are really antisocial too and don't talk to women, even my friends who are women don't talk to other women.

Interest Clubs - I play games and watch anime for example, but not everyone who plays games or watch anime will have anything in common because their tastes can be too niche. The biggest source of new friends IRL I meet people at is when I go to Yugioh tournaments weekly, but anyone who's ever played that game IRL will know that effectively 0 women play the game.  
A secondary issue is that I hate the cliques that develop in these clubs/groups, and the social drama that arises because of them. IDK how to describe it, but I find any sort of gossip, talking behind people's backs, and group power dynamics to be unbearably annoying so I overwhelmingly prefer talking to people 1 on 1.  

Parties/Clubs/Bars - I don't drink or do drugs, and I hate these loud, crowded places. I also find it really annoying to talk to someone I met recently if they're drunk, because the way they are makes it really difficult to get to know them properly, beyond their attitude when drunk. 

School - I'm in a major where my classes don't have women in them. I'm also unsure of how appropriate it is to just talk with random people I know nothing about, especially since I know a lot of them have places to be since they're at school or studying.

Church - I'm not religious and a similar problem with school, I'm unsure of when it's appropriate to speak to someone there.

In General - People who I've dated or made friends with that I met IRL tended to be too normal to be compatible with me. I know that I have absurdly restrictive limitations on my social interactions and I have fairly niche interests too, so meeting people IRL is exceptionally hard because I feel like they wouldn't have enough in common with me to be compatible, in neither personality nor interests.

37,"Hi, all. Where do I even begin. I am a senior in college and I have been dealing with depression for years now. It has really worsened in these past few months, given some external factors, and I think I am falling apart. My Nana passed away in January. My step brother just got diagnosed with stage 4 non hodgkins. And, I just received my rejection letter from the graduate school I applied to. I had spent months working on my app, I had a high GPA, and I busted my ass off. I’m devastated. 

I’m anxious about graduating and starting a life of my own. I feel like my grandparents on my mother’s side will push for me to move back home, when I have no more friends there. I am a first gen college student and the thought of falling back into that small town I have tried to escape my entire life is excruciating. I have always wanted out because I have never belonged.

Change is the one thing that everyone of us would go through – we grow old, mentally we get mature, we fall in love, get our hearts broken,fall sick etc. We all experience change, some happy and some negative.

And I know it was meant to be helpful, but the way it was worded ""just ask the guest it's not hard"" made me pretty annoyed. Then the day just got progressively worse, just lots of little mistakes, the duty manager was getting annoyed and on my break I just broke down.

73,"** How we got here : **

Before getting into how I believe TES:L can be saved, I'd like to suggest a hypothetical way of how TES:L arrived at its current state. Imagine the most boring strategy card game possible. There are only creatures and each creature has power and health equal to its magicka. So a 1 magicka creature is 1/1, a 2 magicka creature is 2/2, etc...

The game itself is kind of boring. You hope to draw creatures on curve, attack other creatures when you can trade beneficially, and generally play optimally. However, you never really feel cheated when you lose because, well, how could you? There's perfect symmetry.

But in order to keep players interested, new cards need to be released. *By* *definition* these new cards must be more powerful than previous cards. Otherwise they would never be played. So now there's a 4/4 creature that costs 3. Maybe a 3/7 that costs 4. 

But eventually the players grow tired of those and we have to add *effects* and *powers*. This is where the opportunity (but necessity) for a major problem begins, because of *synergy*. Because as more new effects are introduced, the possibility for synergy grows exponentially with the number of cards in the system. Similar to a [network effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law).

Soon, the system begins to change in ways the creators never intended. The possibility for synergies spiral out of control, similar to the way [Alchemy](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Alchemy) functioned in Skyrim. All systems move towards [entropy](https://www.realclearscience.com/lists/10_greatest_ideas_in_the_history_of_science/entropy_universe_tends_toward_disorder.html).

All of a sudden, the player base senses something is off. The game is still *challenging*, because you're playing against other human decision makers. But, it's somehow less *fun*. Certain card interactions feel fair while others feel exploitative. Often players are unaware of why they feel this way, but they get the sense that something just isn't right.

**Where we are now :**

For a longer version, see the post by u/DukeMo [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollslegends/comments/asejvz/i_love_tesl_heres_why_im_leaving/), but the key points that relate to this post are:

* Too many possible synergies and good cards make tricolor decks the only viable option, along with one dual color (warrior). Spellsword, Monk, Archer, Scout, and Mage are all dead classes.

* Too many cards exist that aren't fun to play against. Synergies have grown out of control, Ramp Warrior being a good example.

* Creature trading, control of board, midrange decks are no longer relevant.

We've seen the results of these in the game. Players are less engaged. Wait times for games are longer. Within the top posts on reddit, not one is within the last three months. And I don't have real data on the subject, but I feel as though more players quit games sooner, rather than play them out.

To be fair, I thought the Isle of Madness story mode was outstanding. It had about as much emotion and great storytelling as could possibly be done in a card game. It was fantastic! But the cards released and new mechanics did not help the PvP scene. 

Fortunately, I think it is possible to simultaneously salvage the competitive, expanded PvP scene as well as encourage veteran players to stay engaged.

** The path forward :**

I suggest the following three changes to The Elder Scrolls: Legends going forward.

* **Replace 'Casual' with 'Classic' as a game mode:**

Classic mode would include only the expansions, stories, and promotional sets up to and including Clockwork City. Specifically: Madhouse, Heroes of Skyrim, Dark Brotherhood, and Clockwork City, along with Monthly cards up to that point.

It would provide a fun environment for veteran players that preferred the older style of play, as well as a simpler version of the game for newer players. There would less effects (no rally, exalt, betray, or plot), and no double cards. 

There would be substantially less synergy as well. This would provide a more welcoming environment for new players and they would not be overwhelmed with the abundance of cards to choose from in deck building.

**Expand character leveling and racial bonuses:**

I'm honestly very surprised this hasn't been done so far, because I think every player remembers how exciting the early days of leveling up were. With each expansion to The Elder Scrolls Online, the max level cap for Champion Points has been increased. It now stands at 810 (I believe it was originally 270). 

To start, I would suggest a new cap of level 250, with appropriate rewards spacing such as an epic card every 10 levels, a legendary card every 25, and an alternate art legendary every 50. These could be race specific to your avatar. Small amounts of soul gems and gold would fill the remaining levels.  

In addition, I would suggest a small number of new avatar portraits for attaining level 250. There would be no need to record new voice lines or dialogue. 

**Inclusions for next expansion:**

Lastly, I would suggest two inclusions for the next expansion or story. A new keyword: *Stoneskin* and a new card restriction *Noble*.

*Stoneskin* would be a simple keyword for a few creatures. They would be immune to lethal. I think most of you have seen this effect in The Black Dragon. I think it provides an important counter to Telvanni and Ramp Warrior decks as well as strengthening mid-range. It could be limited to a handful of Yellow, and Purple or Blue cards initially to strengthen Mage and Spellsword decks.

Secondly, *Noble* would be a card keyword that essentially means: ""Can only be played in dual color decks."" I think a good, simple start would be to introduce 10 dual-color cards in the next expansion. One for each of the ten dual classes. These would be lore based and vary in strength related to the current meta. Crusader and Warrior would not need a significantly strong card, but Mage and Spellsword would. 

-

With the transition to a Classic mode, an addition of more leveling, and *possibly* a change in the next expansion, I believe we would see both a substantial reinvestment from the current player base and the opportunity to attract newer players as well in a simpler environment. ",20Feb2019,1
74,"The first time I realised I was unattractive was when I was around 12 years old. Our school was throwing a dance party and when it came to choosing a girl to dance with, every single one of them rejected me saying ""Eww"" or ""I don't want to dance with someone like you"". I still remember how crushed I was. My parents told me that I was a cheerful kid, following his passion from a very young age. I was attending drawing classes and wanted to grow up making 3D animations. But when the dance party night happened, I became sad and introverted and didnt do much asides from playing video games. I thought things would get better, but they didn't. All the way up to college, my life sucked... It wasn't terrible, it was just lonely and sad. I never had a girlfriend, so I missed out on having an intimate relationship with someone. I don't want to brag, but I was smart enough to get a job that was payed nicely, despite having no passion or hobbies whatsoever. When I saved enough money, I decided to undergo plastic surgery, specially nose job and chin implants and dark circle eye removal. Plus I hired a personal trainer and got into shape. So in a span of a year, i went from being an 4/10 to a solid 8/10 (i think).  Up until now, I didnt know how shallow people and society are. I mean, everyone started treating me better, i made friends way more easier and women... Everyone tells you that its all about confidence but I think its complete bull\*\*\*. I am the same person I was before, only better looking and dating women was never as easy. This change made me realise how important looks are for being happy and confident. I think its the key for happines. There is a lot of talk about white privilige these days. The only true privillige that exists is good looking people privillige.

&amp;#x200B;

So to my fellow ugly friends I say this. Dont try to get people to like you, they probably won´t. People are sh\*tty and shallow. Work on yourself and if you are willing to undergo the change of plastic surgery, go for it.

I took a job in June as an office manager almost out of desperation because I felt I couldn’t be unemployed, though I was receiving severance, and I was too depressed to motivate myself to apply for something I was more qualified for. 
In my current position, I am alone in the office a majority of the time because my boss is a sales rep. He made it seem like he would mold me into being a sales rep too but this job has become much more of an administrative position than I originally thought. At this point, I’m actively applying to new jobs and even have an interview Friday (yay!) so I’m not looking to tell my boss how my happiness can be improved in the current position. 
I just feel so incredibly lonely. I hated my job that I was laid off from but didn’t realize how important it was for me to be surrounded by a community. Even if many of those coworkers annoyed me. When my boss is in the office, I hate it because he is such a distraction. He tries to be my buddy and tells me the MOST personal stories about his life. He asks me questions about processes that he should definitely already know and acts like he knows everything yet can’t do a basic function in excel. When he’s out of the office, the most socializing I have is giving the ups man a signature or chatting with the janitor. I have no peers and it is making me so depressed. 
I live with my boyfriend but when he gets home from work, he is wiped out from his day as he owns a landscaping company.

She had a lot of bad habits and, I felt like she was showing signs of emotional manipulation.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been a little over a week now since we've stopped talking. I miss her so much, and I can't for the life of me figure out why. I know she wasn't respectful of my feelings, pretty much played victim the entire time we were together; made me feel bad for feeling uncomfortable with the way she chooses to handle her emotional problems. All of my friends have said I am better off without her (they all saw her for who she was the minute they met her). Despite all of the bad she did, I still miss her. I can't figure out whether it's a sign that what I felt for her was genuine, or that I'm able to give myself fully to someone. Maybe it's just being around someone who made me feel like I was wanted (despite it being an illusion). I'm having a hard time trying to forget about her; when my mind is idle, it goes to the memories of our time together, and then I end up missing her.

We need $300 for the internet and cable bill which is behind. 

He can't get disability, he doesn't have Medicaid so he can't go to any doctor's to get check ups, therapy or figure out anything else that was discovered when he had his stroke.

I want to just give up. Lay down and die. Despite all I'm doing to get him back on top, I can't. I don't mind working. I have asked for help and no one came to the call. I've never wanted a handout in my life. I just don't know what else I can do. It's a losing battle and I don't see any way out. 

To all the people he helped in his life, the people that he paid for your bills, he paid for your insurance, he made sure you had food, I hope someday you have a better life. I just don't understand how everyone can just turn their backs on people that have been there always. Now we are down and I can't get us out. I'm trying. I put everything I make  into the bills. 

I barely have gas, we barely have food, yet there's no help to be found.

97,"My life had its ups und downs. Right now, more downs than anything.

&amp;#x200B;

It all started about 3 years ago. I don't know what happened but I felt like something broke inside of me. I am really shy and I am not able to talk to a girl normally and since then I never had a girlfriend or any sexual contact with one. I am 19 years of age.

&amp;#x200B;

The only person I am able to speak to is a childhood friend that I've known for 8 years. I always was able to speak to him and always told him what I had on my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

But to be fair, that really didn't help. It only helped a bit. He hold me I should seek professional help from a therapist but I was never able to so, because of my parents.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents, really scrict, believe in religion, have always prioritized religion first with me coming in second. I cannot seek professional help and can't really talk to parents because my relationship with them is fragmented and I either always play on the computer for 4h+ straight or go outside with my friends. Right now I am not ready to tell them that I don't believe in god. It's like, they're not my parents and I am not their son.

&amp;#x200B;

Even if went to therapy I would be concerned from a financial aspect. Right now I am in a hole, where I cannot think emotionally and financially properly. I never took the time to save up my money and wasted it on unnecessary stuff. Whenever I got angry from either playing a game or fighting with my parents I always destroyed something I have had bought for so much.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I was out with friends I always tried to drown my sorrow with cigarettes, hookahs and alcohol. As you can guess that really didn't help me out too well.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. Suicide? Well that certainly was a topic that I was thinking about and I am actively thinking about it still. But in honest opinion, that doesn't solve my problem.

101,"So when I was a kid, my parents would tell me I couldn't leave the table until I ate everything I'd served for myself. I'd end up sitting there, not allowed to leave until I'd eaten myself sick. To this day, I don't feel full until I've just about overeaten to the point of overcapacity. 

I worry about it because I know that my metabolism isn't always going to keep up with me. I've managed to stay trim because I eat well or engage in fasting for days punctuated by huge meals. I've worked at decreasing my food intake, and controlling my appetite, but it's so difficult because I have sort of an inlaid idea about how much food to eat that isn't healthy. 

It's just disturbing to me when I've just eaten, and the skin on my stomach is almost painfully swollen and tight and hangs off of me like a pregnant belly or gut.

102,"Hi, I'm a 17 years old boy and I hope today I'll successfully make a bad impression of myself here by creeping you out.

I've recently seen some changes (bad changes) in me and it is making me go crazy. I'm very shy. I've been suffering from depression since I was 13. I don't go outside if I don't need to and stay inside most of the time and read books, play games, do graphic design etc. People think I'm a nice guy (in real meaning, not r/niceguy) because I don't treat anyone bad (I mean you can't treat anyone bad if you don't interact right?). I don't have any real life friend (have some on social media but they live overseas).

I was somewhat satisfied with my boring life until I started to see some bad things in me. I'm getting too jealous these days. It's infuriating! And it's also very embarrassing to think or talk about.

If I see a man (any age I don't care) with a woman (they maybe friends or couple, attractive or unattractive I don't care) I feel my blood is boiling in jealousy! Even if a girl just talks to someone, it triggers my bone! Now you can definitely imagine by now that I've never had a girl friend or any kind of proper female interaction in my life. It's not even like I'm desperate for girl friend (to be honest I don't even want any. I'm happy being lonely), but still it makes me so jealous to see any man with a woman.

I feel like that man is lucky and he doesn't deserve what he has and I'm better than him. Even though every cell of my body knows how false that statement is. I'm not handsome, neither I have any good hobbies nor am I rich and just forget about the personality! So there are no valid reason for me to get a girl friend.

How do I act after that? I feel an intense urge to scream! Scream as loud as I can. I also start ignoring them (once I didn't help a guy in my class in his project just because he had a girl friend). Then I realize how terrible of a person I'm becoming and I fall into depression. It has gone to a point where I get jealous of celebrities/athletes about having a girl friend.

My brain understands everything but it always fails to explain my heart about this. I can't even talk about it with my therapist because she is a married woman and it might creep her out.

I feel like I'm slowly becoming another person. I'm more angry than I've ever been in my life. I've blocked all the guys in my school on social medias just to avoid their pics with their female friends.

Is there any solution to this?

103,"My mom just got a call from a relative saying that my little cousin tried to kill herself by ingesting a bunch of pills. Apparently, she’s been suffering from depression and had also been cutting herself recently. This was likely the result of a divorce. What threw her over the edge was that her boyfriend of late broke it off with her. I just don’t know what to do with this and if there’s anything I should do. 

I’m 22 and I’ve known her since she was born, we were always very close and still keep in contact regularly. Sometimes, I’d take her and her younger brothers to McDonald’s and see how they are doing in school and staying out of trouble. I especially like to know how they are doing because we live in a small town where people generally obsess over alcohol, drugs and vandalism. I left the town behind for college and want to help them do the same one day, as most people in the town don’t graduate high school. It’s surprising how ambitious these kids are as they are already talking about what they want to be when they grow up and what university they want to attend (the same one I’m going to). 

Anyways, I just don’t know what to do because to me she’s still my innocent little cousin and thinking about her attempting suicide just kills me. Is there any way I can support her through this depression? Or should I stay out of it? I don’t want to be nosy or pushy to her but at the same rate I’d like her to know that I’m always there for her and her brothers. Especially because their parents are not always able to give them this attention.

108," I really need help on this one people. Backstory: 35yo in a rocky relationship for 5+ years, have 2 toddlers. I'm an easy-going person, friendly, thankful, and driven by a desire for harmony. A modern hippie, all about universal love and peace and acceptance. I still tend to argue if I don't understand or feel misunderstood, but what I want in the end is truth and understanding, even if it means I was wrong. My spouse has declared us incompatible though, and I'm inclined to agree.

TL/DR: I'm in a toxic relationship, and I need to escape before a mysterious death finds me. I have no solid evidence against my spouse, but I am convinced they will have me hunted down and killed if I just take the kids and run. They have the means.

I'll let you in on the secret relationship between my spouse and I. Secret. Yes, because my spouse would never show this side of their personality to anyone outside the immediate family. They slip up on rare occasions, like by demeaning me in front of my friends, but it's so rare I even get to see my friends ever since we got together. There doesn't even seem to be much time or care for our extended families either. Came to realize yesterday that I haven't really met or heard from any of their friends, and I'm starting to understand why. I feel isolated from friends and family, and feel I have no one to turn to. There's too much to explain in conversation, but I need to vent before it kills me, so I'll pour it out here.

Most notably, they frequently put me down as not being good enough. They mock my personality (""playfully"" in their eyes), beyond the point that it causes me to feel ashamed and worthless when I'm around them. Even when I have reason to be proud of my work, it is often dismissed or belittled by my spouse. It's as though I can't do anything right.

They often have a mean or offensively sarcastic sense of humor, and they get angry with me for not finding it funny. The problem is, they are so very often serious when they insult me just as frequently, so I can't tell when they are ""joking"" or not. They regularly threaten physical violence ""jokingly"", less jokingly when they are stressed, and at one time of extreme stress, though I was very calm and taking care of the baby, they did hit me several times in quick succession until I snapped and hit back once. Nobody was bruised, but they very quickly and conveniently forgot they hit me at all. Just like another time when they forgot how they bellowed so loud that they were going to beat the crap out of me, loud enough that all the neighbors in the building and anybody outside could have heard it. Why? Because I gave our son a single firm spank on his bottom per my spouse's instruction. I didn't even want to do it, but I've learned that my wants have little sway in this relationship.

I have catered to the wants and needs of my partner as best I can. However, the more I try to work to their benefit then the more I err, it seems, until somehow everything that goes wrong must be my fault, even if there is no perceivable correlation, even if the circumstances of failure were arranged by my spouse alone, only I am to blame. Actually, my partner blames and insults the kids, too, but I have been elected the scapegoat of the house.

I thought it cute at first, the frequent monitoring of my location and web activity, it means they care about my well-being right? Knowing where I am just in case we can meet up and hang out, or seeing what mutual interests I've been reading up on to enrich conversation, or checking in with me asking what I'm doing...it's all because they really care about my well-being, I genuinely thought this at first. That's how naive I am; this is how I justify the actions of others, by asking myself why would I do it? And that is what I came up with.

It gets disconcerting though, as the snooping intensifies when they are upset with me. Then every call log is reviewed, every movement becomes monitored, and a sour, uncouth, or offensive dialogue awaits me if I do not immediately respond to my spouse's messages. I get fiercely interrogated if even one of the several tracking systems on me shows me being anywhere other than work or home, which only occurs due to a legitimate gps or cellular glitch, mind you. I haven't cheated on anyone before, and haven't had the inclination to despite ample opportunities over the years. But my spouse has cheated on others and admittedly enjoyed it, and they have been cheated on as well (I think we all have), so perhaps they are responding to a fear of their own past as it is projected against me.

When I open up to share my feelings or concerns, civilly and with respect, it's 50/50 chance of neutral vs mad response. If my words aren't directly congruous with their own thoughts or opinions on a subject of conversation, then it feels like what I have to say isn't heard, considered, and especially not respected. Instead of acknowledging my feelings and sharing their own in kind, it often becomes a battle against me until they get the last word, or in rare cases until I actually succeed in clarifying my point in a way they can understand.

When I make a mistake, they don't care to know why it happened. They just want me to feel like crap, and will spin elaborate insults to secure this as though it were their favorite activity. It may actually be so. From my perspective, I make mistakes all the time, and it isn't a bad thing to do as long as a lesson is learned from them. My spouse only appreciates this perspective when they make mistakes, that is, on the rare occasion they own up to one.

*There are very few good moments with this person* – Every day brings another challenge. It seems as though they are always complaining about something, especially me and my family. My spouse attempts to control my behavior and happiness, as though the rule were if they were not happy then I should not be either, and they are rarely ever even content, let alone happy. I don't know if they have ever been happy in their whole life, actually, and if you knew their story, maybe you wouldn't blame them for this being so. I certainly don't, having heard it myself. Doesn't mean I should conform to the same bogus groove, though. A meaningful life is not found in the pursuit of happiness, rather in the appreciation for what we have. This concept seems out of reach for my spouse most of the time, though, and I just don't have what it takes to appreciate being treated like garbage.

My partner tells me I am a burden to them, financially, emotionally, and physically. They resent me for not giving them my whole paycheck and put me down for making less than them, even while I actually earned more. Doesn't matter to me who makes more, they're more than welcome to; it all goes toward our family, but my spouse sees it differently. The amount that I don't put into their checking account, about 10%, goes strictly toward medical and credit card bills, 80% of which are mutually accumulated between us both, yet the debt is in my name. Honestly, though, I would take all our debts combined under my name if it meant I could stay safely away from my partner. Emotionally, we're not on the same page: different social priorities, incompatible core beliefs and values, different means of coping, different triggers for stress, etc., we just can't relate. Physically, I don't clean up as much due to being away for work or present for children most of the time. My spouse brags about how they clean and cook and play with the kids every day while working from home to boot, and I am told that I should be equally capable. They complain about having to do everything themselves, and I won't deny their efforts. But what can I do around the house when I'm away? And what is more worthy of attention in a house than children, especially when I'm already away most of their waking hours? I help where I can, but my priorities aren't the same as my partners. Besides, most of what I do to help is only found to make things worse according to them. I like to think the kids would disagree.

I also have a daughter from a prior relationship who lives with her other parent, now far away, and any reference to her in a conversation has been a vector of discord in the past. I abandoned my spouse because of this before but became convinced they had changed within a matter of days, by the sound of their silver tongue. These days it's a little safer to talk about my daughter unless it's regarding providing additional support. Why should any letter I write to my daughter require prior approval by my spouse? Why shouldn't I send gifts or care packages to her? Why should I be required to involve my spouse in a parent-child relationship when they said they never want to see the child again and that my daughter has no place in their life? I don't want to be an estranged parent, I love my daughter and miss her so much. They demand consistency from me but provide none themselves. Communication is the breath of every relationship, but I feel continuously strangled by my SO.

I don’t feel free, welcomed, or even safe to speak my mind. I'm near to mastering the art of walking on eggshells at home. I have to act a certain way just to be accepted by my spouse. I'm not myself when I am with them, and I don't like who I've become since we got together. I have since adopted the same rude and cruel mannerisms blasted against me, and have since used them against others. Genuine friends of mine who witnessed it respectfully pointed out my uncharacteristic behavior. Because of their controlling behavior and, granted, near constant presence, our toddlers recognize that my spouse is the boss, and I am the punching bag. And my spouse either doesn't realize or doesn't care to remember that how we treat each other is the lesson we teach our kids to treat us and others and even their own selves. So the lesson these kids see every day is that it's okay to treat people like crap, you don't have to listen to anybody except the boss, and whoever can scream louder always wins.

Whenever I share my desire to grow and improve, the other person responds with mockery, disbelief, or outright forbidding of any action that might interfere with their personal preference for schedule or worldview. There is almost no encouragement or support for my efforts. Instead, they're stuck in old judgments insisting that I will never be any different than I was or am now, never good enough. I am told both that I need to change and that I can't. Regardless of my education and accomplishments, I am perceived to be an idiot with only the most foolish ideas. It seems that any subject which I ask their input on is one they didn't already think up, so they must disapprove. But asking for input in my book means sharing thoughts and ideas, and is completely different from asking permission; it isn't even phrased as a yes or no question.

My partner is continually frustrated by the fact that I am easily distracted and very forgetful, and they have convinced themselves that they must have a near perfect memory, attention, and intelligence. I hope that dream comes true for them. Were it not for my ease of forgetting, we would not have been together this long. Instead, anytime we have a good day together, I throw the past offenses out of mind entirely, it just happens. I convince myself that things aren't so bad, my partner doesn't mean to hurt me, they're just under a lot of stress, and everybody snaps at some point. For example, yesterday my partner decided that they would rather literally bang their head against the wall while shouting at themselves in front of our kids, instead of answer a question I designed to confirm our mutual plan for the evening. Unsurprisingly, there ended up being a lot of confusion about that plan in the end.

And that's when I unplugged instead of snapped. I decided if my attempts at maintaining a relationship are bringing someone to inflict self-harm, in front of ever-attentive children no less, then I need to stop. I finally accepted the possibility that I may forever lack the level of skill and understanding necessary to communicate with this particular individual as though I were their equal counterpart. And so, given the toxic nature of the relationship, I figure it'll eventually kill me to stay so I'd rather leave or die trying. I won't abandon my kids though, they are already targets of verbal abuse, and I fear their situation will only worsen if I'm not there for them.

Why did I stay with this person for so long? Because I love them, deeply, I feel sympathy for their troubles, and I have repeatedly invested so much hope and faith into their psychological growth and return to a loving manner. Such wishful thinking is easy because they are drop dead gorgeous to me and absolutely incredible in bed, albeit a rare experience now since we have kids, two jobs, and no support circle. Mostly, though, because we have the two kids that I can't raise on my own and they shouldn't be left in the maligned care of my spouse's antics either. I truly will not survive if I stay in this relationship, though. Either I'll learn to feel so bad about myself that I lose all personality and get ditched anyway, or my spouse may actually kill me with a knife in a moment of blind rage, like if they ever found this article. I feel like there have been some close calls on both these accounts already. After 5 years together, I am convinced those are the only two outcomes unless the relationship is pre-emptively ended.

So I need some input to brainstorm some options here. Your turn.

TL/DR: I'm in a toxic relationship, and I need to escape before a mysterious death finds me. I have no solid evidence against my spouse, but I am convinced they will have me hunted down and killed if I just take the kids and run. They have the means.",20Feb2019,4

I want to cry.
She is so beautiful,
I want to die.

I say I would not touch,

can i be sure ?

Oh, what if I harmed her ?

What if she fucking dies ?

I’ll never be certain,

Everything is my fault.

Everyone must hate me.

so very vile.

112,"I'm sorry, I know we're both feeling a lot of things right now.  I don't want you to leave.  I'm as confused as you are, I know the stuff we've been doing so far tonight probably hasn't been helping.

Just stay here tonight, and we can just sleep and talk about it in the morning.  Whatever you do, please don't drive home right now.  You may not think you're drunk, but you still shouldn't drive.  Here, take this blanket.  You can have this part of the couch, I'll sleep in the chair.  I hope you sleep okay.  We can grab some breakfast in the morning and if you want, we can pretend none of this ever happened.

Just please don't leave while things are so tense and weird.  The last thing I want is for this to drive a wedge between us.

That's the last thing I want.

It's the last thing I wanted.

What could I have said to make you stay?",20Feb2019,0

114,"It's kind of weird but I tend to get dragged into a rabbit hole quite quickly. It does not happen often but it happens, from time to time. I'll read about someone who died, find out they had a blog somewhere and go there to read their entries. Mostly this is for people who had some sort of illness or a depression they struggled with and wrote updates on for a small audience. I will read their little life updates. Their daily struggles. The little moments of humor and enjoyment in between all the battles of life. With each passing update I see them lose battles, win a few but always lose more until eventually the updates stop and I know they've lost the war. 

Somehow it fascinates me. The final words of someone. The final thoughts sent into the world. Someone's decline. And the finality of those words left behind, those comments frozen in time, and sometimes the author's final responses to comments underneath a blog post. 

There are times when I see a comment, a final reply, written in January 2011. Or October 2017. And it just hits me how recently they were still with us. Able to write that. Able to communicate, And how now that option was taken from them forever. It's crazy. But it fascinates me. And, weirdly, it calms me. ",20Feb2019,8

Chonker submission greatly appreciated!  


&gt;Debt is a trap, especially student debt, which is enormous, far larger than credit card debt. It's a trap for the rest of your life because the laws are designed so that you can't get out of it. If a business, say, gets in too much debt, it can declare bankruptcy, but individuals can almost never be relieved of student debt through bankruptcy.

118,"Hi. 13 (f)

For a few hours I've felt this weird feeling in my left arm. Especially in my shoulder. My chest has felt really weird, and a little bit of pain in the side sometimes. I feel like it's starting to become a little bit harder to breathe / it feels shorter to breathe.

I tried researching and I think I could be experiencing a mini heart attack or even a heart attack itself. Is this true? I doubt it since I'm way too young. Should I take medicine? God, I'm really nervous. I'm way too young to die. 

If it's not a heart attack, what is it and how do I get rid of it?",20Feb2019,1
119,"Anytime I go out, for example class today. I feel like I can't even focus on the subject at hand for more than five seconds, before worrying about how others see me, what I'm doing.

&amp;#x200B;

This happens everywhere in public. Gym, school, supermarket, driving. Whenever I'm at stoplights, I noticed I always look at the cars next to me to see if they're looking at me. I can't fucking stand it.

&amp;#x200B;

Why can't I just focus on me, there is so much I need to think about and focus on, and I waste so much god damn time thinking about what other people are doing, how they see me, how I look, how other people see what I'm doing, if I look like I'm paying attention. I'm driving myself fucking crazy.

&amp;#x200B;

Intellectually, I know I don't give a fuck or shouldn't give a fuck. But emotions just take over. A walk to class because a fucking social examination down to the way I walk. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is so embarrassing. I didn't have a good childhood at all, but it's been five years since I moved out. I've been this way since middle school. I don't do things I want to do or say because I don't think it fits how other people view me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I scream in my head that I don't care, and that I want to focus, but it doesn't work (obviously I guess). I don't know what to do. There is so much of life I need to think about, so much I need to do and get done and I get hung up on *other people*. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was diagnosed with PTSD in 2017, and I know I'm really hyper-aware, but not to this point. I feel so self conscious, and I think I read something about Imposter Syndrome. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any suggestions on what I can do to maybe improve and reduce this awareness?  ",20Feb2019,1
120,"I am going through a busy time right now. I am a English teacher at an international kindergarten in Japan and we are a few weeks away from our year end performance. Then I have the school graduation. In addition, I am moving back home (overseas) for the first time in 4 years and have to start over. 

I haven't been spending nearly enough time to get ready for that move; I need to find a job, get looking at places to live, but part of me knows that I am moving back to my parents house in my small town. I need to get out of there once I get back because that isn't healthy for me. I have a history of dealing badly in this kind of situation and it puts me into a depressive state which is even harder to get out of.

I am just struggling with the pressure of all the things to do, combined with this need to savour the rest of my time here. I feel like all my things that need to get done are fighting for priority and despite deliberate attempts to calm myself I can't remove this gnawing anxiety at all times. My jaw hurts from clenching in my sleep and I just want to wake up well rested and get shit done.

Anyone go/going through something similar? This trifecta is tearing me in different directions and I just want some advice/encouragement.",20Feb2019,1
