0,"I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls who were there a few hours (only 2 of them are involved here) later in the night near closing it was quiet and the blonde girl skipped up stairs to the toilet kept looking back at me giggling looking back down the stairs at me , a while later I walked around the corner to where they were sitting and that blonde girl was looking at me and I didn’t look away for a few seconds and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say to her brunette friend 'that lad just been staring at me' in an excited whisper way. (They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

 another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away. 


I then went back to finish cleaning the same table nearby and then the brunette girl said excuse me again twice and I looked then she asked politely but nervously pointing at me when asking  'can I ask you a serious question?' I looked then she went relaxed and said ‘have you got a girlfriend?' I ignored her, she then asked it again, then the blonde watching the whole thing said 'aww leave him alone....he’s dead cute’ and then ‘he probably has’ (probably has a gf) then smiled at me looking over (cute like puppy dog cute is that bad?) then the brunette asked it again ‘have you, have yet got a gf?’ ’ I still continued to ignore them but looked annoyed because they kept putting me off what I was doing (idk why maybe I was nervous) and the blonde girl said aww leave him alone now hes fuming while laughing a bit.

4,"Wow, I hate to post my personal life into my social media but I just felt like sharing this.... about two almost three months ago I had a severe mental break down and decided to cut my hair on my own. I knew I was going to regret it and cry over it later but I did it anyway out of pure desire of a change. I wanted to feel different. I wanted to leave my old self behind and to me my hair had a lot to do when it came to defining the woman I was.. and I no longer wanted to be that woman. I was done. So that's where my desire of cut my hair came. I did it. And at first I tried to embrace it and kept telling my self it would eventually grow back to my same length- even though that was a long process, especially to get it to the length I had it... - (I had to down almost close to my waist and I loved it...) and I just needed to be patient. I really got my self into the mentality that doing that would teach me patience. And it did. It's been almost 3 months and just now I realized my hair is almost back to my waist again!!!! I am so happy. I am finally feeling my self again. These 2-3 past months have been so much growing and learning for me. Just in 2-3 months I learned to live day by day, to live my present and be patient. I've been praying every single day for patience. Not one day have I missed patience in my prayers. And today I finally realized this whole time I've been learning what patience is. 
My point is, regardless how difficult of the situation one is stuck in just trust the time. Trust divine timing. It is everything. 3 months ago I was completely lost. Mentally and emotionally I was devastated. Now, 3 months later absolutely everything is falling into place. Every single thing. I've been working on my mental and emotional health and even though I still have my moments I am doing a lot better than I was and I am very grateful for absolutely everything. 3 months later I am feeling genuinely happy with who I am, with my self, with my life. I am happy and I know this was super long but I had to share. 

Never never lose faith. Things always, always get better.😊",19Apr2019,5

12,"So I know this is controversial. Some ppl say not to get involved at all, but I always tell the girls when I find out their guy is cheating on them. I’ve been cheated on by every guy I’ve been with and know how horrible it is. It’s the worst feeling in the world and I’d have wished I would’ve learned of it sooner. 

I think I’ve told 5 diff girls of their guys cheating on them. Most of the time they’re appreciative, although I’ve also had them get mad at me, and most of the time they get back with the guy despite expressing their appreciation to me. I told my ex’s gf that he cheated on me with her when they got together, and she basically didn’t care &amp; told me he wouldn’t do her that way. Some of the times, I became emotionally invested in the guys. It fucking hurt to find out that I was helping these guys cheat on their gfs. So I’ve posted about all of my exes who cheated on me, and about several fuckbuddies who were cheating on their girls about what they did on cheating sites. If you google their names, some of them come up on cheating sites with the words “cheaterland” on their faces.

I know this is controversial. I know some think cheating is a forgivable offense &amp; that somebody’s name shouldn’t be smeared online because of this. &amp; I know that most ppl don’t take cheating as seriously as I do. But as someone who’s been cheated on &amp; treated as the other women, I know how awful it is. It’s a true reflection of the person’s character and the world should be warned about it.",19Apr2019,4

14,"I stayed up all night last night working on a computer science project. I didn't even get a tenth of it done!! It was so stressful. It wasn't a matter of me putting in the time. Before I could even start the project I had to cram and catch up on a lot. And it's not cut and clear there's no 1 right answer. And I had to do a calculus problem set last night too..  


I took a cold shower at 7am. I got ready for class. I figured I could work on my project in the back of the class and still get the clicker points (we get remotes that answer questions in my economics class). You could show up the whole day and get the questions wrong and get a zero. I hate it. My professor decided to let the TA lecture for once. I don't like her very much. She's rude, condescending, and she just answers your questions with questions. I swear I asked her so many questions on my hw that she didn't help with and those are the exact problems I lose points on. Whatever. Anyways... our usual prof is funny and lighthearted, he takes it pretty easy. She goes up to the blackboard and I knew I was fucked. I couldn't just go on my laptop in the back. She writes down a bunch of mathy shit tryna look fancy and everyone is like 'wtf'. I scribble a bunch of notes and I'm thinking ""I know/hope he won't test on this."" She's just trying to flex.

&amp;#x200B;

Next I drop by my math class. I just turned in my math hw, signed the attendance and left class early. Except I didn't go home. I went to office hours w/ my prof. Where I shared her tiny room with 5 other students. As we all barraged her with questions.  


I had my first bite to eat around 2pm. EXCEPT I WASNT DONE!! I had a computer sci interview grade. (How it works is that we get interviewed/quiz to check we really wrote our own code and just to quiz us.) I studied so hard between 2 to 430pm. I did it. It went fine.  


I had a 5-615pm computer sci recitation. We just sit down and work by ourselves, ask the TA if we have any questions. I just used the time to talk to the two people who sit in my table. And I like them. One's a cool guy from my hometown the other is a cute girl (that's taken) but I just love talking to.  


I made a promise to myself that I would stay sober for a while because smoking weed can give me some anxiety and I have to do good this semester. Idk why but I called this frat guy I know from high school and his roommate sold me some edible candy. I ate it and now I'm starting to feel it.

22,"So I was in the shower and suddenly understood why I had so much trouble in grade school.

It's not just because I didn't understand what was going on around me. I could get straight A's when I put in the effort to restrain myself, but otherwise, on quizzes and exams, I'd always, *always* answer questions with ""wrong"" answers intended to highlight what I perceived as logical flaws on the educators' parts, either in the questions themselves as they were posed on the test, or in the way the concepts had been explained in class. I was too young and immature to properly voice my discontentments about the quality of the education I was receiving, so instead I just vented all the time and acted out my problems with authority by being a smartass -- giving test answers I knew the teacher would see as wrong, but that I fully intended to defend as technically correct, at least under the precise literal interpretation of their prior explanation of the topics under consideration.

When I realized that, that was when I realized which of my own personality flaws compelled me to behave this way at the time. The answer is impatience. When it comes to learning, I'm the type of learner who demands to be presented with every last iota of information and edge cases, in full detail, immediately. I pay very close attention to the material being taught, and if there's any part of it that doesn't make perfect and complete sense the instant I hear or read it, my heart instantly wells up with frustration and resentment, like I'm being talked down to -- like they think I'm stupid, and I'm not expected to understand as much about the material as I already do -- like I'm expected to just mindlessly soak it up like a sponge instead of actually making an effort to comprehend it. If I'm not given enough information about a concept to fit it into the framework of the other concepts I've learned that have led up to it, my mind rejects it. I don't absorb it, I mentally throw it on the ground in disgust and spit on it. I instantly decide it's foolish, or a lie, and start searching for alternative truths on my own.

Is this a normal way of approaching academic work? What was I supposed to do? How should I have functioned in a school environment like this? I guess I could have just tried to be more patient and just regurgitated what I was told, and if I encountered any perceived inconsistencies then I'd just have to be quiet about it and wait for a better explanation later in the course or in a future course -- but if I'd done that, half my brain probably would have just rotted out of my skull. I swear I would've had a stroke or something. Use it or lose it as they say. So what was I supposed to do?",19Apr2019,6

24,"For the last few years I’ve known that I wanted to join the military. In my freshman year of high school I considered joining the marines but I put the idea on the side because my mom absolutely hated the idea. I continued through school and got together with my current boyfriend at the end of my junior year. 
At the beginning of my senior year, recruiters for different branches of the military came to class to talk to us. My dream of going into the armed forces bloomed again and I started to seriously consider joining the military. I made a plan to join the Army National Guard while in college so that I could get my degree and then re-enlist as an officer once I’d graduated. I went to MEPS (Military Entrance Processing Station) during my senior year in high school but was disqualified because I didn’t meet the height/weight requirements. It crushed me for a while and I felt sad and angry that I wasn’t allowed to do something I’d wanted to do for a while. I attempted to gain weight for months, but stayed at the same weight. 
Months later, my boyfriend left for basic training at Fort Sill and I began my first semester at college. Slowly, I began to gain weight over time. I got to my “goal weight” and decided to go back to MEPS to try and enlist again. A week ago, I raised my right hand and said an oath to my country. I am honestly so ecstatic and happy with my decision. My boyfriend is happy for me, and I can’t remember being this excited to do something. My mother didn’t share my enthusiasm. She hated the thought of me going into the military and thought that when I enlisted I was signing my own death certificate. She believes the absolute worst possible thing is going to happen to me and I think she despises me. She expressed her concern and disapproval multiple times but it never influenced my decision because of how badly I wanted to do this. Since I’ve joined she doesn’t talk to me about enlisting- she doesn’t want to talk about it at all actually. She expressed her anger any chance she got before I joined, but now that I’ve signed my name- she doesn’t say anything. My dad just seems disappointed in me. He told me multiple times before I joined, “you know we can help you pay for college, if that’s why your joining, you don’t have to.” It was the most depressing thing to hear, it was almost like he was begging me not to join. Lastly, my little brother has this sudden hostility towards my boyfriend and I since I’ve joined. He texted me to ask if my boyfriend was treating me right and if he pressured or forced me into joining.

I lay in my bed, 1 in the morning, thinking about all the shit that’s gone down and all the good times i use to have, only to realize it’s all gone. 

I’ve managed to lose 3 close friends within the last 4 months, simply because i don’t know what it means to be a friend and well i either over communicate or don’t communicate at all for like a month. 

On top of that, I fucked up such a great opportunity i had with this girl i really liked, and was (unintentionally, because i lack fucking social skills) a complete ass hole to her, basically ignoring her (this is a story in itself). 

This all happened within the span of 4 months or so. 2019 has been an absolute shitter for me so far.

My values don’t really align with the world. Sometimes I feel like I want to just escape. Society is fucked.

I’ve watched shows like black mirror and osmosis on Netflix. You know that scene where the girl in osmosis enters a virtual reality where she has the perfect lover Tom who satisfies her in every way she pleases? I wouldn’t mind that... bc I’m convinced I’ll never find love. The kinda love I want likely doesn’t exist and nobody can convince me otherwise. Real people in the real world are fucked.

29,"Broke up with my girlfriend of three years in my junior year of highschool, about a year ago. She was great and I really enjoyed the time we spent together. But the relationship got pretty whipped towards the end and couldn't hang out with some of my female friends and she held me back from some of my guy friends and my personal hobbies. I thought, for personal growth, and the fact I had one year left in high school before college, it was for the best if I broke up with her. We were best friends before dating and we are all in the same friend group. 

I broke up with her in the most friendly and nicest way possible. Of course when I broke up with her, she started to dislike me, and reasonably so.  Rarely do I talk to her and not receive an eyeroll or a complaint from her. I get it and I expect it, I'd be upset too and I have no anger or annoyance towards her reactions w/ me. My issue is that she tends to be much more social than I am and when she's hanging out with friends, rarely do they want to invite me because the ""conflict that is created when we are together"". Also understandable, but I find myself more often at home being ghosted by life-long buddies when I see on social media they are hanging out with her. I'll text them a week in advance to plan something and they'll say ""Sorry, plans with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"". I don't  have an issue being around her, I guess friends know she doesn't like me being around so when I text they just either say, ""Sorry bro \_\_\_\_\_ is here"" or ghost me entirely. This break up was suppose to allow me to be more social and expand as a person but it has limited me social and emotionally. I have trouble pulling ""things"" into more with new girls and I constantly find myself at home over thinking. Even my other group of friends that I spend time with on discord playing games has started to disassociate with me and I rarely find myself playing videogames or writing (two things I had a big passion for) or doing anything productive. Don't know if it's all in my head or not but I truly feel like I don't have anyone to really talk to about it. I can't even turn to drugs as I absolutely despise being high and only makes me feel shittier. Sorry for the rant. Created alt JUST incase and for future ranting and similar posts

I hoped onto the first lane, then two others kept on yelling at me what to do. Out of stress, I switch to the other lane after speeding throughly.

Sure, I was a kid and probably not great but what kid is?  I'm sure you can imagine the relationship I had with my dad after hearing how he thought about me.

I don't know if I just lost interest in it, but it is a great hobby because you're outside/being in the moment for me.

39,"I’ve always had good empathy and am really good at processing emotions.

However, sometimes, it just feels like it’s too much.

This is where the lunacy bit comes in- I feel as though I can somehow pull emotions off of people and even feed off of them.

An example is how I have a coworker who is a truly lovely woman, and she struggles with depression. First half of the day she’s working all the while staving off tears. I thought to myself how I wish I could make her feel better, However, by the end of the shift she’s happy and joking yet I feel emotionally drained and just annoyed with EVERYONE.

Another clue to this is my ability to work with mentally handicapped people. They seek me out like a puppy looking for a stick. Truly I don’t mind, I wanted to be a SpEd teacher.

However, I come to my cousin who is severely autistic and she has never cared for anyone touching her- not even her own mother getting her dressed in the morning. However, whenever I came to visit, she had to be on top of me holding my hand.

In high school there was a girl who had Down’s Syndrome and she had to sit next to me on the bus every day. She was my bus buddy for my senior year and she was awesome. I don’t know how out of a ton of people to chose from, she chose me as a friend and I think my empathy had something to with it.

42,"I've seen several posts about autistic kids and how their parents are tired of it, can't do it anymore etc. I just wanted to hopefully help someone with an autistic kid if they come across this post. Didnt know where else to post it...

My brother has an autistic kid and he used to throw tantrums over turning right instead of left in the car, cry over things that make you think ""WHY?!""  he still cant speak etc. Typical autistic kid.

Autistic kids like to be stimulated, they love music and have different interests than other kids. YouTube has helped so much. My brother got him a tablet and my nephew goes on YouTube and listens to music. You should consider that. Introduce him to music and see if he likes it, it would really help give you a break.

Also, PICTURES, THIS WILL HELP WITH THE TANTRUMS. Autistic kids like to know where there are going, this is important, you will make your life easier if you showed him where you are going, you'll also make his life easier. Imagine not understanding anything, not knowing what's going on then your parents drag you out and take you somewhere you don't know or you simply dont know where you are going, not a good feeling.

So take pictures of places you often go to, to go shopping take a picture of that shopping center, to give him a bath, take a picture of the bath, take a picture of the park before going out if you're going to the park, take a picture of his school etc. Everything. Take pictures of the food he usually eats or likes or toilet and teach him to use these pictures to communicate with you when he needs something.

Print them, stick them in a book and everytime you're going out, show him where with these pictures. Everytime he cries and you dont know why, show him that book to figure out what he wants or needs once you taught him what it is for.

This will definitely help with the tantrums, my nephew got used to it. Whenever he wants, grapes, he will show the picture of grapes and his parents then know what he wants, no tantrums, of he wants to pee he shows them the toilet picture and they will take him to the bathroom. It's simple! If they're going to the park, they show him the park and he let's them get him dressed instead of running away and crying and kicking because he doesnt know where they're going. Sometimes he does comply but then cries in the car because he realizes he doesnt know where you're headed so the pictures help a lot.

This is commonly used for autistic kids, please think about doing this, it will help you loads, this and music/YouTube.",19Apr2019,301

i’ve been feeling really bad about my body. i feel really gross and chubby so i can see why i feel guilty about eating. i keep telling myself that i need to eat and basically starving myself is going to make things worse but i can’t stop the whole losing my appetite and feeling guilty thing.

(They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

 another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away. 


I then went back to finish cleaning the same table nearby and then the brunette girl said excuse me again twice and I looked then she asked politely but nervously pointing at me when asking  'can I ask you a serious question?' I looked then she went relaxed and said ‘have you got a girlfriend?' I ignored her, she then asked it again, then the blonde watching the whole thing said 'aww leave him alone....he’s dead cute’ and then ‘he probably has’ (probably has a gf) then smiled at me looking over (cute like puppy dog cute is that bad?) then the brunette asked it again ‘have you, have yet got a gf?’ ’ I still continued to ignore them but looked annoyed because they kept putting me off what I was doing (idk why maybe I was nervous) and the blonde girl said aww leave him alone now hes fuming while laughing a bit.

49,"I never grew up to watching porn. I always just listened to it. I came across a website on erotic self-hypnosis around high school. I got into files that altered your personality, made you think you were a sex-crazed animal or dumb jock who couldn't think of anything but sports and sex. Got into college and I stopped listening to them. After graduating, now that I have a job as a digital artist, I'm back on those files. 

For context, those permanent files train you by planting subliminal cues that, with enough consistency, will snowball into greater changes overall to your personality. Think of it like 30-45 minutes of hypnosis with someone giving you light nudges to think differently, like choosing more stereotypically masculine activities like sports and cars. The files also tell you to accept the changes and slowly let go of what you used to do. 

The files became more alarming to me when I started listening to this one that pushed you into your ideal picture of masculinity. Less extreme than the dumb jock files and has more room for positive change, right? But it got weird when I started picturing a close friend. It's becoming hard for me to just be friends with him now because he's becoming a reference, and I can't stop thinking about him, or rather what he would do. I think I see him as someone ideal because he's confident, disciplined, and completely at one with himself. The files I'm listening to tell me to pay attention to sound like him, pay attention to the way he talks, get into the things he's into, etc. And I catch myself acting on those changes, and the decision making that the files planted in me. Like when I listen to music now, at the back of my head I start thinking ""is this the music I should be listening to? Or will your friend rather do this?"", same with food and clothes. It's just weird because I guess there are big parts of myself that I like but the files feel like they'd lead to some serious self-destruction.   


I'm 24 and I really want to settle this now that my family-friends-work life has been getting more and more /real/ for lack of better words. I've read around a lot that I should embrace my sexual fantasies and fetishes? But I don't know about embracing them if what turns me on is the destruction of my identity. When I listen to the files it feels like I'm becoming an entirely different person, even after. But as soon as the files sink too deep it starts getting real and I pull out of it and I feel the guilt of what I'm doing. I'm living a pretty decent life, and I don't feel like there's anything missing but does my listening to files mean I want to/should be this other person? Recently I've been reading around a lot about LSD and psilocybin and I'm contemplating on listening to the files on those to finally nail the coffin on the change, but I can't help but feel like that isn't the right way to go about this. Days like this I wish I could just be like a normal dude but thoughts like that fuel the fire to listen to the files even more, if that makes sense. Like ""damn I wish I was just into more normal dude stuff so ok I guess I'll listen to these files that would make me like every other dude but then I know I'm liked and love for what I am so what do I do now if it seems like I'm the only one finding wrong in myself?""

&amp;#x200B;

There's 2 frames of thought going on right now with me – 

1. My personality's going to change eventually and if I listen to this it would've been inevitable anyway. People go through therapy or take more conscious efforts to change their unwanted traits so this shouldn't be different right?
2. That friend's personality and identity went through decades of experience you can never grasp by mere observation. That and you're about the only person who says you need to reengineer your identity.  


I think I'm here because I'd like to know other people's thoughts on this, what you guys think I should do and idk more sober insight. I posted something like this on the self-hypnosis site's forums and it seemed just biased because almost everyone there's very encouraging with *whatever* you listen to. Lots of dark stuff down that site. Think files that make you obsessed with shrinking your penis, and suggestions to make you incontinent...

I'm 13 years old and I'm a male. So basically for the past 5 months or so I've been experiencing these symptoms:

\- I get overwhelmed easily

\- I feel a little depressed and quite empty

\- I can't think straight, I can't concentrate

I've been trying to figure out what's wrong with me and it dawned on me that it may be chronic sleep deprivation. I usually get like 4-6 hours of sleep or something a day (l also used to wake up at 4 am everyday last year after going to sleep at like 11pm - 1am). Are these symptoms consistent with chronic sleep deprivation? I am not experiencing any physical symptoms, only psychological.

52,"I’m pretty young so I’d say anything I’ve gone through is basically nothing anyway but every time I had a bad day my cat would be there to sit on my lap and make me feel better, when it was cold he would warm me up. 

He was there at home through both of my grandparents deaths, the time in my life when I didn’t really have any friends and he just always made me feel like I had at least one friend in the world. He used to watch me play games and everything. 

By the end of my freshman year I was very unhappy to the point where I got sick and stayed that way for about a year. Just after the start of my sophomore year my cat also got sick, there was something wrong with his spine and his back legs stopped working. We asked a vet and she suggested we put him down so we did. I was too sick to go with him to the vet so he just went with my dad.

The game was was like this, the teacher will pick out random names from a bowl and she'll ask 'personal questions' to those lucky students. 

What a weird teacher I know. Anyways, after she asked each student questions which they were obviously embarrassed to answer, she called out my crush's name next. She asked him, ""Which girl do you like in this class?"" He blushed and refused to answer so the teacher asked him another question, ""If you don't want to answer, then at least tell us which girl do you think is the most friendly to you?""

 And deep down in my heart I knew that he would probably pick Mary ( that's not her real name)  cause she's the prettiest girl in our class but he said my name instead. My friends teased me the rest of the day after that. Honestly, I didn't know what to feel, I was shocked at first but I was both happy and sad. 

Happy because he choose me and sad because of the fact that I just got friendzoned  I think? I over think a lot okay? The next day he started acting weird and awkward around me and would not talk to me, then the next day he went back to his old self and started teasing me. I am so confused.

Dear past me,

You’ve been through a lot. You know what it’s like to wake up in the morning wanting the day to end already. You know what it’s like to wake up in the morning wishing you never woke up. You know how horrible it all felt and how lonely you were and all you wanted was for someone to pull you out of the water before you drowned but for some reason, you also wanted to drown because drowning was better than living. It was difficult not to feel helpless even in an environment where almost everyone you loved offered to help.

You always felt like you had to go through it alone, that you couldn’t just make everyone else suffer for you even if you wanted to so badly, that it was easier this way, that nobody would understand anyway. You’ve reached the point where you couldn’t even imagine ever getting better. Being cured of whatever it was that inflicted you. You thought there was no point, no hope. It was only a matter of time before you got completely engulfed by the darkness if you weren’t already.

You just wanted it to end. No more numbness. No more forcing yourself to cry when you couldn’t. No more forcing yourself to stop crying when your eyes never seemed to run out of tears. No more darkness. No more fake smiles. No more hiding. No more lies. No more. It hurt so much, and you don’t even know why it hurt. Why you? Why now? Why wouldn’t it stop? 

You were reduced to almost nothing, or at least that was how you felt. But it’s not over yet. You were broken, you probably still are. But it is important to remember that you are more than your depression.

So many things have tried to break you before, yet you stood undefeated. Depression may be the worst opponent so far but it’s just another storm to overcome. And you can handle storms. You yourself are one hell of one. Everything that you are suffering through, I am not invalidating. They’re as real as the air you breathe.

The stigma, depression’s faithful servant, is as deadly as the culprit itself. But you’re not alone. You never were. Stop depriving yourself of the love around you.

I know you’ve started already. It’s going to be a very long journey. But I promise you that you will heal, as every creature heals. And one day, you will be able to breathe relief and you will start waking up in the morning feeling calm and peaceful more often than you would’ve thought possible and that’s all because you chose to live instead of drown and I am proud of you. Overwhelmingly proud. And you will continue to fight because that’s just what life is all about. You’re so young. You have so much to live for. And it doesn’t matter if you find yourself turning 40 with little to write on your resume. You’d still be young. You’d still have so much to live for. And you will continue to fight because that’s just what life is all about.

Maybe one day in the future, depression will again greet you at your door and that’ll be okay because you would’ve known more and you would be able to handle it better. Ernest Hemingway was right. You would be stronger in the places where you have been broken. I am a testament to that. I don’t know when this particular storm would pass but I am looking forward to us. I believe in us. You didn’t then but I do now. And I think that makes all the difference. Keep fighting, dear.

Love always,

Present me",19Apr2019,234
58,"My wife found a really old book at a garage sale. Titled ""The American Educator: Encyclopedia"" (loose-leaf extension).

Near the end of the book, it has the following paragraph:

&gt;No Resignation. The election left the American political structure unbalanced; that is, opposing parties control executive and legislative branches. This irksome situation has prevailed frequently in American history. However, some Democratic supporters and legislators issued suggestions for President Truman's resignation. Ignoring the idea, the President released a conciliatory statement, offering to work with the 80th Congress for the ""welfare of all the people."" Aboard, the election results stirred more uneasiness than satisfaction. Some nations feared a revival of ""America First"" politics in trade and international relations. Republican leaders, though, promised no backsliding into the old well of isolationism.

You enjoy the efforts of thousands of years of work put in by the minds that refused to accept what they had, and aspired for more. The minds that questioned, criticised and built upon what had previously existed. 

Yet many will not accept the smallest of criticisms to their ideas, beliefs, lifestyles or work done in their names. They let their fears of being wrong get in the way of positive progression, not even remotely considering that the opposer may be correct and for the better. 

Yes, it is easy to push one to the sidelines when you hear criticism you dislike. 
Yes, you can spend the rest of your lives in ignorance and never seek the grander image. 
Ironically enough, you can ignore this very post. 
You can do this to years end, and your life will mean nothing more than a few fading memories, lost to an ocean of numbers. 
Nothing more than a statistic. 

What if you just let free?
What if you gave every valid idea or criticism fair chance to your thought rather than just mindlessly reject it? 

Either you counter the opposer and they learn something new or you learn something new, but this can only happen if you're willing to learn. 

Regardless of wether the idea is as small as a friends careless alcohol consumption or as large as the religious, social and political ideologies the our human race is built upon, never be afraid to criticize. 
Always remember that you can respect people, but you do not have to respect the ideas they hold.

I’m still lost and I haven’t got a clue what I want to do or who I want to be. I’m turning 18 soon and I feel the pressure creeping up on me, y’know that pressure to ‘know who you are’ or ‘have a plan set’. 

I feel like all my lost puzzle pieces have to be brought together and arranged into a proper person soon. I’m entering adulthood and I still feel like a child, I don’t know what to do and I don’t know if I can do what I have to.

The reason I’m having doubts is because I feel like I jumped the gun on my decision. I don’t know if I can do something like this. I have ideas for stories, an eye for photography, the desire to make something people will love, but there are literally so many more people who have all that stuff and then some.

She was smarter than me for sure, but I got in cause of some admissions programme where the school interviews you and looks at your portfolio. 

While I did get in cause the lecturers liked why I had or probably saw potential in me, I can’t shake the feeling of unease. There’s a common saying in the school: “Your passion will be your fuel”. I just don’t feel that passion cause of this feeling of doubt. I feel like I’m way out of my head. I’m lost and confused and I don’t know where else to go. It also doesn’t help that my seniors keep telling me to make good connections with my classmates, especially since literally everyone else knows each other and I’m just that one guy who’s all alone.

Tl;dr - my father blamed my sister today for him breaking a glass of wine. Brought memories that I had buried for good reasons back. 


This literally happened less than an hour ago.
We were about to begin eating Paella, and my sister asked for the lemon. My dad grabbed it, and in the motion of giving it to my sister he bumped his hand into a glass of wine, knocking it over and it shattered. There was the usual pause/silence of shock for about 3 seconds and then he instantly complained about it being my sisters fault that HE broke the glass by not being careful.

This brought up memories of him doing a similar if not exact same thing in the past. When it first started out, it was barely noticable/a problem, as he would let any accidents slide by and would be very nice in helping to clean up and learn.
But it progressively got much worse, and 9 years ago (I was 10) was when I decided for the first time that I had enough and tried to kill myself. He blamed technology and me for trying that, but he never mentioned it other than to my mom, or when he got angry.
It was basically a routine, since every day for any problem, no matter how personal or how big, he would blame others than himself or the actual root of the problem.
He missed an exit at a roundabout? He gets angry that the copilot (commonly my mother) because ""she"" didn't tell him to exit (if she wasn't talking) or complain that she distracted him (if she was talking).
What if he's the copilot? Well any mistake my mother makes, he mentions it to her in the moment and complains about it for 5 minutes. If my mother tries to complain about him complaining or if she mentions what he does while driving, he goes crazy and just tells her to shut up.
Bad grades from your children because they are psychologically unstable and suffering? Blame them for not ""getting over it"" and also attack their hobbies or threaten to take something important away (for my sister it was her phone and being able to go outside/socialise, for me it was any piece of technology, even if he didn't own it, as the school I went to gave us laptops). 
Internet connection not working cause our ISP sucks? He literally would block any connection other than himself, and if we got through he would also change the password. And if it still was crap, he would then scream at everyone to get off of their technology and not do anything because he really needs it. 
Be attacked by your children verbally because you keep blaming them for your problems? Punish them, of course, and tell them that they have to respect you because you are their parent (yeah right, like anyone will respect someone like this).

As said before, I tried to kill myself, but the worst part is that I kept trying till I took a sudden turn and started vividly daydreaming me going complete psycho and brutally murdering my dad. And all of that just because of the never ending berating from someone who I should technically trust to protect me and help me, someone who basically just kept giving me signs of them hating me. 
Worst part is he never apologises for his behaviour. Not sure if its because he doesn't realize how shitty it is or if its because he doesn't want to lose some secret pride. To this day, anything he has said that might have hurt someone either physically, emotionally or psychologically, he hasn't apologised for. 

Either way, I'll cut contact with him as soon as I'm set for life, and for those who might worry about my mental health, I've been the happiest ever since I started university, as I don't have to stress about coming home to a screaming dad just because his day was bad or our grades are bad or he got contacted about something missing again or what not.",19Apr2019,1

The reason why I am asking for advice here is because about 3-4 weeks ago, I went for an interview with the college of nursing dean (IDK about other countries but in mine we undergo entrance exams and interview with the dean of the preferred college course prior to enrollment) and when he looked at my first semester grades for grade 12 he noticed that my grades dropped from line of 90s to 70s so he asked my what happened. I told him that during that time, I was experiencing health issues - both physically and mentally - and took really long absences to recuperate. He then advised that I go to a doctor and have myself checked because these health issues might affect my grades and standing during college. 

I am currently financially dependent on my parents and am a minor so everything that I do must be supervised by my parents/guardians which is kind of fine with me. The problem here is that my parents don't believe in the existence of mental illnesses (they are really outdated TBH - outdated Asians if I may say so) or if they believe that it exists, won't believe on the possibility that I might have any of those because they would only say ""Ah, you're just being overreacting"" or ""There's nothing wrong with you, see, you're even laughing right now."" 

Another problem is because I fear my parents. I fear of what consequences I might bring to my family if I ask for professional help because I at least partially know that any health abnormalities that I may have stems from their actions. My parents are really violent. Though I can say that my father has toned down a bit compared to when I was younger, they are both still violent. Whenever things don't go their way or when they argue with each other, plates, knives, and fists will be thrown at each other. 

/STORY TIME/
An example of their violence is during the final terms of the first semester of grade 12 in which I had an argument with my mother on her decision to go on a vacation back to her hometown. I disagreed with her decision because I won't have time to look after the house, my aged father(now 77 y.o) and my two younger siblings (I'm the eldest), because of the final exams are coming up and I have lots of performance tasks to do. She then started to say things about how she needs to go see our grandmother and how we, her children, are cruel to not let her see her own mother and how she just wished that we died when we were born, and I, out of anger and shock, told her why didn't she kill us at that time rather than let us live a shitty life where we have to suffer because of them. She got really mad at that that she started saying things about how God wouldn't want that (we are Roman Catholic by religion BTW) so I told her to stop justifying her actions by using God's name. SHE. WENT. BATSHIT. CRAZY. 

She went in the bathroom (I was taking a bath to get ready for school) and beat me and proceeded to kick my head hard against the tiled wall three times and did not stop beating me until I told her that I still have to go to school. 

I went to school with a really huge bump on the right side of my head and a really bad headache due to the impact. I went to the clinic after that and I was advised to take go take a CT scan of my brain and a skull x-ray, and take some time off from school to recuperate and it affected my grades and performance. One can say that I passed that semester because the teachers took pity on my situation.

I can enumerate more situations of where my parents used violence (mostly my mother). Like that time where my mother removed my nails when I was a toddler because I wouldn't stop sucking on my thumb or when she made me eat the body soap because I wouldn't stop complaining about how my eyes hurt due to the shampoo (I was toddler at that time too) and so on and so forth but that would make this too long.
/STORY TIME ENDS/

There might be some of you asking why I won't ask help from the following:

The counselors at my school. They don't really give a shit or two about it. The help there is pretty useless. 

The school teachers. Same. They don't really give a shit or two.

Other relatives. Maternal side - they pretty much side with my mom since she's the youngest. Paternal side - no contact.

My friends. I don't want to trouble them. They have their own troubles to tend to.

I don't really know where to turn to now, and I don't want to stay this way, I really need to secure my own future for my sake and for the sake of my younger siblings. So please, any advice will do, I need to get out of this hole.",19Apr2019,6

Criticism is often seen as being judgemental, insensitive or hate speech, when in reality the only way we can progress both our personal lives and the human race is through criticism. 

You enjoy the efforts of thousands of years of work put in by the minds that refused to accept what they had, and aspired for more. The minds that questioned, criticised and built upon what had previously existed. 

Yet many will not accept the smallest of criticisms to their ideas, beliefs, lifestyles or work done in their names. They let their fears of being wrong get in the way of positive progression, not even remotely considering that the opposer may be correct and for the better. 

Yes, it is easy to push one to the sidelines when you hear criticism you dislike. 
Yes, you can spend the rest of your lives in ignorance and never seek the grander image. 
Ironically enough, you can ignore this very post. 
You can do this to years end, and your life will mean nothing more than a few fading memories, lost to an ocean of numbers. 
Nothing more than a statistic. 

What if you just let free?
What if you gave every valid idea or criticism fair chance to your thought rather than just mindlessly reject it? 

Either you counter the opposer and they learn something new or you learn something new, but this can only happen if you're willing to learn. 

Regardless of wether the idea is as small as a friends careless alcohol consumption or as large as the religious, social and political ideologies the our human race is built upon, never be afraid to criticize. 
Always remember that you can respect people, but you do not have to respect the ideas they hold.

The day we learn to challenge rather than accept, is the day we will grow as a society, humanities future can encompass both towering greatness or crumbling dystopia, and it is all up to the hands of us.

76,"You know, I didn’t know it at the time but you were only taking advantage of me. I came from a family that showed very little love for me. I was depressed and suicidal. You came along and made me feel loved. I didn’t know it yet, but it was only lust and control on your end. I loved you with all my heart. You didn’t like condoms. You didn’t even try to pull out. And when I found out I was pregnant you told me it wasn’t possible. You told me not to tell anyone until you figured something out. Well he came 3 months early. I should have known then that you’d be a deadbeat. You wouldn’t go into the hospital to see him. You only did it when I threw a fit about it. I should have known when a year later you cheated on me then left me for her. I was 15 with a 1 yr old. Then you came back. You said it was a mistake and you’d never hurt me again, you said you missed your son. It wasn’t true, you were just lonely and saw that I was moving on. You wouldn’t let that happen. You didn’t want me but you didn’t want anyone else to have me. 2 years later I left you. You had been telling me for months that I made you unhappy. That I ruined your life. You said our son was stupid, retarded even.  You said it in front of him too. You yelled at me, got in my face, almost broke my finger trying to get into my phone. You pushed me into a wall, and slammed my head in a door. Why? Because I was moving on. I wasn’t with you. I was trying to find people, friends of my own. People that wouldn’t think of me as “A’s girlfriend/ baby mama” after that I had little contact with you. I was scared of you. Slowly you came back around and tried to have more to do with our son. Again, it was a lie. You broke my phone when I got proof of you saying you had watched me through my window on more than one occasion. After that I made you leave. You replaced my phone. But not as MY phone. You put me on your plan so that you’d have control over me again. I broke free of being on your plan, I started working on myself. I filed for child support. You said you wouldn’t pay anything to me unless you saw your son. I gave you multiple opportunities to come see him. You did once for a few hours. But every other time you said you’d come to see him, you didn’t. You broke your sons heart. One day he probably won’t remember you, but he’ll remember the dad that wasn’t there for him. He’ll remember that you never called to speak to him. He’ll remember all the things you didn’t do for him. He’ll remember never getting presents/ cards from his dads family. He’ll resent you for all the things you didn’t do. And one day you’ll realize that YOU fucked this up. That YOU did this to yourself. You’ll realize the reason your life is so shitty is because YOU fucked yourself over. And our son will be grateful that his mom held it together, that his mom took care of him, that his mom became a mother at 14, and despite her not so great family or upbringing, she did everything in her power to make him happy and to have a life better than hers. And he’ll hate you for leaving me to do it all by myself. Just like I will forever resent my parents for making me grow up so fast, and for making my grandmother take care of us, and like I’ll forever be grateful that my grandma took us in when no one else would. So with that being said, fuck you A.",19Apr2019,9
77,"Okay so here’s the scoop, I have this friend 22M who is my (23F) best friend. We have known of each other for a few years but just last year we slowly started becoming closer. For the first 3-4 months of the newly discovered closeness he had a girlfriend who he had dated for a year or two. When they broke up (he ended things with her) he had a usual time of sadness and anger. I was there for him and that’s when things got kicked into high gear. We spent everyday together, went on road trips, concerts, parties, you name it, we were there together. This continued over about 4 months. Then things started getting a little more interesting. I have always had a slight thing for him but during his “grieving” period I really pushed that aside and was his friend. I wasn’t about tying to start anything when he was sad and hurting. 

After that period was slowly ending we had stared sleeping in the same bed. At first it was because there would be no more space in the house after parties or concerts. It wasn’t weird, we would just go to bed and that was the end. Fast forward a couple of sleeps. One night he had asked me if we could snuggle so we did, and that sparked a whole new sleeping arrangement where I would sleep with him the majority of the nights, and we would cuddle. 

All this led up to one night where we were snuggling face to face. He had been a little restless  causing me to stir awake. He stopped moving, pretty sure it was so he wouldn’t wake me, but then we just inched closer and started kissing. It didn’t turn into anything else. We just held each other and kissed for a while, then went back to sleep. We had both talked about it the next day and both kind of brushed it off but that didn’t change anything, we were still together everyday, all the time, and would frequently spend the night in the same bed. 

Now to get to the point. Around the time we had started sleeping in the same bed is when he had started to put himself “back out there” and started to date again. I fully supported this and was happy to see him happy. Slowly over time, he started seeing more girls and he was getting comfortable with being single again. This wasn’t an issue until I started noticing that before all (or most) of his dates he would come to my house to hang out either right before or right after his dates. I would say this happened about 3/5 times. Didn’t matter if it was a casual hook up or a serious date. He always asked then came over. Around me he would be super flirty, friendly, and himself just a little more touchy sometimes nothing weird. But before a date or hook up he would be more calm, collected, and still himself just... less. 

Over time I have noticed that I am with him all day and parts of the evening but will have no problem ditching me at the end of a night downtown to be with some girl or meet up with his friends with benefits. Others also started noticing how he always kept me so close but then is happy to let me go for another girl. When I started to notice this, I tried to distance myself thinking that he wanted more space for dating, I didn’t want to stand in his way, but every time I would try to he would text asking me to hangout because he “needed me”. 

I’m at the point where I now have feelings for him. We have been though a lot and have grown together. He is my best friend and I can’t imagine my world without him. But I’ve had a couple of female friends tell me lately that it’s because he uses me for a stronger connection side of a relationship while he gets the physical side  from other women. I’m not sure if this is the same, though I feel it could be. 

If it is, I would like to know, is this something anyone else has experienced? If so, how do I handle it. I feel jealous of the other women he sees even though I don’t have a right to. I don’t know what to do with this information, I just need some advice. I don’t want to lose him, but I also don’t want to be a sideline connection when he feels he needs one.",19Apr2019,5
78,"Back in January of 2016, my older sister came to visit and brought her dog, which was a rottweiler. The dog was very obviously overstimulated as it was running around, pissing on the floor, and barking every 2 seconds. She had a million excuses for not putting the dog outside. ""there's no fence"" ""he's an indoor dog"" ""it's too cold"". So I was in the kitchen and I accidentally dropped a ceramic bowl on the floor. It made a pretty loud sound and the dog, which was only a few feet away, started freaking out, rapidly looking around. Then out of nowhere it charged at me and bit me right in the crotch. The pain was so bad my body pretty much shut down, all I could do was scream. My sister and my dad got in the room and pulled the dog off of me.

They called 911 and when I got to the hospital they had to put me out with anesthesia. When I woke up, I found out that while my legs had no serious damage, part of my genitalia was bitten off.

At the time, my sister was very apologetic and promised to compensate me for this. We never agreed on a dollar amount, but she promised to compensate me when she was able to.

For over a year I didn't say anything, I didn't want to push the issue. But I slowly started testing the waters by bringing it up subtly and eventually I just started asking her directly. Every time I asked her answer slowly moved closer to ""no"". Last week was the last straw. I asked her if she ever intended on paying me and she said ""I don't know I need to think about it"". At that point I snapped and we got into a huge argument. She said ""I don't owe you shit"" and ""get the fuck over it"" and hung up and we have not spoken since. I know she blocked my number too.

I wouldn't care and I would have gotten over it, but the dog bit of nearly half of my fuckin dick. I've only had sex with one girl but I didn't feel anything when we did it. I couldn't stay erect and that's probably why she left me. I never had sex before the incident happened so even though I'm not a virgin, I don't feel like i've had sex because I don't know what sex is supposed to feel like. And I probably never will.

If she paid me I'd feel better about it. I'd take a vacation, do a bunch of drugs, and forget about it for a while.

I brought up the prospect of pursuing legal action with my dad and he just yelled at me and told me if I did he would kick me out. I'm still in high school, but I'm pretty sure he legally can kick me out since I'm 18 now.

94,"A little backstory:


We dated for a few months and this past Monday she left me audio messages saying that I had a good life and didn’t deserve someone like her and her problems. Basically broke up with me. She had been going through other stuff (family problems, depression, job loss, etc.). She told me in one of the audio messages that she was going to deactivate WhatsApp for a few days until she gets back on her feet.


I didn’t respond to her right away. I asked one of her friends if she’s ok and she said my ex-gf wasn’t doing too well because of the job loss. She then asked me if I’ve seen my ex-gf’s WhatsApp profile pic lately to which I replied “No, she deactivated it.” Her friend came clean and told me that my ex-gf didn’t deactivate it, she just blocked me. And she had a picture of her and her bf as her new profile picture - which confirmed my earlier suspicion that she was dating another guy for longer than I am. She denied this when I asked her about him.


So with this information, I thought she didn’t deserve a response. I blocked her on social media. She found out about it Tuesday night and called me 10 times in two days. Sent me messages on Facebook asking if we could talk.

Her friend uncovered more stuff about her because I kept asking her. She also tried to ‘hurt’ her friend by trying to message a guy she’s dating.


Is it normal to feel sympathetic about her self-destructive behaviour? This along with her depression, physical and mental illness makes me feel guilty about not saying anything to her in the end. I feel like I added more stress to her life.


She’s lied to me multiple times, am I putting others’ feelings ahead of my own?",19Apr2019,2

100,"Crying as I write this. 

I have a 15 month old and life has been really stressful and hard since she was born because of one thing after another life things. Last year we had 4 family deaths, my husband had to go back to work a week after she was born and where we live, we have no family close so it’s been almost a year and a half of straight no sleep for me. I have Crohn’s disease but things have been getting worse and just got a new diagnosis of Ulcerative Colitis. I work from home but also am a stay at home mom so I never get a moment to myself. My husband is very helpful and supportive when he’s home but unfortunately works long hours so a lot is on me. 

I feel like no matter what I’m always behind. Behind in my work, behind in laundry, behind in dishes, behind in doing activities with my daughter because I’m behind in everything else. We live in California so shit is expensive. Where we live in the state is one of the most expensive places also. To put her in daycare just part time would be $800-$1000/month. We can’t afford that. I’ve tried finding a babysitter but everyone around here wants $20-$25/hour or the hours don’t work out with my work schedule. We are actively looking at other states to move too but just haven’t made a concrete decision yet. 

My anxiety is at an all time high. When I wake up in the morning, my thoughts are racing through my mind about everything that I have to accomplish in a 12 hour period. 

In my head (and my husbands) I pictured having another baby around when my daughter turned 2. But at this point, I feel like we shouldn’t have anymore kids because I’m already failing at being a mom. Today has been really hard and I just feel stuck and like a complete failure.",19Apr2019,2
101,I got my ACT test results in today. Friends and family are all proud of me but I'm upset with myself. I anticipated better. I practiced and prepared for months and I'm just disappointed because I know I could have done better. I got a 26 composite. 24 on the math 25 on the science and English and a 31 on the reading.,19Apr2019,1

103,"I just need to get this off my chest. 

I'm tired of living. I'm tired of fighting, and it feels as though life is just dragging my exhausted self along now. I have anxiety, social anxiety, and other emotional issues, and I'm quite tired of trying to fight them all. They haven't gotten any better. It just seems hopeless at this point, like I'm fighting a losing battle. 

I wake up and basically just wait around for the day to end again, only for the exact same thing to start the next day. I have things to do but never am able to do them all due to lack of motivation, so they add up, adding to the stress. 

I don't have any friends despite my efforts of trying to make at least one. I think by now I've just convinced myself that I don't need them. I've never really had any friends to be honest, so I've just given up and decided that I'm simply not a person worth being friends with. 

I've hidden the majority of my true feelings from my family for years. I've learned through experience that it's better not to trust and tell anyone things because things'll only get worse. There's so much they don't know/understand. I'm told that I'm lazy and don't care, or that I just need to be positive and everything'll be fine. I've been told that I tell myself people don't like me just so I can sit around feeling bad for myself. There's so many things they assume they know about me, when in reality I'm hiding the fact that I'm emotionally being torn apart from the inside out, and they're helping it.

I know I need help, but again, I keep convincing myself that I can handle it all myself, or that telling someone in my life will only make it worse. I have a therapist, but I've kept all these feelings and issues a secret. I just keep everything inside, and I've been doing it for years. It's destroying me. 

At this point, I don't know what to do. Nothing seems worth it anymore. I'm just here, being dragged along by life. I'm unhappy and have been for a while. I feel so trapped.",19Apr2019,1
104,"Well, I did it. I typed my first ever resume after a bunch of YouTube videos on how to and submitted my first job application... I'm preparing to get rejected but I'm also not hopeless about it. I graduated high school at 16, which I made a note of, and mentioned that I know the store lay out very well because of how often I enjoy shopping there. 
No matter what the outcome of it is, I'm still proud of myself. Another huge step into the independent life I want...",19Apr2019,1

106,"Didn't know where else to post this. 

I live in the UK and I was getting a train back from a town in the Midlands on the way home to the North West. On the first leg of the journey up to Birmingham, I had to get on a train that had lots of football fans heading to a game. It was incredibly full and overcrowded, meaning I had to stand in an area where the doors were.

I ended up being stood with incredibly drunk football fans. One of them was especially loud and over the top. He asked me if I knew what team was playing today (I did as I'm a big football fan) and he said he'd thought I'd reply with something Warhammer related. All of his mates started laughing.

He kept asking me lots of questions like why I'm travelling, how long it is etc. I was travelling back from my boyfriends house (I'm gay and in a long distance relationship) so I made up a lie saying I was on the way back from my family's. I messed up a little bit with my story so he kept shouting that I was 'bullshitting', which I was, but it didn't help.

I got off the train feeling really shitty and embarrassed, these were all males in their mid to late 20s and I'm 19. This has made anxiety that I already had even worse now and I'm scared about this situation happening again. I tried my best to laugh it all off and not show any weakness but I'm worried about next time.

What should I do next if I ever find myself in this situation? It was awful.",19Apr2019,0
107,"It's my mom's 49th birthday and I'm about to meet her at the bar. I like playing Keno as it helps pass the time and I'm not much of a drinker. 

So I need two sets of 5 numbers. They have to be 1-80. Only pick one and then I'll take the first 5 responses.

Then the next 5 responses will be for the second ticket. So if you are the 6th-10th comment you can choose a number that was listed in the first 5 comments. 

Then I usually don't play 10 numbers but I will for this occasion. 

They have to be between 1 &amp; 80
Comments 1-5 will make up the first ticket
Comments 6-10 will be ticket #2(and the numbers can be repeats from the first 5)
And comments 11-20 will make up the last ticket. (Again, they can be repeats from earlier drawings)

Forgive the repetitive nature of the description but I'm sure some people aren't real familiar with Keno so I wanna make sure they understand if they do in fact wanna throw a number out. 

If I make $20 on any of the tickets I will buy some gold and give it to the folks responsible:)

Thank you fellow redditors!

P.s. I will try and post a link so if anyone is bored and wants to see the drawing, they can:)",19Apr2019,1
108,"As I've finished my English degree these last couple years, I've continued to feel like perhaps I wasn't a true writer. Many of my fellow students would often short stories, bringing them to class. I had myself convinced that I had no talent for fiction, that I wasn't a creative enough person to do it. 

I guess I realized though that I *am* a writer. I've been writing since I was probably 11 years old, joining Gaia Online and role-playing via essay-long posts which would describe the life and actions of a character whom I had created myself. Throughout the course of a 'campaign' I probably would have written upwards of 30-50 pages based off the life of a single character. 

I've since lost access to the account, though I've always half-wished I could look back at my writing as an 11 year old. On the other hand, I'm sure I would now be quite embarrassed by it's quality.

It might not be considered as 'true' as sitting down and writing a story in Microsoft word, or via pen and paper. But at least I know it's something I enjoyed doing. I still spend a ton of time writing online, though I tend to focus more on non-fiction then fiction now. 

I think I might finally gather the courage to write my own story, and not for the sake of posting to a message board.",19Apr2019,2
109,"When you get a dog, you take on the responsibility for their life. You should never go into it blindly, idiotically, thinking that a big dog’s puppy will just be small forever.

111,"He meowed at me and just walked on in and slept on my sofa like he owns the place a couple days ago. I live in a rural place next to **the** grocery store. It is equally possible that he jumped out of a car window while his owner was at the store or that he was abandoned here. Many peoples cats like to ride in the car with them apparently. I put up a found cat poster at the message board at the store. If no one claims him what do I do? Id rather give him cuddles for the rest of his life than sentence him to death at the local shelter. No one ever goes there. Its next to the dump for a reason.

If I cant find his owner is there a way I can find him someone that will love him and treat him? Hes so sweet. He doesn't deserve to die or be lonely at a shelter.",19Apr2019,1
112,"I was merging onto traffic today, turning right and the guy in front of me suddenly stopped and I ran into the back of him. He was stopped and I was going like 10 mph. My front right bumper is dented and my headlight is pushed in. The others guys car is completely fine, but he got out the car rubbing his neck. I didn’t say a word to him and called the cops and my insurance.

I got a ticket since I was at fault, which I was. I’m just really bummed about it all. Since it’s my fault, I’ll have to pay my high deductible to get it fixed.

114,"I’ve been reading some really depressing stories on reddit lately and I think it’s starting to get to me. So many people die young from cancer, accidents, seemingly just out of nowhere.

i got home from his farewell party that i organized wiTh the other best friend and where i heard that she “”has fEeLinGs”” for him and i was just venting to my #1 and i took my pants off and i said goodbye to her so i could just stare at the ceiling, listen to lofi, and cry. i hate that i cried though because i really do feel like i’m over him but huh guess i’m a dirty Liar. i’m annoyed that this affects me so much and also that i’m still posting this and i don’t know why bc i’ve already vented to my bestie but. here this is and if you don’t have any advice or support,,, i’ll gladly accept an f in response instead.",19Apr2019,1

119,"So, I have always seen ""double"" - I can focus on an object, but anything I'm not focusing on, I see two of. This has been this way my entire life, I assumed it was normal. Today, while on a trip with my fiance, I mentioned off-hand something like ""you know when you're looking at something far, you can see two of the close objects?"" He said ""......... Babe that's not a thing?""

So we playfully argued for a bit because I was solidly convinced that that was how everyone saw the world. We then decided to call my parents - they would set it straight and tell me that's normal, right?

Nope. *APPARENTLY* your brain naturally stiches images in your field of vision together, so you should only see one of everything. I was floored. But, as my family pointed out, this explains *so much*. 

I am the clumsiest person possibly in existence. I am physically so awkward I am constantly running into walls and breaking things.

I have, like, no depth perception. Can't catch for shit and trip on everything, all the time.

I was always super confused at the shooting advice to keep both eyes open. When I would go to the shooting range and keep both eyes open, I could focus on the target but I'd see two scopes, so I just lined the target between them, all while thinking that doesn't seem helpful at all.

121,"Guy was Japanese and in his fifties, a rabid anti vaxxer to the point of unhealthy obsession and would copy paste spam 20 paragraph long rants about how vaccines are evil and how Google is run by evil Jews / how Jews rig elections.

He also thought women who were molested were all liars and he made artwork slandering these women. He joined several alt right groups on his profile and he hated all liberals. He would also call people ''fucktard dumbass'', ''retard'' or ''creep'' constantly, in all caps as well. It was extremely obnoxious.

 I never copy paste spammed anywhere but I brought up the pictures he made in a post reply to the thread he essentially hijacked (he then tried to cover his tracks by deleting the anti semetic comments he made) and I got a private message from the site admin about how this neo nazi anti vax guy was concerned about my behaviour and if I do it again I will be suspended.
