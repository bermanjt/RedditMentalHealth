2,"Or at least, I want my world to end. I am tired of being depressed, Im exhausted from work and earning peanuts, ive always been alone and self hating and at this point I have zero hope. I dream of not having to work anymore or having to somehow muster up energy to continue living. 

I want a ww3, or an economic collapse or a terrorist attack to kill me or being conscripted or being put in prison or just anything really where I no longer have to live my shameful life. I hate existence, i hate living, its bullshit. I want to just become some outlaw robbing trains in the 1800s or something. Most of all I just want thisnto be over",05Nov2019,1
3,"I don't even know if I'm believing what I write, that's the most fucked up part. I can't tell if i've made it all up or if I truly feel this way. It's plagued me for years now. 

I was an accident, unplanned. Mom quit highschool at 17, got a home with my dad. 19. Mom and dad both got all their schooling done online when I was probably 5. I grew up in a ghetto area of my town, spent all day on the computer. I graduated from MiniClip and Newgrounds, found places like reddit, and 4chan, Bestgore, and Pornhub, I lived and still live on the internet. Fat in school, always the ""funny"" friend, sounds pretty dumb it sounds like i'm quoting some incel board bullshit. I have pretty much every kink in the book, since I was probably 10 or so. I masturbated for three years before I could even cum. I fell in with the townies and scumbags in my hometown at around 13/14. All I did was spend all my time in traps or greaseball apartment complexes smoking cigarettes with 9 year olds to people in their mid-twenties. Home fucking sucked after that, mom and dad split a few years back so I lived with my mom. She was a drunk. Never abusive physically. I like to believe that she was manipulative and emotionally abusive but to tell the truth I don't even fucking know. I did engineering in HS, held an intern position at the local refinery for 2 years but eh, never put my best effort, never in my life have I fully dedicated to anything other than the pursuit of pussy. By this time it was 2017 and I was just playing runescape in my cubicle, fixing drawings that I didn't really have to fix too well, because someone else would circle them and send it back to me to fix again. I don't have any hobbies, I've consistently failed at everything i've done besides driving or being able to get up and go to college classes. Nothing except my girlfriend has meaning or is worthwhile. I hate people and don't really like my roommates. Even on the surface I may interact and pal with them but I truly wouldn't care if I disappeared because it doesn't matter. They certainly wouldn't care. My parents are the only reason I can't die, they'd do something crazy, the both of them. I'm also 2 years into college so yeah that whole debt thing would essentially kill them too. 

I guess i'm writing this because I feel like TV static. All i've ever felt was numbing static. I get chills when I imagine the symphony of pink mist and viscera my head would make upon the ceiling. I usually snap out of it by then because it scares me. People have told me to get help, but I only went to counseling for a week, and even with his advice as soon as I left the room it was gone. It didn't help because I don't know if anything can. I am an accident, I feel like an alien. I don't think I was ever made for this world and truly I've never fit in. Still don't. I don't know if i'm depressed, I'd like to say I am or I was but honestly I don't fucking know, what if I made it up? what if i've manufactured every single fucking problem I've ever had. I am a glutton. I would die on the sofa because i'm too lazy to get to the store. I have no drive for ambition, my goals are meager, I can't get motivated to do anything unless it's for my girlfriend, i'd drive 4 hours in the rain to watch her play basketball, but can't set aside 4 hours to study. I spend all my time learning useless shit on Youtube. Home life sucks but eh that's life. Cards I was delt. I am a ghost, or maybe I was never meant to take part in this life, rather I was meant to simply observe. I feel like TV static. and I always have. Help me? I'd say that, but here's the thing, can you help someone that isn't sick? doesn't need help? Who just can't stop doing it to themselves? 
Had a girlfriend at 16/17 spent all my money and time on her. She was emotionally abusive too, manipulative and evil, but she has many exes, why are they all fine but it's me who ""thinks"" he's totally fucked up by her? That's the problem, I always ""think"" I am things, I ""think"" I might be depressed, I ""think"" I have an eating disorder, I ""think"" I have mommy issues. 
Living is the hard part. Dying is guranteed.

I have shitty tattoos my mother disapproves of, my only true passion is lying I guess, because I don't know whether I'm lying or not :) What if everything i've just wrote was ""poor-me"" ""pity-me"" bullshit. Whatever. It's not like I was supposed to be here anyways. I like listening to music. I tried to rap, even put out a song, but it's not me, and that shit is so played out. I spend any time I can with earbuds in, I only listen to my niche artists that now I don't even fucking know because some of them aren't niche anymore, and the rot of the community and content is painful to watch. The rot of it all is painful to watch. I'm watching myself waste away college, I didn't even think I'd make it to here. I figured i'd drop out of HS and live amongst the filth. Now I'm sitting in my on campus apartment and just wondering if I should even be posting this. Maybe someone will think i'm crazy and put me on med after med after med. Fuck this sounds like a manifesto. I just can't take the stress of dealing anymore, ""I'm so drained"" no I chose to be drained, I sit around. I drain myself to say I am drained, or do I? I don't fucking know. I can't even figure out what the fuck I want to eat, so I just don't. Doesn't stop me from getting high every night and munching away at 6 entrees only to wake up and go ""fuck I have an eating problem, I might be becoming anorexic"" oh haha wait, no you just /want the attention of being anorexic/ //YOU COULD EAT IF YOU wANTED TO// I just don't want to. I don't want to participate in this world why is it so fucking hard to become NOTHING. I quit social media, I disconnected from anyone that didn't make an effort to talk to me. I have no drive to do anything. Keeping people around simply requires energy.



What the fuck is wrong with me? The most blissful place I can think of is rotting in the forest, maybe under a big pine. The stags and doe cross my path, the coyotes, bears, they all pick at my flesh, soon I am nothing but bones, rags, and Doc Martin boots. lying in the leaf litter. I am the litter. The refuse that for some reason you can't throw out, I leech and consume, I leave people emotionally exhausted, I don't tend to enjoy them either. The worst part? I'm fucking privledged, there are people killing to be in my position. If I could poof my existence from the universe and replace myself with someone who was meant to be here, I would not hesitate.

The only thing I actively seek is relief from this constant torment, you cannot understand how confusing and horrible it is to not know if you're truly doing it to yourself.",05Nov2019,0
4,"I feel nothing in my life is working the way it should.

I have a family that doesn't love me, I am forced to go to a college I am not interesed in, losing quite a bit of my friends because I have to study all the time, which is a pain in the ass because everything is so boring, while the friends I have left are moving someplace else or rather spend time with other people. And even though I'm busting my ass off, my results aren't that good, since I've failed a few classes. 
None of my relationships are working out and I am hardly ever going out of my apartment.

And the worst of all is the fact I am not encouraged to follow my dreams, although I try to chase them, but I am restricted with obligations that my family put in front of me. The hope that I will be able to do it is all I have. 
I am so sad. And to top it all, today I managed to spill some juice on my laptop and now my keyboard, which I purchased literally 2 weeks ago, is fucking malfunctioning.

I have honestly had fucking enough. I hate every day more than the last one and I just want out of it all. Thankfully, I'm not suicidal or anything, but given the current progress of my mental state, I honestly see myself become suicidal. Why is happiness so hard to achieve? It was literally easier to me to overcome the bullying I faced both in primary school and in highschool. Now I see no way out... 

The only two things I want in life are happiness and freedom. Why do I get the feeling the more I try, the farther away I am? 
Is being satisfied with who I am really that much to ask?",05Nov2019,1
5,"I'm 23. I always think up to date with music trends but I just realised there are a lot of new artists I've never heard of or never listen to. I've tried to listening to the new songs, and I am starting to think almost all of them suck. Oh dear, I think I am getting older. Not expecting this to happen so quickly.",05Nov2019,3

7,"the feelings hit me all at once: i fucking like this chick. 

She’s so easy to talk to and even when i have my awkward moments she laughs it off and goes along with it. It’s been a hot minute since i’ve genuinely been into a girl but I really connect with her and feelings are stupid time to not rush in to things like ive stupidly done before. I feel great wish me luck!",05Nov2019,13
8,"I’m pretty sure my parents about to cut me off and I’m not sure that to do. I am very dependent on them and growing up I was pretty sheltered. They have always made sure my siblings and I always relied on them for most things. The worst part about it is, I have not done anything to warrant this treatment. Or at least anything major.

REASON FOR CUTTING ME OFF: So I’m currently dating someone outside of my culture. I’m African American and he identifies as Black.  We have been dating for almost 3 years and we know that we want to get married in the future. But my parents are very controlling and do not approve of our relationship and believe that I should marry someone within my own culture, and that I’m throwing away my culture  by doing this. 

I am a current masters student looking to become a physical therapist in the future (currently applying) Right now in order to pay for most of what I have I use loans (not sure the exact names). So I pay for my rent/utilities, gas for my car, my food, and any miscellaneous things. Right now my parents pay for my car insurance (I’m on their insurance), my health insurance, and my phone bill. Here and there they may help me out with a few other things but this year I tried to take on more just for this reason because I felt like this situation was on the horizon. I have a job at school, two actually. But they pay maybe 900 a month combined. I don’t feel like it will be enough to continue my education or even live on my own. And finance other parts of life. 

Now I realize that other people in life are homeless and there are other worse off situations. But I have always tried to listen to my parents, did my best I’m school, got my bachelors degree, never did drugs, etc. and somehow this is happening and I’m left feeling very hopeless. I already deal with severe anxiety which I have never really been able to see a professional about to accurately diagnose due to my parents disbelief in mental health and illnesses. And I feel like my life is basically falling a part and I have not learned coping mechanisms to deal with things like this, frankly I’m feeling very suicidal. So, if anyone has any advice or ways to be prepared for this situation mentally and tangibly....please let me know.",05Nov2019,1

10,"So, I'm 19 yo male from Poland. My life was reasonably shitty up until this point but whatever, I struggled with minor depression and anxiety on top of a really low self esteem. I was in a relationship for the last 3,5 years with a lovely girl, I really loved her and tried my best for her (after a heated argument i even seeked a help of a therapist to make sure nothing like that ever happens again). This year however, I slowly started to see some problems with our little relationship, mainly i saw how manipulative and selfish she was. Mind you, she was really good and really nice... sometimes, thing is she has clinical depression and Bipolar disorder, so she could be the best girl one time, and my worst nightmare the next. I brought some issues a couple times fairly early into our relationship, then those couple times turned to almost weekly talk about issues that we have with each other. Then it became a daily thing as she became more demanding and more unresponsive. At this point we were living together so stuff that she did was more and more obvious and I just snapped. I broke up with her and she decided that she is going to get me back by insulting me and wishing that I will forever blame myself for everything she is doing to herself, nice. I don't know what i can do now, I really miss her and I am positive that if she got the professional help she needs, she would be the best person on earth, but she just refuses to get it and says that she will get it eventually. I'm too depressed and hurt to do anything, I haven't been to college for a week and it's currently 2:30 a.m. and I don't go to sleep because everything hurts and I just want something that I can hold on to, preferably someone but at this point it's whatever. I think I need to talk to someone",05Nov2019,1

12,"It’s been about a week and a half and it felt like I was doing well, I threw myself at my work and came forward to my friends how depressed this whole thing made me. Thanks to their support I was doing very well and she hardly crossed my mind at all. Then she decided to make contact with me..and all of a sudden it’s like the resentment and anger never went away, she cheated on me with an ex and took a week to tell me about it. I was looking for any excuses not to contact her and yell like a maniac. It’s just not fair how she gets to live in happy (even if temporary) bliss with her BF and I’m stuck here struggling to keep it together. I have so many things I wanna say to them, but I know it’s better to just try and move on. My one thing keeping me moving forward is trying to improve myself by hitting the gym, getting a new job etc.",05Nov2019,2
13,"I'm 24, have worked full time 55+ hours per week for the last 5-6 years since graduating high school. Even though I work at lot, I don't personally have anything against my bosses and the company owner, I just dislike working for other people. I do photography on the side as that's what I would love to do full-time self employed. Until then, I work for in a smaller company of 20 people as a website admin and support agent. I am at the point I despise going into the office Monday - Friday. 

Does anyone have advice for growing my side hobby/gig/job so I can eventually run my own business. Suggestions for shrugging the dread I have of going into the office on weekdays?",05Nov2019,1
15,"So before our lunch period ended I managed to bring myself to ask her if she wanted to go out with me. I honestly didn’t expect myself to and was super on the spot during the moment. She didn’t laugh at me, she didn’t scold me, she didn’t even say: “how do I say this?” She was super honest and just said, ”I would say yes but I’m already dating someone.” 

I wasn’t **at all** discouraged by this to be completely honest. It got rid of the stress of ’when will it happen?’ or ‘should I do it now?’. And it‘s not like we couldn’t make eye contact afterwards. We’re still good friends and she still laughs and has fun with me. She later said, “I figured you were kinda into me but...yeah”

And hey, if it ever comes down to it. If her other relationship doesn’t work out or she just isn’t interested, she can still ask me out later XD

Honestly, I’m happy, sad, confused, and relieved all at the same time. I seriously haven’t ever asked a girl out in my life so this is a huge step up for me. Thanks to everyone who helped me out!!",05Nov2019,2
16,"Like I said, I’ve never really had an urge to self-harm before through years of anxiety, depression and self-resentment. But lately I’ve suddenly found myself getting these feelings. It’s like a deep underlying tension that turns into something almost like an itch, but instead of scratching it, I want to reach for something sharp and inflict pain upon myself. I’m currently in the last few weeks of a training programme and I took today off having told HR that I wasn’t in a great place at the moment. But I plan on returning to work tomorrow. These feelings are new, and they’re kinda scary. I want to say I won’t actually do anything, but mental health issues don’t exactly follow a schedule. This really sucks.",05Nov2019,2
17,"I've been sobbing a straight half hour and I'm all over the place, so if you read this -- bear with me.

What it comes down to is, well, I'm about to get trapped in our unforgiving prison system.

April of 2018, I had one of the worst days of my life and I made the most terrible decision to escape from my woes and all of my reality and everyone in it. I made it to work with a handle of Captain Morgan on the floor of the passenger side. I'll never forgive myself for such irresponsibility, but I drank. And when I was done with half the bottle, clocked out from work, I sat in the parking lot and drank some more. 

It's still winter in the Midwest, it was freezing and I was miserable and alone in my head and thinking I was alone in this world so I tried to drive home. I didn't make it far. Straight into a snowbank, I've never been so relieved to wreck my own car rather than someone else's -- or worse, a life.

Several days spent in jail, $1,000 shelled out to bail, a couple hundred to the guys that towed my car, I'm left to find a lawyer because my slightly-above-minimum wage job is too much.

My lawyer is $3,500 and my reinstatement fee is $680. It's my first offense ever, and in the middle of the process, I've moved from Minnesota to North Dakota. I plead guilty, and my charges are reduced to a gross misdemeanor. $1,090 for a fee, and 16 hours of community service.

No problem, I can budget and dig my way out. I'm feeling pretty confident. Next weekend is community service. I'm back on track and caught up on bills from having to provide gas money an hour to and from to take care of court several times over.

Tonight, I get a notice from ND's DoT saying I am suspended from driving -- I don't have a license, just a state ID, mind you -- due to my conviction. I need to reinstate. Again. I have some form to complete and treatment to do and I'll likely even need another lawyer if I opt for a hearing.

I haven't even paid off my the *first* lawyer.. or reinstated in the first state.. Everyone is telling me to save up, budget out, *you can do it!* There's no fucking way. I fuck up *one* time, and somehow I've sealed my fate to a sentence. I've come to terms with making my mistake and paying back for it, but this? This is brutal, and unfair, and it takes one tiny mistake on any driver's part to get me caught and put me away.

*So don't drive?* Cool idea, but public transportation isn't really a financially viable option if I have all this to pay up. And none of my coworkers are that close by me.

It just.. this all sucks. I know I fucked up pretty bad. But this letter just ruined any possibility I may have had getting back on track with my life, there's a strong possibility I go away before ever catching up. And I'm just desolate, a whole future just went down the drain with all that fucking alcohol.

.... These are only a few of the many things that I get when trying to speak out about my depression. Living in a society where men can’t talk about their feelings, being told to be a man about it, and grow a pair. Ten plus years of this torment and I’m now 26. After using alcohol as a crutch, I’ve merely dug my hole deeper. Getting in trouble with the law, losing jobs, friendships and relationships... It all just came crashing down like dominoes. I live in my aunts basement. I work a dead end slave labor job, barely enough to pay my rent and phone bill while letting my past financial responsibilities go to collections. My brother who is also an alcoholic, who I have been close to my entire life, beat the shit out of me when one of our drunken nights went south. I’ve had to drop him from my life. My parents who tend to six adopted kids have no time for my pathetic excuse of a life because they actually have their shit together and don’t want the burden of a grown up son who can’t take care of himself. I’m too big of a coward to let go. I can’t bring myself to take a bottle of pain pills, jump from that overpass that always crosses my mind, or simply drive off of a cliff. I’m stuck.

Throughout much of my late teens and my 20's, I've used Tinder to meet girls. I am proud of myself for finally getting away from it for once and meeting someone in a natural way. 

We really connected out of nowhere. No bio to read, no swiping through edited photos, just natural coversation. 

I am going to try and use tinder less and less. Try and put myself out there and meet others in a natural way. Tinder may be an ego booster at times, but you already know what you're getting with it. You don't with casual conversation, and that's where I think the real, long lasting connections are made.

So I’m very curious about how many people wish they were born a different race, especially white people born in a predominately white environment or even white people who live as minorities. As I’ve notice lately that In certain cultures it’s starting to beconsidered “cool” to hate white people, and I’m interested to see how much of an effect this has had on the populous

I’m also interested to here the opinions of non white people and how often they wake up and think that their lives would be easier if they were another race and why

It was pretty innocent and not a huge deal. So as YouTube does, it gave me a couple more Blue Collar Logic videos. I thought the guy had some points about tattoos so why not watch a couple more? I have been watching Blue Collar Logic on and off for maybe 6 months now and I have come to a final conclusion in light of recent events surrounding impeachment news.

Blue Collar Logic is a blatant conservative propaganda channel with hordes of foaming at the mouth conservatives rallying in the comments.

I watched a recent video and thought about how much actual information was in that video that could be misleading. After some quick Googles, wikis, and article readings, it became clear that the narrative provided by Blue Collar Logic is a stretch at best. Once you strip the video of it's shaky narrative, you're really left with ""the Democrats want this"" and ""the Democrats want to take that"" and ""what the left doesn't understand"" it's all rhetoric used to take easily influenced people and make them more likely to feel wronged by the left. The hordes in the comments prove it.

I can’t bring myself to try in school and I doubt I’ll go to university or college so I don’t know why I’m in the more advanced courses but I feel like I need to, just so I can be viewed as the same person I am now 
With all this in mind and also my choice as a Christian to recently live my life with God in mind and strengthen my faith I thought it would be a good idea to go to bible college
Both my parents are very religious but not in the crazy kind of way they actually read the bible and study it and live their lives with it as an instruction manual so I thought they’d be very proud when I told them I wanted to go to bible college but their response was laughter 

I don’t know if it was my tone or just that the conversation was about what I’m planning on doing with my life and why I’m skipping classes and what not 
It also might just be me being an ignorant teen but when I told them I wanted to go to bible college and my dad laughed I actually went to my room and cried I thought that they’d be extremely proud of me for this choice but at the time it didn’t seem like it

So while I lay there crying my mom knocks on the door so I obviously say “GO AWAY!” But she came in anyway and basically said how they didn’t mean to upset me and if I really want to go to bible college then I should go ahead and do so. Also my dad just came in while I was typing this and said how he thought I was joking and thought I was being sarcastic because he didn’t think I was thinking about my faith they also both asked if there was something more going on which I said no but I’m all honesty idk if there’s anything more going on but if there was I probably wouldn’t tell my parents and I don’t why I wish I could just talk to them but I can’t bring myself to casually talk to them",05Nov2019,1

38,"hi everyone (please read full text before commenting)

I am a 18yo girl. I just wanted to get another males perspective on this as I’m having trouble making one decision. 

Long story short, I have decided to start cam girling/selling my own content after months of preparation and very deep consideration. I also have a long term partner who is willing to help and support me. I have everything together, just need to decide if I post the content including my face or not... 

I’ve always new I wanted to try the sex industry as an adult since I was 12 (had an extremely messed up/abusive childhood) but I know whole heartedly this is something I’m doing on my own terms. I know I’ll regret not giving at least something a go when I’m older. I had been thinking about seriously starting this journey since I was 17, I’m almost 19 now. 

My dilemma is, my parents are crazy Asians so if they ever found out I would be cut off from any contact with my siblings (I’m the oldest. I have 4 siblings 16, 10, 3, 1yrs old). I also currently live with my partners family so I risk not having a roof over my head. 

Which is why I had come to the conclusion to not show my whole face in any of my content (for reference type in NoFaceGirl on the hub)
However, half of me believes if I’m going to do this, I may as well go all out right? And in my experience watching porn I do like seeing the girls face and her facial expressions - fake or not. In my own research it seems the majority says “if you’re a hot girl make the most of it while you’re young” which I agree with, I just know some people can be assholes and I don’t want to be harassed at university or in public, Yknow?

What are your thoughts guys?? :)


Side note: I honestly like creating content and have experience in the modelling industry for a few years so I’m not camera shy. I wanted to try this path to hopefully alleviate some financial stress and set up my future. And as a straight female I have no qualms to having sex with my partner, camera present or not. He is also fully supportive on whether I choose to show my face or not. I also have a job and two bachelors im studying for with precise career goals so no this isn’t a “oh I’ll just be a stripper” kind of thing.",05Nov2019,4
39,"I’m 25F and I still find myself wishing I had a passionate and embracing love like the rom coms. The love where the guy wants to constantly protect you, prove his love for you, and does such sweet gestures. 
We are constantly fed this idealistic vision of love and it’s fucking me up for the real world!! 

I grew up an only child and not the best relationship with my dad. I had a very troubled past. The ideal scenario of any frickin love movie lmao. I’ve always wanted a guy to come “save me” and be my “Prince Charming”. 

I want love letters, to be wooed and taken on spontaneous and meaningful dates, to be pulled close if I try to angrily walk away, to just feel like someone wants to protect me. To feel that “look”. 
I want someone to look in my eyes like I’m their whole world. That fucking LOOK. You know that look!!!

I don’t think I’ve ever had this type of relationship and I’m really wondering if it exists?

I realize I sound really fucking stupid and immature... but god, I want that type of passionate love.
Is it out there? 
I can’t help but find myself envious of novels, movies, tv shows, etc... it had to stem from where right? This idea of love has to actually exist somehow.

So essentially this semester I worked full time and volunteered to teach children in an after school program. But my grades took the brunt of those circumstances. I'll be lucky if I pass 3 of my 4 classes. At this point I'm very certain I'm going to fail math for the second time..

For example, I love watching movies and learning about the deeper meaning of them, but I struggle to come to these realizations on my own.

53,"For the past 10ish months I’ve liked this guy (who I recently started dating) and he used to have a crush on this insanely attractive girl who’s way better looking than me, for about a year and a half, until getting to know me after our first few months of friendship. I’m obsessed with the way she looks. I still think my boyfriend likes her, even though it’s obvious he doesn’t. I just want to look like her. I’ve been told many times that I’m not nearly as good looking as her, and I agree. I get that personality is more important than looks and I’ve heard she’s boring compared to me, but I don’t care. Personality is something that can be changed, not appearance. I don’t hate her at all because of her good looks, it’s more so “Wow. I really, really wish I could look like that because I feel so incredibly ugly and insecure.” Every time I see her I want to die inside because I get reminded of how disgusting and unattractive I am in comparison to her. Many of the times I’ve ever been upset since I met my boyfriend has been (indirectly) because of her. It’s not her fault, she hasn’t done anything to me personally. It’s literally just because I find her so beautiful that I’m upset that I don’t look like that. I’ve never talked to her in my life. It’s a problem I have within myself and I know that. I don’t know why I am so obsessed with this one chick, however. Is it simply because I hate myself?? I don’t understand, because it’s not that a big of a deal yet my brain makes it out to be one that I cry all the time over it. I think it’s important to note that I have body dysmorphic disorder, but never in my life have I been so obsessed with wanting to look like someone.

62,"Sometimes being an empath can be totally draining. 

I prefer to keep my energy intact so I came up with a method (2 parts) that works (for me). 

1.) Automatically care for people without having to get to know them. This works (for me) because no matter if they’re broken and still mean I already decided that I care for them so I know that I’ve made the best choice moving forward, so no matter their attitude I still feel joy in their presence. 

2.) Firmly decide to install love into the content of the conversation. If someone is telling me a sad story or sat situation that they’re facing, I listen thoroughly and then gush plausible positive outcomes and inspiration onto the vibrations of our communication and their aura. 
This way they’re not focused on the negative, rather the experience. Sometimes people want to vent (only) and sometimes people want advice or direction. If the advice or direction is something that causes empathy to kick into overdrive then STOP! Evaluate if you can manage that type of drainage and if you cannot then you need to let them know that you care, but do not particularly have the answers they are looking for. 

Remember that if you’re not whole and intact yourself how the heck are you going to be able to provide sound advice or direction?

It’s hard being empathetic, especially if you’re deep in tune with energy and vibrations because you ALWAYS want to fix EVERYTHING. It’s not your job to break your energy levels down to a point where you are drained. 

We have to (or should want to) build ourselves up and strengthen our mind and spirit before attempting to heal the world. 

I only mean well in this post. I’m not saying turn your back on anyone. Rather, pick and choose the best course of actions to help others as well as protect yourself.

I don't really like me and I am barely above average, 2). I feel like comparison is inevitable so it's kind of hard not to, 3).

65,"

In university I was involved with what is known as the exgay/conversion therapy movement. That's probably a whole confession in itself.

The movement consisted of 3-4 Christian guys in this group I met through church. There were some girls but for some reason they weren't invited to the trip.

The older head guy (PJ) was nice, charming and good looking, but a fairly uncanny valley humanbot. I went to a few meetings and he tells me they’re going camping in the lakes and I should come it will be fun and good for masculine bonding.

At this point, I say I don’t know. I like drinking beer and smoking and being indoors and not bonding but I’m keeping this quiet from them because I want to fit in on some level.

I also want my SSA cured and idgaf what I have to do. If ‘camping’ is the cure then sure. I mean, I’ve been camping before I used to live in a caravan.

So me and these three other men head out with tent and sleeping bags and stay on a campsite. We get up WAY too early and we go and sit in the woods and hug each other and talk about Jesus. Feels wholesome.

We see some waterfalls and yes we all share a tent and I don’t sleep because I do still get the feeling these guys I don’t exactly know are going to bumfk me and leave my body out there. It was mainly too boring and stressful for me though.

So I brought a pot brownie, and it kicked in hard during a game of pool we were playing at the pub (4 orange juices) and when I walked back I started freaking out.

I was terrified. There's no need to go into what was scaring me as it was a mixture of bats, logs and mind reading. I remember trying to pee and it going everywhere. Nonesense really.

I also remember I held another guys hand. This was probably within the rules of exgay camping, but not exactly encouraged.

Then PJ holding me and reassuring me that Jesus loved me and I was having a Holy Spirit moment.

Time was going a bit slowly and I thought he was reading my mind and he looked extra creepy in the eyes.

But nothing really happened other than that and the next day no one said anything. We did some praying and hugging and I just cringed my way through it. PJ seemed happy and like he'd done something to cause a revelation in me. The others might have suspected I was just high. The guy I held hands with asked me for platonic coffee when we got back but I declined. I forgot about that.

Yes we had sausages and I was thinking, does no one think this is a little bit ridiculous? and I don’t think they did.

It's a highly technical job that requires lots of deflecting arguments, studying specifications and  climbing the ladder means lots of people management which I don't enjoy. Instead, I feel like I might do better in careers such as teaching, crisis response or nursing. Based on my personality (below), what other career options should I consider exploring?

I am relatively quiet. I enjoy working alone or in small groups (10 or less), but tend to get drowned out in larger groups. I don't enjoy leading all the time, but am good at it if I must. I am smart, and am a very good ""beta"" to a leader because I am able to catch where they slip, but I require moderate independence to thrive. During conversations, I am not fast-thinking with my replies, but usually come up with well thought answers given some time.

I enjoy working in an environment where my role can change from day to day. I am caring, considerate and patient and enjoy teaching people new things. I also love learning new skills and am willing to devote long periods of time to learning, but once I master something, I put it down and start looking for a next new thing to learn. My work style consists of strong intermittent bursts of energy rather than consistency. I also enjoy taking moderate physical risks, being outdoors, and don't mind getting my hands dirty.

79,"## A Brief Statement

The following is my attempt to inform newly accepted students about the Georgia Tech OMSA program before they start. It contains things I wish I knew before I began the program.


## The Pros: What you can expect from the GT OMSA Program


- **Name Recognition:** Georgia Tech is a name that carries high prestige in multiple fields including: finance, technology, engineering. If you complete the program, it will somewhat improve your resume.


- **edX Platform:** Most of the content will be on edX, so it is easy to access.


-**Efficiency:** If you already know the materiel before you start, you can efficiently complete the program. I would recommend this program for people that have *significant* experience programming in multiple languages, performing large scale data analysis, and are *highly* familiar with data cleaning and processing techniques. If you have already working in a data science role for a few years, and have worked with python and R regularly in a professional capacity, you can probably complete this program efficiently.



## The Cons: What you can also expect from the GT OMSA Program


The Georgia Tech online program is not in the business of teaching. What I mean by that is this: you are going to be responsible for learning the materiel on your own, mostly through other sources such as separate edX or Coursera classes, Amazon book purchases, or Google searches. The lessons are few and very short, and do not cover the tested topics directly. If you do not already know how to do something, it is highly unlikely you will learn it during the program.


As an example, these are the recent midterm scores from a CSE-6040 midterm:


Grade | % of Students
:-: | :-:
A | 57%
B | 5%
C | 10%
D | 8%
F | 20%


An Expected Distribution

Grade | % of Students
:-: | :-:
A | 20%
B | 40%
C | 20%
D | 15%
F | 5%



These are the students that have completed the exam a couple days before it was due. Notice the bi-modal distribution in the GT class. Normally, you'd expect grades to be normally distributed around the B to B+ area. This would be indicative of a normal program, for which students were taught material and some naturally performed better than others. Here we have a large chunk of students with A's, and another large group failing. Keep in mind that these are smart and motivated people; this is a difficult program to get in to. In addition, they had 36 hours and full access to internet resources and all class materiel (including videos). My speculative explanation for this is the first group (the A's) came into the program already having substantial experience with the material, while the latter group was hoping to learn that material from the classes and instructors.


In this subreddit, I often hear people say ""this program is hard and isn't for everyone"". However, it is my experience that what makes this program hard is more a lack of effort by GT than anything else. In a given week, there are about 10-15 minutes of lesson videos, and then your homework assignment. For those assignments, most people spend 2-4 hours per week working. Ultimately, the assignments can be completed with a few lines of code. And if you are well trained, could be completed in 30-45 minutes. The substantial amount of time people spend on projects is not working, but rather educating themselves. I can't recommend a program where you spend 2 hours Googling stuff for every 10 minutes of class.

For comparison, I'm currently also in another MS program (online) at a BIG10 university and the instruction quality is night and day different. We have 60-75 minutes of online class lectures (recordings) per week. Our projects are usually building models that I can immediately apply outside of class.

## In Summary
TL;DR : If you already know the material that is going to be taught and have *significant* experience working as a technical data analyst or data scientist, this program will add prestige to your resume. Think of it more as a *certification*.

If you do not have 3-5 years of programming experience (specializing in Python, R, Algorithm Design, and working with large data sets), you are not going to succeed in this program. You are not going to be *taught* these things. It is also unlikely you will pass the classes. If your goal is to learn a new skill set, you are much better off in another online program. Some hypothetical better options are below:

80,"This is my first post and maybe I need some advice, maybe I just need to vent. I work in property management and we just recently got some new tenants. The husband is kind of famous, and he's kind of a major monster.

To explain a little something about property management, before a new person moves in you walk the property, figure out whats wrong with the place and if it needs fixing you fix it. So the property was walked pictures were taken and the property was in decent condition apart from some paint spots and a light that needed a new battery (which we replaced) the place was in great condition.

They move in and instantly everything is wrong; lights aren't working right, the fridge doesn't work, the washer and dryer don't work, the windows aren't closing right. Everything is just wrong with the place. The system we use for our company allows us to send text messages to the tenant, and when I come into work I have a barrage of texts, saying why aren't we getting any compensation, why aren't you apologizing, and if we don't respond withing 5 minutes he will send a question mark.

I really just do not know how to deal with this human being, he's acting entitled and he's acting like he is the only tenant that is having some sort of issue. Our company also does not rent places out unless they are in good standing.  Does anyone have any advice or suggestions on how to deal with this situation, I feel like I'm sacrificing my own sanity and this guy is just a bully due to his status.",05Nov2019,1

“Aww shit, is that a CD player??” He exclaimed

“Well yeah. Why, what’s up?”

“I’ll be right back!”

He comes back with a massive cd case that was all too familiar and says, “you ready for a road trip circa 1999?”

He pops in *Americana* by The Offspring and *Lets do it for Johnny!!* by Bowling for Soup and I’m immediately whisked away. These albums are very much the soundtrack to my generic teenage rebellion. I remember the Alien Ant farm and Gwar posters on my childhood walls. Yelling at my parents for telling me to turn my music down. My black nail polish I look back on in fond disgust.

So I had no idea where to post this (didn't wanna put it in the trans reddit because I'm cis), so major apologies if ya'll don't want it here -- I can take it down. Just joined Reddit specifically to ask this, as well.

Right, so I'm a cis female with body confidence issues. I have a pretty large bust, and it's always bothered me, but since starting college, it's bothering me more and more.

Are there any cis females out there who bind, and can share their experiences? I've looked into it, but the dumb thing is that I don't know if I'm ""allowed"" to bind as someone who isn't trans.

90,"Since the death of my grandfather one of my familial assignments has been to help with clearing out and selling his house. The family had taken the mementos they've wanted during the funeral weekend. Now it's all ""junk"" left besides the furniture being left behind for the new owners. On my days off that's how I've spent the majority of my life.

It's like a constantly emotional archaeological dig where nothing is really preserves and most of it will get donated or thrown out. After a few weekends I'm still not out of the basement. 

My grandmother somehow amassed an amount of wrapping paper and gift tags to last until the apocalypse. Hell, probably through the rebuilding of society as well. 

Then there's all the bowling trophies. It seems my grandfather bowled very successfully in the same league for forty five years. All these faded gaudy tokens to his bowling prowess are destined for the landfill. A cheap wood and plastic legacy now left to rot. All the blood, sweat, and time simply to be written off by history.

Now let's forget about the Barbie dolls. There were a half dozen officially branded carrying cases full of dolls and clothes. A collection that was the height of haute couture in the sixties. The toys were very ""loved"" by my mother and her sisters, probably my one cousin as well to a lesser extent. It's all on the way to the dump now.

All these feelings and memories bound up in simple objects just thrown off so the building can get sold off to the highest bidder.

Rationally I know this is simply how it goes. It all makes sense in a cold logical way that keeps the world moving. The trouble is the emotional memories of these things keeps creeping up to kick me in the head. If I wasn't so burned out from work when I'm doing all this I'd probably I start crying every twenty minutes remembering my time in this house.

The worst part is when I've had to be in the house when the realtor showed it. So far that's only been a few times, but I hate it. I'm sure these people are lovely, but I want to chase them off with hateful fury. They want a nice three bedroom in a good school district not far from work and play. I get it, but I hate them all the same. 

Oh the kitchen is too small? It wasn't too small for my grandmother to host some of the most amazing family events in my life!

Not sure about the dining room? Well I'm pretty sure you're a piece of shit who can't appreciate family time together.

Want to knock down the back wall of the house and expand? I hope you go bankrupt from a shitty contractor.

Yeah, it all feels like a complete mess for me. I try to be as nice and understanding as possible, but I hate it. I'm not sure if I'm in the anger or negotiation part of the grieving process. Can they stack up?

I don't know. I'm really tired and I've finally heard back from the realtor for the next showing.

So to wrap this up.....I don't know. I can't think of anything half clever right now.  I guess this is just a bit of a rant then?",05Nov2019,2

108,"Hey self, I [m,29] recently got back from seeing a girl I used to date in college. We dated for about a year and half in 2013-14. She is currently in med school and one of her rotations was in my town I’m June so we reconnected and have spent meaningful time together. I visited her again (new rotation) in July where she said she enjoyed being with me, but due to the nature of med school she didn’t feel like she could commit to anything, which I totally understand. I then just visited her again (yet another rotation) and this time I flew out to see her and then helped her pack her house and move to her current rotation spot. We had a blast together but did not discuss the future of ‘us’ whatsoever. I am back home today in quite a funk- I miss her, I enjoyed being her co-captain, helping her move, giving her massages and just being supportive as she transitions through all of these rotations. I would love nothing more to than too be in a committed relationship with her but don’t know if I should bring it up again... you know, dating culture in 2019. But I also wonder if there’s really a point to being official at this state in time? She’s likely going to be back in my state/area next summer so it seems possible we could have something.

111,"When I tell people what I’ve been through in the past they would always get shocked I’ve never been to a therapist. I guess at some point I thought because my family called me the most mentally stable and the one with the best hope for the future that going to see one would be giving into my negative side. Except when you try and work through something alone for 6 years it eats away at you.

After a few toxic relationships, cutting off my abusive parent, suicidal thoughts, and many break downs, I decided to seriously get some help. I went through my university to try and direct me.

I didn’t know Al-anon meetings were a thing but it seems exactly what I needed. Many of the traits that they use to describe children of alcoholics perfectly describe all the negative flaws I have of myself at the moment. I’m also spending time to find a long term therapist.

For my family, all this seems out of no where because I’ve gotten so good at pretending I was alright. But I lie to make it seem like my life is normal, so they can still believe in the girl they want me to be. Maybe I’ll open up to them about everything.

Yesterday I found out she's still seeing him when I noticed both her and my best friend took me off their close friends list on Instagram (i asked another friend if she had posted anything and there it was, his face).

Today at school (and I'm not proud of this but whatever) I went through my best friend's phone and saw they had been talking about me. So I kinda fell apart and started begging best friend to tell me the truth. She didn't, she lied to my face.
When I asked my other friend what happened, she denied anything happening (just said that things were a bit tense which I understand) and said that I should worry about myself and that they would always be there for me. I'm choosing to believe her because I cannot fathom losing them right now. If I do, I know I might do something crazy.

Right now, I hate my molester with every cell of my being. He destroyed me and is 100% manipulating my friend (he's 23, she's almost 17).

119,"I probably don't need advice but hey, if someone does have some, I'd appreciate it. I think it's a case of letting time do its thing again. And again. And again. I just need somewhere to stick my feelings on things. 

Everything is incredibly wrong. Everything feels incredibly horrible and I can't do anything about it. The biggest hole in my life right now is a breakdown of a relationship. Circa 10 months when it ended - with her ending it over not having the time because she's too focussed on her law degree, as well as her mental health playing havoc. I really really wish I could take this explanation at face value. She's never lied before or anything - and has no real reason to not tell me the truth about the breakup. But something feels off - very very off. Galavanting around a different country for two weeks when you've got so little time because of a law degree without a care almost seems like something's amiss. Either way - god fucking damn I miss her. 

I'm not the most attractive, nor the funniest, nor the smartest - but back then she actually saw something! Similar dark humour, similar mood. The only thing - and the explanation for a relationship flop - is my idiotic mental health. It's bad. I remember having pretty bad mood swings and racing thoughts last year. Literally, the only thing I could do is go to work and come home again, and that's it. Didn't want to go out, or face the world, or anything. I get it if this is the reason she broke up with me, because that must be hell, to have a boyfriend who wants to do absolutely nothing because his brain's being stupid over and over again. I just wish I had the truth behind the breakup if it isn't what's already been said. 

I'm so so close to messaging her and asking her if she's happy on how things turned out, and if she thinks it was a mistake. She isn't going to tell me what I want to hear, cos this isn't a dream. Haven't spoken in three weeks so I'm pretty sure she would have said something by now if she really did think it was a mistake.

And this brings me onto problem 2. When it comes to the whole dating scene, I don't really have much to bring. I live at home, with parents, because living here is ridiculously expensive. A civil servants salary, while good, isn't amazing - and I'd probably have to live further away from my office rather than stick it out at home. But that becomes an issue when dating, because **judgement**. Did I mention I'm also fairly short for a guy? Stuck at 5ft8 cos shitty genetics is really fucking great. As well as not exactly in the greatest shape? Thanks antidepressants for ruining my metabolism, and depression for turning me into an impulsive eater. 

And this is also another reason I'm scared of being alone after the breakup referenced above. It's hard to find someone who'll accept someone living at home, short, not exactly the smartest/funniest etc - PLUS comes with absolutely broken mental health. I've probably planned out my own death several times over and over, in meticulous detail. No one would want to deal with the fallout of changing over medication, or off days. 

And my mental health is now kicking me in the head, bringing me onto problem 3. It physically hurts. I'm out of shape because of a combination of antidepressants and not really going outside and depression impulses - and fearful of judgement at the gym. Plus I have no idea what I'm doing, and exhausted after work. It doesn't make for a good combination at all. I literally set foot in a gym for the first time ever a couple weeks ago, managed to get the flu and lost the motivation I built up going for the first time. My thoughts also race around without rhyme or reason - around a shitty situation with family, work being stressful, a distinct lack of friends and now a breakup. I have no idea why things can't go my way for once, who the hell have I pissed off to the point that I deserve a constant vicious cycle of having everything fuck up? 

My job is the only thing I'm proud of right now. Someone with fairly mediocre education (I went to the worst 'ivy league' UK equivalent), I got a place on a graduate scheme people try to get into for years and years, first time. Combine with extreme bitterness about how I could've done so much better, it still hurts. I've lost my work bitching buddy, the person who I'd end up commuting home with on the train, making jokes about my day and how great she was. 

While things do link back heavily to a relationship, and common wisdom tells me it'll take three months to break a habit and start feeling better - I don't want to feel better. I just want our inside jokes, stupid laughter and stuff back.

I think its mental health which is making this process a thousand times harder - I wish I was normal, not lonely and just not living between home and work.",05Nov2019,0

121,"For a long time i've been struggling to accept myself and i reflected that by rejecting one of my names, since i was a little kid everyone knows me or calls me by a certain name (let's say it's X) but since a graduated from high school and when i was about to go to the uni, i started to use my middle name (B) \[context note: i'm from colombia so two names are normal here, all of this happened when i was 15 yo, so yeah i was a bit immature for uni, i ended up not entering to uni after the graduation, i took one sabbatical year to study english and think about what i would like to do with my life, it's still a young age to get to uni but, it's the usual in COL entering the uni after graduating from h.s\].

So because i hated how i was at the time i thought making the people call me by my middle name it was a new start for a new and better version of me. that was 5 years ago and a lot things happened, since that day i felt like my life was even more miserable than before but i still didn't want that people called me by X, i was so delusional, i didn't want to be the person that i was before but i wasn't acknowledging that even if i hated that version of myself that was me, i didn't want to accept that even the fact that i hated me it was still me i don't know how to explain better this part srry. 

But for months i've been thinking about that fact and it hurts me to accept it but im doing it, that excuse that i put myself through those selection of names its pointless because know that i'm using a new name i feel like i shittier version of me, that new name shit was pointless because i was hating myself more that i ever did\[with deep depression and a strong anxiety\], to the point that i was even considering killing myself for a while. 

About 2 weeks ago i got to the point of actually doing something to fix myself or atleast improve my current situation, i realized that if i don't start doing something to help me i'm probably going to live with this horrible version of me and end up killing me at some point, \[i know that i need therapy but the help for mental help here it's not cheap and i'm not prepared to talk with my parent about this yet, my mother is a single mom so i think that would crushed her\], the things that i'm doing right now are : first start using my X name(because i figured out that the reason for not using it was pointless and i honestly like this name more than the other) i feel like it's the first step to bring back together myself and to start in the process of loving myself, and second is to stop watching porn(because for almost two year this addiction destroyed me so i'm not going to let it destroy me more than i'm already are), and third even if sounds cliche start doing some outsides hobbies that i like. 

All of this with the final goal of overcoming my depression and anxiety at some point and finally start enjoy my life not just surviving. I really need to get this out of my chest, thanks to everyone reading, and have a great day. If you would like to tell me something i'm going to be glad to answer you.",05Nov2019,1

123,"Missed an interview cause I thought it was central time but it was eastern, didn’t receive the calls but that’s not the point. The thing making me sad about it was that I’m out with friends and they were all really excited for me to do it. So I snuck away and was just going to chill somewhere and do it meet them after. I don’t have the heart to tell them I missed it so imma lie and say it went well. Theyll all be too drunk to be able to tell but damn. I’m just sad cuz really imma just sit on the toilet for another 10 minutes creating the lie.",05Nov2019,0

Finding people isn’t necessarily a problem, but holy shit I didn’t realize how not-ready I was for this again.

126,"It's pretty fuckin sad if this actually is a thing, after fighting for so many levels of equality we are just gonna throw age out the window? 

I understand : It is easy to blame the previous generation, and we love to blame others for everything. But for fucking real guys? Firstly, of course they used a lot of resources, there's a fuck ton of boomers, hence the term ""Baby Boomers"". After the war, people got to breeding to fill a massive vacancy in population.

Expecting the older generation to all know what they discovered and taught us is also ridiculous. All of the information we have now that is readily available to us was not available to them as children. Let's take everything you've been taught until you were 25, and now tell you it's all wrong, and see how well you can accept it! 

Like are we seriously that shitty, shortsighted of a generation? And we think somehow with our selfish, individualistic generation are going to be better?

I mean come on look at the children of millennials! Of any generation whose raised kids at the same time as cell phones and internet.

127,"man, this is really hard. has anybody here experienced stuff like that? long story here, TLDR at the end. 

**backstory**: I found this magazine brand run by a girl a few months back, on instagram. we got talking in the comments, then in the DMs and finally she invited me to a magazine party that she hosted. Before that I had never met her, but there was a tiny flirty vibe hanging around even when just messaging. 

From the first second I saw her (only the back of her head), I was kinda mesmerized. We instantly clicked on so many levels and after a few hours, when only a handful of her friends where left, we went on to a club and soon it was only the two of us left. The flirting got pretty serious, but I remembered her having a boyfriend. Told her im no homewrecker, if she wants to cheat on her boyfriend im not the guy for it. turns out, they are open and long distance and sometimes dont talk for weeks, so this is totally cool. we made out and danced the whole night until 6 in the morning, mixing really deep and vulnerable topics, that came so easily, with some real good kissing. 

we talk about relationships, and how hers has been going on for 3 years, while not being bad, it's a lot of work and that she has made way more sacrifices than he did. I didnt comment on that, not my place. anyway, we find out that we have SO much in common. how we grew up, what we want from life, where we would like to live, our education, background, humor. it felt like a very bad romantic movie, where the writers are trying to shoehorn romance. she literally said that she and I already have more in common than she and her BF. 

&amp;#x200B;

now, I hear you: this could just have been one night of love-drunkenness. we were aware of that and literally said fuck it, we are going to put this to a test. that night happened two months ago, we've since talked daily and decided to meet up in a city neither of us live in. I had mixed feelings since I dont wanna be an affair, but she assured me that this was fine within her open relationship. 

we met up a week ago and spent 3 days together, which itself is kind of a whack idea, but just like you'd imagine: everything worked out perfectly, it's almost cheesy. slept together, ate together, went to museums together, talked until 4 am. had that awkward talk about what this could become with her BF still very much in the picture. like I said, he aint a bad guy, sounds like somebody id like. he just works so much, is never around and has different longterm goals, and she and I share so much more backgrounds and interests. 

**I dont know how to proceed.** Im 30, dated enough women, been in a 8 year relationship, so I know what's out there. But I have never felt that way about anybody. I dont wanna push her, cause that doesnt feel right. Im not gonna wait around forever like a sidepiece tho. I told her about my feelings, was very honest all the way through. but even if anything was to happen, how would that work? do people literally move from one relationship to the next one? is there a calm in between necessary? how smart is it to give up something that aint bad, for me? thats still risky, I am very aware of that. also, I will be away for work for the next two months, so reality is also still here.

**tldr**: met girl in an open relationship, clicked instantly, with so much in common its like a cheesy movie. got closer, talked so much, made out, spent a weekend away after two months of talking to see if this was a fling or not. turns out its way more than that, and she is thinking out loud if I would be a more suited BF to her, than actual BF.  have no idea which way she leans, as it's all overwhelming as of now.",05Nov2019,0
128,"No I’m not over us. And just because you still care about me I pretend we may still have a future together. But you’ve said before “I’m over you” and “the past is in the past.” But I don’t wanna believe this stuff. I don’t wanna believe that we’re in the past. I love you to much to think that. 

I always make up false stories in my head to make it seem like we’ll get back together. That like what happened before we’ll find each other again. And everything will be amazing again. But then when I realize it’s not gonna happen. I’m heartbroken again.

It’s like hearing you saying “I have to” after I asked “Are you breaking up with me?” Like my heart suddenly just drowned into nothingness. 

I’d never let you go if I had a second chance. I’d hold you every single day. Make sure you were never sad. Buy you your favorite candies and bring you flowers. Make you breakfast in bed. Make sure you knew that I loved you. 

But i’ll never be able to do that stuff. Because you don’t love me like that anymore. But sometimes I wish you would lie to me. And pretend to have feelings for me that weren’t platonic. 

I hate how whenever I accidentally touch or get too close to you. Your face shows shock and I hint of disgust. 

Or that your friends used to praise me. And say they were gonna get us back together. But now if a guy says your hot they tell him “she’s single so you have a chance ;)” 

It’s just killing me. 

You were my first love and I was really really hoping you’d be my last. As pathetic as that sounds. I remember I used to be scared to death of us breaking up when we were together. Because I wanted you so much before we started dating. No matter how many times you’d friend zoned me, told me about your crushes, or said how straight you were. 

And sometimes I really hope that maybe it will happen again. Like you saying your completely over me but you secretly still in love with me.

It ain’t gonna happen though I know that. 

But I have a question. How was it so easy for you to get over me?

That’s all and well if you ever decide you want me I’d come right back to you.

131,"And I don't even want that job . I am very nervous , I don't know what they are going to ask me and I just keep searching online for usual questions and answers . I don't know if they are going to test me on my knowledge and that stresses me even more . I am even stressed about how long will the interview last. 



And the thing is I don't even want to work there. I searched this company and people don't really say good things. The salary is low and the hours are not that good either. But the thing is I am 24, I have never worked before and I still don't have my degree. And this company is also sightly related to my degree. So I don't know if I should take this job (well IF I get the job ) just to gain some experience. 


I have also applied to another company that I would prefer so much more to work but it is even harder to get an interview there.  And they also told me that it's going to be around 4-6 weeks till I hear from them ,for good or for bad news. But this job opportunity is so much better . So let's just all pray for me that I'm going to hear from them soon with good news. 



Till then I'm going to keep reading questions about the interview tomorrow and just hope that I will get enough hours of sleep",05Nov2019,1

Someone you can text halfway through your day maybe ring just to see how they're doing, someone to surprise you with a gift or a hug someone who actually knows your likes and dislikes.

Can you imagine sleeping next to someone who feels comfortable with you being you?

I.. I know there are alot of people out there in relationships but there's also so many of us out there who have no idea how that feels.

I was in love once, I was too young and it was a long time ago now -- I can't even remember what she looks like anymore, nevermind what it felt like.

I can't imagine what it's like to have a significent other, please if you read this and i'm describing you tell me what it's like. Tell me what's good tell me what's bad cus i'll never know.

I'll never know. 

I just imagine it's like being full of butterflies and floating at the same time except there's someone holding you hand too.

Someone you love who won't let go.",05Nov2019,3
