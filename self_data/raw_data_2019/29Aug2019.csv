0,"Title basically says it. My parents put up cameras in every room of my house that isn't a bedroom or bathroom. And now I feel so uncomfortable and anxious leaving my room.  I hate feeling like I'm being watched and I don't know what to do about it. The cameras are the kind that you can talk through and my dad keeps scaring me by talking through the camera when the motion detector sends him a notification on his phone. I can't say anything about how uncomfortable it makes me because my parents will just say that if I'm not doing anything I'm not supposed to be doing theirs no reason for me to be uncomfortable.Everything that's recorded is saved to a cloud so they can go and watch everything anytime they want to.  They're already using it to watch what me and my younger brother are doing and now every time I leave my room I want to cry. 

I'm 17 and my brother is 15 

This is kind of all over the place sorry I just needed to talk about it somewhere. If anyone else has gone through something similar it would be really helpful to talk about it.",29Aug2019,0
1,"I’m not sure where to begin. I suppose that first I’ll start with a few things about myself. I am 22, male, I am a virgin, and have never had a girl friend. I’m relatively handsome according to most of the people who know me, or at the very least I’m cute in manly sort of way (not my own words), and although I have a pretty bad lack of confidence in my looks my self-esteem has been improving lately. This is very difficult stuff for me to talk about because I’m always scared of how it will be received, but today I did some introspection and now I can’t shake these thoughts. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t know how anyone stands being single. I have been single my entire life and I have never gotten used to it. It isn’t that I’m not assertive, and it isn’t that I don’t try hard enough, I can’t back that up but just take my word for it. I have several reasons off the top of my head that I can think of which have contributed to me being single all this time: 

1. I’m not picky, and I don’t really have high standards at least not higher than is normal. I just like pretty girls with a slim figure, that's it, nothing abnormal about that. She doesn’t have to be a super model or anything, that’s just ridiculous. But even though I find a lot of women pretty, I almost never have a crush or feelings for anyone. But when I do I can’t explain it and it has happened only a couple of times in my life, but after I’ve seen someone a few times and spoken to them it’s like something clicks and they’re all I can think about. I can’t help it, it’s almost like an instinctive urge/need to get to know them, it doesn’t even feel voluntary and I don’t know what causes it. And it drives me up the wall because I’m reminded of the fact that I am intimately lonely and always have been. 
2. The second thing is that I’m bit awkward in conversation, or I don’t think of especially smooth/attractive things to say until after the fact. There’s not much to say here, I’m just a little awkward and shy it makes it hard for me to communicate what I want to. 
3. The very few girls who have given me the click are openly uninterested, or I find out they have a boyfriend. I don’t know what that says about me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’m so tired of being single and I don’t know how to fix it. I NEED a lover in my life; I don’t know how I’ve been able to live this long without someone special in my life. It’s not like I’m just sitting around waiting for someone to fall in love with me, I make genuine attempts to flirt and communicate my interest and be considerate of others', but they’ve never gotten me anywhere (even when I’ve been told that it was smooth or charming). How can anyone bear to live like this? 

&amp;#x200B;

Please be considerate of the fact that this was very difficult for me to talk about, and try to offer genuine advice if you’re going to offer anything. Please don’t be too harsh, I know I’ve got some problems, I’m working on them. It’s just the above thing (number 3) recently happened again, making this the third time it’s happened. I don’t know if I’m let down, heart broken or what, I have no idea what this emotion is. I’ve always been a very emotionally attuned and sensitive to the feelings of others, but I still don’t know what this feeling is. It’s like a heavy rock in my stomach and tension in my heart.",29Aug2019,0

Well I’ve been working on my self a lot i.e ... reading self care books, exercising and dabbling in laws of attraction and manifesting great vibes , well lately I feel I’ve been tested on telling my past no.

12,"1 John 4:5 -  They are from the world. Therefore what they say is from the world, and the world listens to them.

i would show this in pictures so you can see it easier, but its obvious no one here will hear me or understand what im saying.

 Exodus 13:12  -  That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD **all that openeth THE MATRIX,** and  every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males *shall be* the LORD'S.

the movies of the matrix is about neo being born. he is not even a baby yet. at the very end when he sees that golden light, it is an egg.

john wick is the sequel to the matrix. that entire movie takes place in a womb. you can notice here that john wick has much more hair than neo, that is because babies in the womb begin to grow hair, and neo has very little hair.

there is a reason why the agent smith looks exactly the same as every other smith. look at a picture of sperm trying to enter an egg. all the sperm look exactly the same. smith = sperm. 

neo is the one sperm that reached the egg.

john wick is the baby forming in the womb, the one that grows its hair.

this is not a joke at all. this is really what movies do. the movie industry is occult, devil worshipers, and evil.

13,"Singing has always brought me this odd sense of comfort. I don’t know if it’s a version of self-soothing or what. I am too embarrassed to do it in front of others, because I know it’s nothing special. I have been involved in music (via playing instruments) in my life- I know I’m not tone deaf; but I also know I’ll never be good enough to sing and have others WANT to listen. My husband has heard me sing, but he doesn’t ask me to stop out of courtesy I’m sure (good man ;)). 
Anyone else find comfort from singing? Even if it’s to no one at all? 
Also- any tips on how I could improve my voice? I know I’ll never be Celine Dion or anything, but I would sure love to be able to sing when I feel like it and not worry that I’m actually bothering someone or ruining their day by doing it (lol). 
If I could afford a voice coach (and wasn’t embarrassed to use one for the sole purpose of singing for the sake of singing), I totally would. But I can’t. :/",29Aug2019,9
14,"I (straight female 23) introduced myself to this girl at the bar the other day bc I know we’re friends on twitter and have mutual friends and she was right in front of me because her dad introduced himself to me (after introducing himself to one of our mutual friends) and when I talked to her it was SO awkward like I always shake peoples hands which they never understand what I’m doing bc I guess people don’t do that anymore so I shook her hand and she looked at me like I was psycho lol

Anyways as much as I wish she was awkward because her dad was clearly in there meeting young women with her around it felt like something else like she already had negative feelings towards me for something. I know how paranoid that sounds but our town is so like that I just don’t think it’s unusual. 

It just sucks bc now I’m in bed wondering why people don’t like me or what I did to give off an impression. I don’t know, this is just mindless venting but you know how sometimes you meet people and you’re just not worried about if they like you because you can tell they do? You just know, and then some people you really can’t tell and there’s some weird barrier. 

Maybe it’s a woman thing, insecurity or jealousy or intimidation maybe? Some girls just seem so comfortable when I talk to them and others are stiff and wide eyed (how I act usually) so I tried not to be the stiff wide eyed girl for once and instead received it and NOW I’m wondering if that’s what everyone thinks when they meet me!! That I don’t like them bc I’m awkward and don’t say much!! It probably is and now it just makes sense I guess. 

I know this is dumb and I’m probably crazy and I’m not singling this one girl out it just feels like this happens every time I try to make friends and it’s frustrating because it would be so nice to click with someone bc I haven’t had a close girl friend in a while.",29Aug2019,2
15,"Stepping out of the high school with my diploma in my hand, I felt nothing. Not angry, not confused - Just lost. 

My entire grade school career (K-12) I've been alone. Never hanged out or talked to anyone, didn't use social media, never went to events/parties/prom, never interacted with my teachers, nothing. I rarely ever talked to my own family, and whenever I did it would end in one party feeling angry. The only thing I've had since I was very young was the internet and video games. After middle school it was my only source of fun and interest. Eventually I grew addicted to it, and I soon stopped caring about my grades. Why care if no one cares about me? I can lie all I want and no one will bat an eye because in the end they don't care, I don't care. Nothing matters.

I've always had this non-caring attitude and it greatly affected my schoolwork. I don't like it, but when no one cares why should I? I was a straight C-D student and after graduating I had a sudden realization that I wasn't going to get into the university of my choice (the one literally 5 minutes from the high school), my friends would leave me, my parents would disown me (think stereotypical asian parents hard on academics), and I'd be alone. 

I've been getting therapy and after each session it makes me feel worse that all I needed was someone to talk too and I would've ended up in the university that I wanted, being the youngest person in my grade, coming from a semi-wealthy minority family. It sounded like a dream, but that's all gone now.

I'm 19 now and I just got denied again from the university. I want to take classes at the community college but I know the story will be same, with me barely passing and dropping my GPA even lower. I don't know what to do but I can't muster any emotion. The only thing keeping me from killing myself is my girlfriend, and she thinks I'm taking classes at our university.

19,"My ex, Mary, and I were together for 7.5 years and when I ended things, it was because I was frustrated with the stagnation in our relationship and lives. She was putting off pursuing her dreams because she thought we were comfortable, and I was uncomfortable with myself and where my life was and my gaze was straying. Girls at work, girls at the store, girls at the beach... they all seemed new and interesting. I thought it was a byproduct of my general ennui. 

My dad cheated on both my mom and step-mom, my step-dad also cheated on my mom. I loved Mary too much to hurt her by cheating on her. I learned the pain that causes from the worst. Or so I thought.

We broke up as amicably and drama-free as you could imagine. We stayed happily together after we decided to break up until she moved to pursue her Master's. I really thought I was doing it right. I thought I had learned how to be better than those I used to view as weak.

Around two months after the official end of our relationship, I made a Bumble account. I told myself it was just to meet people, see what's out there, and see if I had made a mistake. At this time  Mary and I were still talking every single day, through text, call, video chat, and sending each other memes and selfies throughout. We would regularly send naked pictures of ourselves to each other and I led her to believe I was only pursuing the betterment of myself and my life. I told her I loved her every single day and she said she loved me back. 

And I do love her. She is the most amazing person I have ever met. I can't even describe how stupid I was to not marry this girl and create a beautiful family with her. If I were even remotely intelligent I would never have questioned anything for a second. She is incredibly sweet, kind, driven and intelligent. She is absolutely beautiful. And I don't mean I love her so she's beautiful to me, she is drop-dead gorgeous and absolutely a million miles outside of my league. She is as real as a human being can be. I didn't deserve her when I was with her and I certainly don't deserve her now.

I met girl1 on Bumble and we agreed to meet and have drinks near my work. She was enjoyable to talk to and fairly pretty. The conversation was going well and we got bored of the brewery so we went back to my place to have wine and continue. She was my first ever one-night stand. She told me the next day she was not interested in a long-term relationship and we shouldn't see each other again. I didn't have a problem with this.

Two weeks later, I met girl2 on Bumble and we chatted for a little while longer before meeting. We had some dinner and then went back to my apartment to go hot-tubbing. We had sex that night and again five days later.

To tell the truth, I think I was just looking to feel like people could like me. Or be attracted to me. I grew up fat, ugly, and weird. I was always awkward and overweight, and never had a lot of success with women. Recently after losing weight I am fairly happy with how I look, and god, it went to my head so fast it's actually a very scary look at how sad of a person I am.

Today I couldn't take it anymore. I honestly thought maybe I should take it to my grave to protect her feelings, and prevent the collateral damage of my colossally stupid actions. Would it be better if I just lived my life as a liar and hypocrite if it meant she could be happy?

I ultimately decided I respect and love her far too much for that to be the case. If I were her, and I found out she was lying to me about something like that, it would break my heart. If she told me the truth it would break my heart. But at least I would know she trusted me with the truth.

So I told her. And I broke her heart. And I would give everything I own and more to go back in time and never leave in the first place, but I know she deserves better. This is a moment where she learned she deserves better and I learned people deserve for me to be better.

Everyone I talk to in my life tries to make me feel better by saying we were broken up, I didn't do anything wrong, my dad even suggested I shouldn't have told her anything! Still a piece of shit after all this time. But so am I.

21,"A friend of mine committed suicide some time ago and I’m still trying to get over it, but my mom keeps using the suicide of that friend as an example of what would happen to me if I don’t cope well with stress. When I told her that her death had nothing to do with stress in school and everything to do with stress at home, my mom presses on further to pry for the details which made me very very uncomfortable. However, what pissed me off the most is when I started talking about her dissociative disorder, my mom, who is very religious, said ‘I think she was possessed by the Devil.’ I then shut up completely.

In addition, when I was 16, before my friend’s suicide, I had confided in my mom that I am feeling suicidal due to the stress of many different things, including trying to come to terms with my sexuality when crushing on someone who was openly homophobic. However despite all that, I managed to attain the best grades I’ve ever gotten. This gave her the opportunity to claim that ‘although you studied until you felt like dying that year, it was all worth it because you got good grades right?’ 

Even till now, she still uses that against me saying ‘remember the time you said you wanted to die? And how your grades got better? You have to suffer to taste the sweetness.’ No, it was NOT a time I wanted to remember. It was a horrible period of time that I’ve wanted to push to the back of my mind, but simply cannot as she keeps bringing it up despite my attempts to make her stop talking about that phase. No. That did not make my grades go up, but it was because I met a wonderful new classmate that motivated me to work harder.

26,"So new year in school (I'm 19) and lucky me managed to fall in love with the first girl to smile at me. Typical, but at least it went ok I guess? We had a few moments together (that were spoiled), but ultimately we didn't find any chemistry (and I guess my lack of understanding how to interact with people contributed too), struggled to talk together at times and generally I don't think she really enjoyed my company. Maybe I should have taken the initiative more often, maybe I should have not overcrushed so much. I suppose it doesn't matter.

What does matter is the fact that she tried, but now seems to have fallen out and kind of avoids me. Her smiles are less genuine, less playful, more ""I-have-to-smile""-ish. They lack any sense of enjoyment. While I completely understand that this was a failure and need to move on, I'd like things to not develop to a state of ignoring contest, with this air of resentment, or maybe just awkwardness. Kinda difficult to determine. I especially think this is important because we genuinely did have some great moments together, and I really do think that up to a point, she liked me. Maybe even fancied me. But I don't know how I should do that. I can't eat with her anymore, the only times we will meet will be in the stairs and the hall in which we live (boarding school, btw). I want to be able to talk to her without seeing the light and the will to live leave her.

Hi Everyone. A bit of a background to my question. I've been planning on emigrating to New Zealand or Australia for a while now and decided that a degree would assist a lot to obtain those extra few points on a Visa application.

I finally decided that i should bite the bullet and get cracking and start applying at various institutes and see where i can squeeze in.

While hunting/researching place to study at it suddenly dawned on me that i would have no idea whether the institute has any accreditation in another country. How would i be able to verify that. Is there a website that i can use to verify against?

41,"Hi everyone,

First off, this is an alt account because I want to keep things seperate and English isn’t my first language, so my apologies for any mistakes.

So a lot has happened and to some it might seem frivolous, but we are all stuck living our own lives and we have to make the best of it. I just need to write this down and hope that maybe someone could give me some perspective on the matter.

This shitfony started 5 years ago with losing my business because my friend and business partner (known him for over 15 years) had other ambitions which forced a closure. Shortly after I moved quite far away from home to make a fresh start.   
(I am aware of the whole ‘don’t start a business with a friend’ now, but I trusted him, but yea it’s a no-go.)

After I had moved far away I started working on getting my business taken in by competitors, while keeping up the shop and have items produced (I still owned the IP, but had too little money to reboot) and was struggling to continue to do what I loved doing.   
The first company was very interested and asked me to work with them for a week to see if we had any chemistry. After doing a week of unpaid work for this company, they told me they were very interested and promised me a contract, which they would contact me about at the end of the week. I patiently waited for two weeks and called, the owner was unavailable but they would ask him to get back to me... I'll save you the cringe, but after three months I gave up.

During those last two months I had set up a meeting with another competitor, less compatible, but it was possible. These people were honest and told me they could only offer me 10% of the sales and I'd lose my IP... This was their business model, since they had their products made by designers (same deal) and they said if they were me, they wouldn’t take this deal… Obviously I wasn’t going to hand over a baby for 10% and forget about it.  

Now it had been about 3 months into moving I needed to start looking for a job. Mainly because the little money I had was gone. However the area we moved into did not have many jobs, but at the end of the day, money is money and bills needed to be paid. So I worked for a few low wage, low appreciation and high rotation businesses, in mostly managerial jobs. 

After about 2.5 years I was having a lot of pain in my legs, I thought it was mainly because I wasn’t used to these ‘standing around all day jobs’, but when I went to the doctor, I was diagnosed with Arthritis, both knees and ankles. I haven’t reached 40y old yet. But I kept going, took measures, painkillers and even took a second job. I needed to save up money and get back on my feet and maybe start my own business again at some point. The second job had actually decent pay and was quite a cushy job, because I could work from anywhere I wanted.

Things were looking alright, minus the health issues… Then the most important person in my life, my mother, got diagnosed with cancer. Her life expectancy was a year at most, but she fought tooth and nail. To the surprise of the hospital, she was declared in remission after a year. My family and I celebrated, only to break down once more after two weeks, my mother had had an epileptic fit, just about managed to reached the neighbor and was taken to the hospital. She had 4 brain tumors, the size of golfballs…

My mother got new medication which helped her and gave her new energy, that Christmas my family, including my mother came over to my town for Christmas. My mother pushed herself to the limits and on the way back home, she had a big epileptic fit. She could barely speak after that. The months following, I had taken compassionate leave and used up all my holiday’s to look after her. I considered myself lucky that I had the second job, because it helped me pay the bills. My sister and I took the brunt of the care, because my mother refused to have any care or go into a care home. Because we respected her wishes, we decided we wanted to be there for her, since she had been there for us our whole lives.

For 2.5 months I had moved in with mum full-time and was caring for her, this really broke me as a person. To see someone you deeply love, break down and deteriorate. She loved to talk, but she couldn’t string more than three words together, and later not a single word. She held on to life, never leaving the house, just drinking, smoking and watching Netflix… But she loved the company, oh god she did. And even though her personality changed, she was always thankful, loving and appreciative.

After these 2.5 months, I had to go home and be with my partner, do some work, back to the normal world. After 3 weeks, I flew back to care for mother again.

This went on for a while, and at some point, you just wish she let’s go and pass on, because it was getting worse and worse. She could barely walk, had to carry her up to bed, shower etc. Your own mother! The one that unconditionally had been there for me.

It was in May and I couldn’t take it anymore, I had blanks in my memory, time had passed. I had a phone call from my regional manager, ripping me a new one\*, right after another fit of mother… (The company wasn’t doing great and I guess...I don’t know why) But I was f\*in done! I flew back home to spend time with friends, my birthday was coming up and I was hoping to have some social interaction, drinks etc. 

\* I quit this job soon after, there were rumors or gossip that I was supposedly faking my mothers illness, etc etc. Which is probably why I got treated that way. Anyway, I had no energy for this, so I handed in my resignation.

A little over a week after my birthday I started having dreams about my mother and that I had to go back home… She was calling me.

When I got home I arrived late and I went to see mum the next day. The day after that she was gone. Passed away. Exactly 14 days after my birthday. 

At first we were all with mixed feelings. Because on one side mum was no longer suffering and we were free, the other side was that she was gone forever.

On the day of my mothers funeral I got an e-mail, saying I was made redundant from my other job, because the company closed down due to Brexit…

It’s been a month and a half now, my savings will last me until the end of the next month. But I suppose there is some inheritance money coming within the next couple of months.

I have to go look for a new job, but I am kind of drifting now. I have spurs of emotional breakdowns, feel depressed (but only socially crippling), but I still go out to meet people.

Some people tell me to go do something I love, but I got bills to pay and there is hardly any work around here. I got some ideas for a business and maybe I should put some of the inheritance money towards it… I dunno. Started to make music again, which is therapeutic, but I am at a loss.

I am adrift, floating around and almost paralysed to do something.

Worrying that bad dissisions with continue this shitsymphony, even though the chorus has passed...

If you are still here, thank you for listening, I really needed to get this off my chest.

Any advice?",29Aug2019,1
42,"Here's a breakdown of my life till now:

* I'm educated as an engineer, worked 2 years at a top engineering job, right after college. I was in a position of power, in-charge of 1500 people, and getting paid top money. I was all of 21 back then. 
* I quit that job against my parents' wish, to pursue my artistic dreams. I became a graphic designer, an installation artist, a filmmaker - in that order. I worked with clients local and abroad. I made lots of money and blew it all up. 
* I raised the best dog in the world, a male Rottweiler thats 9 years old now, and thinks he's a 9-month old Labrador puppy. 
* Between all of this, I flew across the world to meet someone I loved, got cheated upon in a month.
* So I backpacked all over North America, Mexico and Central America -  for 6 months. Hitchhiked and couchsurfed all of it. 
* I have a pretty bad relationship with my folks because of my lifestyle. The fact that I don't have a traditional job, and am not married yet.
* What makes it worse is, I have no desire to get married and ""settle down"". Also, I'm bankrupt right now. Haven't worked in all of 2019. Have no place to call home.
* I have incredible friends though, I stay with them and pay whatever I feel like paying. They don't expect me to pay rent.  


I spend my days reading books and watching YouTube videos. Midlife crisis, existential crisis, motivational interviews, podcasts and audio books - that's my life. I go on long evening walks and then hit the gym. I spend a lot of time on dating apps, but don't really meet anyone.  
At this point, I've lost all desire to work for money. I find it all pointless. I don't have a 'purpose' of helping others. I've done all the artsy creative things I've wanted to. I don't have any responsibilities. I'm not answerable to anyone.

43,"I know it sounds completely normal but it was very hard to send in the paper work for child support.  It’s been 5 years since I broke up with me ex.   He’s kind of an idiot to be honest.  But, he a great dad in a lot of aspects.  He loves his daughter and is great about seeing her.  He’s just a total jerk to me.  I lost my mom in May and needless to say I’m in a take no shit mode lately.   

He stopped paying me  consistently two years ago but still manages to pay for beer and concerts.  He refuses to get an actual job (he’s healthy,strong and talented) and always has some excuse.  I mean this wouldn’t be as big of a deal except there are daycare costs the entire year. $50 a week during school and $140 a week in the summer.  Also I pay an ungodly amount for non-employer health insurance.  

It got to a point I stopped asking him about money (about a year ago) because it just caused me anxiety and upset from the argument that ensued.  I was the bigger person!  This still didn’t stop the resent and the hateful attitude from this guy.   He always makes comments and puts me down.  No appreciation for the way I take care of everything.   

The other day he didn’t ask, he told me he wanted our daughter every other week.  The same guy who doesn’t help financially, drinks daily, doesn’t work and always has a crowd at his house. I’m not sure what he wanted my reaction to be but basically I told him if that’s what he wants he needs to take me to court. He brought this up at the kids cheerleading practice.  I could have died right there.   I’ve had the papers for child support for a year and didn’t have the guts to send them.  He’s not paying me and is now demanding to change the schedule we’ve had for the last 5 years?  He’s also a jerk on million other levels that no one has time to read about. 

So I did it.  I started the process in the court system.  I’m terrified.  This guy is making my life hell but at least now I’ll have a court order on my side.  Also, this will lead into a visitation agreement that we will both have to follow.  No more carrying the entire situation on my own back.  He’s had 8 years to file himself for custody and hasn’t.  He just thinks telling me and intimidating me is the answer I guess.  There’s no way I’d volunteer that kind of time. 

I’ve kept it out of the system to protect him.  He’s got tax issues cause he just stopped filing and the state is after him cause he didn’t close his business sales tax account.  I added it up to $22k (it all public record).  So I’ll probably never see another penny.  But the hell if I’m going to put up with a damn bully.  Wish me luck cause I’m gonna cry!  Don’t have babies with assholes folks!  At least I have her.  Hopefully he doesn’t pump her head full of hate too.  Oh well I can only do me and try my best.",29Aug2019,2
44,"I've never been a big fan of breakfast and have stopped eating breakfast ages ago. A coffee is all I need to start my day.

As a consequence I'm rather on the skinny side - people often ask me how I stay that way as I'm not doing sports and rather eat a lot during lunch/dinner to which my answer most of the time is ""no clue I just skip breakfast, prolly that's the cause""

Due to all the intermittent fasting posts raising on Reddit I checked out what's actually behind it and learned that well - apparently I've been unknowingly intermittent fasting for most of my life.

45,"Previously, I posted about taking a leap of faith into a second course into BS Computer Science. Looking at the misery that happens across humanities colleges, a second course is a more apt investment than say a masters or PhD, since I suck at teaching.

I like programming. At least at this point, I can fully commit into learning it. I am close to keep up with the slightly difficult parts of C++ programming, those that I left at when self-studying, such as vectors, arrays, string manipulation. Having a semestral period to set as an artificial goal gives me better motivation to focus.

Math is another thing entirely. An appreciation of mathematics actually awoke in me since entering CS. I have come around to watching math vids online and just take awe in amazement at them equations.

But that appreciation does not translate to skills. My algebra foundation sucks. I know I need to understand calculus to get a strong foundation of algorithms. But god, first month of the semester and my brain feels like wheezing. Not to mention I probably failed all my first math quizzes.

I don't regret this choice. I don't even mind if I have to retake my math classes two or three times (provided it doesn't drag my course progress too far behind). But damn, diving back into math after a decade of neglecting it is just wow. Maybe I shouldn't have dived into the course so suddenly right after resigning from work.

And having calculus classes by 7:30am is too much. Just. too. much. Not to mention having a soft-spoken instructor. Gahhhh.

wish me luck. If the course isn't for me, I'll have my programming perseverance to keep me forward anyway. But I do hope I make it.",29Aug2019,0

50,"Lonely is bad word for this, but I have literally 3 friends. People usually like me because I'm helpful and kind but that's it. I always try my best to maintain contact, but ends on couple of talks. I can't even find a girlfriend and I don't kissed anybody. I wasn't even hugged once, despite having all desirable features (and I'm talking objectively, considering my grades and look for example). Was friendzoned 2 times, never drinked / did drugs. I'm pretty lame at group sports but good at running/swimming. I have 0 friends in my class because they are really into rap/trap music and they are treating it seriously, but I'm more rock/metal kind of guy, so they don't want to hang out with me. I don't want to tell my age, but I'm in my veeery late teens. People always talk that this is the best period of life, but I don't think so.

Despite all of this, I am really happy person. I'm just in very low point in my life, I think. But I'm sure it will fade away, cause I'm moving to other city in a few weeks.

54,"When I was 16 I got a part time job in a store selling electronics (hobby/home/specialist) and I loved it. I moved out of my parents house and halfway across the country to go to university, so I quit that job and moved at the age of 19.

I couldn't survive on Student maintenance so took a job in a cinema working late shifts, starting at 7PM and finishing at varying times from 1AM to 3PM. This was okay to begin with, but it ended up making me ill due to lack of sleep and I eventually got ruled unfit for work. This threw me into a nasty depression and I dropped out of University.

I moved back home and hit rock bottom. Thought I was going to die. I survived. I started to treat my depression. 

At 21 I got a job selling obscenely expensive phones and contracts to people that clearly couldn't afford them. And I was soulless, to the point that I was the best sales advisor on the region. I was not proud of it.

But I forewent nights out with my friends, or buying expensive things. And I paid off a £2k overdraft, built double that in savings and decided to quit and move back to Reading to be with my partner.

The day before I moved in with my partner, at the age of 22, I was offered a job with a high street bank. I have been through ups and downs, wins and fails with it, and tried to progress within the company. I was shut down a lot during this time, but I've stuck with it for the sake of wanting to develop myself and my colleagues. I

I used my savings to pay for a Learning and Development qualification.

I am now 25. 

I interviewed two days ago for a job, with the same University I dropped out of five years ago, which I think is really ironic. They called me three hours later and offered me the job. I didn't accept immediately, but I called yesterday and accepted.

Today I signed my contract, handed in my notice and agreed to a start date in September.

I think I've done really well and I just wanted to post here. Not sure if anyone else will relate to feeling trapped in retail, but I just wanted to make it known that I have no formal education and I've managed it.

55,"I love Batman whether its comics or movies about him. One thing about his suit has always amused me.  I think its funny that every movie Batman suit has a fucking 8 pack in the design. Its not skin tight, so they aren't outlines of his actually abs. Though aesthetically pleasing, it serves no tactical advantage. Like the Clooney bat nips. The could have shot out little grappling hooks, tranquilizer darts, litterily anything. But they are just there, percolated for the whole world to see. 

Other than looking cool I cant think of a tactical advantage that his suit abs could serve. It would be funny if Batman was fat as shit, so whenever he wore the suit his stomach would press against the ab part. It would permanently imprint the outline of an 8 pack on his beer belly. Ahh yes, I wish that deep philosophical thoughts floated in my mind. But instead, I cant stop thinking about fake abs on a fictional characters suit.",29Aug2019,3
56,"I’ve always hated my brother. He’s always been a little shithead fuck and does everything he can to make my life a misery. This isn’t older brother teasing crap either. He would torment me the second he gets home from work. Not working at 14? I’m a useless cunt and nobody wants me in the family because I’m not providing for them. Not spending all day out with my mates? I’m some sad fat fuck that has no friends and I’m inside all day apparently.

Whenever we argue he’d mention I always resort to telling him to fuck off, yet every time we argue he’s got his phone out trying to record me as if normal people would see him making my life hell and find it funny or something.

He’s awful to our mum as well. The way he treats her disgusts me. Hates her food and insults it and her to her face,  yet complains to his dad (we have different dads) that she isn’t feeding him when she doesn’t cook for him. Rips into her for smoking yet he would go smoke weed all day. Always borrows money from her but complains when she can’t afford things.

When my dads around he doesn’t allow it. In his younger days my dad was the local hard man kind of thing, very few people could beat him in a fight and around the local area people knew not to fuck with him. So when he is being nasty with my mum, which is a rare occasion when dad is around, he’s quick to sort him out (not physically but can certainly stick up for us and soon shut him up).

He’s a deadbeat lowlife. Claims his rich but has no intentions of ever moving out, spends all his money on weed but complains he doesn’t have any money. He thinks he’s some big time drug dealer, saying he is earning money for the family despite the fact we have never seen that money.

He sometimes gets me to hand over little tins of weed to his friends. He’ll be at work and phone me up telling me to go collect it and his friends will be over. I hate doing it but his friends are already on their way so I dread the thought of politely telling them to fuck off.

His mates are real degenerates. This isn’t just them smoking weed. Honestly if you saw them you’d stick them on r/trashy and I’m disgusted at how they have the audacity to spit in our garden.

There have been times my brother has threatened me with a knife. He also frequently slaps and shoves me around and he’s too big to really fight back against.

Lately in the U.K. we’ve had a problem with knife crime. Whenever I get a knock on the door I hope it’s the police to either tell us he’s been killed or he’s killed someone because it would make my day. I know that sounds sadistic but if you knew him like I did you’d agree. I’ve even thought of killing him myself once. I believed the only way to get him out of my life is to kill him or myself. I’d even have some dreams of stabbing him in the middle of the night and dumping his body into the canal.

Now let’s be real here. I’m not going to do that so nobody worry. I have plans for my future and I don’t want that rat screwing then up.

But I just want him to get arrested. He thinks he’s immune and won’t get caught but I know he will and I wait eagerly for that day.

If that day doesn’t come I can be rest assured that he’ll probably die of smoking related health problems. If not I’m gonna cut him out of my life anyways.

61,"Sometimes, cancer is just fucking *random*. My (23F) mother died earlier this month after a 4-month battle with ovarian cancer. Everyone in my life has been incredibly supportive and understanding, but some people have wondered out loud, ""why?"" ""there has to be a reason"" ""could it have been ____?"". And it's frustrating. 


We know cigarettes raise the risk of lung cancer, and excessive sun exposure raises the risk of skin cancer. But, that doesn't apply to any and all cancers. Sometimes, there just simply IS no reason. My mother didn't have ANY of the risk factors, she actually had all of the protective factors. And she still got the worst type of ovarian cancer. 


I know as humans we want an explanation, a reason for something so terrible. But I think focusing on all the ""what ifs"", that hold no weight, downplays the tragedy of it. Your cell could have a ""bad day"" and decide to multiply into cancer, regardless of all your efforts to avoid it.


This is not the time to become suspicious of everything. This isn't the time to search for a specific event/product/etc. that caused this. The reality is life is short, unpredictable, and not everything has an explanation or purpose.


Love your loved ones. Realize that humans don't understand as much as we think we do. Life is too short to spend all your time searching for answers and avoiding things out of fear. When it all comes down to it, cancer is often random.",29Aug2019,11
62,"TLDR: Idk what to do in my spare time.
--
Hi i'm 26.

I work mon-sat 7-12 hours a day. Sometimes sundays too.

I recently stopped smoking tobacco+weed and started to do light weights+eat more. I find alot of the time i'm simply too tired though, feels like there's not alot of spare time. 

I always wanted to be a police officer, I live on my own and have no family or friends. My apartment could do with a bit more furniture and homey things. 

I don't want to ever go back to college, or university, or take out an apprenticeship. It just does not appeal to me as it did at a young age.

I do want a dog; maybe several. A partner too but, I don't think it will happen. The dog will, the partner won't.

If you asked me my favourite things in life in general it's healing on world of warcraft, smoking weed, being around dogs- I like to sit and contemplate (it means think). Forests, caves, mountains, those types of places, solitary places.

I like to listen to fast paced techno edm or nightcore music if i'm gaming, to get the blood pumping. But if i'm smoking or just lying down I can easily put some classical on or something ambient, relaxing. 

I live in a town and country that is kinda like a retirement home. So many people in this town will tell you 'I want to move' if you ask why? 'It's boring'. There's not alot to do, it's more like a retirement home. That doesn't mean I want to travel.

I'm quite fearful of travelling, I get anxious enough just sitting here on my sofa can literally feel my heart going dum dum dum thinking of getting on a train. 

So i'm quite anxious, that's why I wanted to stop smoking - not indefinitely, we all have our own way of having fun, but it does make me anxious and a customer pointed out the other day that it was obvious I looked like someone who smoked weed, was kinda upsetting. I don't wanna be that pothead convinience store clerk who is a waste of space.

I don't know what to do, with my life in general though. I get £1200 a month and it costs around £800 a month to live well. Sure I need a few things but, I don't need hundreds of thousands. What would I do with it?? 

We all need money but, I don't need that money. I obviously take it, but I don't need it. I've been homeless some years ago, you can live off of alot less. 

I'll delete this post tonight so you can type your heart out and be honest, just tell me what you'd do if you were in my shoes, or anything. Tell me anything, I really don't know what to do.

It feels like I can keep working at my shop and do weights to work on my appearence and mind, whilst looking for a dog to take home and generally working on my mental health too, playing the odd video game, going for jogs, preparing some nice meals, but is this it?

I'm 26, I have at least 24 years of good health me left and then 20 potentially 40 years of an old me.

I can't think of anything to do though, I just, I'm a bit confused tbh; it might be easier if I explain it like this.

When I was unemployed I had to be assessed by doctors because of my mental health; I told them I wanted to die by suicide. I always told myself in the back of my head this was because I was unemployed, because if I got employed i'd have money so I could eat food + everything else you do with money.

The time has finally come where i'm financially straight and narrow and I still want to die, I don't see the point in carrying on. I'm not going to do anything, i'd of posted at r/SuicideWatch if I was haha. But the facts remain, I was sucidal before and i'm suicidal now.

I need a reason to wake up in the morning. A partner is an ideal solution but you can't just force someone to be with you, how selfish. 

I hope this post was easy to analyze, if not here is me:

Years passed and I have been realising how many things I have been missing out from life.
I know it has no sense to talk about it, and it won't change things.
Seems to be more a rant post. I understand.
Felt always the misunderstood person, the one that is used, to copy homework, to do the things other don't want to. To be picked last during the p.e. classes. To be never invited in events or never been involved in things.
I am pathetic as human being.
Extended family lives on the other side of the world so there has never been that type of bonding that a lot of families have, getting together during celebrations or in hard times. Family and I have faced and handled things on our own.
Also my family are sort of social outcasts as well. We are immigrants we should be thankful for what we have. That's my dad's line.

Obviously the romantic part is not existing so there is not even the need to talk about it.

I used to day dream about her. I'm sitting there, in 2nd period math, in my chair, and the lecture currently underway is merely a background murmur. I'm not in the class, I'm laying on my back in a grassy field looking up at the clouds with her, and were smiling. ""Uh HuM?!"" No, I'm in fact in 2nd period math.

I want to tell her how I feel. I go through these scenarios in my mind, endlessly. There she is, its time. ""Hi Lani, I like you. Can we hang out?""

....""no, I kind of have a boyfriend"".

I'm crushed. I had thought of this moment for weeks, months even. What was wrong with me? How could I be so stupid to not know she had a boyfriend? What makes him better than me? She doesn't want me.

This theme continued for me. In high school I blossomed. I joined the football program as well as track and field and went on to be a first team all league two way starter who was on every special teams as well. I never exited the field. I was champion middle distance runner as well. I was tall, and super fit,l and handsome. I had one girlfriend my whole high school experience and it lasted 3 weeks, and I kissed her one time.

College was similar. Played football, team captain, bio major, smart, handsome, and utterly ineffective with any woman. I was the worlds leading specialist in the ""crash and burn"" approach. It was soooo hard for me to talk to women. The fear of being rejected and yet again confirming that I'm somehow flawed to the point of utter unwantedness was always there. I fact, even at victory house parties for the football players, I was there feeling lonely and having to drink to build some semblance of courage. Mainly, it was probably to just silence the inner monologue of doubt. ""Hi, I'm Nate. How are you doing tonight?"" Sounds like a normal question. To me, it was like an alien probe sent out to detect even the smallest indication of interest. I'm holding it together, and I'm hoping we can get to phase 2. Phase 2 would be actually talking, as that would mean she may possible be interested, and maybe down the line, she may want me. Well, what usually would happen is that my anxiety would gradually build up, and I would be trying to make jokes to keep the conversation going while also assessing her every gesture, glance, and movement as to ascertain what she maybe thinking and in particular, how she might be feeling about me. And BOOOM. It would happen. The balloon of hope I had inflated by having her stand there interacting with me would pop. ""Hey, you seem really nice, but I'm going to go find my friends now. Have fun, nice meeting you"". Yep, truly unwanted. Another rejection.

You know, for those ""ugly"" people that imagine this easy world for the attractive folks, I can say from my perspective that I would never wish to actually be ugly, but on some level I thought it would be easier. For me, to know I'm good looking, tall, and have a lot going for me, and to still be unwanted, that rejection and failure was about the essence of ME. I as a person was broken. I wasn't short, I wasn't fat, but I was flawed as a human being in some unknown way that I could not overcome with all the effort in the world. All the jokes. All the beer. Do you feel sorry for me? No. Good, me neither.

Well, I have come to wake up to something really big. I have come to understand the nature of rejection, and in a way that has provided me freedom from the experience of being rejected. It doesn't remove the risk in life, and it doesn't guarantee any results, but it has freed me from ever living in the impact of getting told no in my life. That I can put myself out there, get told no, and not in anyway invalidate that no. In fact, when I think about it this way, I find some delight in being told no because I get to experience the utter triumph over who I used to be in this regard. That being told no doesn't have to mean im not wanted. It doesn't mean im not good enough. It doesn't mean that I can't have what I want in my life. No just means No. It's someone saying no to whatever I proposed, and that is very much separate from any judgements I make about myself.

Everyone can relate to the experience of rejection. Everyone. But the question I present to you now is can you relate to being free from the experience of rejection? Not many can, because many people don't see rejection as simply and experience as I have come to. You live as if rejection is something that is actually happening. Go back to my first experience. What did Lani say to me? She said she maybe has a boyfriend right? Well then, who said that means that I'm not good enough? Who said that I am not wanted? Who said I'm hurt? Who said that I was rejected? Did Lani say those things? Did she intend to hurt me? No and no. So what I experienced was real, but only real as an experience. Lani had a boyfriend! She couldn't say yes to me&gt;

Do you know that most people fear being asked out because they hate having to say no? They feel pressure because they are aware of this human phenomenon called ""rejection"". Yet for the person being ""rejected"" they almost feel victimized. In fact, many harbor anger towards people who they feel rejected them.

When you really look at the world of rejection, you see that someone is putting their whole identity at stake in a loaded invitation. Their emotional status, sense of self, future, happiness, it is all riding on the response of someone you barely know and doesn't know you other than whatever sentences you create. In this world where rejection happens out there and is real, your sense of self now requires no freedom for anyone else. You depend on a yes, and so subconsciously are applying the pressure to the other person who you are now dependent on to feel okay. IF they say yes, you will be overcome with joy or excited, and if they say no you maybe devastated or disappointed. Do you think this has any impact on the other person? Do you think that they may experience a loss of freedom in this scenario, even if not full aware of why this feels a little awkward? How many people take that No and have it be positive? How many actually feel hurt, embarrassed, or disappointed and try to win and oscar by stuffing that feeling and looking like they are okay? Like, no, that didn't bother me. I'm fine. In fact I'm so fine and dandy, ill spend the next few weeks showing you I'm not at all affected by ignoring your existence and being ""happy"" whenever I see you.

So in the world of rejection, there are billions of opportunities to feel rejected, and people start to slow down. They stop going for it. They don't want to feel that pain, and they start to reduce their goals. They lower their standards. They pretend to not want things so they can avoid having to put themselves out there to get them. And, they think that rejection is real. Its out there waiting for them.

I will say this, and some may get it. Rejection is ONLY real as an experience. It is a valid experience, and its shared almost universally in its many possible forms. It is however not real in the world, that rejection does not come from others. It is merely and interpretation, one that we are all individually responsible without exception for creating for ourselves. In fact, most people are not saying no to your whole being. It just no i don't want to get coffee late. It's just no, we are not hiring. It's just no, I don't find you attractive as a preference. IF someone truly intends for you to feel the sting of rejection when you ask them out, would what that sick person thinks of you really matter? What kind of a sociopath would conjure ways to inflict people with all of those feelings? And why on earth would you even care what that really hurt person thinks? Wouldn't them being that way warp them enough to no qualify to have any opinion.

Its funny how when a new relationship forms, we have this consensus that tells us there has to be some time that passes before anyone truly knows each other. So saying I love you is off limits maybe for months, as nobody can know someone in only a week or two even if they dated everyday. IF that is the case, then why would you feel entirely crushed when someone you have known for 3 minutes has said they don't want coffee with you? How can that person really reject you? How can their choice actually define you in anyway, or have any meaning about you? Does that NO alter your credit scores? Does it retroactively change your GPA? Does it force you to miss payments on you car? Does it mean you cant be trusted to pick kids up at soccer practice? Does it affect the quality of the scrambled eggs you can make? Does it change the trajectory of your career? You feel like you lost something in life, but did you? No, you just made an effort to create something new, and it didn't happen. You lost nothing. So the experience you have is in fact not at all grounded in what is happening. It is a valid experience, but it is nonetheless not real other than as and experience. Its a phenomenon that only exists as a projection onto life, and you have mistaken it as life itself as if rejection has been actually happening. Nope, it never happened actually. It only occurred to yo to happen. It seemed to happen to you. But you in a sense said all those things about you. Even if someone said them, or highlighted some reason to reject you, they didn't make the impact. You had to give agreement to that to create the experience of rejection.

The question is, what does life look like when NO is no longer experienced as ""rejection"" but rather simply experienced as NO? What if you can take NO and experience disappointment, but not ever rejection? What if you could actually try this today? Go deliberately try to get a NO just to notice what YOU make No mean. What happens to someone when No simply means No? It's powerful. You give up resisting no, and many of them become a yes as you take the pressure on the other away. You take the attachments away. Your reaction to NO is refreshing and can be surprising even. When you can take no as just no, you will have more freedom to get back on track with what is important to you, and start to look at how many goals or things you said you loved or wanted in life you have pretended to move on from. How many things have you given up on in life just by fearing being told no? And this whole time you have lived like that rejection was out there, and in a sense, have been dominated by that concern to a point where you have stopped yourself.

No means No. The rest is your interpretation. You can keep it. Its valid and real for you. But, you are the sole author of that interpretation. Nobody else. But if you can start to accept no, and you can give up the ideas around rejection actually happening to you, you will have freedom and you can start to try to get as many NOs as possible because it is also inevitable that you would get that YES that would make the difference. So go and try to get a no. It doesn't mean anything about you. Being able to be with no, that is power.",29Aug2019,4

I can't keep this job even though it's all I have, not that I need anything but it's all I can say I'm doing with my life. 

Probably too late to start online school, I fucking hate it, dropped out of real college and gave up the seldom good parts of my life. All the best opportunities in the world for me grayed out of existence now. 

My life sucks, it's my fault, everything I do and say makes it worse by my choice. My own mother is the worst thing in my life and the source of a lot of stress but I don't do anything and she's a good parent despite me. How I've treated my mother has convinced me to never have children, since I try to be okay with people doing to me what I've done to them. 

I panicked this morning and felt a little sick, let myself call out of work, now I'm behind and lonely and bored and not getting money I need. I can't do school, literally and metaphorically, I probably can't register at this point, my fault for dragging my feet, even now I could try but I don't. I could never do school anyway, as in the material, I dropped out of college because I didn't care and couldn't make myself. I've conscientiously driven myself away from all the best opportunities in my life, I see paths I could've taken to be way more successful, and happy, an entirely different person, but that's all impossible now. 

It's 1:30 PM and I already want to kill myself today. Usually I think of that more at night. But because of my dumb deciscion, I'm alone and bored now, and not getting paid to fuck up at my job. I want to try finding another one but no where else would pay $12.50 and my mom would make my life even more hell if I quit. I wish I was dead, ideally. I'd settle for homeless probably. But that would suck as soon as I'm hungry enough, probably, like any human that says things they don't understand. 

Somehow I spend all my money on weed but I can't find any to buy now, so the only thing I enjoyed a little in life is gone as I'm bored and alone, so I just wish I was high, somehow all the time, somehow never having weed or enough of it, somehow always stupid even when I'm not stoned.",29Aug2019,1

87," 

On July 28th, my mom became homeless. My mom was my grandmother's and great aunt's caretaker until they passed. During that time, she had to miss a lot of work to care for them. She also had to take time after they passed, because she lost her mother. My mother is almost 50 years old, and has been a single parent for almost 30 years. It all got to out of hand for her to control. and she lost her home.

She has been sleeping in her car, my home, and hotel rooms for a month now. ( I try to let my mom sleep at my place more, but I think she is too proud. She also doesn't want to impose on my boyfriend's space. I get it.)

She is stuck in a cycle. She still has a job, so she still has money coming, but it is depleted so quickly. She can't save for a new place while spending money on a room every night. We also don't have much family, so there is no one else in state that she can stay with.

Another option is to move her to Florida to stay with my brother, but she needs to find a job there. She would also need to find a high school for my sister, and uproot her whole life here.

I've been giving her money anytime I have extra, I buy her food, and I have basically fully been taking care of my sister for a month. She buys hotel rooms when she can. She even overdrafts her card so she can have somewhere to sleep. Which ends up taking more money out of her checks that she could potential use as a deposit for a new place. I just don't know what to do. She's breaking down, and I am stuck. I have no idea how to help.

When I was in school i had this insecurity that my friends were much cooler and talented than I was and it was definitely true. Everyone of them had something they were extremely good at and hence were famous for, be it music, sports, public speaking etc. whereas I was just one of their friend. I fit in only because they were my friends long before they got 'popular'. I just thought then that  this particular group of people are just really talented, not all people are like that. To be blessed with talent like they had.

I thought that Two of my best friends from my neighbourhood were just like me, similar sense of humour and not particularly good at something. I'm my last year of school one of them topped their school while the other got selected for the state's basketball team. And when i got to thinking they had been good at what they were doing before as well. While I was just one of their friend.

Finally when my college started and i settled in with some people in an apartment and they were just fun loving people who just partied and had a good time. College life seemed promising. It felt like this insecurity would easily fade away because these guys who barely do anything all day can host bigass parties and have such a lit social life would make it clear that this insecurity of mine is nonsense and anyone can have fun and be remembered.
