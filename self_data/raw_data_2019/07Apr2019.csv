0,"They care about me a lot and do so much for me but I really have a hard time saying “I love you.”

Maybe it’s because I’m afraid to show I care? Maybe I’m selfish and I don’t care that much?

1,"It was a cold Sunday afternoon.

I was listening to DEVO and masturbating to the song ''we're through, being cool'' when I noticed I was fresh out of lube.

''Shit! My penor-lube is empty!'' I yelled, angry at myself for not finding more.

That's when I noticed a lump of half eaten butter was lying under my bed. For those who don't know, I was eating butter by itself since I ran out of feta cheese and I find butter reminds me of the thighs of nerds. I then wiped the half melted butter all over my painfully erect cock and began re-masturbating.

That's when I heard a rumbling in the bushes outside and I began to hear banging against the door.

''Shit! I didn't lock my door after I went outside to water the front yard!'' I thought to myself. I bolted to the door, but it was too late. Suddenly a masked intruder strafes in front of me, holding a knife.

''P-please! Don't kill me man, I'll give you all my money!'' I screamed. Then the masked intruder began to pull something out his coat pocket.

It was a slab of butter! He began making motions with the butter knife he was holding and then gave the butter knife to me. I was confused until he slowly unmasked himself to reveal a black haired, very nerdy looking man in his late 20's. He was wearing big glasses and had skin as white as snow. My heart began to race when suddenly he told me to wipe the butter all over my neck so I did.

That's when he pounced on me, and after 5 minutes of fighting him, I grew exhausted. So exhausted I could not fight back once he grabbed my head and slowly forced it into his lap. As I knew what was about to happen, my cock became painful yet again and I let out a moan in pleasure. My entire life began to flash before me, wondering of all the things I never got to do...

He began to slowly tighten his nude but hairless thighs around my neck. As I was slowly losing the ability to breathe I wiped more butter around my neck but it was no use! My neck was simply much too fat to slip out! That's when I noticed the slab of half melted butter under my bed. I lurched to grab it and that's when I saturated my hands with butter and began thrusting my fingers up the nerd's anal sphincter. The nerd let out a high pitched wailing as I did this. I felt his anal muscles tense up on my finger, threatening to dismember it. His muscles kept tensing up and relaxing in quick succession and that's when I was so turned on by a combination of the butter, his screeching, and oxygen deprivation that we both let out a long, aroused moan. I buttered his biscuit and it felt so wrong, but it felt so good! I kept doing this for the next 3 or so minutes until I passed out. Just as I was about to pass out an old woman came into my room. I didn't know her, but she yelled ''David, your tea's ready!'' and he bolted, his lower half completely nude with half melted butter literally leaking from his anus.

It's safe to say the anal buttering probably saved my life that evening.",07Apr2019,1

Eleven months ago today our daughter Rosaura was murdered by her exboyfriend, because of this, we are all connected. All a part of society not many get to see and honestly I hope they never have to.  The night my daughter was murdered we got to see the darkest part of humanity. Not only what the piece of shit who killed my daughter was capable of but how some of society acts in a time where compassion, sympathy and empathy is needed. We were treated as overprotective parents when we knew there was something wrong. Afterwards treated as a sideshow when members of our community were trying go look into the apartment to see our daughter’s body. Family members found out within minutes that our child had been killed because strangers thought it was ok to post about it on social media. 

Lost in madness after holding my murdered child’s body I ran the street of Craycroft trying to show people her murderers picture to find where he was as my husband and family guarded to apartment door so no one could go in until the police arrived. People ran from me or told me it wasn’t their business.

My daughter was one of the most kind caring people this world ever knew, and I do not only say this because she is my child I say it because I know it 100%. She would feed others when it meant her going hungry. She would give someone in need what it was they needed with no doubts or hesitation. When she was alive this was a big concern of mine. I didn’t want her to be taken advantage of. Her reply “Mom this is what God would want me to do. If they take advantage of my kindness that’s between them and God, I did my part.”

The night I held my daughter one last time it all made sense God touched my soul and I finally understood, this world is so much more than we can understand. The weeks and months following her death many people from many walks of life contacted me. Each with a story of how she had helped them. Some didn’t even know her name but remembered her smile. My daughter was just a young 18 years she had so much more to do in life but her memory will live on with the ones she helped. 

Our family wants her legacy to continue. In her memory we have started Justice for Rosaura Inc. In reality there is no justice on this earth. Because the true justice is for the murders of our loved ones to never have happened or for the ability to bring them back. But as we all know personally, the tears and prayers begging God to rewind time just does not work.

So in memory of all our loved ones I am asking you to help me and my family change society, one person at a time starting with yourself.

We need more kindness, compassion, sympathy and empathy. In memory of the ones whose lives were cute too short lets start an army of goodness. Anger, jealousy, hate and all negative emotions and bad choices by the ones who’s hands hurt our loved ones are the reason they are gone. Let’s battle this negativity out in the streets. Show people our pain and hope they make better choices for themselves and those around them. Let’s make this world a better place one person at a time.

Be a part of Rosaura’s army of goodness, all you have to do is anytime you do a good deed, post about it on social media and tag #JusticeforRosaura #Rosaurasarrmy #armyofgoodness #strongfortheLord",07Apr2019,5

8,"and I feel like such a fucking loser.

It's not because I don't have friends. I do, and they're out having fun right now.

Today I woke up to a shitty shift (Saturday morning) at a job I hate, and to be honest I was having a pretty ok day. My friends are back in town for the weekend (university outside of the city) and we were planning to go out to eat and have fun tonight. 

Then like Satan willed it himself, my last 2 hours of my shift suddenly went to shit. I got more work than expected, customers were being annoying and shitty and my mood went to shit. Ended up staying an extra 2 hours unpaid to have to finish my shit. 

Worst part is when my friends were solidifying plans and getting ready to be picked up, I flopped dinner and whatever we were going to do after (we're an improvisational kinda group). It's not like I want to be alone or anything, quite the contrary actually. But for no explicable reason I just said ""I'm not going"". Just like that. My friends were concerned at first but they let me be cause even though I've never done that before, I'm kinda like that. 

Now because I didn't eat dinner and I'm lonely, I'm sitting at McDonald's eating chicken nuggets and fries. 

I'm actually retarded as fuck. I'm so lucky to have a life like mine and I'm throwing it all away bit by bit. What the fuck is wrong with me

If anyone actually read to the end, wow. I just needed a place to rant and felt like I was being heard.",07Apr2019,406
9,"I’m in my second semester of my first year of college. The “world is my oyster” and it’s time I “make my mark” on the world. I’m 19 years old and I’m feeling lost the more I do things as an adult. I feel like I’m just guessing my way through everything, and I disappoint myself with choices that I make. 
I grew up in a middle class home with a loving family. My dad worked in the oilfield and my mom worked in a hospital. They moved mountains to get where they are in life and to give me and my brother a life where we could accomplish almost anything we set our minds to. We never struggled with money and I was given a comfortable life for my first eighteen years. I just moved into my own house with the love of my life and I’m actually doing things for myself as an adult. I schedule my own doctors appointments, I pay my rent, I have a job, etc. 
But since moving out and starting college I seem to be doing a poor job at just about everything. In school, I’m not the best student. I procrastinate a lot and it affects my grades, and recently I’ve felt extremely unmotivated and tired. I made good grades at the beginning of the semester, but now as I’m finishing up, I’m doing poorly. It’s my fault because I don’t study as much as I should, but at the same time I hardly have the energy or the enthusiasm. 
I was always told by my parents not to get involved in any drugs- especially cigarettes because of my family history of cancer (it’s bad). I told myself I would never touch a cigarette, and I haven’t. But not long ago I went to the gas station and bought a cigar. A regular old black &amp; mild original. I smoke it and enjoyed it, I told my self I probably wouldn’t do it again. Until two weeks later, where I got the urge to get another one. I’ve had five now, and I hate myself for it. I know the dangers and I know that I could get addicted but I do it anyway.
I do things even when I know the repercussions are bad, and I hate myself for it. ",07Apr2019,3

12,"Hi all, I’m sorry for the self depreciating post up ahead. I just need somewhere to let this all out and complain before I take a 12 hour depression slumber, lol.

I am currently 5’5” and weigh 180lbs. I’m overweight. I’m on the verge of an ED, I eat only once a day and try my best to exercise 3 times a week. Growing up I was always super slim, maximum of 130 lbs, but since landing my office job my weight has ballooned and it’s hard to look at myself in the mirror.  I’m embarrassed to take photos or wear anything nice. I cry almost every night after I get dressed, I’m just so ashamed. 

My older brother is a personal trainer and is super fit and my younger sister is a high school and college volleyball star. They always make comments at me like, “hey lou_lou_belle, maybe you should eat less.... hey have you tried doing this exercise?” I used to play soccer but I can’t keep up anymore. I want to be thin and beautiful.

Now by no means do I think I am OBESE, I’m still of a smaller stature with curves but I have a lot of body fat and I’m just so insecure about it. Thinking about eating makes me sick because I know I’ll just be a fat whale in the end, id rather skip the meal.

What I also can’t stand about myself is my hair. I am 50% Haitian so I have this thick, curly mess. All I have ever wanted was sleek straight hair but I can’t have that. My hair is short (I cut it all off 2 years ago to regrow) and it just makes my face look fat. I have no idea how to braid or style my hair, I’m stuck with this mop until it grows. I have considered getting a weave but where I work is not very PC and with 90% guys and I know I’ll never hear the end of it if I did. I’ve inherited my fathers large nose and lips, and in comparison to my small round face I just look bad. I can’t stand my face, my hair, my body.

I’m just so sad. I have no confidence in myself and I hate where I am. I swing violently between “Things need to get better” and “YOLO”. I just want to look different, I want to be different.",07Apr2019,2
13,When school started I had severe anxiety and constipation due to me not eating vegetables or going outside. When grade 6 started I realized that people didn't like going near me much because since I was constipated I would pass gas consistently and I blamed it on body odor. I saw doctors multiple times until grade 7 which then I realized what I was doing wrong and that it was definitely me passing gas which made everything awkward so I went to homeschooling. I started eating healthier and I'm no longer constipated therefore I do not pass gas anymore and I feel safer being social. I have not had a single instance since then where I felt like I was annoying someone or being repulsive in any form of matter. so my anxiety is definitely decreasing and I feel better around other people.,07Apr2019,3

I have two guy friends who I trust but don't maintain enough contact to actually call them friends. I don't really like to interact in real life because I suck. I'm boring and if I try to make a joke, nobody gets it.

But I still feel the lack of companionship and acceptance. Sometimes I think about trying to find an anonymous internet friend, but I end up feeling like it'd become a chore pretty soon if I couldn't relate enough with the person.

17,"Hi All! So, I've recently been going through a rough patch in my life. As some context, I am a 25 year old male who has never been in a romantic/intimate relationship before.  After many years of trying, I finally found a girl on a dating application and I thought we hit it off very well. We had been seeing each other for about 2 months and had many many great dates, at least in my eyes (10+ dates over that time period). 

&amp;#x200B;

She finally opened up to me a couple weeks ago, though, and she said she was ""not ready for a relationship due to her previous relationship and wanted to remain friends for right now"". AKA, she friend zoned me.  Now, let me be clear, I think people are entitled to feel however they feel. At the same time, I can't tell you how many times I have been friendzoned before. This girl was my first kiss and the first person that I saw a future with but even she friendzoned me. She told me of how nice of a person I am and such. I feel like everyone views me as a friend but nothing more. This super sucks to comprehend though as I want someone who I can come home to at night and accept me as who I am. I also come off as super metro/gay to some people and this further hurts me when people call me gay or worst words.  I guess it just sucks to understand that you are not meant to love anyone and everyone views you as a friend. ",07Apr2019,1

Its been years, and its so much better now, but I am have a hard time trying to bulk at the gym because i get obsessive about calories).

My best friend who is a girl recently complimented me on the muscle ive put on. It made me feel so nice because no one ever notices.

24,"For context, I'm a really masculine girl. Like a tomboy who never ""grew out of it"", basically. I like to have short hair and I don't shave my legs, I wear cargo shorts and running shoes all the time, I try to avoid makeup as much as possible. All my hobbies are like that too: outside of drawing, which I consider unisex, I do ""manly"" things like whittling, lifting weights, DIY projects, and hiking, and I really want to get into learning more about mechanics. My dream in life is to be the breadwinner of a household.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even like having a feminine name. I want to change what I have into something gender neutral like Sam or Taylor. Even if I don't get it legally changed, I would want someone to use a neutral name as a nickname. For clarification, I am not transgender, just gender nonconforming.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like nobody could really love me for all this. I don't think I'm ugly, but I'm tall and androgynous and I've never seen any girls like me in a happy, healthy relationship. No role models at all--not in the media, not in my personal life, nowhere. No person that I know has ever said or seemed like they would be interested in people like me. Every ""tomboy"" I see in these contexts is like Scarlett Johansson: pixie-cutted, but otherwise perfectly feminine.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm terrified that nobody could really, truly love me for who I am, or for very long. I don't want to change for a potential partner, but at the same time I don't want to be seen as ""an experiment"" or ""weird"" or ""crazy"". I feel like nobody would even give me a chance.

25,"I'm not really sure where to post this but here we are. 

Today I went out with my boyfriend and we had smoothies and went to his house. There, his dad was out front, working on his truck, and when I went in, his mother and sister were in the kitchen. It was a beautiful sight. To anyone else, I'm sure this was normal, but it was something that made me want to cry. They were so hospitable, and they treated me like they'd seen me more than 3 times. They even ate dinner together! which is something my ""family"" doesn't do. My mother and father broke up when I was 5, so I've never seen them interact normally, I've only ever seen them a handful of times together and it was very awkward then. 

Some hours later my boyfriend took me home and we sat in the car and talked. It was a very personal conversation in fact, too personal. I told him things I wouldn't tell anyone. I feel like I've betrayed myself as I sit here and type this actually. 

Last year, I had a depressive episode. I did a lot of things I'm not proud of, seeing as I was a freshman in high school. But still.. I never really talk about that because it's not a period in my life I want to relive. I don't talk to most of the people from then, I try not to do the things I did then. I live in fear of going back to that dark place. Even my parents didn't put in an effort to get help for me, I told them I was depressed, not suicidal, but that still doesn't make an excuse for the lack of what they did. 

I'm sure my boyfriend's always been worried, as I'm still  a little shaky. But tonight took the cake, I'm sure. I won't discuss *how* we got on the topic but he'd asked me a question and I told him about a time I tried to commit suicide.

I'd COMPLETELY forgotten about this. I was way too young, (not even in my double digits I'm sure) to be trying anything like this but I'd done it. After the words ""when I was little I tried to kill myself"" came out, the tears started coming. I NEVER cry in front of people. Ever. I felt so stupid because I had ruined the moment and made it all depressing. 

Now I feel like he sees me differently. I know he would never admit it but I just. I don't know. I feel so dumb for making my self *that* vulnerable this early in a relationship. It was stupid, now I don't even think I want to see him after this, despite all the reassuring he did. ",07Apr2019,3

Right as I was pulling on the noose to make sure my setup was secure enough my mom tried to come in my room. The door was locked. I threw the noose into my closet and let my mom in. 
“What are you doing?”
“nothing”
“why did you have a jacket on?”
“I was cold” 
“why do you need your door locked?” 
“I don’t want Steve (my brother) waking me up” 
“are you sure you’re okay?”
“yes mom”
And she left. I concluded the hook was not strong enough for me, and so I decided to go outside and hang myself from the fence post which is, without a doubt, strong enough. Luckily for me my brother was leaving the house at this time so I follow him outside quietly telling him I’m grabbing something from my car. He leaves and I tighten my rope. It’s dark outside. And I start walking around the side of my house to the fence. I hear a noise that I think is the front door opening. It gets louder. My dad walks out looking for me. With a noose in my hand, hanging down behind my leg hidden from his view we talk.
“What’s going on?”
“I was just grabbing something from my car”
“Why are you toward the side yard then?”
“Someone left the gate open, I just shut it”
“A little weird that you’re just walking around at 10 at night, are you okay?”
“yeah, I’m fine.”

Over the summer we became friendlier over skype and began to become good close friends, then at some point the dynamic changed they said they  had feelings for me, being a loner kid whose never any sort of romantic notion thrown his was I was estatic. I didnt care they were still biologically a male, I was open to new ideas. I became enveloped by lust, the idea that another person could see something in me I never believed was there.

Many red flags began to appear in a rapid succession, first there was Bipolar/Manic Depression something I figured I  could look past having been to therapy and a psychiatrist for depression and anxiety myself. Then the was Autism again not a deal breaker, Ive had some high functioning friends and acquaintances in the past so I consider that somewhat normal. The fact that they were also a legit sociopath and suffered from BDD, to be fair they were very upfront about being a crazed sociopath(Their words) but when staring at the situation through rose colored lenses all the red flags just seem like flags.   


Then came my 18th birthday, since I was finally 18 we decided itd be fun to meet in person and they could get me stoned, we always smoked weed in skype calls and they sort of got me started on pot in the first place. We did meet in person and I did spend the night, thankfully nothing sexual happened. Nothing physical ever happened besides a hug. I then left the next day too stoned and barely made it to my car.   


Then about 6 months after that they told me that they didnt want to talk to me and that our relationship was unhealthy which was true, the scariest part was how long it took me to realize that, and how it could have gotten much worse. Part of me feel terrible for demonizing this person for the last 3 years but at the same time I wish they just fucking realized from the start what they were doing, what they were saying was wrong and gross. I feel gross saying things to them , how I wanted them sexually when all I wanted to hear is that someone wanted me aswell, I never cared for my well being or safety, all I wanted was to feel wanted as lame and stupid as it sounds. Now I feel hollow and rotten, nobody would ever want me now, Ive become a discard husk of a man.  Im afraid of intimate relations of any kind because theyll just find out about them and how dirty and rotten I am. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel as if even though it was the worst possible choice that was the only time someone would ever love me, or atleast I could pretend they loved me.

I know this post must seem like utter nonsense but thats exactly how my life feels, complete and utterly nonsensical. This is a throwaway account because Im fearful theyll find me.",07Apr2019,2

36,"I started my Saturday under five hours of sleep. Rolled out of bed to work. Went to a rehearsal after. Went grocery shopping, and made dinner in the crockpot for the evening much later. I left to a friends; we were going to watch an opera that in town, Don Giovanni.  Due to a miscommunication of free tickets she got hers and I had to start over in the back of the line for mine, so I suggested she seat instead of wait for me. 

I left during intermission before act II. I didn’t tell my friend upfront, and made an excuse to leave. I had promised my roommate I’d come to his jazz gig across the street, not realizing the massive overlap between the two commitments. 

I stood outside the hall his group is playing. Everyone is seated, and it’s an incredibly intimidate space. I felt that my place in that room would be forced since the show had begun. I left and drove back home. 

I felt like a massive asshole leaving my friend at the opera; I only felt some peace knowing she sat with another friend there and has her car. I sent them both texts explaining my absence and support. It is that time in the semester where nothing is easy and it is hard to smile. I felt like I could start charging when I got home.

My fiancé FaceTimed me with her friend. She will be rooming with him starting this summertime for school. She’s had a hard time at her school because of the lack of connection and friendship she has found in her community. This guy gets along with her great, and I’m thankful for it since there’s not much I can do in a different part of the country. I’m only human, and I felt jealous for a brief moment— not because my fiancé would ever cheat on me, but because I felt that I can only do so much on the phone compared to what friends there can do for her as well.

I talked with my fiancé on the phone that evening and started crying. It felt like a purge. I needed that to happen to me. The past few weeks have nearly killed me, I don’t know how I’ve pushed through my coursework. 

For the record, I’m not seriously jealous of my fiancé’s friend. I am very happy she has a support system there to get through school. I’ve been drained the past few weeks and today was a wonderful release. I tend to dissolve into pessimism when stressed. 

Tomorrow is a new day. A new chance to smile.",07Apr2019,1
37,"My roommate is out and I guess she forgot her key to the dorm. She asked me if I could leave my key hidden somewhere so she can get back in. I said that's no problem, and it isn't. At least it shouldn't be. I propped the key so it's not easy to find unless you're seriously looking for it. I'm talking like you're squatting down trying to look for the key. 

I was expecting her to be back late, which is probably why she asked me for my key instead of asking if I could open the door for her. I'm in bed now, but I kept stalling going to bed because I can't stop thinking about someone trying to break into the dorm. I've checked my own room door (I live in a suite with a hallway, so my door and then the door to the main hallway) every half an hour to make sure no one is going to come in. I've also checked that my key is still where I put it. 

I'm not sure what else to do besides stay up and just keep checking until she comes home. And I hope I'm not coming off like I'm mad at my roommate. She made a simple mistake. I've definitely forgotten/misplaced  plenty of things over the years. I think this might just be a me problem because I keep seeing visions that someone will come into my room and strangle me while I'm sleeping. ",07Apr2019,1

I fell for it I loved the fact that you basically made me feel great but I can see my suspicions that you told me I have nothing to worry about are definitely true. I don’t blame you if anything I blame myself. Can’t say I do t expect to hear or find out some bad news later. God knows if I don’t control the situation now that it’ll destroy me later.

42,"My ex and I split 5-6 months ago and it's only now that everything she's said, has actually hit me. We're still friends (Even though I die a little inside when I can only hug her. I want to kiss and cuddle her still!)

She loves to dance but I could never dance. 2 years together and I never thought about learning to dance. She's tried to teach me but I did not find her to be a good teacher by any means. She cooked for me but I never had dinner ready fir her, I never cooked anything nice for her. I never listened. She wanted to go to a swingers club but I couldn't stand the sight of her with another man. I'm a dick!

But since the split, I took time for myself, dealt with that post breakup depression in my own way. I ended up joining the swingers club as a single guy, I started taking dance lessons on my own, I started learning how to cook. All the things I should've done for her, I ended up doing for myself instead. 

I feel better about myself, I'm finally able to get back into dating and I've used my cooking and dancing to get lucky a few times and I use that to impress them and draw them in and I feel good, I'm doing stuff for ME now.

But I'm a dick. These are some of the big things that she wanted and I could never do them but the fact I do them now, as a single guy, I feel like a dick. I mean, we talk and I tell her everything still because it's what we did. It's how we were when we were together; honest and open. I tell her all of this stuff and I feel like a dick when I say it. I can here the distain in her voice, I can sense her staring at me, thinking ""what a fucking asshole! You wouldn't do that for me but you'll do it for some other chick!?"" But all she says is ""That's great /u/phoenixf1zzle! I'm glad you're happy! I'm happy for you!"" But you can tell it's through clenched teeth. I'm such a dick. I absolutely am, no way around it. She's right to think that, if she is.

But I feel great, I'm finally able to do things for me, I'm working on myself now and doing these things because I want to! I'm able to flirt and get back into the dating scene, I'm able to cook not just for myself but for others now, I can have dinner ready for the next woman, I can dance with the next woman, I can make love better for the next woman. I can do and be more for myself and the next woman. I feel great!",07Apr2019,2

And I feed that urge. It's hard not to.

And it grows and it grows until I'm consumed in trying to peer into her life again...


It's pathetic

I know.

Tonight I'm fighting the urge. Yeah I miss her, I always have, and i always will.

My heart still screams at me that she's the one.

She's not. She's gone.

And every time she sneaks back into my life for those brief moments filling me with joy and self-destructive levels of anxiety. Making me think this time, it was worth the torture. She's back. Forever? 

And then like she was never real. 

She's gone. A ghost again.

So I'm left empty, wondering where I could've changed things. And I always come to the conclusion that I can't. I can't change me. I'm me. I fucking love me.

But I loved you.

So stay out of my life. 

My heart will open the door if you come. And my head will trust you again soon after. So stay away.

47,"I've kept this intentionally vague, you're free to speculate what's happening, and pardon my english:

I woke up again, 3rd night of restless waking up. (In the last 7 days I've found a lot of change in my behaviour, I've lost my appetite, I can't sleep properly, I find nothing exciting anymore except one thing. Anyway, coming back to the story) First thing I did waking up? Checked my phone. No response. I checked comments, I could see latest comment was made 1h ago, I had slept for 5hrs. Didn't bother reading comments, just closed the app, grabbed my headphones and went to terrace. It was 5 in the morning, I plugged my headphones in phone and started listening to music, the usual music I listen to, the music I find very emotional, the music which sends me in deep emotional state. I was walking mindlessly on terrace in a huge circle, listening to music but my mind was somewhere else. I usually walk on terrace when I'm sad, or deep in grief (and pain) or when I want to think clearly, and usually my sadness fades away with time. But not this time. Today, while I was walking on terrace, listening to music, I was feeling pain, unlike a physical pain whose source I can easily point at, I couldn't find any physical source of this pain in my whole body. But the pain was increasing exponentially it was becoming harder for me to bear this pain, at one point, I thought of jumping from terrace, though I didn't. I stopped music, music was only increasing the pain, I couldn't even stand properly anymore so I came down again into my room at about 5:30. At this point the pain was harsh, unbearable, unimaginable, I couldn't understand what was happening to me. I decided that sleeping is the only way to avoid the pain for a time, so I slept, for about 15 minutes. At first, the pain decreased but it started increasing again to the level that it woke me up. The pain was again, excruciating, I tried meditation, tried every breathing technique, tried to distract myself but every thing in vain. Now, only one option was left, bear the pain with patience until it sinks in. No words can describe that time span of two hours. It was hell. At 7:30, I felt like I've finally controlled my pain. Now, there was no pain, no sadness, no happiness either, I was feeling neither good nor bad, I was feeling numb (and calm). I decided to work, so I opened my laptop, but I still couldn't get some things out of my mind, so I opened this site and checked for response again. no response. I checked comments again, last comment was 3h ago, though this time, I decided to read comments.I read them. I found something familiar in the comments, Is that comment intended for me? The comment described something related to my behavior in last 7 days, I don't know, it may or may not have been intended for me. Of course, the comment was made by someone I knew, someone I met in last 7 days, someone.................

After reading the comment I was feeling really really weird, I didn't know what to do so I wrote this.  
I still feel restless

48,"My 88 yo grandma was rushed to the hospital by ambulance earlier this week due to complications with the flu. Basically some other health stuff she has going on exacerbated it/weakened her immune system (yes vaccinated) and for the first 12 hours or so, it was pretty scary. Had she waited to call an ambulance for even a few minutes, we might have lost her. 
Again, she's 88, so I know she could pass any time. She's also DNR and she knows she could pass. But she still lives independently in her own apartment a few blocks from my house. (My mom lives in a house right between us, all of us within a half a mile.) So we're also not *expecting* her to die. Anyway, I had the feels. 
So, remember how she's 88? Well, the woman likes to think she's 80. She gets impatient and wants to get up by herself (normally fine but shes weak and on meds). Even after there was no immediate danger, my mom and I kind of had an unspoken agreement to stay with her until she gets out. For the first couple days, I did days and mom did nights. Then when she was okay at night my mom and I kind of overlapped. 

My grandmother tells the most wonderful stories about her life. I used to write a lot and had planned on interviewing her, and at first when I was driving to the hospital I was freaking out that I'd never even recorded anything. So I've been bringing my recorder. And shes been telling stories, some of them stories we've heard again and again, some things that just surprised the crap out of me or that I'd always wondered but never asked. 

We're incredibly close. Our whole family is close, but there is a special bond between my grandmother, my mom, and myself, and indeed it began with my great grandmother, whom I've never met but shes been remembered so well that I feel like I know her better than many of my living family. 

The writing I've done has interestingly always been meant to be about motherhood from me as the mom POV, but I look back and realize that my writing always ended up actually being more about my relationship with my mom. Anyway, I'm long past the desire of publication but I do feel deeply compelled to catalogue the lives and memories of this line of women, just for my own family. 

And I feel so proud to be their descendant, and at the same time so humbled by the awesomeness of their lives, or their ability to experience it and express it in an awesome way. 

Mostly posting because its late and I'm trying to get things out. Open to advice though on all this stuff, caregiving, transcribing, writing, whatev.

49,"I hate school for ruining my life. Sure I could get a better job if I go through school but it is just so bad because it takes up so much of my day and it has failed to teach students the right way. Adults say that it isn’t so bad but the teachers hate their jobs and only care for their paychecks so we only actually learn if they are in a good mood. I have little time because of school and whatever time I have away from school I stress of going back to school. It’s always on my mind as a constant stressor and it is just leaving me no time to feel free. I want to do good in the world but the very thing designed to help me function as a person is causing tens of thousands to fall into depression and stress beyond acceptable levels. If there was a monopolizing governmental organization that put everyone in a system taking away precious time and feeding you pointless things while scaring you about the world and taking up your free time with your thoughts as real estate. It would be so wrong but they do that to millions of kids every day and nobody bats an eye and some even support it.

I always say I'm fine being single when it comes up, but honestly it's one of the few things that really gets to me.

Every time I find someone I like, I work up the balls to ask them out and it's always a no, because they're not interested or not single. I've lost count at this point. I don't blame them.

1. I am ugly. No amount of make up or ""right"" clothes or whatever will fix it or even make me look acceptable or un-ugly enough, especially given 2. You just can't make a silk purse from a pig's ear. Plus I have a denture for top teeth and no money for plastic surgery. It's a lost cause.

2. I am old for a woman, and thus invisible to men. Especially also because of 1. Plus, I was told this week by a family member who actually loves me  that if I am sitting next to my 66-year old mother, she looks like my younger, prettier sister. Note: she dyes her hair but otherwise LOOKS 66. As do I, apparently. 

No matter how people protest that they aren't shallow, it is simply a fact that people are just shallow enough that no one will ever look at me as a romantic partner. I have a good personality. I am intelligent (just under genius intelligence, if you believe in IQ tests, which I don't). I work hard at being a good, kind, funny person. I have a great sense of humour and because of 1 and 2, I am not shallow and care nothing about the appearance of others. But I have to at some stage accept that I'll live and die alone. I don't want to, though.

 It just seems so unfair - women's worth depend so very much on their appearance, so I am basically worthless. Not to mention invisible. No one will ever look at me and start falling in love (too ugly to have sex with) so they can look past my physical appearance, that is certain and proven. And while I know I should just start making peace and being happy and fulfilled to be alone forever or whatever, I simply can't. Like everyone, I just also want someone who loves me. I know I don't need a man to be complete, but that doesn't mean that I want to spend the rest of my life alone without any prospect of love.

I used to watch anime as a kid up until I was like 14, then I dunno why but I stopped. At that time I didn’t even know there was such a thing as anime. Then sometime last year I was in school bored so I decided to rewatch Avatar because it was the last thing in my laptop that I had touched. Over the course of the week I finished it and then I started aching for more animations like Avatar. So upon researching and discovering anime and what not I remembered I had a friend that watched anime so I texted her she gave me a few titles to watch AND I feel in love!!!! After that she added me into a WhatsApp group chat where people from my community that watch anime would discuss and just talked about their favorite anime, share anime memes and all of that. I realized the talked about jojo’s a lot. They all loved it in this gc. So when I watched it I realized why. I too now love jojos but I don’t feel comfortable talking about that anime in the group because 90% of them are males and they constantly talk about how woman try their best to impress them by pretending to like anime.

I keep telling myself the same thing about never cheating and that sexual attraction is natural and happens, plus I know that logically, even if neither of us was in a relationship (he has a fiance), it would never work out (he can be super annoying and he has a young son, which I don't want kids, plus he's moving to Australia in a few weeks and I'll probably never see him again). 

I know this attraction will be over soon enough, but it makes me so mad. I feel like a shitty person for finding other people attractive when I am absolutely satisfied and in love with my husband. It also makes me slightly question why I'm in this field of work (I've had people accuse me of using my job to hook up with guys, which is definitely not true). I love the industry I'm in, and I'm passionate about the work I do. But it makes me feel like crap. :-\[",07Apr2019,1
65,"Me and my partner are forever butting heads over silly little things till one of us says something to purposely hurt the other, I'll admit it's usually me being hurtful but I don't think he sees how hurtful he can be just by not thinking. There are a thousand examples I could use but I'll go with something quite frivolous. 
Last weekend it was Mother's Day. I have 4 kids. 3 to my ex husband and a new baby to my partner of 7 years. The older kids got me a gift while they were at their dads which meant apparently the partner didn't have to bother. I didn't get a card and tbh a card with all 4 of my kids names on would have been nice. So I'm thinking I usually get him a Father's Day card and gift off the older kids but how would he feel if I just didn't? I mean this is his first Father's Day with a biological child, how hurt would he be if I just didn't bother the same way he didn't bother. I would just be doing it out of spite because I put everyone else's happiness before mine but yeah I want to feel like I'm being thought of. When he doesn't do these things it's not because he chooses not to but because the thought isn't there to begin with.  The saying ""it's the thought that counts"" is spot on. I just never feel thought of to begin with. Also managed to get him a valentines card just a week after an emergency section while my lo was still on nicu. I however didn't get anything yet again. I wish it was just me but he never sends his mum a card or even rings her for her birthday or Mother's Day. ",07Apr2019,1

I don’t like complementing myself either because it feels narcissistic to say I’m good at anything or I have some specific positive trait. Whenever someone compliments me it feels narcissistic to thank them because it feels like I’m jerking myself off by agreeing with the compliment.

69,"This last month or so has been quite different than the rest of my short university career and I can feel myself losing motivation to study, stopping to care (failed a few midterms), and being consumed by confusion and sleep.

To preface; I am an 18 y/o female who has never had a relationship or anything of the nature and never really had any interest in it. I’ve always just kind of assumed I am straight, never really looked to deep into it tho.

A little over a month ago A girl in my program (and basically all my classes) messaged me on Instagram asking about some school related stuff and  we ended up adding each other on Snapchat. Didn’t think much of it, everyone is friendly and wants to make new friend in uni plus I talk to one of her close friends quite a bit and we have all the same classes.  We snap chatted super casually quite a bit over the next few days just about our courses and university. She asked me to grab coffee after class one day and I figured why not, hadn’t really been thinking she meant in a date way (as I thought she was straight and it was super casual) but I did respond in a way that explicitly stressed the a friends dynamic, something like “yea I always like making new friends in my program”

The next day or so, My friend then told me that the girls friend had messaged my friend asking what my sexual orientation was to which my friend responded with that she didn’t really know (we had talked about guys before but my friend said she didn’t want to assume lol). The girls friend also told my friend that she thinks me and the girl are “talking talking” , I know this all sounds very highschool lol but my program very cliquey as we all have the same classes first year.

Anyway, I was a little concerned by this but talked to a few people and they all said that I have nothing to worry about as it’s not explicitly a date and it would be weird to assume it was one and cancel or something.

Anyway, we’ve hung out a few more times and snap chat a bunch and nothing really awkward or anything to indicate more than a friend ship happens when it’s just the two of us. 

So one night there was a party at a nightclub that a bunch of people from my university attended. The girl and her friends were going and I was between going to the club or another party with my friends. The girl messaged me around the time we were both pre-ing with our respective friend groups saying something like “please come to the club I really want to see you”. My friends and I decided to go to the club anyway for other reasons so I let her know and we planned to meet up there for a bit to say hi and what not. 

When I get there I let her know and her and her friends (who I’m also kind of friends with) come find us and we all hug and talk in true drunk girl fashion. A few moments later, our mutual friend who is VERY drunk, kind of hugs me and asks if I’m gay, it was pretty loud in the club so u had to get pretty close to hear and no one else could’ve heard. I was kinda caught off guard (not totally sober) and was like “what?” She asked again and i was like “what?” again as it was hard to hear and again caught off guard. She was like “I’ll take that as a no” and I was like “i dont know” and she was like “don’t tell her” and I was like “who is her” and she said the girls name. 

Drunk friend then tried to convince me to kiss the girl as she said the girl “really likes me”. I immediately told her no. She then told me like it’s okay to be bi and that she herself was bi and it feels so good and what not which was sweet but didn’t convince me to start kissing people out of the blue lol.  The drunk friend said she just wants her friend to be happy as why I should kiss the girl but I told her that I was not sober enough to be making decisions basically. The drunk friend was kind of disappointed but understood, said a drunk girl goodbye and moved on with the night. As the drunk friend was leaving she saw me and said goodbye and told me to promise I would kiss the girl that night which I told her no again she was disappointed but understood. The next day the drunk girl snapped me apologizing if she made things awkward, I told her she didn’t and it was all good. To be clear the girl I have been talking to didnt know this was going on so it was just between me and the drunk girl.

Yesterday, I went out with the girl and her friends (including drunk friend) and again nothing to indicate more than friends happened aside from the drunk girl whispering in my ear when she hugged me “make a move”

So, ever since my first conversation at the club I have been considering everything, why my response to the “are you gay” question was “idk”. I have concluded that as I have never really done anything with a girl Or a guy I can’t conclude one way or the other. I think I also just didn’t want to be a buzz kill or hurt feelings in the moment. I’ve never really felt attracted to a girl before, however, I can’t say I have felt super attracted to guys either, I can see myself with a guy but I’m not sure about a girl... and I really like the girl I am talking to as a friend for sure, idk if more than a friend ¿ I just don’t know if I could be with a girl ,,, I’ve never thought about it before all this and given my lack of experience it often sends me spiraling into deep thought and consideration it’s tearing me apart . I don’t want to lead her on but I don’t want to just ignore her as I do value our friendship (I guess that’s what it is right now) 

I really don’t know what to do, I have no idea how to know what I want, I don’t want to ruin any friendships, and I fear as the semester is ending soon and we will all disperse for the summer something might happen before then that will force me to choose. And I really just can’t right now , I just don’t know what I want, and I liked not needing to know. This and my school work has just consumed me making me so sad and unmotivated , 

I don’t really want to talk to any of my friends about this but thinking maybe I should have a sober conversation with the drunk mutual friend who has kind of instigated this 

I don’t expect anyone to have read all that, I just find writing it all out is somewhat the therapeutic.

The simplicity of his lyrics on top of all the thick jazz chords he uses make everything come together in such a great way. They arrange very well on guitar as well. They don't sound like children's songs. They're so fun and so wholesome. I wish the whole world could hear them, but I feel like there is no market for simple, wholesome music. Everyone I talk to seems to think that if music I wholesome, it's automatically childish. So I sing to my wife, and we have loads of wholesome fun, but I wish I could share it with more people.

75,"I am a college senior geek put up in another state for a debate league tournament.

This morning I woke up bright and early, at 6 am to shower and get ready for the day. Excited to go sight seeing and start the day, I stripped off my pajamas, dropped my boxers to the floor and rushed into the bathroom.

And then, as soon as I realized my mistake, my bald, bare, plump white buttcheeks felt the unforgiving, ice cold wood of the door slam against them.

I was locked out of my room, into the hallway of a hotel, naked.

As if this wasn't a nightmare already, it was freezing. The heat hadn't kicked on yet .

My short, 5'7 frame standing there with eyes wide and mouth open in pure shock and panic. Totally untanned from the neck down. Not fat, but an embarrassing, round ""Freshman 15"" belly that I hide with large shirts. An embarrassing, round ""bubble butt"" that my friend Ashley always jokes that I'm ""hiding"" under my ""nerdy khakis"" jiggling defenselessly behind me as I futilely tried the door knob.

And my hand clamped over my small penis and balls. Obviously a virgin.

15 minutes later, after sprinting down the hallway for the ice cold stairwell (even colder than the hallway!!!) and running down 12 (twelve!!!) flights of stairs in my birthday suit with my hands holding my balls for dear life, I stood buck naked in the lobby for the world to see and talked to a cute 20-something front desk girl who didn't even try to hide her laughter at my retreating, bouncing bare ass disappearing into the stairwell when she gave me a keycard.

And after again running up the stairs, running nude for all to see down the hallway, I passed by a mid-40's year old woman who said ""WOOOO!"" as leaned back and SMACKED my naked butt as I ran past her.

I was back in my room, in my warm PJs and stood indoors all day.

The next day, I got a call from my professor to back up and go home. Said that the mid-40's woman who smacked my tush laughed as she told the security guy that I was streaking. He didn't find it funny, told the school, and I got kicked out.

Despite that, I don't at all suffer from stage fright, or any unusual amount of fear of public speaking. My guess is that this falls under social anxiety, but I don't know.

81,"So I walked inside and there’s this older guy that’s leaning in super close to my friend at the bar and you can tell they were having an argument. So I walked up and heard him making fun of her and calling her “Paris Hilton” etc etc. she was clearly uncomfortable so I stepped in between them to create distance and sign my receipt. At that point he grabbed my arm, which pissed me off so I got mad and told him he had to leave. After a brief argument he did. “Ok creepy guy, glad he’s gone,” I thought.

Then my friend kept repeating “yeah that creepy BLACK guy.” I’m just not understanding why she kept insisting on saying and emphasizing his color.

Then some other white dude walked up and said something along the lines of “yeah you could tell by the look of him that he would be a creep.” “You can see what he is.” Which pissed me off because the whole situation starting to have a super heavy racial undertone. And when I asked the guy wtf that was supposed to mean he said “no cuz he was like old and creepy.”

So NOW I’m wondering if my friend was just being a drunk racist bitch before I came in and was treating the man poorly for no reason. So that pissed him off which was why he was calling her a basic white girl. And I came in and immediately got mad at him and told him to leave :/

**TLDR** \- &gt;!Smile, please this is not happy story!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

Hello everyone, I would like to share with you an unpleasant story from my life (maybe more from the last 10 years) that will not have a happy ending.

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize for style, but I am neither a writer nor English is not my native language.For a very long time I thought to write my stories so that everyone could read it.

I didn't want to throw it on Christmas or the new year, to not disturb anyone this time, the more so once again that I wanted to try to smile at the recipient of Secret Santa.

I didn’t want to throw it in the vicinity of my birthday in the same way. Today, when I have less and less strength and prospects for a better tomorrow, I think it's the last call for it.

Forgive for long and boring introduction

Time to say something about me, I am already a rather old man (as much as 30 years old) from a country in Europe, maybe some of you will infer from which, for now living in the capital city.

A series of worse and worse misfortunes began perversely from the trip during which I said "" from now everything will be fine, no worries""

If I knew how much that’s words were stupid.

Two days from these words I participated in a car accident, which is interesting then I experienced my only fracture - eye socket, from stories I know that the surgery lasted for many hours and the exhausted doctor told my mother that life was saved. Well, I spent two weeks in the hospital. Then a month at home where my only exit was a trip to the hospital on medical examination

I don't recommend this condition and anabolics after which there are various strange dreams: /I survived, I feel the effects to this day but it is not a tragedy.After the accident, I came back to university, I even got to the next ones, but I did not start the same as I did not finish the first ones even though it only one exam. left.

You'll probably ask why?

Well, after the accident, my relationship with one person important to me broke down. But something else happened. Something no one expected.The house that my great-grandfather built in the 1950s, in which my grandfather lived (unfortunately died in 2012, through stress and these situation ), mother and I have been living since birth.

Unfortunately, due to the history and the very behavior of my country and the city. Our house for which we have always looked after, we've done renovations, we have brought water from a well, or electricity has been given to ""alleged owners"". Without our knowledge or any question in very unclear circumstances, maybe even breaking the law, but who cares? We just got an enigmatic letter and so much silence.It was in 2011 and later we will come back to this.

Due to lack of money, I decided to take up full-time jobs (previously I worked while studying on weekends). In college, I could not focus even though I tried : / unfortunately I was alone without any support.

In 2012, I started working in a company as it seemed to me very good and where I would grow. The more so because we cooperated for a giant in the industry. And my contribution from the very beginning was continuous and required a huge amount of time. What exactly happened at the time because I did not have to think about problems and that I worked 12-14 hours a day or on weekends? I worked and enjoyed it.

Well, but how could this idyll not last because it would be too beautiful. After 3 years, I was released. From day to day. On Saturday night I came back from a business trip and on Monday after working hours I got information ""end of work""It is also like no tragedy, right? True, if not a small detail.

From the beginning of 2015, they were receiving a payment for me. Previously, there were only delays. You know 5-10 days. No problem. I am a conciliatory man and I'm not brawling.Unfortunately, for 6 withdrawals I received only 2 and no money for overtime.I asked, I asked. It did not do anything. Unfortunately, I was forced to go to the orchard. Despite my reasons and the huge amount of evidence, I was afraid. And you know what? Rightly.

The case went on for a long time. I am alone without a lawyer. Because as you know - ""no money = no lawyer""The result of the matter is absurd and negative. My loss despite presenting a lot of evidence and challenging one, only one! proof of the other party which was my signature which does not look like mine at all : /And so the injured person became even more vulnerable because the system does not defend the weaker. And I lost a large amount of money. Which I lose hope that I will recover.

Let's go back to 2014, when the new ""owners"" of our house demanded money. The amount is not small again. Of course, neither courts nor authorities, despite requests and presenting their reasons, do not want to help. Because why help people like us.

The whole situation will probably end up landing on the street ☹ ☹ without money or other means of livelihood.Dear ones, the above situations have meant that I have not been sleeping well for many years. I also think that depression begins to get on me more and more.

Because it would not be too colorful, it's not the only thing that touched me.A few years back it turned out that my mother has sick kidneys: / Even very, stage 3 or 4. Such irony because we have too easy in life. Mom is already years old and has to take great care of herself. Unfortunately, constant stress is not easy. And I cannot lie saying that everything will be fine. Because I see that it is notIf you were wondering about one thing. Yes, I work I earn, unfortunately, the amount is way too small. And when I think that I will be without everything with unjust debts. I think that this life does not make any sense. Even work, because you know how to work only to give away EVERYTHING . evil and degrading perspective ☹. This is a damn bad and a downward perspective ☹.

Just as it was depressing that a person, a woman whom I loved more than a life after more than 2 years, decided that someone like me - poor, without money, father, no fact decided to add that ugly fat and stupid;\];\] is completely nothing worth. I loved her very much, she knew it perfectly well, she also thought of me, but who knows? Since she lied to me on many issues because she liked her so much and wanted to be always the center of attention. Honestly, when I was not alone, I felt some support that gave me strength. And now? I have nothing and nobody. After all those years….It's stupid to say, but I'm afraid that if someone needed help, I'd be the first to help. So maybe she went right with my stupidity?

I'm afraid every day, because everyone can bring something worse than the previous one. I do not have the strength to look after others like I used to. I will not give myself because I have neither strength nor strength. (you know the treatment costs too)I did not think that he would write something like that from his heart. Maybe a bit chaotic but how true.

At the end, for those who have read all this, I would like to apologize for taking their time, but also to thank.

I also want it while it still lives and have any strength to say that if any of you have any problems, need to talk to someone, my inbox is open to you.

I have always been a good and empathic listener thanks to which I managed to help me somehow. Because if for me there is no rescue from these hopeless situations, at least I will try to help.

91,"I've been crying for hours. I stop, then start again, then stop, rinse repeat. My head is killing me.

I feel hopeless, like nothing I do is enough. I've become so closed off - social interactions exhaust me and I dread going to this course because it means being around people. I used to be such a happy, loving, friendly and chatty girl but it feels like slowly I'm losing who I used to be and instead have become nothing but a shell of who I was.
I want to push everyone in my life away. I don't want to talk to anyone, I don't want to continue telling people that I feel like shit. I have friends, but I'm tired of disappointing them. My family already are, as recently my father told me nothing I'd done in almost 24 years really mattered. I haven't been able to finish my degree yet - and I've worked but that was back in another country and it doesn't matter back home. I've lost the place I used to call home for 6 years of my life, now back to a small village in the other side of the world where I've nothing - no job, partner or independence. I feel worthless even though I fight that feeling every day.

I'm trying to support my ex through his much needed changes, but I'm struggling to. He wants me to be honest but I feel rejected when I am. He introduced me as his friend to one of his mates online today - it broke me. He didn't understand and told me he didn't mean it in any way, but hearing those words right now just sent me down a dark place. I know it's such a menial thing, I really do, but I've just wanted him to tell me so many things he told me when he was struggling, like that he misses me, cares about me or that he'd like to see me. That he meant it when he said he wanted me to be happy, and be the one to do it. That I am not just a memory, I am the only one.
 But nothing ever happens, unless he's at a low point. I feel loved, and that he acknowledges my efforts, only when he's down. I know he's trying to improve himself and I don't want to hinder that at all, he wants me in his life yet I feel like I'm only there for the ride. I want to feel  special. I want something in my life to go right, you know?

I'm not sure if this is just another one of those long dark trips depression likes to put me in. I forced myself out yesterday on my own - I hated it, but a friend was very proud of me. And hearing those words made me feel like crying. ""I'm proud of you for doing that"" ""I'm proud of you for pushing through this really dark time"" ""I'm proud of you for pushing that anxiety aside and doing something uncomfortable, even if it turned out shit"".
I want to hear those words so badly, mainly from my family. ""I'm proud of you"". But I know they'll never come.
My ex told me them too - then promptly told me he had to go to bed, in a way it sort of felt disingenuous even though I'm sure it wasn't.

I'm such an emotional wreck and I hate it. I'm a disappointment and a bother, and I feel like nothing I do will ever change that. Hell, I couldn't keep a lot of friends or even my partner happy. It's no wonder my parents are disappointed.",07Apr2019,1
92," Throw away; cause reasons.

I'm a relatively successful person; not seasoned by any means, but on my way. I graduated University just over 2 years ago. I make a good salary and, I'm in a position most of my graduating class would die for. I have 2 wonderful young kids and a lovely wife.

I often wonder if they'd be better off without me.

But legitimately; I'm an asshole from time-to-time. I espouse discipline before everything else and my expectations are disproportionate. I just blew up at my oldest because he called me ""the meanest daddy"". I had just told him for the fifth time to clean up his toys in as many minutes. I was stern but not angry. He threw this little tidbit at me and I blew a gasket. Some hot, fiery bullshit spewed from my mouth like a truck horn, ""You think I'm mean? I'll show you a mean daddy: pick up your damn toys, and get into your room!"" I mean, this isn't like an ""!"" for flavor, I literally shouted at my child like I was going to war with him.

Now you may be thinking that maybe I deserve a pass; I don't. My oldest is 3. He is 3 fucking years old.

My wife obviously heard this and sought to chill me out a bit. She wasn't rude about it, she was trying to be constructive. With a more level headed person, it would have been. Instead, I gas-lighted her; hard. Without being too long winded, I got pissed about not feeling appreciated and constantly being criticized by her. Twasn't cool.

I've been in our bedroom sulking. I texted an apology to her because I don't have the cahones to do it face-to-face. I'm honestly trying to be the best person I can be and, I try to be stoic under pressure but, it feels like I'm ultimately failing to provide the financial, emotional, and mental bedrock my family needs without the stress breaking me. It just feels like I'm not meant to be a husband/father.

I often wonder if they'd be better off with me dead.

Seriously though, I think about it this way: if I were to die in some tragic accident, they'd get a decent life insurance policy pay out, the kids are still young enough to forget about the absolute tool I can be. Still young enough for them to see a real father in a new man who could come into their lives. My wife would be heart-broken, I think, for a time. But it would pass; statistically, people move on after a spouse's death sooner than they do a divorce. Not to mention, there'd be less of a stigma on her. And once the next guy knows much of anything about my antics as a ""father,"" he really wouldn't have much concern about measuring up to the ""perfect dead guy.""

I'm a walking hypocrite. I espouse discipline. ""Get it done"" type mentality. ""Work isn't always fun, that doesn't mean you don't have to do it""; ""getting up early and making your bed in the morning isn't that big of a deal but it makes all the difference""; ""your word is your bond""; ""follow through""; ""be there""; crap like that. I've come to realize something from my wife though:

""Chronic Kindness is Discipline's Pinnacle"".

If you can be kind to the people who hate you but, also kind toward the people you hate, if you can be kind despite the pressures in your life, if you can be kind regardless of how you may feel from moment to moment, THEN discipline is a trait you can truly claim. I feel very far from that.

I feel like my personality is the equivalent of sugar; in small doses, it's a good thing to have, fun even. But if you have it constantly, it will kill you slowly.

I know this about myself; I seem unable to change it; it's killing me slowly.

TL;DR

I'm an asshole and it sucks.

two years ago, i ended a very abusive relationship. i was convinced that i would never find love again, and the idea of dating scared me. all of that changed, however, when i met my now ex-boyfriend. he was an amazing individual who had sparked a connection from the first time we met. we spoke to each other every day and were both too shy to admit our feelings to each other. we finally did so in june of 2018 and began the best relationship of my life. everything was great: we never fought, we were always happy. there was one setback, which was that he was currently in another country. i wasn't a stranger to ldrs, and i was determined to make it work. he booked tickets to come visit me, and i booked tickets to go visit him. it worked out. 

i suffer with a lot of kidney issues and spent the majority of the summer into the fall in the hospital. he was by my side every single time and never made it seem like i was a bother. in february, my mental health began to take a toll after an upsetting diagnosis. he has suffered from depression previously, and he was very understanding. however, things started to change in march. he began to distance himself from me and ignore me for hours on end. every time i had messaged him, he would reply hours later saying he 'didn't see the message.' we went from talking and seeing each other almost everyday to not speaking at all. we had a falling out after he had told me why he was distancing himself from me, but we had agreed that we would try to work on our relationship, because we both love each other so much. things were getting better and the old relationship we once had was finally coming back.

on friday night, we facetimed and everything seemed fine. i went to sleep and woke up on saturday to harsh messages from a mutual friend. she had called me mentally ill, expressed that she doubted my health issues, and told me that my relationship was never going to work. confused, i went to message my boyfriend, only to find out that he had blocked me everywhere out of the blue. it turns out that he had told this person about all of my mental health setbacks and family problems i had been dealing with since the new year started. 

i have a lot of unanswered questions. i'm struggling mentally as it is due to some unfortunate events in my life that he knew about. i had spent 9 months with this man, who i considered to be the love of my life. to be cut off with no explanation hurts like hell. i feel absolutely devastated, and i'm finding it hard to go through the days. 

if anything, i'm looking for advice on how to deal with the sudden loss, and how to move on with myself.

However, he's been making it increasingly difficult for me to move in with him. I am frustrated and need some advice. First of all, I really want to find an apartment in Batavia or Geneva, IL. However, it has to be an apartment in the DuPage County area. My friend is required by law to live in DuPage County, due to a recent incident with his mental health and court (he didn't go into full detail).

Later on, he then updated me and told me it's going to be hard for me to move in with him anyway, because of his bad background with trespassing. He also recently got fired from Uber because they did a background check, so yeah...you can see where I'm going with this.

Just last week, when I told him I've decided to look for one bedroom apartments, he got mad at me and now thinks I don't want to move in with him. He actually seemed kind of hurt, but I didn't mean it that way at all. It's just very frustrating because I feel so limited in my apartment search, due to his poor choices and shady background. Researching and moving into a one bedroom apartment would give me more freedom to choose, but I don't want to put a rift in my friendship if he feels like I'm rejecting him.

I did explain to him my reason for researching one bedroom apartments instead, the fact that it'll be harder to move in with him and all that.

99,"This is my first post and I'm not entirely sure what to say or do, I'm just winging it. Sorry if there is a bit of waffling.

&amp;#x200B;

My name is Adam, and I'm currently 18 (19 in September) and I'm currently homeless.

  
Let's start from the beginning.

Since I was born, I used to live in a small-ish house in a town called Middlesbrough, until I moved when I was about 7 - because of this I ended up changing primary schools.

I ended up leaving behind the life that I used to remember as happy and filled with company.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents ended up moving to my grandparents old house (they live in a flat next to that house now) and it is a farm house with a lot of land, but it is quite rural since I live far away from the nearest village/town. Let's call this house A.

&amp;#x200B;

I enjoyed primary school for the most part, it was easy (I was regarded a genius) and I made a lot of friends, but around the age of 9/10, I ended up hitting puberty and I ended up getting outcasted due to my weird jokes/reactions.

&amp;#x200B;

After primary school, the secondary school (11-16 years old) I went to was essentially a new start because I started going to a school in Middlesbrough (a decent way away from House A) so I did not know anybody, but I ended up getting bullied and outcasted (for the most part) there too. I got bullied verbally, getting called a freak, pervert, paedophile etc on a daily basis but I never acted out, I tried to remain happy but I ended up developing depression at about the age of 12/13 and started to go up to my room everyday and not communicate with anybody other than my friends that I would make online on Minecraft. 

&amp;#x200B;

Due to all of this happening along with puberty, I ended up arguing a lot with my parents, and my mum would call me many things such as: a psychopath, an asshole, a sociopath, a faggot and loner, along with other things I do not want remember. She would also say things like ""no wonder you get bullied"" and she ended up having depression too later on into her life due to health issues and the such. Since then, I never truly interacted properly with my family and had some kind of depression at home or an isolating feeling of never wanting to leave my room.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes, I would act out and end up breaking down mentally and end up getting furious and maybe running away from home or start fighting. I resorted to game addiction to numb the pain. Through time and my own efforts, I battled depression with all I had whilst getting advice/company off friends. I was not the best friend but now I strive to be a better person (I still have somewhat major loneliness issues and periodic isolation though).

&amp;#x200B;

Now comes college, I am borderline 17 and I now can have more freedom and responsibility. Cars, bank cards, I could have it all, but I didn't have many friends in college due to not connecting well with people due to lack of social experience and conduct. I tried to apply for my driving licence but I never got my provisional, so I gave up on that early, and I never ended up getting a bank account. 

My grades are not amazing in college (A/A\* for maths, B for physics and an E-ish for Further Maths) and I didn't study much during my first year due to not knowing how to study/depression or being unable to study at home due to the environment. I am applying for university this year and I'm a bit worried about my Further Maths grade.

&amp;#x200B;

With time, my dad ended up getting more and more negative towards me, saying that it was of me going on my  ""fucking stupid laptop"" that I'm failing, and that I was going to be a failure, or fail at life, and that I was an idiot etc, just generally being verbally abusive on a daily basis. Sometimes my mother would do this too. My parents got more and more stressed and essentially took it out on me. I know they want the best for me in some shape or form, but my parents are generally very harsh if you do anything that they don't want you to do, and end up berating you and saying that they are always right. I only remember 1/2 times that my mother apologised in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up getting very stressed a lot of the time in the second year of college, I started staying behind until 6pm and getting home at about 7pm (I usually am heading to college and getting home from 8am-7pm) every day doing work and generally avoiding home. Due to this stress, I got very forgetful and unstable at times.

&amp;#x200B;

So, 3 weeks ago, I fell asleep on a bed without a bed cover and without taking off my shirt because it was cold and I was tired (had pyjama bottoms on). My mother came into my room on the following morning and started saying that I was disgusting and that only dirty scum would sleep in clothes.

Went to college, came back at 7pm, same thing from my father. Later on I forgot to take a pile of clothes through to my room, my father unloaded onto me and started saying that I was a ""fucking idiot"" and that I was ""wasting my life"" and that I was ""useless"", I argued back and he told me to pack my bags and leave, which I did. He tried to get my laptop and phone saying that was his, I replied with ""Where is the receipt"". Nothing more was said.

&amp;#x200B;

A friend of mine said that I could stay around hers for a short while whilst I got things setup, but I realised how much I needed to do later on. I had to get a bank account, get universal credit, keep up with A-levels, get a house and the such as well as keep my mental state intact. It's been a hard situation. College has helped me come out of my shell a lot and develop me as an individual person as well as help me with advice and a bit of financial aid. I am on good (unstable) terms with my family and I feel a bit lonely at my friend's house because I sometimes feel a bit outcasted by their behaviour. I attempt to help them out and join in with their activities.

&amp;#x200B;

13 days ago, I asked if my nana would let me stay around hers and she said ""I don't think I want to because things might blow up"" and 11 days ago, midway my meeting for my homelessness, she called me and said I could stay. 7 days ago, she then said I couldn't stay around because I ""pestered"" her for internet (asked her twice, the second time after consulting my mum) so that I could sort my homelessness out and all of my stuff online as well as study more for my revision and have access to emails. So with that happening, I had less time to sort things out. I believe I have emotional trauma at House A and I do not feel safe/secure there.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother and I spoke 4 days ago and she kept taking digs at me (don't remember what) and I remember telling her that I don't want to argue. She said that ""I have money and a family who cares about me, you have nothing"", ""You don't have any respect for anybody"", and that I should think about others more rather than being selfish. She also told me that being kicked out was a choice.

&amp;#x200B;

With that being said, tomorrow I'm getting emergency accomodation until I can get a home sorted out. I don't have a source of income and I cannot apply for universal credit without a bank account (which I am also getting tomorrow).

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully I can come through this alive and happy :)

&amp;#x200B;

If you look at MMA or boxing, there are weight categories in order to make the fights fair because it’s quite obvious that being much bigger than your opponent is going to give you an unfair advantage and skills will not come into play as much unless both fighters have similar body types. In a lot of high level sports like tennis, basketball or football there is also a separation between men and women, again to make competition more fair. However, there is no separation when it comes to high level sports such as basketball or volleyball for the same sex. In those sports, height means everything, in the same way that weight is very important in combat sports. Unfortunately, if you have the misfortune as a man or a woman to have been born smaller than average or even just be average height, you have almost zero chance of reaching the highest level of competition because you will compete will people so much taller than you that it will be like kids fighting against adults.  

What this means is that most people can’t dream of playing these sports at very high level because hard work will never compensate for lack of height at very competitive levels of play.  

Now if there were height categories, for example: basketball but only for people under 6 feet, you could have a fair competition where all those smaller people get a chance to reach high levels of play. Right now, unless you’re in the top 5% of the tallest people, you wouldn’t stand a chance of playing at national caliber unless you have incredible talent, which would only make you an average player.  

There is so much untapped talents in sports that I believe basketball or volleyball played at olympic levels would be just as thrilling to watch if there was height categories.

Right now, just being very tall will make people tell you that you should seriously consider playing sports where height is important while smaller, very motivated people will hear that maybe they should find another sport they like, which I think is quite sad since you’re cutting them off from playing the sport seriously only because of how the current system is buit.

Would it be too unrealistic to think that such a separation could be made or would it require too much effort and make things too complicated? I want to hear your thoughts.",07Apr2019,1

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I loved cars since i was a little kid. 

Most of my toys were die-cast cars, i played a lot of racing games (still do, tbh), i bought books and journals about cars , watched TV shows, F1 broadcasts and so on and so forth. 

I don't even know why i had/have such a profound passion in cars. No one in my family was working with cars or owned a car and whatnot. But i was going bananas over cars. Always dreamed of being an engineer, who builds sports cars or even racecars. Cars that would win tournaments. Wanting to become a new Colin Chapman, Gordon Murray, you name it.

School starts. Was doing quite good in it. Then, at around 9th grade (we study 11 grades in my home country) parents told me that in near future i'll be attending university and it's time for you to decide what field do you want to study to build your career on after.

The answer was simple for me: Automotive Engineering. But there was a downside: no university in my country taught automotive engineering and studying abroad wasn't an option at that moment, because my father's salary wasn't sufficient enough to afford it

Not gonna lie, i felt sad about it. But i accepted it, because my parents were already doing more than enough to sponsor my education (private tutors on subjects i had difficulties with etc.) and the best way i could show my gratitude was to try and study different field. So I decided to study in IT

Two years passed, i finished school, passed the university entry exams (preparation to them was a huge stress in itself, but that's a story for another day) and went to the IT faculty. I heard a lot of stories about how education system in my country is in a very bad state and that getting your degree here isn't a good option on a long-term basis, but for some reason i brushed it off like ""it will be different here""

It wasn't. It was as bad as i heard it was. Teachers barely taught us anything and even the things they taught us either had no relation towards IT or were very outdated. We studied programming on Visual Basic 6.0. Visual bloody Basic! I can't think of any modern software/app/website that even uses Visual Basic, and yet we are studying this instead of C++ or Java or anything more relevant than Visual Basic 6.0. Even that we studied barely and never done anything more complex than a simple calculator. Disaster

Also, despite being sort of a techy guy (i rarely have problems assembling/disassembling or fixing stuff), i quickly realized that IT wasn't really my thing. Don't get me wrong, I understand computers, I even worked as sort of a free-lance maintenance guy, fixing people's laptops and whatnot for a quick buck. But I didn't really feel that it was a field i could commit to for the rest of my life, know what I am saying?

One evening my mother noticed me being upset, asked what's up. I explained her the situation.

She then told me a story from her life: she was really good with languages when she was younger, but at some point she thought that she wouldn't earn as much being a foreign language teacher, and with the advice from her relatives, she decided to become a doctor (to be fair, she was raised in Soviet Union, and there even a simple therapist earned more than a typical school teacher, let alone if you are, for example, a surgeon, so it seemed like a reasonable choice). She failed the university entry exam twice (both times due to random bullshit), had to go to Biology faculty (which was pretty much a step down from a Medical), got her degree, worked as a teacher a bit, and then retired due to being pregnant with me (i am the only child in the family). She told me that she regrets the decision of trying to become a doctor instead of going for something she actually enjoyed and was very good at and she told me to go for the thing i enjoy doing, no matter the outcome or the possible circumstances...

At that moment i decided: i **will** study automotive engineering.

First, we searched for the possible opportunities to study abroad. By that time my father found a new job and almost doubled on his previous salary, so we could look for options. But my father's salary still wasn't that big (i am from a slightly above average family by local standards) so options like USA and UK with over 30k dollars for study *only* (not including the living costs etc) were off the list pretty much immediately. As the time went on, more and more options went off our list, since my country isn't in EU, and most of the EU-based universities have vastly higher tuition fees for non-EU citizens compared to EU citizens (for example: a university in Netherlands asked 2k dollars per year if you were from EU and almost 9k per year if not from EU). I didn't want to study in Eastern Europe either because from what i heard, the education wasn't vastly better compared to my country. And at the end only one option was left: Germany

In Germany, most of the, let's call them ""state-funded"" universities don't have any tuition fees. Living costs weren't that wild as well. Sure, more expensive than in my homeland, but manageable for us. The quality of education wasn't even a concern. Automotive engineering in Germany: it can't really get any better than that, can it?

Only one thing: pretty much in all Bachelor-degree studies, German language proficiency is mandatory (it must be proofed by exam certificate). I am very good with English, but knew literally zero German.

But it was an opportunity. An opportunity to study automotive engineering, an opportunity i could not let pass, so i started to learn German

Oh boy, was it a struggle. Knowing a language well enough to speak it is one thing. Knowing a language well enough to *pass an exam* is completely different. I've spent almost 3 years, learning and honing my German skills. I had 6 hand-written notebooks filled with words and their translations. Lots of books, audio-books, all kinds of learning material. If it was in German, you'd be damn sure I read it. Literally anything, from news articles up to stuff written on the back of shampoos imported from Germany. I was that committed to the cause

I took up the exam 4 times in the span of 2 years (for the record, they aren't held as often as IELTS exams are). Last two times i was 1 point short of the required score. 1 point. Two times in a row. Both times i filed a request for reappraisal, and both times i was told that the score won't be changed. No need to explain that this was a *very* depressing experience.

Another exam. 5th time. Felt oddly calm during the exam (usually i get somewhat nervous before exams) so i thought along the lines of ""maybe this is the one"", having high hopes for it.

Results came in after 6 weeks. 1 point short. Again. Third time in a row. I was actually crying at that point. I'm sure if it wasn't for my parents' and friends' support, i'd have a mental breakdown or smth.

So i filed pretty much a throwaway request for reappraisal and, well, by that time i already graduated from my university, got my degree and was pretty much a NEET at that point. It was summer/early autumn, so i was just spending it with my friends and family, travelled abroad for the first time (spent a week in Moscow), enjoying myself basically. And at that point i kinda thought ""Maybe, i can live my life without it?"". I am also lucky to have very loyal friends that would go through fire with me if it is necessary, so i thought it would be all good here. Close to friends, close to family, etc. You know what i mean...

Until the reappraisal results came in a month later...

They added one point to my final score.

The one point i was lacking from the score requested by German universities.

I think i was one of the happiest people on the Earth at that moment. I was driving home in a bus when i got the email, and i was grinning like a creep. I probably got stares from other passengers at that moment, but honestly, i couldn't give two shits about it. An hour later i was celebrating it with my friends like we just launched a rocket to Mars. It was wild.

Next half a year was full of paperwork routine: getting the required documents, sending it to universities, applying for the visa, waiting for the responses, settling the inconveniences occurring along the way. These were quite stressful by themselves, since i was running on a very tight deadline dates schedule. But at the end, i did it

I am now studying Automotive Engineering, in Germany, on my 1st semester. It is exactly as i thought it would be, and even better in some aspects: everything we learn is related to the field (no nonsense from my first Uni), teachers are cool and very proficient at their subjects, and in future semesters most of the subjects will involve a lot of practical lessons (which i very like). But the biggest shock for me was that my university has its ***own student racing team***, where they're building race cars and taking part in events across Europe. I applied the first week, and i was accepted. Should i really say at this point that i am enjoying every bloody second of it? Unbelievable stuff. Still can't wrap my head around how much my life has changed in literally couple of months

For some reason, I really wanted to write my story down, because i thought that it might help someone who is at struggle. 

Motivate someone who has no strength left. 

Inspire someone who is seeking for his purpose. 

That no matter the odds, you must always follow your dreams. 

Try everything to achieve it. No matter how many times you fail, to try again.

 Because hard work, determination and hope will always pay off. 

Because at the end, when you will be doing something you enjoy, you'll know you made the right decision

115,"I feel like fantasies are really ruining my ability to be in the real moments and who the person really is?

I have a crush on a guy, but because I was so conscious I liked him, I was choking up and seriously overthinking. With too much time to think ahead my brain went crazy. I started imagining scenarios and imagining if he was rly my boyfriend and blahhh.

The first time I spoke to him, he was asking me so many questions and I walked away like ""wow was he interested?"" He seemed impressed by my job (we're both creative) in the kind of way that it's played out when guys have liked me in the past. I'm not usually wrong :( It really seemed that way.

The next time I saw him, I had built it up in my head too much. A couple things I had really PLANNED to say. I was anticipating what he would ask me (he DID) but I had these stupid answers in my head that I'm worried came off weird/fake because they were so rehearsed. I started getting really sarcastic because I was nervous. If you don't know me well, it's easy to take me seriously and I confused him a couple of times. And he probs didnt know I was joking about something which would have made me look silly.

I dont know if I also held back too much. I keep feeling like I should look like I’m living my life, so I didnt want to be constantly going up to him. It's not like he did to me. But what if I gave the impression that I was just talking that way to anyone cause I was mingling a lot anyway?

I told a male friend in passing that I liked the guy (maybe even only implying that I wanted to hook up and trying to be all cool -\_-) and he went ""Oh I would love to be with a musician"" and rambled about it in a way which actually helped me feel better. Just knowing other people think that way. "" (Especially coming from this friend, cause he can be kind of sleazy yet talked more from a dating perspective) It's exactly what my brain was like going ""How cool would it be to have a MuSiCian BoyfFriend!!!"" But where do you draw the line? I feel like I get too far gone with the fantasy sometimes.

A big concern is why is a relationship so foreign to me? I've been single for so long and I feel I get more anxious the more times this happens but doesn't work out :(

It just spurs thoughts that a boyfriend some dream thing that couldn’t happen for me? I don’t know WHY I don’t think I’m worthy of having a boyfriend. How did it get like this?

TL;DR: I’m sick of the fantasies. I want something real for once. I hate hearing that people say ""put yourself out there"" cause I really do try. I think I latch onto things because I never like anyone much? I wish I could. But when there's someone I really do try. I just get so disappointed if it doesn't go anywhere. Because I keep thinking will this FINALLY be something.

Hey guys,

I’m a 21 years old college student in the US. I’m really stressed out about this exam tomorrow. But, adding to that stress, I’m worried about tonight.

My girlfriend and I have been going through one of those rough patches. We’re both college students taking heavy courseloads right now, and we’re long distance. Meaning we don’t get to call/FaceTime very often. We’ve also just been going trough a rough patch in our relationship - although admittedly I don’t know if there are any other causes besides the lack of contact.

She texted me today asking if we could talk tonight. I don’t know for sure, but I have a weird feeling it’s going to be to ask for a “break”, aka slow break-up. I’ve had mental health issue relating to studying - I have a nasty habit of work avoidance that I’ve been working over in therapy. I’ve even somewhat successful with my efforts so far, but stress of this breakup possibly happening is causing me to be unable to focus on studying at all. The exam is in a tough class and...yeah. I love my girlfriend a lot so losing her would absolutely destroy me.

My apologies if this is the wrong sub for this - if there’s a more appropriate place for this let me know and I’ll post there. 

Do any of you have any tips for dealing with stress like this? All advice welcome.

119,"Hello All.

In the Fall of 2017 I moved from my parents house in the suburbs into an off campus apartment with a friend I have known for the better part of six years and his four other friends that he met while living under university dormitory. When I was initially offered to live closer to campus I was ecstatic but was anxious due to the total number of tenants. As a disclosure I am an only child.


The lease to the apartment was signed in the towards the end of the Spring semester that year around the time finals were wrapping up perfect with enough time to hangout with my new friends and future roommates. We broke the ice got to know each other then later broke bread together. In the early stages of these new relationships I was beginning to  noticed a trend among the group. Everyone in the group intentionally makes an effort to get under the skin of the others. I will admit I joined in the typical mild harassment amongst roommates but the day came when the friend that initially invited me into the arrangement broke me through ridicule within the apartment group chat.


One afternoon I had company over the apartment. When it was time for him to leave as any courteous friend would do I walked him out to the front where he had his car parked. As a second disclosure I have a severe history of leaving the apartment without keys in hand. Walking my friend out to his car I made sure I left the door cracked open but did not have the though of needing my keys. I say my farewells hug my friend and then notice that the door is shut. By the time this specific lockout had occurred I must have had at least three lockouts a month for the past seven months. The first thought that came in my head was ""FK"". My friend also noticed the door shut. He didn't say anything till I said ""he is not going to let me in"", I am referencing 'he' as my friend of six years.


We paused on the front steps for a moment to fully grasp the severity of the situation. The company I had over that day is also long time friends with my friend of six years. I was not going to ask him to ask my roommate to let me in because to me that demonstrated weakness. We continued to stand there on the steps for the next few minutes when my parting company decided not to leave in his car just yet. He instead decided to meet a few other people on campus, a fifteen minute walk, and then to leave. He left me on the front steps and returned forty minutes later to discover me begging and knocking on the window to my apartment to be finally let in. My friend had no other choice but at that point to just get into his car and leave. The most touching part of that evening is that he did not leave me right away but decided to walk and come back to see how the situation has evolved. 


While I was locked out the only gear I had on me was my Apple Watch which was connected to my phone but located inside the apartment. Once my roommate noticed that I was locked out he then noticed that I had left my keys along with my phone inside the apartment he then began to ridicule me within the apartment chat saying, ""the best part is he left his phone"". As an millennial there is not one day I would ever leave my phone behind if I was intentionally leaving the premisses indefinitely. I watched the thread of messages flow from my iPhone to my watch while hopeless outside.


I was let back into the apartment shortly after my friend drove off. For the rest of that night I was generally pissed off but do not have the quality of raising my voice, I guess that is an attribute of Only-Child-Syndrome. By the next morning I was over it, or so I had thought I was. To be honest this incident of trying to get under my skin is subpar to the time the same best friend of six years convinced me that he threw my Juul away in the trash can. I was picking off the top garbage to find it when I noticed I was being recorded. I was in a fit of tears. I tried to grab his phone to delete it, I did not succeed as he is a TKD disciplined champion.


Later that night he sent a text message apologizing for the Juul incident but the humility had already been taken in the presence of all the roommates while I was digging. I would have rather preferred a verbal apology but am content that I got one in the first place. 


The lesson my TKD roommate was trying to teach me is to always be prepared with keys. The second lesson he was trying to teach me is that I became addicted to nicotine even though I do not smoke cigs. Fast forward one year TKD roommate has a Juul and claims it helps him cut weight while it is tournament season. He never smoked cigs prior.


Now it is towards the end of the second semester of us all living together. I return back to my room and see on the top of my bed one inch monkey figurines in the shape of a happy face. Initially I am happy that my roommates would do something nice for me. I take a picture and caption it ""Cute"". The reply I get from my TDK roommate ""Oh honey"". I continue on with my normal business in my room when I discover more, and more, and more of these moneys everywhere. In the drawers of my desk, my sock drawer, and my boxers drawer. I became enraged but have kept it contained. I was forced to keep my door open as the guest bathroom was defaulted upon me. Keeping my door open leads to the implied trust of privacy that should exist. What if I had a giant dildo in one of those drawers and was still in the closet. They would have taken that innocence away. 


The only time I ever mentioned of this monkey situation is when I said it's ""Cute"". 


What is the lesson to be learned in this monkey situation here? That I had placed my trust in the wrong people?

&amp;#x200B;

At one point over the Summer I unjustifiably began to start ignoring my TKD friend when he would ask a typical apartment lease related question of which I held the responsibility to handle. In that moment I felt like he was nagging me to do my job when I knew what I had to do and when I had to do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

The ultimate error on my part is when he asked me why I am ignoring him I made up a bullshit excuse of him trying to kill me by leaving me stranded on the sidewalk of a North Philadelphia neighborhood as the sun was setting for forty minutes. When in reality was I still mad about the breach of trust due to the monkey situation. ",07Apr2019,3

124,"I [23F] know it sounds typical...like of course the answer is yes but there’s just nothing to do about it, it seems and I’m getting depressed. I’m in school, I’m working, I’m broke. I live with my awesome boyfriend in the house he bought, it’s a starter home, it’s great for a starter home. We have an awesome dog and everything is O.K. It’s just the things that make me happy I can’t do right now because I have no money. 

I am a homebody. My dream is to eventually graduate from Grad school and start my part time job, earning hours to get my LCSW and eventually start a private practice part-time, get married have babies and build a family and a home. This is my happiness. I love to fix up my home, but this isn’t my home yet technically and I don’t have the money to paint things or buy things to fix up the house. I wanna fix up the yard, but I don’t have the money to buy planters or flowers or dirt or anything. I want to to build a home and I can’t. I can’t buy new bed spreads or new curtains. I can’t buy new carpets or new silverware. 

This sounds so trivial but this is what makes me happy and I can’t do anything that makes me happy. I can’t go out and do anything I enjoy on my own because I can’t afford it. I’m just stuck being broke unable to leave the house to do anything besides school and work... Life is so dull and I know there’s so much out there and so much to experience but not having money has just always brought me down and left me stuck. So ready to start working a real job and making money so that I can do the things I want to do. I’m going on year 6 now of living like this and I swear I don’t know how I am going to get through it.

I was with that person in a clothing store and I was wondering out loud, what my size was again. He whipped his phone out and said he'll check.

126,"Whether it's makeup, nails, skincare, fashion, haircare, or anything that exceeds the bare minimum of basic hygiene (which is a hassle in and of itself): I can't seem to grasp it. It can be interesting to see the different steps to take in applying makeup, as well as interesting color combinations and accessories on different outfits. At the end of the day, I'm still so far behind other women and couldn't pull myself together to save my life. I seriously feel like a little girl playing dress-up.

Did I mention that I have short hair? Like, painfully short: to the point where I look like a boy. I've been trying to grow it back out for the past two years, and it still looks bad. I'm trying to be patient, and yet I still can't help but want long (or at least shoulder-length) hair to put up in cute styles. My short hair makes my face more unflattering than what it is, and I can't help but feel like less of a woman because of it.

While I'm trying to stay optimistic and motivated, it seems like more of a chore than anything. It doesn't help that I have no friends or relatives to help me out with this, so this is a trial and error process that must be done alone. I know that I just want a natural/polished look in regards to makeup, and I would like to have a wider array of clothes and a better sense of style. It's just actually putting it all together that's the problem, as well as feeling self-conscious about my appearance.

I just don't feel like a woman. Granted, I know that I'm biologically female: it just doesn't seem like I have the mindset, mannerisms, and certainly not the appearance of one. I want to be more traditionally feminine, I want to look and feel attractive for once in my life. I just don't know where to start and how quickly I should go without burning myself out.

I'm kind of getting the hang of learning how to be an adult female even with my occasional frustration. It's still tedious, though it's kind of fun to find different images to use as inspiration for my ultimate goal. Overall, it just feels... meh.

I have a friend, who I share a lot in common with. We like the same things, etc etc. We’re really good friends, but there’s an issue.

I have a huge crush on her. She knows this, and has for a while.

This morning she asked me to move on, that she’d never care about me that way, and that it makes her uncomfortable.

This came to me like a bullet to the head. I was fine before she said this, even knowing I had no chance. But I didn’t know I was making her uncomfortable.

Honestly? It hurts. Giving up on my feelings for her would hurt. Keeping my feelings for her hurts. It’s the generic unrequited love feeling.

I’m very good at keeping my composure, and the only time I break it is on this throwaway account. 

I don’t know what to do, yet at the same time i know what I need to do. I need to move on. I don’t want to, but at the same time I desperately want to move on.

It sucks. I hate this. I wouldn’t wish this feeling on everyone.
