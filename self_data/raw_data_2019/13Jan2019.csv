“Chilly snowy night in Germany, had to take our family protector of the last 12 1/2 years on her last car ride and say goodbye. Pascha. Shiny black hair, the most expressive blue and brown eyes. Big white fangs. Instinctively and fiercely loyal. She was only 25lbs, but her bark would shake the house. You only needed to hear that once. Never needed to turn the alarms on. She would always place herself in a central location in the house. Always on watch, always aware. If you were shady, and not supposed to be in the house, she would show you her fangs and let you know immediately and stop you in your tracks. I never felt I needed to buy a gun with her in the house. Always felt safe. 
But as she got older, the hips and joints gave out. Hip dysplasia. The vet said the cartilage was gone. The only treatment was to alleviate some of the pain. She would also stand still and stare at nothing for minutes at a time. The kids visited at Christmas and got to see her one last time. The day My son left she stopped eating. It may be scientific, spiritual, or just wishful thinking, but I think they know. She was saying that it was time. The vet and techs were very kind and understanding. Told me we shouldn’t do any more tests. Took us right to the room and took all of her pain away. End of watch. 
I’m crushed, as I knew I would be. But most of my tears are for her. There’s no doubt in my mind that it was time, I’m just hoping she understood. Hoping she knew she was loved and not taken for granted. That’s what weighs heavy on me. That’s what hurts. 

Now the house is a little bit colder, a little bit quieter, and a little less joyful. But in time that will pass, and Bella and Max will gladly take up the slack in needing attention.”

I’m sorry I wasn’t there to see you go.

How can we have such similar experiences and such completely different opinions?  
College is head wrecking, it's a waste..

  
I want to go out and get an apprenticeship or something (no trade school here, you just get hired by a trained professional and then part time schooling)..  


I worked with my uncle who's a carpenter for the past week.. just fitting kitchens and wardrobes on a site plus flooring at a customers house.

It's not that engaging but it's nice work bar some heavy lifting (carrying 2 7ftx2ftx2"" doors up stairs for over an hour gets tiring.

During the summer, he couldn't get over that I wore a dress showing admittedly a lot of cleavage with our friends the night earlier.

The next day he gets out of the shower around noon and is walking around in a towel. Complaining and complaining.

I told him that it wouldn't hurt him to let loose once in a while.

He said, ""How do you just strut around like that? Maybe I should just prance around NAKED in front of the neighbors!""

I said ""Be my guest!"" And playfully reached out and swiftly yanked his towel off as he faced me.

There he was, dad bod exposed, naked with his cute penis and balls flopping from the unexpected contact. Of course he knows I've seen it a million times, but he was so surprised at how quickly I relieved him of his only garment, standing there eyes wide and mouth open lol.

In this moment of shock it was all I needed to slide the door open and give him a shove outdoors.

Slide.

Lock.

After squirming and blushing under my gaze, round belly (and all else) bare for the world to see, for 10 full minutes in the cool breeze futilely trying to un-slide the door (penis flopping all over haha) after we heard someone (no idea who lol) yell ""Oh baby nice ASS!!!""

After every conversation I think about how weird whoever I was talking to probably thought I was. Because of this I’ve pushed the few friends I had away because I felt like they all hated me.

10,"The beginner's guide to growing weed in India

Note: This guide is meant for novice or completely inexperienced growers. This guide is also supposed to be specific to the Indian region w.r.t. procuring the required materials and some specific environmental challenges we face here. The pros will not find much new here. Rest of you, read on.

So you'd like to grow your own weed and you live in India. 

The first thing to remember is to remain safe. Which means remaining SECRET. Which means not telling all your friends. Or any friends.
Don't tell anyone you even plan to grow!
For every single person that knows, you are that much more exposed. Just keep it to yourself. If not properly followed, this will be your biggest risk in growing, so be very careful and do not broadcast your growing intentions. Growing is far more serious for getting caught with than just smoking, and do not forget that. In India especially, you would probably be branded a drug lord instantly. Don't take stupid risks, and learn to keep it to yourself.


What will it cost? 
That is the main question, correct? Answering that requires some background.
You have two options: indoor or outdoor.
Outdoor is significantly cheaper than indoor growing, but also a lot less in your control. Indoors is relatively a lot more expensive, but you have ultimate control over almost every factor in the grow, and is the safest way to remain secret as well. 
For outdoor growing you will need a safe spot that gets at the very least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight a day MINIMUM, and is hidden from plain sight. This is going to be rare for most people, but if you have such a spot then outdoor growing may be for you.
The rest of us with no outdoor spaces need to be ready for indoor growing.
The cost of indoor growing varies greatly but the bare minimum you will need is some lights, a fan, a pot, some grow medium (like soil), water, and a decent seed. We will discuss each in detail further below.
Short answer: anywhere between 5k-50k is possible for your first INDOOR grow. On the lower end you'll have to DIY almost everything, and make do without carbon filters and such. On the higher end you can get top-of-the-line brands for every component. It's all down to your budget.

Seeds:
If you take away only one thing from this guide, let it be this: do not grow bag seeds! That means don't grow seeds found in the local weed you bought from your peddler. Those seeds will grow no doubt, but they will take forever and give you very little in return, if anything! Buy decent seeds, they are VERY easy to find and ship to India.
Just do a Google search for the strains you want. Attitude seed bank and seedsupreme seedbank deliver to India at very low costs and are reliable, tested personally. There are few sources within India as well that sell seeds, I'd be very careful about reading reviews before buying anything.

Autoflower vs Photoperiod:
When buying seeds you will have a few choices. Always buy Feminized seeds. This means the seeds will almost always produce females, which is good. The other decision to make is regarding photoperiod vs autoflower. Cannabis will flower only when given at least 12 hours of solid darkness, unless you buy autoflowers, which flower regardless of light. There are pros and cons to both, but I'd buy a mix for your first purchase so you can try them out and see what suits your grow style. I personally grow photoperiod strains since I can control their growth a bit Better with light schedules than autoflowers. Both options are fine but if you can't seal off a space for the plant where it can have complete darkness for 12 hours a day, and you don't plan on buying or building a tent, it's best to go for autoflowers to avoid any headaches.


Grow medium and nutrients:
This is an important choice to make since it will have a huge impact on your grow. You can grow cannabis like a regular plant in soil, and it will grow. It is after all, a plant.
But since it is such a high value plant/crop, it is important we give it the perfect environment to grow as big and healthy as possible in as little time as possible. A healthy plant requires a very healthy root system. 
Hydroponic growing is when plants are gown in inert growing mediums where the roots receive all nutrients from water rather than soil/medium. Hydroponics has shown to give higher yields and faster growth across many plants. 

Growing hydroponic weed is not as complicated as it sounds. You need hydroponic nutrients and some inert medium to work with. Try coco peat, available widely in India. It is the shredded husk of brown coconuts. It doesn't contain any nutrients but is a great medium for hydroponics since it hold moisture really well and doesn't interfere with the nutrient uptake. 

Simply plant the seed in coco like it is soil, and keep feeding it nutrient-mixed water. The plant will grow much faster and larger than in soil, but keep in mind that you need to cater for all the plant's nutrition needs via the water you are feeding it, it won't get anything from soil because there is no soil. Nutrients can be very cheap or extremely expensive, try some budget 3-part hydroponic nutrients on Amazon to start. Follow dosage instructions carefully and don't overfeed. Frutee 3-Part nutrients is a good cheap brand made in India available on amazon. For those with budget, get advanced nutrients brand or general hydroponics.

Drainage:
Your grow medium should have very good drainage. Add 30% pot volume of perlite or vermiculite, both available locally and on Amazon. Cannabis roots love freely draining medium....make sure the roots are never water logged! Adding coarse materials to your soil or coco will let water flow through easily, and roots get tons of oxygen.

Lights:
A huge component of indoor growing is the light. Cannabis needs lots of light to flower. Aim for giving AT LEAST 80-100W of LED lighting per plant you are growing. This is the actual power consumption of the lights and not the claimed wattages on the package.
You can either buy grow lights with 80-100W of actual power online for around rs. 8-10k, or you can create a fixture of your own using home LED bulbs. Buy the 3500k and 6500k color temperature bulbs and Combine them to make a fixture with PVC piping or something similar. Search for builds on Google. The goal is to produce an even canopy of light. This is your cheapest option, but be safe with wiring! Don't create fire hazards with open joints.
On the higher end there are LED panels sold by Horticulture Lighting Group from USA which are the industry standard for micro grows and perform ridiculously well, but will cost upwards of rs 15-20k after customs and shipping to India.
One of the biggest mistakes made by beginners is to not provide enough light, so be careful. Also check out LED floodlights sold locally in India that can put out quite a bit of light, but it's tough to say any of these jugaad lighting solutions will work for you long term.

Pot type and size:
There are a lot of options for pots, but for beginners the easiest is a regular flower pot available everywhere. A 10-12"" top diameter is enough. Make sure there are plenty of holes for drainage. In later grows you can try fabric pots and air pots which are root pruning containers and help create a more structured and healthy rootball below the plant.

Watering schedule:
Water your plant everyday when growing in coco.  In soil, it will be once in 3 days or so, not more than that. Check the top soil upto second knuckle and check if there is moisture before watering. You can also lift the pots to see if it feels heavier or lighter than usual....that indicates water levels.
Also remember: always water till you see a little run-off from the bottom of the pot. Otherwise there could be dry spots in the pot. Be very careful about this.

Optional- grow tent/space bucket:
Having a sealed off environment to grow has a lot of advantages. It keeps your lights contained and extracts maximum efficiency from them with reflective surfaces inside. Also helps provide absolute darkness needed to grow Photoperiod strains. You can also attach all your grow equipment to the structure of the tent and it is much easier to hang lights this way.
Building a small tent is not overly complicated, search online for guides that suit your style. This portion is optional but highly recommended, a tent will improve your grow immensely.
Optionally, buy a water drum from a hardware shop and paint the inside white. Make holes in the sides for intake and exhaust, and put a small fan inside for air circulation. This can be used as a single plant grow environment.
Folks also build cabinets and other structures...the point is to keep everything contained and secure, use whatever you like.
A professional grow tent dedicated for the purpose has it's own advantages, including the proper ports for ducting and wiring, and double layered cloth with light-proof collars on all ports. Not to mention professional tents are very sturdy and easy to reassemble after moving- they are somewhat expensive in India. About Rs 10k for a 2'x4' tent when bought from China from the cheapest supplier (due to stupid customs and high delivery costs also).

Heat, humidity:
Being in India, the conditions are not going to be ideal for growing most times of the year.
Not to worry, it's still feasible to grow year round in India.
It's going to get hot! Cannabis likes 20-30°C temps, and it easily gets 30+°C in most parts of India for most of the year, even winter time during daytime!

There are solutions:
I'm not going to suggest getting an AC, because that's obvious. If you can, then do it.
The rest of us can run the lights at night rather than day time, this gives lower temps on average since your grow light is essentially one big heater and best to not be on during the hottest time of the day. 

Air circulation:
This is very important for cannabis. You need to have a small fan moving stagnant air away from the plant at all times- 24/7. Not having this will lead to fungus issues, powdery mildew, and the worst of all- spider mites. Get a fan! 24/7!

Smell:
Will it smell? Ofcourse yes. It will definitely smell all over your house of weed. Your only option to keep this down is to get a carbon filter. Expect to pay rs. 20k for one kit, available on Amazon. 

Noise:
There will be noises from your fans running 24/7. You have an exhaust fan and fans inside the tent for circulation. Then possibly an intake fan for fresh air. All this air movement and the fan motors will create considerable sound if your fans are cheap shit quality. Don't grow if you are sharing your accommodation with others. 

Don't invite a maid into your house if you plan to grow. That is the easiest and stupidest way to get caught. 

There is too much to mention in a single post.
I think I've mentioned the basic components you need for your first grow. The most important thing is to actually give it a try. You may stumble initially but it's a worthy enough cause to keep going. The end result is free weed.

Above all, remain safe.

14,"I’m relatively young, married (which likely will end.. which is relevant to this post since I fear this situation would get worse). 

These friends are not super closer to me nowadays, but we spent high school together and I always gave them moral support and advice help.

I first noticed the “sudden” interest when I started working out and posting on social media, I had a lot of acquaintances talk to me, not everyone acted this way.. most of it came from people who simply enjoy fitness and kept things light. 

But my friends...

One of them kept talking about my photos.. kinda asking why don’t I post more body shots (I like to take artsy photos, I post rarely as well and have like 10 pictures), one day he got a bit weird and bluntly said “no one wants to see wall pictures”.. that got me by surprise.. I had told him (like I did to my other friends) I wanted to try swimsuit modeling at the time, I thought it was just good criticism at first.. but it was unlikely of him to be like that, I felt that he used that as an excuse to get me to show my body..? Am I imagining?

I always had a very pure friendship with him, we talked about music, movies, drawing.. he also apparently showed some of my body pictures/stories to his cousin(?), who started following me out of nowhere and look/like all those pics (only those) despite never talking to me or knowing me. It made me a little irked, I ended up deleting all of those.  Ever since that day I kind of distanced myself.

Then there’s this other friend.. I always felt like a sister to him, he had a hard childhood and I always felt that it helped to be there.. he lacks some common sense and can be very blunt (he suffers a lot from this, so I know about it), he comments out of nowhere if I put on breast implants from a picture I posted on Christmas.  I felt awkward and just tried to self deprecate, diverge “ah nah it’s fake bra stuff”. God I know he is blunt but what the fuck. Seriously? 

He had a call one afternoon many months ago, he said that where he’s at now he doesn’t like the girls.. talking about failed dates and stories (thought it was nice for him to have a way to vent) he kept saying that he misses the girls from where he is from and kept going on and on and on.. 

Made some cringe freaking comment about being good in bed (he used to try and brag to everyone in high school, not news), I thought he left that in his teens.. I guess not.

Now it’s what broke my heart to be honest.. recently I talked to him again, he wanted to maybe meet in person after all these years because there will be an unrelated opportunity, I got uncomfortable and said that I had a lot of things to work on and mentioned something about other people from high school, he stopped and *couldn’t remember who they were*, I mean people who knew him LONGER than I did. He did not know who they were, none of them. It made me sick.

I felt like a fool, am I longing for this “high school nostalgia” alone? Is he only talking to me for some weird sexual purpose? He can’t even remember who these people were, maybe our friendship is one sided. 

I fear that this situation will get worse if I become single again.  I am going through so much.. the thought of having to reject someone I thought I could always count on (or more than one) sucks a lot.. maybe it’s because everything else sucks now.
 
I battled depression last year. I am not in the best place mentally lately, lots of personal problems and things to deal with.. this feels like feeding the fire of misery. I also don’t want to believe that every single straight male friend I have will have a romantic interest in me.. it sounds so ridiculous and vain to think that..

I am so sorry for the length of this post, just to be clear.. I do not talk to them regularly, all of these conversations are months apart, I kind of cut back the contact because I felt creeped out. I have only two best friends I talk (and trust), they both said there’s something off and weird. ",13Jan2019,1
15,"I am 17 right now and I am in an apprenticeship in my ""dream"" job in a very good company. I have a few friends but I don't see them this often, only on some weekends to make party or smth like that. After work I mostly learn for school or play PC games, like the last 7 years..... I often play with my reallife friends but mostly with guys I met in the internet or friends who life far away.

What I'm trying to say is that I don't have really close friendships. On my last school (secondary school) I didn't make friends, we were just talking a bit but I didn't really like them. So now I stand here, not a single really close friend, just guys I play games with for more than 7 years (I really like them and its really fun to play with them, we can talk about anything, like private stuff...) but when some big problems come up I don't have a friend were I can drive to. I have to handle it alone or talk with my online friends. That's kinda depressing....

I don't want to end up alone and my only contact to talk about private stuff is to others is the internet. What makes it even worse, when some sh\*t happends in reallife atm my loved grandpa is getting dementia and because I don't talk about it I distract myself with working and playing games...

I got these thoughts because I just talked 3 hours with my online friend about future plans in our lifes and I said that I could imagine to leave my country after my apprenticeship, because nearly nothing holds me here and I want to see the world, meet new people. Before I die, I want to say: I made the best out of my life...  Than he replied that he could never leave his country because of his close friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't understand me wrong, apart from that I am really happy right now, but if I plan in the future I'm like ""nothing apart from my family holds me here"" I think thats sad :/

I’ve never been on a date before in my whole life. I don’t think any girl has ever expressed romantic interest in me, either. I’m 19 now, and lately it’s occurred to me that despite my best efforts (good hygiene, going out to socialize, etc), I have seen zero results, and in consequence my chances of meeting someone who’ll go on a date with me must be quite slim.

So I have this app called Whisper and I use it rarely. I don’t have many friends to vent to so I opened it up and made a whisper about how I’ve kinda given up hope on finding friends or going on a date and I’m feeling better about it than I used to. Like it bothers me a lot less now. It’s still painful, but it’s not *as* painful. 

A couple minutes later I got a message from someone claiming to be a girl who said they’d go out with me. They had a pretty high chat rating so it wasn’t a new account. I know now it was probably a catfishing thing but in the moment I felt so scared. And so I ignored the DM. 

The truth is that I get really intense anxiety when people talk about sex or dating or relationships in general around me. I honestly had not imagined that anyone would wanna hang out with me up to that point and all around I just feel bad about it. If it wasn’t a scam, it was probably a well-meaning person.

I'm okay. No deficits that the doctors or I are aware of. We don't know the cause. Which means it could happen again doesn't it?

I feel like if I was working this wouldn't have happened or if I didn't spend the night before the stroke reading this amazing book I found... if I was sleeping instead then maybe it wouldn't have happened.

I've been looking for a job in my field since August when my contract job ended. I'm interviewing but haven't landed anything yet. That's not really important though. I'm on medication now so I won't be able to drink for 6 months (no biggie since I don't drink much anyway).

My mom is really cautious right now and is adamant about me taking a low cholestrol diet and exercising more consistently (i have high cholestrol, not overweight, not a smoker). 

I am really scared of the tomorrow and days ahead. This stroke, it came out of no where. I felt oddly tired like EXTREMELY sleepy before it hit me and that was all of note that occurred before the event. ",13Jan2019,1
30,"My family is dead. I don't have anyone in my life beyond a few people on the fringe of my life that I vaguely keep up with. I go to work, come home, and once I'm home I put noise cancelling headphones in and sit in silence in the dark and wait to be tired enough to go to bed. I have no interests, nothing matters. I eat whenever I'm hungry and then feel massively guilty for spending money on food. 

I don't want to die, I just don't want to be alive anymore. The universe is so massive and the scale of time that the planet and the carbon in my body will exist is so incomprehensible that hoarding the resources it takes to continue existing seems wasteful. I don't know if there's all afterlife but even the void has to be better than meaningless consciousness. 

I'm seeing a doctor next week, and I'm terrified when I tell her how I feel she's going to dismiss my feelings as irrelevant. I'm barely breaking even every month, and I'm uninsured. Seeing a doctor and trying to get medication is my last resort but what if she just thinks I'm whining and sends me away? 

I want help. Someone help. I'm scared and no one cares.  Every time I try to tell someone how I feel they tell me I'm being dramatic and I should feel lucky I have what I have.",13Jan2019,1

33,"Hello everyone! This is my very first post on reddit and I'm super nervous about it. Haha! Anyway this problem started about nine months ago when I reconnected with someone very special to me.  He and I had known each other and were the great of friends but we fallen out of touch when high school started. Only reconnecting a couple of months before we both graduated from high school. We used this time to catch up and to make a long story short I fell in love with them and a couple of months had passed, he asked me out on a date. I, of course, said yes.  When my guardians found about this person, I told them he was a really sweet person and that there was nothing to worry about. They both proceeded to call a whore, slut and other degrading insults. Words cannot describe how heartbroken I was at that moment. I just wanted to run away from that situation and cry my eyes out, but I know that they're only looking out for me cause I have a history of being abused by family and friends. That told me that they're paranoid of me being hurt. I really want to continue this relationship with this person but I also don't want to worry my guardians. I don't know what to do.",13Jan2019,1

I crave a hug and having human contact with another being. I’m not even that sure why lol. Nothing particularly bad has even happened recently or anything like that. I mean, I’ve felt more numb than I’d like to recently though. Back onto the hug thing. I saw from one of the twitter subs on here that was like, “When you’re horny you can masturbate, but you can’t hug yourself when you need one.” Obviously, I’m paraphrasing, but I’m hoping whoever wants to read this gets the point. 

Since I’m laying in bed and typing this, I just wondered what the monster under my bed is doing. Is it listening to the typing clicks as I write this? Is it waiting for me to finally fucking sleep so it can... wait... what DOES it do when we sleep? Watch us? Wish it had company too? Do they think that there’s a monster above the bed? That could possibly be a writing prompt. “You are a monster that lives under a person’s bed. Write about what happens after they go to sleep.” Most likely, I phrased that incorrectly as to how writing prompts are supposed to go, but whatever. 

I feel better about myself now that I’m typing about random shit.

36,"My whole life, growing up I was obsessed with animals and their behaviour and how they thought and understood the world. Science fascinates me, and humanity has always wondered about aliens without spending much time considering the aliens we already share this earth with.

&amp;#x200B;

The question of how differently reality can be experienced between different life forms is the root of what fascinates me about ethology. I spent just as much time researching animals as I did doing other things I enjoyed, like video games. I worked hard in school and I somehow knew I would succeed just because my gut told me failure was not an option. No matter how hard it was, or how many times I failed, I just didn't have a choice but to get up, dust myself off, and keep chipping away at achieving my dream of pioneering research on the topic. I wanted to be the next Jane Goodall. I had to be. Sometimes I would exhaust myself with my burning desire, and I would yearn to just slow down and stop but it was like a hunger I couldn't ignore.

&amp;#x200B;

When my mom died when I was 19, my fire died with her.

&amp;#x200B;

I was so empty I didn't even recognize myself when I looked in the mirror after she was gone. Beforehand, when nothing else worked, I could dive into information about my passion and try to escape whatever I wanted to get away from. But when I returned to this solution, I didn't care anymore. I was surprised - nothing had ever made me uninterested in eating up anything I could about animals - and now I just didn't care at all. I accepted it made sense after my loss, and wondered how long it would take to come back. I was a little worried, but I dragged myself through the days despite how much I wanted to end them all together.

&amp;#x200B;

It never did come back - not like it used to be anyway. There's a tiny curiosity and that's it. I even tried to throw myself back into it and it just doesn't stick. So for the last five and a half years, I've struggled a lot but I'll keep it short and just say I've just been wandering along.

&amp;#x200B;

After a lot of struggling I finally got some help and was able to improve my life a little bit. I floated along for a while more, spent a lot of energy ruminating about myself and how to heal, and maybe I did heal a little. I finally started thinking about taking the next step in my life, getting a better job, financial security, education, thinking about my future etc. After spending at the very least six months thinking about what kind of degree would be a good choice for me at this point in my life, I finally settled on one. And now that I have a direction toward a career I can find some fulfillment from, I'm feeling that old fire come back.

&amp;#x200B;

I've barely been able to think about anything else, and even though the summer semester doesn't start until May, I've been restless to get everything done now. I have a plan and I'm so excited to get back in school, use my brain, learn how to make a better living for myself, and feel good about what I'm doing. For a long time, I though maybe the fiery part of me just died too. I missed the way I used to be. I would tell people I'd wish they could've known me before I was a shell of my old self. There were a lot of bad things about my old self that needed to die from the loss, but I hope I can see this part come back. I hope I can make myself and those I care about, proud.",13Jan2019,1

38,"(DISCLOSURE: this is my first post, and I don’t know if it’s in the right place or relevant. Feedback welcome 🤷🏼‍♀️)

Whenever ANY potentially negative situation pops up in my life, I do the “5’s”. It’s served me well, and I figured I would share, in hopes it’ll help someone else...... It works like this: 

Ask yourself:

5 minutes:
Will this matter in five minutes?! 
If the answer is no, tell yourself that! 
If I’m waiting in a line, or someone cut me off, or someone I don’t know personally was rude. F that! This doesn’t change my life in any way, and so I’m not going to waste my energy on it, at all. 

5 hours:
Will this matter in five hours?
Maybe you missed a flight or had a fight with a friend or you’re running late (which wants to stress me out every time). Maybe he/she/they didn’t text you right back? Really though, will that matter by the end of your day? If not, do some damage control and let it go. 

5 days:
Will this matter in five days?
Sometimes things happen that will be a major inconvenience! Things like, having to start a project over or getting sick, maybe missing some work, and suffering financially, because of that. The key word is “inconvenient”. Yes, it’s understandable to get upset, but keep your perspective and stay as positive as possible. 

5 months:
Will this matter in five months? 
Maybe it’s a move, or having to take a class over or you had a car accident 
These things are the time to take action! Call your friends, your family, anyone who can help and change the course, to fit and/or change things in your favor. This too shall pass, but try harder and ask for help. It’ll be there for you, or you’ll find it. 

5 years:
Will this matter in five years? 
These should be the things you allow to “consume” you. They’re the decisions that deserve the bulk of your power and energy. Things like school or children or marriage or a long term investment. Whatever it is, it’ll matter in the long run. 

I absolutely realize, that five minutes inevitably turns into five years, so sometimes the little things make a major impact. That said: I’ve found that often times just asking myself what “5” things belong helps me to keep things in perspective, and ultimately stay positive and productive.

40,"I hate my life. I built a life for myself that's getting harder and harder everyday to face. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to get this off my chest.

&amp;#x200B;

I grew up in a small town and had a hard time connecting to people and making friends. No big deal, we all go through that to some degree. I had close friends and very loving parents, but I could never shake the feeling of isolation. I found comfort in music. I've always adored music. I started playing guitar when I was 15(I'm 27 now) and I found writing and playing music helped my depression immensely. I knew I wanted to play music for a living, and that's all I knew. I didn't care about school, so my grades tanked. I didn't care about life, setting up my future, or learning how to function in the world. I just wanted to play music. It was what I thought the hardest time in my life. I dropped out of high school in my senior year and took the GED. A few years later I made a series of terrible decisions because I just. didnt. care. 

&amp;#x200B;

It all changed when my uncle extended an olive branch and let me drop my old life and old town to live in LA with him and his family. I couldn't describe how excited and hopeful I was to go somewhere new, I really felt like the world was in front of me for the first time. My parents were sad but happy to see me go. I flourished in my new city. I reinvented myself. I could be whoever I wanted. I made great new friends, joined a fun band, and even started dating! That was all so new to me. I was so excited to wake up and embrace a new day, a new adventure. Everything was so new and life felt so full of purpose and mystery. I met a girl from Peru through a foreign exchange program. We got close. She informed me she was moving to Seattle to go to school, and that I should tag along. I felt so invincible I thought ""why not?"" and threw everything away to move out to Seattle and be with her. I convinced my best friend of 15 years to move out with us so we can all share an apartment. The rent would be cheap, I got to live with my best buddy and my new girl, new city, what could go wrong?

&amp;#x200B;

First thing I noticed upon moving out was that she had no intention of going to school. In fact, I was going to need to marry her if I wanted to keep her around. So I did. We knew each other for about a month and a half. My best friend told me I was making a terrible, terrible mistake. I didn't listen. Immediately after our marriage, my best friend and her started butting heads. They hated each other. He kept pleading with me to see his side and drop her. I told him to kick rocks. I lost my best friend of 15 years within 2 months of moving out to my new city. That was about a year and a half ago, we still don't talk. We probably never will again. He was my brother, I miss him dearly. 

&amp;#x200B;

After we left that apartment, the only place that would take us was a 160sqft microstudio. Me and my wife have been living in this microstudio for 1.5+ years. It's expensive, it stinks, and all we do is fuck, fight, or ignore each other as best we can. Around this time I lost touch with my music. I stopped writing. I haven't written one single song since I've moved out here. My wife convinced me to sell my amplifiers. I only have bits and pieces of what once brought me so much joy. We hardly get along, but I don't want to sound like I'm bashing her. She's a great person. She's sweet, thoughtful, caring, and has a good heart. We just don't mix. It's nobodies fault, how could you know you want to spend a lifetime with someone after dating them for a few weeks? You can't. I realized that immediately after my marriage, but I'm stuck in some weird limbo of misery and comfort thats just depressing enough to fantasize about leaving, but comfortable enough to never pull the trigger. 

&amp;#x200B;

My grandma died while I was here. Thankfully I got to see her before she passed. While I was in town spending time with her, I was arrested for a crime I had unknowingly committed years ago in my youth. I'm now on probation and attempting to serve around 500 hours of community service in under a year or I go to jail. 

&amp;#x200B;

My days are bland, boring, and generally filled with misery and regret. I've developed ulcers from the nonstop anxiety and misery. My wife, bless her heart, is a very, very sad person. Most days are hard for her, and unfortunately she has a habit of taking a lot of her frustrations out on me. I get blamed for everything. I wake up, get berated either in person or through text about how fed up she is with our shithole prison cell apartment. Or how we don't do anything. Or how we struggle about money. I've told her many times that things will get better, we just need to focus and keep working hard. I don't even believe that *myself* anymore. We can't move because our credit isn't established. Nobody will take us. After dozens of rejected applications and application fee money lost, it's easier to just knuckle down and build credit. She despises me for it. It feels like the bad decisions I made growing up are hitting me *one after the other* like some kind of relentless shit tidal wave. I'm not upset about that, quite frankly I'm glad to finally be cleaning that mess up. I couldn't have done it without her help, and for that I'm very thankful. But I feel so dead inside. Every day I wake up in a city I dont want to be in anymore, with someone that just doesn't feel like the right fit. Sometimes we go somewhere to eat, other times we watch movies neither of us are interested in just to kill time before we can go back to sleep and get the day over with. I've never looked at a clock and thought ""Fuck, 3 more hours before I can go to sleep and forget about my life.""

&amp;#x200B;

My schedule these days:

&amp;#x200B;

Wake up, get yelled at, go to retail job to be yelled at

Get off work, rush to pick wife up, get yelled at in car about shitty apartment

Sit in car for *an hour or two* so we don't have to go in the apartment. We don't even talk. We just sit there and brood.

Go in apartment, get yelled at about applications, life, credit, money, and ambition.

Smoke pot, watch movie I don't even like

Get in fight, stare at reddit for a few hours while she watches youtube until its time to sleep

Lay in bed and stare at ceiling for a while until I finally doze off

&amp;#x200B;

Rinse and repeat every day. Sometimes we go to a park, or try a new restaurant. Sometimes we actually don't fight, and even manage to enjoy each others company for a few hours before things sour again. She's currently above me in our loft bed while I write this below. I have tears streaming down my face. Never in my life did I picture things going this way. I never really had a clear picture of what I wanted, but I know I **never** wanted this. This is going to be my life for the next 40-50 years until the sweet embrace of death comes for me. I'm stuck in a job I hate and can't leave, trying to save money I can't save for an apartment I don't qualify for while jamming as much volunteer work as I can possibly manage to try to stay out of jail. My wife just got done crying about how she hates the apartment, and how every day is the same and shes so bored. I don't know how to fix it. I genuinely don't have that impulse to go out and drink or try new things. Maybe I'm just too depressed. I've never really thought about death so much before, and when I was younger I was very much scared of it. Now it seems like a relief. I don't have the balls to leave my wife, I don't even know if that's the right answer. I'm going to keep waking up in a hell I've created and cannot stand. Nothing brings me joy anymore. Typing this through blurry eyes while listening to my wife cry and sob upstairs is just another Saturday for me. The sound of her crying has become second nature, I hear it almost every day. I don't know why I chose this life, or why I can't leave or change it. It brings me nothing but sorrow. Today the thought of doing this for the next 40-50 years is just too much. I was 25 when I moved out here. I'm 27 now and my life is so fucked beyond belief I don't even know how to process it. I've already tossed 2 years out, they flew by so fast I hardly remember anything that happened. Hopefully the next 50 are like that, and before I know it my service and vows will be done, and I will be free from the hell I've made. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you ready up to here, thank you. I just wanted to get this off my chest. I hate my life. I really, really, **really hate my life.**

It just feels like whenever I see anyone’s posts or I post something. I don’t care what another person posts or when I post I’m giving away a part of myself.

I wouldn’t run up to a stranger and tell them about where my partner and I went on our holiday, that we just got engaged or that we were having a baby etc. why should I tell all these people?

 I've been thinking about moving to Portland because that's where all the nerds are apparently. My aunt rents out houses in NYC and I spoke to her and she says she's happy to give me a place to stay at a fair price but I've been to NYC before and it's kinda awful! It's a big city though so I'm hoping I'll be able to find a community I can feel at home with. 

Also thinking about Canada but that's kind of a big commitment with all their requirements for immigration. But it's a nice place so I'm willing to try

63,"Hi Reddit, I recently got out of a year long relationship that started out wonderfully, but ended with so much mental and emotional trauma.

Since then I’ve really been thinking about joining the military to be away from my hometown and become a better me as well as many other reasons.

I’ve been having so many impulses to get more and more tattoos and completely dye and cut my hair off, and it’s feeling more and more like a borderline identity crisis.

I’m not sure what I’m trying to accomplish by posting this but since I have no one to tell in my real life, at least I’ll feel better getting it off of my chest online. ",13Jan2019,1
64,"To clarify, in my country both men and women must serve in the army. 

In the previous years, I was really against it. Of joining the Combat Forces and to be in the battle ground. I can assume that's beacuse of my parents, whom always said to me that joining the Combat Forces won't get me anything and anywhere. My parents want me to be in the elite forces of the Intelligence Corps, which is a very good thing, i had few interviews for some of those units, but sadly i didn't pass them.

Beacuse of the circumstances, i'm really started to think of joining the Combat Forces, and the problem is, as you guessed, my parents. If i'm only mentioning to them that maybe i'm thinking to join the CF, i'll get a hella yelling, and them saying to me that i'm ""lazy"" and that i'm not ""serious enough"" about it.

My brother is in the Intelligence Corps, and they see him as an example. an example that also I can be in those elite units. They don't understand that he's, as stupid and simple as it sounds, is smarter than me. He's very intelligent guy, really above the avarge fella. I'm not underestimating myself, but facts are facts. We are not the same. My parents think that because he's in the IC, i can be there too. They want me to go continuing learning (i'm learning it at school) Computer Coding, but i don't like it, it's not talking to me.

Of course my parents want the best for me. Of course they want me to be in those elite units of the IC because after your'e finishing your service in the IC your road in life will be made of gold. Of course they want me to not getting dirty, muddy and offensive. 

I don't know how to even get them to be ok with that. as i said before, i would get yelled at if im only mentioning it to them. 

I've already asked my brother for help, but he seems very passive about this problem.

Any help and comment would be welcomed, thank you.

66,"I’m currently in my late 20s and I’m doing okay in life yet my parents obviously aren’t happy with it. They keep pushing me to do things they want me to do for my own benefit but really it’s for theirs. Like grad school, they want me to go as soon as possible, which makes sense, but they get so invested in the process that they get mad at me for it taking a bit more time than was expected. 

So anyway, this weekend, I took my GRE and did okay, solidly average, and when I told my mom, she went into a rant about how I keep fucking up and then even brought my girlfriend into it, saying how everything she saw and heard about her makes her sound like a country hick. Meanwhile, she never met her, and then she told me she has no interest in meeting her. She asked me why I’m wasting my time with her and how this girl isn’t a good long term match for me, etc. Personally, I’m not even thinking like that because I just enjoy my time with the girl but to hear my mom just spew this vitriol like a nasty fucking woman makes my blood boil. 

So yeah, I’m basically over my parents for a while and I may just limit my contact with them to special occasions from now on because it’s getting to the point where they treat me like some child while also telling me I’m an adult who has to make adult decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

So a few years ago, I went back to school at the age of 27 to get a second degree. I graduate in 6 months, and I am so proud of myself. The Degree is in Interactive Narrative Design, which involved a lot of design, and marketing, along with programming. I loved my courses, but I guess... I was expecting more from my programming classes than I got. I don't feel like I have anything substantial to show an employer, like I would with my marketing or design skills.

I thought about making a Membership Management system with Python and Django, but a buddy of mine says that is way more involved than I think it will be.

Ever since college though we've been talking less and less. I can't really blame her; she has multiple jobs and goes to school so she's obviously busy. But it still hurts a lot that I've only seen her once in the past six months, and she rarely has the time to talk to me anymore.

80,"A little over 2 years ago, my boyfriend at the time sexually assaulted me. It took me a VERY long time to admit that, because I said yes.

I had been dating this guy for about one year at the time it happened, but it started even months before that. We started dating right after I turned 18 and he turned 20. This was fall 2015. He was my first serious boyfriend, my first love (at least I thought so at the time), and the man I lost my virginity to. I was naive and choosing to ignore any red flag that I noticed at the time. I had told him from very early on that I would be okay with trying different things in bed, but there was one thing that was off limits (anal). He said that was fine, and he didn’t really care to do it either. About 6 months into our relationship, though, he started making comments like he “really needs to do it” and that he bets he could convince me to try it at some point. Whenever he did that, I would feel very uncomfortable, and would kind of just awkwardly laugh and say something like “Noooo, I don’t think so.” After all, I had told him multiple times that it was something I really didn’t want. 

He was spending the night at my apartment after going bar hopping for his 21st. We started having sex, and then at some point he asked if he could have all of me. I said yes, and a few seconds later, he tries to start having anal sex with me. When I realized that’s what was happening, I told him no. I told him I didn’t want to do that. Then he said something along the lines of “I thought you wanted to give me everything and let me have all of you.” And I thought that was what I wanted too. So I said okay. 

Then in the next several days I felt very weird. I felt.. dirty and kind of violated. I tried to push past it because I thought it was just me regretting it. About 2 nights after it happened, I felt completely terrible and started having a panic attack. I even called a sexual assault hotline and explained what happened and the woman said “Well it sounds like he coerced you..” and I was so in denial that I cut her off and said no. I said “There’s no way he would do that,” even though he so obviously did. 

Up until about a year ago, I had kept it to myself (aside from one friend I had told when I got way too drunk once about 6 months before that). There were so many times during that first year where I would think about it and just feel so gross and uncomfortable and like there was something wrong with me for not being able to get over it. 

At some point in the first few months of 2018, I finally realized how wrong it was. I finally realized how much he had been manipulating me even before the night that it happened. I realized that’s why I started having trust issues with people. He knew exactly what he needed to do/say to get what he wanted, and that’s what he did. 

I’m happy to say that I have made a lot of progress in accepting what happened and moving past it in this last year. It was just so hard for me to understand that he did something wrong since I was the one that said it was okay. Part of the reason I decided to write this was so I could get this out and tell my story. Most of it, however, is in hopes that I can maybe help someone struggling with a similar situation. 

I feel like this happens more often than most people realize, and we should all know how wrong it is. And it’s so different from deciding to do something and then regretting it. Being manipulated into doing sexual acts you have made explicitly clear you don’t want to do is sexual assault.

84,"Tl;dr down there

I changed highschools. Basically after finishing 8th grade we were supposed to choose what we want to do for highschool and pick one. I was confused as hell, and went to one that doesnt really teach you much, probably below average. I spent 2 years there, indecisive still, but finally changed profiles, went from economy to math and programming, mostly because thats where all my friends were (at another, better school tho) because that’s what i thought i wanted. 

First semester is now almost over and im having problems with both math and programming and everything seems stressful as hell. I feel like i could make it work but i can’t make myself do anything for my own sake. Tomorrow for example i’ll have to turn in 2 pages of exercises but i have done none of them. Last week i told myself i’ll do them bit by bit, working everyday so i wont have them piled up for the last day. Fast forward to today, nothing done, NOTHING. It was always on the back of my mind, didn’t even enjoy my break because of that thought, but never got myself to do them, why? Maybe because i have a really hard time solving them, which suggests i should do  even more, for practice, so i can do them at the class level, so all the more reason to start working. No. I did not do a single thing. I hate myself for it. Im on the edge in programming too, told myself at the beginning of the break that i’ll do at least a problem every day. Didn’t even open CodeBlocks. This vacation was supposed to be the time i caught up and made some progress, but i procrastinated through all of it, just stressing myself out.Either way, maybe programming is not what i want to do in life. Maybe i dont have to be good at it, just finish the highschool and do what i enjoy.

But that brings the other question. What exactly do i enjoy? To which i apparently have no answer, guess i’ve really been surviving these last years instead of living my life.

98,"Tl;dr: After falling down the rabbit hole of depression and mental illness, I’m able to say that I’m finally coming back. 

About 3 years ago my mother moved in with my family (SO and 2 kids). Very borderline personality that I have been dealing with all my life. I was okay with her down the road but as soon as she moved in... not good. My SO... I wouldn’t call him selfish or narcissistic, but if he couldn’t use the word “I”, I think he would explode. Constantly talking about how he does things, how his way is the best way, etc. I tried for decades to do things the way he wanted them done, and I was never met his standards. 

So, he’s working all the time, my mother is here with me judging my decisions I make with my children, and I’m basically doing all of the child rearing and household chores myself after working all day long just like he does. He would come home and fall asleep in front of the TV. 

My depression and social anxiety cranked way up. I began engaging in self-destructive behaviors. I drove my kids away. Stopped communicating with my family pretty much completely. After a year of really flying off the rails I sought help. Come to find out I’m bipolar with ADHD. I was given medication, started seeing a therapist, and tried to be better. I’ve been working on it for over a year now. 

Today, my daughter asked if we could go to the store so we could get snacks. Usually it’s a fight because I hate leaving the house on the weekends. I hate going to the store. This time, I was just like, “Ya. Let’s go.” She looked at me shocked, “Wait. What? Really?” I said, “Ya let’s go. Do you want to go to that candy store at the mall?” So, we went to the mall, got some awesome candy, went to Hot Topical and got Supernatural rings. Mine says “Jerk” and hers says, “Bitch”. We went to Build a Bear and made a bear together. We ate at the food court, and as we’re sitting there she looked at me and said, “I have had a really great day with you, mom. Thanks.” No, I didn’t cry. I just said, “You know what? I have too. I love you.”

Most kids my age just wrestle for school. 

The ones who dont get extra practice at school and their club so I get left behind because its assumed I should know everything the school normally teaches you.

This all adds up to me getting destroyed all the time.
