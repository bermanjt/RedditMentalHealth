4,"My mom (f43) has been dating this guy (m51)for about 10 years. From the first day I met him, I never liked him. Growing up, we never got along. We’d always argue and I’d always get grounded for weeks when I was 9-15 for staying stupid shit to him. I distinctly remember when I was 10 and I called his son a bastard (I didn’t know what it meant at the time, I just heard it used in TV) and being grounded for so long I read most of our personal children’s book collection. Over the last three years, my mother has broken up with him due to him being extremely controlling and manipulative. From the first day they got together (my mom and her ex boyfriend) he caused a big strain in our relationship. I just recently started getting close again with my mom after years of hating her because of him. These last couple weeks they’ve been fighting more because she finally moved all his stuff out of her room and into another bedroom. His name is on the lease to our apartment so if we were to kick him out, he’d call the police and legally he’ll still be able to come in. My mom has been nice and tries to avoid problems with him. She gave him about 2 1/2 years to find a place to stay since he’s disabled (he’s epileptic). But I’m proud to say that she hasn’t been holding her tongue anymore and has been telling him off every time he tries to start shit with her. The other day her and her best friend (he’s gay and her ex boyfriend is really homophobic and made a big deal with her for having him over all the time) were binging a season of American horror story they haven’t watched and they were watching it pretty late and her ex boyfriend told her to put it down because he was trying to sleep which she did. He later came downstairs around 3-4am when they were still watching it and was threatening her friend with a large stick and then he called the police and DCF. We didn’t know he called DCF until today when we came home from grocery store to find a letter they left that says we missed their visit and should reschedule. What are the odds of DCF coming a day or two after her ex calls the police? She asked him today about it and he was denying everything. My mom, me (f18), and my younger brother (m16) do smoke weed in the house and I don’t know if he has proof of any of us smoking and might use that against us. I know DCF won’t do anything with me since I’m an adult but I don’t want anything happening to my brother for no reason. My moms ex is trying to starts fights with her over little things.  I just needed to vent and if anyone knows anything about anything and is willing to give me advice it’d be much appreciated 😊",02Oct2019,2
5,"I'm sad. 

I'm 23 and yesterday was our course's first night out. So all 3 years, from freshmen to seniors, were in the same bar having a drink. Some other people from other courses were there, like this girl. She's kinda cutish. She's not the type of girl that turns everyone's heads but she has that quirky style that I personally find attractive af. I never talked to her in any meaningful way apart from making a few jokes or messing with her from time to time since we get along with the same people and sometimes stumble into each other. She's best friends with a cool girl from my class which is one of the coolest chicks in college too. 

Anyway. Me and some friends had just had kebab chicken with garlic sauce so our breath smelled delicious I would imagine. I sat next to her and she made some comment about it. I jokingly opened my mouth as much as I could without eating her and said something like ""I'm sorry, I can't hear you over the music"". She laughed, made some random comment I don't exactly remember and then fucking stared into my eyes. And I mean. STARED. For 15+ seconds. Dude it got awkward. I mean I felt like coming down to earth and be real with her and maybe complement her or whatever. I'm not good with bars with a lot of people in them, okay? Give me a break. Eventually she broke a smile and looked away so I guess I won? I'm not too sure about that though. Talked with a few more people, then a friend of mine invited me to go downstairs and play a game of pool. So I paid her a beer and went downstairs.

Now, I'm not the type of person that's good at pool, okay? I'm the kind of person that sometimes manages to hit the right ball without making it fly off the table and cause someone a concussion. BUT I WAS WINNING. Swear to God I was. And all the balls that were not inside the holes were very near the holes. 

So the chick from earlier comes out of the bathroom, which is right next to the pool table. And I commented something like ""Aren't you a stalker"" or whatever. DUUUUUUDE. Girl just comes to the table, all smiles and stuff. AND SHE MESSES UP THE GAME. She just sweeps the table with her arm and puts all the balls together on the other side.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING WOMAN

Then she smiles and winks and goes ""Much better now"" and goes back upstairs. And I smile and roll my eyes. We had to reset the game. 

And I lost.

I'm not even going to be there when he is being tested due to college responsibilities but I don't know if I even want to. I saw a video demonstrating the procedure and it pretty much worries me. 

I do believe I still have a lot of asking to do so I can fully comprehend if this is a normal procedure that some are just a bit more unfortunate to go through or if I should worry that such a procedure is necessary.

16,"I’m in 10th grade, all throughout my life I have been a good student (came from second gen Asian immigrants). I have always had high standards, ever since this year has started I have 0 motivation for anything and I can’t focus on anything. I struggle with ADHD but it’s not horrible, I used to be able to focus. I’m taking 3 AP’s and a bunch of honors and I need to get good grades but I just don’t care. 

My parents yell at me everyday and force me into a room and make me study for hours upon hours with minimal breaks and I just can’t handle it anymore, I stay up late and wake up early, I don’t think I can do it anymore. I’m constantly falling asleep in class and I feel like my mental health is slowly deteriorating. 

I myself have high expectations for myself and high standards to get into college and I have aspirations of being very successful when I grow up. I know if I want to achieve these goals i need to work but I just don’t care. 

I have been taking my old ADHD meds but I haven’t been prescribed since last school year. 

I just want to be happy, I just want my parents to be proud of me. I just want to be me. But I feel like I can’t. 

How do I care? What can I do to make this better? I just want to be happy and successful and have good grades.

In my Language class, there were a few kids talking (loudly, I didn’t butt into the conversation, it was class wide), about sending something to the group chat made for members of the group chat. 

I got really excited hearing this, I’ve always wanted to be a part of one of these group chats, and I accidentally blurted out: 

“There’s a group chat?” 

They looked really annoyed once I asked, and they replied with:

“Oh... I totally thought you were in it.”

“Hah... well I’m not, do you need my username?” 

And then they ignored me. I tried mentioning it to them again, but they pretended not to hear me.

In addition to the issue I mentioned earlier, I’m not very confident. I’ve been trying to slowly work up my self-esteem, but after today it feels like months of work blew up in my face.

I don't really blame her, because it was a shitty situation, but...I'm just tired, you know?

I feel drained, and I'm sacrificing my health, the quality of my work and a few relationships with friends and family to help her navigate her problems.

And to top it off, I couldn't get it up for sex after all this. I'm so fucking pathetic it hurts. How can I call myself a man like this? Tons of people could have gotten it up and fucked her despite all of this, but I just can't (this has happened before too). 

She will probably break up with me and find someone better. I tried to be a good partner, and I know I was good for her, but there are plenty of good partners out there without erection problems.

40,"Hello reddit,


I am 20 years old and have realized some deep issues about myself that I absolutely hate. However I am to apathetic to do anything about. I have a complete lack of motivation, even for things that I want to happen. For instance I had a tooth that was bothering me and I was very self conscious about. The only way I actually did anything about it was one day a piece chipped off the back. The tooth was literally falling apart before I did anything about it. My smile is fixed now and I am much happier/confident.


Maybe that was a bad example however my point is that things have to come to a head, a bad situation has to happen or something has to give me a “wake up call” before I actually do anything about a problem or even just something that needs to be done. Sometimes I go for two weeks or so where I do everything I need to, start working towards my goals and feel really good about myself. But I predictably fall back into my old routine. Come home from work/school and sit in my bed browsing reddit or watching TV. 


I feel as if I’m often day dreaming, off in the land of nothingness. The thoughts in my head are often meaningless/pointless. For example I need to change my oil. Quite badly. I have the filter and the oil. I haven’t dont it for weeks, not that I wouldn’t mind changing the oil, it’s just that I don’t think of it. My thought never even crosses my mind.

I've had so many conversations that I've then stopped after asking if there's any amount of evidence that could change their minds, and they say no... Really? Who's that stupid that they can't or won't change their minds with new information... A lot of people.

I know this is a random sub for this to be in. But look after yourself, don't talk to people that aren't worth it. Don't try to change minds that aren't going to change.

I'm so done with like 90% of people. Judging me, not listening, telling me I'm a smart ass for giving an opposing opinion rather than just sticking to groups where everyone will agree with me. You don't get smarter by talking to people that will agree with you. You get smarter by reading more logical arguments, looking up more evidence and figuring out why or how stuff works.

I spend so much time not wanting to live because of how people treat me. It's so rare that someone will give me time or care about me. I listen to others, I'm calm when others are snappy because I'm sure it's just that they've had a bad day.

You know you are her one and only and you know she will stay 100% loyal. But never, not even for a day, take her for granted. Make sure you give her the love she deserves. Never ever give her a reason to doubt your love for her and always let her know just how much you appreciate her! Let her have her bad days,just like you and everyone else has, without reading anything into it. Not everything is about you and you sometimes ask too much!
You expect everyone to be there for you when ever your past hunts you. But you seem to forget that the people around you also have a past. Work on being more thoughtful and understanding. Don’t make unnecessary drama in your head just because people sometimes have enough with their own thoughts and feelings. You have your bad days too where you just can’t give your loved ones 100%. Let them have theirs too and focus on just being there for them rather than somehow make it about you and how you miss this and you miss that. You’re quite selfish sometimes and that’s not a good trait. Not at all! You can be a much better partner, a much better parent and just a much better person in general. Work on that every day! And hang on to this feeling you feel right now, the feeling of true happiness, whenever it gets hard. You have to stop thinking you’re not happy every time you have a bad day. In fact, if you kept your happiness in focus rather than looking for problems, you would probably not have bad days as often as you have. Stop chasing your happiness and start trusting your worth the happiness you feel right now! Enjoy life so that the people that’s important to you will enjoy having you in their life! Today is the first day in the rest of your life so start living my dear!",02Oct2019,2

I went to my table and it was 5 guys to 3 girls. Me, being a 16 year old teen who loves to socialize, I broke cause of nervousness and the cold. I made it through though. They taught me how to converse with girls better and what are in entrance exams.

I have seen a good number of videos.

Let me ask you this. Do you think Americans are different from other people? Do you believe Americans are more criminal, more violent?

I don't believe for one second that Americans are more violent. I do think that crime is higher here and that way more shootings happen compared to other civilized countries.

Specially concerning African Americans. I've seen way to many videos and read to many stories where an black person ends up being shot.

Why is this? I think there are many factors. Poor economic circumstances just being one of them. Personally I think the biggest problem is that in America everybody has easy access to a gun. The police here unfortunately has to take that into account. The police here is always on edge. Where I am from nobody has a gun and you don't have to fear for it.

The rules of engagement are therefor different. The police is only allowed to use deadly for when they fear for their lives or somebody else.

Here in the U.S I see way to may cops reaching for there guns and shooting somebody.

I don't think Americans are more violent. I think the rules of when you are allowed to use your gun needs to change and we have to do something about gun ownership.

67,"Embrace the Struggle

For as long as I could remember I have shied away from struggle. I came from a family who did so much for me.. Too much for me and this subconsciously created an entitled mentality. From an early age I began finding short cuts, the path with least resistance and quite frankly ran away from any struggles. 

I was the kid who copied others homework, copied on tests, did the bare minimum on all group projects and used others to my advantage. I was a selfish kid who was very ego driven. I always lived in fear. Mostly fear of judgement and fear of failure. Therefor I very rarely left my comfort zone, always focusing on my strengths and never my weaknesses in fear of not being ""good enough"". 

I have recently changed my mindset and I now see the growth that comes from the struggle. I see the growth that comes from failure. I see the growth that occurs when you put your ego aside and step outside of your comfort zone.

I want everyone who is struggling right now to know that it is happening for a reason. This is an opportunity to overcome this struggle and become a better version of yourself. The more struggles we overcome, the more failures we have, and the more we step outside of our comfort zones the stronger we become. No growth occurs living in fear and remaining comfortable. Go out, be fearless and live your best life because YOU deserve it.

I’ve even started learning new skills trying to boost my confidence, I am now a mechanic. I love who I am but still, I get really jealous and I’m afraid of what people think of me.

70,"My Girlfriend is recently going through some stressful stuff, and I understand that. I’m there to cheer her up when it gets to her and by the end of the day we’re usually laughing and cheerful. We are a Long Distance Relationship sadly and so I can’t see her in person, though I wish I could. 

I posted an Image on a Discord Server we were in, it was a picture of 2 anime characters. One a guy with the text “Me, thinking if she likes me or not still” and a female character with her foot up on the wall next to his head (They were clothed and all that) with the text “A girl dropping obvious hints”. This image was going to be meant for a friend of mine who’s dealing with a crush on a guy, who also has a crush on her, etc. My GF saw it and commented on it, “Umm. I don’t like this. Whatever”. A friend and I noticed this and I went to Apologize to her. We chit chatted over text a little and she just seemed to be under the usual like “Stress Upset” ya know? Just now though, we texted again and she was doing things that I know well means she’s upset with me. So I apologized again and specified that the Image was going to be meant for the Friend with the Crush shenanigans. 

She keeps saying it’s alright and that she’s not worrying about it. In our last conversation before she went to class, she said “Don’t worry about me, get better” (Im sick). She also said “k” and stuff to my “I love you”s. Im just confused tbh if it’s just the stress making her like this (Today is major stress day because of things at school today) or if she Genuinely is upset about the image. 

Regardless, I apologize and I will take all responsibility and whatever else comes because of it. I just need another head right now to help me think of this.



As I’m writing this she just texted asking who the girl was. I explained the situation again to her, about the friend and her crush. I apologized again for not specifying who it was for, and she said, “I could care less”.  She had to go to her next class and I said, “I love you, talk to you later” and she replied “mhm you too”.

A lot of people don't really seem to be into magic and sometimes I keep having fears that what if I am doing is meaningless.  I love acting too but am afraid of getting back into it.

She said yes but every time I see here there since then, she doesn’t ever go out of her way to initiate or even speak to me. Even when we are LITERALLY 2 FEET AWAY FROM EACH OTHER. It’s almost as if I don’t exist to her and this has happened on multiple occasions. 

I’m am not the type of guy to smother a woman. I let it be known that I’m interested and like to see what happens next because 
I feel like if they are equally as interested they will at least make the effort to meet you half way, maybe say hi or SOMETHING. 

Nope, not in this instance. She ALWAYS has her headphones in too, as if she is closed off and don’t want to be bothered. If that’s the case I would expect her to sort of avoid being near me when she sees I’m there, don’t you think? But she doesn’t avoid me at all. 

I can understand not wanting to be bothered cuz I’m sure women get hit on a lot. Especially at the gym but I’m just super confused because I find her near me just about EVERY time we are both at the gym. She is always coming to machines or equipment near me as if she wants to be by me. 

I used to catch her glancing at me, stealing looks, and vice verse which is what interested me in asking her to work out in the first place. I sort of felt this connection. Apparently I either felt something that wasn’t there, or it was there and this chick just wants me to chase the hell out of her which I’m not willing to do.

I was waiting for one of my college classes to start (which was in like an hour) so I asked one of my friends “Hey I don’t have class for an hour, do you want to hang out till then?” and he said “I would but, I want to watch anime.

Me and my friends all have this plan to get back together when we're off at college to see the Minecraft movie.

I want to live to see it, but after that, all bets are off. It's not like I'll insta-rope, but it's not like I won't, either 

It's... dumb. I'll only be a year into college. I have all these dreams and hopes and aspirations. But regardless of all of that, the only thing keeping me from exiting life through a high-up window is my desire to see a fucking live-action movie about digital legos.

I can't tell my therapist, both because this is absolutely fucking ridiculous and because it'll probably start some shitshow of parental involvement and hospital intervention. I made my plan to not die until the release clear to friends when it was first brought up, but I'm not sure they think I'm serious. Who the hell would? Its a fucking joke, or at least it was when I said it. My main reason for living right now is a literal fucking joke I made in the heat of the moment, and it wasn't even a funny one.

I will try to keep this short and, while I'm not necessarily looking for advice (although I won't say no to it), I'm looking for compassion and a word of encouragement because finding this out has shaken me to the core.

6 weeks ago we lost our dad (70) to cancer and our mom had passed in 2001. A lawyer who, unbeknownst to us, was his lawyer for over 20 years had scheduled a meeting with us for last Monday so we could go over his notarized will, which was very strange because we had already taken care of his will. His death was sudden because he was actually getting better so we figured that he might've left behind a rewritten will or something along those lines that he never had the chance to tell us about. 

At the meeting, we found out that our dad left us with documents, notes and diaries that contain over 300 years of our family history, dating back to 1713. It's important to note that our dad was a math professor who worked at several universities and was well respected among his peers. In a letter (written in 2017 shortly after he was diagnosed) that he left to us along with his complete research, he mentions the names of his colleagues who helped him find and acquire various documents and information about our ancestors.

My brothers and I always knew that we had a well recorded family history but our dad told us that it dated back to the early 1900s, and that nothing else could be traced back. To be honest, we were never too interested in any of it because he made it sound like it was boring, unimportant and incomplete. Now I'm going to quote a paragraph from the letter he left in his second will:

&gt;It took me over 20 years to unfold the history of the *last name* family and, while I have been made aware of the unsettling truths my search could uncover, I don't regret it. What I do regret is not coming forward with my findings and having to ask you to take care of this. I was prepared to whatever might surface and, regardless, I was burdened by guilt, shame and disbelief. Knowing the times you grew up in and the times you live in, the burden could be even greater to bear. 

To sum it up, he has explained his reasoning behind leaving this for us and he would like us to go public with everything but the choice has to be ours and all three of us have to be on board with it. There are 32 documents, 64 notes and 8 diaries along with other incomplete writings, personal items and photographs that contain over 300 years worth of information. All of it is extremely valuable in terms of history but it's also very tragic. There are documents, starting with a letter from 1788. that our ancestor wrote to (presumably) his son about 3 (possibly child) slaves he had traded and ending with the documents that our dad believed were written and intended for the 1850 census. It was a ''slave schedule'' of 14 people that only had their gender written down and approximate age for some of them who were the youngest. We have evidence that our ancestors owned 64 slaves between 1788. and possibly 1850.

Given that we don't have a solid timeline of slave ownership, we only have incomplete data from paper trails, the number is likely much higher than 64. In his findings, our dad noted that based on the wealth timeline (how it changed over the decades) and property ownership of our family, that number could be well over 100 in the 1713. to 1865. period. We can only speculate about the time before 1713. but our dad noted that it's very likely that our ancestor who wrote the 1788 letter could have been the first or second generation slave owner considering that our European ancestors came to the US in the early 1700's and it would have taken some time for them to generate wealth. 

Going into any more detail would be too specific so I won't do it, but now, my brothers and I are facing a huge dilemma. My oldest brother is against us going public because of the political and racial climate today, he has two kids in college and he doesn't want them to become targets of misunderstanding or to be labeled and characterized as something they're not over their family history. My younger brother wants us to go public with this because he also recognizes the historical value of these findings but more importantly, because it could possibly help the descendants of slaves trace their lineage and know their history. He also makes a valid point that there are databases with information about slaves and we could help some of them rest in dignity if these documents would help uncover their names or any information about them. 

I still don't know where I stand. I know that my decision is key because I can talk to my oldest brother and possibly change his mind about his decision, I just don't know if I want to do that. I feel like a hypocrite because I think of myself as a feminist, an activist, a fighter for human rights and equality and now that I actually have a chance at making things better, I'm hesitating. If we go public with this, if we donate everything we have, our names will forever be tied to this. We have a lot to lose here, people simply don't want to be tied to anything that's racially insensitive or a touchy subject, I have a fairly high profile job and who can guarantee me that I wouldn't lose my job over this? An implication is all it takes for a person to lose their job and have their career ruined today, let's not pretend like it's not the truth. 

I've done some research on people who have also come forward with information about their ancestors being slave owners and they all describe it as liberating due to the overwhelming guilt that they've felt. Some of them actively work with groups and non profits that advocate for reparations and they claim that ''people who discover they have slave-owning ancestors are morally obliged to campaign for national reparations.'' Advocating for reparations has been a part of my activism for a few years and now that I think about it, it was actually something my dad prompted me to look into. He knew what he was doing, I guess. 

This is very difficult to process, I keep thinking about finding the descendants of the slaves my family owned and having to face them. I can't help but feel like the culprit, as if I had owned them. I haven't been able to function properly since all of this happened, I'm running on coffee and tears. I'm still grieving my dad but now I'm angry at him too, I'm torn between my brothers, I'm doubting my own morals, I'm afraid of our society, friends and other family members and how everyone would react... I think I need more time to figure everything out and I have to let this sit with me for a while before making a decision. Right now I really wish I could hug my dad and ask for his advice.",02Oct2019,151
105,"This time of the year kills me. Reminds me of everything. I work retail and can get more hours which is nice but I feel like shit while I do it. My cat needs to see a vet. I have to dip into our savings. I refuse to not pay my credit card bill in full and on time even though we could and not be penalized. My fiancé is worried and his anxiety has gotten worse. His psychiatry appointment is going to be another bill, on top of the prescription he gets, which he feels guilty for. I wish he didn’t. I wish I could take his pain from him. We’re running out of weed and our dab hookup (more cost effective) hasn’t hit us back up. I have my green card but it’s too expensive to buy legally right now, so we’re both incredibly stressed about our mental health. I worry that if one of us catches a cold we’ll be down for the count because our bodies can’t take more stress and we’re so, so tired. How much money do I bring in for the company I work for? What percentage of it actually goes back into my pocket? My last student loan bill only has the collection fee to be paid but it’s still like $350. We’re going to be ok. I’ve gone through the numbers a million times and we’ll be cutting it close and going hungry for a bit around my birthday in November, but I’ll ask if we can have a birthday dinner with his family. I’ll try not to think about my own family. I’ll cry and I’ll sob at night and I’ll see their childhood family photos and feel ashamed for being envious, for feeling bitter. Christmas will come and go. Healthcare in America has made me almost apathetic. I’ve become desensitized to the shit our dumbass president and his followers say/do. The cognitive dissonance is intentional, designed to force us to roll over and take it. I’m worried about the world, and about my country. I always thought I’d kill myself. I never thought I’d make it this far but I am happy I did. I love my fiancé more than everything in the world and he loves me too. We’ll be ok. We’ll be ok. I don’t believe in any gods, but if you’re reading this, please pray for me this season. I’ll be praying for you.",02Oct2019,2

111,"All of them. Maybe they individually aren't racist/classist but they dedicated their lives to an institution that is. You'd say a police officer's job is to enforce laws, right? Well who makes those laws, and more importantly why?


Are people really naive enough to think every law is made only for the greater good of everyone?



No. So many laws are made to reinforce the power of the ruling classes/groups and police enforce those just as they enforce anything else.



Cannabis is literally only illegal because of racism and you could argue most other drugs are too. If a cop arrests, tickets etc somebody for a cannabis related crime they're only perpetuating a discriminatory institution. They're enforcing laws that were only made to keep nonwhites oppressed and powerless and to keep filling private prison execs' pockets.



That's it. No, giving that black 18 year old $500 in tickets for having an eighth of weed and some paraphernalia does NOT do anything to keep the community or anyone safe. Just forces them to pay money they most likely don't have to a system that hates them anyway. And it puts a mark on their record so next time they get caught they'll go to jail, or they might even on the first go, depending. Then we all know how much the prison/jail system loves to keep people in as long and as often as possible. 



And the requirements to be a cop in the US are a fucking joke. You just need a high school diploma and a sense of aggression. Go through some bullshit training where they're never taught to empathize or taught a second of de-escalation techniques, just point and shoot and keep your eyes peeled for blacks.



It's so fucking easy to become a cop and society treats them like Gods so much that it's no wonder fucked up people are drawn to the ""profession"" and those who aren't are converted quickly, and if absolutely nothing else they're serving the fucked up system like I said above. Just look how many cops are domestic abusers. *They're rewarded for violent behavior what else could we expect.*



Murder a black man in cold blood and there's about a 99% chance you'll get away with it. Even if he was unarmed, running away, pleading for mercy, in the car with his family, just walking down the street whatever the hell. As long as they're black you can go ahead and shoot, that's what this job is made for. 



Fuck cops, all of them. Every single one. Even you, your husband, friend, dad, brother whatever",02Oct2019,0

113,"Over the years we as a species have invented electricity television and phones, largely abolished slavery in many countries, invented vaccines, and improved the standards of life such that our population is now 9 billion and the life expectancy of a person is like 71 now as opposed to like 45.

We have come so far as a species. We've suffered some setbacks, made some mistakes, and learnt from them all to get where we are now. We no longer have to be worried about dying from polio, raped by barbarians, or getting our hands chopped off for stealing.

We truly have a long way to go and the next few years will be very exciting.
