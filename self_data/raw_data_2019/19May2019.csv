0,"I don’t know where to begin, starting from the beginning would make it a long drawn out story and I don’t know want to do that. I’m on mobile, and I don’t know how to add flares, plz forgive me. 

It all started with a small hernia that Dr’s refused to believe was causing me pain. Therefore, they refused to do anything about it. Fast forward two years of going back and forth to the dr, and finally getting to the point where I finally got belligerent with the Dr, hence the first time this Dr decided to physically examine the area.  What I found out later is he ended finding a grapefruit sized hole in my abdomen. Two weeks later I was in surgery, it was supposed to be a two hour surgery and I go home the same day. It turned into a 5 hour surgery with 3 day hospital stay.  The Dr told me it was so much dead tissue in my body, he had a hard time closing me back up.  Two months later I’m bending over to tie my DD shoes and I felt something pop. It was extremely painful, and I feel to the ground immediately.  I go to the ER, they do a cat scan, and proceed to tell me there’s nothing wrong. I knew they were lying, I felt it. I got belligerent again, I was tired of being treated like I’m nothing (plus the insurance through my job was shitty) I go off, rip the IV from my arm, and call them all liars.  I don’t remember who this lady was that came back to talk to me, but she told me the was a tear down the middle of my stomach, and I had 3 Hernia’s going down the midline of my abdomen. The initial hernia formed in the upper left area of my abdomen.  I have another 6hr surgery to fix those, only for them to come right back. I found out later, there wasn’t enough tissue for them to work with to close the holes, but the dr tried anyway. I ended up having a abdominal mesh put in, with over 100 of those titanium screw like tacks.  That was another 5-6 hr surgery, with 4 day hospital stay. The thing is after the mesh was put in, I never healed from it. This mesh covered my entire abdomen. My abdomen began to swell, I looked like I was at least 6 mths pregnant. I wish I could post a pic of it. It was horrible. The dr refused to listen to me, telling me one thing, while he wrote something different in my chart. He continued to string me along for two years then dropped me as a patient exactly at the two year mark, telling me there was nothing he could do for me. I find out later all the bs he wrote in my chart that was mostly lies, and bs.  I finally get insurance outside of my job, which allowed me to go out of network. The first Dr I seen told me exactly what was wrong. My body was rejecting the mesh. I had to have it removed immediately. This leads to another 6-7 hr surgery, mesh had adhered to my intestines, and my abdominal wall, it was all stuck together like one piece. This dr I do not blame he did his best to help me, and go cut the mesh away from my intestines without knicking my intestines shows true skill. The problem is that mesh did considerable damage, and I was still going to need another mesh put in. Because of the damage I had to wait at least a year before they could put in the new mesh. giving my body the time it needs to heal.  OMG!!  The pain!!! Pain that does not go away, it’s agonizing!! A year and a half later I have the second mesh put in. I tried not not go back at all but i ended up with another strangulated hernia and ended having to have surgery ASAP. I ended up having a total abdominal reconstruction with a mesh in placed. That was a 8 hour surgery. I was told it would take up to 16 mths to heal. It’s well past that time, and it’s still so sore I can’t even touch it, I found a new dr that finally told me what is causing all the pain. When the first mesh adhered to my intestines, and then was cut out, all the nerves that was cut, and damaged throughout the process are now permanently damaged, and the pain is constant because nerves are forever active. 

Now I just went over the events that got me to where I am now, but I left out so much. Lying drs, drs that don’t listen, losing my job, the emotional journey, I’m leaving out so much!! I’m a single mom. It has been an emotional roller coaster, and I’m at my wits end. I feel like I’m watching my life past me by, and I’m detached from it. I don’t know how to put it back together again. I don’t know how to be happy, and deal with this pain. I use to working, and being active. The thing is you use your abdominal muscles for everything, too much activity aggravate the nerves, my abdomen swell and even more pain. What do you do. I just don’t know.",19May2019,6
1,"Context: I'm an amateur ice skater. I started late (mid 20's, as in last year) but within a year have progressed to what's known as ""Adult bronze""--the point where you start learning and perfecting spins and jumps.

I entered my third competition today and placed third. \*However!\* This was my first time actually competing against others! (See, because my club is local I've usually been placed in a category of my own due to lack of, ya know, people and placing,) so tonight it was my first time against others;

I placed 3/3--however! I didn't fall in my routine, I took my time and compared to last time, I did better! So, although the perfectionist in me says ""You failed!""...the rational part of me says ""You had the courage to enter: you did well for your first time. There were mistakes, especially in your 3-jump/waltz jump...but overall, not bad kiddo!""

So I went home and watched the Eurovision with my family...and after like 3 drinks decided ""Fuck it--I'm doing better next time!!""

Even though next time is my first time with music! I might even 'fail' next time--but I competed! And I'll \*still\* compete!! And I hope to be eligible for the local adult nationals in a year! Because even though it's not 'Olympic' level...it's way more than I thought I'd ever be able to achieve!!! (And even if I'm not, I'll \*still\* keep going, because there's ladies in their 80's who just got to that point this year!! So there's always time!!)

...And even then...I \*refuse\* let my joints fail me. Just like I had a wonky entry in my jump tonight, but I was like ""No!! Don't you fall!! Drag that toe, woman!!"" And like, I stayed up!

(We \*all\* laughed. It was shaky as hell, but ya know!!)

(Edit! Just to be clear, when I say that next time is 'My first time with music,' What I mean is:

This time--It was my third time categorised in an 'Elements' competition, I didn't need music, I just needed to present a certain criteria, the movements. I was in Bronze category, but my fellow competitors were in silver, the one above me! The first place medalist deserved the win!!

Next time: is my first, actual 'artistic routine' with music!! Even if I stumble, I'm going to to act and present the part well!!",19May2019,4

4,"You are doing wonderful

You have many friends

His friends have come to you, both to become exclusively your friends and to just vent on what a manipulative asshole he is

He is dating someone who you know is opposite his type

It doesn’t matter that he dated her a month after you broke up

It doesn’t matter that he posted a video of them kissing even though he’d never dare post such PDA when you were with him 

He is desperate for validation because he knows his true friends have all left him

You are doing stellar without him

You will find someone who loves you with your flaws and your ups and your downs

You are young and you still have time

You will not die alone

Yea, you had great times with him. You may miss them but you have ample opportunities to have great times with others

You will succeed without him

Your success will be justice enough

One day he will realize his biggest mistake was leaving you

Regardless you will do amazing things in your life and you have so much time to meet amazing people who will fight for you, love you, and want to spend their lives with you. 

Don’t give up. Don’t let him make you cry one more time. Don’t waste your energy on him. 

You got this.",19May2019,2

7,"As soon as I entered uni, I got myself a brand new computer, with cash that I managed to save myself. It has been my baby for 3+ years now. I always knew I'd regret not having the portability of a notebook, but screw it. 

This thing has consumed me for these 3 whole years. Wait for the newest game to come out. Play it while waiting for another one. And so on, and so on.

I left my studies aside and spent hours on this thing. It had that sentimental value to me, as it was the first major thing i purchased (spent around 6k - Brazilian reais) 

After months of nurturing this idea, I finally got the balls to clean it up and take pics and put it up for sale.

I'm proud of myself for making these movements, and I can already sense the good outcomes this will bring.

9,"I still remember seeing you for the first time. We were staying in the same house for research. We didn't even introduce ourselves to each other. You were so busy with research that I would only see you in the morning for a couple minutes while you made your lunch. You were the nerdy girl, who looked so into your studies that I figured I would never see or talk to you again. But I did.

I remember our first of many hours-long conversation. We talked about our favorite childhood wrestlers (yours was Rikishi, mine was Jeff Hardy). I had never felt so at ease talking to someone. After that conversation, I found any excuse to talk to you. I would stay up to talk to you leaving the lab, and I would check your lab every couple of hours to see if you were there. I tried to find any opportunity to help your research. Despite me killing almost all of the plants I handled (sorry about that) you still let me help. We quickly became close friends. 

I remember our first goodbye. I don't know if I ever told you this, but I cried on the plane. I tried hiding my face from the person sitting next to me, but it was pretty obvious I was crying. I assume he thought I was afraid of planes as he patted me on the back and told me I was doing a good job. While I wasn't scared of flying, I very much appreciated the gesture. I figured that we would I never talk to you at the end of the summer, but we did.

I remember the first time I told you that I was in love with you. I told you that I had a big secret. My hands shook uncontrollably when I said I'm in love with you. You laughed and told me you already knew that. You then shared the poem that you had written about us. It was one of those poems where the first letter of  each line spelled out a sentence. Yours spelled out ""nashtynash I love you"". From that moment on, I knew I had found the one.

I remember the first time you decided we couldn't be together. You were a Christian and I was not. I tried converting to Christianity for you, but you knew it wasn't genuine. Deep inside, I knew too. We tried to be friends, but every time resulted in the same thing. We would get closer and closer to each other, and eventually it would get to the point where you would try to break off our relationship. It was an unhealthy cycle, but I let it continue because I was so scared to lose you.

I remember our last phone call. You were tired of this cycle and decided we needed to break communication completely. I knew this had to happen eventually, but yet I still hurt and begged for one more chance. You declined because you've always been the stronger (more hardheaded) of us two. Although I'm hurt, I'm glad we could have one last time to tell each other our feelings and have a proper goodbye. I thought I had used up all my tears over you, but this post is proving I still have a little more left to give.

I'm sorry that we couldn't stop from falling in love with each other. Although to tell the truth, I never stopped being in love with you. I'm sorry I can't be the Christian you need. Most of all, I'm sorry I didn't take you into my arms and never let go. I hope that, someday, we can see each other again and feel no regrets or shame to talk to each other.",19May2019,1
10,"I learned a lesson recently about the importance of self love after going through one of the deepest heartbreaks I've had in my life. What I understand now is that happiness comes from valuing yourself and caring for yourself because you know you're worth it. But I dont know how to start. I dont want to be alone anymore but finding myself in a situation where I am utterly, unequivocally, and literally alone (explanation available if sources need citing) for all of my social life doesnt make it easy to depend only on myself for self love and self care. I dont want to live in darkness anymore but it's the only environment I've known for years and I keep reverting back to bleak, depressive living like it's a routine. I dont have any friends. What does that say about me. I find that life is overwhelming. Not day to day life which is also overwhelming. But the fact that we are here and alive in these flesh suits with all these feelings and stories and emotions that add up to so little. I want a more exciting and involved and social life.

12,"Alright, I don't really know where to start but one thing for sure is that I really need listen what someone else would do if they were in my shoes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 21 year old dude from a small city in Turkey having some family problems. It's not like anything abusive, at least physically. I don't have a father, he died when I was 16 and I currently live with my mom. My sister got married right after my father died and cut all ties with me and mom. She doesn't want to have anything to do with us and that is the part that brings biggest difficulty into this situation. My mom and I don't get along at all because I didn't turned out to be the way that she wants me to be. Don't get me wrong please, the way I am is probably going to be normal, regular, typical for you but for her it isn't because of the religious reasons. She wants me to pray, fast, act muslim, etc. but I'm not even entitled in that category. After all, I'm an atheist since I was like 14 years old. 

&amp;#x200B;

The main problem with my mom is the way that she approaches me and her disability. She is not like super-sick or anything but it's all mental. My father's death really damaged her. Although it has been more than 4 years now, she feels a lot of pain and I guess it messes up her. She's on antidepressants and regularly go to a psychiatrist. Also, she has some neurological disorders, she isn't really able to learn new things like technology. Let alone using a smartphone, she can't even understand the AV button on remote controller for the TV, that bad I'm talking about.

&amp;#x200B;

Since our relationship with my mom has been negative all my life and have been the major reason behind my depression and me getting locked up in mental hospital for a suicide attempt back when I was 17, I feel like she is bad for me. It started coming at me more recently because I feel like I'm getting sick again (mentally) and she is the whole reason behind all of this. Whenever I come home from work, she comes at me with a lot of negativity even though I smile and greet her in a friendly way. She always finds a mistake in whatever I do like whenever I'm cooking she watches and says ''oh don't do it like that, do that, do this, etc etc. It's sickening, trust me. I have no love for her at all for all of these things and for the abusive childhood that I have.

&amp;#x200B;

I really do feel like moving out and even settling in another city but feeling hesitant because I have a good job here although I make a little above minimum wage. A part of me wants to stay because she is so petty and kinda old (58) but I'm hundred percent sure that she is destroying me. I honestly don't know where I'm headed but I have hope. I'll gladly take any piece of advice you give to me regarding everything.

14,"Due to the lifelong absence of my mother, I feel a deep and ceaseless dissatisfaction in every moment of my life.

Sometimes, I don’t recognize it. Sometimes, I subconsciously replace the cause of any number of abhorrent emotions with something else. Ultimately, when I analyze it, it all connects back to her.

I try not to think about it. I try to fill the hole with many things. At every chance, I drink myself into a thoughtless stupor or incapacitate my mind with cannabis. Often both. I do this because I can’t stand to be alone and sober with my thoughts and feel deep-seated anger and anxiety most, if not all the time. I also masturbate way more than everyone ever should. Although you might say, “This is normal for kids your age,” I’m starting to think it’s not simply due to pubescent lust. I’m starting to think that I fantasize about sex so much because I believe that if a woman performs sexual acts with me, it’s because she feels that I am deserving and she has a desire to please me, unlike my mother. In the end, my feeble attempts at staving off these feelings is fleeting and futile.

For years, I’ve buried these thoughts and feelings. I laugh and joke about it to delegitimize it. But it’s still there, like an immovable rock. Not the kind you hold onto because it helps you, but the kind that slowly crushes you bone by bone until you’re just a sad, broken husk of a person.

Try as I might to bury these feelings, they still bear their disgusting fruit. Throughout my childhood, I lashed out at anyone and everyone, at the slightest provocation. Now, however, I have taken up the shovel and begun the eternal task of burying these feelings.

Furthermore, I have always been very reluctant to share any of my feelings with my father. I just don’t trust him. Deep in my heart, I blame him for it. Partly because I don’t know the full story, so it’s easier to project my own narrative. This has also become a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy. Every little thing that he does to annoy me increases my hatred and distrust, which makes every little thing that he does to annoy me that much worse.

Often, even his acts of kindness have this affect. They have a way of poking at the beast that is my shame and self-hatred. The one person who has dedicated almost 18 years of his life to mine is the one person with whom I have almost no desire to be around because, as I said earlier, I blame him.

Not only does he occupy a dark cavern in my heart, but so does every woman. Although I have many good female friends, I have a deep hatred and distrust toward women that I have, until now, refused to acknowledge. This is likely why I am not good at pursuing women. There’s a certain trust required to make the leap of asking someone out for a date or some such thing. Some sad internal voice whispers, “Why would she love and accept you when your own mother wouldn’t?” This is a big problem because, as a heterosexual man who would like to have a family of his own one day, trusting and loving a woman will be the one thing I must do to ensure the survival of that future family.

My final point: If I am to continue on my current trajectory – going to university, getting a degree and having a successful career and a fulfilling life – one way or another, I have to give up burying these feelings, only to have them rise again and adamantly overshadow helpful and productive thoughts. I will have to face them.",19May2019,3

18,"Hey all,

First post here, apologies for anything out of place.

I'm 22, turning 23 this month, and I constantly feel alone because I don't have anyone my age to connect with deeply.

I'm *extremely* self-aware, to the point where grown adults ask me for life advice and to give them direction. I spend 90% of my time outside of work developing my mindset, improving who I am, or working towards my goals that I've clearly defined for myself. I don't spend a lot of time with people because I can't connect with most, and it just spends my energy that I could be using productively.

As I progress more and more into the depths of emotional understanding, I'm continuously connecting with less and less people my age (or people in general) because of my mental advancement. And in no way do I view myself as being better than anyone else, we are all on our own journey; but what's important to me (goal setting, being kind and empathetic /loving, understanding yourself, being ambitious and executing on goals) isn't important to anyone I come in contact with who is my age. Like it completely goes over most people's head.

If it is ""important"" to them, they don't follow it up with their actions and I lose interest in people who just tell me what I want to hear. I'm forced to have empty conversations with people that have no substance which spends my energy, but there's no other way to connect.

I feel alone and isolated most of the time because of this, I haven't had a relationship longer than 8 months because I can't find someone who has values, and I don't settle (I only made it 8 months because I made a mistake).

Does anyone else feel like this? Like you're in a situation you're not happy with, but doing something that's good for you just makes that situation worse? Can anyone point me in a direction? Because it's starting to turn into bitterness and I don't want that in me, but its hard when there's no one who can relate to you.

24,"I just finished my first year of college and I feel so lonely because I don't have any friends.

&amp;#x200B;

In high school, I wasn't like super popular, but I was fairly well-liked and I did have a decent sized chunk of people that I could talk to and invite to my birthday and stuff. I even had a best friend, that I could tell anything to.

&amp;#x200B;

Now it's all changed. I barely talk to anyone anymore, even with social media it's rare that I ever have a full conversation. My best friend and I grew apart. 

I can't make conversation with anyone at school, even if they seem interested in talking to me--the closest I got to an actual conversation was maybe a 15-second talk about a butterfly I had caught with a girl in my math class: ""Is that real? Creepy!"" ""Here, let me show you something cool. The spikes on its feet let it stick to my hand, even upside down. Butterflies taste through their feet, you know."" ""That is cool.. even though I'm kinda scared of bugs this one is okay."" ""I think they're awesome. I'd be an entomologist if I could."" ""Why not?"" ""Not a very in-demand field.""

Or random little ""did you draw that?""s or ""you did really well"" ""thanks""es. And that's it, for a whole year.

&amp;#x200B;

And I feel like such a weirdo outlier because when I joined college, it seemed like in the first two weeks every freshman on campus except me had an amazing friend group of like two dozen people that they went everywhere with and took tons of pictures and talked really loud and had nicknames for each other and everything. They'd roam in packs and eat lunch together and everything.

&amp;#x200B;

I know you're going to tell me, ""join a club"" but the thing is I've found that with every club I join you just get a bunch of ""hi-bye"" friends that you greet sometimes but never actually hang out with or actually talk to. Or, if the club is already well-established, then it's difficult bordering on impossible to try to edge your way into the group dynamic. I've tried clubs and they never work out. Not that any of the ones on my campus interest me anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't get it! I can't force myself to talk to anyone or make any friends. Just the thought of randomly walking up to someone and trying to talk to them makes me want to cry and throw up at the same time. I just know they'll think ""who's this weirdo?"" and avoid me after that. I feel like my time is running out before I'll be alone forever! 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm lonely! It wouldn't even matter to me if I had friends who I never go out with, I'd be happy just to have someone to text once in a while! I thought I could take on the world, but being what feels like the only person on campus with literally no friends is a different kind of hurt.",19May2019,2
25,"It started off with listening to indie music, and then psychedelic music. That led to modern  dance, visual art, and exploring outdoors. Which then led to smoking weed for the first time. That was the best night of my entire life. That led into trying shrooms and then tripping on LSD, which then led to smoking DMT. I'm feeling very uplifted and enlightened. Self analysis is one of the major things that hallucinogens helped me with. I have experienced empathy on a level that I never knew before. It's nice to feel that a part of you has truly awakened and bloomed for the better. Hallucinogens are sacred and to be respected.

27,"Tomorrow, I'll be the first generation in my family to graduate from college, a quite prestigious and expensive one nonetheless. When you see me tomorrow, awash in the large graduation gown, I'll blend in with all the other graduating seniors. My university is so expensive, it's a consistent joke on campus among its students. It's a joke I make too, despite knowing that I only pay about 15% of it because of grants, scholarships, and my family's lower income status. It's all my family can afford or as the colleges define it, all my family can ""contribute"". I do my best to hide it; it's not hard when most students wear the same collegiate attire and discuss the same class topics. The reality is that the playing field is not leveled even when we gain our acceptance and are given our grants, scholarships, and student loans. 

&amp;#x200B;

You'll turn down a few outings or hesitate initiating them knowing that those plans will cost money, money that you could spend on food. 

&amp;#x200B;

You'll try to spend any free time that isn't dedicated to classes, clubs, and school work working at your workstudy job because you know you can't justify asking your parents to send you money just to eat out with friends.

&amp;#x200B;

When your friends talk about the exotic destinations they have planned for the upcoming breaks, you'll try to sound indifferent that you are only going home even though that's where you always go because trips can be really costly. 

&amp;#x200B;

You'll consider turning down an internship because the pay or the hours are not enough for you to cover for your own housing and expenses. Non-paying internships are out of the question, even if they can give you that valuable experience.

&amp;#x200B;

The list could go on and these are not only all my experiences but rather a collection of my observations. These are not complaints because I've long realized that privilege is subjective and this is not a matter deserving of bitterness. While I may detest my workstudy desk job that pays me a little above minimum wage, someone who may actually be working a more physically demanding, minimum wage job may find me lucky. I sometimes wonder that since barely anyone from my high school has gone to my university and graduate from it, maybe they just wanted someone to represent a more ""rough"" neighborhood. With CollegeBoard's intention to broaden the use of their new ""adversity score"" by colleges, there has been complaints that it will hurt the more privileged students. I'mt not sure about that. While it definitely won't erase all the hardships, maybe, just maybe it's a step in the right direction to breaking barriers and creating opportunities for those like me.",19May2019,82

I know I'm a decent guy, have a good job, I have hobbies and interests and stuff. But in the back of my head, just kept thinking about it. Even the woman I dated previously was similar. I must be doing something right if they're attracted to me. I think the reason is that I wasn't particularly intrested in college and only went for two years. I try to avoid talking about graduating, how long I went, etc. Just wasn't mature enough at the time to take it seriously, and I'm working on going back.

I now prioritize myself and tend to my own needs and don't pay much attention to others around me, as long as I'm taken care of. Yes, self care is important, and yes I believe we need to stand up for ourselves, but I hate that what's best for me or how a situation impacts me is the first thing that comes to my mind now. I have been pretty selfish in some of my relationships with friends and family lately, and am just now seeing that. I want to be confident and independent, but I don't want to be this selfish and I don't want to always prioritize what's best for me in every situation.

A while ago We added each other on snap a decision I am coming to regret. First she demanded an apology for something I did like 3 months ago, which honestly wasn’t even that bad or out of the ordinary for my buddy and I. Keeping my buddy’s interests at heart I complied. Tonight I went to the bars and I got a stamp on my wrist that had an inappropriate symbol on it and I thought it was funny. So I posted it to snap and she saw it and I can’t help but feel she’s hella judging me and I REALLY want to unfriend her on snap but I feel like that would cause WWIII and lose my best friend in the process.

Frankly, my family don't even think I'm that bad a driver, it's just... I'm not fully certain. Maybe I don't like the control of it? They tell me it's supposed to be freeing, but it feels very secluded- causes me to feel small and fragile in a way.

📷

Hopefully this will not be as cringe of a post as I feel it to be.

First, thank you for taking the time to read this and consider answering it.

I am going to be 26 in 1 day and I am completely unsatisfied with my life. I want things to be different but something keeps holding me back.

First, I managed to leave the house only to come back 3 times.

I have failed school a bunch of times as well.

I had a car and wrecked it driving while sleepy.

I have Credit issues.

I have Avoided Legal issues.

I have Avoided Tax issues.

I have had multiple jobs and been fired from them.

I am not an independent adult.

Everything in my life is fucked right now.

I have the worst work ethic imaginable.

I am lazy, and unmotivated.

I am a professional procrastinator

I dont even think I possess consistent self discipline.

I put myself and find myself in great positions only to self-sabotage by avoidance and procrastination.

When I start things, I start with so much bravado. I out perform and everyone likes me. Then i loose steam and flunk miserably. Then everyone hates me. This is in everything (Jobs, Relationships, School especially)

I start things but never follow through with them.

I have such big goals and dreams for myself. But I get in my own way and fuck myself up. EVERY SINGLE TIME.

I feel like its either because I dont believe in myself enough or that I feel that I dont deserve it.

I am told that I am smart and have the potential to achieve great things but i dont live up to my potential. That I sell myself short 100% of the time.

My relationships with people are atrocious. I feel as though I cannot effectively communicate well.

Sometimes I feel like I dont understand people well because people say that I ask the same thing over again. Or im not satisfied with their answer.

I hear a lot that I am not capable of things.

I constantly hear: your telling me you want change, but i feel you dont want it bad enough.

I dont want to go through another year of being a mediocre human being when I feel that I am more than this.

I honestly feel like I this is a symptom of me not understanding myself and what motivates me.

I really want better for myself but i have this extreme feeling of apathy.

I dont want to continue this cycle.

I just dont know where to start or even begin to fix this massive clusterfuck.

I appreciate any help you can give me.

40,"I met a someone in dec 2017 and we became friends. We messaged/snap each other everyday (they had left in january to go abroad for eight months), even skyped once. Around april i realized that i liked them a lot. They were the first person i ever truly like. Beginning of july they went cold on me. No more daily messaging, nothing. Yet they still posted on social media. I felt really hurt. I was too nervous to ask what had happen because we werent that close yet. I asked after 2.5 weeks and turns out something had happened which made them unable to come back to our country. I tried to be supportive and send them little messages everyday even though they wouldnt respond. Eventually i gave up and stopped it all. I decided i wouldnt message them unless they messaged me first.

Then from mid august to december they would message me once in a while. I never had asked why they went cold turkey because i didnt feel i had the right to. In january i realized that i wanted to know. We skyped and they told me it was because they were going through a stressful time. After talking for over 2 hours i had thought we would go back to what we had before talking everyday but nothing changed. 

Around march i decided to tell them (that i had feelings) because i would have regretted not doing so. I told them not to tell me their answer and lied that i used to like them when in reality i still hold some feelings (less than before). They were shocked but after that we were able to talk for another two hours. 

I had thought that they wouldnt message me after that but at the end of april they send me messages and we conversed.

I have got a job but it is not that high paying and my parents are not happy with me, also they have pretty high expectations from me.
The problem with all of this is that I have started doubting myself and this self doubt has increased over the years of engineering. I am at such a position currently that I am afraid to face my parents because I have this constant feeling that they are disappointed in me. Both my parents want me to do well and get a good career but I am not able to get rid of the feeling that I have not done them proud and I might not achieve anything going forward. 
I have made up my mind to go for higher studies and have started preparing accordingly but everyday the fear of failing and disappointing my parents again just creeps back in and I feel like a lost cause. 
I haven't talked to my parents about this so far because I think that they will think that I am just making excuses for my incompetence. My Dad recently said that it is high time that I achieve something in life because I won't be getting anymore chances in life.

51,"i grew up catholic, my family was never super religious though. we went to church every week until i was about 8-10. my parents never pushed religion on me, they know i’m not christian they’re fine with it (my mom gets salty whenever i complain about my friends though even though she’s not religious at all but wants to think she is.) my friends are all hardcore christians i mean like, republican, anti gay, believe we’re suppose to live by the bible word for word, don’t cuss, agree with everything their parents do, you know the ones. i’m 17, i’ll be a senior in high school at my christian homeschool co op, i consider myself agnostic i guess, and i’m bi. 


you can’t have a conversation about anything without them bringing up god or gods plan or jesus’ love or whatever. it’s gotten annoying. i don’t mind christians nor judge them for their beliefs, i once considered myself christian. i really think they’d stop being friends with me if they knew i wasn’t religious. i tell them i’m christian but some of them know i don’t go to church or i’ve let it slip that i didn’t do anything on a sunday and they asked why i didn’t go to church. i tell them i’m ‘looking for a new church right now.’ they always ask me to go to their church with them and it puts me in such an awkward position because i can’t straight up say no but i also don’t wanna go to church. i’ve been to many different churches growing up and have no interest in going. i don’t putting myself in a setting where i feel so out of place more than i already have to if i can help it. 

for my school you have to sign a thing that says you go to church regularly, and you believe in god and jesus n all that. i obviously don’t and my mom knows i don’t but really there’s no homeschool groups that aren’t christian so i have to go. but the thing is i love my friends ! they’re funny and good people and fun to hangout with when they aren’t talking about jesus when it’s completely irrelevant (literally had a conversation about the fake moon landing and one of my friends arguments was that it was jesus’ plan for us to go on the moon and we shouldn’t question it . girl i-) but i feel so out of place with them when they do bring up religion. my best friend is the only person who knows i’m not christian and even with her i sugar coat it so i’m not saying ‘hey i’m not christian’ more like ‘i don’t know if i’m a christian for sure’ but she doesn’t even go to my school so every week when i’m there and my teachers are bringing up god in math class it makes me feel so weird. i can’t talk about this with anyone and it bothers me a lot. 

i feel constantly like the odd one out and this makes my life so much harder than it has to be. i have depression and anxiety, i already deal with major insecurity issues and this is just the cherry on top. i’m not insecure about my beliefs, i’m insecure about how odd i feel when i’m constantly in a setting that i cant be 100% my authentic self and have to put up a front to please them because they wouldn’t accept or support me. i guess it’s just upsetting knowing they wouldn’t be okay with my beliefs being different but i’m completely okay with theirs being different. i genuinely don’t know if they could look past it, maybe some but i know some wouldn’t talk to me unless they had to again. even the ones who would still be my friend would try and push their religion on me or try to convert me back. one of my friends already thinks i’m essentially going to hell because i don’t agree about the bible never being contradictory lmao. i’m already bi, which is hard too with them, but i feel so much more comfortable with them knowing that then my religious beliefs. which says a lot because although i’m not ashamed of my sexuality it’s hard not feeling judged and looked down upon when every person you know thinks it’s wrong,,, not all my friends know but if they asked me n the ones who have asked me if i was gay/bi i always tell them (i have a girlfriend but she long distance so it’s not super super obvious we’re dating.)

how do i get past this ? how do i get over the feeling of not being good enough ? how do i get over the anger of knowing i can’t be my real self because they wouldn’t accept it ? 

i know i could get new friends but my school is the only way i meet people, so meeting people who aren’t christian isn’t easy (don’t have one single friends who isn’t christian, one of my public school friends is super laid back and understands me n agrees with me a lot even though she’s christian)",19May2019,1
52,"Grew up midwest US in the 90s and everything was ""gay"". In my 30s now and way past that but there's still a range of activities I dont know what to label. 

I work in warehouses and environments that I dont have to watch my mouth for customers sake and my wife has adopted some of my vernacular for certain things amongst ourselves.

The word gay has come to mean any act that demonstrates your affection for another person. Not 100% sure how it developed but men dont have a great vocabulary for affectionate nonsexual acts.

So, the word gay, for me, has become a way to dismiss and modestly admit behaviors that show affection. The problem is I enjoy the crude, offensive terms referring to selfless acts because it's funny to me.

Examples 
""Gonna do some gay shit this weekend to surprise my wife before her birthday""

""Breakfast in bed? You're such a fag.""

Like it doesn't happen much but still. Also this one is pretty bad but quite often I'm like suspicious that people are letting me win games. Which I'm not too keen about, i think this insecuriry partly stems from one group I hang with who are all more mature and they criticise me when I do stupid shit (which is quite a regular occurrence), and just the way I'm the but of so many jokes there. I stopped hanging with them for a bit and I'm staying because it seems to have gotten better in that respect, and they do want me around, but even so, do they want me around to laugh at or with? the whole Charlie thing rom Flowers for Algernon.

The first major problem with the pro choice argument is that it completely fails to understand the opposition. To pro lifers, abortion = murder. Full stop. I understand you might think that there is no heart beat or brain functions for X weeks, therefore it is not truly alive, and I would agree with you, but you have to look at it from the opposition's point of view. To them, the moment that little swimmer is touching that egg, it might as well be as much of a person as you or I.  

So you can say ""If you don't want abortions, you hate women."" A pro lifer might say, ""No I don't hate women, I just don't want people to die."" 

You might also say, ""My body, my right."" They're thinking, ""You don't have a right to murder anyone.""

You might say, ""Because you need to respect my privacy!"", to which they would say, ""I think privacy goes out the window when you're murdering someone."" 

The solution I propose would be to start hitting hard with statistics. You can start by asking women with children who ended up in precarious, undesirable situations how likely they would have been to seek an abortion if given a chance.  

What percent of women who seek abortions even have the financial means to have and raise a baby? How much will it cost us if we don't?

How likely would women or their children (who likely would have been aborted) be likely to develop problems (crime, drug addiction, welfare, etc.) that require tax funding that directly impact YOU, the person who wanted them alive (when no one else did) in the first place? This is an actual statistic, and I believe it does cost tax payers quite a bit. Though I don't recall the actual figures and I'm too lazy to look it up right now.

What is the cost of an abortion on the tax payer vs birth and recovery for a mother and child?

You could ask families who have abused children how likely they would have been to seek an abortion if given the opportunity. I'm betting that number would be pretty high. Then you stop needless child abuse. 

Start discussing the crime decline people cite after Roe V. Wade. (For those of you who don't know, the large crime drop that happened in the 90's was often linked with Roe V. Wade. Scientists speculate that because Roe V. Wade was legalized in the 70's, a lot of unwanted babies weren't born. Those people would have been at the prime age for deviancy in the 90's. Because they didn't exist, there was a steep drop in crime.) 

Long story short, stop with just slamming the opposition with ""You're a monster and should feel bad."" Start treating them as a person with a different view that might be swayed if you provide logic and reason. 

I feel like thats how we need to start taking on a lot more of our problems with each other.",19May2019,16

60,"Hi, long post ahead.

Before I start, let me share a little bit about myself. I have never been in a relationship before. A major reason for this is because I was not actively looking to be in a relationship. Another reason for this is because I feel that I have relatively high standards (a personal opinion based on my eye candies).

Now, the story.

She was my classmate. Out of all the girls in my class, I instantly set my eyes on her. I knew I was infatuated with her. She definitely qualified as eye candy material, hence I was keen on making my move on her. I started hanging out with her more often and tried to observe her character. It also helped that my friend is also an old friend of hers, which allowed us to become closer. After a few months, I think I fell in love with her. Her looks. Her personality. She seemed perfect. She gave me strange, unfamiliar feelings that were different from those feelings of infatuation I originally felt. However, at that point in time, we weren't close.

Life hit me and I got seriously depressed after receiving 2 back-to-back beatings. She was a pillar of support during this period and I think that we started to grow much closer from then on. We began sharing our life problems and secrets to each other. I even thought of confessing to her.

Then, she became attached to a guy. The guy is an old friend that I'm on good terms with and they compete in the same sport. In fact, I already saw this coming, but I have no intention of causing any trouble to either of them. I'm happy just from seeing her being happy. I told myself to move on. Eventually, I found another girl (an eye candy) to take my mind off of her.

However, she was still my classmate. Her presence was around me for most of the school day. Gradually, after my interest in my eye candies have faded, I realized that deep down, some part of me still can't get over her. We had become close friends already then, and I can tell that she wants things to stay this way.

As we got closer and closer, she became more of a friend and less of a love interest. We casually say things like ""Love you"" and have intimate physical contact (hugs etc.). These would've made me dizzy before but I don't feel anything of that sort. Those strong feelings of love also seem to have faded. Yet, the part of me that loves her still lingers on. I've been introduced to other girls but I have never put in effort on my part as I just can't see myself with someone else other than her.

So, dear redditor, is it normal to have these conflicting feelings? Will the remaining feelings of love in me eventually go away if I find another girl like her? Or will time erode these feelings of love?",19May2019,1

65,"So I used to be a realist or a pessimist, but then I decided one day that I no longer want to be that person. That life is short and that I deserve to be happy and I should be positivie. And so I became a positivie person and my whole life changed. I remember how depression messed me up. How I couldn't study, couldn't work out, didn't care about a lot of things. Wasted time doing things I know shouldn't be doing. Watched my friends graudate while I am still left behind in my studies. I felt like a complete failure. I felt worthless because I wasn't making progress in anything in my life. I still couldn't bring myself to fix my situation. It was really hard. I remember that it was so much easier to get things done when my mental health was being better. I couldn't do anything if mentally I felt drained. But the days where my body wanted nothing more than to rest, I would push through. It was nothing. I realized then how much more power the mind had over the body. 
My life is not perfect now, but it feels so perfect because I am moving forward and I forgave myself for the time lost because it was something I didn't know how to deal with. Now, I am becoming stronger and stronger today and I am so happy. I feel inner peace. It was the day K decided I didn't need those people to accept me or love me or care about me or include me. I am finally living my life and I am more responsible and more happy and more content. I don't allow external circumstances to get to me. I lastly gave people the benefit of the doubt and if I know they're not good people, I just don't let it affect me in any way or form. I no longer dwell.

70,"I apologize for the wall of text. I've never written this whole story out before and I'm kind of spilling everything out. TW for possible eating disorders, food, body dysmorphia, etc.  I also posted this to r/offmychest

Going into college I didn't put much thought into the freshman 15. I was skinny, athletic, and I had a high metabolism that allowed me to eat whatever I wanted without consequence for all of my life. For the first semester or two of college not much changed. I lost a bit of muscle mass because I wasn't involved in any sports and I didn't work out because I had only been used to working out when a coach told me to so I didn't have much internal motivation for exercise. I gained maybe 5 pounds but I barely noticed.

I've always been a very snacky type person. If you have ever listened to the comedian Bert Kreischer, he says that he has a problem with ""treats"". As in he will give himself treats (usually food) when he feels like he deserves it, except that he gives himself treats sometimes every day. I'm the exact same way. I think my eating habits were fairly normal my first year of college but as I built up extra spending money, I would almost always spend it on treats. The dining hall had a separate convenience store that was open until 1 am. I would go down there and grab myself a drink and ramen or a sweet treat to munch on while I studied. I think this is where my food addiction began. I'm not even sure if I want to call it an addiction but I'm at a loss of another way to describe my situation. 

My second and subsequent years of college were cycles of trying to eat healthy and buying myself treats. I gained weight slowly at first and I began to grow out of clothes some of my more form fitting clothes. My boyfriend never (and still doesn't) makes me feel bad about my weight gain and has never shown any decline in his physical attraction to me since gaining weight, yet I would always hide treats from him. I would hide larger food items such as cookies in my dorm storage. Once we moved into separate apartments a year before moving in together, I would be sure to hide my food somewhere in my room or the kitchen when he visited and until he left. I never ate my most indulgent treats around him out of a baseless fear of being shamed. 

I gained weight most rapidly my junior and senior year of college. I began to grow at a rate that I developed dark stretch marks on my inner thighs. One of them was so deep that when I touched it I could feel the rip underneath my skin, though it didn't hurt. I got stretch marks on the undersides of my arms, inner thighs, hips, and chest (though I always had some as large breasts run in my family). This was when I was most aware of what I was doing to myself. At this point I was still working out by taking a yoga/pilates class, participating in an intramural sport during the fall semester, and going to the gym occasionally. This still didn't counteract my overeating. I was growing out my clothes quickly to the point that skinny jeans I bought a few months prior were too tight. Most my my weight has gone to my legs and chest. 

My weight gain has slowed down and I believe that is due to living with my boyfriend. I feel more internally accountable knowing that I am not only grocery shopping for myself but for my boyfriend as well. I try to make healthier meals and cut down on snacking.

Despite the shame I feel due to my weight gain, I have never been able or willing to push myself to lose more than 5 pounds. I have never purged nor restricted myself from eating. I'm ashamed that I've had thoughts of ""I could never be anorexic because I'm too addicted to food"". I'm not sure if I would consider my situation as an ED because I haven't spoken to a professional about any of this. 

Reflecting on times when I indulged excessively, I feel like I go into different severities of a haze. Within the last month I ordered Chinese food because a friend was coming over. I remember thinking that I would regret it after because they deliver such large portions that I save half of it for a meal the next day. I did that and while I briefly felt regret before opening to fridge to grab my leftovers the next day, I told myself ""fuck it, you already paid for it. Might as well eat it."" And immediately upon thinking that all regret washed away and I was visibly excited to curl up on the couch and eat my favorite food. I kind of also love to spend most of my time outside of work or house chores on the couch. I rushed to my bedroom to grab a pillow and blanket and excitedly sat on the couch and got a Netflix show ready to watch while I pigged out on Chinese food. 

Other times I will go to the store and view food only as price tags rather than calories/healthfulness. Yesterday I had to stop by Target to grab something to wear for an upcoming event and a few food essentials. I ended up grabbing my favorite ice cream mochi, a small jar of Nutella, two prosciutto wrapped cheese sticks, and a squeeze packet of almond butter. I ate the almond butter and cheese sticks in the car before leaving. I got two boxes of ice cream mochi (12 mochi total) and I have already eaten 8 in the past 24 hours. 

I started today off well by eating a salad with grilled chicken. I've only drank water because I made a conscious decision not to pick up soda when I went to Target (a small victory outweighed by all the snacks I bought). I had another salad and two pieces of toast for dinner because I felt too lazy to make anything else. I had room in my daily calorie goal to eat two mochi for dessert later. I ended up eating 4 mochi and two spoonfuls of Nutella. I feel like I shut myself off from feeling shameful about my poor eating choices sometimes. 

Despite seeing pictures of myself as I've gained weight and feeling shameful about what others must think of me, it's never pushed me hard enough to change. I can never stick to a 1,200 calorie diet for more than two days, sometimes I can't even make it one day. Sometimes I think I'm always hungry. I've noticed that when I scroll through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, I'm nearly constantly bombarded with thoughts of ""I remember when I was that skinny"", ""I wish I could go back in time and have my old body back"", ""I wonder what it's like to look good in all the latest fashion trends."" I feel like the worst part is that I still tell myself ""oh you've ~only~ gained 40ish pounds"" because I can technically fit into old tshirts. The main reason my tops don't fit is because my chest. My old favorite clothes probably could still fit somewhat if it weren't for my breasts. I feel like I just look dumpy in everything that used to be flattering on me. And it's not fun having a large chest. My posture has kinda sucked my whole life but I have to work at it so much harder because I have bad impulse control. And what's weird is that in the mirror at home I think I look fine but in pictures I almost can't stand to look at myself. I get tired just by walking long distances and I can't run a quarter mile (at my boyfriend's normal speed walking pace).  I know that I need to change my habits before I let myself gain even more. I'm bad at self control or pushing myself. I give up easily. I'm tired of feeling like this.",19May2019,1

I was born abroad a little over 18 years ago. My father had a 6th grade education, and my mother had an 8th grade education. My father is functionally illiterate. My mother had a difficult upbringing and was a delinquent in her youth, commonly shoplifting, drinking and doing drugs. 

My father didn’t like how I came out, and blamed my mother for how “white” I looked. 

My father wanted to leave when I was a baby, but ended up sticking around until I was 4, resulting in a nasty divorce.

My mom, due to her mental space and general personality, refused to work after I was 8, and started drinking heavily and doing drugs. She also started spending money on exorbitant trips via my great grandfather’s trust fund. I had been taken away from her several times due to her outbursts. 

Our financial situation was highly unstable. We’d been nearly evicted when I was 14 due to a bank transfer freezing all funds. When I was younger we had a different bank who regulated the funds a lot tighter than the last one. 

Eventually, the well run dry. When I was 17, we became homeless. I finished my 11th grade year online in Internet cafes, using the partially broken pc I had since 8th grade. 

My mom became addicted to cocaine and started stripping to make a living. I was usually alone at night, with my dog. She had no plans of furthering my education past 11th grade. She was going to file a 4140. I was assuming I’d get a GED maybe years later somehow. 

Later that year, I was taken by CPS for the fourth time in my life. First put into a group home, but they found a foster placement for me within a week. My foster parents suggested me attend regular school. At first I was hesitant because I was meant to be a senior and I missed the first quarter of school, as well as hadn’t been in a regular school since I was in 6th grade, but eventually I went along with it. 

I had to take multiple recovery courses as well as feel my way through.

I worked so hard to get in better shape so I can actually look good. I couldn't make gains no matter how hard I tried. Everytime I'd ask why on reddit, douchebags tell me I'm just not working hard enough.

Well, it's gotten to the point that I have chronic pain now from working out so hard. 

I also made hardly any gains even though I busted my ass, watched every calorie, and did everything right to the best of my ability.

The pain is the worst part. I look like shit because of genetics but that pain is there and won't go away now.

There's nothing left for me in life anymore.

Thanks to all you pieces of shit who told me it was just because I wasn't trying.",19May2019,2
87,"I have been hiding my problems for the last eleven years. Some friends knew some things, but my family know nothing. For years people have tried to encourage me to talk about it but I have never felt able to. I was recently discharged from a psychiatric unit, which I managed to stay in without my family finding out. But then, I don’t know what came over me today.. but I ended up posting everything on my social media. I feel liberated. 


“I have been arguing with myself for some time about posting this but, despite the stigma, I feel that it is important for me to have my voice heard and speak out. As some of you may (or may not) know, I have struggled with my mental health for some time. I have struggled with depression and self-harm. I have struggled with anxiety and panic attacks. I have had CBT and I am currently still taking antidepressants. It is not something I like to talk about openly - but I am beginning to realise that not talking about it, and saying “I’m fine”, adds to the problem. I count myself incredibly lucky to have such an amazing group of friends who have been there for me - and they have shown me that, even when everything seems hopeless, there is still more good to come. I cannot thank them enough for everything they have done, I truly feel blessed to have them. My journey is far from over, and I know there will be plenty more ups and downs on the way - but I now know I can handle whatever life throws at me, as long as I keep talking and stay connected to people. #endthestigma #mentalhealthawareness #timetotalk #depression #anxiety”",19May2019,7
88,"I met a someone in dec 2017 and we became friends. We messaged/snap each other everyday (they had left in january 2018 to go abroad for eight months), even skyped once. Around april i realized that i liked him a lot. He were the first person i ever truly like. Beginning of july he went cold on me. No more daily messaging, nothing. Yet they still posted on social media. I felt really hurt. I was too nervous to ask what had happen because we werent that close yet. I asked after 2.5 weeks and turns out something had happened which made him unable to come back to our country. I tried to be supportive and send him ittle messages everyday even though he wouldnt respond. Eventually i gave up and stopped it all. I decided i wouldnt message him unless he messaged me first.

Then from mid august to december he would message me once in a while. I never had asked why he went cold turkey because i didnt feel i had the right to. In January i realized that i wanted to know. We skyped and he told me it was because he were going through a stressful time. After talking for over 2 hours i had thought we would go back to what we had before talking everyday but nothing changed. 

Around March i decided to tell him (that i had feelings) because i would have regretted not doing so. I told him not to tell me his answer and lied that i used to like him when in reality i still hold some feelings (less than before). He was shocked but after that we were able to talk for another two hours. 

I had thought that he wouldnt message me after that but at the end of april he send me messages and we conversed. Not the everyday communication but once in a while again.

Tbh im still have some interested and i dont know if i can be friends but i dont want to lose him. I want him to be a part of my life still. What should i do?",19May2019,1
89,"So where I live (Italy), we celebrate with a really big party our 18th birthday (like a ""sweet sixteen""). Sometimes people like to have a theme for their party, like: black and white,  50' and so on , and people have to dress accordingly.
I've been invited to an ""asian/oriental"" themed 18th birthday. The host is really into kpop and eastern asian culture, but she's white. 
Now I don't really know what they mean by ""asian/oriental"" but I don't really feel comfortable wearing a quipao, sari, kimono or other traditional dresses. 
I think that most of my uneasiness comes from the host being white. If she wasn't white I would have been more comfortable because she had the ""right"" to wear a traditional dress from her country.
So let's say I do some research on traditional dresses and I understand what they mean, where they originated from and I genuinely appreciate it and decide to wear it for this party, would that be cultural appropriation?",19May2019,1
90,At my apartment complex there are adults who are developmentally disabled. They have home health aides come (infrequently) to supervise them. I’ve heard that some of these people have had their stove knobs removed for their safety and the safety of other residents. I see them wandering the halls occasionally and they obviously do not have the ability to bathe themselves. It just seems wrong for these people to be essentially on their own. Mental health services in this country (US) are absurd. I almost think that these complexes are taking advantage of these people. I have no way of know how they pay their rent. I assume they are on programs like SSI or SSDI. I don’t really know why I’m posting this besides just feeling bad for them in general. We just had some thunderstorms and even a tornado warning (it passed no real damage) and I wonder how they would be able to handle if something were to actually happen.,19May2019,1
91,"So, short version is that I got sick back in 2015, when I started high school, possibly due to mould. I had to drop out of two different schools and I can't visit most shops near me, because so many things cause flare-ups nowadays.

I've been trying to get a doctor's appointment for months, and I did actually get two different doctors, one in February and the other in April. Both of them were mostly fruitless. The first one was an older female doctor who didn't believe a word I said due to a lack of empirical evidence and implied everything was caused by my weight. Blood tests proved her wrong. The next doctor was an even older male doctor, who also believed my weight is to blame, until he saw the blood work. He cared more about my social wellbeing than my physical health, and nothing came out of that visit.

Now, after about half a dozen flare-ups later, I finally got an appointment with a doctor who I know knows about my situation, and realizes it's a genuine medical issue. The thing is, though, that I'm really nervous about it. I very rarely get nervous about anything, which makes this such a strange situation. If things pan out well, I... Genuinely don't know what'll happen. If they don't, I'll lose 25% of the monthly payments I now get. I already can't start my own independent life, so that would just make things worse than they already are.

I'm currently lying in bed, worrying about tomorrow, but glad to have found a place to vent. Wish me luck!",19May2019,1

93,"When all is well, home and healthy, prosperous and eyes on the next frontier, I just allow things to take their course with no care about which direction, it’s just like walking on clouds, and one is usually born walking on clouds. In these times as well, I don’t care what shape I am taking, more often than not I avoid being a person of distasteful demeanor. Being a human I don’t always succeed, I can only try again, on the next second, hour or day. On these times, I am just auto-piloting each day after the other, I rarely lookout and see over what ocean or mountain I am passing over. Life at its most complexity, a thing I wake up every morning to do, nothing more nothing less. 
People are a sizable part of this auto-piloting experience. I find great joy in the diversity of human character. Regardless of the partial continuation of any particular character (which is a healthy feature) it’s just interesting how I feel differently towards different people (or how they make me feel). Each person I meet, the question of who I am is postponed for another time, I get occupied with who they are. Some people I meet, they are so grand in spirit or otherwise, make me question who am I, and if I will ever be that great. This theme of me cruising my life can take years. I think I’ve been on autopilot since 2014, little odd to be specific about it however. 
Now it’s been almost a year since I last autopiloted. I went through changes in my life that couldn’t be just “cruised through.” Everything around me that I held dear or was of value to me somehow no longer was there. I was no longer able to rest my chin on my palm and say “aha, that sounds interesting” to something someone I cared about told me. 
It was me and the void of the universe, just gazing at me, and I wasn’t sure if it wanted to devour me or inviting me to ponder over its wonders. I had to make a decision an autopilot can’t make. Myself was nowhere to be found, shattered probably? If I had to collect its pieces, it was surely an impossible puzzle. 
I have previously made a decision and now the consequences have to be borne. I wasn’t ready for that. Walking back on this decision isn’t an option either. If I have made a series of bad decisions that led me to this one, sticking to it possibly will end this cycle of bad decision making (the most expensive lesson I’ve learned so far). 
So, what did it mean not auto-pilot? It pretty much meant that I had to know why I lived, and whether life was worth living or not. I am glad I had interesting people to talk to in my college years (and the years after), we talked about many things and among them these questions of the worthiness of life and the absurdity of its very existence (and ours as consequence). 
Now the challenge became how to actually go about my day in the absence of all that which made sense of it. 
If I am not busy with work, I am thinking about it. When I hike in the mountain, walk the streets, cycle between the villages, or even in my morning meditations, I was thinking about it. The more I did these activities I mentioned, the more I immerse myself in them the challenge became less challenging. Only then I began to feel comfortable with being “in control” again and with myself. 
I finally regained some balance and found new worlds in the books I’ve put aside earlier and started reading them which compensated the lack of the beautiful people of my life, and helped me see new ones. 
I wouldn’t say it’s a bed of roses now, but I am glad it happened. When auto-piloting, I was fading, whatever that constituted me and was proud of, was losing its fertile soil and withering. Sometimes you don’t need to get out of your comfort zone to find yourself (again), you need to obliterate that confront zone in order to do so. Only in the chaos and the havoc that were wreaked I was able to find myself. And in the absence of any ordinary reason to do so, I loved being alive.",19May2019,2

96,"~on mobile~

I’m a teaching assistant apprentice, and I love my job, but I can’t help feeling like I’m a waste of money in the classroom. I do phonics in the morning, and then interventions in the classroom, so I do feel like I have sort of a purpose, but beside that, I just feel like I’m worthless, annoying, constantly a pain to be around. 

I’m always asking my teacher &amp; coworkers for help because I am really unsure of things and I don’t want to get anything wrong, like if we’re setting up for the day, and I don’t know her new lesson plans, I’ll feel guilty for asking her to help, or I’ll feel annoying having to ask her for literally anything because she always closes her eyes and gives a little sigh before answering. I feel like I can’t do anything for myself &amp; I don’t seem to do stuff right, if I do try to do it without help. Does that make any sense? :( 

I’m pretty sure she wished she could have had the other apprentice in her class instead of me. They’re always joking and talking during break &amp; in the corridors, and she always seems happier around her. The other apprentice is 16 and she’s maybe 40? 
I just feel worthless. I have 2 months left and then I’m leaving as it’s the end of my contract, but all I can think about is how relieved she must be knowing I’ll be gone.

This is something I’ve been feeling for almost the entire year. I have had a little bit of time off due to university stuff &amp; sickness, and every time that I come back after having that time, she’s ALWAYS blunt/weird with me. 

I wish I could shake the feeling and tell myself not to care but I just do. I wish I was more fun to be around? or more helpful, more independent. At this point I don’t want to finish my course, I just want to quit because of how overwhelming this feeling is. 

I would seriously love &amp; appreciate any advice on how to deal with this, thank you",19May2019,1
97,"It sucked, legit felt like i was going to die for the whole time. Laughing hurt, coughing hurt, everything hurt.

 I don't wish it upon anyone.

Now, i don't know whether or not i had a Influenza first, but that's what we think.

The first symptoms appeared on Friday, they were loss of appetite, and fatigue. I remember coming home from school, and my grandma had come to visit us. Then i remember wanting to eat something, so i warmed up like a small pizza in a microwave, then i came back to my computer and just sat there, i took a bite, and it didn't feel like anything, then i just sat there, staring the pizza for a while thinking to myself ""wtf, am i becoming sick?"", then i just shoved the pizza in my mouth and forced myself to eat it. (I'm usually hungry after school, as i don't always eat there, so this wasn't normal)

The next day the first serious symptoms started appearing, 38-39c fever with terrible fatigue, muscle aches, dizziness and cough, we thought it was probably influenza starting up.

During the next week that i was sick, the temperature inside was like 25-30c, coupled with a fever, was hell.
I fell asleep on the couch alot of times, and woke up completely soaked in sweat, had to change shirts quite often.

I barely used any computer during the disease, just laid on the chouch, sleeping at times, other times watching the TV, best part of the day was when The Simpsons and Family Guy were broadcasted. Humor is always good when you're sick.

One day fever dropped and i felt good, went to school. Friends constantly told me to ""Go home, you're sick"", and i was like ""I'm fine don't worry."" (Apparently i looked very pale and sick) Came back home feeling very bad. In the evening, fever raised to like 40c. Also cough became worse, felt dizzy and all that. 

So the next day, my mom called the hospital and told them everything, they gave a appointment. 

Next day my condition worsened a bit. She called again, and told i was feeling worse, they gave a acute appointment(?) (basically a immediate appointment), and mom called me to tell that she's coming to pick me up.

Then we went to the hospital and walking to moms car when she came to pick me up, was such a challenge, felt like I was going to trip the whole time. was there for about 2 hours, they took blood tests, a swab test and a X-Ray. After all the hassle they  diagnosed me with Pneumonia, although some doctors said that it was both Pneumonia and Bronchitis. They gave me antibiotics which were like 850mg strong, and i had to **take 3 of them for a whole week.**

They gave me 2 weeks off school, (my summer break was about to start, otherwise it would've probably been alot more) and i chilled home. After a few days of antibiotics, i started to feel better, but in no way good, my ability to walk was still very bad. I barely got up in the morning to get the morning antibiotic, and then i went back to bed, and just fell asleep. But it was cool to have two extra weeks of break..

..Two weeks of extra break with a terrible dry and wet cough, that couldn't be controlled. The doctors told me not to use any sort of cough medicine. Apparently they can make the condition just worse, by not letting my body get rid of the mucus inside of the lungs.

Nights were the worst. I went asleep at my normal time. But i woke up an hour later, having some sort of cough outburst, which was so severe, that i had to sit up on my bed, to relieve it atleast a bit, or else i felt like i was gonna puke my guts out. All this continued on like **2-3 weeks** after the antibiotics, doctors told it was normal, so i didn't stress.

From what i remember, i didn't go to shower for like the whole 2-3 weeks of the disease, because i couldn't stand, and i lost like 7kg. (efficent weight loss if something. :D)

98,"Seriously, I feel like I'm losing a huge percentage of my daily existence (not to mention the 20 years before now). I feel kinda empty, I'm not sure how to put it into words.

100,"My relationship with my mum the last few weeks has gone from flawless to.. I don't know. It's problematic, to say the least. I feel like she's given me a pretty tough time any time we've had a conversation where I don't agree with her 100% or where I've suggested something else etc. She's seen me as being argumentative or defiant. She's raised her voice and called me disrespectful and arrogant. And most of this she doesn't agree with me because of her own anecdotal experiences and her ""40+ years"" of life experience.   

I'll choose two main problems that stand out. I've had an issue with sleep for a long time. And I've essentially narrowed it down now to the fact I'm an incredibly heavy sleep ( so it seems ) and I will not wake up with an alarm no matter how hard I try. I recently got a google home mini and using the much louder speaker on the Google home, and also setting around about 45 - 60 minutes of constant alarms, last week I was able to wake up independently for the entire week without my mum or dad coming in and waking me up or ringing me over and over until I pick up. Considering getting up is rough for me lately ( I get 8 hours, I have a fairly consistent sleep schedule - Bed bedtween 11 and 12.30 depending on the time im up the following morning ) my mum said she was very happy that i'd managed to do it. I thanked her and agreed but said at the end of the day the route of the problem still isn't solved. I still can't get up easily and I still sleep through so many alarms before waking up. My mum didn't seem to care. She seemed to think down stairs on time = problem solved. I said I wasnt happy and that I want to solve the route of the problem and not just make it look okay from the outside ie getting up on time. For whatever reason my mum took offence to this. She went on a whole rant about how wanting to sleep at 2 or 3 or 4 in the morning is normal and how she fucking wishes she didn't have to be up to make sure I'm up and how she wishes she could lie in bed like the lazy shit I am till 10 every morning ( For the record I don't sleep in till this time, even on weekends most days ) and just went on a whole rant about how I shouldn't only get 4 hows sleep and how I should train myself to wake up with an alarm ( I've tried this for 7 years, I don't wake up with alarms). The whole reason I brought this up - about solving the route of the problem - was so in a week or twos time if I was to fall back into normal of not being able to get up with alarms, my mum wouldn't be getting mad. What's the point in just masking a problem, right? She didn't agree. We had a full blown 20 - 30-minute argument about this for no fucking reason and It felt like she was just going for the sake of it, changing topics and ignoring my questions by just telling me to fuck off whenever she couldn't answer something. It ended with her telling me to fuck off to my room because I was ruining her alone time and how she was never going to compliment me getting up in the mornings again. Whoopee. 

This same argument had happened twice previously and her whole motive was convincing me I don't have an underlying condition that may be causing my rough mornings because she has 40 years of life experience and goes through it all the time and there is nothing wrong with her and I'm just a teenager who loves sleep and is being pedantic. 

&amp;#x200B;

The second reason for an argument - once again, sort of sleep related. I recently got my first car, and me and my parents had agreed that whenever I am out earlier in the morning to school, I would wake up around 45 minutes before I leave to give me time to wake up and be alert. This is completely understandable and I myself wouldn't feel comfortable leaving 20 minutes or so after waking up. So, my mum reminds me she would like me to do that the next week and how I need to get into a habbit of waking up early because when I get a job I won't be able to tell them I'll be in an hour later because I don't want to be up. I told my mum 1) I don't get a choice as to what time I get up for school now, I'm in when I'm timetabled for, and 2) I don't see much point personally in getting up ""Early"". I just see it as adapting to my schedule. This including being up at an appropriate time in which I will be alert and ready to leave at a certain time in order to make it to a said destination - let it be a trip, school, or a job. My mum didn't agree and said I just need to learn to get up early. In no argumentative tone whatsoever, I suggested that getting up early would not help if I worked a job with a shift such as 8pm - 4am, or something similar. She said that my scenario was completely irrelevant and I had no point. She seemed to be getting annoyed for whatever reason. I told her that I felt it was relevant because getting up early wouldn't help me in situations like that however being able to adapt to my schedule would do. Being able to plan around a job like would be much more relevant than a simple ""Being awake early"" so I stated that I'd prefer to just keep a schedule at the moment that is comfortable with school and not ""Get up early"". My mum for god knows why took this as me ""Defying her requests"" to get up 45 minutes or so before I leave and my essentially saying I wouldn't get up on time and I would go to bed at ridiculous times and try and squeeze by on little sleep and get up at the last minute before leaving. She raises her voice, she starts shouting, talking over me and saying how shes fed up with my shit constantly and how she cant have a conversation without shit and how it always so arrogant talking to her and every time she wants her alone time watching tv or whatever me and all my shit come along and ruin it. Not forgetting here that I don't go to her over things like this. She is always the one who raises the topic. I state multiple times throughout these conversations that I'm not arguing, I'm not trying to, I see it as a normal conversation or a debate at most where we share our thoughts and opinions up until my mum gets heated over seemingly made up facts that I've said. If I question her to repeat where I state things like not wanting to get up, leaving last minute, I only get a couple of hours sleep, she will never respond. She literally tells me to fuck off or changes the point completely. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is a long read but It's really getting to me. I want to talk about this with my mum but I just feel like me going to her about these arguments is literally asking for another one by her standards. I don't want to say I disagree with anything to her at the moment because she's just going to take offence and start an all-out brawl because she sees me disagreeing or having my own opinion as being an argumentative arrogant son of a bitch right now. My mum has never been like this. She's always been so open and so helpful with so many things and I've always been able to discuss things without arguments arising. All of a sudden it's just changed and we have something stupid like 7 big arguments in 14 days, 3 of them being in the last 4 nights. I want to avoid her and stay away but then I'll get the whole ""Stop being ignorant"" shit from her. I just don't know what to do because she'll go and tell all this bullshit to my dad, and I'll get crap off him too and when I tell him what happens he just responds with things like ""Well that's what your mum is like, she's like it with me all the time and I put up with it"". She has never been like this with me, whether she is with my dad or not. It breaks my heart because I don't know how she feels about me or what she thinks of me.. It genuinely seems like she outright dislikes me right now and just finds any excuse to have a dig but I just really dont know.",19May2019,1

* age 22-28 
* Not obese, not really skinny either
* in the USA (sorry I can't afford international travel)
* HIV negative, no STDs

**Habits/Personality:**
* All recreational substances should be kept to an absolute minimum if partaken in at all. Hard partiers, addicts, alcoholics, and stoners need not apply. 
* Having a few FwBs occasionally is okay, but no slutting around please. And use protection. 
* No gym rats. As odd as this sounds. Exercise takes away from time that could be spent with me instead! :3 (body genetics should naturally prevent you from obesity; otherwise, diet) 
* Introverts required- NO EXTROVERTS. If you have a lot of friends, like to go out often, like adventures IRL, etc., we're not a match. If you like staying in all day and have little to no IRL friends, good. 
* Don't have long term goals for success in life. Be a basement dwelling loser so we have more in common. ;3
* Must love physical affection and snuggles. uwu It's very important. 
* NO FLAMBOYANT GUYS. You know what I mean. The stereotypical ""yaaasss"" drag queen loving loud obnoxious ones. None of that. Voice chat required so to confirm you're not one. 
* I don't like guys too ""masc"" or ""fem"". I like the middle ground that gay men seem to be unable to do (I can do it though!). 
* Sex drive should be moderately low. No more than once a day, if even that. Not really into anal penetration but if so, be vers/bottom because I don't like to bottom usually. 
* Politically- should be economic left wing (basically want the USA to be like other highly developed nations with good healthcare and education and public transit etc.), but no ""social justice"" or idpol stuff please. x_x I hate that shit. You should love white males. 
* Should enjoy (or at least tolerate) cute and somewhat childish things. Examples: kid-friendly video games like Kirby or Yoshi, smiley faces on clothing, idk what else. 
* Be open to genres of music. I am a big pop fan, but not a flamboyant one. 

I'll add more if I think of it.

(Of course i knew she had one) Until one day they had a fight and she was like my bf..blah blah blah and i was like ooh you have a bf?! Fast forward a couple of months and we are now hanging out all afternoon monday thru friday for the next two months. We were basically fuck buddies or FWBs i guess. 


We wouldnt really talk sat n sun because thats the time she spend with him, well i guess i couldnt handle the “us not talking” for two days and called her out on it because come monday i would all of a sudden “exist.” I basically treated her like a gf; kissing, holding hands, making out, fucking, i/she would spend the night etc and she would obviously treat me the same but in private 🙄 anyway we would always end up fighting on the weekends over this and make up monday after talking about her neglecting me. Things would come up like her feelings for me were “strong” she couldnt live without me, nobody makes her laugh like i do or pleasures her like i do.



Last Thursday we were supposed to hangout BUT she ditched me to hangout with her boyfriend, she said she wasnt with him but i found out through a mutual friend it was a lie. Soooo i told her ive had enough and that it was either him or me and she chose him so i blocked her from snapchat and fb leaving her with a simple “if you need me you have my number and thats all you need. Come look for me if you decide to make the right choice” basically now im really depressed i have no one to hangout with, no warm feeling of holding someone, those relationship feelings(even though we werent anything) i cant get her out of my head, it hurts. I dont know what to do.",19May2019,2

109,"After struggling with depression and anxiety and so long of not feeling like myself for so long, moving countries, trying to kill myself, I've recently started feeling better, got a new job that even though it's not as challenging it's quite rewarding. I've decided I want to better myself. I want to start finding my way back into my future, I want to be proud of myself. I have recently gone back into hobbies like woodworking, cultivating mushrooms, doing various fermentation projects.  might start a bio technology course in the beginning of next year. I'm starting to feel excited for the future for the first time in a long time.",19May2019,7
110,"Ok where do I start in all of this. My family life is not great but it’s also not bad. All of my siblings are older then me by like 19 years and I’m really frustrated with them. I might be 13 turning 14 in like 4 days but I’m not stupid. Lets start with my oldest sister, let’s call her Ava. So Ava doesn’t do anything at all she’s 32, no job, has 2 kids, has an ass of a husband, (they are getting a divorce soon I think) and on top of that she’s an alcoholic and she’s not all there. I know she’s my sister but she’s not the best on my mental health. She puts me down and makes me feel small and stupid. Her kids are even worse. Her oldest son is 12 let’s call him jimmy. Jimmy tells me horrible things and doesn’t treat me with respect. He tells me to go kill myself a lot. I know when people are joking trust me but, he’s not, he will hold his fist in the air crying calling me an ignorant bitch and a down right whore. He’s an ass all the damn time. He has a lil brother and he is following his footsteps. Let’s call him Andy. Andy tells me I’m the worst aunt in the world and that I’m stupid. This coming from a 4 year old hurts my feelings a lot cuz I try to be the best aunt that’s I can be but I can’t when those two make it so damn hard to even sit at the dinner table with them. When I try to talk to my mom about it she shuts me out and starts telling me that they have a horrible life and they aren’t doing good but, that doesn’t make it right to call me an ignorant slut and get away with it. My mom always turns it around to her and tells me why her life sucks and her job is shit and I’m lucky to even have a family. My other sister I don’t have anything bad to say but she’s just in a bad place rn and has a shit boyfriend. They have an awesome lil boy together and I love him to pieces but, they are just toxic together. They have a love hate relationship :/ it’s not the best but they work things out even if they have to leave for a couple days and then say I’m sorry. My brother, he’s a cool dude he’s getting his way through university and he’s gonna be a lawyer but he wants to move to Colorado and that makes me feel really bad cuz he’s the only person in the family who’s not clinically insane. My dad well he’s the best. He was an alcoholic a lil bit ago but he’s been 4 1/2 years sober and I’m so proud of that. Cuz he was an alcoholic he drank his liver away and had to go through surgery and all of that other shit. I’m just sick and tired of being here. I just want to know what’s it’s like to be able to sit at a dinner table and be asked what did you do today instead of getting told I’m in arrogant asshole who has no future. Oh and my sister Ava is like that cuz she got handed everything she wanted. And I mean every thing I could make a list of things. My parents treat her like she’s 16 so she doesn’t start world war 3. I’m just sooooo done at this point. I’m just ready to leave and move out. I can’t wait for college at this point. 

Also I’m sorry for the strong language I know I’m 13 but it’s a habit.",19May2019,1
