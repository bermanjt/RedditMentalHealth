2,"Only brief information about us: We actually came to Gainesville, Florida, in 2001 from Iran, I was only a few months old and we came to the United States because my father got a good job offer here that he couldn't refuse. Sadly my father passed away in 2006 due to speeding. My mother raised me alone and worked really hard to give me a good life as possible. We used to own a gym before, so mom would always train there, she cared alot about her body and health, she has a very good athletic body, she is also quite tall, 5ft10, which helped here strength even more. Today (2019) I am 18 years old and my mother is 44 years old. The guy that is also involved is 19 years old.

&amp;#x200B;

So it goes back to April of this year (2019), when my mother's best and closest friend Linda came over to our house, she had a young guy named Garry with her. Mom served coffee and we all sat in the kitchen, I usually do not attend when guests come over, but Linda came with a stranger, a male, so I couldn't leave. Linda's son is a year older than me, but a good friend of mine. She first presented Garry to us, said that he was a friend of her son, and has recently moved in to a area here in Gainesville, close to our house. He left his parents to live on his own because he had gotten a new job here.  Then she started talking to my mom about a trip she, her son, his girlfriend and Garry would go on, and Linda tried to persuade mom to go with them.

&amp;#x200B;

The trip was to Ibiza, and they would stay there 4 weeks, mom refused and explained that she couldn't join them on this trip because of me, because my graduation was in May. So Linda told mom that they could stay 2 weeks instead, mom was still unsure, but after a long discussion and pressure by Linda and Garry, mom finally accepted. I wasn't pleased because I didn't like the idea of my mom traveling to another country alone and with men in the trip as well. Garry was quiet but stared at my mother very much, I felt quite uncomfortable. They then left and I talked with my mom about this trip and she told me that it wasn't a big deal, she also spoke to our next door neighbors and made sure they would check on me now and then.

&amp;#x200B;

I drove mom to the airport, hugged her and wished her a safe trip. She met with the the rest of the company and they all left. This 2 weeks were a pretty hard, I wasn't used to be separated from mom. But I focused on school because it was not so much left, and I wanted to graduate with as good grades as possible. I called mom a few times the first week, from what I learned, she was happy. Then a picture from Linda's son's mobile was sent to me, it was a picture of them in the beach, I was surprised when I saw the picture. Linda, her son and his girlfriend were standing close to each other with their hands over each other's shoulders, then a few meters away, my mom stood with Garry, she had her hand on her hip and Garry had his arm around her shoulders. What made me disappointed and very annoyed was how close he stood next to her and that the others were in a place while Mom and Garry were a few meters away. I tried to not make a huge deal out of it so I forgot about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I got a call from my mom, she told me that they would arrive tomorrow, early in the morning, she told me that she didn't need a ride home because they would all order an uber. The next day when I woke up I heard sounds coming from downstairs. I quickly dressed and walked down, there I saw my mom drinking coffee and chatting with Garry, they were laughing out loud and smiling. I joined them, it felt very awkard with him in our house, then I asked what he was doing here, and mom replied that he came over because he wanted to borrow something and that she invited him in for coffee. I just nodded and drank.  He then left and I started talking strictly to my mother, where I said that he can not come over, that he has nothing to do here, if he wants to hang out with me he should come to me.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day when I was driving back home from school I noticed Garry walking on the side of the highway, he walked out of the area where I live, and it was strange, because he doesn't live here so it was abnormal for him to go here. I then got an idiotic thought that he maybe was at my house, but that was impossible I thought, my mother would never invite a stranger in to the house if I'm not home. I got home, mom was in the shower, I went upstairs to my room. When mom got out of the shower I asked her if someone came to our place, she said no.

Then the day was here, I graduated, I had very good grades and mom looked very happy and proud. Linda and her son were there, they both congratulated me. Then Garry came, he greeted us all and hugged Mom, I saw Linda grinning strangely.

&amp;#x200B;

Then came two very calm months, (June and July) where I did nothing, then in the beginning of August Linda's son and some of our other friends decided that we would travel to Mexico and be there for a week, Mom looked incredibly happy, normally she usually doesn't like me going anywhere alone without her. The thing that worried me while I was there, was mom, she was alone. When I got back from Mexico while driving back home, I saw Garry, this time, leaving my house, he closed the door and left. I was shocked, the thought of a stranger in my mom's house and she is allowing it made me angrier. I walked in and mom immediately hugged me, Linda was also there. That was a big relief for me. Then almost every single day I saw Garry always walking out of our area, I didn't suspect anything then, because I thought he went to Linda's house. Then for almost 2 weeks ago, I walked in to the house, mom was not there, I could tell, because her shoes wasn't there, I then saw that Linda was there, talking on the phone. I tried to calmly and slowly walk up to my room so that I don't have to greet her, while walking upstairs I heard Linda talking with somebody over the phone, it looked like she was talking to a male and was congratulating him for getting the woman he wanted. I understood nothing and kept walking up to my room.

&amp;#x200B;

Later that day I had work, so I drove, but took a different road this time, a quicker one. While driving I saw a woman, looking exactly like my mother leaving a house, she kissed the guy that was walking her out and hugged him, then started walking away, I started to feel an emptiness and fear inside of me, I had to know something. The day after when mom left the house, I followed her from behind, without her knowing it. We walked a bit, then reached a house, she went to the house and just opened the door and walked in, the door was open, so I walked in after her. I wished that I would never see what I saw, and I hope that no one will ever see what I saw. As I was walking to the room there, I saw my mom making out with Garry, then he laid her on the bed and they both started undressing themselves, I couldn't watch and left the house. I have never felt this abandoned, forgotten, betrayad and destroyed.

&amp;#x200B;

So I have known mom's dark secret for about 2 weeks, i'm a hundred percent sure that they have been sleeping with each other for a long time, since that trip to Ibiza in April, I believe. Mom doesn't know that I already know everything, and I haven't spoken to her yet, so I turn to you people here in reddit for help and your advice on what to do, because I don't know what to do, I need help to figure it out, I hope you all can help me during this difficault time.",18Sep2019,1

0700AM Start my motorcycle, turns out it has ran outta gas. No biggie, I'm just gonna drag it to a nearby gas station.

0730AM Haven't eaten yet and also skinny (thanks depression) and it is heavier than expected. But the gas station is sort of downhill. Great, I can simply ride it downhill on neutral gear like a boss.

0745AM Gas filled. Motorcycle still won't start. Shit... ok chill! No biggie. Just gonna drag it back to the house. Then I'm gonna book a Grab (Uber's cousin) to the hospital.

0750AM Oh fuck we have to go uphill.

0800AM Dragging it through traffic in the middle of the haze but for some reason grinning at everyone like an idiot. It's a fucking struggle though!

0820AM Out of breathe but I make it. Go to shower, drink soybean milk.

0830AM No Grab ride available for 30 minutes straight.

0900AM Fuck it. I'm just gonna go to sleep instead.

0905AM Let's tell it to reddit. My story is all over the place but heh, maybe a person or two are gonna read it.

I'm going to bed. It feels good to let that out. Things will get better soon. I shouldn't even be here anymore but I still am so what have I to lose. :)",18Sep2019,1
9,"My best friend is a victim of sexual abuse. We discuss the effects it’s had on her and she’s very open to me about it. I love her so much and it hurts me to see how this event shaped her whole life. She told me 4 years ago, and when it happened I didn’t know her. We only became friends in college.

This past weekend, one of my cousins confided to me that she was sexually abused by our uncle. It broke my heart bc I was there when it happened (granted we were both very young) and I see this uncle a lot. I feel sick to my stomach that this had been going on for years and I had no idea...I don’t know how to be around him anymore.

After knowing this, I’m just wondering how I should deal with it. I take on other people’s emotions easily, and I can’t stop crying. I can’t believe she has been going through this for so long and I had been dumbly sitting there for years. People had been classifying my cousin as “crazy” just bc she was drinking, doing drugs, etc but in reality this was just a way of dealing with her abuse. 2 people very close to me have been dealing with the effects of sexual abuse , and now I’m just fucking angry.


I’m scared to tell anyone about my stress bc I don’t want my cousin and friend to think i think it’s about me. It’s not about me, but knowing this info has really affected me. I don’t know what to do. If anyone has been in a similar situation to me, or you’re a victim yourself, please send help :)",18Sep2019,1

14,"I split from a neglectful, manipulative person a few weeks ago, we'd been dating for almost 7 months.
He basically would ignore me, not respond for hours to any of my messages, never initiate conversations or make plans to hang out. It was al

ways me taking on that role, I knew in the very beginning we probably wouldn't make it a year, but I ignored these problems in hopes they'd go away.

But ignoring problems *doesn't* make them go away (shocker, I know), it actually made them worse.
I became fed up and I finally confronted him the day before I dumped him, we didn't argue, I told him everything that bothered me and how I never spoke up because I cared about his feelings. Long story short, he made himself the victim after not responding for an hour and everything began to make sense.

I finally started exposing some of our conversations to friends and even a family member and every. single. person. sided with me, they were all really surprised I had even ignored it for so long.

Anyway, ever since the breakup, I find it hard to care anymore. I miss physical affection and intimacy, so I'm willing to go to a wide range of people to satisfy these desires even for a few days, just something to numb the pain a bit.
People I don't feel any romantic or sexual attraction towards are suddenly on my list, and I find myself unable to care when it comes to things like kissing. I just... don't have any respect for myself anymore. After months of being a sex doll I'm willing to do it for someone else.
I want to stop feeling this way, the desperation, the want to do something so wrong.
Any advice helps, I know I'll be called a slut and a whore but I haven't acted on any of this. It's a mindset I'm suddenly stuck in, I just need help.

I'm not talking about homeless addicts or crazy criminals, I'm talking about normal people who just kind of have a sucky life. 

Elizabeth is a woman who I've known for quite some time. She goes to the therapist. She's in her late 20s. She has graduated college with a liberal arts degree. She works a very low paying job. She comes off as intelligent and socially mature. Behind it all, she is toxic and manipulative. She will leave passive-aggressive notes in places she knows you'll go, with messages intended to hurt you. Very odd. She believes she is very uncomfortable talking and strongly prefers writing, however she is a perfectly capable talker and there are no evident problems. She simply doesn't like to talk about a very large selection of things-- things that have anything do with her feelings, her mistakes, her past, or her thoughts. This is due to a mixture of insecurity, denial, and manipulation. She tells lies to everyone she meets about everyone else she's met, to portray herself well. She is unable to see past what is to her own benefit-- and thus is not used to conventional ideas of good and bad, how her actions affect others, or why she should tell the truth. The primary thing she is concerned about is appearance-- appearing mentally healthy, physically attractive, and socially well-versed. She's very good at it in short periods, and she has never had a long-term relationship. Over the years I have learned that there is no trauma behind her behavior. I can imagine there is a genetic pre-disposition to her behvaior however I see so much more explanation from the way she was brought up. Her parents were upper-middle class, money was never a problem, the father and mother were nice. Elizabeth had a typical youth experience. The only real difference is that she could go lie to her father to solve most problems. This is the foundation for the rest of her issues. From an early age she was conditioned in the following ways: if she had any kind of problem with other children she played with, then by lying to her father she would validate her own behavior. Thus she never had to acknowledge her own behavior, or face consequences. When she was having a financial problem, she would practice her acting skills and manipulate the father for assistance. When she 

If you let her be toxic for a very long time while simply remaining unphazed, she will eventually boil over and say ridiculous things ina  bout of anger. After that point, she is forced, by her own mind, to realize her behavior, and for a brief moment she is an actual normal person. But the second she goes to apologize, she has already resumed the ubiquitous deceiving that is the mark of her neurosis.

I believe this behavioral pattern described in the preceding paragraph has been playing out in fractal form across the span of her life. A few years after her graduation from college, something happened with her and her father. She changed, she never speaks to her father anymore except in settings where it is expected, such as a communal wedding. She never visits him, but she speaks of him with respect, albeit very, very briefly. The father had had enough of his daughter lying to him, and asking for assistance. He called her out and said no more. That's when she started to change. 

The problem she has is that her life was too easy.",18Sep2019,1
23,"Am I insane or do the last mature people complain about the maturity of others.

I'm primarily talking about myself like I'm in college band in the pit. And last week we had some drama about this one really rude girl who was continually upset about the vibe section who couldn't nail a part like the marimbas (her section. And can I just say, girl, you are Marimba 4/5, don't act like you're the cream of the crop okay?)

Anyways, when one of the Vibes, who's a really sweet girl and really hard to upset, finally got to her breaking point, Vibe just said ""just so everyone in the pit knows, I'm not trying to call anyone out, but it's incredibly disrespectful to huff and puff when my section can't nail a part. We are frustrated too, maybe more than you are."" This was the inciting incident, then everyone came out with their gripes that they had been holding in all season about various people (and I would be lying if I said I wasn't LIVING for Rude Girl to be called out so many times in one day. She's been rude and on my nerves all season. So fucking negative, sure got the brunt of it.)

This is not the problem. The problem came AFTER the gripe session. At the very end of the session when everyone got their feelings out, this one boy, BRIAN, said ""are y'all done?? All you do is complain! If we want to get better we need to set our feelings aside and just play. This is some high school shit like y'all are bring so dramatic. I signed up to be in a COLLEGE band not a HIGH SCHOOL- no actually this is some MIDDLE school who likes who shit. Like can't we just be mature""


FIRST OFF *BRIAN*, our feelings needed to be aired out! What do you want us to hold them in and resent each other??? 

That's something I'm starting to hear more and more, is grown adults saying ""all this drama is for high schoolers or little kids"" like no??? Why is it immature to have feelings and to eventually really about them?? I'm a very emotional person but I get my shit done. Does that make me immature?

Also why do adults have to be mature all the time?? No adult is going to be mature all the time. In this specific instance, we come to rehearsal, we literally get our objectives done and OBJECTIVELY we sound PREETTY FUCKING GOOD IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF (and I do, not the brag😉) 

But like if Rude Girl is being a huge bitch to everyone who messes up one time when she's 4th chair marimba out of 5 (and the 3rd marimba is a FRESHMAN) it is not DRAMA or IMMATURE for someone to put her in her place. It is not DRAMA or IMMATURE to be upset that someone (who has no right to) is treating you poorly, to be upset that you're being treated poorly. You can handle something immaturely but simply expressing your feelings is actually so mature and a lot of people can't DO that! Like I commend people who can do it in a calm way! Bc I sure as hell can't. That's why I'm ranting in Reddit instead of going off on Brian bc if I had said something during circle time I wouldn't have shut up.

And that's another thing BRIAN, LITERALLY, like I'm not joking, this morning you farted and laughed about it. What the fuck!! Is it mature i get a girlfriend and then not be about to do anything with other females or get weird when anyone brings up a girl that isn't your girl? That's pretty fucking immature and annoying to me. I'm sorry this is not a rant about Brian. 

But anyways, what do you guys think about that? Like what exactly is maturity? What is drama? Why is it a ""childish"" thing?

alright *I* may not be mature and *I* may be dramatic lol but I'm mature enough to acknowledge that. And I'm mature enough to acknowledge that the kids in my section work really hard and are so mature during rehearsal that I'm always so fucking bored! Like what do you mean we aren't mature Brian?? What do you mean!",18Sep2019,1

31,"Hey Reddit! 

So about three months ago, I graduated from school, and was dumped by my ex of about 18 months very shortly after. It just about killed me... I was really struggling for a while. I spent the time working on myself, my career, and the friendships that I have here in my new city. It wasn't until about a week ago that it finally clicked - I'm really happy. I then heard from friends that my ex started dating someone very shortly after the breakup, has been partying her ass off, trying to hook up, etc.. This would have absolutely devastated me had I heard several months ago, but honestly, it gave me the closure I needed, and for that I am thankful. 

&amp;#x200B;

During this time I have done so well for myself. I finally reached my goal of getting under 200lbs, paid down all my short term debt, got a lot more involved with my career and made some big progress there, joined a kickball team, grew stronger in my faith, and overall got a lot closer with the friends I have here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, tonight was pretty great. I went on a date with someone really cool. I didn't want to date after the breakup, and I didn't want to try and force anything.. but this came up organically and honestly made me so happy. She seemed to really enjoy herself too, and we have plans to go out again later this week.

32,"We broke up about 3 or 4 months ago, and the way we met and began dating is unconventional. We've agreed to remain in each other's lives permanently, but of course, our relationship will probably always be wonky. I'm incredibly close with her parents and sister that we can't cut each other off even if we wanted to, which we don't. It's been an awfully strange time for me and I've taken up habits both good and bad to deal with it. I've learned a lot about myself and what I want to do with my life. I look forward to my future with optimism and yet there is an ominous cloud above me that I can't fully understand. I mentioned that  what happened over the weekend because I think something within me clicked and I'm unsure what it is. I feel like I have more closure in regards to the relationship, but there's something else that's not sitting right with me. I don't think it has anything to do with her. Most people I know are going through a weird or hard time right now and it's hard to turn to anyone. I know some of them are going through a rougher time so I don't want to bother them with my nonsense. I know we'll all be fine in the end in some way. Idk how strict the mods are, but thank you for anyone who reads this drunken mess. Appreciate ya",18Sep2019,2
33,I was fine not to long ago but lately I've been feeling different and I honestly don't know who tf I am anymore I feel like I'm a totally different person on the outside like I'm two different people and I don't know who I really am. Does anybody else experience this? Where they feel like they're putting on a show for everyone and forgot who they really are? I don't know what to do and I barely trust myself. I need help.,18Sep2019,3
35,"almost everything is usually about me. i'm very pure sometime with people and i love giving gifts and i wish i could be rich mainly because i want to give those i love everything they want.... because they'll worship me as a result (and also because they'll be happy). 

i can easily be extremely cruel if you push me and i may reflect or even regret it afterwards, but i'll do it time after time. i can so easily identify your weak points when i get to know you and if i wanted to i could verbally erode you. 

in relationships, i am so selfless. if we are both committed to each other and there arent any games i would give my soul for the girl. i fall easily and deeply. 

sometimes im selfless and even naive. im extremely charming and i can talk my way out of most situations and get almost everyone to like me quickly. but sometimes if i'm triggered i can be so mean and have absolutely 0 regard for your feelings if my feelings are hurt badly enough.",18Sep2019,1
36,"I have been diagnosed with PTSD in the past from a sexual assault but since then I feel like it's all gotten worse. One of my professors posted mental health resources on his class site and one of the links was for mental health screening. I've had some sneaking suspicions so I decided to take them and it said I'm highly likely to have severe depression and anxiety as well as the PTSD I already knew about and there's a moderate chance I am bipolar as well as being at risk for developing an eating disorder. Almost got a 100 (lol) but I don't have any substance abuse problems. I plan on going to see a free campus therapist tmrw cause I don't really want to be self diagnosing. 

Not sure what I'm hoping to accomplish by posting this but oh well. I don't want to be that friend putting all her issues on everyone else so reddit gets them instead.",18Sep2019,8
37,"My friends categorize me as a social butterfly. Some days, I agree with them. However, I'm completely different when I'm around guys who I'm romantically invested in. 

I become very shy when I start dating someone. I become insecure about everything about myself. I overthink stupid things like ""No, don't wear that outfit. He wants to be seen in public with a pretty girl, not a sloppy girl"" or ""don't send him that song, he'll think it's lame and that you have bad taste"" ""he's out of your league."" 

I start to lose confidence in communicating. I start to worry that what I'm about to say isn't as witty or as funny as I thought it would be so I just stay quiet. I lose all ability to carry a conversation because I worry I'll bore him about topics I like. I start to hide my hobbies and interests because I'm afraid he'd reject them. 

These are all irrational thoughts, I see it. But I don't know how to stop it. And it's literally killed my relationships. They start to lose interest because they no longer feel like their connecting with me. I stop engaging with them  and they start to pull away because I've become so awkward and quiet. 

The last couple guys I've dated were incredibly unique and special. Perhaps that's why I was so intimidated and my anxiety went through the roof with them. And my anxiety let them slip away because I didn't know how to let myself interact with them. I know 100% that if I was just my normal self, they'd be in my life today. 

Why am I like this? This isn't normal, right?",18Sep2019,5

40,"Hey Reddit... literally just download you about 3 minutes ago for the sole purpose of throwing this thought into the trenches of the internet... 

I’ve just completely uprooted my life, and it was an awesome decision . I’ve left a lot of toxic, manipulative and torturous people in my wake. But now, I’m all alone. And I don’t know why this fucking surprised me so much.

Of course I’m alone. 

I just ran away from everything that was familiar and safe and planned.  Which was completely the goal. And now that I’m here, in this new place, with a roof over my head, food in the fridge and air I can breath guilt/responsibility/obligation free.... 

What the fuck do I do now??? 

Like obviously get a job...  find a friend and maybe a bar or coffee shop to haunt... but like while that’s all happening... while everything is getting all figured out.... 

What do I do with this loneliness? 
I’ve never felt this before.  This complete void of human contact and sense of community or belonging ... idk... shouldn’t be a shock... shouldn’t be so hard to deal with but I’m kind of lost in it. 

And I don’t know where else to turn or who I can reach out to so...

43,"Don't wanna go into to many details but I made a lot of bad decisions on top of failing college and all of that together has left me with an unimaginable amount of debt and pitiful credit.

Any advice anyone ever gives is basically ""grind and dedicate your entire waking life to working and paying off the debt for the next 5+ years and it'll be horrible but you have to""

For ""normal"" people that's already terrible. For someone who doesn't even wanna be alive at all, realizing that the best case scenario is your life is miserable for many years, completely separate from depression. I'm gathering that even if I were mentally healthy then my life would suck. Literally no way out of it.

If I woke up in the morning and was magically at 100% functionality and had the happiness to take on the world then my life would still be shit.

Its not even a matter of not being able to escape depression anymore it's just a matter of not being able to escape my life at all.",18Sep2019,1

45,"I looked online for anything talking about people who feel suicidal over debt or financial problems. It honestly made me feel worse though because in my specific case I could counter every one of their points.

1. The problem isn't that I'm sticking my family with the debt.



2. I've read the fine print on my specific loans and my FAMILY including cosigners would be ok. My student loans including private would be entirely forgiven on the event of my death. Same with my medical and credit card debt.




So the site doesn't help. It makes me feel worse because what are proposed as solutions or at least counters don't apply to me, so I have even more reason to feel how I do",18Sep2019,1
46,"In my home country it’s really normal for girls to have arm hair, like seriously no one cares it’s just arm hair and besides girls normally have way less arm hair then guys do, however I have moved countries and have been staying here for a bit over a year and plan on only staying about another year till I leave for college and like this group of guys keeps saying I should shave my arms and I keep standing my ground and saying it’s normal and it’s not something I should be ashamed of since it’s normal for everyone to have arm hair and since I don’t even have that much then I shouldn’t be ashamed of it but like seriously they are pushing it they kept pestering me, like today they did it for like 10 minutes saying how I should get ride of it, then they stopped for like 5 minutes and then went at it again for another 10 minutes at which point they even stopped other people and asked their opinion seriously this kinda sucks since I like one of the guys and he keeps saying how no one is going to like me in here if I have arm hair, I don’t think Im gonna give in and shave my arms but I was wondering if I’m in the wrong or if it’s them?",18Sep2019,2
47,"i can admit this was my fault -- i let my grades at university slip to the point where i was forced to take a semester off for poor academic performance. i slaved to hard in high school to get in the top university in my country just to have this happen. i scored at least mid nineties across the board. studied months nonstop for the SATs. now this. i had big goals, im doing neuro for undergrad, but now i just feel pathetic.

truth to be told, i have been working on auto pilot, dissociating constantly. i think it was a coping method for the drastic circumstances i'd been through-- it was my first year in the country, my mom escaped here from my extremely narc/abusive dad, and he also cut me off financially, meaning i lost all my previous comforts and live on minimum wage. on top of that i have a chronic fatigue disorder that i can't afford to treat, as well as a nearly two hour commute, so  studying/focusing in the first place was never easy.

mostly thanks to him, i have horrible social/general anxiety (which i now am on SSRIs for), it makes me avoid conflict and addressing my issues early on. of course, that ended up working well. i can't believe i let this happen. i don't think i can take courses at a community college during this time since it's kind of late to apply. best i can do is work some minimum wage job until january. or try to appeal this decision, but i'm not sure if it's worth trying. 

school is the only thing keeping me afloat and attached to reality since i see people my age and whatnot. it makes me believe a future. now everything feels like it went dark.",18Sep2019,2
48,"This will serve as a sort of diary entry. But I'd still appreciate advice from you guys.

Today I failed my drivers license test for the third time. At this point I just feel nothing than shame. I  am ashamed of myself. I am an okay driver but it seems like I can't pull through this shit anymore. I just feel exhausted and like a pussy. The first two times failed because of dumb mistakes that I immediately recognized. But this time I thought to myself that I'm feeling okay and that this time will be the last time. But right at that moment I felt my legs trembling. Even though I told myself I was okay, my body said otherwise. I paid for this test myself this time and plan to repay my parents for the last two times. I simply feel guilty. My parents and my drivers license instructor are supportive and I still manage to let them down.

52,"I'll try make this as short as possible.

I'm 20 years old and unemployed/uneducated. I am/was a bad person and bad friend. A year or two ago I realised my flaws and saw myself for the first time.

I hate who I was. I have set goals and now have clear aspirations on how I can better myself and eventually hopefully, love myself.

I spend a lot of time worrying about other people, it's an awful habit because the worrying is doing nothing except distracting myself from my own problems.

I really want to give life a good shot, I want hobbies, I want a carrer, I just want to live life.

My problem is I don't see how I can do this while seeing family/friends. To make it very clear, my family and friends are not bad people at all. The problem is seeing them always involves alcohol/drugs. This is something I want to remove from my life. Most people say, still see your friends but remain sober. That's basically what I've failed to do for two years straight. I am too weak and self indulgent, I always end up using.

I feel like the only way for me to proceed and accomplish things is to focus entirely on myself for however long it takes. (Im guessing this could be 3-12 months)

I really feel this is the best option but also have constant nagging thoughts such as I'm selfish, I shouldn't do this, etc.

From on outside perspective, do I seem crazy? Am I thinking on the correct path?

Its ok if your apartment isn’t show home tidy or if you cant wash your clothes as well as your mum does. Yet. 

Its  ok if you have cereal for dinner for a week

Its ok if theres a pot on the sink

Its ok if havnt returned that thing or those letters or if the clothes you tried out actually aren’t that flattering 

Its ok if you have a 45 min shower and sleep with your makeup on

Its ok if you wanna walk around naked

Its ok if nothing makes sense and you dont feel human.

54,"So I’m depressed. And usually it’s at like a 5 but in the winter months it can be at like an 8 or a 9. I’m also in a two year relationship. And I can handle my depression just fine at a 5. I can be a normal person. I can get a lot of stuff done. And it’s only very rarely that I completely sink into it. But as the days get shorter and it gets colder, it gets worse. And every year, right before it gets worse, my survival brain kicks on. It knows there’s a threat, it knows we have to survive it, and to do so it wants me to fight it alone. So every year around this time, it wants me to burn every single bridge I have. And then the depressed part of my brain is like um no we need to make connections because we can’t do this alone. And then the survival part is like ya sure but were doing it my way first. So then it’s on repeat in my head, burn the ship down, jump out, survive. Ship. Burn. Jump. 

And that’s not even the worst bit. To reinforce that all bridges need to be burned in order to survive, the survival part of my brain will pick out little tiny details about him, details that I love, and say “you hate that now, every single negative emotion you have, fixate it on that one small insignificant thing.” And so I do. And then a couple weeks go by and I’m like, why do I hate that? What is so wrong about it that I hate it? And once I address it, I am free to not hate it again. But until I do, I hate it. Because my brain is just chanting, ship, burn, jump. Ship. Burn. Jump. 

And I know it’s getting bad again because I’ll be just driving on the highway and my brain does that thing where it tests you to make sure you’re alright. Love when you’re driving and its like, “What if you drove over the edge right now?” Or, “what if you just made a sudden U-turn?” And it’s just a way for your brain to test you. To make sure you’re okay. But lately its been “What if you break up with him out of nowhere? What if you just set fire to your entire relationship right now?”

And every time, I talk it down. Every time I try and reason with it. And he knows it’s not what I want to do. He knows I don’t want to fight. He knows I am trying my hardest. But all winter long I’m just haunted. Ship. Burn. Jump. Ship. Burn. Jump. Ship. Burn. Jump. Because at the end of the day, it’ll do whatever it has to to survive, whether I like it or not.",18Sep2019,2
55,"So I've run into a little issue as of late and it really is bothering me quite a bit.

About a week ago, I noticed that I couldn't really feel as deeply as before. Allow me to explain.

I used to be able to really feel emotions very deeply, whether it was sadness or happiness. The highs were really highs and the lows were also really low. I used to be able to listen to certain music and feel a wave of beautiful emotion just hit me and honestly I really loved that. I had been working a lot on myself lately, accepting myself for what I am, understanding myself and most importantly, learning to accept my emotions. 

Suddenly, one day I wake up and it feels like I can't really feel anything anymore. It feels like the emotions are still there, but instead of participating in them, I feel blocked from them. Its as if there's a glass barrier between me and my emotions, I know they're there, but I can't seem to access them and be a part of them. Things that used to make me happy don't really excite me anymore and I don't know why. 

I know a lot of people might say that I'm just ""growing up"" and getting more ""jaded"" or being able to control my emotions more but what my concern is is that this doesn't feel like a positive thing. I used to feel so happy just staring at a beautiful landscape and it would bring me such peace but now I can't seem to get that same feeling again and honestly, it kind of sucks. 

Anyone have any ideas on what this might be and what I can do to help it? Thanks.",18Sep2019,11

58,"Reigniting a love affair, tempting fate, playing with fire....

.... with nacho cheese. 

About 3 weeks ago while grocery shopping I ran across a large box of nacho cheese in two bags.  And yesterday while grocery shopping I decided to buy it. And so far I have had nachos for breakfast... two days in a row. I have soooooo missed nacho cheese since... the incident 

Years ago I got a LARGE can (talking about the large cans that restaurants get) of nacho cheese for free. ANd after opening it I was afraid of it going bad before I could finish it all. So I was putting it on all kinds of things like hot dogs, burritos and eating bowls of it with cantina style tortilla chips.  

Little did I know what was in store for me. How fucked up it would get. I got a SERIOUS bowel obstruction. Felt like a normal shit, but when I went to pass it.... I couldnt. At all. Did a lot of straining and pushing but it just wouldnt pass. I've passed large turds before, but apparently this was REALLY large. Suffice it to say I was pretty scared. I considered going to the ER. But looked up online what to do first. And what I read was that the ER was going to do something that I could do myself. 

So I figured It'd save me the embarrassment, time, trouble and a lot of money if I did it myself. So I donned several pairs of latex gloves ....and went ass-spelunking with my finger. Picking parts of the turd away. Luckily it was made up of a lot of little turds compressed together so they came out somewhat easily. Once I picked enough out and then tried to pass it again it worked and it came out with gusto. And I felt so relieved. You absoultely could not imagine how good it felt to be free from that monster. 

I looked at it in the bowl and it was basically the shape of a large microphone. Large at one end and smaller at the other. The large part was at my backdoor but couldnt get through. The smaller part was down the hallway a bit. The ball part (of the microphone) was concave a bit from what I had picked from it. And I guess the bowl-like shape compressed enough for me to pass it. It was probably about at least a foot long. 

Anyways... I am back at it again. Dancing with the nacho cheese devil. Hoping no bad shits come my way. Trying not to eat too much. Since it comes in two large bags and not a big open can... I think I can make the bag last so it doesnt spoil. I snipped a small opening on the corner of the bag to squeeze it out and put an office clip on it to not let air in (air makes things spoil quicker I think). 

Gonna have to resist eating it too often, but man I really do love nacho cheese. Especially after having abstained for so long. 

So... wish me luck.",18Sep2019,3

65,"Hi Reddit Folks,

I don't know where to put this. But I wanted to talk about it with someone. Or say something... I can't really talk to too many people about it because... Well... It's fucking dark. I've told my best friend, but I don't think I've told her all of it.  tl'dr at the end. 



Everything started to go well. My mental illness evened out due to some new medication. My troubled marriage started to go well; we even went on vacation together recently and it was great. The job that has been absolute agony is coming to a close, because I got my dream job and start next week. I'm a parent who loves their child but not being a parent, but now my kid is entering a phase where I do love them AND parenting. She says sweet things like ""I love my family"" every day at dinner. My husband just got a raise. 

Like seriously... I'm living in a god damn happy-fucking-movie. 

Don't get me wrong, nothing is perfect, but damn. 

It's like the beginning of lifetime move. In fact, once I described it that way... And I should have known... 

Back in March I had to take some time off of work because 1) I had a near psychotic episode and 2) I developed stomach problems. It's thought this was brought on by stress. (There was a reason I wanted a new job.) Once my brain was back on track (thank you medication!), I was left with moderate gnawing stomach pain relieved by eating carbs. Upper left quadrant. Time goes on, this does not improve. I'm put on omeprazole, but as the pain breaks through the does is increased. now I'm on a very large doses. It keeps the pain away mostly. But I can't go off of it or I'm in significant pain. Diagnosis: ulcer - unresponsive to treatment. 

Other symptoms come up... The pain spreads across my upper abdomen and is now also close to my naval. Two months ago (so 5 months into this mess...) I was referred for an endoscope, but I guess I wasn't a priority because it's coming up on Friday. TWO FUCKING MONTHS. And by me being pleasantly annoying and calling everyday, I got it moved up 2 weeks. 

So seven months into this beautiful journey of pain (last week), I present with mid back pain. Magically, I get an ultrasound, urinalysis, chest x-ray, blood work in 2 hours. I guess that back pain is a red flag. 

Monday I found out the results:

Pancreas - fine. Liver - fine. Gallbladder - gall stones. Right kidney - fine. Blood work - nothing exciting. Urinaysis - white blood cells. Left kidney - 2x2x2 cm mystery mass with blood flow. 

Fuck. 

It could be nothing. Might be a dromedary hump. Might be benign (except those white blood cells though, eh?). Gallstones could explain the pain in the upper right quadrant. My doctor is ordering a CT scan to shed some more light. 

It doesn't explain my stomach pain spreading other places. The other thing is that this pain has been changing. It's no longer the gnawing pain. It's now... I can't describe it. I'm no longer hungry. I can go a day without eating or noticing. Easy. I've lost 7 lbs. The pain used to get better with food, but no  longer does. I've shat blood in the past. 

So here I am. Friday is the big day with the endoscope and a colonoscopy. And I am having some serious freak outs. I've got a bad feeling. 

I've obviously spent some serious time going to Google Medical School in the last couple of months. 

My father in law died of kidney cancer. But at 2x2x2 cm without spreading, that's a likely good prognosis. Gastric cancer ... that does not have a very good outcome statistically. Two primary cancers are very unlikely. Metastasis of kidney cancer doesn't usually go to the stomach and vice versa. So unlikely to be stage 4 of either. (Hey I could be wrong, Google Medical School isn't real medical school... And if a doctor tells me something, I believe them, but no one has told me anything yet.) 

I'm not the healthiest or unhealthiest person. I'm 34 and very overweight. I don't drink, smoke, etc. I've been a bad vegan for the last 2 years (I flip from whole food plant based to junk food), and I'll sometimes be a vegetarian for convenience. I don't exercise. I live a relatively sedentary lifestyle, but I live in a big city, don't own a car and walk a lot. 10k steps is pretty easy to get on days where I'm not in an office.  

My mind is in just dark places these days. I can't concentrate. I've got some things to tidy up in my life before the new job, but I just can't seem to get the work done. I feel a sense of loss. I'm planning on what I'm going to do when the diagnosis comes in. I'm scared and cry regularly. 

It's plausible that this is a benign kidney thing and I've got some raging stomach problems that are non-cancerous. Sure. Plausible. But I'm not so sure that is likely anymore. If that's the case, this was my warning sign that I need to take care of myself. Hopefully, I didn't miss that sign ages ago with this as the result. 

My daughter is 4. I'm not afraid of death, but I am afraid of leaving her without a mother. I've got great life insurance and my spouse and daughter will be fine financially. 

tl;dr: Life was going great. Too great. Seven months of stomach troubles and many tests later a 2x2x2 cm mass was found in my kidney on Monday. My stomach troubles have morphed so now I'm afraid of gastric cancer. Endoscope and colonoscopy on Friday. I'm a 34 year old mom; I fear leaving my daughter without a mother. I'm a fucking mess.",18Sep2019,2

I try my best in school but constantly get unsatisfactory grades, I have a few friends, no ambition, no hobbies, no dreams. I know it seems like I'm spoiled and I should be grateful for everything I have, and I DEEPLY appreciate everything, but why do I feel so tired and empty?

Overall, I only feel this way if something triggers me, for example, getting bad grades, feeling guilty, dreading an upcoming event etc. Anyways if you have any advice for me then please do so, idk what to do I just kinda want to stop everything and disappear.",18Sep2019,5
67,"When I got married, my wife came with a dog she had just got and I instantly fell in love with her fun personality. She came with me on numerous backpacking and camping trips and generally hung out with me whenever I was home. She loves to bring you a dog toy when you get home and just wants to bury herself in your body as you pet her. I know it's kind of cliche to post to /self with fears and doubts but I just didn't know how else to get out all the fear and uncertainty in my heart. 

The last couple of days she has been pacing and anxious and her back legs are shaking. I'm hoping this is something we can fix. She's only 9 (lab mix). I'm sad at the thought of eventually having to say goodbye but more heartbroken over what her loss will do to my wife and kids and our other two dogs. They have been a close pack for nearly a decade now. I'm just lost and needed to vent. If you have a pet, go hug it, love on it and take as many mental pictures as you can.

68,"I'm 20F and from Europe (no Asian parents here). My decision doesn't put me in any kind of debt.
I'm first year med school and have really hard tought about my reasons for becoming a doctor. I have fallen into it by accident because I honestly haven't tought I'll get into one. I tought CS is in my future because it was my second choice and I enjoy it much more. But when I noticed that I have got in, I was in a dilema. Didn't know what to do and my environment kept pressuring me to accept because it is a safe job and has lots of money. So I accepted.
It was a big mistake. This was the worst year of my life. I was learning something I wasn't interested in and have started to hate it more and more. I had an epiphany in March: do I want to keep going like that? Just studying something I hate because my parents pressured me into it? I decided no. There are much faster and easier ways to succeed than 12 just learning, learning and learning while others enjoy life, get raises, start families etc. I know if I have kept going I would hate myself for not standing my ground and would probably have a mental breakdown or get seriously sick in the middle of my schooling. I have already got fat, have seriously harmed my physical health (I got gallstones) and my mental health. 
So I have told my parents, I'll take a year of absence to decide for myself. They have been calling me all kinds of bad names: that I'm stupid, they are questioning my intelligence, depression is for rich people (we are middle class), they don't want to have any business with losers and quitters, you want to go into CS, you are too old for that, programming is for losers and people will never hire someone like you, they'll rather hire someone cheap from India, you aren't smart enough for anything else besides medicine, nobody wants to hire someone who hasn't finished college in time, I have no chance of succeeding now, I'm acting like I'm 12, instead of 20, you aren't supposed to like your job etc. My father has disowned me and mother is under delusion I'll go back. They have also cut me off financialy. I'm lucky my grandparents are supportive because I got kicked out of the house.
I have a plan what I'll do and think it has a great chance of succeding. I won't tell what it is because I don't have enough time and it would take many more paragraphs to finish this post. The takeway is that it should make me happy AND be lucrative. Maybe I'll post an update a year from now. 
I expected lots of reactions and was prepared for all of them. Worst case scenario happened and I'm very hurt right now. I have started a few months ago squirreling my medication (for gallstones) away in the case they cut me off financialy. Dad basicaly said I can die now because I'm throwing my life away anyway. That now I can drink, do drugs and prostitute myself and if I get pregnant to deal with it myself. I'm still very much a virgin. 
Today is Wednesday and on Friday am moving out. For last few days I have been eating very little because of stress and not wanting to listen to my dad's vitriol (living room is very close to the kitchen). I have a few bottles of water in my room so I don't have to go to the kitchen.
I know I made the right decision for my physical and mental health, happiness and my potential future richness (I'm very ambitious and like to think I'm smart and resourceful). Even though I was prepared for that kind of reaction, I hoped I wouldn't need to do such drastic measures. I hope someday they realize how ridiculous and emotionaly abusive they acted. I'm not holding my breath, but if in the future they want any kind of relationship with me, they'll have to apologize.
If anyone is questioning my username it is very fitting. I'm a dominatrix at heart and think this is one of the main reason why I had strength to fight back so early on and not my last year of medschool or during residency etc. But I am still a human being and am in major emotional pain right now.",18Sep2019,2
69,"I've always been anti social or shy, I don't the reason behind it, but it makes me depressed in a way because I genuinely like people but I can't help the flood of thoughts that go through my head. A lot of the time I just never really have anything to say and I feel like that draws people off, but the thing is, they never say anything to me either, so I don't know if I'm the only one that can be blamed. Also I consider myself to be a genuine person, I like helping people just to help them and grow a bond with them, not because I'm looking for something in return, and I feel like this gives people the opportunity to disrespect me and walk all over me. If I spoke up about how I felt, I feel like people would be more apt to leave me alone. I dont even know what I'm feeling anymore, I have a sense that nobody really likes me for me but rather what I do for them and how I treat them and they take advantage of that. I'm a little slow and it takes me a bit to process things, so when people try explaining something to me and I dont get it, they start talking to me like I'm an idiot, probably has something to do with my childhood and my parents.

And, dead people have no memory neither have any way to use past experiences for something, because they are not. Dead peopel cannot think because they no longer ARE.

The most rational action is to commit suicide, you will prevent suffering and, since you die no matter what, there's no difference to live one second or one century.

But it's hard. You see the ground from a 2D perspective, no adrenaline, but the step to fly 100 meters into the abyss is hard to make. Hard as fuck. For whatever reason, you need to be brave to face the unknown.

There may be another way: going to war with existence, becoming a terrorist and destroy the universe, bring mayhem and pain so others can kill you. Not sure about this since it seems far harder than suicide by your hand.

Who am I? Why do I exist? What the hell is this reality? There is chaos in my mind, I don't understand how can days past one after the other in an endless reverberation.

This time I was waiting outside in the cold for the Uber to arrive and he ended up taking a detour and stopped for a minute, not sure why, it annoyed me at first but didn't delay it too long so it was fine once I was in the car. 

Then on my way back (I was shopping) I ordered an Uber again and got the same driver. I was waiting outside in the cold again and this time he just took a detour and then stopped.. I waited for at least 10-15 minutes for him to move from that odd location and then start driving towards me. I was furious and annoyed and was sure I was going to give him 1 star. But as soon as I had warmed up a bit in the car I just couldn't go through with it. It was an older Indian man who didn't speak the language perfectly and all I could think about was that he probably had a family to take care of and he relied on this income. 

So I ended up giving him 5 stars again and even a tip this time.. Because I felt bad I almost jeopardized a mans livelyhood and probably the people who depend on him.

79,"My dad passed away back in 2015 from a lung infection(he was a heavy smoker).In the weeks leading up to his death,he was always coughing violently.He would always shout my name from the bedroom whenever he would have a coughing fit and i would rush in and help him sit up and hold his shoulders while he was coughing and spitting into a pail.As a 13 year old kid,that was really traumatising as i didnt really have any control over the situation other than watching my father get one cough closer to death.

Fast forward to today,4 years after his death.I was using my computer.This was around 11 pm.When all of a sudden,I hear my name being called in a way similar to how my dad would say it when he was in distress.When i rushed to the bedroom,my mom(who i admit can be somewhat narcissistic sometimes),shouted at me for always being on the computer(this is one of the many reasons why i dread spending time with my mom).I was on my computer writing an important email to my college professor.

Im usually a calm person and can hold my composure,but for some reason i just snapped.I was calm at first,i told her to never do that ever again,i was so worried that something happened to her,she cut me off and went off about me always being on the damn computer,she then went on a tangent about how ""it's sleeping time""(who the fuck says that to a 18 year old?).Anyway,i just start tearing up and reminiscing about the times my dad would always look at me when he had those coughing fits,and how i could tell that something bad was gonna happen.She ignored me crying and blamed it on the computer(surprise).

I start crying even more,i shouted at her and said ""PLEASE DONT DO THAT AGAIN,DAD USED TO DO THAT BEFORE HE DIED,I THOUGHT SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED TO YOU"".All she said was,""next time just off the computer,it's sleeping time already"".I just lost it,I tell her how she always finds something about me to complain about,when i lost weight after my dad died,she would call me a skeleton,when i gained some weight the year after,she called me a pig.I just was not having it.This went on for a solid 2 minutes.My mom then realised that she was in the wrong and hesitantly gave me a hug.She did this while reiterating that there are rules and i had to follow them.Yet again she had to establish authority.
I was exhausted and didnt bother talking back.

I've never really talked to anyone about my dad's passing before.This breakdown was just an accumulation of all the pent up feelings i've had.Idk where to go from here.Sorry for the long read.",18Sep2019,11
80," 

I need a place to vent this. I’m hoping that anyone can offer some insight and maybe advice on how to handle a situation. It is really long and I’m so sorry. I appreciate anyone who sticks it out until the end!

I (26F) became friends with a coworker (41F) who I’ll call Jane. We bonded very quickly, she called me her BFF almost immediately, and deep down the entire time, I knew something was unhealthy. Jane had a bad breakup over a year and a half ago. It is still all she ever talks about. It was easy to see that she was trying to fill that void with me, and I went along with it because I desperately wanted a close friend. She is a therapist and older than me. I have a massive insecurity that I am in the wrong in many situations. I think she saw that and took advantage of it. I think what I am mostly hoping for from this post is I want to make sure I’m not overreacting and want to be as honest from both sides as possible. I also could use some advice on what to do the next time I see her, which is tonight.

The red flags were plentiful. First, I felt like I couldn’t say no if she wanted to hang out. Jane keeps asking until she gets her way. I mean, will ask 20+ times if I keep telling her no. If I said I had plans or was with my boyfriend, she would get short with me. One time she asked me to go to a store with her in the middle of the work day and I said I had too much to do. Once I said I couldn’t go, she started texting me and telling me that she went to the store on her own and sat there crying because the last time she was there she was with her ex. It felt very manipulative.

We live in different cities but work at the same place. The second red flag was when one day, Jane brought up that she had to work late that weekend and didn’t want to drive an hour back home afterwards, so she asked if she could stay with me. I said sure. It was a weekend, so we had planned on watching tv all day before she had to go to her nighttime event. However, things came up so I asked if she could come later in the afternoon. I am currently getting my master’s degree and became incredibly overwhelmed with school work. I was also feeling cramped because my house was a mess and I just felt like everything was piling up. I told her all of this and she said that was ok and that she would come over. My SO surprised me by coming over to help clean while I did my school work, which was so sweet and I appreciated it. He also lives an hour away, so when he comes up for any reason, he usually stays the night. So once I had finished all of my work, around 2pm, I texted her immediately. I told her I was done, but also warned her that my SO had come to help and would probably be around. She said she didn’t want to come anymore and was short with me. I don’t know if I’m an asshole for this or not. I felt bad, so I encouraged her to still come. She ignored me until about 7:30pm, when she texted to say that her event was over and she’d come spend the night anyway. I was annoyed, but I said ok.

The day after this, she told me that she likes my SO, but she doesn’t want to be around us together (out of the dozens of times we’ve been together, he’s been around for maybe 2 hours of all of it). I was annoyed because of that detail, but I said I understand her not wanting to be third wheel. Two days later, she called me and asked what I was doing. I told her I was walking into a brewery with my SO and could call her later. She then got pissy and said, “well I guess I wasn’t invited.” Every time I told her I had to go, she would say “ok, but wait,” and rattle on for 5 more minutes. This went on for 15 minutes.

I won’t lie, I am a judgmental person. It is something I am trying to work on. I don’t expect people to be perfect. But I do wish more people were self-aware. I complained to Jane about this. A LOT. Every day was a new story about my boss, or my sister. This is another thing I am paranoid about. If I have so many mentally unstable people in my life, I must be the common denominator, right? Maybe I’m not as logical as I hope. I told her this numerous times. Each time she told me I wasn’t the crazy one, which I appreciated. I should also note, just to my own credit, that the people whose opinions I value most (my SO’s, my two best friends, my mom) would also told me this. So not EVERYONE in my life is crazy. However, it does feel like there is a large amount of craziness I have to deal with on a day-to-day basis. I will also say, the judgments she hears from me are all about people I do not like, and she knows I don’t like them. I am never complaining about my SO, my friends, any of the workplace friends we both get along with. In fact, I know I can bitch about people too much, so I try to counteract that with singing the praises of those I love. I know that doesn’t make up for my negativity, like I said, I am working on it. And it is also not a black and white area of those I complain about. There is plenty of gray inbetween!

This is important to note because she started yelling at me to “stop judging her” at random times. I mean, we would be sitting at a table talking, or both on our phones, and all of a sudden she would yell “stop judging me!” I would insist that I wasn’t and expressed my confusion, and all she would ever say is “you looked me up and down when you first got here! That’s judging me!” I would tell her I wasn’t even aware that I did, that I was probably just admiring her clothes (which I compliment her on all the time) and to not assume I’m judging her. So, red flag #3.

Everything exploded about two weeks ago. I realized that Jane hurts my feelings a lot and I’m always too afraid to tell her because I’m scared she’ll get mad at me (I mean, major red flag! And I knew it, but I still didn’t do anything about it!). Jane was being super aggressive towards a coworker. Jane is the type of person who loves to tease people and give people shit, however the moment you do it back, she starts pouting or crying. The coworker kept saying “Jane hates me,” “Jane likes me the least,” “why do I feel like an adopted child in this group.” Later, I pulled Jane aside and told her this. I never once said she was harsh or cruel, I simply said, “Coworker seems sensitive to your teasing, maybe you could take it easy on her?” Well, Jane got mad. The next day, she bragged about how she called the coworker, how the coworker said I didn’t understand their relationship and that I should butt out. Jane went on to tell me how hurt she was by me, and that I should know her well enough to know she would never hurt someone’s feelings. That I was rude and judging her because I thought she would purposely hurt the coworkers feelings. I kept my cool, but I was pissed. And I told her I was pissed. I said I was sorry for hurting her feelings,  that my comment was not a reflection on her, that I was only looking out for the coworker and her feelings, and now that I was being villianized by both. I admitted I don’t know their relationship, because they work together and I’m not around to see it 24/7, but if someone is complaining about their feelings being hurt, I would take it seriously. She then told me that my story about the coworker was just hearsay, and that she would only believe what the coworker told her.

So I told her that hurt my feelings. That I don’t feel trusted or like I’m out to sabotage them. Without a sorry or explanation, she went off on me telling me how judgmental of a person I am. How she has to be careful about everything she says and does around me because she knows she’ll be judged by me. I became the one apologizing. I said I’m sorry she felt that way, that I don’t want her to feel that way about me, but I don’t know what to do. I once again said (for at least the 10th time) that I’m not judging her, and I have no other way to prove that except for my word. Jane responded, “you judge everyone else, why would you not judge me?” which is an absolutely fair point. I told her it was fair, but that she has never heard me judge those I love, and she was in that category. She then told me how I was just a judgmental person who wouldn’t change, so she’d have to accept that.

She told me I never encourage her. I never compliment her. This is where I stopped catering to her feelings. I wasn’t harsh, but I told her that wasn’t true and that she knows it. I told her I am always complimenting her shoes, her clothes, her earrings. I am always telling her she looks good in the selfies she takes (because she shoves them in my face and always says, “I’m so fat” or “I’m so ugly). And she told me that wasn’t enough. She told me complimenting her clothes isn’t as good as saying “you look nice today.” That saying “that is a cute photo” isn’t the same as saying “you’re cute in real life.” This is the most absurd thing of all to me. I cannot, under any circumstances, think of any reason that I would tell any friend “you don’t compliment me enough/the way I want to be complimented.”

Ever since then, I have been very short with her when she texts me. I have avoided seeing her. I know I should tell her I’m not interested in hanging out in person, but this woman gives me so much anxiety. And I know whatever I say, I’ll be made the bad guy. She’s finally gotten the hint that I don’t want to be friends anymore. She has made that clear in multiple texts that have just been about work. The problem is, far before this fight, she was scheduled to come present to coworkers in my department which I organized. That presentation is tonight, and I know that once it is over, she will corner me. She’ll probably insist on going to my house, but I’m not going to let that happen.

I don’t know what to say to her. I don’t know if I go into the reasons why this isn’t working, or if I just keep it short. I am constantly questioning if I’m in the wrong for going cold on her. Or how to best express myself so that she can’t twist things around on me. I’m just so anxious and scared for tonight, I don’t want to deal with this anymore.",18Sep2019,2
83,"I had an interesting conversation with a friend today about how I describe myself to others and it was very eye-opening.

As a person who has lived life as a bit of a doormat through friendships and relationships, it's interesting to dig deeper into how I view myself, and how I present myself socially.

Whether its an interview, a date, a social gathering with a stranger, I tend to say things about myself that would be ""of service"" to others. Things like, ""I'm empathetic, I strive to be a good friend or partner, I follow through on promises, etc."" However, I'm learning to say things about myself like, ""I'm creative, I'm passionate about many things, I enjoy deep conversations and connections.""

Anyone else have this habit?

I mean, it's not a terrible thing. But I wonder if simply changing how you describe yourself to others changes the level of confidence you may be putting out there. Talking about myself too much, or in a way that seems a little ""braggy"" feels icky to me. So I'm working on a happy medium.",18Sep2019,3

It’s like no one fully understand this type of anxiety. The “throwing up anxiety.” Because that’s what it is. A deep anxiety for throwing up. It’s the worst thing in the world to me and because of you I can’t really live life to the fullest. 

I could probably write a whole book about all the things I have to do to avoid you. All the things I can’t do because of you. Everything I can’t eat because of you. And when I come to think about it, maybe I triggered you to show up tonight. Because I finally got the courage to start writing on my blog and some of my childhood experiences, that probably brought you into my life in the first place, was mentioned. So maybe I did this to myself today. But I have some news for you! You can try your best to break me but I know I’m stronger than that. I may never get rid of you but I sure as hell will find a way to handle you so you have less of an impact on my life. Screw you anxiety!!",18Sep2019,1
105,"So I'm in my first week of uni. I'm so far enjoying it but I've been having trouble socializing with my flatmates, I just don't know what to talk about.

I did come.here with some friends which I though would make it easier. The first two days we hanged out together and had a good time.  

However, after buying a pretty expensive band for  free entry to night events throughout the week, I haven't been able to be much with them (buying things, registration, banks, visiting the area...) but I did contact them to hang out for the night parties. They told me that they.were going with their flatmates which was understandable but because I'm very shy I didn't join in and stayed in my flat. The second night they didn't want to hang out cause they were tired, I didn't have time to socialize with my flatmates so I couldn't go with them either. 

Now we are in the third night and they have told me they are going with another group in the same building without even telling me that they were going to go to their pre-party after telling them in the morning that I really wanted to hang out this night.

I'm angry and frustrated because I spent money on this band and I still haven't been able to use it. I'm also quite sad as I'm now realizing that soon I will have close to no friends. What shall I do?",18Sep2019,1

109,"My mom has always been the person I admired most and ran to for advice.
The past few years, I feel like she changed for the worse.

I've suffered from social anxiety since I can remember myself, but only realized what it was  3 years ago, during therapy sessions I hid from her.
My entire life, whenever I had an attack, she would tell me to stop being dramatic and brushed it off. Somehow I never took it too harshly and just learned I have to save my tears for when no one's around.
When I was done with therapy, I don't remember why but we had a fight, and I told her I've been going to sessions, she went silent and I thought that's that, maybe now she'll be more sensitive.
But as time passed by she began getting upset about every little thing, yelling whenever I had an opinion about something.

She loves helping others even if it hurts her own family. I tried to confront her about it and she blamed me for attacking her and never supporting what she does, then brought up some examples that aren't even true.
I always support her hobbies, I do graphic design for her on demand, even skip work days to travel half the country to visit and help her. But when I refuse to do it once, she flips and tries to guilt trip me.
I really hate how I've grown feeling I must do everything my parents ask me to, as they raised me, and I feel guilty when I don't want or can't help.

She lives with my dad and little brother and whenever I visit it seems like all they do is fight.
I tried confronting her but she gets even more upset and says she doesn't wanna talk about it. She never does.
It has become unbearable for me to visit them, especially as my words have no impact on anyone.

I want to add my mom is still a great person. She helps me as well, but feels comfortable to decline sometimes and that's fine by me.
It's just that talking to her about sensitive matters is impossible, and that frustrates me. I feel like we're not as close as we used to be.",18Sep2019,1

113,"Facebook has already banned them. If you do a simple Google search on this far right rag, you’ll see how sketch it is. Just yet another pro-Trump medium that’s trying to legitimize itself by advertising itself at every click. I don’t like promoting the banning of media outlets, but I can’t say I’d be sad if YouTube followed in Facebook’s footsteps.",18Sep2019,1
