1,"Now it seems like every year I look back and think ""that was hell, I hope next year that things will start working out again"" ... and I can't remember when last I didn't feel that way come this time. I dream of rock bottom - a fictional sanctuary where loss cannot enter and the only direction is up - but lower and less are always with you, and always hungry.

It didn't really start with anything, or if it did, nothing I can point to. I came from a split home with both parents remarried into new families with a new kid each, but I always managed and rarely felt like an outsider. I got really lucky with a job when I moved to the mountains, and I started making more than I ever had while spending far less. The job was hard and my boss insufferable, but giving every family member a big-ticket gift for Christmas that first year felt incredible. I struggled with my girlfriend who struggled with her own mental health, but I soon found myself more in love than I thought possible. Every day was constant activity that I seemed only just able to cling to, but I felt that I had gathered so much good in my life, and the pride of my family was palpable.

Then things turned. Living on a mountain has consequences, and my circle of friends dwindled down to my roommate and my SO. That first year I was just too busy and didn't make time to take advantage of my financial freedom. A lot of my old friends were girls which made my SO uncomfortable when we started dating, so those friendships fell apart when I stopped interacting with them. Without good outlets, my SO and I started to fight a lot. These fights spilled into work when I would get a text that led to a call that led to hurt feelings all day. I lost my patience with my boss one day and resigned, confident I could find someplace I would be treated better. [To be fair, this place and this person have a reputation on the mountain, turnover was Extremely High, and they have been investigated multiple times (they're very rich &amp; very powerful so it always goes away)]

The new job never materialized and unemployment has limits, so after putting off my dad's urging for months, I took him up on an offer to work for him at less pay and less hours with a daily commute off the mountain. It was a big mistake. I made less than UI after expenses and the strain made our relationship tense. My dad and I have always struggled to communicate because he is assertive with his judgements, which makes him impatient. He has also always been one of those conservatives who says ""I'm a centrist"" despite only listening to Rush Limbaugh and neo-lib YouTubers. One day he finally snapped, and years of resentment with my mom for being my main guardian and - in his mind - raising me to be weak and stupid, came spewing out of him. He said I was ""everything wrong with America"", ""a disappointment to the whole (his) family"", and that no one wanted to talk to me anymore because I was a radical sheep for listening to NPR. I left and spent my lunch crying on the phone to my mom, trying to figure out what happened. When I got back to work, I was asked to sign disciplinary papers my dad had written about the ""incident"" which I refused because it was full of lies. I was fired and the paperwork submitted to the state so I could not apply for UI again. I haven't talked to my dad - and consequently, his entire family - in almost 2 years now. They believed him more, and in any case, I'm not the only of his kids he doesn't have a relationship with so what is it to them?

This is when I found myself falling without a parachute. The cost of living on the mountain was always cheep but I sure found ways to buckle down. In spite of this, I wiped out my savings and managed to pile up what is as of this writting almost $9,000 in high-interest debt. With nothing else to turn to, I got an offer to come back to the first employer. Turns out they lost their biggest asset when the other partners forced them out for delaying (and milking) the financial backers. All of their employees who weren't laid off, left shortly after as pay and benefits were cut in secret. I was the only person desperate enough to stay with them as they repurposed their other assets. It's been a year since I went back to work for them and somehow my debt has actually gotten larger because of interest and continued behind-the-scenes cuts. I lost medical and dental last year, and next year I won't get holiday or vacation pay.

The stress has made me physically ill, with many nights being unable to sleep through anxious dreams that wake me covered in cold sweat. So many mornings I wake up wishing I had died in my sleep and how the hell is anyone supposed to function at 100% when they start their day like that? Without health insurance I've had to stop all my medications which have their own withdrawals too. Everything about my body feels like a burden.

Truly the hardest loss was my SO. Our fighting never got better and we split up a few times, even seeing other people in between. I kept coming back to this belief that any world without her was not the right world, and I wanted so badly to have a normal and healthy relationship. In spite of every challenge I faced, I wanted to move forward with the one thing I felt sure about, but she was never sure. She only wanted to do her own thing, she was wildly inconsistent, and totally unavailable. It got so common for her to make plans to see me and then stand me up without so much as a text or anything, that I still struggle to believe anybody when they set a date. Silence now scares the hell out of me, because she would use it like a weapon and without warning to punish me whenever she felt like it. Then one day she goes with her dad out to see family in Arkansas, and upon coming back, announces that the two of them are moving there in a month. No warning whatsoever, and utterly at odds with every reason she had ever given me for not wanting to take the relationship further.

I was incredibly hurt, but I tried to be supportive. I practically twisted her arm to make her go with me to a lavender festival, something I knew she loved, just so I could have one last happy memory with her. I got us both baby plants and we painted pots for them, and I wrote on mine ""may this lavender grow as strong as my love for you"" because I hoped at least it might last. I told her I was sad, but that I loved her more than I was sad, so I only wanted her to be where she felt she needed to be. The day of the move I didn't hear from her, and for some time after. She wouldn't respond, just like she had done so many times. Then maybe a week or two later I get a call, and she's chatting with me like nothing happened and telling me about her new job and how beautiful it is. She tells me I should move there too so she has a friend. I say ""I can't leave my family"" but I'm thinking ""Why, so I can entertain you until you find friends?"" 

I was bitter. The jokes on me though, because that's exactly what happened anyway. She would call me on her way to work or home, but never made time for it and never answered or returned any of my calls. Then one day she stopped altogether. It's been a few months now since I've heard anything, and she and all her friends have blocked me everywhere like I was the problem. But I don't know, maybe I was. Why else would all this bad stuff keep happening? Something must be wrong with me.

...

My roommate has gone to work tonight (he does lights at a club in the city) so I'm here alone. I want to reach out but I have nobody to reach out to. I had a hookup recently that went well enough, and I tried to make new plans with her, but someone else got to her first so that feels kinda bad. Today should just be any other day but it isn't. It's a time to reflect, to look back and measure progress, but all I can imagine is new ways for things to go wrong in the next few months, the next few years...

I'm going to try and clean around the house. I hope somehow it translates into cleaning up my life but I'm truly at a loss. The proverbial Tomorrow only scares the shit out of me.",01Jan2019,1
2,"Hello, my name is Daniel. I'm a Canadian. I just completed my Master of Arts in media production. I produce, direct, and edit videos. I want to be at the forefront of technology and innovation, but I feel lost. 

Here is my directing and editing demo reel if you're interested in checking it out: https://vimeo.com/292544218

I want to look back on my life when I'm on my deathbed and be able to say, I contributed creatively in some way to that revolutionary company or technology. I graduated about four months ago from the MA program and have been looking tirelessly for creative work in Canada in any company as a social media specialist, videographer, and editor. I must have applied to over 500 jobs with custom cover letters. I believe I have a strong CV. I've done odd jobs for Red Bull, Tim Hortons, and some major YouTube channels, but the creative side of the media industry seems so competitive that all is starting to feel hopeless to me. 

My girlfriend of 2.5 years left me about a week ago because she didn't see a future in my career path, but I want to continue on. I want to prove her wrong, I have a future I want to believe in despite all of the hurdles I am currently facing. I currently have a few freelance jobs here and there, but they have just barely been covering my food and rent, and I searched and applied tirelessly just to get those gigs. I am so desperate to show the world how great I can be as a media production professional. I have reached out to all of my friends for positions within my field in addition to positions that my now ex-girlfriend tried to get me into, such as sales, and marketing, but I am struggling to find work or happiness. I want to tell stories that resonate with and inspire people. I want to inspire the next greatest technological trends. I have such a fiery passion to grow and be great and I am so scared of wilting away. I will push to be the greatest I can be for as long as I'm breathing. I can only hope it will be enough.

In the next measured Gregorian calendar year I'm going to be subjected to (20≤) unsought &amp; lambasted/embarrassed sensations (each iteration of which I will overreact to in innumerable ways, including: demanding un-&amp; over-qualified professors of lessons in life to exalt my ability to perceive @ their own, non-spared expenses &amp; time), experience un-shareable painshurtuffering, &amp; really fine doubt what these near d""eat""h experiences are all about before, non-enthusiastically giving up the need to reiterate such conversation ceasers as: ""You've been too consistently fervent in your attempts to express the charactegor the conscious portions of your brain have allowed to become your existence's filter too early &amp; those surrounding you subjected you to mean conditioning meant to make you indistinguishable from a peer in the 35th to 65th percentile. I really don't relish telling you what I learned the hard way but, we're both incredibly overvalued when we're believing ourselves to be perceived by those truly below (italics)average(/italic)s (wwwww&amp;h are the measurements being dawn-e?) as average.

Ok so i had a friend in college like 4 years ago (he started working and i went for studies instead). We never talked again until this summer where we met up and talked with other old classmates) nothing after that. I took advantage of the New years Eve to send him a message and try to start talking with him again, that worked, but i really dont know how to re engage conversation since i dont know if he has new friends now and is interested in meeting again.

10,"1. Literally every person that reached adulthood years has had to face mortality and other existential concerns. And a lot of them made it to pretty old ages decently enough despite it, so there has to be some hope for me, too.


2. People change to some degree whether they want to or not. I will not always be this way.


3. I am the cause for a lot, if not all, of my suffering. And that fact can and should be be empowering rather than another reason to hate myself.


4. I don't need to have passions or lifelong goals or dreams. There is nothing wrong with the continuous pursuit of short-term goals.


5. I have more control over my mind and well-being than I tend to think I do.


6. Failing does not have to mean that I am a failure.


7. I am underdeveloped in a lot of commonplace social and communications skills. But so is a lot of people. And if I can continue to learn stuff in academia, I can also learn and practice how to socially function more normally.


8. I can be closer to the supportive, content, mature individual that I want to be.


9. I don't need to be always happy and I don't need to be always depressed.


10. I'm like a store-brand apple pie. I could definitely do with some improvements and ice cream, but I am pretty alright as is, too. ",01Jan2019,1

12,"Well hi there everyone, happy new year and that all!
As well as happy birthday to me, yay! However I feel completely underwhelmed by the whole experience, it's cold wet and miserable weather wise, rather shitty after a hot and summy South-African Cristmas. And now catching a cold, with a GF passed out sick. 

All in all, no it wasn't a TERRIBLE night, but it was definitely not the 18th birthday I expected. However this isn't technically my birthday yet, as I'll probably celebrate tomorrow daytime with mum and bae, still. I wish I'd have more friends to have surrounded myself for this rather special day.  Though it's difficult to maintain and friendships and have invitable people when almost no one add effort back to whatever friendship it is. It is also my first Christmas and birthday where I didn't have my dad around, which hit me harder than I had expected

But enough negativity for the new year, fun story for today was that I accidentally baked my extra-special space biscuits instead of my Super-delishous  choc-chips!(Admittedly they look exactly the same in the freezer, lol for bad labeling practices) And so got myself, bae and I even think my mum to some degree accidentally stoned. XD

And I DO feel positive for this upcoming year, I've got a feeling it'll be particularly prosperous, however the start could've been a bit more with a bang. 

Hope the rest if you had a more Bangful NYE

Happy new year

14,"I think to put my point across here I've got to at least try and be objective; but that requires being honest about your own biases too. And a big one for me is that I don't like myself.

That statement has honestly rung true for the majority of my life- and it's probably made it a bit difficult to make out the wood for the trees at this point. 

But it's the New Year- and I decided to be alone despite several offers from people to keep me company. And I need to believe there's a reason for that otherwise I truly am fucked at this point. And going into 2020 not being any better is terrifying to me so hopefully that'll provide sufficient motivation for me to finally turn a corner.

So first I need to be honest about what I don't like about myself- because I just need to write it down at this point.

I can't connect with people. Any relationships I've had with others have been strained to say the least- for as long as I can remember. At primary school I did get bullied a lot but I believe a lot of that was due to my own lack of self awareness as a kid. But pretty much all friendships I've ever managed to strike up have been more from circumstance than an actual bond I've been able to form with someone- and all of them have eventually fallen prey to my own inability to stay in touch with anyone or progress a relationship. And now I'm at a stage where even when people are nice to me I either second guess it or just believe it comes from pity.

And I guess that comes from the fact that I think I'm a freak. And I try not to say that in a judgemental sense- more just in the way that I think I'm an outlier, or faulty. Coming out this year, while definitely being positive in the self acceptance vein really hasn't helped in making me feel less like this around others. Christmas especially hurt because I couldn't get it out of my head for one second that I was this burden that people felt obligated to try and be accepting of- when in actual fact that would all have been enjoying themselves a lot more if I was never even there. 

And I guess that's the crux of it. I don't feel like I deserve help, or kindness, or love. So even when people attempt to give any of those to me, I'll do my best to sabotage that and I can't stop myself from doing that. The last ten years of my life have basically completely fallen victim to this and I really don't know how to change. I wish I could. But I really don't know how. Every fuck up I make just feeds back into that shit image of myself I have and makes me spiral even deeper.

I want to go to drama school.

I want to resurrect some of the friendships I've fucked up. 

I want to be able to help my family with their problems instead of just making them worse.

I want to be fit.

But honestly all of these things right now just feel like I'm wishing that I was somebody else. Because while somebody else may not fuck some of that up, I will. And knowing that is such an awful feeling.",01Jan2019,1

17,"So my ex from a few years ago and I are (or were) still friends. Our relationship was toxic and both of us caused issues at some point. Hers were rooted in her insane insecurities and self depreciation which couldn’t be fixed by any amount of my love. Mine were from losing patience with her depression and anxieties among other things. We argued a lot, often about the same things over and over on/ off sometimes. We were long distance too so that didn’t help. 

Things were reaching a boiling point and I was trying to push her away, I couldn’t take it anymore and had been distancing myself and telling her she needs to move on for her own sake and mine, but she loved me too much and couldn’t cope without me, she’d cry and one time even cut herself because I blocked her number for 15 minutes and she thought I’d never come back. She was accusing of female friends, sometimes suicidal. I just got colder and colder towards her and she just got sadder and sadder. 

The last argument we ever had was on the phone and I said it was time. She was crying, a bawling wreck. I don’t know why, but I recorded it, just 14 seconds of her heartbreak. She said “please don’t do this I’m not ready”, I harshly replied “when will you ever be ready?”, she begged me. “Please. Don’t do that.. I don’t want to lose my best friend”, before breaking down into tears again and the recording ends. No one ever heard it, I don’t know why I felt the need to do it. It was if I needed evidence of what I had to listen to any time I tried to escape the toxicity for both our sakes and why it was so difficult when I had to listen to her break down like that every time. 

A couple years on, we’re still friends but speak irregularly, new relationships, new phones. All my data is transferred over, I decide to go through the old stuff I’d never bothered looking through before but knew it was there because I’m a phone album hoarder. The clip is still there. I listen to it and my heart shatters and I can’t help by cry. I can’t stand hearing my once best friend sound so broken and scared, even thinking about it now and writing her words put a hole in my chest. I’m not the same person I was when I did that, I would never even think to do it now and I know it was shitty of me to record someone when they’re so vulnerable and don’t know, but I never used it against her. In my moment of remorse and guilt, I decided to send her a message. I apologise for everything that went wrong in our relationship and all the ways I behaved (without taking full responsibility) and ask if we can properly rekindle our friendship because I do so miss her dearly as my friend. But I also include that finding this recording is what sparked my message and that I’d understand if it made her mad, and I now regret having done so. 

She ignores everything I say about apologising and feeling so much guilt and how it broke my heart to hear her that way all over again and wanting to become good friends again. She asks  straight away about the recording which is understandable and that’s all she can focus on, she’s raging mad that I did it and kept it a secret for years and that I still have it (unintentionally), and tells me never to talk to her. It’s been over a month and I message her one more time to say she doesn’t need to reply but if she ever changes her mind or if she needs someone to talk to, I’m sure she has other people she’d talk to before she ever considered me, but if she needed it I’d be there. I know what she looks and sounds like when she’s in pain and I hate to think about her like that again, I just want to be there for her and to know that she’s okay. I don’t know if it’s because she’s my first love that I have a soft spot for her and making sure she’s okay but I do. 

A week later she messages me and tells me that she told two of her friends a very intimate secret of mine that I told her in confidence and didn’t want anyone else to know, and that they’ve known for years. A spiteful message in an attempt to hurt me the way I hurt her, and I’m conflicted because I feel like I deserve it but also that she essentially did the same thing as me and potentially worse, and also kept it hidden for years. She’s stopped talking to her previous best friend who is a mutual friend of ours because she hasn’t stopped talking to me when she knows what I did years ago, and is now just pushing us both further and further away, calling us names and still being so angry at us both after more than a month. If that’s what she wants then fine, but my heart still wretches when I think about that audio and I still want to know she’s okay. 

Do I deserve to never be forgiven or is she being unreasonable? ",01Jan2019,1
18,"Today is New Years Eve.  A year ago, I was with my boyfriend at his best friend’s apartment. We all went to a local bar and ran into a bunch of my old friends from undergrad. I spent the night bonding with my boyfriend’s best friends, catching up with my own friends, and dancing in my boyfriend’s arms. I was surrounded by people I loved and I felt loved. It was one of the best New Years I’ve ever had. 

Welp, 2 weeks ago, my boyfriend and I broke up after a 4 (ish) year relationship, so clearly we’re not spending New Years together anymore. I was invited to a friends party and was considering attending, but she canceled it a few days ago.  My best friends all live 2+ hours away from me and have plans with their own significant others. 

I went to my parents house because I didn’t want to be alone. We spent some time together earlier, but they fell asleep early around 8:30 PM and went to bed. My brother is out partying with his own friends and enjoying life. I’m truly happy for him, but also a little jealous. 

So here I am, sitting alone in my parents living room, trying to find something to pass the time. I’m not mad or angry and I recognize that I am responsible for creating my own happiness. But I do feel pretty empty right now. I’m 23 years old, I’m in good health, I’m young, still attractive, and in my prime. Yet here I am, alone on New Year’s Eve. 

I’m not sure what the point of my post is. Maybe to feel heard? 2018 had a pretty shitty end through a bunch of personal issues going on in my life and breaking up with my boyfriend. I guess it just feels nice to connect with others sometimes. Things have a weird way of changing. ",01Jan2019,1
20,"I just want to write and get stuff off my chest. I'm sorry if it's long. Warning: Long.

The last 2 years have been crazy. I left my narcissistic ex in early 2017 - he wasn't a bad guy, but I figured out he cared less about me and more about what I/others could do for him. It was like a slap in the face. But I met this guy who I honestly believe is the love of my life, shortly after we split up - it was so soon, and I had to get over some of my trust issues, but he's just this amazing guy. He's just gorgeous. He's sweet and selfless. He wants to work through all our problems and grow old together.  

And he asked me to move in with him and his 3 teenage kids earlier this year. He trusted me enough to do that. He has a civil servant job and doesn't make a lot of money, and I try to pitch in financially and with any housework that I can. I bought some nice gifts for the kids this Christmas, paid for with my credit card because I thought, hey, I'll make up the money in less than 2 weeks once I go back to work. The gifts weren't stupid extravagant things, but nice things like bedspreads that they can take to college, which they loved. They're still a little uncomfortable around me, but they're good kids, and we're making progress in getting to know each other. 


For the past few years, I'd been in this super toxic job. It was in the behavioral health field where most of the managers were just nasty crazy people. Not all, but the ones I had to deal with were. I got my PhD and the people at this place were like ""Nope, we're not going to honor our agreement to renegotiate your salary. You think you're pretty smart, and you kind of are, but we'll tell you how to do your job."" Infuriating, demeaning stuff like that, where if you fight back it just makes you look like a trouble-maker (and several people who did fight back got fired in some of the most messed up ways). I'm serious, these people were mean, racist, narcissistic, just... ugh. 

So two months ago, I was finally offered a contract position at a large financial institution. Contract work is risky, but oh my god I didn't have to put up with abuse anymore. I jumped on it. I spent the next two months bored out of my mind with constantly changing project objectives and supervisors who didn't seem to know exactly what they were talking about, but I was so happy not to have to deal with passive aggressive put-downs or my whiny, demanding, micromanaging supervisor from the prior job. It was so much better, and paid better. Until I just got notice that I was laid off.

My recruiter was unable to tell me why. She was so apologetic that she had to tell me tonight and vowed to work with me on Wednesday to find out why, and to find another job. From what I understood, I was doing great! She'd heard that too. So we think it was a budget decision. 

I'm scared and relieved. I want to find something where the workload is closer to my expertise and the pay is more commensurate with my level of education. My boyfriend, bless his soul, offered to carry me with what little he has. When it comes to my bills, I just can't let myself be a burden to him and I'll wait tables or do retail until I can find the right job. My bills are pretty light, but I'll run out of savings in a few months.  

If I had money, I'd start a non-profit. My dream is to create something that would benefit people - and I had planned to do that next year, while a full-time job paid the bills. I know exactly what I'd do.... it would be beautiful. 

I can also apply for jobs in academia. That may be more suitable for me than the corporate world. I messed up, though - I went to an online school for my degree - it's accredited - because I was able to maintain a full time job, support my ex, do internships, and go to school full time all at the same time. I didn't focus on publishing papers. However, I have a ton of company-based research and program evaluation under my belt...  I'm going to see if that will fly. 

Am I narcissistic myself for putting this out there and thinking someone is going to read it all the way through? This feels like one of those cheesy ""dear diary"" entries. ""Dear Diary, WTF am I supposed to do now?""

I've never been in love like this before, and I've never been let go, either. I think the universe is pushing me in a specific direction.

25,"Now, I love McDonalds. I probably eat something from there a handful of times a month and I used to LOVE their burgers. But, I stopped ordering the burgers because after a while, I noticed that I'd feel really ill after eating them. So, I moved onto nuggets and I love the nuggets and they're great, but today, I ordered a cheeseburger to go with my nuggets. I figured it would make a good snack for later.

Fast-forward to me waking up from my nap and deciding to go and eat said cheeseburger. It's good at first and I'm just sitting at my laptop watching a Netflix series, but then out of nowhere I just start retching and I have to make a beeline for the bathroom and spit it out because it's starting to make me feel physically sick. I was dry-heaving for a good minute or so before I washed my mouth out, got mouthwash, brushed my teeth, brushed my tongue, got all of it out and then downed a whole load of water. Ugh. It might be a me thing rather than a McDonalds thing (as I've had burgers from there before and not felt 'ill' afterwards) but I'm just wondering if anyone can relate to this",01Jan2019,1

      I’m just wondering what other things I should keep in there? Probably a better blanket, a flashlight, back up phone charger? Has there been anything you wish you had when your car broke down, or something that would have been nice to have in a pinch?
       I’m also thinking of packing a backpack to keep in my trunk, with some of these things, but also back up clothes (pajamas, normal day clothes, socks, undergarments, etc...) with like a toothbrush and stuff, some back up cash, just in case. In case  I spontaneously spend the night at a friends house, in case I get stuck somewhere unplanned overnight, in case for some reason I decide to go somewhere. I’ll be 18 in just a few months, and something about my anxiety/depression is rlly making me feel like I need to change things up. I want to take a day trip, I want to go somewhere new.

It's only been 20 days. My cat has been in my life for just over a week. I didn't think it would happen. I didn't think I was enough, that this... trainwreck my life has been had some protection by law, that my doctor's letter would be enough for them, but here she is and I never knew what a small thing like having a little furry, purring, living, pooping being to worry about outside of myself would make everything better. She's 12lbs of skittish love and I am so lucky. I feel like a dumbass, a fool, but her little paws kneading my leg and her meows make me forget about my stupid, obsessive, mental bullshit for a while. My boyfriend has said that she even helps him and that this week he has felt less stressed, a bit happier, maybe a tiny bit less depressed.

Right now she's cuddling my leg, peeking at me every now and then over blankets. It's been a long time since I cried out of happiness.

By 4 30 i finally got her and the friend to leave. We went to our apt of me and gfs. Her friend says she can't go home at this time (5 am). Its a studio apt so i suggest i sleep on the floor while they share the bed. Gf says no we all share it. By around 7 we fall asleep. 8 30 i wake up to her beating she shit out of me and screaming how she hates me and that i should've left to my parents home which was 15 min taxi ride but i couldn't since i have no keys and they're sleeping. She said its fine and i don't have to. Anyways her friend wakes up and is in shock. Me too. I got a cab and left. The relationship was shit anyways, this isn't even the worst thing that happened, so im not even mad lmao. Imagine that. She once kicked me out in another city i went to visit her at 2 am and i basically had to buy a ticket home and waited for like 8 hours at the airport. Hitting is also nothing new. Im just stupid for believing in love and forgiving everything. I finally believe im done and i can move on. A fresh start to a new year. Here's to a good start. Happy new years! I haven't slept since yesterday so im gonna try and sleep now. 1 year dating btw. And the red flags started after the first week of dating. But i ignored all with excuses cuz i had a massive crush on her 2 years ago. And also this type of behavior is widely acceptable here in russia. Her mother's friend, her husband got a knife a week ago and went to her wife's job threatening to kill her cuz she didnt sell their 10 yo kid whom he sent a pack of cigarettes, shes a cashier btw. My gfs, well exs mon was there too and called her brother, yes, not the police, her brother. The husband called before hand that he is coming with a knife. The brother came and beat him and took the knife. He went home. No police. 5 days later they're all celebrating new year's eve together. I don't know why i shared that, just to show how people are here. Im not originally from here, and i never was in a relationship. So i didn't have a good example to compare to.

It just sucks because there’s some stuff I know she would be so into that I’ve been into lately and we could geek out about it and have fun but it’s not possible now. I wish I could tell her I feel that way. It’s been a couple years now and I should probably just get over it. It’s just hard to lose a friend when you don’t really understand why. I miss her.

48,"I wanna start by saying.. I've posted this type of thing a lot of times to advice subreddits and relationship subreddits, and every time, one way or another, I'm told that I am in the wrong here. But this time, I just want to be listened to. There's so much going on here and I just have to write it out, and maybe I'll feel better. I'm going to be vague, but as specific as possible so you can get the picture, but I have to be vague because my girlfriend browses reddit and I don't want to risk her seeing this.

&amp;#x200B;

Where to start... first, let me say that I have a couple of things wrong with me. The first one being an extremely hindering mental disorder that requires me to do things in a very specific way, or I have very, very bad days. The second being... I don't even know what you'd call it... sociopathy or just plain apathy... I don't think I'm a sociopath because I really do care about other people, it's just that I have a very hard time empathizing with people who aren't me. I know, ironic that I want strangers to listen to my story when I can barely listen to other people... I hope I still have you reading.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, after being together for a while, my girlfriend and I decided it was time to move in together. I talked a lot about this with my dad, and he said that if I move out now, that would be it. He wouldn't be a crutch anymore. And I see that as completely fair. I also felt the urge to move out because I'm getting to the age where living with my parents would be something I try to hide. Moving out was hard... I cried a lot, and that's something I barely do. Really not trying to sound tough, I'm just not a crier, but no hate to people who do cry a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, things seemed to be coming along well with my girlfriend, but then we started getting into big arguments. Here's where other people have said I am wrong, and after reflecting on it a lot, I think I agree, but I don't know how to fix myself. Our arguments would start out with me picking on her mildly. Not even anything that matters, stuff like me making silly voices or calling her completely irrelevant names, stuff that obviously does not apply to her. I can see how that can be taken as me being a dick, but I digress. Other things that would start arguments would be me tickling her, which to an extent I can see how it's annoying... but she would really start yelling at me even if I stopped when she told me to. This is relevant to my sociopathy condition because I guess I can't really see how what I'm doing is that bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I came to realize that I guess I just annoy her a lot. Recently, I've just been trying to leave her alone more, but I can't find the balance. She wants me to just lay with her... just lay there. Forgive me, but that's boring. Of course I love her, but there are other ways to show affection than just... laying. I started watching shows with her and that kind of quelled that period of the relationship. She seemed happy... minimal physical engagement other than just cuddling and kissing and the do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to the past week. I fucked up big time on Christmas day because I worked that morning, early in the morning, and went to my dad's to see him for christmas, with my girlfriend of course. Then we went home before going to my mom's, and I dozed off. Well, apparently she didn't think to wake me up before leaving, or if she did I was too asleep to remember, because I woke up 2 hours after having supposed to be there to my girlfriend, my sister, and my brother all telling me to get up and come on over. I can understand how I seem like a dick here: I said no to that. The reason being is that my mom's side of the family is HUGE. And they like to talk. I did not want to just get up out of bed, not ready or looking nice, just to go get shit from my family for a half hour, then sit on the couch until we finally leave. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, they all went back to my mom's without me, and I went back to bed. I woke up again to my girlfriend slamming stuff in our apartment... the walls are thin, mind you, so our downstairs neighbors got to suffer through this too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Holiday #1 of the season fucked up. Holiday #2, new years eve, AKA, today.

&amp;#x200B;

I had to work late today, and my girlfriend did too, and got off 2 hours after me. She begged me to get out of my routine for tonight so we could celebrate new years together, and we could have our new year's kiss. I reluctantly agreed. Although I knew that breaking my routine would seriously fuck up my mentality for the rest of the night, I really wanted to make it right because different circumstances hadn't allowed us to have our new year's kiss for the past couple years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I sat there just kind of trying to distract myself from the impending overload/breakdown of my emotions due to my condition. Then my girlfriend finally got home, and was telling me about how she wants to go hang out with her friends for NYE. Ok, fine. I understand. She invited me, but I said no because I don't know any of those people, and the last thing I want to do tonight after breaking my routine is interact with people all while trying to keep my cool... which is difficult (I can't stress this enough). 

&amp;#x200B;

To her credit, she stayed until 12 and we finally had our long awaited new year's kiss. Here is a side story I haven't told you, though. There is a guy she works with who I am extremely jealous of... call him Nathan. She tells me about Nathan a lot. Sometimes, she'll show me text conversations between them when Nathan has said/sent something funny. I fake laugh as I read texts from her that don't seem like her... she sends her messages in a more ""cute"" way to him than she does to me. If I get any more specific, then my girlfriend would know this is me. I'm tired of hearing about Nathan, but I do not want to limit her friendships with other males because of my jealousy (this was a big hurdle early in our relationship, but I fought long and hard to get over it, with some success). 

&amp;#x200B;

Back to now, she told me Nathan is at this party. I say ok. Be careful. Inside I really do not want her to go, but outside I am telling her to have fun but please be careful. Again, I don't want to limit her or be controlling, but I can't help but entertain that nagging feeling in my head. She keeps asking me if it's ok and I finally say no, but please go anyways because I don't want her night to be ruined on account of my problems. She says alright. 

&amp;#x200B;

The worst part about this jealousy is that I can't tell her about it. I have to pretend I'm ok. In the past, whenever I have brought up feelings about stuff (not just jealous feelings), she ends up yelling at me, telling me how it's always about me, etcetera. I tell her I just wanted to say how I was feeling, and the only reason I even argue with her is because I want to defend my emotions. Not the reasons I have them, but just the emotions themselves. I can't help what I feel, and relationships are supposed to be supportive of each others' emotions. But I get argued with instead. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now I'm here, worried as hell about her. And typing this didn't make me feel better at all. So now I wait for her to get back because I can't stand the thought of something happening to her.

49,"2018 was a rough one. I distanced myself from a toxic friend group resulting in me feeling more alone than ever. But I stood up against them for what I felt was right and I know this will be better for me in the long run. 

This year I will find people who actually care about me and support my interests and are just genuine people. 

This year I will explore and embrace my creative hobbies and interests. I will make music and art and conquer my fear of putting it out there. 

I will get in the best shape of my life (starting from the worst I've ever been currently). 

I will put myself out there and ignore my worries about being judged. 

I will overcome negative feelings and experiences and learn from them. 

This year I will better myself. This is the beginning of the rest of my life and I'm so excited to live it.

50,"2018 was a great year for me in terms of personal growth and confidence. But I don’t think I do enough. I work and I go to school. I have plenty of interests and hobbies, yet I enjoy them all alone. I have friends, even a best friend, but I’m still very closed off sometimes. I’m always praised in my relationship advice towards friends, yet I haven’t made any efforts to start romantic relationships of my own. I feel like I have all of this potential in life on a creative, social, and romantic level, but I constantly suppress it all beneath a cloak of self doubt and a lack of direction.

Over the past few years, I’ve lasted the groundwork for the person I’m meant to be. Now I just need to concentrate on living a fuller life in order to become that person. I want to see more concerts, I want to laugh and love and cry more, I want to understand more, and most importantly, I want to live up to my own expectations.",01Jan2019,1
51,"2018 started off with my uncle passing away. While I wasn’t close to him, my whole family went through a month of mourning and confusion because of how unexpected it was. In April, my grandma also passed, causing another month of turmoil. I was much closer to her, and it was the first time I’ve ever seen my dad break down. During the summer, my girlfriend told me she had to transfer schools because her parents didn’t approve of our relationship. She was my first love but we don’t talk anymore because of misunderstandings.

You could say my 2018 was a shit year.

Before now, I didn’t realize how much this past year had hurt me. My life changed so much during these past months, and I’m not sure if it was for the better. I think 2019 has to be a year where I heal from this past year. Cheers to new beginnings. Wish me luck",01Jan2019,1
52,"The positive parts, I know I should appreciate that more. Went from a job that was killing me inside, to a job I think I can love. 

What bothers me is this: I was hired as a supervisor, and one of my employees just wasn't happy about it. She wanted my job, but she lacked the experience and ability to do the job. I tried to develop the team, including her, but she resisted every opportunity to be part of the improvements. My boss *really* wanted her gone, but was fine as long as I had to deal with her. The head of the org wanted to keep experienced people, as do I.

I tried so many ways and so many times to get her to see that she was valuable to me and the org. To give her opportunities she asked for. She dropped the ball every time, then complained that we weren't appreciating her skills.

Eventually, she took another job, with another org, for a slight pay increase. Burned her bridges leaving, which was stupid .

So... I know it was for the best, for our team. We're coming together well, and my boss is embarrassingly happy.

Still, I wish I'd been able to help my former staffer to grow, both personally and professionally. She hates her new job. Has not learned that it's not always everything outside of her that's the problem ... she's playing life in hard mode.

I am 34 and have worked in healthcare. Over the years I have always been there for people. To listen and guide and support.

I then took a coaching course and it woke something inside. Something I hadn’t felt before. I love it and realised it was I have been naturally doing for most of my life.

So now I am about to embark on an official coaching course. 

Initially I’ll be using it in my role as deputy training manager working within staff development but I really feel I want to spread my wings and start my own business.

The business model would allow me to do it alongside my current job until it takes off, a luxury many others don’t have and I am so grateful to be in this position.

I’d like to work with individuals and teams to help individuals and businesses improve themselves. I do team development now and I love it. It’s hard but rewarding.

I’ve struggles a lot in my life with anxiety and stress but now my life feels like it’s coming together and this feels like a major discovery that although those problems still exist I feel knowing this will help.

So that’s me and my little off load. It just feels a little silly that my life goal is to help others find theirs and get the best out of themselves.

This isn’t life coaching but personal and team development coaching so it is in a more professional framework.

The actual business would be personal and team development consultancy offering coaching and advice on how people can ensure their internal programmes get the best out of people. 

If I can help one person or business I’ll be happy!!

63,"I just wanted to write it down. Because the overwhelming feeling of happy and glad are just washing over me. 

There is no alcohol in my system. There are no drugs. Yet I feel alive and elevated and like the last year of my life has transformed who I am as a person and my environment.

At this time last year I was sleeping up to 14 hours a day. I’d get up to go to work unshowered often. I would spend so much money on sugar and junk food and drinks. I was so depressed. A man had just not only hurt me but said some of the nastiest things to me. His last text before I blocked him was “I feel sorry for whoever ends up with you.” 

Shortly after, within the next 3 weeks, my parents both sent me emails telling me what a shit human I was. How they couldn’t support me because I was working in the casino industry and left the church. How I was going to hell unless I changed. How ungrateful and selfish I was. They were long emails. I kept begging my mother to leave me alone (we live 1000 miles apart) but she would emotionally bully me daily. I begged her telling her I didn’t have the capacity to deal with what she was throwing at me. She told me I was self centered and selfish for that. 

I was going to kill myself.

When I told my best friend she said she was depressed too and waved it off. She was upset over a guy at the time. 

I arranged for my cat to go to a good home. I wrote my work life insurance benefactor in as various local charities. 

I was pretty. I was financially doing fairly well. I had a brand new car. Still young at 26, bilingual, with an education and full time work. And I wanted nothing more than to not exist because the crushing hopelessness of life and lack of love in my life was eating me. There was almost nothing left. I bought more and more expensive clothes, I went to clubs to feel alive, I downloaded dating apps to validate myself. I kept sinking. 

The only reason I didn’t do it was because of my grandparents. They’re 77. It would break their hearts. They’re angels. I call them on skype a few times a week. I couldn’t repay their lifelong kindness with this. 

So I made the decision to do everything I can. Until they pass, I had that long to fix my life and find the will to live. 

I took a soul searching trip to Hawaii to start. It was a trip I was supposed to take with my mother originally but she.... bailed. I cut contact with her and my father. All contact. I started therapy. I started strict keto. I started going to the gym and taking my vitamins. I made a point to watch positive tv and read educational and stimulating materials. 

I did this since last January. It’s now January 1, a year later. I can’t say it fully worked, because I sometimes still want to kill myself. But I’ve found a common language with my parents after 11 months of silence. I cut my best friend out of my life after realizing that I was being used to feed her emotional needs. I had several very good and positive relationships that ended on a good note and taught me a lot. I went through a sexual revolution and discovered a whole new side of myself. I found out what loving yourself means, because I only thought I knew before. I changed my toxic habits - because often the most toxic person in my life was me. I also learned to forgive myself.

And lastly, I met a man who isn’t even in the same category as the others have been. I was in love with him from day one, and he makes me a better person and compliments every part of my personality perfectly - and I his. I truly believe this is my other half, even though it is fairly early on. He makes me so excited for the future and completely takes away my anxieties. 

And now I’m typing this sitting in the car. I have hope. And if nothing else this year, that is the most major change that I’ve gone through. I found hope. 

I just wanted to share this. For my own records if no one else’s. ",01Jan2019,1

I do miss them, and I do love them deeply, but hubs is going back to work soon, so this time is kind of my last hurrah for doing whatever the heck I want to do. 

So, yesterday, my friend took me to experience folks playing their passions. It was glorious. Unable to express myself with the appropriate words. Just, imagine expressing yourself through something you are passionate about, and then how it would feel to be around dozens of other folks doing the same thing - and then absorbing all of that love. It sounds dumb but idgaf. I just spent the first nearly five hours of the new year’s being the drunkest I’ve been ever in life (all worn off now, and no spins!), dancing, and creating art (or painting because I’m really not that fancy or even good at it, but also idgaf).

65,"Mid 2018 I was able to overcome depression and finally step back and get to know myself.

“do you need x or y?” If we are at a grocery.. or if they say I’d like this or that item and a random person looks. 

I want to blend in when I’m out, but most importantly I hate having any detail of my life spilled near complete strangers, I’ve been on the verge of tears a few times. 

If my sister told a friend of hers (that I don’t know) about me liking x or y food.. I wouldn’t bother, 

I can be a goof when I’m with friends and have no problem sharing intimate things sometimes... but having a stranger listen to small details about me makes me *so damn uncomfortable.*

I’ve asked the person who does this a lot to stop.. I asked **multiple times** but they do it anyway.  

I also have a a very. “ethnic” name, I **absolutely hate it when this person calls me by it in public**, it calls attention.. I’ve asked kindly to call me something else (even a nickname). 

I’ve never felt this way near 80% of my friends, only some people. 

I used to frequent a place with this person (who’s kinda.. careless), months after (somewhere else) I’m approached by this guy.. he tells me that he saw me more than 10 times at that place.. probably sometimes sitting near the table and all.. he has been watching me. I’ve encountered that guy more two times, he didn’t leave me alone and kept staring (without blinking). I had to leave even.

It makes my blood boil to remember how many personal things were just thrown in the wind for this random guy. 

I’m sad now",01Jan2019,1
66,I feel it. I need to stop thinking what other people think and focus on improving myself so I can be the best me that I can be. I know that I can be so much more than what I am currently. By the end of this year I will have a banging body and the confidence to back it up. I will not be afraid of cameras. I will not be afraid to wear clothes that I want to wear. I can stay persistent and achieve goals that I have been dreaming about for *years* in 1 year or less. I am excited for what this new year will bring. ,01Jan2019,1

I woke up a few hours later to my bf hovering over me and kissing my face, telling me how much he loves me in a soft voice. Then he embraced me and kind of nuzzled my neck before going back to bed.

I try hard to make people laugh so they like me. I want to have friends. But i feel like im very passive aggressive and say mean things to them. Because i want them feel the same way i do...
So selfish i know. 

But what makes someone empty headed loser? A mindless loser? Narrow minded? Absent minded? Moronic? Stupid? Foolish? Dumb? How do i be a man? Do i have to be serious about everything? Or never serious? 

I feel like the worlds most piece of shit person. I feel so low and feel like others never ever value me and feel like they see me as inferior and naive and brainless guy with no personality.

I feel inane, ludicrous, daft, bonehead, witless, nonsensical.. 

And i fap a lot. And i feel like i have to stop lookinh for approval of others. Might fix most things but there are a lot of things going on my head about whats wrong with me.

74,"I’m 19. 2018 was a tough one. I had some greats moments like going on holiday for the first time in 6 years with my girlfriend. However most of my great moments were with her. Since we went to uni in September on opposites sides of Britain, our emotional relationship deteriorated within a month due to long distance and our lives changing (we avoided talking about us and uni before we went.which was stupid)

We were both introverted people who liked spending time with each other over the last 3 years, we didn’t really like going out drinking/partying. Once at uni, she got into to that lifestyle ( I enjoy it too now but not as much as her). She was my best friend and she visited me within 2 weeks of uni for my birthday on a 7 hour train for only 36hours. I felt like we had a great time drinking and hanging out with my flat. I felt like we emotional to see each other and it felt it in the intimacy. When we parted at that station I was tearful on the walk home, as I loved her so much and I was thinking I made a mistake moving far way.

Within 2 weeks, we were speaking on FaceTime when she said she wanted to be friends with benefits (alarm bells should have rung here in hindsight) as we’re  both so far away and can’t afford to see each other. At the time, I was emotional but I thought it could work. (I had some similar feelings)

In my mind I thought this would be great for us as it meant we could still be best friends and still enjoy the sex life that we knew, when we were back home. Whilst still being able to get our sexual needs through new experiences at uni in causal hookups. 

This was all going well for 2 weeks following this, I had flirted with a girl and we stared to tongue. I however wasn’t feeling it. (I know now that I hadn’t been able to process my emotions) all I could think about was my gf, I felt shit and I told her. She said it was okay. 

At the end of this 2 week period, my fwb gf told me she no longer wanted to be that. She said she wasn’t comfortable being with more than 1 person at once, she said she met some guy on her course who she’s been flirting with. As a result we could no longer be fwb according to her. This brought all my emotions out, I was angry as the thought of someone else being intimate with her when I couldn’t, this tore me apart and it made me start doubting what she originally intended and weather she had been flirting with him since the start of uni.

We didn’t talk for 3 weeks following me learning this.  This period was awful for me,  as stated before she was my best friend and the only person I truly trusted (this is because when I was 15/16, I was in a toxic friend group who ended up bullying me and this traumatic experience has made it extremely hard for me to establish strong bonds with any new friendships.) I felt so alone, I didn’t want to go out. I felt the person who knew me best had just thrown me to the curb. I knew from experience she’s got a hidden horny personality so that was hurting me, the thought of her fucking other guys. And I kept thinking back to when she visited me the month previous and how we were. 

Uni as a result hasn’t been going great so far for me, due to this and my loneliness. I was homesick as my university’s in a small town in the middle of winter which was making me depressed, I felt like I no longer had someone I could confide it and truly cared about me. 

Since being home, I’ve been better as I’ve been able to socialise with my brothers. However I wanted to meet up with my ex to have a talk. We did,  I told her I still want to be friends and that I still find her attractive.  She wasn’t as clear. I asked her for feedback on what I can improve personality, sexually etc moving forward. She gave me some which I valued. After a while it felt like how it used to be and I felt comfortable around her. She makes me happy and I felt it as I walking around the park with her.  We both became more open regarding questions, I asked how she honestly found me during sex, she said I was good and needed to focus on using the tongue more. I thought this was fair enough and I valued the feedback.  Then she said I was better than this new guy who struggles it get it up and makes her feel a bit awkward. This gave my ego a boost.  She said I need to improve with manners and that I sometimes speak bad to my mum, all of this is very valid and I am aware of this. She said it was shitty how she handled breaking us up. she said she wanted to break up but didn’t know how to and wanted to do it in person but physically couldn’t unless it was on my birthday. 

Later we messaged each other, we talked about how we differed on things that made it hard to stay emotionally engaged at the distance, what things we should have done differently and that we should have been more open with each other and had a proper discussion to discuss anything we weren’t happy about. I revealed to her how I’ve been suffering mentally the last year or two; including a porn habit that’s almost daily and I told her about the abuse I went through and how that damaged me mentally towards  trusting new friendships.  And how that impacted how I relied on her as my best friend. 

We’re still friends now but keeping contact to a minimum to help me get over her. I miss the intimacy and having someone I can hug and talk too. Its hard not to feel sad seeing her out on Snapchat with friends while I’m alone, It’s been tough.

Moving forward into 2019. I’m going to see a therapist back at uni and hopefully talk to them about my porn habit, loneliness and my traumatic friendship experience.  I’m thinking of joining the campus gym to get myself into shape and make me active a way from my desk. A friend at uni might join with me, I get on well with him, he just lives 1 hour away so don’t see him all the time. I’m going to look for new hobbies and my flatmate said she’ll try to teach me how to crochet. I’m going to go to the film society to see if I can meet new people that I click with and I want to become more confident to be able to have more experiences with other girls on nights out.

80,"Every time I open up any US-centric political sub, I see stories about how ""the walls are closing in"" and that ""things are going to get very bad"" for the current US regime. Coming from a family where both suicide and narcissism have been historical issues, I put on my narcissist cap and have come to the conclusion that the end of the Trump regime is not going to be a clean one.

Growing up, I heard stories of my maternal grandmother (prime grade r/raisedbynarcissists material) having done suicide attempts to curry pity among her gaslit children and I see the same qualities in Trump, a man who has never had to function in the ""real"" world. I think that if things got bad, he would seriously consider such a drastic solution and here's  why I think he would be unhinged enough to do so.

1. He would dance away from any fallout from the plethora of investigations, any Congressional subpoenas, or the looming economic downturn. Because he would be dead.
2. Not living would probably make the Mueller investigation, the state level investigations, even anything else that he may be linked to probably be settled because you can't convict a dead man. It would keep the nefarious acts that he has done from really coming out in the open and even if they did it wouldn't affect him.
3. Death has a habit of canceling out all the bad things a person has done. ""President who killed themselves"" is much more memorable in the eyes of history than ""Affluenza-racked Narcissist Perverted Asshole Rapist"". It also would make him into a sympathetic figure - sure he was an asshole but he killed himself in office so that erases all the bad.
4. Such a end might, especially in his mind, get Ivana's kids off the hook because, well, it would be in poor taste to indict them so soon after their father committed suicide. I've dealt with the fallout of indictments and have seen people spared one out of circumstance, I think that if lesser people can be spared so can those three. A payment to spare them in a way.
5. This would sow even more of the discord that Russia so badly wants. What way to own the liberals one more time than to put them in the position of celebrating the death of a suicide victim and to own them further via openly shaming them for ""not mourning your president"" upon his tragic passing. You then end up with a volatile 2020 election and the chance to wreck more havoc.
6. Imagine this going off on live TV, like the Budd Dwyer suicide on steroids. His blood spilling over the Resolute Desk would be a final ""screw you"" to the American people as would the Oval Office becoming a crime scene. The psychological toll of seeing the President blow his brains out on National TV may be 9/11/01 or 11/22/63-level demoralizing.
7. I've seen people more mentally stable fold under pressure far great than this. Let's remember that the man has never had to really deal with the real world and outside of his time at NYMA has never really had to answer with anyone. Most other politicians, a la LaDavid Johnson in Niger, knew what they signed up for and it's apparent that Donald did not.

Yes, I know I might be crazy, but I just can't shake this. The warning signs are just there especially the idea that without him his family would suffer less.",01Jan2019,1
81,"I'm surrounded by people but I feel alone so I made a blog where I just talk about stuff happening to me and random rants and stories

85,"I used to cut myself a lot when I was down. I felt like there were no other options but to let my blood flow as it carried out some pain in me. Seeing my blood helped me calm down and achieve peace of mind. I would use anything nearby from a broken ruler end/shattered glass to razor blades. 

One day my friend caught me and made me promise to never do it again. She made sure I got the help I needed by just being there for me. With her distracting my mind, I soon started doing healthy stuff to calm myself instead of cutting myself. And so thanks to her making me promise 8 years ago, I am now not harming myself. 

I am grateful for what she did and hope everyone gets a friend like her.

86,"*names have been changed*

so my mother in law, kathy, works for a pretty nice company, she’s been there for about 20 years. she was married to an asshole named mark at the beginning of her career there. when she first started working there, she became friends with this guy in her department named brent. over the years her and brent got really close and became great friends. she confided in him about mark and problems she had to deal with- with him. about 6 or 7 years into their friendship, brent confessed to kathy that he was in love with her and that he wanted her to leave mark and be with him. (brent was engaged at the time of him confessing that he loves kathy) brent said he would call off his engagement and wanted them to be together but my mother in law told him she couldn’t and that she was trying to make her marriage work with mark because they had a child together recently. brent went off and got married and him and his wife had a daughter who is about 8 or 9 years old now. 
(not relevant yet but brent doesn’t have a drivers license due to multiple dui’s and not paying his fines that he has to pay. he hasn’t had his license in at least 10 years. brent has issues with drinking and gambling). 
about 4 years ago, kathy finally gathered up the courage to divorce mark and shortly after, her and brent were dating. brent was still living at home but told kathy he’s in the process of getting a divorce from his wife, tonya. brent and tonya werent happy together and from his stories, she neglected their daughter a lot. while the divorce was still going through its finalizations, brent was still living at home with his soon-to-be ex wife because his daughter was there and was fearful to leave her alone with tonya. kathy was okay with this, she didn’t want to rush this process for him or seem like she was trying to come in between brent and his daughter. after kathy’s divorce, though, she wasn’t able to afford her house anymore and ended up moving about 30 mins away from her work and where she was living previously so she could live pretty much down the road from brent. she figured if she moves closer to him, he could spend time with kathy, still be close to his daughter and he could eventually move in with her once the divorce was finalized and his daughter could come over whenever because she got a place with an extra bedroom.

fast forward to a year and a half into their relationship, brent is living with kathy but she is also letting brent take her car every single day to go to his wife’s house and see their daughter.
kathy eventually found out that brent lied and never actually filed for divorce because he was scared that tonya would make it so he can’t have any custody of their daughter since he has multiple dui’s, unpaid fines and no drivers license. kathy was super upset that he lied to her for so long (and i wish she would have cut it off then) but she forgave him. he told her everything she wanted to hear and that he would get the divorce once he pays his fines off and once he takes care of anything the courts could “use against him” if they had to battle for custody. 
brent has painted this big picture for our whole family that his wife is this awful crazy mother who neglects their daughter, he says they don’t speak and that whenever he goes to see his daughter, tonya leaves the house because they can’t be in the same place together at once. kathy just kind of held onto that every time she was feeling upset that she was alone all day while he was at his wife’s house.. it was okay because brent and tonya don’t speak to each other so there’s nothing to worry about.

fast forward to 2018. my mother in law is still living down the road from brent’s house, who is STILL married. brent refuses to even talk about getting a divorce at this point and kathy just wants it to work so bad because her last marriage was shit. in my opinion, their relationship shouldn’t have lasted this long at all. he’s drunk all the time and she’s been drinking noticeably more. when i first met her i hardly ever saw her drink but since he’s came into her life more heavily she’s been drinking more, too. kathy has a huge heart and is one of the best people i know, all of us have always said she deserves better but we tried tolerating him because we knew how much she cared for him. then there was an incident earlier in 2018 where my boyfriend had to go pick his mom and brent up from the casino because they were way too drunk to drive. my boyfriend and his little brother went to pick them up and brent and kathy sat in the back seat. kathy tried going through brent’s phone during the car ride and brent freaked out on her and ended up hitting her in the face while my boyfriend is driving. my boyfriend starts screaming at him to stop and brent proceeded to try and grab the steering wheel from the back while my boyfriend is driving on the highway. boyfriends little brother tries interfering and brent choked him. they pulled over in some parking lot and kathy literally kicked him out of the car and they left him laying on the ground in this parking lot. we thought they had to be done after that.. until we came over to her house a few days later and saw then sitting together on her couch. at this point we all hated him and we just wanted her to end it, move out of that city and move back closer to us and her job. 
in early november her and brent went to a bar about 45 minutes away from their place and
they got into a pretty big argument there and kathy left him stranded at this bar with no way home. she got home and packed up all of his stuff and threw it in her car that night.. a few hours later she was starting to feel really shitty about leaving him there with no way home and she was trying to text him and no texts would go through and she tried to call him and his phone went straight to voicemail. she didn’t really sleep that night because she was so worried about what could’ve happened to him. the next day she gets a call from him saying he was at his cousins house in that city that the bar was in and that he’ll come home so they can talk later that day. he came home to kathy and said his cousin picked him up that night and let him stay the night and he apologized for whatever they fought about. she forgave him. so my mother in law was telling me all of this and she said once her and brent made up, brent came up to her and laid next to her and put his head in her lap and said to her, “how about we make a deal?” and she asked what it was and he says “i figure i have about 60 days left in me before i die, can you just ride them out with me?” and she asked why he would say that and he just kind of brushed it off. very strange thing to say but she kind of let it go. literally the next week after that, bernie was sick with the flu so he stayed home from work for a couple of days and kathy said he was just sleeping all day long and didn’t have energy for anything. friday during the week of him being sick, he tried getting up for work and kathy told him he should stay home because he was not in good shape at all for work because he was still pretty sick. he stayed home. she was texting him that day asking if he needs to go to the emergency room and he said that he was going to try and ride it out the rest of the day/night and if he still felt bad saturday morning then she could take him in. brent woke up at 2:30 AM that saturday morning gasping for air and wheezing terribly. kathy took him to the emergency room thinking he just needed a breathing treatment and some antibiotics. they get there and the nurses are telling brent and my mother in law that they’ll be putting a ventilator in him to help his breathing and that they’ll be putting him in a medically induced coma. he had a very bad case of pneumonia and he had really bad blockage. brent also has diabetes (not sure which type) that he hasn’t been managing for 2+ years now. he was also having complications with his blood sugar, it was extremely low.
he got admitted on 12/1/18. my boyfriend and i went to the hospital later that day to see our mom and make sure she was doing okay and she was a wreck. all of the doctors were saying he wasn’t in good condition at all and that if she wouldn’t have taken him in when she did then he would’ve died in her bed. i asked her if she’s been trying to get ahold of his wife because they have a daughter together and if he wasn’t going to make it then they needed to be informed, especially if they were still legally married. she finally got ahold of brent’s brother who got ahold of tonya and told tonya everything about kathy. tonya had absolutely no idea brent was even in another relationship, let alone living with another woman. she apparently thought he’s been living with a guy from work for the past few years. 
my boyfriend and i left the hospital and shortly after that, tonya arrives. tonya saw kathy and just started asking kathy how long they’ve been together and how long brent has been living with her. tonya said she had no clue about her but that her and brent have been working on their marriage and he told her about a month ago that he’d be moving back home with her and their daughter. tonya said they would always go out and do things together as a family like see movies, get food, go shopping, etc. all in brent’s “new car” which really was my mother in laws car that she let brent use every single day while she was stuck at home by herself with no one to hangout with and no transportation. this was a huge slap in the face to our mom. tonya also mentioned that she had to go pick brent up from some bar 45 minutes away because he got left there with no way home.. which is when him and kathy got in that huge fight and he told her that he stayed at his cousins that night. i hate to say this but i feel like deep down she had to of known that there was still something going on between brent and tonya. he goes to his wife’s house every single day and they’re still married! but for some reason, kathy really trusted brent when he said there was no relationship between him and tonya and that they pretty much hated each other. after that she was just crushed. crying a LOT and really broken hearted. then about two days after they talked they found out that brent has sepsis and he took a turn for the worse. kathy was still going to see him even after all of this unfolded while he’s in this coma. she told us all she’s just sticking around to see if there’s even the slightest chance of him waking up and making it because she wants answers and closure. she wants to know how long he would have led this double life and how long he would have let this go on for and what his intentions were. around 12/15-12/16 a neurologist said that a scan shows brent has had several strokes since being in his coma and they won’t know the extent of the damage unless he stabilizes and is able to wake up which wasn’t looking likely. 
his birthday was 12/18 which he was still in a coma for. on 12/20, kathy got a call from the doctors saying brent is more stable and they’re going to ween him off sedation to see if he remains stable and if he does they’ll be removing the ventilator. he remained stable and they took the ventilator out. obviously having that in your throat for almost a month makes it so you can’t speak but he was awake. the strokes didn’t do any outside physical damage. he could move all of his extremities and both sides of his face worked as they should. 

kathy was still visiting him but not bringing up anything negative or anything to do with tonya because he still wasn’t in the right state of mind. they think he was suffering from “ICU delirium” because he was in there for nearly a month and seemed very confused about his whereabouts. a few days later and he finally started to talk a tiny bit. kathy would show him pictures of the two of them and she would point at himself in the picture and ask brent if he knows who that is and he would say no. she would point at herself and sometimes he would say yes and sometimes he would say no. then the next day he was talking to people but saying he was at work and that he needed to get his work done before his break, thinking the hospital was his job. she didn’t really feel like there was a good time to talk about everything that’s happened yet. he was going to be placed into a long term care facility for rehabilitation and learning to walk again and things like that. she went and saw him in the hospital last night and she said he was still talking and everything seemed pretty normal with him. then my boyfriend and i woke up to a text this morning saying brent had passed away at 10:30 PM last night. apparently his heart rate slowed down so much and they just couldn’t get it back up and he closed his eyes like he was going to sleep and never woke back up. 

* i’m sorry if this post is poorly written, my mind was all over the place writing this while trying to think of everything that’s happened these past few years. i don’t really know why i felt the need to share this. i hated the guy but still feel really weird that someone i’ve known and been around a lot has passed. the story is bizarre and my therapist thinks she should write a book lol*",01Jan2019,1

I went to my girlfriend’s house and had a great time for New Year’s. We watched Hellboy, made cookies, and I generally enjoyed myself. 2018 ended on a high note. 

Got home around 12:30 and I decided each of my cats were going to get a new year’s wish from me as well. (One is barely 4 months old, the two sibling cats are closer to 13 or 14 years)

I walk into my room, and my 13 year old cat has a black nose. Dried blood and a crater in his nose, incredibly reminiscent of cancer. Talked about it with my parents (I’m 19 and I live at home, no shame), we agreed if it is cancer, we’re putting him down. 

He’s had several other medical conditions, and he’s old and tired. He likely wouldn’t survive the treatment, so we won’t put him through it if it will just end in misery anyway. 

We’re scheduling a vet appointment ASAP, if this post gets any attention I’ll keep you guys updated.

91,"I just got back from a 10K barefoot and barechested run in the dead of a winter night. It's 12:34am right now, about 7 degrees outside.

I am firmly convinced that this, right here, is the greatest physical sensation a human can feel.

There is nothing more primal. The sensation of your naked feet striking the ground; your soles gripping the earth. The chilly wind hitting your skin, and yet you feel strangely fine as your body furnace is constantly burning fuel. The crisp air consistently flowing in and out of your lungs, free of any vehicle exhaust fumes. The dead silence at 12am and the only sounds are those of your feet thumping in steady motion. As you get into gear, you feel no sense of exhaustion at all, as if your legs can keep revving forever. You are lost in the moment, one with the earth.

Seriously, if you're not doing this, you're missing out on a major part of the human experience. Nothing comes close -- not even drugs, mindblowing sex, or the best food ever.",01Jan2019,1
92,"Ever since I’ve gone into high school, things have changed for the better and the worse, but the changes have been so drastic and radical that I begun to sloop down into a depression of some sort. Everything just sucks now, I can’t enjoy life with my friends like I used to anymore. At lunch, my friends seem so darn careless, the only thing they’d do is play video games in their cellphones until the bell had rung. It’s so stupid because people aren’t people anymore, they’ve become a part of their devices and technologies. It’s only on a rare occasion that I’d ever have fun around them, usually when they crack a joke or actually want to talk. Now I do have a great pal from Elementary who attends the same HS as I do, but it feels like we’re becoming more detached, I mean he’s gone M.I.A. for like entire lunch periods at a time. In all honesty, I lost my friends back in Elementary. I have poor social skills, am introverted, isolationist, and probably boring. Making new friends is probably the most difficult thing I could try to do, I feel like such a let down whenever I mess up during the “friend making” process. To pass the time at lunch, I just sit in the corridor on the floor listening to music, while my friends continue to play their games. Even asking a single question to them is difficult, they’re all hooked to some drug called Video Games. Now school and academics aren’t really much of a problem for me, mainly because I’m not a perfectionist and the work is fairly straightforward. But now when the Winter Break hit, it was not a break at all. Within the first few days, I went into madness from the boredom and loneliness I spent at home. I tried to talk to people, but they were all too busy enjoying their lives, I envy them. When Christmas came, it was different than the other years. Everything was so boring, as if I had burnt out long ago. I spent the next few days at home in boredom and crippling loneliness once again, like I have always been. One single break had to power to literally break down my mind psychologically, it might sound absurd, but it’s true. Over the five moths or so, I’ve done numerous depression related tests and they all point to one thing: BiPolar Depression. I spent a couple days just mass-watching Chills on YouTube for a couple days as entertainment, it was something I actually kinda enjoyed. I had to go to a New Year’s Party yesterday on January 31st. It was perhaps the most boring and mind degrading thing I have every experienced during the break, which is still going on. I’m sorry if this is hard to read or anything, I can’t think straight. I sat there for EIGHT hours doing nothing but talking to my friends on Discord or Instagram. Now we have more of a personal issue that I won’t discuss, but all I’ll say is that I feel like I had let myself and my friend down. If I had not been so blind and inconsiderate, I actually would’ve... crap, idk what to say. I just can’t forgive myself after what I did, even though it wasn’t anything bad. I failed. I just couldn’t stop thinking about how I ruined everything. During my third month of HS, I began to view myself as a loser, because I really am one. My entire year of 2018 was just full of failures, defeats, and blunders. I know that suicide is never an option and that God is always there for me. So prayer is something that really helps me when I’m down, but sometimes sadness can’t jus the simply broken. I look back at all of the things I could’ve done during the short time I’ve spent at High School, I’m full of regret. Everything about my life sucks, I really feel like I have little to no friends, I’m so damn lonely all the time, I mess up too often, I get frustrated too easily and nothing really seems to solve my problems anymore. If I could weep my sorrows away, I would but it seems I’m just not the type of person to do so. If anyone I know is reading this, it’s not your fault. I’m totally responsible for everything that’s happened to me. It’s because of my incompetence that I have failed you all. I now am going to go crawl back into my den until the sun returns and the break is over. Thank you for reading this, really.",01Jan2019,1
93,"New years eve was fine! Fun! Nice.
Then i had a nervous break down and a panic attack because of a few exams due in 5months...

It's not the first time that we went out with my boyfriend's friends, and i mentally collpased. Even though i love those guys! They are all fun and great people. But it takes a while for me to get comfortable enough to talk to them each occasion, then, after a few hours, my mind starts to wonder and i shut off. I stop responding, i ignore people, and i isolate myself involuntarily. And that's no good. It doesn't matter how loving my bf is (which is a lot) and how incredibly nice his friends are. I just can't get out of that zone.

I realize when it's happening, i just can't do much. I feel like there's nothing to do. But i have to find a solution.

98,"I'll delete this later, but I need to get it out of my system somehow. For context, we're both 16. So, my crush is the daughter of my dad's friend, just like last year they got invited at my house for the nye party. I see her often, we were together at christmas's Eve, and most saturdays, when her dad's schedule is free, we either all go to their place, or they come here. So, even though I like her more than I can ever describe, I didn't manage to actually properly talk to her yet, besides a couple of exchanges in group discussions. We have a lot in common. She likes to draw and paint, and since I used to do both pretty often, I decided to draw something, and maybe show her, and ask for some advice, to try and connect with her, and I also learned a song on guitar to play at the party, in hope to impress her. First plan didn't work, even though I drew a portrait of Tyrion Lannister that turned out better than I could ever hope for, but I didn't have time to make another drawing, and I ended up not asking her since there was never a chance where she wasn't near her dad or sisters, and I felt awkward. BUT, when I played that song, once I turned my head up, there she was, I saw her near her dad (who desperately wanted to hear me play for weeks) and my dad, and she complimented me, said that I was very good! That was awesome. Later, my dad told me that as soon as I started playing she came to see me as soon as she could :) But, since I didn't get a solid chance to talk to her, I was still pretty sad... This was the perfect day! This morning I kind of felt like shit honestly... Felt like crying a lot. I think it's due to the fact that it would be so easy to just go up to her, but I complicate my life with overthinking everything, and this only happens when I actually want t make a good impression on people I really really like, and it sucks. At lunch, my parents were talking about her, since they both paint just like she does, my dad has her number to exchange pics of their works, they told me they think she likes me, judging by the fact that she always sits near me every chance she has, she's always in the general area I'm in, she always smiles when she greets me, so her general behavior seems to indicate as much, they also told me they know I like her, since my expressions are apparently a dead giveaway. This cheered me up, along with the fact that she complimented me on my guitar playing, and the interest she showed. My dad told me he could give me her number if I want to, he'll just text her that he gave it to me and my mom, then I could text her asking about an anime she and her sister were recommending to my mother, who wants to watch it with me, so that could be a good excuse. Feeling a little better and hopeful about the situation after typing this out, sorry if it's a long read, and for the occasional grammar mistake, English is not my first language, and I'm in a rant mood today.

105,"Ok, so quick story for context. On Dec 19 I found a new house to live at but I realized the only way I could do that is if I pulled together thousands of dollars before the 1st of Jan. I drive cab at the moment so I was pulling all nighters and days while going through the Christmas season. In the middle of this chaos I came home to grab something to eat and my indigenous roommate, let's call him Mark, told me that he had a bad dream about my head dress and that its bringing me bad luck in my life and it needs to be destroyed. 

My response was ""I can see this is something that is really bothering you, and I don't necessarily understand where you're coming from, but if it means that much to you then we can destroy the head dress. The one thing I ask is if I can be there for that, i got this head dress at a music festival which I have extremely fond memories attached to this. It has a lot of sentamental value to me and I'd like to be in the proper headspace to let go of that attachment""

He agreed that he would wait until I could be there before destroying it. That day I drove until 7am which was a brutal shift by the way. Hit a garbage can on the road causing hundreds of dollars worth of damage that I'll be paying off over the month. Anyways.. so I came home and had a flight to go home to Alberta at 11:00am. I had 10 minutes in the early morning to pack before I had to catch a cab to the airport. I was in Alberta for a week with my family driving Limo with an old employer. Busy. So busy.

I finally make enough money and I come home to victoria to pack, I look up and see that the head dress that was in my room is gone. I send an email out to the house, I'll just copy and paste the raw emails:

""I'm packing up my room and unfortunately I'm angry while I'm doing it. Whoever went into my room without my permission while I'm away is incredibly disrespectful no matter what kind of reasoning or excuse is behind it. I'm not ok with this. I feel incredibly violated right now.""

Marks response:

""Yea that was me, i take full responsibility for entering your room. I didnt touch anything that was yours though. Just a racist synthetic headdress that had landed where it shouldnt have existed. So it was destroyed. My apologies for entering your room, but thats as far as my apologies extend on that matter""

My response:

""That is really not okay with me. We agreed I could be there for that. I was okay with destroying it as long as I was there for it because it did have sentimental value to me. I'm furious with you going in my space without even asking! ""

His response had pictures from a book called: ""United Nations Declaration of indigenous people""

Here is the section sited:

[Article 10
Indigenous peoples shall not be forcibly removed from their lands or territories. No relocation shall take place without the free, prior and informed consent of the indigenous peoples concerned and after agreement on just and fair compensation and, where possible, with the option of return.
Article 11
1. Indigenous peoples have the right to practise and revitalize their cultural traditions and customs. This includes the right to maintain, protect and develop the past, present and future manifestations of their cultures, such as archaeological and historical sites, artefacts, designs, ceremonies, technologies and visual and performing arts and literature.
2. States shall provide redress through effective mechanisms, which may include restitution, developed in conjunction with indigenous peoples, with respect to their cultural, intellectual, religious and spiritual property taken without their free, prior and informed consent or in violation of their laws, traditions and customs.
Article 12
1. Indigenous peoples have the right to manifest, practise, develop and teach their spiritual and religious traditions, customs and ceremonies; the right to maintain, protect, and have access in privacy to their religious and cultural sites; the right to the use and control of their ceremonial objects; and the right to the repatriation of their human remains.
2. States shall seek to enable the access and/or repatriation of ceremonial objects and human remains in their possession through fair, transparent and effective mechanisms developed in conjunction with indigenous peoples concerned.]

Ok so.. what are your thoughts? I understand that this ment a lot to him, but because of the sentimental value this particular item ment something to me too. I was willing to watch him do whatever he needed to do to feel better as long as I could be there for it, and he ignored that and did it anyways after verbally agreeing to those terms. He did not ask to enter my room while I was away. Help me understand how to approach this situation.

My neighbor left on 12/28/18 to go on a New Year's party in Ontario with her family and friends and left her mouse here. I don't know why she didn't bring it, but I don't own pets. She didn't ask me to housesit or anything.

On the night of the 28th I was very drunk and I broke into her house. Yes, stupid thing I did, but I was drunk. She didn't lock her back door, she only locked her front door, so I could go in without an issue or any locks stopping me.

For some reason while I was out of my mind, I decided to fill up her bathtub, walk into her living room, open the cage where her pet mouse was, grabbed it by the tail, walked into the bathroom, and threw it into the tub. I made the water really hot and filled it to the rim. I last remember that it was it trying to swim. This was around 10PM to 1AM. While you slept, a mouse died and was sitting in a tub. I think I passed out on the couch because on the 29th I was confused to what had happened. I was still in her house. I found the body of the mouse floating in the tub, it was dead. I got it out and laid it on a towel. I also drained the tub. Right now I'm freaking out. I have the mouse in the cage so maybe it will look like natural causes instead of drowning?

I work for the university year round and I volunteered to work the holiday break this year, and the time by myself has made me realize how much I depend on people for happiness and how little they need me for theirs. After my first year of college I thought that I had a ton of friends, but now I'm thinking that its just a lot of acquaintances. People know me and I occasionally get invited to things, but I don't think that I'm anybody's first thought for something. Whenever I want to do something that needs other people to keep it from being awkward or just depressing it feels like I have to beg people to come with me. I'm not dating anybody. I feel like I've asked enough people out to figure out that something must not be right on my side, and that I should focus more on self-improvement before I try and make someone carry my baggage too. 

I'm not really that active in my community. My major is film and media related so I've helped out on a few student productions, but other than that and my fraternity I'm not really involved in my school's community. It's kinda like the friend thing, people know who I am but it doesn't really go that much farther then that. All I really do in my free time is play videogames and paint DnD minis that I never use. 

Honestly, am I a loser or is this just what being an adult is like, and what do I do about it? I'm making my first short in a few months so I've doubled down to work on that, but are there any other suggestions for what I should do currently/after?

I kinda feel like writing down the story of my life because some shit happened the last few days and I feel kinda lonely.

Please bare in mind that I am not a native speaker but I try my best to get it right.

I am in a state of self loathing right now but I don't want to tell you how pitiful my life is which it isn't. But maybe you can get a kick out of the story and want to talk about it. And maybe talkiing about it will help me to reflect about it.

I left out a lot of details about other stuff but this was the first time writing all this down and I feeld it will take a lot of time and research to tell the whole story. My memory is very blurry, so I can't gurantee for any chronological order.

&amp;#x200B;

To start with a quote from one of my favourite video game characters ""here we goooooo!""

So I turned 24 in December and am enrolled in college since 5 years but won't finish because I got heavily into drugs and partying and needed some time to get my senses together (free education in my country, hooray)

I am clean for about 11 months right now and try my best to keep it like that. I focused a lot on working, saving money and making music during that time.

I was in therapy for two years until last month because I want to go travelling in the future and didn't want to block the spot for somebody else knowing I wouldn't be able to commit to a additional 1 year therapy period.

My dad was 18 when my mom who was 27 at that time got pregnant by him. She didn't know he was that young because he lied to her and looked a lot older. He's italian so got a full beard quite early. 

My mom is a PT and had her own practice and has always been very successful. She got my dad into becoming a PT and they opened a restaurant together. After buying a house together, having a restaurant, raising two children (I have a half brother 5 years older than me with whom I grew up) and working in my mother's practice he couldn't handle the responsibilities and flipped out. He wen't on some alcohol and coke binges, wrecked a car while DUI, had a lot of other women and left my mom all alone with all the things to manage. He assaulted her multiple times. She told me a story about him pushing her against a wall whilst choking her and my brother starting to cry plus shitting and pissing himself. He started wetting his bed for some years after this and my mom told me he was never the same after this. She even found a pistol under our couch pillows even though it's close to impossible for a normal civilian to get a weapon. 

A friend of my mom who had a very successful car dealership was helping here with this fucked up situation and gave her the keys to his summer house so we could get away from my dad. My dad was stalking her hardcore and went after her 1 day after we left. Some time later back in my home town my dad saw the car of this friend on front of my mother's practice and lost is shit. He smashed the car and left my mom with a debt of around 50k euros. The friend of my mom (let's call him P from here on) knew the situation she was in and waived the money we owed him. 

My mom moved in with P because she didn't feel save at home with two kids and he offered us to live with him. At this point I was about two years old. My father knowing what chaos he caused fled to Italy.

So now we are living with P whom my mother marries at some point. He had a lot of money and we lived in a very fancy house and even had a big mansion in a southern country. My mom sold her practice and became a stay at home mom. We flew to this mansion almost every weekend and holiday even though my brother and I begged to stay at home because spending so much time in solitude when all your friends are doing some cool shit together didn't feel nice even when it meant living in a big ass mansion other people dreamed of.

The other problem was that P barely came with us and mostly stayed in my home country and every time we came back to the mansion some stuff was stolen and thing were dearrranged. Well after being told by some neighbours that every  time we haven't been in the mansion there were parties going on with a lot of naked women and other shady stuf going on my mom gew suspicious. They started fighting a lot verbally and phiscally and at some point my mom finds out P used us as an aliby family because he's deep into some illegal car and people trafficing. After the divorce from P my mom got  told by a detective that we are lucky that we got out alive out of this whole situation because P fucked up badly.

Funny side story. Our best friends which were our neighbours and hung out everyday at our house (in my hometown) decided to steal our key and rob us after we were moving after the divorce. They even texted me when will be there the next time (I thought they were missing me). Those fuckers stole everything valuable and my hamster. How did we find out it was them? We built some secret base together in the forest next to our house a few days earlier. They brought everything there through a hole they cut into the fence. They left my hamster out in the forest for 2 days during fall.

Back to the main plot! My brother has always been a very intelligent but exhausting child and since working with some kid who was a diagnosed psychopath I think he could fall into the same spectrum. During our years with P he got very aggressive towards my mom. I remember him standing in front of her with an axe when he was about twelve years old. He ran away at one point and slept in a tent a few hundred meters away form our home.

So my brother, my mom and I moved into a flat and she divorced P. Life gotta get more chill from now on, right? Since we lost my dad doing stupid shit and mafia boss P it can only get better. 

I am in third grade at this point so I shoud be about 10 years old. 

Unfortunately the situation with my brother went downhill from here. He started not going to school, dealing drugs, breaking teachers noses and stuff like that. I remember him showing me a bag of white powder in the bathroom of a chinese restaurant when I was around thirteen years old. The police visited our flat a lot of times, doors were kicked in and I watched him beating my mom a lot of times. He had her cornered with a kitchen knife about two times and I was watching. I always admired my brother and I liked spending time with him even though he loved beating me up and chasing me with a kitchen knife when we were alone. And he respected me in a way that the fights never escalated fully with my mom while I was there. So every time I heard some noises (door getting slammed) I ran downstairs to check if they were fighting just to be there as a break (It took me some years to lose this habit after moving out). 

Fast forward some time the situation didn't get better. For my highschool french course I went to a one week exchange to Switzerland. I talked to my mom on one of the last days through the phone and I noticed something was off. The evening I get home my mother's current boyfriend fetches me and brings me to a hospital. So while I was away my brother has beaten up my mother so badly that I met her with a crushed nose, no teeth in her mouth, all bruised up and an almost fully purple face. My brother was forced out of the house by the police after that and my mom changed the locks.

Another quick side story: The boyfriend who picked me up on that day (K from now on) was kinda weird but I tried my best to accept him because I didn't want to make my mom's life harder than it was and I didn't want her to be lonely. One day I came home from school and my mom and K were fighting heavily. He had a bleeding nose and I heard them screaming insided the house while I was unlocking the door. So I did what I was always doing and watched them fight to prevent anything worse to happen. My mom fled into the living room he followed her and shut the door behind him. Suddenly I heard her screaming and rushed into the living room. They were on the couch K on top of my mom choking here. I started shouting and tried to pull him back from my mom. It somehow worked but I don't remember the situation from here on. But I told you K was somehow weird!

My brother lived a different life after he was kicked out which he barely talks about. He told me a story about him having the barrel of a gun pressed to his forehead. He is not able to sleep without a bat next to his bed and locks every day at night leaving the key in the lock. 

After some time my mom let him back in the house and the situation didn't get better. When I finished high school I did the only reasonable thing and enrolled in a university on the other side of the country which was the start of my party, drugs and alcohol phase which I left behind me a year ago.

I feel a lot better but a little bit drained so I won't describe the last 5 years in detail. But here are some of the most noteworthy stories:

The first time doing coke was with my dad in Amsterdam  
My best friend and roomate was a fixer which greeted me totally coked up in the kitchen while I was coming down from an acid trip (first time seeing a person shooting coke)  
My first therapy session was after a night of doing coke and snorting adderal with my dad. I started dissociating pretty bad while explaining to him why I need therapy  


This felt very good. Thanks for anyone bothering to read anything of this. I am always open to questions nothing is too private but things revealing my identity even though I don't really care if it happens.",01Jan2019,1

122,"I feel bad about how i have treated my brother, he's my best friend yet sometimes i feel like i take things out on him unfairly. Its been months since I've started an argument or screamed at him and that point was when i tried to quit smoking and it was a dumb argument. I'm improving and this is no longer a problem with us but i always feel bad thinking how i treated him. He may be younger but he's more mature than I am for putting up with me. I always strive to be the best role model for him and i hope he knows my love for him.",01Jan2019,1
