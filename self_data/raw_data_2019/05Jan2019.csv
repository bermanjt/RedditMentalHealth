1,"Hello, I'm new here on reddit, some of those billion posts really helped me on deep times, and in 2018 I finally decided to join the Redditor community :D

Anyway, let's go to the point;

With an life doubt, I like to help people, always, but sometimes, I get too much overloaded trying to be a good person, even If people say it, I still don't consider myself one (improving that too), so.. How can I be more imponet and decisive about what I'll do in life when I can for my own good and for the other people around me (It's like I dunno how to receive or give No as an answer cuz It might hurn the people's feelings..

Also sorry for my english, Brazilian here :v",05Jan2019,1

How I perceive it:

&amp;#x200B;

Example:  
There is two types of parents.

Parents A that expected their child to do the best on their exam while Parents B either doesn't care much if he pass or not.  
If a child turns out to fail an exam, Parents B accepts that their child couldn't do much or could simply care less.  
If a child turns out to fail an exam, Parents A however is seriously disappointed. Perhaps they will ground the child and make him/her study all day until his grade turns out to be good again.

But there is Parent C - The one that expected their child to pass the exam, but when the child fails, they could care less.",05Jan2019,1
13,"I was watching some old CoD Rage vids on YT, and was reminded of this one game I had on MW2. It's not entirely interesting but I just felt like sharing.           

It was on SkidRow. The map was basically 3 long-ish lanes with corridors that split the map in half or quarters or whatever. One dude was named XxMcStonerxX or something similar; back when Xx or Oo was cool to have in your username.         

He was a sniper in a ghillie suit, and he was owning us. It was like his team was unconsiously protecting him. I was a huge stoner back then, so I could tell this dude was stoned af and was in the zone. He could do no wrong, and his team was feeding off of that too. If we tried to rush him, he'd snipe us all down. If we tried to flank, his team would have his back. It was fairly infuriating. Which made our team try even harder to get to him, feeding him and his teammates kills.         

I had the brilliant idea to slow down and go through the tunnel. The tunnel is a sniper's haven. It's a long tunnel with a barrel and a cubby corner for cover, and that's it. At the end of the tunnel is a building with an upper floor with a window and a door and window facing the tunnel. Prime spot for a sniper to go back and forth between the floors, doors and windows, picking us off if we decided to go down the suicide tunnel. It was basically suicide because it was near impossible to predict where the sniper was going to be shooting from, and he just has to aim at a small area for an easy kill.            

Because of that, no one really used that tunnel. The enemy team would go back and forth, look down the tunnel, and then rotate to the other avenues. The main sniper dude was posted at the other 2 avenues, and his lackeys would look down the tunnel every so often and gun down any would-be flankers with ease. Occasionally the sniper would check too.             

I waited for my chance, and ran to the barrel. An enemy would come by, look down the tunnel, and run off. As soon as I could, I ran to the corner and hid. Again, the enemy came by, looked around and then ran off. I took the opportunity to run into the building. Again, the lackey came by and ran off when it was clear. I went to the top floor and waited for their god like sniper. I shot him in the back and picked off 1 or 2 lackeys before getting gunned down.          

The entire tide of the battle shifted. My team broke through one of the avenues, and took over that side of the map while the sniper was struggling to get back into his groove. It's like they realized the unkillable sniper was merely a man and not some untouchable killing machine. The enemy team ended up spawning on the our side of the map and we took over their side. Slowly but surely, reclaimed their original side. We just couldn't hold them off like they did.            

I did this 2 or 3 times until the game ended. One of my more prouder CoD moments.                

The memory is still stuck in my head because of how it was like every player in the game was reacting to this stoned sniper. it's was like he cast a spell on everyone; his team would protect him, and our team would rage and feed him kills out of frustration. It was like he was in control of everything, and I was the only one who saw how to break this spell. It doesn't sound all that interesting, but believe me, it was bizarre. One of those ""you had to be there"" type things I guess.                

Well, thanks for reading my dumb reminiscence of a video game, I hope you enjoyed.",05Jan2019,1
14,"Alright, before I begin I just want to say, I’m not here to bash anybody. I just want to have answers and perspectives on this situation, because I genuinely need it.
So, I was on YouTube, (during my atheistic phase) and watched a couple of videos debunking theism, as usual. I made a comment saying how I’ve lost my dad while being an atheist and he was a Jehovah’s Witness and how’s it’s been a struggle for me ever since. Then this person responded to my comment and gave me his Discord. On that platform, we seemed to click. I asked if he had an iPhone (my preferred media of texting) and he said and I asked for his phone number, which he gave. Since I have an iPhone and an iPad, we talked on my iPad then in my phone. I messaged him everyday, for two days I believe, so I could get to know him better. We talked and we both had a lot in common, both liberal, gun control advocates, ect and our interest in sci fi. He even recommended that I watch this one anime, that I had completely forgotten about, and it had time travel and futurism. A couple of weeks later, my text messages on iMessage were turning green, I didn’t think much of it, because I also was texting someone and they turned green as well, but that was because they had a different phone contract. So I thought, maybe he’s busy with school. I texted him saying “hey” and “Heyyo” but I got no response. No responses were fine by me because he had school and moved up to high school and skipped 8th grade because of his high GPA. So I texted him, about once a month, but during October like twice a month. Then, I went onto discord and messaged him. He said, “ Do you not get it? I blocked you for a reason. Go away.” And I said “why? What did I do? Could you give me a reason?” He replied,” you’re dumb and annoying. There’s your reason, now leave me alone.” I answered, “ how about you actually prove to me how I’m dumb and annoying?” He then responded,” my girlfriends controlling what I say” he then showed me a screenshot from her girlfriend saying that he should tell me that I’m dumb and annoying.( so basically, she’s telling him to insult me, controlling right?) so he said that all three of us were going to y’all. His girfriend( I’ll name Ally) was being a cunt... to say the least. I told her that he can talk to whoever he pleases, and she said ,” excuse me?” And I replied you know what I said. Then Ally proceeded to call me a bitch and I told her she was childish. As more bickering started to come from her mouth, Jonah (the one I talked to and got no response for months) said I’m sorry princess, but I have to choose my princess over you. And I thought aww that’s sweet, he’s basically saying he’s choosing me (m names princess) over his gf but I soon came to realize that that wasn’t the case. He blocked me and chose his girlfriend. I felt like crying, I was really hurt, but then I thought, no, I have to know. I couldn’t just leave him with his abusive girlfriend like that! He’s a lot stronger than he thinks, and he was so scared of her. So I made another account called Allis so I could message him. He accepted my friend request and I told him my name is Allis and I got his discord from someone else. But then I told him I loved him, platonically, and that I want the best for him. I told him that what he did yesterday really hurt me and I almost hated him for it. But I told him I stilled cared about him. He replied,” so you lied to me?” And I said no, I faked it. And then  he said that no you wouldn’t, you would’ve told the truth if you really cared. I thought if I said it from the start then you would’ve blocked me from the start, eliminating my chance to explain myself. I replied, yes I do, why do you think I made this account? He then responded ,” to stalk me. I replied I didn’t stalk you, I came here to compromise, maybe compromise isn’t the best word, but I still want to talk to you. He then said, that’s awfully selfish of you. Don’t you think.
I told him that he gutted me and apologized for not talking as often as I should, because I’ve been through so much lately. He then said I’m sure you have. I thanked him for understanding.
I then proceeded to tell him that I have to go back to school which I’ll die because it takes a toll on me. He then said that I was trying to guilt trip him and I told him I wasn’t trying to scare him. I thought, I’m just trying to let you know how important you were. He then said, Alyssa was right, you really are desperate for any guys attention. Then I responded, nope, I just like talking to guys that I care about deeply, and that means you! He then asked why do you care about me, to then I said because you’re my friend. You’re smart funny and cool. He then said do you not get this. I showed him the text messages of him saying he considers me as his friend, to which he said he pitied me, then I began to question if his girlfriend is controlling him again- which he said she wasn’t. He asked if I wanted the truth and I said yes. He admitted that the girl from yesterday wasn’t his girlfriend. She was his best friend. And he said he was complaining to her about me messaging him. He was debating whether or not to block me. He decided not to. Then they had some fun. She pretended to be my psycho girlfriend. He said that was the truth behind last night. He said, and I quote”, and what can I say, fucking with you was some very good entertainment.” I was dumbfounded. I kept saying hey and Heyyo to him like once a month. I never knew that bugged him. He said yes, you annoyed me. So quite saying we’re friends. I proceeded to apologize deeply for it. He then stated that talking to me was a chore, which broke me the fuck down. I absolutely hate being clingy, and seeing that just hurt me. I said he could’ve just told me to quiet down a little and that I would stop messaging him less. He told me then I still didn’t get it and I replied I did. He said you aren’t going to message me less and you aren’t going to message me at all. I don’t want to talk to you. I said, I guess you’re an ass then. He replied maybe to you to which I responded no in general. He told me to hate him but I couldn’t because I still cared. He told me to go talk to people who want to talk to me and said that it’s not like I led you on. Like he had the nerves to say that. I said that he did lead me on. I also told him that he could’ve told me to message him less and that I thought he had a different phone contract or some shit. He said he blocked me, Normal people would realize that. I said well I’ve never been blocked before. He said I’m asking you to stop talking to me, u derstand. And I said yes, duhh, he replied well we shouldn’t have an issue with it. My final words were, I’m always here ok? To which he responded, oh I know, I won’t be here, see ya. I said see ya...

15,"I’m absolutely apathetic and wounded from high school. I’m a 14 year old freshman and I absolutely hate it. All, well, most of the teachers cannot TEACH FOR SHIT. They just hand out packets and expect everyone to just learn from it. I’ve had to switch my schedule more than three times because of how the teachers taught, and now I’m stuck in college prep when I was supposed to be in AP. I guess it’s my fault but is it? I was even hospitalized for the second time in September because I couldn’t handle it. If I go back there, I might die emotionally, psychologically and possibly physically (suicide).

17,"Mother of 3 here, will refer to children as numbers. Child 3 is the one I hate. 3 is not my bio child, lived with us for 7 years now, bio parents are drug addicts. I know I’m going to get a lot of grief for this and I know I deserve it, I hate myself for hating him. 3 is ALWAYS doing something to get into trouble. 1 &amp; 2 are by no means perfect! And I do not wear blinders to that! However, they are very different from 3. If 3 has to put forth any effort 3 would rather just ask someone else to do it. We have had the same house rules since the day 3 came to live with us at 2yrs old, we (mostly me but my husband respects my want) keep a quiet home, we don’t slam doors, cabinets, drawers, scream or throw things in the home, being outside is for loud and being inside is calm and peaceful. All of which 3 gets in trouble for multiple times a day, the kids are free to be outside anytime as long as chores and homework are done. We have 30 acres and a million things to do outdoors. 3 runs in the house, refuses to put things away after using them, undresses in the game room and shoves clothes in the couch instead of a dirty clothes basket, if 3 misplaces something its NEVER 3’s fault and there is zero remorse if 3 ruins something that belongs to someone else. We got 3 an Xbox One a couple months ago for good behavior (3 told the truth in a very hard situation that involved 3’s bio parents) so now we have 3 Xbox’s in the game room and 3 has already broken 4 controllers because 3 WILL NOT leave the remote in the game room, it goes to the bathroom, kitchen, out front, anywhere 3 goes. If 3 breaks the remote from dropping it on the tile 50 times 3 will just secretly take someone else’s and nobody will know until the controller is used again to find out it’s broken. 3 lies all the time, even though I try to reward 3 when 3 is honest, 3 manipulates, will try to pit my husband and I against each other if 3 doesn’t like the answer one of us gives. There is a never ending list of ways 3 disrupts things. 3 is not without good qualities but they are over shadowed. 

I have tried so hard to like 3 but it is exhausting! And I resent 3. 3 requires SO MUCH extra attention that I have no time to give to 1 &amp; 2. I feel like 3 has just destroyed the peaceful happy life we once had. 1, 2 &amp; 3 all get along like typical siblings but sometimes it does come to surface that 1 &amp; 2 feel slighted because everything is always about 3. I wish I could just give 3 back to the bio parents, I know it’s not an option because it would be the equivalent of sending a child to the lions den but I fantasize about it all the time. Am I the only person struggling with something like this? I don’t know what to do. I wonder if I can really do this for the rest of my life. 

Sorry it’s so long, I’ve been dying to get this off my chest. ",05Jan2019,1
18,"When people die, you don’t get beautiful last words. They don’t wait for you to arrive so they can spend their last breath with you. Sometimes the people you love die in horrifying pain due to a hospice error and it destroys your family, and traumatizes your siblings. Hollywood doesn’t show how sometimes you don’t get to cry at the funeral because your estranged relatives fight each other and mortify your whole family. After the relatives leave and the loved one is buried, things don’t go back to normal because what is normal?

Hollywood doesn’t show how confusing Life Insurance Claims and Tax Annuities are, or how weird it feels to throw out your loved one’s leftover food. Hollywood doesn’t show that sometimes three other loved one’s die, back-to-back, immediately following the funeral and how it feels to not care at this point. Hollywood shows the tears, but what about the emptiness that is so crushing I can’t even get out of bed most mornings? I’d like to see a movie about that, or at least an instruction manual.

Today I finally got to see one of my friends after having not seen much of anyone, it felt so surreal. I'm usually not the one for going crazy with my friends, so it was a pleasant surprise. The problem is that it feels like I'm growing disconnected from the people I'm supposed to be close with. I guess it's partially my fault for not striking up text messages to them in hopes of getting together or to talk. The more I write this the more I realize it might be my fault for everything. I've just been so lonely, even when I have the respect of everyone around me. It doesn't make sense. I try to keep more to myself since I hate being the center of attention (yes I'm shy, that's why I'm here), but I still get around with everyone.

23,"I thought about this today after a long evening of trying to get her to stop climbing on the TV stand and knocking all of my housemate's Gamecube games off the shelf underneath. She recognizes the voice I use when I want her to get down from some piece of furniture, and usually lets out a ""you're fucking lame"" type meow before jumping to the floor. 

She's almost a year old and I can tell that maybe I don't play with her enough to expel all her energy. I used to play with her for an hour or two after work but she'd still be just as jumpy regardless, so maybe I thought that's not what she needs. 

Maybe it's because I'm in a slump right now, but I hope she doesn't resent me for yelling at her, or for not playing with her as much as I used to. I hope in her cat brain she isn't pissed at me and  thinking that I'm being unfair to her. 

I know she's just a cat but the fact that she can't tell me if something is distressing her bothers me and I told her several times just a few moments ago that I love her and that I hope she can somehow make sense of it when I say it. ",05Jan2019,1

27,"I have a lot of crazy dreams, and I love all of them that I can remember.

Except...I don't know what they mean. There are a lot of common themes in my dreams, from me mostly being the hero, to witches, to crazy man eating monster females. Weird. And a lot of videogames.

Anyway, I might as well post stuff about my dreams here, right? Unless there's a better place for this. (Please tell me if there is)

So, first dream:

So I'm at some sort of carnival or festival type thing, with two of my irl friends. One of them goes of to the bathroom, so we chill and go do some stuff. Then we realize she'd been gone for awhile, so went back to check up on her. (Please note: this friend has depression and self harms)

For some odd reason, we were at the bathrooms at school. My other friend went in ahead of me, and she didn't come out, so I went in to see what was wrong.

There were a bunch of girls in there standing around and talking. I could tell that something was off about them. I can't remember too well, but I think at some point their eyes were one solid color, maybe black or white. Something freaky.

Something was terribly wrong, so I tried to talk to them. I remember trying not to look panicked and knowing that I couldn't leave. After all, my friends weren't there at all. Again, playing the hero. Eventually I realized they were cannibals, or something like that, except they weren't human. They were acting all weird, being all friendly and trying to invite me to their house. For some odd reason, I accepted. (Crazy, right)

Their house seemed pretty normal. But now, the girls looked different. Faces kindof stretched and huge, eyes bigger, like puppets or dolls. One of them stirred soup and said something about me staying for dinner.

Then it switches to my one friend, the one who went with me to check on my other friend. She was trying to escape, jumping on buildings and up fences. Then there's something strange. There's some superheroes looking down on the scene. Ironman, captain america, and black widow and a few others.

Thats all I can remember, except perhaps some more morphing of the monsters and me trying to talk them into releasing my friend. I'm pretty sure they figured out at some point that I knew they were trying to eat me.

Oh yeah, another thing, but I'm not sure when it appeared. A giant pot, or a hole, filled with mutilated bodies swirling and crying out.

Pretty freaky but I liked it lol.

Can somebody help me figure out what it means?

Another night alone in bed, 
I toss and turn, I feel so restless, and
I’m on social media again

Friends are hanging out without me
Someone’s on a trip with family
I want to like it but I can’t 
My phone is heavy in my hands,
But I’m on social media again

Mundane
Things happen to me,
The same shit all over again
These thoughts in my brain 
They keep me awake 
So I just keep on scrolling

Maybe I’m a person with nothing but hate
But maybe I’m, just jealous of everyone else 
The world is changing fast, I
Just can’t keep up the pace, I’m
Getting left behind again 

Oh, every single post seems to let me know, 
Just how good they have it 
When I’m feeling low, I just overdose
On everybody’s happiness

But why’s it hard to find my own?
By the time I come across it, it’s gone
Don’t wanna go anywhere but home,
It feels easier when I’m alone

Mundane, mundane
Things happen to me,
The same shit all over again
These thoughts in my brain
They keep me awake
So I just keep on scrolling
To waste some time, to empty my mind
I scroll through my phone now

Lonely, lonely, so lonely
The only one there for me is me
No way, no way 
No one understands
Every story they share makes it clear

Photos of me
I wish they were real
The happiness I show to all (All a lie)
In front of the lens (I’m empty)
Completely someone else

35,"Internet said getting this shit out on paper somewhere would help. This isn’t exactly paper but I don’t even want to put up with my own chicken scratches right now. Fuck it, internet always knows best right? 

I haven’t been able to sleep lately. I’ve been wanting to tell myself it’s normal, I’ve been this way for as long as I can remember. It was never this bad though. Lay in bed awake at night for hours, tossing and turning as if my bed were made of hot coals or something, sure, but never like this. Even then my sleep deprivation would catch up to me the next day and I’d end up asleep until the sun had gone back down. I know because my lady would yell at me for it. Funny, right? One problem solved and another added. So what is it about me now that’s making it worse? My eyes feel heavy but even when I close them myself and lay back with my phone thrown across the room in frustration they snap back open. A minute feels like an hour trying to get myself to sleep, but I swear I get out of bed to grab my phone and the rest of that hour just snaps back into place. 

I’m restless. Not the kind of restless where my dumb ass would watch scary videos on YouTube and I’d end up too frightened to close my eyes. That I could tolerate. Now I’m just restless. A million thoughts running through my head so fast and none stick. Just bouncing back and forth between each thing. The relationship. The job. The education. The weight loss. Right back to the relationship and onwards. Sometimes I think I manage to fall asleep but I don’t feel rested. I’ve taken to calling it micro sleeping but I’ve no idea if that’s what I’m doing. It feels like I can vividly remember staring at the pitch black emptiness of my room for 15 minutes at a time before going back to my restless thoughts. Back and forth for hours until the sun is shining through my window and I snap back into consciousness and go about my dad as normal. 

What the hell did I even do today? I went in to Taco Bell for almost 4 hours today. That’s all. If I only slept three hours from 3-6AMish and went in from 11-3PM where did the rest of my day go?

I haven’t been able to stomach gaming for long sessions like I used to just a year ago in forever.

37,"I hate my meaningless job, my SO prioritises binge watching shows and listening to podcasts over having conversations with me and when I try to talk about my interests or feelings it’s “too intense”. I recently realised that if I was in a relationship with my best friend, that I’d have to break up with them because all the effort is on my part. I don’t enjoy my hobbies and I’ve lost the fire and passion for the things that used to make me happy. My mind is undisciplined and my peripheral “friends” seem to only care about me when they need my help with their projects. I have no meaningful connections and nobody needs me, except for my pets - I guess. I feel so worthless and miserable and invisible and forgotten and the worst part is that I keep reading and being told that it’s all in my control, but I can’t see a way to change my path. I spend too much time in my own head - I literally can’t see the point of existing for trying to find it. When I find a way to change it’s too difficult and too challenging and I talk myself into defeat without even trying. 
I try to contact people to connect with but as I mentioned I don’t really have anyone to connect with other than fair weather friends and I don’t know how to start fresh and make new friends. I have trust issues and I’m an introvert.

38,"Just want to start by noting that I’m no expert on this subject. All I have is my experiences.  14 years of depression due to a poor understanding of reality. Because nobody knew I needed extra attention, I never got it. I was seriously misguided and nobody knew it. I didn’t even know it until I got old enough to comprehend this kind of stuff at that point I took the steps I needed to to get better and that’s where I am today, still strolling along... a lot easier now that I’m 24 going on 25.  Anyway I probably missed a lot of points but here it is...

So what feels like a very long time ago but in reality was still within a generation of where we are today, was the Great War and World War II. After this we experienced what was named the Great Depression if I recall correctly. This was where everybody mourned their losses. To this day those effects are still being felt and this what I think has happened. 
So obviously there were a tremendous amount of casualties from both wars and some may see a bit of the Darwin theory here others may see beyond that. Either way we lost a lot of bright minded people. Mainly being adult males, the ones at the time responsible for keeping society running with the jobs they were in. (Sorry ladies it’s just how it was back then, you have credit elsewhere though). With such a loss to the foundations of society, those that survived were left to try and work out how to keep things running. I’ll be honest when I understand the enormity of the situation, the remaining population of woman, children, elderly and survivors of the war did an amazing job to get us where we are today. Throughout this time we saw things like woman’s rights come to existence. This was because the woman of society had finally been given a chance to prove they are equal beings. And it worked, slowly. Now today woman have every privilege men do, on paper... there’s still a few of the older more closed minded generation hidden amongst society causing an imbalance. It takes a long time to get rid of stubbornness, wether it’s a person or a mindset. 
But there’s been another problem that we haven’t quite worked out yet and it’s referred to as the Baby Boomer Generation. A generation that’s main goal was breeding. This meant there was a huge increase in the need for teachers and caregivers. With such a demand standards were dropped or set too low to begin with. A lot of people that shouldn’t be in the jobs they are in, got put into those jobs. This is where I experienced this personally. I went through a schooling system that had unrealistic standards because of years of people not quite knowing how to handle the society the previous generation had salvaged. The ideas were developed but the people teaching them didn’t even understand it properly. In my terms it was the subject of mental health that was seriously neglected. Now we are seeing a forever increasing number of youths commuting suicide or being diagnosed with depression. Here we see stubbornness again. Denying the evidence that youths are being neglected and spoilt by lazy parents and teachers.  These people are selfish, greedy, power hungry beings with no empathy or aspirations beyond their own profit, is what you’d expect to hear, but in reality they just don’t know any better so I don’t blame them completely. They have taken root in our society and only today are we starting to uproot them as the next generation of realists and over-privileged kids are coming of age and making the changes they and only a few from other generations can see we need. We are progressing and I’m happy about the direction we are going, just not the time it’s taking. ",05Jan2019,1

Hello, I’m 31, I am a native resident of France and a close friend of mine suggested that I use reddit to get some advice on an issue I am having.  He said that reddit is an incredible place where many people share experiences and have often helped each other in crazy circumstances, so I am giving this a try…..

For the last 10+ years I have worked for a very large company in France that I am having many issues with.  I have been a very hard worker but my body has been breaking down due to a rare disease I have, which has been diagnosed 6 years ago. This means I have to take medication every hour of the day, even during the night.  This leaves me with a lot of physical pain that eventually leads to me having episodes of passing out and being hospitalised.  
When my disease was diagnosed, I moved out next to the sea because doctors were telling me I would feel a big difference with my symptoms (humidity in the air, less pollution..)
And I did, I was being hospitalised less often after that.
But the distance from my work was bigger, now it’s taking 4h30 combined daily commute to go to work, I wake up at 4am, and go back home at 8pm.
I requested to my employer to be transferred to a closer place to where I live (I could be transferred in the same town), but they’re not making the effort saying it’s complicated.

Recently my mother died of lung cancer, leaving me with the sole burden of her estate, funeral and guardian of my 17 year old sister. At this time, many other unfortunate events happened at the same time that have also contributed to my health now being in a very bad place. 
For example my partner decided to leave and the financial burden of paying for our house by myself. It’s been a very hard few months….  
Just to put into context what happens with how bad my health is, the last time I passed out I was cycling and had a head trauma among other things……  

I was working half time during the past year (disability, order from the doctor from my work) until last October. 
Then, an expert decided that I was able to work full time again.
Of course I contested the decision (I’ve sent a letter as a proof, it can take months before I get an answer).
All of the specialists that I see were shocked when I told them.
The thing is, what the expert based his decision on, was a wrong previous diagnosis. 
I was not aware of that. Then I knew that the « title » of my disability was wrong, because at that time, the doctors had not found the diagnosis of my disease yet, so the doctor from my work decided to put something else (kind of defining a depression).

The tricky part is coming. 
They added my disease to the motive of my disability, keeping the depression as well.
Now that an expert said I was able to work full time again, if my doctor is writing me a certificate saying I can’t work, it has to be for a different reason that the previous motives, or new elements that happened. So it can’t be either for the many symptoms of my disease, either the depression, since the expert said despite my disease I was able to work full time (he was barely aware of what was my disease exactly).
The thing is, there are new elements. 

I lost my mother, I’m taking care of my sister, who is very bad at the moment. She is hurting herself, she’s attacking me verbally and physically, and she does it on the dog when I’m not there. She’s seeing a psychiatrist. I have to constantly keep an eye on her.
I’m all alone, no family left helping. 
I’m trying to find a new place, smaller and cheaper, I’m spending every minute of my time and my energy on her, my dog, the responsibilities, I don’t even have time for myself to do my mourning.

When my doctor wrote I couldn’t go working because of anxiety and depression, the doctor from my work refused it, saying it’s the same motive that before, and since the expert said that despite that I was able to work full time, they won’t accept it.
So my work was not paying me whilst I was not going to work, putting me in a difficult financial situation.
I was simply choosing to not go feeling I could faint at any moment. And I can’t be hospitalised right now, because I have a teenager at home I need to take care of.

What makes it difficult for me at work, are the heat, the air conditioning, no windows at all, and the pollution being in a big city, all of this is making it very hard to breath for me, my health is just deteriorating. 

I think they are waiting for me to quit, which would be the easiest way for it to stop.
Except that I don’t want to let them win, and I can’t have the luxury of not having a job right now...

As I said my doctor writes me notes and supports me as he knows that my situation is quite severe.  The doctors from the company have implied that they have to declare to their bosses formally that I am capable of full time work otherwise they will face their own severe repercussions.  Various people at the company have tried to help me make a transition to a job location closer to where I live and to be part time, but the company are insisting on doing everything they can to force me to quit.  For anyone who understands employment law in France this is all very evil of late.  I have worked there for more than 10 years and have been very consistent and loyal.
But I now feel that I have no other choice but to either quit (which would leave me in the worst financial situation now that I have to be the legal guardian of my sister and pay for the house I am trying to move out of but can’t get another if I don’t have a job) or that I take some kind of legal action…...  

I will stop here because this is already quite lengthy.  Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.  I am an open book so I will answer any and all questions people might have without getting into further trouble with my employer.  My union and doctor are involved but at every turn it feels like I am powerless to find a way through this.  

Thank you for your consideration, any help is very much appreciated.

Many Thanks

41,"At first, I saw my mother feeding my 1 month old niece and I think I saw my mother holding a solid food which I doubt that what my eyes saw is true, but then I had a second thought again that what if what I saw is true and it's really my mother feeding my niece solid food which I think is not supposed to be fed, which give me another thing to worry about which is if my niece would have some problems after eating solid at such a young age. Remember, at first I doubt if all I saw is true or not. 

Then, somehow after that, I thought about how much milk I drank and is it too much because I just brought the milk in the morning and now it's in the evening already with a little bit left, the milk I brought today is around 2 liters and I started thinking if my intake is normal. After thinking about my milk intake, I started thinking about my body shape again and I think about how much I should eat and what do people think about my body shape and then I thought about exercising but then I thought that it's so hard to start exercising, but then also I want to look good, but I just want to feel good about myself no matter what my body shape is.

I just want to stop worrying about things so much, I feel like I just think about things on the negative side too much, but I don't know how to change the way I think.

49,"I met him on an online game last year. I'm not a gamer, but I was severely depressed and needed to get my mind off the traumatic events I had gone through. We were drawn to each other very quickly and became friends who talked outside of the game on a regular basis. The more we got to know each other the more I found myself falling for him. We confessed our feelings for one another a few months into our friendship, then it just became crazy intense. We couldn't get enough of each other. We talked every single day, from morning till night for 7 months. We became exclusive during this time. 

We had our close knit group of friends who we kept in touch with regularly outside of the game, on a messaging app. Only a few knew about me and him being more than friends, and we wanted to keep it that way. We're both private people, neither of us even has a social media account. So very few knew about our relationship and how crazy we were for each other. We were planning on meeting up and surprising our mutual friends by sending a picture of us together in the group chat. 

We talked about meeting for months. He was going to get a business trip out of the way first, then he was to fly to my city to meet on the 13th of this month...

He got on the plane on the night of December 23rd. It was a week long business trip to East Asia, and since it was such a long flight he decided to add 3 extra days of leisure. He'd been working so hard, and he had just lost his father the month before, so he really needed this break and I was happy for him. He said he would send vacation pictures, he was being his usual sweet self, I asked him to let me know when his plane landed, he said will do, then we said our goodbyes and exchanged I love you's.

That was the last I heard from him. It's been two weeks.

I don't know what to do with myself. Nobody has heard from him, everybody was worried about him. But one by one they all started to lose hope. All messages sent to him by all our friends, not one message has been read. I tried calling a million times, his phone is just off. I looked through news articles to see if there were any plane crashes, or any tourist deaths in X country, I searched his name, and came up with nothing. No news. No word. Just radio silence.

I haven't eaten in three days. I haven't been able to sleep properly. I keep waking up in cold sweats and checking my phone only to see no notifications. I muted everyone but him and deleted the game because I just don't fucking care anymore. All I care about his hearing from my sweet love. All I want is to know he's okay. I cannot rest until I know what's going on.

Everyone thinks he just ghosted us and is never coming back. But they don't know him like I do. They don't know he would never do something so cruel to me. We were each other's everything. He told me every day that I make everything better. I just want him to come back and make this nightmare stop.

I can't do anything but cry. I'm exhausted. I'm confused. I don't understand. I don't understand why it's been 2 weeks and he just won't fucking reach out. I don't know if he's even alive anymore. He should have found a way to let me know he's okay by now. He should have been back home by now.

He made me want to wake up every morning. He made me want to live again. Ever since he's been gone there's been nothing but pain and fear and darkness. I don't know much longer I can go on. Every day I don't hear from him I'm losing hope. I'm starting to believe he won't come back. I don't know how to move on or what the fuck to do. I don't want to believe he ghosted me without any explanation or warning. He knows I have mental illnesses, he would *never ever* do this to me.

in late february though, i had this really simple dream. 

it was summer, i was downtown in my beloved city, and there was a parade and merriment going on. my friends, most of whom live all over the country/world, were there. i was eating sunflower seeds and enjoying the warmth of the sun. my dog was there too and he was off-leash, and unlike most dreams where my dogs are off their leashes, i was't worried about that at all. 

and when it was time to go home, i ran down the streets with him beside me, and running felt so much like flying across the ground that i spread out my arms and went ""NYEEOWWWWwww"" like an airplane.

it was so vivid. it was the most cliche happy-dream ever, and it was the first good dream i'd had in months. it put me in a good mood for just one day, and for some reason, right after that, things started looking up for me. i finally stopped feeling so hopeless and remembered how to look on the bright side of things. i was looking forward to the spring, i was making efforts to hang out with my friends, and i started keeping my head up. and eventually, the circumstances i was in themselves started improving too. 

i keep wondering whether it was the dream that caused my mind to start righting itself again, or if- probably more likely- the dream was the big glowing sign that was my mind telling me ""hey! i'm righting myself again! we're going to be okay!"" but i don't think i'm going to forget that dream for a long time. it was like a gift.",05Jan2019,1

I knew this would be an obstacle for me because I have terrible gym anxiety. Last time I joined was when I was 17, and after two visits I saw someone I knew and never went back. I was too embarrassed to cancel in person so I cancelled my debit card that I paid with monthly. 

All I have to do to rejoin is pay $50 which I owe, and then I’m able to go. My general anxiety is mostly non-existent now, but certain situations like this still get to me.

Them were L and M. I didn't recognize them at first and they could say the same about me. After the realization hit us I felt something i hadn't felt in a long time. It was joy. L and M were friends from elementary school, I hadn't seen them in years.

The evening turned out to be one of the best I had in weeks. We were constantly talking, joking and laughing. Talking about old times and things we did back then. It felt great. It felt like I had finally found somebody like me, people I could call friends.

The evening came to an end and we decided to stay in contact. L asked for my phone number and said he would pass it to M, and that they would text me soon so we could meet up again.
I came home that evening, filled with joy, expecting one of them to text me in the following days.

Well, and here we are. 3 months later and nothing. No call or text, no sign of someone trying to contact me.

This is the point where I ask myself: What did I do wrong? Why did they make false promises, knowing it would shove me deeper in my isolated hole? Why did they act like they would like me just to disappoint me? Where is my fault, what should I have done differently? ",05Jan2019,1

63,"I live in an area with not much to do, and it’s really hard to meet new people too because of that. I see all these people on social media (which is my first problem, I need to take a break from social media but I feel like I’m legit addicted) and they have a good time. However, if I think about them and what they are doing, and place myself in their shoes, I feel as though I would still be sad. I wouldn’t be living in the moment, I would be worrying that whole time about what other people are doing and what I’m missing out on. I really like to think that having a gf or being some sort of relationship would help me not have that feeling. However, that’s false. Perhaps it’s time for therapy. These feelings may be more internal than I could imagine.",05Jan2019,1
