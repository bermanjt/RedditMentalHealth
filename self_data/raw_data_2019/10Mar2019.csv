5,"I've known my friend for around a year and a half. Around last February I realized I had feelings for her, but I kept to myself because I knew they weren't mutual. 

&amp;#x200B;

This morning I asked if I could talk to her at some point, but I wasn't really prepared to confess. While talking I tried to avoid it, saying as minimal as possible until she knew I wasn't saying something and said something along the lines of ""it's not hard, just say it."" All I could respond with was ""it's not easy to tell someone you like them."" She already had her suspicions, and it was obviously she still did not feel the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

After that I was just lying in bed, heart racing, and unsure of what I should be feeling. I expected things to go really downhill, maybe never having the chance to talk to her again, but that doesn't seem to be the case. For the rest of the afternoon I wasn't sure why, but I wasn't overly sad (I actually was able to enjoy most of my day). It's kind of like I was set free of something that has been dragging me down for the past year.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been about 8 hours since then and that feeling is slowly disappearing. I'm not sure if I just need to rest for the night or maybe just avoid messaging/seeing her for the next day or so. This is a weird feeling that I've never experienced prior.

I don't know if I'm sad, relieved, happy, regretful...",10Mar2019,3
6,"There comes a point where you just can’t take it anymore. And by “it” I mean feeling like a piece of shit. You grow up and have an awesome family. But you’re fat. Which isn’t a problem with your family, but with everyone else. And yet it doesn’t matter, because you don’t care about what other people think. You’ve got your own problems and for privacy reasons stuff I won’t get into but it’s stuff that causes you great stress. But who cares? Because at the end of the day your family is awesome. Well you go through the first years of your life not knowing a lot because, hey, your only a couple years old. But you know that some people make fun of you because that’s just what kids do. It doesn’t hurt now because you don’t care. You don’t let small things get to you. You then have to move. Go to another place and make new friends. No way to communicate with your friends from your previous home because you’re too young. But you don’t care because your family is awesome and your very social. You can make friends with anyone. But you see the kicker is, is that everyone isn’t like you. They see a kid that’s fat and have this bias, for absolutely no reason. I digress. You get to this new school and make new friends. Of course there will be bullies. But who cares? You spend a couple years here and then you’re gonna move again. Right before you leave, your friends then turn into bullies and shit on you for no reason. But it makes sense because you’re leaving elementary school and now there is this thing called “being cool”. So you leave and head to a new place with a new school. Have to make new friends. Do that, but at the same time, get shit on by a person. Just one for right now. But what’s this? This person has this desire to make you the most hated person in the school? Well it works! She twists situations that you’re both in to make you look like the bad guy. So now you’re the laughing stock of the school because you’re fat and annoying. But really you’re very reserved but because of this one person, you are the worst. This person then gets you in trouble with a teacher. Then you get in trouble at home. Have very few friends. Then you summer comes. And you start doing this thing you love a lot. This thing is a sport. You do this sport and become very good at said sport. You lose a little weight. Then you go back to school and gain a group of friends. Good friends. The upcoming year will be the best year of your life so far. You’re excited. You have a lot of fun. Develop your first real crush. Find your first real best friend. Life is good. Summer comes again. Exciting summer. You love playing this sport. Oh wait. You can’t play the sport anymore. Oh no. Go back to school. Start to gain weight. Still have the group of friends and have an awesome time. Then halfway through the year, you lose your best friend. Not lose them but they aren’t so close anymore. So you don’t get to see them. Bummer! Then you’re group of friends starts to get smaller and smaller. Summer comes. Oops! More weight gain. Uh oh! High school! Group of friends completely disintegrates. Maybe it’s because you can’t contact any of them because you have very conservative parents. Who knows? The group of friends are no more. It’s sorta like you have to make a whole new group of friends. Which you do. But then, a person in that group of friends, who holds a lot of power because they are liked a lot, decides they don’t like you anymore. So you start to get made fun of. Then that group of friends is no more. You were exiled from the group. Oh no! Oh well. You’re alone but hey, you start playing the sport again. But you still gain weight. It’s really weird! Fast forward a little bit of time, same year, Uh Oh! You can’t play the sport again, which you are realizing is your one true passion. You get sad, but your best friend is there on the video game system to talk to you and cheer you up. But, since your best friend is in high school, they change as well! Just like everyone in your old group of friends. Everyone changed. Except you. But that’s for later. So you and your best friend are no longer friends, for now, because they are an asshole. Summer comes. You gain weight. But hey, you can play the sport again. The next year of school rolls around and you are playing the sport again. Woohoo! Still don’t have friends. But it has been a while since I’ve mentioned your family is still really cool. Well you continue to play the sport and play it for a long time. School goes on. You get bullied. Don’t have a lot of friends. But who cares? Summer comes. Uh oh! You can’t play the sport again. Gain more weight. Now the sport team that you were on no longer plays. Guess it’s time to do a different sport. One that you have never played before. Gain more weight. Play different sport. School starts again. You and your best friend reconnect but it isn’t too soon after that that your best friend truly becomes a horrible human being so you decided to break it off for good. Oh well! Now you start up school and you are playing this new sport. Since you’ve never played it before, you suck at it. But you keep trying. Now there’s new bullies. Mostly the same ones but now there are ones added on because of the new sport. Uh oh! But that’s ok. You’re family is pretty cool. You are forced to go through months of this sport you’ve never played before. And even though the team is very bad, the coach never puts you in. Even at the last game. Oh well! You wasted a couple of months but who cares? Then some more months past and you’re just about to play your favorite sport when a part of you breaks! Uh oh! Major life style change. Gain a lot of weight. You are now the fattest you’ve ever been! That stinks. But you go on. Daily bullying. Who cares? After the broken part of you isn’t broken anymore, you start to get back into shape. Lose weight. But you still eat like a fat pig. Maintain weight. Summer comes. Realize that you’re really fat. Decide to grow a security blanket. Make a life changing decision. Eat healthy. Exercise. Go back to school. Exercise. Eat healthy. Get your first girlfriend. girlfriend has problems. Want to help girlfriend. Get shit on by girlfriend. All of this happens in a matter of days. Get upset. Then get motivated. Keep exercising. Lose 50 pounds. Wow. Start weight training. It is now today. We are in the present as I am writing this reddit post. Feel bad. But realize that you will feel better tomorrow. But that doesn’t change how you feel now. You’ve got a lot of shit on your plate. On top of that you’re trying to work out. It’s hard. You remember how you felt when you had friends. When people like you. You felt good. You want to feel good again because it’s hard. You’ve lost all this weight, but you realize, you still have a long ass road ahead. It’s fucking depressing. You’ve been bullied your entire life for being fat. You now are a little overweight and a lot better then you were. But you still feel like you’re fat. You’re in way better shape. You want to look good. You want to feel good. So you decide to make another change. You get rid of the security blanket. As your slowly getting rid of the security blanket, you lose confidence. As you get rid of more and more of the security blanket, you lose more and more confidence. You now feel like you look worse than you did with the security blanket. You feel sad. Very sad. You just lay down for a while. But you can’t show everyone else that your sad, ever, but especially right now because you know you look bad. You come to this realization that you aren’t going to be the person you want to be. And that sucks. What do you do when you have already come down a very long path but you know you have an even longer path ahead of you? What do you do? I’m losing hope. This isn’t a cry for help. I’m not gonna do anything to myself. But I’m sad. And I don’t like being sad. I feel like shit but I pretend like I don’t so that not only do I fool the people around me, I fool myself. I brought up many times my family is cool. You’re damn right they’re cool, but as anyone who can relate to my situation knows, there comes a point where it doesn’t matter how cool your family is. You just want to be liked by other people who aren’t biologically programmed to. You just want the reassurance that at least one stranger is friendly enough to like you for you. But you can’t. Because of stuff like this today. You can’t be vulnerable at all because people will burn you for it. It takes one vulnerable text that gets screenshotted or one picture of you to make you a laughing stock. So having come to this realization, you decide to not put yourself in those situations for many years. Yet now it is you who bullies yourself. Everything you do is wrong. You feel like shit one hundred percent of the time. But you don’t show it. 

I just want to know if my situation will get better. I hope it does. I hope that I eventually become confident again. I hope that I can find some interests again. I hope that someone out there is out there for me. I realize that most will look at this and blow it off. I don’t care. I really don’t. Because right now, this is my life. I have to live it. Nobody else. I really hope it gets better. I really really really hope it gets better. Because if not, I will be very sad for a long time. That’s the end, thanks for reading.  ",10Mar2019,1
7,"Yesterday I dragged my feet around the house trying to convince myself to clean. Some things on the list were pretty basic, easy tasks. During my procrastination, I found some chunky heels and flowy pants that I had not yet found a reason to wear. They were a bit summery and dramatic for the cold, rainy day taking place. I put them on and then did my hair and makeup. For a few moments, I felt like a different person. A person who didn't let the little anxieties of the day take over. Someone who just made things happen because she is confident and uninhibited. At least I pretended to be. 

During the time I was cleaning the house, I pretended I was a powerful, put together woman who was tidying her trendy and aesthetically pleasing apartment. All of the things on my list were quickly ticked away, one-by-one.  When I took off my outfit and changed into pajamas, I was back to my anxious self. And I wasn't sure I liked that normal version of myself. 

I do this for other activities so that I can successfully navigate through the stress of daily life...just pretend to be someone else. For job interviews, going out with friends, meeting new people. I'm wondering if pretending is healthy or if I actually eventually develop the habits and personalities of the people I pretend to be.

9,"I don’t have anyone to talk to so... for anyone who cares. My parents have never responded positively to any of my life choices.  The main thing is my choice to invest in a van and travel. I’m so fucking excited and have done so much research into traveling and living in a van, and when I told my parents instead of a “that’s so amazing, it’s going to be such a unique experience! I’m so excited for you”  it’s was “what if ____ , what about _____, when _____ happens I won’t be there to help, you’re too naive and don’t know anything about it.”  Which I understand the fears or concerns of a parent, but Jesus can you just be happy for me for once in my fucking life. And I know that this example might not be the best, but every single thing I do or say is ridiculed, ever sense I was really young.

11,"Paris:

Day 1
I've just arrived in Paris and have checked in to my hostel. There's a man that I'm sharing a room with who snores like I have never heard before. I might have to find a different hostel tomorrow if he continues like that tonight. 

I think it will take me a few days to settle into the travel mindset. At the moment I am feeling slightly overwhelmed and nervous. I was hoping to meet some friendly faces in the hostel but all I've found so far is the snoring man. Hopefully this evening there will be some English speakers or at least some nice people who could help put me at rest. I've never been on my own like this before so it's disconcerting.

Hopefully i will also feel more at ease if i get to the more touristy areas tomorrow. When I woke up this morning i was convinced I was making a mistake by doing this. The fact that i would be isolated for a whole month really sunk in. Maybe i should have gone with a friend. 

Day 2
My room mate, Elaine, is friendly but he speaks about as much English as i speak french, so there isn't much chance for conversation. I met an Australian guy called Zayne at the desk who was having trouble talking to the receptionist. He's also backpacking. 

Today I'm going to try to get to the eifell tower and the city center in general but I'm being held up by the hostels computer breaking, meaning i can't book another night right now. I drank coffee this morning so I'm feeling very jumpy.

I've booked an airbnb for tomorrow night and the evening after that I'll be getting the train to Amsterdam. 

I looked into exploring the catacombs legally and illegally. Neither seemed feasible but i did find out about la petite ceinture which is an abandoned railway around Paris. I'm going to explore that tomorrow.

Day 3
There are loads of Syrian refugees on the streets here. They either have young children or a small animal like a puppy or a rabbit with them. It's heart breaking but i just don't have enough money to donate to them.

There is also a huge racial divide. When i first got off the train, all i could see was people of African origin. Then suddenly, only white people. The refugee crisis is fucked up.

I've stashed my main bag in the locker room of the hostel even though I'm not staying here tonight. Hopefully that won't cause any trouble.

Exploring the abandoned train track was more trouble than it was worth. I decided to walk through a tunnel which took me around 20 minutes. This was boring and dark. When i reached the other end, it was fenced off and had a homeless community next to it. I had to climb over a very high gate with razor wire on the top and i cut my leg. I bit off more than i could chew. 

I'm now sitting in a park reading 'As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning' which is inspiring me a bit. However I'm still feeling out of my element a little bit. I don't think it would be so bad if I hadn't had the railroad experience. 

A man just came up to me and asked if he could take my picture because apparently I was sitting, reading in a certain way. That was weird.

I got to Robert's flat and the room was a lot nicer than a hostel, obviously, but it was the same price. Very nice.

Day 4
I sat in the same park as yesterday and read in the morning. I got bored after a couple of hours and went to buy some food before going to the station. For some reason the metro wouldn't let me buy tickets with a card so i got worried that my card had been frozen. Luckily i was able to still get cash out an ATM. I got to the station 3 hours early which was super boring. The train ride was really nice though. I'm finally starting to feel relaxed. I'm on my way to Amsterdam now. I don't think Paris really agreed with me. Hopefully Amsterdam will be better.

Amsterdam:

Night 1
when i got into Amsterdam at night i immediately liked it more than Paris. It was cosier and had narrower streets and less traffic. The streets were filled even though it was a Monday night. I got to my hostel and checked in. My room was a 12 man dorm and there was a lot of snoring. I later went out to explore the city at night but i didn't really know what to do so i ended up getting drunk and going home.

Day 1:
I wandered around aimlessly for a while, looking at all the strange shops. Eventually I decided to hire a bike for the day. I cycled around, not knowing where i was going. I bought a pre-rolled joint and some food and went to a park.
I went back to the hostel at about 5 to rest up before going out to try exploring the city at night again. The red light district is surreal. Making eye contact with the prostitutes is like staring into the void.

Day 2
It was my birthday so i decided to increase my daily budget for the day. I spent most of the day sheltering in coffee shops from the cold wind. I later met some people from the hostel and we decided to go out and get high. There was a German and 2 Brazilians. The German never stopped talking and i could only understand about 40% of what he was saying and half of that was complete nonsense. It was an interesting night.

Berlin:

Night 1 
I got to the airbnb by uber after various technical difficulties. I thought the uber driver was going to kill us; he was an intense driver.
The room was really cosy and i met a Swedish/German guy there who was very friendly.

Day 1
Turns out the airbnb i booked is a hostel which is fine. It's really nice. I went to a couple of the Berlin tourist spots like checkpoint Charlie and the Holocaust memorial. When i got back to the hostel i met 2 American guys who had come from Hamburg on a business trip. They seem cool. I'm younger than them so it would be weird if i tried to tag along tonight.

Day 2
I didn't really know what to do with myself. I couldn't work up the courage to busk. 
I'm sick of cities so I'm going to the black forest instead of Vienna. I spent the rest of the day preparing to camp in the woods.

Freiburg (The Black Forest)

Night 1(?)
I've spent the entire day on the train. I got on the wrong one so it's taken 3 hours longer than it should have. Turns out wild camping in Germany is illegal so I'm going to have to be careful. I don't think the chances of someone finding me are very high though. It's going to be dark by the time i get to Freiburg so this will be an interesting adventure.
It's nice to be out of a modern urban sprawl. 

Day 1:
I spent last night on a hillside​ that i fought up in the dark. I was on a slope so i kept sliding down but i managed to get to sleep eventually.

I woke up feeling fulfilled and happy. I cooked some rice on the trangia, packed up and went down to the camp site i saw the night before. Luckily they had one space left so I'm now set up there.

It was gorgeous weather so i spent the day walking in the forest and reading in the sun. As the evening came in i started to feel melancholy and lonely. I still am while writing this. I hope i feel better in the morning. I'm hoping to hire a mountain bike if it's not too expensive.

I've been thinking about​ my friends a lot. I uninstalled Facebook and messenger a couple of days ago because i felt like i was trying to keep hold of home with it. I think i have a sort of Stockholm syndrome mentality with them. I get cravings to be with their familiarity but then remember i don't like being around them- especially recently.

Day 2
Last night i had a dream about these animals called 'howards' which had the body of a crocodile and the head of an anteater.

I'm feeling pretty miserable today. I've rented a bike and am currently cycling around the hills. I've fallen off a couple of times which has further dampened my mood but that's not the source. I just feel lonely, tired and isolated. I haven't worked out when I'm leaving Freiburg. Going to Venice tomorrow would be too early but i don't know where else I'll go. I don't want to wild camp because rain is forecast and it's getting colder. I don't know what to do.

I've decided I'm going to Siena tomorrow, or at least a village close to it. My mood has lifted a bit which is nice. I think i was just exhausted after a restless night last night.

Day 3
I packed up and went into town at 10:30 and stayed there for the rest of the day. i finally worked up the courage to busk and i made about €13 which was nice.

Eventually it was time to get on the train. I had realised the route i was originally planning to take had 2 compulsory reservation trains in it so i would have to take a 5 train route from 20:00 to 14:00. I arrived in chiasso at midnight and curled up in a waiting room, trying to get some sleep.

Italy/Badesse

Day 1
My alarm woke me up at 4 and i went to find the platform i would need to get to Milan. This only took about 5 minutes so i could have had another half hours sleep.

When i eventually arrived in Badesse, Andrea met me at the station and drove me to the house. It's so nice. I have the whole ground floor and it's only €22 per night.

Later Andrea took me to Monteriggioni which is an ancient castle- it was beautiful. Having a proper meal for the first time in weeks was a relief.

Day 2
I got the bus to Siena and it's a very beautiful city. However, it seems that the day after i get to a new place i feel low. It's like I'm coming down from the excitement the day before. I also realised I've been forgetting to take my Prozac. This might have something to do with it but I'm not sure. 

Busking is tricky here. You need a permit but even if i got one, i get the feeling the songs i play are not the kind that people want to hear, or if they want busking at all. It would be really nice to get some extra cash but I'm not sure it's possible. I don't think I'm in the right mood for it now either. 

I wish it was as easy to find accommodation as it was for Laurie Lee.

I eventually worked up the courage to busk again but the police stopped me before i could even set up. It was a relief tbh.

I got on the wrong bus. I confused the bus that took me back to Badesse with one that took me all the way to Florence. Luckily i was able to quickly get the train back. Everything turned out fine but i was panic stricken when I first realised.

Day 3
I'm about to go up to Marcello, a town near Vinci which is where Leonardo da Vinci was born. After that I'm going to go to Venice. I'm feeling kind of low now, as usual but hopefully when i arrive there I'll get my new place high.

I couldn't understand the bus timetable or which i should take so i decided to walk/hitchhike from Empoli. It took me about an hour and 20 minutes and took me through some beautiful scenery. I got a lift from 2 separate people.

The place i am staying at is very nice and the host, Tania is very kind and cooked me some pasta when I arrived. I'd like to stay here a bit longer but I'll have to check with Tania if it's possible. I noticed tomorrow wasn't available for check in so it may not be possible.

Day 1
It was fine for me to stay 2 nights longer; Tania is unbelievably hospitable. I spent the day walking around the local area. I followed a stream up through a jungle-like forest and then went to Vinci.

Day 2
Manuel, a guest who arrived the night before is a nice guy and we had a jam as he plays piano. Then Tania took us to meet her friends who make fine wines and olive oil. We were allowed to sample a lot of the wine for free and i got a bit drunk because I'd barely eaten.
We then walked around the market and i eventually split off and went back to the stream. It felt like a little family.

Day 3
Today I'm going to Venice. There's talk of Tania's daughter, Arina coming with me but I'm not sure about that yet.
She didn't end up coming with me but we walked the dog together and it was pretty awkward, for me at least.

I got to the campsite at about 6.30. neither of the people there were the owner and could not really speak English. Eventually we worked everything out and i was given a tent with blankets that was already set up. It was very cosy.

Venice

Day 1
I don't know what it is but something feels 'off' about the farm. The attitude of the people there doesn't match the attitude that's written down. They always seem to be cross with eachother and i haven't really seen anyone else there.
I think i might try to get a room in Venice tomorrow night if i like it enough today.

Day 2
Venice was fantastic. The perfect city for me. I tried to get a room in the actual city but they're all too expensive so I've booked another night at the campsite​.
I decided i wouldn't busk even though it seems good for it because i have enough money as it is and i don't want to have to carry a guitar around unless i absolutely know I'm going to use it.
I realised yesterday that you can get around on the public transport for free pretty much. Busses and trams have ticket validators but no one to check you have a ticket in the first place. It's pretty useful.
I started to feel very weak and unwell in the afternoon so i sat in a park and read for a long time.

Rome

Night 1
I half ran to arrive at my hostel on time. It's quite a nice place although it seems to be in a bit of a dodgy area. I met a cool guy from new Zealand who I've already forgotten the name of. I was woken up by my 2 other room mates coming in at about 6am and then one of them throwing up very loudly.

Day 1
I've bought a Roma pass ticket and am now on my way to pick it up. I'm slowly being reminded that I don't really like big cities. I don't think I'll be staying here long. 

Day 2
The colluseum and forum were really cool and I stayed out until 7 which is a record so far I think. I also happened to see an orchestra playing Carmina burana next to the river which was nice. 
I'm having to carry all my stuff around today until 3 which is a drag but I'm going to go to a museum so hopefully I can drop it off there. 
I talked the one of the Americans who I was rooming with. He's called Lee and seemed nice.
I spent the rest of the day sitting in parks and wandering around museums. There was a Roman military memorial so there was a parade of people dressed as Roman soldiers. 

Tuscany again

Day 1
I'm going back to Tania's for a couple of nights to break the journey from Rome to Zermatt. I realised I've been feeling completely relaxed about being away from home recently and have, at times, not wanted to go home. It's like I've forgotten what home is.

I was asked for money by a woman at the train station so she could buy a baguette. I was frustrated that she was trying to spend what little money she had on a baguette in an overpriced train station shop. I tried to tell her to buy bread or something cheaper but she didn't listen and told me to fuck off. Im not convinced she even needed money.

Day 2
Mum showed me that Zermatt was going to be freezing so I decided not to go. After a long time working out the logistics of where I could go and still catch the ferry on time, I settled on Lucca which is a small walled town.

Lucca:

Day 1
Emilia is very friendly and the WiFi is fast which is welcome. It's raining so I guess I'm staying in for the night.

Day 2
I went into Lucca and wandered around for a bit. Eventually I went up the guinigi tower which was cool. I then went to the botanical gardens to sit around because I felt exhausted. The gardens re-energised me.

Train to Calais:

I'm currently on the 3rd train of 9 I have to take on this 30 hour journey. We're going through the Alps which is nice.

The train got stuck in the snow so we were stopped for a couple of hours without power so my phone died. We ended up having to switch trains but it all worked out. 

I talked to my friends again for the first time since leaving Berlin.

Calais:

Calais isn't very nice. I wandered around the coast for a bit but then went back to the BnB.",10Mar2019,6
13,"Hello everyone!

Td:lr at the bottom

This may be a bit long and I'm sorry. So a while back I started at this little family owned grocery store. I hadn't been there long, and my role at work was to help people bring their groceries to their cars.

One day while helping a regular customer out, I noticed a young women is lying beside the store breathing heavily. During this time it was mid summer so i assumed she was dehydrated. So after helping the customer, I go up to her and begin talking to her.
(Me=me YL= young lady)

Me: Excuse me miss. But are you ok? 

YL: I'm not ok, I dont feel good. Can you drive me to the hospital?

I was a little hesitant because I was still new and I didnt want to get in trouble for leaving work, but I also felt like this lady was in serious danger. So I told her that I would have to ask my boss and if she didnt mind waiting. She just kind if nodded and laid against the wall.

So I go and ask my boss if I can leave just for a bit to drop her off at the hospital down the road, luckily he said yeah. So I grab my keys and a bottle of water and go out to where the lady is sitting.

Me: my boss said it's okay to drop you off, do you need help getting up? I brought you a bottle of water incase you're thirsty.

Yl: Oh thank you so much, I'm sorry I'm troubling you, but thank you so much. Yeah I need a little help I cant feel my legs.

As Soon as she said that, I begin to freak out!!! I'm not a doctor so I dont really know if that's a big deal but I wasn't taking any chances, so I help her up and we walk to my car. 

I give the bottle and she starts guzzling it down and I begin to drive to the hospital, I have the air on full blast to help cool her down. I'm trying to think of what she could be suffering from, I was thinking of possibly a heat stroke or extreme fatigue. 

While driving, she begins to mumble incoherently and I'm getting more worried, cause all she keeps saying is that she sorry and that shes a fuck up. So now I'm panicking and I start tapping her hand and asking her questions.

Luckily she responds a bit slurred but enough for me to calm down. We arrived at the hospital and I go and ask a receptionist for a wheel chair and that I have someone that isnt really conscious.  She calls for a nurse or an aid person and they come help me put her in a wheelchair and roll her in.  They take her to back and I tell them that I dont really know her and I couldnt stay.

I go back to my car and I sit and just think of what happened. I decided that in case she needs anything, I dont want her to worry. So I write up a note that said:
 
Hey, sorry that you're not feeling good. I hope you get better and try not to stress while in a hospital. Sorry I had to leave you but I had to get back to work. Here's a few dollars in case you get hungry or something while in the hospital. Dont worry about paying me back, just feel better

Good Luck!

(Name)

I go back to the station and tell them that she forgot her money. They take it and I hope they just give it to her. 

She never came back into the store with in those years. I just hoped that she was ok and continued living.

Well fast forward about 3 or 4 years, and guess who came in?! The lady!

At first I didnt recognize her and she looked at me funny and said:

YL: You look really familiar, did you ever drop off a lady at hospital? 

Me:*very confused* uh... yeah? A few years ago I did?
 
I now begin to look at her closely and my brain was taking it's time connecting the dots lol.

Me: Was the car red and kind of messy?

YL: Haha yeah it was! Man you did grow up a bit! I just wanted to thank you for helping me back then.

Me: oh dont worry about! I'm just glad I got to help you and it's good to see you! I'm happy you're doing better!

We chit chat back and forth for a while and finally she holds my hands and thanks me again. As she let's go, she put 20$ in my hand...

I freak out for a second and I ask if shes sure, and is it really okay, and that she doesn't need to pay me. 

She just smiled at me and told me:

""Thanks to you, I've been 3 years clean. You helped me when not many people would, I sat outside your store for hours before you showed up. You may not think you've done enough, but to me you saved my life. Thank you and God bless you""

After she said this I cried and hugged her. Nothing like this has ever helped me and even now I cry just thinking about her. 

Thank you for reading, I'm sorry this went on for a while but this means a lot to me. 

Td;lr  lady who I helped when sick came back and thanked me for helping her.",10Mar2019,40

^^Posted that almost 1yr ago. I was full of anxiety, no gf, shit job, few friends that were disappearing and generally a bad look on life. I was pretty encouraged by some of the comments and I thought things were going to be ok. I actually found a new job a few months after, still away from home but a few hours closer which meant I got go back and forth every weekend. 
Things were going ok, I was excited for my new job, I sorta reconnected with my friends and closer bonds with them etc. 
But then I fucked up. 
Till now, I was actually pretty restricted because I didn’t have a car, I was always catching lifts and flying in and out. I ended up getting a car and on my first drive back to my work place from home, I stopped by and saw a prostitute. I have always been struggling with porn addiction , watch that shit like 3 times a day and have a wank, like I got zero self control. Anways I didn’t really think it was an addiction, I did all the online testing and told myself I wasn’t addicted, just had a lot of time on my hands. Anways seeing a prostitute was something I had been wanting to do for agessss, I would sometimes spent like a good hr scrolling through craigslist and shit (btw where I am, prostitution is legal). 
Just to be clear, I am 100% sure I saw the hooker cause I was horny and nothing else. Anways I was super nervous and paid $100 for a hj like an idiot. Went home and felt really really fkin bad. It was a spiral from there and I think I might have spent $5000 on maybe seeing like 40 hookers to date. For the first couple of months I was adamant on retaining some virtue and only got bjs and stuff until I meet this one really beautiful girl and went fk it, and lost my virginity.
Anways I tried to stop a few times and I cant, I just get too horny and all the prior guilt just fkin disappears. I stopped gyming as well, new job is like a carrot on a stick. I get lessier pay and more stress and the exp I want is dangled like a carrot infront of me. These things would infuriate me and I would tell myself fk it I deserve some happiness. But other times I would have a great time hanging with friends and a really good weekend but still see hookers just cause.

A year later and I am no closer to solving any of things I mentioned in my earlier post. 

I started again with gyming, trying to stop seeing hookers and perform better at my job . My biggest fear now is if I ever do meet someone, how do I fkin break it to them, that I had sexual relations with like 40+ hookers. Even typing that is fkin weird, its like one of those movies. Anyone ever been in the same boat as me? I would love to hear stories of ppl who were lonely, spiraling down did some degenerate shit but it turned out ok and they found the girl of their dreams, she was accepting and they settled down and had a great life.

She wags when she sees me then goes straight to her bowl, and is inconsolable when I don't give her more food. She doesn't play with toys, she barely interacts with us, she only wants to eat and sleep. It's been seven months, I've tried everything to make her happy, and I can't. I remember how she was at her foster home, and I know she would be at least somewhat happier there. My heart is breaking, and even though I know this is the right decision, I don't think I will ever stop seeing this as a massive failure on my part.

19,"Earlier today at the doctor's office I was talking with the Physician's Assistant and she commented on how upbeat I sounded. She told me that whenever I'm there I come across as really positive and that it's a nice change from a lot of the other patients she sees. Throughout my teens I was always known as the friend with the monotonous, serial killer-esque voice. I've been working on having more energy in the way I comport myself when I interact with others and while my emotionless voice still sneaks back in sometimes, I'm really happy that someone noticed :)

20,"I've always had to do it in my own. Always had to be the man of the house even from a young age. I couldn't complain, at least not too much. I had to be unselfish and unwavering  for those around me. I had to love others and care for them; so much so I didn't have time to love myself. As such, I bottled everything inside, my troubles,  insecurities and everything in between. I did this for years, from elementary all the way to University.

Then it happened- my breaking point. 

I had an emotional event happen to me that completely messed me up. In a relative sense, the event wasn't a big event. But imagine years of pent up and suppressed emotion and feelings blowing up all at once. I felt...broken. Combine this with the stress of working full time, school, graduation, getting ready for grad school; it was all a recipe for disaster. 

I wrote a suicide note, and was ready to end it all.

Luckily, I reached out to friends before I did it. I've had an amazing support network since the note was written. I am lucky to have people who care and love for me. And all of this made me realize, it's ok to ask for help. It's ok to be selfish every once in a while. There is no shame in knowing there is something wrong. That I have to worry about myself too.

I'm now realizing that in order to better myself, I have to learn to love myself. It will be a journey and it will not be easy. But I'm confident that I can do it. I've done so much of the impossible in my life that this is just another step. I am ready to see where this new perspective on life will take me. 

TL;DR I struggled with self love and care to the point of writing a suicide note, realized I need to care for myself too. ",10Mar2019,301
21,"I’ve been having trouble lately with recurring ear infections. I never really got them as a kid, all that I can remember was one when I was eight, but in the past 2 months I’ve gotten them 3 separate times. I’ve missed around 1-3 days of school on each of them bc no exaggeration, I’m in agony and unable to do anything for the whole time until it heals. I went back to my doctor today for my most recent one, and she said if there’s no improvement soon I should get tubes placed. I mean I’ve seen no improvement over all this time, so I’m likely not gonna magically heal up and not need surgery. I didn’t even know they did tubes past around age 5. I’m almost 17 and feel like the oldest person ever to get them. I’m also nervous because I’ve had one surgery in my whole life, my wisdom teeth last year, and I recovered slower than I was supposed to. Also needles freak me out so I hope they can put me under with the breathing mask. I’m nervous because the thought of having something in my body I wasn’t born with squicks me out (yes, i have tattoos and piercings, but i mean
something *inside* of you, like a metal bone plate or screws) But at the same time, I feel happy knowing if the surgery (which has a pretty high success rate) goes well, I’m gonna go back to my normal life not feeling like my head is about to explode at any given moment",10Mar2019,1

23,"Over the course of the last three years my life has taken a dramatic turn. On the outside not much has changed. Currently I’m a 15M and while yes the people around me have changed over time, everything else is essentially the same. I go to school on a daily schedule just like have for the past decade of my life but for whatever reason my mind functions so much differently than everyone else and often I can’t help but wonder why.

In terms of my passions I’m really not all that different from many other kids. I really enjoy playing video games, watching tv shows, anime and movies. However at some point this hyper self awareness started to develop in my mind. I started evaluating who I am and what makes me tick. Ultimately my current conclusion is that I live for my passions. For me, one of my largest drives in life is getting to experience different stories through different mediums. I look at the world and society I live in and can’t help but feel underwhelmed. I think a big reason why I’d never consider suicide is that right now this is the only way for me to access these stories. Often I think about the possibilities that there are infinite universes all with infinite variables. I take comfort in the thought that every story that pushed me forward through my life has occurred, is occurring and will occur in infinite universes. Because of my belief that there could be infinite possibilities all occurring at any point in time, as unlikely as it may be, there’s a carbon copy of me living in each universe I confide in at this moment. Because there isn’t necessarily any way to prove my hypothesis wrong, I like to play with the idea that although I may never really achieve full immersion with the stories I live for, another me somewhere out there has achieved that which I cannot. Sometimes I wonder if maybe I’m delusional for believing in something so seemingly outrageous but honestly I don’t really care. But I also like to take steps back and analyze myself as an individual in this world. Sometimes I wonder what clicked to make me. Obviously I’m not normal. 99% of people my age or even any age for that matter don’t think like I do. For a while I thought that there had to be someone on this planet who underwent changes similar to me and who thought similarly to me but honestly I’ve given that dream up. I no longer care if I live my whole life without finding anyone else like me. I’m content with confiding in my own mind for my whole life. Currently I’m asking myself what is it that I really want out of my life? 

Sorry if that was a hard read but if you did read it, sorry I wasted your time. It’s doubtful that anyone will ever understand how I truly feel but I still wanted to put my rambling out there. ",10Mar2019,3

...I'm gonna need a new Reddit account though",10Mar2019,22
25,"(sorry for my bad english)

Introduction:
 Hello, my name is Pedro, Wich means Peter in English (I'm from Brazil) and I have a Reddit account that I use to post/look at dumb or interesting stuff, like r/hmmmm, r/choosingbeggars, r/memes and other stuff. I also have a steam account that I use to play games like tf2, CS:GO, HL2, Terraria and others. Since this happened to me some hours ago, I've decided to put it here.

Backstory: So one day I woke up, had coffee and decided to play some Tf2. When I connected to the server, the round was normal until everyone decided to leave. Everyone but me and a player called Maria (I just made that name up since somehow, someone may find her if I tell her real name). So we decided to play 1v1 a bit, and then she asked me to add her as a friend on steam (she was free 2 play, so she couldn't add other people unless she payed $5 on anything on steam, and I wasn't). From then on, sometimes I wold play games together with her, and other stuff (no, this never went so far, and i'm glad it didn't).

 So the main thing happened today, when I asked if she had a discord so she could join some groups (TITANICALLY GINORMOUS mistake), and she said yes and sent the link so I could add her, wich I did.
 Everything went ok until suddenly her discord account name was changed to two letters and the image became a guy with a girl, an actual picture. Then the conversation went like this:
B: brother
Me: mighty eel

Me -what happened, why did you change your name? (I didn't know it was her brother)

B -who are you?

Me -i'm coffy (my steam username)

B -?... Oooo, you are the guy my sister was playing with!

Me -your SISTER?

B -Maria, right?

Me -yes...

*Silence*

Then, I notice her account has unfriended me without a notification (on steam, when someone unfriended you, you are sent a notification), so I decided to find her steam account through discord. And then, I discovered her brother made everything private, and then deleted the account (I think).
I even checked my friends history (where you can see who was once your friend), and there were two, but I knew those two and none of them was Maria, she was gone. I am still chocked, and some minutes ago, I descovered she (or he) blocked me from talking to her on discord.

Theory: I think the profile picture of the guy and grill were actually of the brother and what I can assume is his girlfriend, but that doesn't matter. I actually think the brother though I was a child predator (Wich, of course, I am not, I am a kid at 7° gradde who just wanted to make friends) and thus blocked all possible communications from us. (Remember, this part is just a theory).

Now, I decided to use my Reddit account to post it somewhere, and I think this subreddit is a good option.

26,"First off, I wasn't sure where to put this so I felt I should leave this here.

Just as I'm writing this, I spent the past hour and a half crying my eyes out in the shower. Please, do not be afraid or worry for me. I do not want your pity. I'm mentally healthy and I have finally found the therapy in what is crying.

I'm an 18 year old male and for the past 3.5 years, I've been in a recovery state from a deep depression. I'll try to be as short as possible but this will probably end in me rambling.

To start, I come from a divorced family and I didn't realize until last year how it was terrible for my growth and maturity. Both of my parents tried to alienate me from the other. My mom did it the most and the worst and for a long time, I believed her. I felt like I was a piece of string being pulled on from both ends and having 2 different sets of expectations in my life was misery.

As a kid, I sustained a severe head trauma. I bled out of my brain and was in the hospital for half a week. I still remember after the x ray the doctor telling me I had the largest cranium fracture she'd ever seen on anyone alive. I had to go through 6 years of therapy where my brain essentially had to rewire itself. Surprisingly, I didn't have any major side effects. My main struggles were in short term memory and emotional control.

In middle school, I was bullied profusely by this group of kids. Even though I was the bigger, stronger guy, I couldn't do anything to them. One of the kid's mom worked as the school librarian and another one was on an assistance plan for a physical deformity in his arms. I told the principle and teachers several times but because they were all well liked, they never did anything and I couldn't take justice into my own hands because I had done so in the pas on one of the kids in a situation out of school and a rumor was spreading like wildfire that I was the real bully. This only became worse when my crush who I liked at the time told her guy friends about me because she didn't like me back and they began to come after me as well.

Around the same time the bullying got worse, my relationship with my mother was crumbling. She had caught me with pornography and hit me as a punishment. I never trusted her because of it again and I feared her from that point forward; especially when she slapped me again 2 years later.

I fell deep into depression coupled with anxiety from bad school grades. I was getting close towards being suicidal and wrote a will. My parents didn't know what to do so I was in a psychiatric hospital for 2 weeks. I don't really blame them. They both never really dealt with severe mental issues. 

Therapy helped me and I came out of it and I have since become a 180 degree different person compared to my previous self. Unfortunately, I've kind of been in limbo and a shadow of myself the past few years due to some social issues which has been slowing my recovery but overall, not halting it.

I had to transfer to a different high school starting my freshman year to avoid the bullies from the previous year. It was a good school but in a very rich area. I've always been well off, always had 3 meals a day, cellphone, etc but compared to my hand me down car, these kids got brand new cars from their parents and got to do almost anything they pleased. I never really could make friends due to the culture differences. Through high school, I've only really had one friend in my life and I've been super thankful of him. We do everything together and find at least 15 minutes to hang out every day.

I've also struggled terribly with women. I've never had a true significant relationship with one and have gone 0 for 30 in 3 years of asking girls out. I used to have a female friend I knew ever since I was 8 but when I was about 16, she moved away and turned into a person I didn't know. She became emotionally abusive and manipulative, poking at every insecurity I had and taking advantage of my neediness for love and affection. It was bad and I finally cut ties with her over a year ago.

Despite all my struggles, I've been slowly getting better. Each day, for a lack of a better word, I feel more enlightened and growing more into myself and who I am, even if it's very different to others. I still face my challenges and issues. 7 classes between college and high school (dual credit) as well as working upwards of 30 hours a week part time for the past 2 years has been a bit of a stress inducer. There has been times where the inner-chasms of my heart, despite my cynicism for people and especially women in light of my lack of a relationship between my mother and a previous abusive friend, I have called for affection and love in times of loneliness. 

I remain confident however that things will finally summit and I'll complete my recovery; That this bizarre period in my life where I'm treated like a boy but expected to act like a man will end. That maybe, I will have a woman who truly loves me who I can share my love as well as my lust with her. That I will also have a close knit social circle where I am welcomed and other men who are my brothers appreciate me as much as I appreciate them. That perhaps, life will finally stable out accompanied by the ever so often sparks of spontaneity and excitement. 

Tonight, after being told so many times it's not a manly thing to cry by my family and by society, I found a way to have tears. They were not out of pain or suffering but just out of the emotional tension I'm always under. I did not have sadness or emptiness in any of these tears. I just felt free and not bearing the torture that is stoicism. It has helped in solving problems but it only hurts in relieving the pain. It was very fulfilling and I feel so much better now.

I felt I had to share this. Keep your heads up everyone. Don't let others define you. Seek the best even in most dire situations. Peace to you.",10Mar2019,11

33,"In 2004 I was working as a craftsman. My job was making things according to customer specifications (I'm being intentionally vague about what field I worked in, but it’s a skilled trade). I was in my late 20s and not satisfied with my job. I wanted to make the things I wanted to make, not what my boss told me to make. Decided to go to grad school in an art field related to the trade I was working in, follow my dreams. Boss knew I was unhappy. He told me not to do it. He said I should keep working in the trade. Said something like if I don't stick with it, when I get older I wont have direction or stability or something like that. And if I am really unhappy working for him that I should find a new job or start my own business, it's not that difficult. He will send work my way and try to help me. He said he's giving me this advice as a friend. 

Yeah right I thought. He just wants to keep me around so he can keep underpaying me. 

Recently I realized he was totally right. Grad school turned out to be mostly a waste of time and money. I worked in the trade on and off since then, but never stuck with it long enough that I became really good. Back when I quit working for him I was good, but not as good as I thought. I am now mid 40s and dont have much direction career-wise. I am currently teaching English in Asia. 

The stress and schedule of grad school eventually lead to my fiancee and I breaking up. Yeah maybe we would have broken up no matter what I had done, but I feel going back to school had a lot to do with it. 

The positive side was that leaving my trade did lead to me doing other things I had always dreamed of, trying to make a living with my art (and failing), living and working abroad (twice), traveling around the world. But as I said, I don't really have any direction. I could always go back to the US and work in my trade again, but since I never stuck with it, my pay wouldn't be much more than entry level. Leaving that job and leaving my trade, is the one decision in life I have made that I always wonder what would have happened if I had stuck with it. At the time I was so determined and it seemed like the right thing. But in hindsight I see how I messed up a normal career path.

TL;DR:
I ignored advice to stick with my career, 15 years later I have no direction in life.

35,"This might be a longer post. Sorry in advance.

I dont really have anyone in my life that I'd want to ask about this, soon you'll see why.

Age 11, start getting depressed, mom starts making me fear my own life, start sleeping with knife. Lately been a loner since were always moving so she was the only one I thought I could trust. 

Boop, that's gone.

13 years old tried killing myself by tossing my Nintendo DS in my bathtub with me in it.

It worked for my pokemon, but not me.

Same year I drank a bunch of dish soap.

Ended up being a good way to get out of school and that's about it.

Used to be a fun, outgoing, loving kid. Turned out to be more loner-type than ever, lost all ability to trust any other humans, lost the ability to care for other humans. 

Side note, I can still care for characters of TV or movies, animals or regular people (not actors) I see on the internet or whatever. Just as long as I dont see them in person. If I see a person in pain over the internet, I share that pain. I cry easily. If I see that same person cry about the same thing, I will find them pathetic, and will be pissed off. This is one of the bigger problems I have now. 

After trying to kill myself another two times and obviously failing (fortunately), I started noticing more and more that instead of feeling sad when I'm supposed to, I feel angry. 

Instead of feeling the emotion of defeat in a video game, I feel angry and yell. (Like a lot of others but stick around for exhibit 2)

Instead of feeling bad about messing up a responsibility, I'll get mad and argue in whatever I can. 

Instead of feeling sorry for my mom who has taken care of me all my life and may die soon, I just feel anger whenever she asks me for something or struggles to even call my name. ""Pathetic"", I think.

But I dont want to be like this. I dont want to have to force myself to cry in order to stop a panic attack when I dont even know why I'm panicking. I dont want to have to think about another person's pain in order to cry. I want to realize my own pain. I want to accept other peoples pain when they're in front of me.

But I dont want to be put on meds. I dont want to become dependent on them and end up like my dad.

I want to raise a daughter and never have to explain to her that if I forget my pills one day, i might swerve off the road like my father.

Most of all, i dont want to pass this down to my child. 

I dont want them to grow up wondering who they're going to wake up as or wondering what part of them is anxious or feel like someone else is controlling their subconscious and they're just piloting a husk. I dont want my daughter to have scars.

I dont want my daughter to kill herself.

I tear up just thinking about the pain she may go through. But I'm not afraid of seeing her body. Nor am I afraid of seeing my mother's. Nor my sister's or my nephew's or my brother's.

So I'll end it here with this bit.

I've taken meds before, and they've lifted my mood. But they've never made me care for anyone. Not even myself. 

After trying to kill myself the fourth time, meds arent an option for me.

So...is this just my outlook being shit? Or is it something wrong with my brain? 

If it's something actually medically wrong with me I can always adopt I guess. That should be fine.

Note: 

I thank anyone who stuck around to read the entire post. I honestly didnt know where else to take this. I felt like some page or forum for ""depression"" would lead to a bunch of people showing sympathy that I cant properly process or even trust. 

With that being said, please dont comment any ""good vibes"" stuff here. It makes no difference to me. Dont tell me your story or how you're similar. If you read all of that, you should know that it doesnt matter in my eyes because I eont believe it, nor can I sympathize with you. Not to be a dick, but that's how it is. Just tell me if I'm fucked or not. 

Thanks.

48,"I recently had a boyfriend who was actually perfectly nice. I had no complaints after about 2 months of dating. Things were never particularly amazing but we had fun and we both found each other attractive. 

We broke up pretty randomly but mutually and amicably after a serious conversation about 2 months ago, both stating disdain for long distance (he’s moving a couple hours away at the end of the summer, not particularly soon). When people ask why we broke up I tell them we just weren’t that into each other, which is probably true.

We’ve hung out several times since then, and it’s cool. We’re able to be friends. I do his community service (long story, but stupid driving misdemeanor) with him sometimes and he still plays video games with my brother online. We text about little things a couple times a week.

Tonight I invited him out to play pool with some of my friends to act as sort of a buffer because I enjoy hanging out with him, but not them so much. I had committed to go so I figured I’d make it more enjoyable for myself, and they told me to invite whoever because the more the merrier. It ended up being really fun and then he and I hung out for a while after the rest of them had to go home.

We got food and talked for 2.5 hours. We were able to comfortably talk about exes the way you might with a friend, and we talked about our relationship the way you might talk about fun memories with a friend. 

I guess I’m just surprised that being friends with an ex has gone this smoothly so far. It’s probably because we weren’t that invested in each other romantically before making that switch.  There’s no bitterness or jealousy or imbalance of feelings or regret. I really enjoy his friendship.

I can’t say we’re super involved in each other’s lives, but I’ll send him a picture of my new Vans and he’ll text me to tell me about how he was able to get something on his car repaired for cheap. I like the level of involvement we’ve sustained. It’s not too involved but we’re able to get together sometimes and enjoy each other’s company without forcing anything. We’re close and we connect, but we don’t need to hang out all the time. It’s not tiresome for me, someone who thrives on alone time. We stay updated on each other’s lives. We’re going to a jazz bar together sometime this week!

Anyway I just wanted to share how nice it is. It feels weird that being friends with an ex has been so easy, because things usually don’t go that way. I needed a friend like him.

She had just gotten out of a relationship and didnt want anything serious, yet still felt strongly for me. I'd end up giving her rides to work, since she doesn't have a car but, she would end up going to bars with a fwb almost every single time (knowing full well how I felt about her, she would tell me about it every so often. Hurt to hear).

A couple of weeks back, she told me she suddenly felt different about me and I ended things after a friend of mine told me she was with another guy at a bar, being very intimate. Noticed how she posted about being choked all weekend and quickly took down the post (probably thinking I would see it). Fast forward to a month presently, I'm feeling a little bummed out last night. Saw a comment from her on one of friend's Facebook posts and noticed she was already in a new relationship. My instincts told me that the ""pal"" she was hanging out with on the weekend I ended things with her was what made her suddenly lose feelings for me and my suspicions were correct. I'm not obsessing over it or anything like that but, for the that moment I felt sad. Like I was so easily replaced. 

I haven't been missing her, and when my mind would try to go back to ""happier"" times, I would audibly tell it to shut the fuck up lol. Seeing how quickly she went into a new relationship like that after telling me she wasn't ready and wanted to wait a year, it hurt. I know what type of person she is but, still though, it hurt to see how quickly she moved on from me. Mind you, she was sleeping around when i was into her (claiming she can have feelings for me and still fuck other people, which is apparently what happened with her new guy). Despite all the negative behavior (like doing coke, using sex to cope with negative feelings) I still wanted to be with her cause she made me believe she felt the same way (she'd tell me she loved me platonically and not platonically, or straight up tell me she was in love with me).

 I was coming back from school. My home is pretty far from school around thirty minutes of walking. I had six classes in school and it lasted to 19:10 so around 19:40 I was near my house. But before I could get to my home man stopped me, he smelled of alcohol. ""Balinkuro!"" (Hurtful word for Muslim woman from Bosnia). I looked at him not understanding what did I do to him to call me that. ""You are not in Saudi Arabia don't wear that!"" He screamed trying to take off my headscarf. When I didn't he smacked me across face, ""I will cut you open, and slice your throat""  He got knife from his pocket and putted it on my neck. I was terrified. I began praying to God to safe me from this, and thank to Him. I closed my eyes just to feel weight of this drunk man get off of me. I slowly opened my eyes to see four mans beating hell out of him on floor. One of them approached me and asked if I was okay I just nod, from shock I couldn't speak.

This is regarding my husband &amp; myself:

One of us had been in the midst of changing jobs.  It had been a fairly whirlwind few months' experience including call-backs to 2 different companies.  One company offered the job and s/he wanted to give current job plenty of time (months) for transitioning during a fairly complex time work-wise.

Meanwhile the other of us' mother had been recently diagnosed with lung cancer; going through radiation &amp; chemo. \[the mother &amp; some siblings were in another state\].  She became hospitalized (weeks) for unknown reasons.  Tests were run &amp; pain was managed.  Doctors decided to do another biopsy which caused the mother to hemorrhage and die on the table.  So, though there was a cancer diagnosis to a smoking woman approaching 70, the act of dying was more sudden than one would have expected.

Both of us took bereavement leave from work to go to other state for 2 days for the funeral.  We stayed in a hotel nearby, not wanting to overcrowd family members.  

To make a sad time even sadder, the day of the funeral was her child's birthday.

The job-seeker used the morning of the birthday-funeral to call current company to give notice quite unexpectedly to 2 bosses and then formally accept new offer using hotel's fax capablities.  It was a pretty tense phone call.

It would be fair to say that majority of the time I [29yo] just feel terrible or at unease. The turmoils of life, both internally and externally, make me feel as if I’m standing on my toes off the edge of a cliff, all the time. We don’t hesitate to treat each other horribly. Sometimes, I feel there is an inalienable and inescapable evil that resides within us people.

But just as if you were drawing, and with all your might and every cell in your body you try to reach for the surface of the water to catch a breath, and when you do, it’s the most precious air you’ve ever inhaled in your life, it happens with me in throughout my days. 

I sometimes meet people who are so kind and graceful and perhaps will never see them again, but they fill my heart with joy by merely them being them. And some other times I experience a fleeting emotion that is so raw and crisp at the same time. 

In the midst of all the misery, which I have come to an agreement with and would seek mainly peace but also hope for joy, I would have this thought-image where these feelings of joy and grace are constant and are the natural state of affairs. A heavenly state of mind. 

I’m thankful for the the kind, and pure hearted, people whom I’ve met, I’ll always try overcome my wickedness and evil tendencies and be kind to whom I meet because I have a feeling that there are many like me who would just appreciate a pure spirit.

I’m not sure where I want to guide this self post, but I guess I would want to thank the person today who made me realize that his acceptance doesn’t make or break me. If you’d like to read specifics on who I am and how I realized it, read on!

Currently, I’m a fairly young 30 yr old graduate student on a trip to a middle eastern country with several other 20 yr old undergrad students. Oddly enough, this isn’t my first time I’ve been on an overseas trip overseas with undergrads and I’ve experienced similar feelings last year as I have this trip so far. Those feelings? Loneliness and Out of touch are two ways I would describe some of my experiences. Lonely, because I’m not a part of their undergrad experience such as frats, sororities, one night flings every one knows about, and similar stuff their experiencing together. Out of touch because I have Little to no connection to their lives because I live off campus with a partner while the rest of the students are forced to live on campus.  

So now to the juicy stuff—When I sat down in one of the front seats of our tour bus we were being driven in, I asked a colleague if he would mind moving his bag so I can sit and join in on some conversation everyone was having in the front. I noticed he was distant so I didn’t bother him. Actually, Ive noticed he hasn’t felt like conversing with me when I try to joke with him during the trip—so far I thought “that’s ok, maybe somethings up in his life.”  

Well after sitting next to him for around 20-30 mins, I glanced at his bright iPhone X screen and see he is texting some close friend who is in the back of the bus. My heart dropped as soon as I saw” WHY THE FUCK IS THIS BITCH SITTING NEXT TO ME.” The friend replied with” HAHAHAA.” I guess I immediately began thinking what I have done wrong to this person to make them feel this way towards me?

After several moments and hours of internal dialogue I had with myself, I concluded that it’s ok for him not to like me because of all the really close friends and family that care for me that I have that I can call at a moments notice. 

Thank you for inadvertently showing me your feelings person. People like you make me a tougher person to one day be a shining example for my daughter.

Not gonna lie, I'm on my period and I get cramps really bad and for now, they've gone away. So happy about that. I feel like I can finally relax and allow my sore body a break from stressing out too much. Honestly, I could fall asleep.

75,"My earliest childhood memories are getting in trouble and constantly having anxiety about getting in trouble by my mom. She was never physically abusive and she never really even yelled much but she would shame me or make me feel guilty or embarrass me whenever I would do or say something wrong. Countless times as a child I recall thinking “wow I wish I had known that was wrong before I did that just so I could avoid her getting mad at me”, because most of the time I really didn’t know that what I was doing was wrong and instead of just explaining something to me she would automatically discipline me. Anyways, fast forward. The anxiety and fear of my mother never went away, I’m an adult now and I still feel it. This has prevented me from having a close relationship with her. I am afraid to tell her anything personal in fear of being put down or judged. To be quite honest, all of my life I never felt like she really loved me. The only time she would ever be proud of me was when I would accomplish something impressive (like a high grade at school or a scholarship) but as soon as I would fail at something instead of supporting me, again, she would shame me. In fact, for a long time as a teenager I was severely suicidal because I felt like I was a burden to her. I’m not suicidal anymore, but still feel like a burden. 

My mother just informed me that I don’t love her and that hurts her so much that she almost had a heart attack because of it. She told me she didn’t want my love when she would be dead but she wanted it now... but 1) it’s hard for me to show love with how she raised me (to basically be afraid of her), and 2) it’s hard for me to show love after I feel like she is manipulating me to (apparently I’m the reason for her almost heart attack?)

Just to clarify, what she interprets as me “not loving her” is me always staying in my room, not talking much with her, not hugging her everyday, etc. Its more a lack of affection rather than anything abusive on my part like yelling or lying to her. 

I don’t think she has considered how much she has hurt me too, she only sees how I’ve hurt her. I have no energy to explain it to her how I feel, because I have tried in the past and it has failed. I don’t want to make myself vulnerable again. But in the midst of all of this I find myself questioning whether or not I could truly be the one at fault here? Maybe I really am a bad daughter for not trying harder to work past this? I’m a very sensitive person and I take everything to heart, that’s just the way I am. I don’t think she understands what that’s like (because she’s not really like that). I don’t think she realizes how much of what she has said/done to be (as far back as my earliest memories even) I still carry around with me... ",10Mar2019,9

79,"I've been a reddit user for several years but I've noticed that I drew no useful benefit out of it. I did get some information that I couldn't have acquired otherwise but most of the content is empty and lifeless.

Asking for advice on reddit is hopeless. The most black and white views are presented as solutions to problems that have way more complicated contexts. I feel like I made some bad moves because of some of the advice I received. Knee jerk reactions are common with people giving internet diagnoses and repeated advice that has no meaning or usefulness.

The worst part is the content. Poor conversations and many subreddits are just circlejerks for poorly informed people. Others just post insipid content or something of no values, it's just pictures and memes. I understand some people enjoy that stuff but it's simply not for me.

I found myself posting useless things of no value, even my blog is more interesting. I posted things I didn't believe or hoping for good advice but it was always empty in response. Reddit made me impulsive and I regret some of the choices that were suggested to me.

I had a good time on reddit, I'll leave this account open for a while but soon it will be deleted and I'll visit this website very infrequently. I'm not angry or mad, it's just this place isn't for me.

88,"Hi, erm, I guess I'm writing this here as I just wanted somewhere to vent maybe, well, not vent, but... speak? Anyway..

I'm, let's say Earwax - my parents were creative - I'm 21 and have just Dropped Out of university in my third year of a four year degree in the UK. (Dropped Out may be too far: I'm pausing my studies, let's say, but I doubt I'll go back.) I've made the best of friends there, I really have. Most are graduating in the summer after their upcoming exams but are pursuing Masters' and things like that, moving to London and all, the usual Post-University Student Migration.

I know I couldn't stay at university - my mental health has been deteriorating exponentially over the last year, a slow burn of many years previous, but at least I'm medicated now - so I dragged out how long I could stay before formally pausing my studies, managing to do, at most, the bare minimum of work in second year and none at all in third year. And now I'm here: a quiet suburb with my dad, a parent who I've grown closer to in time, while ever further from my mom, the parent I grew up with. She's different now, but I shouldn't ramble too much!

My friends, they're not one-dimensional. No one is? But they have good prospects - they'll get their degrees, they'll get jobs they enjoy in time (a few already have offers, one has one sorted, no specific final grade required either). But I don't quite know what I want, not anymore, I can't seem to think past each day, something that I think'll hurt more as these days become quieter and increasingly more lonely as I spend them, well, alone.

To be honest, I feel lost, scared. This is my life, at least right now. It'd be a strange experience to, in, say, ten years time, look back on Now and know that Everything Will Work Itself Out and you'll be 31 and you'll be Okay. Maybe.",10Mar2019,2

96,"March 9th, I received an email from Chipotle thanking me for ordering with them. Completely confused, and knowing I’ve been purposely avoiding all types of delivered food, I check the email. 36 dollars has been spent on chipotle and delivered to an address in NV. I close the email in disbelief and see other emails from the restaurant thanking me for other orders. In total, $124.59 has been spent since March the 8th until March 9th (3 orders in NV and one in IL. Neither of which are the states I live in).

I remained calm knowing this can be easily reported to the bank and reimbursed. I went to my bank’s mobile app to assess the damage. Fingerprint not accepted. Manually typed password not accepted. Attempted password change including my user and email. Credentials not accepted. I’m stumped. I remembered receiving an email stating an account, from the bank my parents use, had an email change (I previously managed my dad’s account due to his dementia, and by this time, been replaced by my half-brothers once they placed legal action against my mom for things that did not happen, and did not have proof for). I use the email that I assumed replaced mine for my father’s account, clearly with my brother’s name, to reset my own account’s password. My heart is pounding wildly thinking that these brothers who I try to avoid, still go out of their way to see me struggle. It goes through and sends a password reset to the email that, I now realize, replaced my own personal banking account with. 

Geez, one of the few things I finally felt in control of is up in the air. My parents had bad financial habits/thinking, and I wanted so badly to not make their mistakes. It was now out of my control. A brother who I have never been close to, and feel only distrust towards has my account. My previous bank account logins have been on their mobile and I’m not completely sure what is available via desktop. I know him, and possibly another paternal half-brother, are able to see my email, number, and all my bank transactions. I’m now worried they saw my address and work address in my account. 

So far, I reported the issue with Chipotle and waiting for my correspondence. I’ve also made a complaint with the Internet Crime Complaint Center. There is no fraud line available at my bank after hours or on Sundays. I reported my card stolen on my bank’s automated call service and waiting for tomorrow to speak with them in person.

Family background: My parents had previous marriages/children. My dad is 15 years older than my mom, my mom is 5 years older than my dad’s oldest son. Paternal half-brothers ages range from 48 to 54. My maternal siblings age range 27 to 38. I am 21. I continue to have a good relationship with my siblings on my mom’s side. My dad’s sons never liked my mom, but did nothing against me. After my dad’s stroke and aneurysm when I was six, his sons stopped coming around. My parent’s relationship was very strained, and my dad resorted to calling his sons to plot against my mom. Together, they’ve made plans to take away my mom’s nursing license, dragged her through court to place a protective order on grounds of domestic abuse that she never did (my dad became more combative as his dementia progressed. Me and my mom would have to get out of his way when he was this way), without knowing his finances they took my dad to his bank to make a new account thinking my mom was stealing money, one of the brothers find out where my sister worked and tried to cause a commotion there, and they’ve stalked my mom to an address she was staying at temporarily. Things like this have happened between the time I was 13 and until now at age 21. Of course it’s not a daily thing and there’ll be months or years that they won’t bother us. But it bothers me so much they think this is for my dad’s sake. We do not wish anything sinister against them, and have not stooped this low against them. They are  very convinced my mom is the worst woman and that I must be just as supposedly terrible as her. ",10Mar2019,1

102,"I'm currently a senior in high school. This is the last year I've got in a school before I'm drafted to the army (mandatory service). I feel the way I do because it looks as no one of my friends notice or care about me, although I help them with whatever they need. For example, one friend of mine was having troubles with his girlfriend a year ago. He would call me at midnight out of the blue when there's school the next day and he would tell me all about it and ask for my help, these calls would usually last 30 to 60 minutes. Instead of going to sleep I listened to him. 
I help everybody but they choose to make fun of me, they mock me whenever they can. 
Moreover, at the end of the summer we had a week long school trip abroad, which I didn't go to because of personal reasons.
They did go and it seems that they found new friends. Whatever bond we had is just gone. We don't go out as a group a lot and whenever I suggest something, at best they reject, but most of the times they just hang me out to dry not  responding to my any of my message.

103,"So I'm a 17 yr old high school senior , reaching the end of school. I have a pretty big passion and love for visual arts and anything that has to do with cameras. I've done film making and photography ever since I was little. And my dream is to be good, make a living off of it and make dope content. Currently, due to my family and shit I haven't really been able to really grind on my craft at the level I'd like. So in the mean time I've been doing editing, and so far I've been making some money off that. 

I know it's extremely hard and there's always the chance it won't work out but I rather fail than have never tried. 

Now here's the problem. Aside from the problems in my own home, there's an extreme amount of pressure for me to goto college. I completely understand why a parent would want their child to goto college, aside from the social stigmas, there's the fact that if you don't have a degree it can be pretty hard to get a job. 

Before I continue, a very very long time ago, one of my family members got me a prepaid scholarship. Which means my tuition is covered. 
Which I'm extremely grateful for and appreciative. 

But I honestly don't wanna go. I don't particularly enjoy school. I feel like it's not really for me. Don't get me wrong, I think college is a great thing. but I just feel like it'd be a waste of time for me to go. All the schools that offer film and photo programs are private (my prepaid scholarship doesn't cover private institutions) or the schools are just not in a commutable area. So this means that if I goto college, I'd have to study something that I don't really enjoy and something that isn't going to help me take my life in the direction I'd like to take it. 

I personally much rather build and make a name for myself, working a job on the side and living outside of my parents home. 

I know it's a difficult path but again, I wanna see if it works out or not. 

My plan right now is:

 to leave after graduation and live with my girlfriend for about 2 months &amp; work on getting our own place. Going 50/50 on all expenses. (We already have some money saved up) 

since I'm in high school and it takes up a large chunk of my day, Im waiting till the last month of school to start working again. (This will be my main source of income) so as of right now, I'm just saving up money from my commissions and flipping. 

And then just do what I'm doing now but with a lot more freedom, so I can do way more shoots and goto events etc. 

It's pretty hard explaining my plan in concrete words along with my emotions. But if you have any questions please feel free to ask !

104,"First off, I know this is not NoSleep, I just need to share what's been actually happening to me to maybe get some objective opinions here. 

&amp;#x200B;

I (M/34) bought a townhouse about 3 weeks ago, my first real estate purchase ever. I was, and still am very excited about owning my own place but I'm starting to become concerned about some things that I've noticed since moving in. My GF lives in another state and will be moving in with me in a couple months once her work situation allows but I haven't told her any of this because I don't want to freak her out. I am currently living alone, my dog unfortunately passed away of natural causes a few weeks before I moved and I don't have any other pets. It's a townhouse so it's attached to other units, but mine is the end unit (a big factor in buying this particular unit) so I only have 1 shared wall with a neighbor and it's *very* quiet in the neighborhood. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'll get right into the weird stuff. The house is too large for one person, it's a 2 bed, 1.5 bath and a loft area above the other bedroom. I rarely even go into the spare bedroom and loft because I don't have furniture or lights in there yet and it's cold because I closed the vents to circulate heat in the other rooms. When i say I don't go in that room it's not because of anything weird or creepy, I just dropped some boxes in there on day 1 and haven't needed anything from those boxes yet. I have had to go in a few times to take measurements and test electrical outlets and stuff, but otherwise the doors stay closed 24/7 since it's really drafty.

&amp;#x200B;

I work in a hospital and have to bring my ID badge with me every day. If I forget my badge I won't be able to clock in, eat lunch, open doors, etc. It's a huge deal if I forget it. As such, I keep my wallet, keys and work ID on a shelf in the entryway and I'm *systematic* about this. As soon as I reach the entryway from the garage, which is attached, I put those 3 things on the shelf so they are right there the next day when I need them. This was the same ritual I had in my previous place so it's not a new thing, just a new location. I think it was the 3rd day I was there, keys/wallet/ID ritual already in place, but when I went to leave for work I just could not find my ID. I tore the house up looking for it, checking everywhere except the spare bedroom and loft since I literally had not gone in those rooms since the day before when I got home from work. I had to leave since I was already going to be late and just dealt with not having my ID for that day. I checked my car, clothes, laundry, trash, couch cushions, I even walked the half mile to the main road, retracing my route in case it flew out the window of my car or something. I had to go the next day without my ID as well as I still couldn't find it.

&amp;#x200B;

A day after that I was moving some boxes into the spare bedroom and decided to just go up to the loft and take a quick look around, not even looking for my ID anymore since I was going to have it replaced the next day, just to take stock of the space and decide what type of furniture to put in there. Right in the middle of the mostly empty floor of the loft was my ID badge. Just sitting there in the middle of the rug. I have NO idea how it got there since, like I said, I literally hadn't even opened the door to that room for at least a day before I even lost the ID badge. I was perplexed by that but relieved that I had my badge back since replacing it costs like $35 through my workplace. I didn't really think too much of it and figured maybe it was in my pocket and simply fell out, though i can't remember ever carrying it farther than the entryway shelf ever. Whatever, I have a bad memory anyway and it's possible I'm just dumb.

&amp;#x200B;

In that loft there is a small crawlspace with ventilation pipes, electrical stuff and insulation everywhere. It's not a room, it just looks like a normal unfinished attic space but it does go back pretty deep, maybe 10 or 12 feet. It's not a storage space because there's no floor and it has a small, maybe 3x3 square wooden door to close it off. I took a peak in there during the open house walk through and once again after I had changed all the locks and had my own keys made, basically to be sure that the previous owners didn't store any junk up there that they just didn't want to move out or something, but it was totally empty so no problems. A few days after I found my ID badge in the loft for no apparent reason I had to go back in there to take down a wall-mounted TV that the previous owners had left me. It worked but had really bad burn-in from the previous owners and I just decided to replace it entirely. I went in to the spare bedroom and up the stairs to the loft. The fucking little door was wide open. Now, again, I had not been in the room since I found my ID in there 3 days prior and I KNOW that door was closed because I looked at it, making a mental note as to whether or not I could cover it with a small couch. The little door has a normal doorknob that clicks into place when it's properly shut just like a normal door would. There's no locking mechanism on the knob. There is a carpet in the loft that's pretty fluffy so the door has to drag along the carpet in order to open, leaving that unique crescent moon shape in the carpet whenever it's opened. There was no marking in the carpet this time, only fresh-looking vaccuum cleaner lines from when I had vaccuumed the previous week. I looked into the crawlspace with icicles shooting up my spine, shined the light from my phone in there and saw nothing unusual. I closed the small door, making drag marks on the carpet when I closed it and pushed it shut until I heard it click into place. No immediate explanation for that one since it takes effort to open the door and drag it across the carpet, not something that the wind could do, there are no open windows or vents in that room at all, it doesn't even have electricity at the moment (also one of the reasons why I don't go in that room very much, I get home from work after dark and don't want to go poking around a dark room with no electricity). 

&amp;#x200B;

I also have some motion activated night lights throughout the house. They only turn on when it's dark AND there's motion in the area, they're pretty good quality and have been very reliable, I already know exactly when they'll turn on based on where I am in the hallway or rooms. I have one in the entryway on the first floor, another at the top of the stairs from the entryway and another in a hallway, so basically 3 in a row that all turn on when I get home from work before I can reach my light switch. Last night I was trying to relax in my living room, which is where the entryway, stairs and hallway lead to. It was getting late, after 1am and I only had one small table lamp on next to me with the TV on. Suddenly I noticed a faint glow coming from the bottom of the stairs. I can't see the light itself directly but I can see it's reflection on the wall. Then I see the middle nightlight turn on just as the first one at the bottom of the stairs turn off. Then the third nightlight turns on as the second one turns off. I'm just staring at the stairs and hallway, too frozen to move but manage to mute the TV and just sit there as the third nightlight turns off. Nothing. I quickly went up to my bedroom, locked the door and tried to zone out until I fell asleep.

&amp;#x200B;

There have been a couple other small, weird things like the doors to my toaster oven being open one morning when I hadn't used it the day before at all and know I wouldn't leave them open since I have a small pantry kitchen and the doors actually get in the way of things. I also *think* I heard faint music from somewhere in the house one night last week but I'm deaf in one ear so it's pretty impossible for me to triangulate where sounds are coming from and just assumed it was my neighbor with the shared wall, even though that shared wall is on the opposite end of the house from where I was hearing the music. I got up and walked around a bit to try to pinpoint where it was coming from but it almost seemed to be coming from wherever I was checking as the sound never really got louder or quieter, it just seemed to stay at the same level of being barely audible no matter where I checked. I did not check the loft that night.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I know this was long and probably more than stupid to post but I don't have any close friends and moved a decent distance away from any family and haven't told my GF about any of this out of fear of scaring her away from moving in or having her think I'm trying to mess with her for some reason. I'm actually feeling pretty alone in this situation, I haven't become friendly with any neighbors since it's winter and nobody is ever outside. I'm at work right now and, honestly, I'm a little nervous about going home out of fear of finding more stuff that doesn't seem to make sense but if anyone is interested I can post some photos when I get home to give you a better idea of the layout and stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

For what it's worth, I have multiple Carbon Monoxide detectors throughout the house since my garage is pretty much right below my living spaces and none have gone off and they are all functioning. I could probably chalk up one of these things to circumstance or my overactive/stoned imagination but I'm beginning to think something is going on here. I haven't shared EVERY little thing that's happened since some of them could be me being forgetful or careless but since I'm the only person in this house and very much a creature of habit, I find it hard to convince myself that that is 100% the case with everything that's been going on.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? I'm hoping to brush this off and forget all about it but every time I get home there's a part of me that's almost expecting something to be out of place or not how I left it.

105," To my Ex,   	

Strange calling you my ex, since 3 months ago I would have said it was more likely that we would be married than broken up at this juncture. But you’re just that now, my ex, and honestly, you’re nothing more to me. I have been clinging to this hope that we can remain friends, false hope that was only made stronger when we met for coffee and you told me you were sorry about the cheating, and about the way things ended, and that you wanted to be friends too. But that was over a month ago, and now we haven’t spoken in weeks, all because you suddenly said you weren’t sorry for cheating.  	

&amp;#x200B;

That is so fucked up. I can’t believe you would call me your best friend, even after the breakup, but have the audacity to say you aren’t sorry for cheating. And then when I tried to reach out to talk, initially to make amends, to once again fall into the pattern of the last 3 years we were together when all I wanted was to make things right between us, even if it meant apologizing when I didn’t think I was at fault, but then you ghosted me. Look, I get it, we’re not dating, I’m not your top priority any more. But you said you wanted to be friends, even best friends, and suddenly you decide not to address this horrible tension, to ghost me for basically three weeks before bailing on a conversation that needed to happen. Even up to then I wanted to make it work. Frankly I was pretty pissed off about the ghosting, but I still felt like for the sake of the memories of our relationship, I couldn’t just let my best friend for the last 3 years end it like this. But then you bailed without giving me a heads up when we were supposed to finally talk. And that is so fucked up, not only that, but then you just ceased to make any additional effort.  Look, I loved you sincerely at one point, and at one point we were best friends and genuinely would do anything for each other. But clearly at this point you don’t even care about me enough to show me common human decency, and if this is your idea of friendship I don’t want any part of it. I think you need to grow the fuck up. If you genuinely aren’t sorry for cheating on me multiple times, when I tried to make everything work, I tried to be in an open relationship that I didn’t want, I tried to be open an honest with you, I tried to be as good as I could for you even with my own depression and all of the shit that has been plaguing me ever since I graduated. I never did anything to you, all of the faults in the relationship that I brought to the table where about how I couldn’t be good enough, and frankly I don’t blame you for feeling that way, that the relationship needed to end. But I never cheated on you, I never lied to you, I trusted you and I was always honest with you. I was a great boyfriend, even if I was an incredibly flawed person. But you cheated on me. There is not moral equivalency. There is no fault on my part for your decision to weigh your own immediate need to fuck someone over being upfront and honest and ending our relationship before then. You can believe that you didn’t end it because you didn’t want to drive me deeper into depression, or because I was going through a had time, or because you “wanted to make it work,” but at the point of the cheating, it never could have worked, even if I would’ve forgiven you in the moment. I could never trust you again, and clearly the love we once had was gone, otherwise you wouldn’t do something so hurtful to me, multiple times, with people I considered friends.

I think you were a coward, and I think you’re being a coward now, and quite frankly, after all the shitty things you’ve done, during the relationship and since the breakup, I just don’t care anymore. I’m so much happier now than I was at the end of our relationship, and I’m happier with you not owning my headspace anymore.  Even at this point, with all my anger fading and my general feeling towards you turning to apathy as opposed to antagonism, I’m still willing to make it work, a friendship that is. When we’re really friends, we have good times, and I definitely have no fear that I’ll be tempted to start dating you again, that ship has sailed for good as far as anything I’m even remotely interested in. Like I said, the trust is gone. But while I’m willing to make it work, I’m done being the person trying to fix it, I’m done putting in the effort. I cannot be friends with you fi you aren’t sorry for cheating, because that just shows a clear lack for any regard for my feelings, or for me as a human being. I don’t care if you “had your reasons,” those reasons are excuses and not justifications, and if you don’t recognize that, then there’s really no point in trying to be friends. But also, I’ve made the effort, I’ve put in the attempts to reconcile earnestly and openly. At this point, I get the message, you don’t want to be friends either. And that is fine by me. We were good once, but now that is over, and I get to find someone else, someone that is better for me and who will love me in all the ways I once thought you did. If you decide that you want to make some sort of friendship work, or even if you just want to apologize for cheating, or for ghosting me, or for anything, you know how to reach me. ",10Mar2019,1
106,"So I’m 20 and I’ve never dated anyone, mostly because up until very recently nobody has been interested, and I have a major habit of forming massive crushes on  people that never go anywhere but last for months. I had a massive thing for my best friend, for instance, that has lasted about a year and a half now and I’d still say some feelings linger a little. I think she’s probably the first person I’ve really been ‘in love’ with, every other time I’ve fell for girls I don’t really know. I know like everything about her and still think she’s one of the best people I’ve ever met. Lately I’ve gotten a little more interest from the women in my life, and things are kinda turning up. Having had such little luck and never having the feeling be reciprocated had kinda made me emotionally hardened me though, like I dunno if I’ll feel like that again for a girl anytime soon.

That said, there is a girl I know who is almost definitely interested. The thing is, while I think she’s insanely physically attractive, to the point that my friends all laugh at her liking me cause she seems so out of my league, I just don’t have a ‘spark’ with her that I’ve felt before with others. Like when I fall for someone, I KNOW I’ve fell for them. It hits me hard. But I think this has made me really picky when it comes to who I date. Like I’ve never dated anyone, and here’s a girl who likes me, who I think is really hot, and I’m sitting here hesitant to give her a chance because she doesn’t send me fucking crazy with emotions. People would kill to be in my situation. Hell, I would have before, I remember when I first met her I thought she was one of the best looking girls I’d ever met.

But at the same time, am I really gonna date someone I’m not 100% into just cause the chance doesn’t come up often?  I feel like part of it is just the fear of dating someone in all honesty, and my brain’s just finding any excuse I can not to move things forward rather than face the fear. I feel like I maybe have a tiny thing for her: last night for instance she was out and I wasn’t, and I could feel a tiny little bit of jealousy seeing her with other guys and wondering if she’d make out with them or anything. Like that wouldn’t happen if there wasn’t SOMETHING there. But it’s not like I’m head over heels for this girl like I have been for people in the past.

I just really don’t know what to do. I mean I suppose I’m young, dating doesn’t have to be so serious, and I can always take things slow. But I’m just not sure about starting anything romantic with someone I’m not 100% sold on, even if they are as hot as she is. So, what should I do here? Is it okay to date someone when you don’t get that feeling in your stomach about them, or would it be an asshole move and be like leading her on? I don’t want to hurt her feelings, but at the same time I feel like it could really be a good learning experience for me at the very least, one that I really need to get over with at some point, and at the best it could maybe turn into something more if I give it a chance. I just don’t know what’s best.",10Mar2019,1
