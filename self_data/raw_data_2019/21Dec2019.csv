0,"I've had a shitter of a year, definitely the hardest of my (37 year) life, very unexpected, unpredictable and alien to me. I've ended the year with a shit load of regret for many many MANY reasons, some I can rectify, some I'm trying to, some are out of my control. 

I don't really do the 'new year, new me' thing, for one I've never had to, and two Jan 1st is just another day with a different number attached to it. But I really could be doing with my level head back in 2020. 

Good luck to you lot with whatever your purpose is for the new year. Take it easy :)",21Dec2019,1
1,"The title sounds more positive than it is... Honestly? Im worried. Really worried. I don't regret going on these meds- They kept me from killing myself during the worst period of my life. And 2 years on its maybe time to get off of them.

Aside from the fact that Im on a lower dose and I think I might be starting to feel the effects of that (Ive been... Much more paranoid lately, and Im pretty irritable I guess I just can't stop thinking about what if my brain is just broken and realistically I should be on these meds forever in order to not self destruct? Sure they've kept me alive but at what cost? I may not feel the lowest of lows... But I also don't feel the highest of highs. I can feel emotion for sure- But its the small stuff folks take for granted.  Sometimes I need to make myself laugh, even when I find things really funny. Its like I KNOW I should be laughing my ass off- But it just doesn't come. Or when you're listening to a REALLY good song and you're vibing with it... I don't feel the frission I used to feel. The same goes with movies or TV shows. I also feel less ambitious, and more placid all across the board. Its better than feeling like Im being crushed by the weight of my worlds... But only because numbness is better than pain.

I also suspect the empathy for others I used to feel, almost to a fault has eroded. But that could be from the shit Ive had to deal with that put me into a suicidal state... I don't know. But thats the point. I DONT KNOW. Sometimes I feel like I can't even trust my own feelings and emotions. Whats me? Whats the medication? Whats the mental illness?

What if I wean myself off but I find I cannot control my emotions again? Am I doomed to be chained to medication? To not feel the highest of highs I used to take for granted? At that point what worth is my own life? I have people I love and I don't want to go away for them... But what a sad and sorry state to live in where the only reason you don't kill yourself is because of the people you love? Im not miserable... But Im not happy. And Im afraid true happiness might be beyond my grasp. 

If the cost of survival is everything that makes life worth living why the fuck didn't I just follow through and kill myself?

NOTE: I know Im talking about suicide a lot here but before someone says it- No I am not a risk to myself. I have neither the will or the inclination to hurt myself. Im just worried about the cost of my continued existence. It feels like a warped genies wish.",21Dec2019,1

5," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ on email replies and said it in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. Sometimes she will ask me something related to jobs etc then when is she whatever is ya she will abruptly reply ‘did yer’ in what seems a snotty/sarcastic way 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

6,"Literally on the streets of Hong Kong and Macau for a month now. I'm from Canada but I have been living in mainland China for 2 years. 

Lately I've been living off of little savings I had, loans and people's generosity. I just can't get a visa back to China, there are so many problems. Every time I get over an obstacle, 10 more pop up. If i don't get approved for a visa on Monday (december 23), I will have to contact the embassy to get a flight back to Canada, then pay them off within 30 days. I don't even have anywhere to go in Canada and don't know what I could do there.. I left because I wanted to escape my boring life there.

7,"My boyfriend and I have been dating since 17, 31 f and 32m now. I can honestly say he’s my best friend and time has flown by because of all the fun. He does so much for me and has been there for me through two autoimmune disease diagnoses and all the troubles that come along with it. 

Long story short, it’s just always about me and I feel so horrible about it a lot. 

So he’s had shoulder pain since I’ve met him. He’s a big guy and I guess the pressure of sleeping on his sides just irritate him to no end and it compromises his sleep. 

I FINALLY FOUND A PILLOW THAT ALLEVIATES THE PRESSURE AND HE CAN SLEEP IN PEACE NOW.  


It’s called a medcline pillow. Shoulder pain. https://medcline.com/medclinelp/videos-and-media/

I couldn’t wait until christmas. I gave it right away. He was so happy. I was so happy for him. He would never think to buy something like this for himself. I used my Christmas bonus to buy it. 

I just wanted to share my happiness about being able to finally give back. (And also recommend a great product to anyone else with shoulder issues). 

Happy holidays y’all. Be good to each other.

Tl;dr: I was finally able to give back to my partner.",21Dec2019,1

14,I hate things about my physical appearance that I can't change for example my hair type. I naturally have a afro and my sister has a looser hair type. All the stuff I've been made fun of for example my academic capabilities growing up my sister was praised for. She's naturally smart got nothing below a 7 at gcses. Bruh the highest I got was a 6. Ended up drooping of a levels twice. Now I'm in college actually don't mind the course I'm doing and I go to the same place as my best mate. But I can't help and hate myself. My own fucking genetic makeup and my mind. Me and my sister came out the same woman yet I'm this disgusting self hating thing. While me sister is losing weight and hair goals.

15,"Lmfao so I got the funniest prank/Christmas gift idea ever. 

So I’m in the military, marine corps and I live with a roomate that sleeps like 2 feet away from me. We fuck with each other pretty often and it’s p fun. I’ve grown to go from “he’s just another person” to “hey maybe I give a shit about “this” person..?” 

I’m supposed to take him to the airport this upcoming Tuesday he’s gonna go home to his family while I’m staying here because well, I can’t go. 

I want to give him a present but as to keep with our usual “fucking with each other” theme, I want to give him a box of condo a wrapped in Christmas wrapping maybe with a bow on it. You know? Make him think it’s something else 

There’s a story behind the condoms. So while we’ve been here I’ve constantly gone out to other army bases/navy etc and uh gotten laid a few times. It’s come up with him because I’m bisexual so he was like “what the duck do you do all weekend? You’re never here” and I’m like “you don’t wanna know” and he’s like “you’re fucking other guys huh” so yeah and I’ve been like “my dude, you gotta get laid (I don’t think he has been been because he’s here 24/7) also I have a car and he doesn’t. So there’s that anyways he’s going back home so I’m like “you GOTTA get laid” lmao 

ok first question: thoughts on this? Is it too much? Tbh I think it’s just the perfect amount of fucking with him lamp 

Second question: HOW DO I BUY CONDOMS IN PERSON?!?! I always buy my condoms online but.. yeah I was gonna buy him one of those huge boxes of condoms that have liek 50 but there’s not enough time for amazon to deliver since he’s leaving in like 4 days?",21Dec2019,1

i’m in the worst state of mind ever. i hate myself. god i hate everything about me. i’m disgusted with every part of my body. i won’t even think about having s*x. what would my parents think about their own child doing disgusting things? they would absolutely never look at me the same. they could only think about their little baby and how they’ve been using their...private area. every person who has a “crush” on me is just playing with me. they can do so much better.

but the one thing i think about every day are my genitals and how replused i am to have them. i’m not worthy of having genitals. it sounds really weird, i know, but i have no other way of explaining it. i’ve had thoughts about literally just burning it off. i can’t even pee without being horrified with myself. every part of my body is gross. i don’t deserve love because of my private parts.

I'll end up deleting this post too either because of the reddit time limit or another bot will flag me down. I just want to talk for a while. Facebook doesn't care because my feed is nothing but political crap either in America or India. Tumblr is more focused on photography from a magazine. But here, it's also normal business stuff; noth in ng for my kind. 

The intention of this is not begging for pity. It's just a message in a bottle for someone. But I know I'll be ignored anyway. Just thought to try.

As if I cant get any lower. In this month alone, I've had brakes go out, been lied to by my own teacher on the final, had stuff stolen that I know I'll never get back and the thief will get away with the crime.

There are worse out there, and I'm just miniscule in comparison. It still hurts, it still hurts. I'm still depressed and angry. I'm still trying and failing to keep it together in the public eye. 

But who cares? I can never compare to the multiple orphans possibly thrown into the sex trade. I have no right to cry or scream when thousands of kids are crying as their parents beat them senseless over essentially nothing. Cant even kill myself when little Sarah is cold and alone in a war torn area where she is all too familiar with death.

I honestly can't imagine how someone could be happy. Life's just too hard. There's too much to be sad about. Too much to worry about. Not enough to be happy about. 

It seems like a person almost has to delude themself to be happy.

41,"19 M here, not on a throwaway, but screw it.  I had slight developmental differences from my classmates early on, but that later settled/consolidated into the category of ADHD and anxiety. I felt relatively on pace with my peers up until partially through middle school, when kids started really “dating” in earnest. I’m gay, but didn’t fully realize it at the time, and that didn’t really matter because I was too avoidant to form a romantic relationship with anyone. Besides, it was still just middle school, so it didn’t matter as much at the time. However, as I progressed through the grades, more and more of my friends fostered successful relationships while I remained isolated. It is now my first year in college and I have made absolutely no new friends on campus, let alone formed any romantic relationships. I don’t talk to anyone at college, and even when I get time off to meet up with my old friends, they don’t often have time for me, being too busy with their relationships and new friendships. I feel like an afterthought in people’s lives, and am too incompetent to do anything to improve the barren circumstances I have cultivated. I am a stupid, anxious, mess, bearing witness to the end of my residual friendships.

I've been disregarded and abused enough for one lifetime, and really, the only person who can stop that from happening, is me. I'm the person who accepts it, and let's it happen; and then when things hit the fan and I can't take it, I have no one to blame but myself.

I proved it with the old man, with [redacted], with a lot of my old friends; I can stop the cycle by just walking away.

The hardest thing is convincing yourself that there's a life beyond what you have now. All too often people sit in the situation they've made for themselves, and try to find a comfortable spot in the rosebush, saying ""things will get better"" if you can put up with the pain of twisting and contorting yourself to fit among the thorns.

You're both your own greatest enemy, and your greatest ally, in the effort to pursue happiness.

Right now, I'm in a situation where I feel unloved, unwanted, and living life like it's business; Obligated to feel happy for the success of others, a product of stepping on your hard work and earnest intentions.

I've been through harder times, I've made new friends before, and I can do it again.

46,"So I was on my bicycle riding home and I was in a pretty small road and riding on the left hand side of the road. And I wear glasses so a bug came onto my glasses and I was trying to get it off. Unknowingly I steered into the right hand side of the lane. I was still trying to get rid of the bug when a biker came and was driving towards me (he was driving on his left hand side and is correct and I was on the wrong side of the road) and he started yelling and swearing at me. I halted at the right hand side of the road to let him pass while looking in his eyes and getting sweared at. I pedalled home as fast as I could and im pretty scared and I started panicking. I know I'm at fault but why do I panic when in such a situation. Feels bad man. 

I'm 20 M and has been a quiet kid all my life. Never really got into arguements but was bullied in school. I know I'm at fault here suddenly steering into his lane but I feel so bad about getting yelled at like this. Am I weak willed? I want to man up but it just feels bad.",21Dec2019,1
47,"I’m autistic and I have difficulty talking to people and maintaining conversations, you know how you can be hanging with your friends and talk for hours straight, well I have difficulty talking for even half a minute unless I’m venting to them. 


I always felt like I was never truly part of any friend groups because of this, I never felt like anyones best friend, I always felt like the 9th wheel, not even the third one, I needed love and affection, which is what I believe lead me to be obsessed with relationships, my years of always feeling like the least popular friend in my friend groups lead me to be obsessive with getting attention

When I got to high school I was the only person from my school that went there, I’m a junior in hs now, I didn’t know how to make friends, I thought that friend groups were exclusionary and hostile towards outsiders, and that you’d only be allowed to hang out with them if you befriend one of the members and that member invites you to hang out with them and then they come to consensus on whether or not you can hang out with them, so I tried to socialize with people, but due to my lack of social skills, hobbies, and interests it took me from the first day of school august 9 to April 12, to find a friend group

I  found the friend group by just asking this girl if I can hang with her friends and she said yes to much my surprise, I was even more surprised by how kind and friendly they were

I had a strong aromantic crush on her, mesh for alterous attraction, and I felt lonely and anxious when away from her, I wanted to be around her, I didn’t even really care about dating her, I just liked her and I didn’t know why, 

later that year towards the middle of first semester of sophomore year I found out she’s bi, I thought she was lesbian or asexual before that, then in December I started trying to a ask people out which started my year long obsession with acquiring a relationship

During this time I became closer to her thanks to a spider, I was eating either red hots or hot tamales when a spider crawled towards me, I pushed the spider away and she commentated on it, I realized she was friendly and I sat next to her, before I wouldn’t sit closer than 5-10 feet away because I didn’t feel welcome 

So back to my obsession, I tried asking her friend out after my first rejection and she had a reaction to say the least, so I thought they were dating, I tried asking other people, but most of them I wasn’t able to ask out because they were already dating or not of an orientation that would be interested in me, by the time I asked her out in may she was the 3rd person to reject me, I asked 1 more before finishing sophomore year

Junior year I asked 2 more before asking her out again in October I think, after she rejected me I asked out 5 more people by December, then a year after my first rejection I changed my mindset and am now focusing on friendships, I’m focusing on engaging on hobbies and interests, you can read my post on r/offmychest  I know longer feel obsessed over acquiring a relationship

53,"I’ve just been browsing reddit for a while and had a thought about how extreme some people’s opinions are on here and how strong some opinions are among the vast majority, but in real life I’ve never heard anyone say something to that extent. Sometimes it’s stuff that leans to the left or sometimes it’s stuff that leans to the right, or racial things that are getting crazy amount of upvotes or things about certain features that make people attractive and so forth. It’s easy to get swayed by thinking maybe everyone thinks something is the case because of the amount of upvotes on it. But when I snap back to reality none of my acquaintances are even familiar with reddit. To be honest I’ve only had one friend ever speak of reddit and every social group I’ve been in at school has mentioned other social media platforms but Reddit has never come up once.


So if you’ve ever felt hurt by a comment on here it’s probably in your benefit to realize the world doesn’t think that’s the case.

55,"few months back I got diagnosed with GAD (Chronic Generalised Anxiety disorder). For those who don't know I can get anxious from almost anything, however what makes my anxiety different is that it stays for long periods of time. For example before writing a test or a exam its normal for someone to get a little anxious. In my case I get anxious before and after the test for many hours after. Or there are sometimes which causes days of feeling claustrophobic...

Anyways I have been going to gym everyday now and I can honestly say its changed my mental and physical life. I have never looked this good (like proper 6 pack sometimes 8 on a good day), defined back muscles, checker boards over ribs I am just so proud haha.

For anyone else who has GAD or has anxiety give gym a go. If you are shy because you can pick up 100kg on your first day DONT FEEL EMBARRASSED! Everyone had to start at the bottom. Heck I was struggling to bench 5KG and after 3 months i'm benching 25KG. Once you start seeing results you start wanting to improve, seeing how you can focus on different parts of your body. 

Obviously this may not help with everyone, but I hope it may work with someone else. I promise once you start seeing some results, many it be a single 2 pack, or 5KG weight loss you will feel great! You accomplished this YOURSELF no one else but you managed to do this!",21Dec2019,1

57,"TLDR: My life has been pretty shitty, and I've lacked any real human connection for my entire life. I don't know how to begin to make connections with others.


I doubt anyone will read this whole thing, and that's okay. It's far too long. I don't blame you. 

Where to start really... I'm a 20 year old male, and I've lived with depression for at least half that. I'm an only child, and I grew up with my mom who lived on disability, and she suffers with bipolar psychosis. I have been molested twice in my life, the first being when I was five by my dad (who I have never seen since), and the second being by a teenage boy when I was seven. I grew up having likely repressed those memories, and to this day I would say they don't effect me, but it's often brought up during any therapy. 

I first developed suicidal idealization, depression, and self esteem issues when I was ten years old. I had just moved schools, and in doing so lost my best and only real friend. I was put into a class with two teachers, one who turned out to be very nice, and one who destroyed my self image. Many times that year she mocked me, degraded me, and told me I was a disgrace in front of our entire class. I don't think I ever recovered from that.

I started off middle school with few friends, but friends nonetheless. Over the years however, I was put into classes with less and less of them, until grade eight where I was put with none. I would lose these friends permanently. My life would become far more solitude, I'd spend all my time playing video games, and in doing so gained enough weight to consider myself fat.

By the time highschool rolled around, my relationship with my mother had massively deteriorated. She accused me of terrible things every day, and caused terrible fights that to this day still haunt me. I began to skip classes... a lot. I skipped more classes than I attended in the first two years. I had no friends during high school. Not one. In grade 10 I would attempt suicide for the first time, as my depression had been getting exponentially worse every semester. My self image had developed to where I could no longer think of a single thing that I liked about myself. I refused to have pictures taken of me, and I avoided any social interaction. By mid grade 11, things had gotten so bad that I decided to drop out. 

Home life without going to school soon became a living nightmare. I did nothing, at all. I can not recall a single good memory from those years. Eventually my mom was put into a mental hospital after pointing a gun at a police officer, but that's too long a story to go over. During her stay in the hospital, I stayed with my grandma. Once she returned, I did as well. Things were better for a little bit, until she decided to get off of her medication. Things spiraled from there, and eventually one night I decided to attempt suicide once again. I had gone through the preparations, cleaning my room, throwing out the trash, but all I had was razor blades. By the time I was ready, it was 5am, and I realized I was too tired to do it. I went to bed thinking, perhaps things will get better.

The next morning I am awoken by my obviously enraged mom. She told me she knew that I had thrown away her things. To clarify, she had constantly accused me of throwing away or purposely damaging her items many times before. Turns out, while throwing out my stuff, some of her things had been in my room. She actually went outside to the dumpster, dove in it, and searched through my bag. She kicked me out. Since then, I have been living with my grandma. Things have been better. A lot better. I began exercising, I got a job as a Software Engineer (I've always been really good with computers &amp; programming), and I got my license. 

But I feel so empty. I feel so alone. I crave companionship, but I'm too scared to put myself out there. I've been told many times in my life that I'm extremely ugly. I have rosacea, which makes my face really red almost all of the time, ESPECIALLY when I'm nervous. I feel so socially limited, like I'm a fucking alien. I'm pretty good at talking to people, emphasizing with them, but no one ever makes connections with me. No one ever goes out of their way to talk to me. And I absolutely do not go out of my way to talk to others. I get that sometimes you have to go out of your way to talk to others to make friends, but that doesn't explain why NO ONE has ever wanted to do the same with me? How do I become a person that people want to connect with?",21Dec2019,1

61,"For a few years now, I’ve become very aware of the language my mind speaks to itself. The language is so comprehensive and consistent, that I can’t deny that it actually might be something my subconscious has either picked up or has always known. Like it’s the sound of my mind processing specific information. It sounds like it has Russian undertones but is also very whispery and almost robotic in some ways. Usually I have very consistent words, and the words usually follow patterns in my behavior versus identifying specific things. My mind will repeat specific words when I’m in states of stress, joy, wonder, being busy, etc.. Every action I take has a very specific word. 
Sometimes it feels like it’s the language I developed before I learned how to speak. Action oriented vs object. 

Also, no I have never been diagnosed with any kind of mental illness and don’t experience symptoms of anything. 
I’ve always wanted to ask Reddit about this because I’ve searched for threads about it but can’t find anything.

75,"I know I just need to get thicker skin and stop giving a shit, but it seems like everywhere I turn someone has made arbitrary rules for women that I'm expected to live by. I'm fairly feminine, I dress feminine and have typically feminine hobbies like crafts, crocheting, painting my nails but I have several typically masculine interests and hobbies as well, and it rarely goes well for me. I'm immediately held to a higher standard and just assumed to be incapable. ""Name five x then if you're so into it"" is a real thing. Or being mansplained over, because of course it's assumed I don't know as much. 

And then there's the shit that'd just needlessly gendered. Why is taking care of my damn self and learning to do maintenence on a car and around a house, use power tools, protect myself etc alllll considered masculine? It's just exhausting. It's been making so angry lately because I'm either seeing it more and more or I'm becoming more aware of it. Even people in the writing community can be sexist, WRITING! I get why women wrote under male pseudonyms back in the day, for fuck's sake. 

I do enjoy some stereotypical aspects of feminity and the fact that I *can* enjoy them without facing the backlash men do. But goddamn, why can't I paint my nails AND like guns without it being a thing? Why can't I go into trades or manual labor jobs and be respected, not constantly doubted and having to prove myself more than anyone else simply because I'm female? Why can't I take care of my own shit like yard work without some rando dude saying I need a man to do it for me? Why can't I say I like baseball without being questioned and asked to confirm or deny random obscure facts? Why can't I play a video game - even down to fucking online Scrabble and Draw Something - without being literally *harassed* in every other game because my username or picture shows I'm a girl? That alone has about driven me to insanity, it's so unnecessary to go out of your way to make lewd comments to women on a fucking word game. This has happened over and over and over to the point I had to change my name from ""cat mom"" to something more ambiguous, which I never should've had to do.

This shit is the reason I've always hated being a girl and have just come to embrace some aspects of feminity within the past few years. Growing up, I was constantly taught (both by family and tv/movies and the world in general) that girls were weaker and feminity was soft and dumb, but you also had to be feminine because that was the card you were dealt, which ruled out many of my interests and made me jaded and rife with internal misogyny at the ripe age of 8.

It's just so tiring to be constantly aware of what I'm doing and how I may be judged on it. I go through waves of this, with any luck I will go back to not caring in a couple weeks. But right now my exposure to criticism is fairly limited - I don't work or have friends or date. Once I start doing those things, I feel like it's only going to get worse. Why can't people just let me live??",21Dec2019,1

I feel hollow

I feel worthless

How do I get feeling better?


I already eat healthy and sleep well. I exercise every day for 40 minutes, even on these days where I feel like nothing.

77,"I am only 18, and have had severe leg pain on my right leg. It is impacting my life in every way possible. It started about 6 months ago, as a sort of nerve pain going down from my right hip to my toes (sciatica). However, about 2 months in, the shooting pain stopped, and now it is isolated severe pain on my hip, and my calf. My calf gets really tight and it hurts a lot as well. I cannot walk more than 500 meters without the pain level reaching about an 8 or 9 out of 10. I have been diagnosed with sciatica, although I am not sure I believe that as there is no shooting pain. I had the following tests done, all coming out normal:

Blood test for auto immune diseases, xray on lumbar spine and hip, blood pulse on foot, check for muscle loss, different stretches, reflexes.

I have been stretching for some time now. It is worth mentioning, sometimes throughout the 6 months, I can feel the pain in my left leg as a mild shooting pain as well. Also, 2 months in, I took about 3 tablets of 50 mg each 5-htp supplements. This is also when the pain changed from a shooting pain to isolated pain. I am assuming that 5-htp had nothing to do with it, but your opinion would be helpful.  Please, any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",21Dec2019,1
79,"I had tried every trap possible and cleaned every surface, but nothing seemed to help. Next thing I know, boom, cold weather hit

I tend to ""run hot"" (i.e. I'm always overheated for some reason, probably just my high metabolism), so I appreciate cold weather. The last few weeks, it's been pretty cold where I live. Like 20 degrees Fahrenheit on average

Because I'm insane, I've capitalized on this cold weather by essentially turning my house into a refrigerator by keeping all of the windows open so that I can peacefully sleep with a heavy blanket like a comforter and wear cozy clothes around the house rather than just a t shirt and underwear or going full nudist. It's nice to wear hoodies and whatnot, I just like it. And everyone knows comforters are better than sheets or having no blanket at all

Well, I just realized I haven't seen a fruit fly in like two weeks. At first I was confused because I pretty much gave up on trying to kill them, but then I realized it must have obviously been the cold because what else could it have been?

Now I'm just that much less upset about how I start sweating after simply standing inside of a grocery store for longer than 3 minutes. My weird and insane body has saved the day 

Fuck fruit flies

80,"I have spent the past 13 years feeling like the worst mother. Yet I have the best child on earth. I know I sound biased but he really is great. He’s loving, kind, never gets angry, smart, mature and honestly all the things you could want in a child. I got lucky. Especially for how young I had him. 

But I know this could all change and even though I have this great kid I have beat myself up thinking that I am the worst mother. I am riddled with self doubt, mental illness and suicidal tendencies. I’m bad with money. I make crap decisions all the time. But I TRY to do better. Even when I don’t have it in me and I want out. I try. It’s hard. 

But this is when I’ve accepted the reality that is being a parent. We weren’t born parents. We don’t magically lose all of our problems when we become parents. We have this idea that we need to be these almost godlike creatures so that we look like saints among parents. It’s false! Stop thinking that way! 

My father did this when he was alive. I hated it. I wanted him to be more of a “father archetype”. The Leave it to Beaver type of dad. But he never was. He was so real and so true to himself. He was a good father because he strives to be a good person. He didn’t hide any of his problems. He just spent his life accepting his “flaws” and problems and tried to evolve past them. But my father realized he was a man with all of these problems who just happen to have a kid. 

So I’ve now accepted that same philosophy. I’m not a magical being who is now above all my problems because I have a kid. I’m a human who has depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder and PTSD who just also happens to have a kid. I don’t want to hide who I am from the world or from my kid because I’m afraid people will think I am a bad mother. No. I am person who is trying to be a good person to everyone around me and to myself. I’m hoping my son sees that and realizes that not everyone is perfect. Not even his mom. That even with all of her problems everyday she chose to wake up, go to work, take care of her issues. Live in the anxiety of not knowing how she’s going to pay her rent. That month to month was a gift. A woman who can’t even get out of bed most days and wants to die but gets up and takes her son out to eat once a week because I save up to treat my son to a nice lunch every week. 

I want him to know that she works 2 jobs, goes to school full time, cries every single night because she feels so alone. She has no family, no friends and yet she pushes on and sees a therapist, takes medication and finds reasons to be alive when the only reason is her son. 

So if you feel like a bad parent you are not. Unless you abandon your child abuse your child you are a good parent. No matter what your problem might be whether it’s drugs, alcohol, trauma, depression, or whatever it is, you are a good parent for trying to be better everyday. As long as you are trying even if everyday you fail you are a good parent because you are setting up an example to your children that will last a lifetime. The example being that we are not perfect. We are all human and as long as we try every single day and never give up then that means you are a fighter. If your child can see that they can learn from your examples and be better than we were. 

I’ve accepted myself as a mother. I will not hide who I am from the world.",21Dec2019,1

Well, that’s how I’m feeling right now.

I’ve been given or gifted multiple headphones over the last five years.

I’m not talking about little iPhone headphones or air pods, but those Bluetooth noise canceling ones, different brands, pretty high quality ones. 

The most recent incident was this Thursday. I just so happened to get the drawing for some fancy Sony ones at my most recent work related holiday party. 

The irony of it, I don’t even listen to music and I’m a teacher, it’s not like I can sit in a cubicle and listen to music while cancelling out the noise around me. 

I literally have no use for them, but the universe keeps throwing them at me and each time I give them to my SO who actually listens to music and wants to tune out his coworkers. 

I’m not religious or anything, but is this a sign? If so what for? Why me? Why headphones?

85,"It was a tough year for me. I lost someone I loved for years, my mental health got the best of me, and I lost myself. There would be multiple days a week I wouldn't leave my apartment. I started to go to therapy, which was nice, but it dug up painful memories that I didn't know I had. I was alone. I felt alone. 

I had a rough childhood, which led to horrible teenage years, which led to me wanting to quit life early. Somehow I made it this far and I'm going to do my best to keep fighting. 2020 is a new decade and I'm going to treat it as such. I've learned a lot over the years and now it's time to start sharing what I know with those around me. 

I don't post on Reddit that much (in fact, I only have one post apart from this), but I might start to do it more and share more of who I am. I have a big heart that has a lot of love for a lot of people, but I'm always terrified to say anything. If anyone reading this needs someone to vent to or to just listen, my ears are always open. I strongly believe that each individual is beautiful in their own way and deserves love. Let's make this new decade the best one yet and start to move towards loving and caring about those around us.

For a lot of time I have avoided most of the swear words. I hate to use them (especially that one of course), mostly because I wouldn't consider myself a civil person if I did. Many times I have tried to let others know how much swearing bothers me, but with no effects.

91,"When I was young, my 2 older brothers played tons of games and they were both very into Pokémon. I couldn’t quite understand why they loved it so much so I tried it on the Gameboy. 

I would always gravitate towards the fire Pokémon as my starter and leveled that one up first. I couldn’t get past the 3rd gym because I would be quite confused on where to go and how to get the items I needed. So I would stop playing because I gave up. 

Many years later, Let’s Go Pokémon Pikachu and Eevee came out and my brothers were all for it. I found the visuals quite neat and different — my sort of style. The game itself looked cute but still quite confusing as I watched them play it. They finished the game pretty quickly and stopped playing on the switch.

So when Pokémon Sword and Shield came out, it piqued my interest a bit. My friends would go on about how fun it is and seeing those huge Pokémon was neat. However, 2 things caught my eye and that was the cooking and the shopping/customization. Being able to interact and cook for your Pokémon made me happy and to buy nice clothes and change the way your character looks is so much fun. 

Since I never ever touched the switch, I had a hard time getting used to it. It was an odd console for me to play with but fiddling around with it while playing Let’s Go Pokémon Eevee as practice, I was actually disappointed in that game. I was sad that they took out the fun part about Pokémon. Battling and catching them! I didn’t get too far as Pokémon Shield arrived to my house within a few days of purchase. 

Oh boy...once I started, I couldn’t stop. I was hooked. I was so immersed with the game and the storyline. Everything about it. The graphics, customization, the music, gym leaders, lots of new Pokémon that I never seen before and some familiar ones...it was all breathtaking honestly. This game fulfilled my heart as the old Pokémon games did with my brothers. I’m so happy that I can finally relate to them on some sort of level and that they’re teaching me things that I now find important. Stats, nature, abilities, and items. I already felt so happy with that! 

However, when I saw ‘The End’ I cried. I can finally say that I have finished a game of Pokémon and this game has been the most beautiful and breathtaking game I’ve played. 

There’s so much for me to do in this game and I’m still so excited!!! As my starter Pokémon, there’s this fire burning within me to catch all the Pokémon and to do my best to also buy out every single clothing item there is in this game.",21Dec2019,1

93,"I'm 25 and about to finish college. Some shit happened in my first year of college that made me do this whole blur of years in my life that included dropping out of school, lying to my parents about it for a year, my mom finding out in this fight-turned-we-both-cry-what-the-fuck-is-happening cathartic moment, which led to me going into therapy and enrolling in community college, then transferring to a really amazing school, from which I graduate in a term. 

&amp;#x200B;

Insert flood of anxiety, questions about what to do next, etc here (From 19-25 consisted of just diagnosis after diagnosis of what could be wrong with me), and now I have somewhat of a grasp on my own mental health (I'm a psych major, go figure). I still have anxiety from what is to come next, as well as my mom bringing up internships (and my lack of any) on a daily basis (since it's winter break and I'm currently home). I understand where she is coming from, and am not criticizing her in any way, my mom is actually amazing and my biggest supporter, but the questions don't help, considering I'm currently in the dark place.

95,"Hey Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

So I wanted to talk about this annoying thing that I have no doubt others have dealt with, or are still dealing with, as well. I'm not asking for someone here to help me fix the problem - that is far above Reddit's paygrade, and I should talk to a therapist about it. I'm just looking for a connection with people who have experienced/are experiencing something similar. 

&amp;#x200B;

Objectively, I'm not doing badly in ""the game of life"" (and yes, I hate that I think of life that way, but it's honest, so I'm sticking to it). I'm not doing great (according to my own standards), but I'm definitely not doing bad. I have recently completed a master's degree and have worked really hard on myself. I used to have frequent panic attacks and blackouts, especially during any kind of test/evaluation-situation. I've made great progress on that front. I moved to a different country to pursue my bachelor's and traveled all over for my master's. I now have a group of friends I can call family, and I'm in a great relationship. I'm working towards building my career (which feels slow), but in the meantime, I've got a nice in-between job. While the work itself is dull, I genuinely like my colleagues. I've also signed up for a Data Analytics Bootcamp which will start soon. Basically, I'm hungry for life and I'm hungry to learn and improve. Writing this all out, I feel like an idiot for not feeling great about it all, but there's this inner voice that keeps reminding me of all the things I have not achieved (yet). This is where the comparison kicks in, especially with one specific ex-boyfriend:

&amp;#x200B;

He played the uni/youth-political game very successfully, was super active in all kinds of student organizations and clubs, is now a part-time researcher while working at a well-established company as well. Everything he does feels better, and I feel like I'm still living in his shadow. When we first met, we both fell hard and fast, and he became my whole world (not helped by the fact that I had just moved to a different country and was, for the first time ever, truly independent). I hate that I was that dependent, and I have this idea in my head that he used to see/sees me as inferior (most likely projection). 

Apart from that, I just constantly compare myself to my peers on LinkedIn and with alumni and friends. I am tired of it. I am tired of always feeling inferior, I am tired of never feeling satisfied. I've heard of the "" don't compare yourself to others, but compare yourself to yourself from yesterday,"" but that feels ... unsatisfying.

101,"At the start of the year I was doing terribly. My brother was killed by a driver with road rage about 2 years ago and we are still going through the court proceedings. My job was incredibly stressful and not understanding of my circumstances and I could not handle it so I rage quit. While unemployed, my husband became abusive, so I was then going through a divorce at 24. I got a part time, low stress, job to make ends meet but I felt like I was a failure because I was no longer in a career position, divorced, had no money, and was living with my mom. In October I interviewed for my dream job at a very good company, way less stressful than my overwhelming job, and a lot more money. And I got it! 

Last week, after an incredibly long background check, I started my new job. In January I will be moving into my very own apartment with my doggies, and l am just so happy. It’s been such a hard year for me and I felt like my life was falling apart. I’m still going through the court proceedings but I feel like mentally I’m finally strong enough.

I’m proud of myself for picking myself up at rock bottom and not settling.

102,"Dear Esther,

You’ll probably never read this. This probably won’t leave my computer. That’s okay. This is more for me than for you, anyways. At least I think so. But I never know with you.

I don’t even know where to begin, or even what to say. There are just so many negative, debilitating thoughts within me at this moment. I can’t stop feeling cheated, used, misled, played with. I feel so angry, so hateful – I’ve never felt this way before. It’s probably not healthy. And I feel this way, right now, because I cared that much for you. I really liked you. I did. You always made my day and I couldn’t wait for the day to end so we could spend our time together. Your smile was gorgeous, your laugh was heartwarming – you made each and every one of my days.

So what happened? I don’t know. You won’t tell me. And I’m so angry, so confused, so hurt. I let myself fall for you, I let myself believe in us – only for you to turn your back on me. Who was I ever to you? What did I ever mean to you? What were our past few months? Were you ever really happy with me? What changed? Was it me, or you, or both of us? Why did it have to end like this?

We always talked about the first time we met. It was sometime in spring, and Michelle had introduced me to you. Our first interaction? A quiet hello.

I don’t think we met met though, until later in the year. I remember I was running late, and I saw you while I was feverishly biking. I stopped, just for a minute, to acknowledge you. You stopped, too. We exchanged a knowing look and started the fall. Together.

You would always ask me interesting questions to keep my attention. I always found that a bit weird. In retrospect, it’s clear you wanted to be with me. And I guess, at some point, I wanted to be with you too. It was fun. It was enjoyable. And you, you were great.

You sent me plenty of signals those first few months. I’m sorry I didn’t pick up on them too quickly. Or maybe you didn’t mean to send signals at all. I don’t know. You took me to dinner not once, but twice, we went to the public library together, we would walk in the rain and talk about our problems, we watched movies together. At the time, I was so stressed with life, I wasn’t really thinking about a relationship.

But I think something changed once fall was over, and most of my stress evaporated. You were starting to be more than just a friend. And the development was gradual, until, at some point, perhaps that point on the last day of November, when you hugged me, that I realized: I really like you. I really do. I tried not to fall for you, but you were just so cute, so pretty, how could I not?

But now, looking back, I just feel so stupid. All these times, all these memories that mean so much to me, maybe don’t mean that much to you. Maybe I was just another guy to you. Maybe I was just someone you could use, someone’s attention you could draw. I don’t know. I don’t know anything about you anymore. I once thought I knew you well. But not anymore. I feel like I’ve never known you. I feel like everything we did, everything you meant to me, it was all a fabrication – one big lie, one big trick you played on me.

Who did I fall for? Or is it more apt to ask, what did I fall for? Because the girl that rejected me that Tuesday, I don’t think that’s the Esther I knew. Perhaps I had fallen for an image of you, perhaps I had fallen for my imagination, the idea of you, more than the real you. Maybe that’s what made you run away – maybe you felt I didn’t appreciate you. And I’m sorry if that’s true. I’m sorry.

I’m going to be honest – I wasn’t expecting a yes that Tuesday. I knew, considering my luck, there was a high chance this was not going to go well. I had also noticed how coldly you were being to me for the past few days, and especially that Tuesday. When you told me if I could do something else in the morning, it crushed me. When you constantly gave me creeped-out looks all lunch, a part of me died. But you know, I still wanted to give it a shot. My judgement isn’t known to be very good.

I wasn’t expecting a yes. But I certainly wasn’t expecting what you told me. I don’t think anybody did, except for you. And it hurt. It hurt a lot. It hurt a ton. I tried my best to act happy or kept together in front of you, but the moment you left me, the moment you told me “see you” and I responded “goodbye,” I broke down. I broke down in the snow, quietly sobbing into an abyss that was never going to respond, lamenting an experience I would never get to have.

Dear Esther, I don’t know why I’m writing this. I don’t know why I’m writing this to you. That’s a little creepy, maybe, probably. But I really needed to get this off my chest. If you really don’t like me anymore, and like someone else more, and I was never more than the second guy, and if you decided to choose him over me – I need to move on. Perhaps, one day, I’ll look back at this – and laugh at the immaturity of love, the melodrama of my emotions. But, right now, I’m struggling. I’m struggling a lot. I already miss you. This all hurts. This all sucks.

As much as I hate you right now, as much as I detest you for using me, leading me on, I still like you as much. Because you meant the world to me, the past few weeks.

But now that world is gone, and I’ve dropped to rock bottom.

That’s okay, I guess. I’ll make it back up. I always do.

You told me, right? You told me, the Monday before, that everything will be okay. Everything will work out.

If nothing else, I’ll believe that that Monday, those words, they weren’t lies – you really meant them. I think, at the very least, I can believe you on that.

Because, if even those words are lies, I don’t know what I would do.

Good bye, Esther. Thank you.

With love.

105,"While at work yesterday I received direct approval from my manager to be out of the office today. Later in the evening, the manager on duty (someone who has no managerial power over me and who I do not report to in any capacity) texted me and said I was required to come in. 

Not only did I stick to my guns and tell him I was already approved by our mutual Sales Manager, I didn’t apologize or explain myself. As a female  I tend to find myself saying “I’m sorry” or offering up personal information as to justify my actions in the professional environment.

I ended up doing the chat but it only lasted less than 30 minutes and once we ended the call he send me a long paragraph saying that he could viral my video, but he wouldn't because I seemed like a good person. I feel very unsafe, and I know that what I did was wrong and it clearly came with consequences. WHAT DO I DO??

115,"Well, it's pretty obvious that i'm completely introverted. I love being alone most of the time. It's not that i'm shy, which i also am, but much less. I mean, i have no problem talking with someone I don't know if we are just the 2 of us. in groups its worse.

My point is, that sometimes I just don't want to be with people, and it's not that i haven't got friends or that they treat me wrong. I love having them, and I would feel so lost without them. But there are periods of time that I want to be alone and there are some fears that I have.

I don't know if I can have a relationship. I had a girlfriend, and we spent loads of time together, and it finished off so wrong. It was really hard for me to recover. Is there actually a way in which I could? Relationship require a trust of being always with the other that I think I cannot provide. In fact that also applies to any relation.

And, could it be bad for me, not socializing for long periods of time? Nowadays I life with my family, but there could be a day in which I don't and that could make some serious problems show up. I could not talk to anybody for weeks and could be falling in my own trap.

I'm not sure if I explained myself well.",21Dec2019,1
116,"I'm a black woman and wear my hair natural. I absolutely admit and know that when my hair is straight and long, I transform into another person. I see it myself. I look STUNNING. Suddenly, people pay more attention to me. I get way more compliments. Heads turn. I actually see this and it's not some sort of seeing what I want to see thing. I get men hitting on me. People just seem nicer to me in general. It's clear. I look so much better and more of what society deems as pretty with long straight hair. 

But ***I*** love my natural hair. I love the texture. I love my tight curls. I love how strong it is. I think I look good. But it's clear that compliments completely disappear when I have natural hair. Nobody EVER compliments my hair. Not one person. Not even other black people. I have always loved my hair. And ever since I was a little girl I spent years going through different hairstyles. From braids, to weaves, to perms, to relaxers. I've done it all. And one thing that I can conclude is that I love my hair exactly the way it grows out of my scalp. 

Sometimes I wonder... will I regret wearing my hair natural and not being society's definition of beautiful when I get old? I honestly sometimes wonder if I'm wasting my time. Yes, I like my hair, but I also want people to think I'm pretty. I think I'm pretty, but it would be nice to turn heads. I'm always going back and forth in my head with this.",21Dec2019,1

the charge is a check fraud charge and it is a seven month sentence. My daughter she seems to be handling it fine. I told her right away about it and she reacted pretty calmly. I told her mom did the wrong thing and is rightfully serving her punishment. They have a good relationship.
The main problem I have is she will see her mom in a jail jumpsuit and see guards and other inmates that could be intimidating. Is that ok for a 15 year old to see? Actually my daughter does not seem scared but instead seems excited and enthusiastic to visit. This is strange to me. Do you find this normal? My daughter seems to find the idea of her mom having to wearing a uniform, sharing a room funny. I wonder why she would think it is funny.

120,"This happened two years ago.
Life was going pretty well for me. I was studying at the uni I dreamed of and found a bunch of new friends. This uni has a small exchange program (outside of ERASMUS) where foreign students would come to study with us for a year and after that we would go to their uni for another year.

I met the newe exchange students and we started hanging out a lot. Two of the girls were good looking and had genuinely nice personality. One of them was off limits because she had a boyfriend and I thought the other was out of my league.

Christmas rolled around, so I went back to my family for a few weeks. When I got back to uni, I started to feel really down. I neglected everything and suicide came to my mind. To this day I am puzzled what started this first depressive episode.

At the time I didn’t know it was depression. After a week I talked to my parents and thought of a plan to pull myself out of this hole.

It worked. It was at this time that I started doing more and more with the girl I thought of as out of my league. She was pretty flirty but it took me a long time to take the hint.

One day, two months later, we finally went on a date and kissed.
This was when things got complicated. Spring break was just around the corner. This meant she would have  to go back to her family in another country and I would have to go home too. She was scared one of us wouldn’t feel the same way about us when he or she got back and she didn’t want to be hurt. However, I convinced her that we crossed the red line, that I thought I loved her ( she said she felt the same way) and that we should at least try.  After a little bit of this discussion she agreed.

During the two months  of spring break we texted almost every day and managed to meet for a week after one month. It was nice but also weird because she was still very unsure about how this would work out after another month.

The second month passed aswell and we met again. That evening she confessed to me, that she was to scared of a relationship to carry on. She said I was a great, even the best guy she had been with, but that she was just to scared of getting hurt. She was also sure that she would regret that decision later. However she didn’t want to lose me completely and suggested staying friends. This had worked out for me once before, so I agreed to that proposal. 

For one month, things were pretty arkward between us. I still wanted more and she went back to flirty mode. At some point I couldn’t bare it anymore. I confronted her about it but she just repeated what she had said before. So I decides to leave the burning ship. I tried to cut her out of my life. But due to us studying the same thing and having common friends, this was very difficult. Everytime we saw each other, she gave me this really sad puppy-look. She even wrote me a letter, repeating herself once again.

Eventually we started talking again. We spent a day together, had the same old discussions but at the end I admitted defeat and tried to be her friend again.
I hoped that maybe she would get over her fears when we would be home at her uni in a few months, where she would have her friends and family (who she missed dearly) around her.

Life went on, she kept my hopes alive and after a few months the time for my year abroad had come.

I was really excited. A new uni, a new country and maybe I would get to be with her.

But when I arrived she dropped me. I wasn’t important anymore. She would get upset if I did things without her but never included me in her plans and her flirty attitude was gone.

Now my depression kicked back in. I completely isolated and neglected myself. I didn’t leave my dorm room, skipped classes and suicidal thoughts were my only companion.
When I flew home for christmas I had made up a plan to kill myself. 

Luckily I called the suicide hotline the day before my flight back to uni was scheduled. I went to the doctor and a few days later I got hospitalized.

After three months in the psychiatry, I got myself back on track. 
I took a break from studying, spent the summer at my parents house and planned my return to uni in autumn. 
Everything seemed great again.

In september, one month before the new semester started, I moved back to the town my uni was in.
I started organizing and cought up with some friends. Sadly most of them were out of town.
My days grew more and more boring because I had nothing to do. My old demons cought up with me. 
At night I couldn’t sleep so I started drinking to help me sleep and forget the thoughts I knew too well. One day it got to much. I downed a bottle of vodka and ordered a rope to hang myself online.
I don’t know why but I texted my best friend an told him what was going on. He alerted my parents who ordered an ambulance which took me to the psychiatry.

This is were I still am. Therapy helps and I regained a little bit of hope.

125,"I've wanted to post this for a while now. This seemed like the best sub for it.

All my life, even before I suffered childhood abuse by a narcissist, I always knew this world wasn't the real one. I was very bright, going on about brain waves, time travel, and space exploration when I was 5 years old, in a capacity far greater than the common ""I wanna be a astronaut, Mommy.""  I was spouting scientific hypotheses when most kids were learning how to tie their shoes. I looked at myself in the mirror, and at the world around me, and my brain never recognized any of it as ""real."" Still doesn't. Before you ask, no, I've never been diagnosed with anything beyond the fact that I'm a Highly Sensitive Person, and am perfectly sane. (I think.)

My ""inner world,"" if you want to call it that, wasn't just some coping mechanism I used against my abuse. It is the only place that has ever felt truly real to me. It's home. Earth pales weakly in comparison.

The internet is littered with social media posts in which people refer to their inner world as ""fantasy"" or ""imaginary,"" which is truly disheartening to me, and many philosophies would consider such terms wholly incorrect when applied to the soul's reality. For that is what dreams, movies, books, and musings are: reality. Another reality, yes, but one I've never considered any less real than the third rock from the Sun. Literally.

Am I really the only one who thinks this?

126,"At first I really needed the money for medical bills. Once I paid those off, then I told myself that I needed to continue to pay off my loans. Not too long ago, I sat down and came to the conclusion that I have to stop making excuses: I love my job a lot, and that’s the only reason why I do it at this point. It makes me happy. I’m SIGNIFICANTLY happier than I have been for the past two years just studying and dealing with other issues. I feel so brave and strong.

I’m extremely afraid of what my parents, friends, etc might think if they found out. I worry about a professional future. I wish people were more progressive. I wish it could ever be okay for me to be a sex worker and also pursue the high-profile career I want. I feel like I ruined my chances and this will pop up and my career will be ruined... I also look at people like Melania Trump, whose ‘unprofessional’ magazine photos came out and yet are still doing (relatively.....) fine. I don’t know. I’m just scared, but I’m so happy.

127," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ on email replies and said it in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. Sometimes she will ask me something related to jobs etc then when is she whatever is ya she will abruptly reply ‘did yer’ in what seems a snotty/sarcastic way 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?
