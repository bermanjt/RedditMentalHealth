So at this point, I'm not sure *how long* it takes for the gas/belching symptoms to go away after a meal. I keep getting fucked up in my self-tests with different foods because I'm not *sure*, I'm not *entirely sure*, if the gas/belching is from *that meal* or from a *previous meal*, or from the previous *day*, etc; or a combination of all of those. The only way I'd really be able to tell? —Starve myself (""fast"") for a certain amount of time. Basically, how long would it take for those SIBO bacteria to eat *all* the food that's in my upper (/lower?) intestine. People out here saying the AIP diet should be followed for at least a couple weeks to see if symptoms go down…but that's what I was *doing*. I was *doing* the AIP diet for like *three* weeks, and noticing that the onions still triggered me. That's why I'm here. That's why I'm creating this post and getting stuff down about self-testing.

Okay…so…logically. The SIBO bacteria feed on food. Is it *possible* that the SIBO bacteria feed on stuff like *meat* and *carrots*, which are *supposed* to be cleared for both protocols?? Look, I'm no bacteriologist. I'd *heard* that definitely meat was supposed to be clear and perfectly fine regardless; like it's the one *good* thing, the one light-in-the-tunnel, that's supposed to be worry-free. *But*, every time I've tried to eat that beef-heart stew, it's made me belch. Or I *think* it's made me belch; again, I can't be sure if I'm triggering gas that was already built-up in previous meals and waiting to be let out. I can hypothesize, but I can't be *sure*.

Okay. Meat is the one thing. Inarguably. So, … also, some people report problems with *beef* as opposed to chicken, for example, so maybe I should go for chicken first. I should starve myself for a solid day (WITH TEA) or longer, and *then* just go into *just straight up* chicken and salt. That's the plan. That'll be the plan.

Tea: *strong* ginger + turmeric. I should boil this myself from the root, so it's extra-strong. Also, I should be drinking salt-water thru the entire day, to make sure I get my electrolytes in at least.

The usual Drain-O effect with water will probably work for a while—it usually does in the morning, and right before lunch. How long should I do this for, though? Should I eat dinner *tonight*?

Well, if chicken's gonna be what I'm testing eventually (in a couple days or whenever I start eating again) (JEEZ I'm STILL burping from that meal ugh wtf I need to solve this), then maybe I should just have straight chicken tonight as well. No oil. No chives. Just some salt. And water. And that's it; call it a night. And THEN start fasting tomorrow…with the tea. Right; the tea—I should buy some ginger and turmeric root while I'm here. Maybe a mug, too? Nah I can just drink straight out of the pan.

So, assumedly, that'll all get out of my system by…when??? Who knows when???  
I think the hypothesis, though, here, is that if I'm drinking nothing but ginger-turmeric tea and saltwater all day, by day, the gas from the previous meal(s) will all get belched out of me by the drain-o effect, and I'll be able to *tell* when is the right time to start testing foods again. It might not even be until the next day…  
All of this is speculation. I won't know until I actually try it.  
However, IIRC, when I tried this same thing about a year ago and the last meal I'd had was oats, I went an *entire day* **still** belching from that meal, fasting or not. So maybe it *would* be wise to just aim for over a day. Heck, I could start right now. Why don't I start right now?? Lol I'll just have my tea tonight, like I was planning; and that's it. No use waiting around for this. Now is as good a time as ever. The only downside to starting it now is *potentially* 'going to sleep hungry' which might be hard, but in my recent experience if I just have tea or something hot like that it'll relieve my hunger and then my hunger will past, so it's kind of irrelevant. So I'll start the fast tonight. To be clear: I ate at (~)12:00noon today—or maybe it was 1:00—and it was just that meal of golden potatoes and tomatoes, slow-cooked in a lot of coconut oil and with some salt – and some chives (green; dried; the tips). So that's what I'm working off of. And *that*—*that* caused me…*some* gas; though I can't tell if it was releasing the previous day's gas or what. It didn't feel quite as 'heavy' in my stomach as the previous day's meal though; the plantains + onions &amp; garlic in coconut oil &amp; salt. That felt 'heavier' and caused me to start burping immediately *during* the meal—or, when I was like halfway thru with the meal, as opposed to the potatoes meal which caused me to start burping maybe, idk, when i was 3/4 or probably even all the way almost done. And it was just one long burp during the eating—as opposed to the onions meal, which was sets of four burps that occurred multiple times during the meal.

So. Plan.  
Ginger &amp; turmeric (fresh) from this store. Boil tea tonight. Boil tea tm; noon; dinner; etc. I'll keep doing that, plus my mineral salt + tap water, until *noon the **next** day—yes, how bout that—and noon the *next* day will be the chicken hearts. Just some chicken hearts, perhaps in a stew—no, or maybe, to make sure my stomach acids are all as strong as they can be, I'll fry them. Yum, those gonna be some *chewy* ass chicken hearts. Yum. But nothing else; just salt. NO OIL (either). Keep that up for dinner, too—marking what you feel. Then, I'll *probably* be hungry for breakfast the next day as well…so maybe chicken hearts again for a mid-morning meal. Just bang out this same thing; see how it makes you feel. God, if *this* doesn't solve things (and provide a ""safe"" meal), I'm not entirely sure what will—but if it doesn't, at least the main takeaway will be to find out how long it takes to 'clear' my system (of the previous food / so that the SIBO bacteria have nothing left to feed on / so that the gas is *all out*).

How long does it take to clear my system?  
And is chicken O.K.?  
Guess we're gonna find out.

I’m already depressed and this isn’t helping at all. I hate it, I’m trying really hard to stay positive and not descend into that pit but it feels like nothing I do is ever going to get me anywhere. How am I supposed to get experience if I need experience to get experience???

3,"My fiance (boyfriend) and I are one year into post grad life. My fiance is working as a financial adviser at a very small firm in our hometown, and I am working as an account manager at a very small ad agency in our home town. As you can imagine his salary is higher than mine by quite a bit, but I am able to earn uncapped commission.

As the one year anniversary of graduation approaches I'm finding myself in a position where I could be out earning him in the next six months, and I'm not really excited about it.

One reason is that he definitely worked harder in college in my opinion. There are some hard courses in marketing, but I STRUGGLED with intro finance.

The second reason is that I think it's sexy that he makes more. This has nothing to do with associating money with masculinity, I just like feeling helpless 😹

Thirdly I don't like the idea of being the ""breadwinner"". We could both live easily on just one of our salaries, but for the past year being the lower earning of the two of us I've felt like my income was supplementary.

He says since he handles all of our money anyway I can just have my paycheck deposited directly into his account if I don't want to feel like the breadwinner 😹",09Apr2019,0

6,"I miss my childhood. I mean I'm not very depressed abut it. I can carry on with my daily life and what not. So its not a big deal.

But, still it just doesn't feel right that I'm turning 24 this month. I know I'm still going to be a young man. Its just that I miss my childhood to the point that I've shed tears. (In private)

To cope and be able to function I have to believe in a crazy theory that the Universe goes through cycles. And, eventually I will be reborn in one repeating universe where I can be a kid again.

Its more than just missing those cool cartoons. Like Ed, Edd 'N Eddy, Codename: KND, Jonny Bravo, Dexter's Laboratory, and heck even the Power-puff Girls! Some of them come on late at night or at 2 am on Boomerrang. I still enjoy watching them every so often.

But, what I miss is the childhood magic. The **""aww""** factor feeling that you used to get on Christmas Eve or around Halloween time.

That magic is hard to find. But, if I do ""find"" it. It just doesn't feel the same.

The only hope I can find is in that crazy theory. Being Crazy, I don't think anyone commented on it.

I’d always had a feeling that said friend would talk about me, purely because of the way she would treat me and speak to me; but hearing it from someone else really hurt. Since then, I’ve really distanced myself from both of these “friends” and have been keeping to myself.

11,"So I'm currently a 16 year old and I am in my second semester of grade 11. Lifes been rough at home and last semester I almost got expelled because I was missing so much school due to anxiety / depression. I failed one class with a 30 and passed my three other classes all with 50's. Part of it was due to the fact that I've grown up my whole life with just my dad and my sister and my dad and I don't connect at all. We are complete opposites and he doesn't seem to care about me at all. I ended up staying home for a total of 1 month and had to talk to the principal and within that month not once did my dad ever ask me if I was okay or what was wrong. He would wake up every day and call me names and yell at me. He also threatened to kick me out twice saying that it was my fault that our family isn't functional. When I was at my lowest I was contemplating suicide but the thought of my sister dealing with that was too much and I couldn't ever do that to her. After a crazy night of me and my dad yelling at each other and me finally letting everything out about how he was the main reason I was so messed up he told me that it wasn't his fault and dodged me everytime I told him he was never there to care for me. I tried to make things better and besides the fighting every 1 - 2 weeks it was pretty okay, until I started missing school again. Not as much but ive missed about a week of days and it's been about 2 months. I went to my dad today and asked if he could maybe try homeschooling because getting up in the morning and anxiety at school was a huge problem for me and he told me right away ***no.*** He said that it's not normal to be home schooled and people that do aren't normal.

12,"Not sure what the point of this post is, maybe to finally air everything out, get advice or just get told it will be ok.  I don't know. But I have been struggling for months just to get through each day. I have no thoughts of self harm or anything like that but there certainly has been thoughts of maybe tonight I just don't wake up.

The last 18 months have really put me through the ringer. I have dealt with anxiety issues and problems sleeping since I was very young, and they still go strong in my late 30s.  I have had them under control for the most part up until the beginning of last year. Unfortunately things started to go sideways and as the events piled up, the anxiety got worse and worse.

I was laid off from a well paying career late 2017 at about the sametime as my partner was as well.  This led to financial strain and eventually relationship strain as well, almost ending the relationship. However, we worked things out and she got a good job again.  I started doing contract work in my field and also picked up a full time job mid year.

Also last spring, we found out we were pregnant. We both have a child from previous relationships. They have become brothers in every way though. The pregnancy while not planned, wasn't totally unwelcome.  Because of some health things, we were told it wasn't possible if we tried. But there we were!  Everything was going smooth until 5 months in, we went for an assessment and there was no heartbeat. The baby had a severe disorder and would have struggled even if it carried. I can say that this really killed any relationship I had with God, I tried going to church a few times after and only ever left with anger.

Then my health turned in the fall. I was found collapsed at home and visited the ER and hospital many times over the next 6 months.  I was unable to work and with my income being primarily from self employment, finances became an issue again as well.  Many, many tests later and almost weekly Dr appointments since and still haven't fully closed in on diagnosis. I have returned to work but am limited in what I can do and energy levels are always low. I am likely heading towards major abdominal surgery this summer.

Three weeks ago my uncle died, a close relative in a very small family. During the week before the service, supporting my mom and also assisting my cousin in the planning, I discovered a calender appointment about an apartment viewing. My girlfriend entered it by accident into our shared calendar. When questioned, she finally said she had decided to leave. 

Over the course of a few days, it was told to me that she had planned to leave for months but was waiting for me to be healthy. She was going to tell me once I went back to work but then my uncle died. So she was going to wait another week but I found out.  The reasons ranged from its been to hard, to many hills to climb, doesn't like being responsible for my son (long story and that one hurt), basically resents me for last year of crap.

Now I have to live were here until end of May until she can move out. Not horrible and we very much like a married couple, it's not that we fight, it's just a very slow burning wound that gets poked everyday.  But with situation as is, she can't leave yet and I need to save some money before she does not that I am working.

The current crisis, I can't even get a car loan. Technically I haven't been in stable work for more than a few weeks as I was on disability and much of my income was self employed.  We shared a car that is in her name.  Not even bad debt lenders said yes, and the regular banks didn't even touch it. I will literally have to spend the money I can save just to get a crappy car with wheels.  Public transit for my work is not an option because I move around so much. This will leave me with almost nothing left when she leaves.

The only plus is that I have a home thst I can keep and my sons knows. But even tougher times are ahead, already my son is talking about hockey in the fall when earlier in the day I was looking at food bank processes.

I am barely functioning at the best of times, and full blown panic at this worst. I wake up shaking at night.  I don't have the energy or focus to deal with everything, work, getting prep for being single, being a full time dad, money.  They are all in total crisis and any energy I devote to one leaves the others falling apart. 

I wish I had the support system around me to lean on but many of my close friends have faded in parenthood etc and others are caught in the middle of our break up.  Everytime I go to my parents, I feel even worse as their version of support is telling what I should have done or I told you so. I have told my mother many times previously how it strains the relationship sometimes, she  disagrees and moves on. Now I don't have the energy to fight the battle.

I can say my one bright spot has been returning to a couple of hobbies I have let fade, board/card gaming and sports.  I have found local groups that I have started to take part in and a few new friends have come from that. Hopefully that blossoms going forward.

This has gotten crazy long.  But it does feel good to put it out there. I am doing my best and trying to focus on the good things and bright spots each day.  Unfortunately, for each day that is good, there is another where I got to bed ok with the thought that maybe I just don't wake up and it all goes away.",09Apr2019,8

Things are **NOT** always what they seem!

&amp;#x200B;

Back in the 1980’s and through the early 1990’s, Route A1A, between Sunrise Boulevard and Las Olas Boulevard, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was packed with naïve and impressionable youth. Fort Lauderdale already had a stellar reputation for being destination ‘Spring Break’.  Each year, hordes of college and high school kids flocked to the city seeking fun times and fond memories.  The same carefree vibe resided in the Summertime.

&amp;#x200B;

Days were spent lounging on the beach and browsing racks of T-shirts bearing witty sayings in various tourist traps. The warm sand was always peppered with people tanning, playing volleyball or tossing a Frisbee. Coolers, empty beer cans, chip bags and cigarette butts were scattered between the towels. The air reeked of salt water mixed with *Coppertone Suntan Oil*.  The only sounds heard were the lapping ocean as it hugged the shoreline and blaring music, (rock, rap or pop), from various battery-operated radios.

&amp;#x200B;

Nightfall, --A1A became a cruising strip, where one hoped to meet the guy or girl of their dreams. Or, at least for one-night, anyway. Horn honks, engine revs and loud music filled the air, as guys competed for the attention of scantily-clad girls. And, if you were an attractive girl, the bouncers at popular clubs like Summers on the Beach, The Candy Store or the famous Elbow Room ignored your obvious underage status and let you in to drink.

&amp;#x200B;

But, behind the good times being had by many youths on Route A1A, were bad times for others. The runaways. Kids who slept on the beach, on benches or at the Covenant House if it had not reached capacity. While others spent the late-night hours whiling away at a Howard Johnson’s Restaurant being cared for by a sixty-something year old, blonde-haired waitress named Jane. She had become a surrogate mother to many of the disadvantaged youth along Route A1A. She often spent her tip money so they could eat.

&amp;#x200B;

Jane helped the runaways on Route A1A. But there was someone else helping them, too. But in a different way. Someone who lurked among the crowds of unsuspecting youth. Someone who was sinister, manipulative and deceptive. Someone on the hunt. Someone who deliberately preyed upon the naïve and impressionable. Someone so average in appearance, he was hidden in plain sight. Someone known as, *The Pancake Pimp*.

&amp;#x200B;

I had recently moved to Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, during the summer, but I was already familiar with Route A1A. I had been traveling to Ft. Lauderdale since I was little for vacations. I managed to make four new friends my first day at the beach. For the purposes of this blog and to protect their identity, I will name them; Max, Jasper, Cassie and Indigo. Our conversation began when Cassie walked over to my beach towel and asked me if I had a light for her cigarette.

&amp;#x200B;

I was introduced to *The Pancake Pimp* several months later at a Denny’s restaurant by Max, Jasper, Cassie and Indigo. The same night, I discovered the truth about my four friends. You see, what they had been projecting about their lives was far from the truth. Like I said in the beginning of the blog, “Things are **not** always what they seem”. I have given the man I met that night at Denny’s, the moniker *The Pancake Pimp* for this story. I refuse to use his real name, nor give him a pseudonym. He was a piece of garbage.

&amp;#x200B;

Max, Jasper, Cassie, Indigo and I joined five other kids already sitting at three tables a waitress had pushed together. Ten minutes later, an overweight, dark-haired, half-balding, bearded man walked through the door. Everyone grew silent and watched as he waddled over to the head of the table like a Grand Poo-bah at a lodge meeting. I wondered who he was. But, I did not dare ask. Because, the moment he entered the restaurant, the atmosphere shifted. The laughter and teen shenanigans halted. No one blew a straw wrapper or flung wadded bits of napkins. The tension he brought in with him was palpable.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Pancake Pimp’s* beady black eyes scanned the table before resting on me. I recall feeling extremely uncomfortable. The man sat three chairs away from me. Far enough out of reach. But still close enough to make my skin crawl. He just stared at me while tugging on his gray and brown beard. I noticed Max, who was sitting beside me, nod his head at *The Pancake Pimp*. I mistakenly thought Max’s sign meant I was deemed *safe* to include in the group gathering. I was wrong. Unbeknownst to me, I had just been okayed to become a member of The Pancake Pimp’s stable of groomed youth.  
 

I watched as each kid sitting at the table, handed over fistfuls of wadded up cash to *The Pancake Pimp’s* greedy, stout sausage fingers. The wheels inside my head were spinning at a rapid rate. Afterwards, he motioned the waitress over and ordered pancakes for everyone. I wanted to leave, but was frozen, like a deer caught in a pair of bright headlights. So, I remained. I sat in silence and ate my pancakes – despite having to force each bite down my throat. Realizing who *The Pancake Pimp* was and what my friends were, made me want to vomit because of what he was doing to them and sob uncontrollably for them. Literally.

&amp;#x200B;

Now you might be asking, *“How could you not know what these kids were? How could you not know you were being groomed?”*  Simple. Perverts like *The Pancake Pimp* do not advertise what they are. These scumbags are like magicians with a clever sleight of hand. You cannot figure out how they do it. They just do. It is not an uncommon practice for them to use youths, like Max, Jasper, Cassie and Indigo, to recruit other youth. Hard to believe it happens. But it does.

&amp;#x200B;

By my observation, *The Pancake Pimp* had created an illusion which each kid sitting at the table clearly believed. He had them convinced they needed him to survive. He was the only one who cared. He was the only one who understood how they felt. He could offer them the world, unlike their parents. He could and would help them have anything and everything they ever wanted - if they listened to him. These innocent kids believed *The Pancake Pimp’s* lies. Every. Single. One. Of. Them. But I did not.

&amp;#x200B;

The truth about *The Pancake Pimp*? He was a bastard who was not helping the disadvantaged youth on Route A1A. No. This man was systematically destroying them: physically, mentally and emotionally to selfishly line his size XXL sized pants pockets with money they had earned by selling their bodies and drugs. He took pleasure in exploiting them to others, using them for sex for himself and plying them with drugs to maintain control. The word ‘disturbing’ does not even begin to describe what this man put these kids through.

&amp;#x200B;

I chose to remain causal friends with Max, Jasper, Cassie and Indigo after learning the truth. Call me naïve if you want, but I always try and see the good, even in the bad. I believed that underneath their groomed deceitful behavior were still good kids, they just had bad luck. Who was I to judge? I went out of my way to avoid *The Pancake Pimp* after that night at Denny’s. He showed up; I left. I remember trying to convince my friends to leave *The Pancake Pimp* – but to no avail. Max, Jasper, Cassie and Indigo were in deeper than my young mind could comprehend at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a summary taken from notes I had penciled in a journal about Max, Jasper, Cassie and Indigo:

&amp;#x200B;

**MAX:**  
 Max was a firecracker. When we first met, I asked him, “So, what’s your name?” He responded, “I got no name.” And then shouted, “I GOT NO NAME!” I thought, “What is up with this crazy guy?” But there was something about him I kind of liked – as a friend.

&amp;#x200B;

On the outside Max projected no fear. He would start fights with good-looking guys on Route A1A out of jealousy. Max was not much to look at. He knew it. He had gnarly teeth, a face covered in acne, greasy, uncombed hair and was not a fan of deodorant. He was loud. Obnoxious. Belligerent. He often danced on the sidewalks on Route A1A, even without music, deliberately hitting people with his flailing arms. The kid literally danced to his own tune. He was an attention seeker. And no matter where he was, he made sure he got noticed.

&amp;#x200B;

To the silent observer, hidden underneath the hard-shell and irritating behavior Max displayed to the world, was a damaged kid. A kid who would be dancing one minute and then hiding behind a dumpster crying the next. Some might classify his behavior as bi-polar or even a possible manic-depressive. Common sense though said Max was lost, lonely, vulnerable and extremely hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

Max could not handle emotional pain. He acted overly-obnoxious on purpose when he felt himself starting to care about someone. It was a protective mechanism. And, he used drugs to medicate his broken heart. He carried pain down inside from being thrown out of his house at the age of thirteen by a father who called him a “pathetic loser” since birth.  After arriving in Florida, Max’s pain only grew worse when he had to turn tricks to support a newly found drug habit. Something he never wanted to do. Something he never wanted to become. But he did. A hustler and an addict. *The Pancake Pimp* got Max hooked on a drug he knew caused consumption to work both ways. Crack. Crack caused Max the need to simultaneously dull emotional pain and drug withdrawal.

&amp;#x200B;

Max had endured the worst form of rejection. Parental. Hence, his need for constant attention hoping to gain validation from others. The rejection Max felt from his dad, made him ripe for the picking. It was no surprise *The Pancake Pimp* ensnared a guy like Max. It is so hard to imagine the reality of dirty-old men picking-up youth like Max from the streets for sex, instead of driving them to a nearby shelter for help.

&amp;#x200B;

Max often spoke of going home one day. To keep him around, *The Pancake Pimp* enticed Max with promises of big money. A lie. He convinced Max that money would earn his father’s respect - something Max desperately longed for. Another lie. *The Pancake Pimp* knew this and used it to his advantage. There was one problem with Max’s dream though. His drug addiction. Every dime he earned, after paying *The Pancake Pimp* his cut, went straight to a dealer for Crack. It was a never-ending vicious cycle Max could not seem to escape.

&amp;#x200B;

The last time I saw Max, he was dancing on the sidewalk with Jasper to music blaring from a car stuck at a nearby red light. Max appeared gaunt, compared to the last time I had seen him. His eyes mirrored a shattered spirit. It hurt my heart to look into his eyes. He became jumpy and paranoid once the light turned green and the music coming from the car faded. His behavior was nothing short of a by-product of his drug addiction and horrendous lifestyle to support it. Soon, a sports car pulled around the corner and a guy whistled him over. Max immediately complied, leaving Jasper and I on the sidewalk. He then got into the car. Before pulling off, he flashed us his infamous gnarly toothed smile. No one saw Max again after that night. No one.

&amp;#x200B;

**JASPER:**  
Jasper was a clean-cut, attractive guy, with hazel eyes and short dark-brown hair. He had just turned eighteen when we met. He always dressed nice and chewed mint gum. He was quite the charmer. A crafty chameleon, who could blend in anywhere. And he did. *The Pancake Pimp* may have had an agenda for Jasper, but rest assured, Jasper had an agenda of his own.

&amp;#x200B;

Jasper was different than the other youth kept snug under *The Pancake Pimp’s* chubby thumb. He had goals and a determination. No one or anything, for that matter, was going to stop him. The others merely talked the talk while Jasper was making things happen in his life. Despite having to do some unsavory things to get where he wanted to be.

&amp;#x200B;

Jasper was keen. He used his good looks to his advantage. Unlike a younger Max, who had to hustle on the streets and take whatever came his way, Jasper zeroed in on wealthy cougars. Women whose husbands and the latest romance novel, featuring Fabio on the cover, failed to satisfy. He was what you would call a ‘gigolo’. He also sold marijuana on the side. Dealing was part of Jasper’s agenda – not *The Pancake Pimp’s*.

&amp;#x200B;

Jasper had run away from a small town out West. He wanted to avoid becoming like his father. A man he described as a toothpick because he drank more than he ate. A man who worked in a sweaty factory. A man who drank himself into a stupor, so deep, he often pissed and puked the bed. Jasper had grown tired of dreaming of a better life for himself, while cleaning up urine and vomit off his drunk father. So, the way he put it, *“I packed up what I could fit inside my duffel bag, stole money out of my old man’s wallet and bought a bus ticket to Florida to go to art school.”* What he neglected to consider was how he was going to afford school while living in Florida. Enter, *The Pancake Pimp*, who introduced Jasper to escorting, after finding him on a bench at the beach.   
 

Jasper attended school and lived in a dorm. He was determined to get an education and be somebody. A professional artist. He longed for a better life than the one he was currently living via *The Pancake Pimp’s* agenda. The same life he observed his friends drowning in with drug and alcohol addiction. To Jasper, a degree meant a guaranteed way out. It meant respect. A professional job would afford him the opportunity to travel to exotic places, meet interesting people, live in a nice apartment and drive a fancy car. If Jasper was not hustling or selling drugs, he was sketching. Always. I may still have one of his sketches tucked away in a memory box somewhere. I do not know if Jasper ever graduated Art School and turned his dreams into a reality. I hope so.

&amp;#x200B;

**CASSIE:**  
 Cassie was a shy, quiet girl with curly blonde hair, blue eyes and a soft-spoken voice. Although she was part of *The Pancake Pimp’s* group of disadvantaged youth, she did not hustle on Route A1A, like the others. And there was a good reason.

&amp;#x200B;

Cassie had run away from home, leaving behind a worried mother and a slime-ball step-father. She shared in horrifying detail how her father had passed away in a car accident. Her mother later married a guy she knew from high school. All seemed great for the newly blended family, until one night, her bedroom door pried open. While her mother slept in the room next door, her step-father climbed into bed with Cassie and well…you get the idea. She said it went on for a couple of years. She tried telling her mom, who refused to believe her. Unfortunately, that is not an uncommon response.  
 

Cassie began drinking and cutting herself to deal with her step-father’s sporadic nighttime visits. Once her mom would pass out after taking sleeping pills with Vodka, soon, the old familiar creak of the bedroom door would be heard. It was followed by the heavy footsteps of her step-father as he made his way over to the bed. Her body would immediately grow rigid as he pulled the covers back and climbed in bed with her.

&amp;#x200B;

Cassie cried and relived what that man did to her, always with slurred speech. Her breakdowns typically happened after a bout of binge drinking. She could not stand the idea of any man touching her, including *The Pancake Pimp*. He never touched her. Never tried. He tended to favor the boys in that department. Cassie found her niche being a low-end dealer for *The Pancake Pimp*. She sold drugs to the youth and tourists partying along Route A1A. And, she also recruited more youth to join the group.  
 

Cassie said she worked as a stripper when she first moved to the area. She never could bring herself to escort like so many of the dancers did for extra cash. She hated sex. She hated men more. She loathed being up on stage taking her clothes off. The leering looks the riled-up men gave to her nude body made her recoil. After each shift, she systematically got blackout drunk to erase the touch of their dirty hands on her body - including the memory of her retched step-father. She eventually quit stripping when she met *The Pancake Pimp*, who wandered into the strip club bearing big cash, big promises and big lies.

&amp;#x200B;

One day, Cassie up and quit everything. No more selling drugs. No more binge drinking. She wanted to clean up her life. I think watching Jasper’s life improve, may have inspired her to make such a bold move. While staying at the Covenant House, Cassie made the fatal mistake of calling her mother. She was hoping her mother would finally believe what she had said to her about her step-father molesting her. Cassie was devastated when her mother refused to believe it. Her mom even accused Cassie of *‘doing something to ask for it’.*  Cassie nearly drank herself to death after that phone call. It was a sad time. And the sadness peaked when Cassie learned her mother was coming to Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, to take her home.  She refused to go back and be violated again. So, she ran away. Where she went remains a secret to this day.

&amp;#x200B;

**INDIGO:**  
 Indigo was a genuine mystery encased in a riddle. He was the youngest of the group. Sixteen. How or why he wound up on the streets I wish I knew. He never said. I never thought to ask. Indigo had a stocky build and spiky jet-black hair. Every item of clothing he wore was black. He spoke few words with his mouth but said many with his eyes if you were paying attention. He worked the streets to fuel a drug habit. Heroin.  Indigo was book smart, but covered in track marks. He could quote historical facts one minute and be incoherent and puking on himself the next. He was the only person I ever met who liked algebra. Unfortunately, Indigo overdosed. I heard it happened long after we lost touch. To be honest, I was surprised it had not happened sooner. If not for heroin, I cannot help but wonder what or who Indigo might have become.  

&amp;#x200B;

**THE PANCAKE PIMP:**  
 I do not know what became of *The Pancake Pimp*.  I do not care to know either. He is irrelevant in life, and only relevant to tell the story of Max, Jasper, Cassie and Indigo. Hopefully he is in jail or rotting in a fiery pit in Hell where he belongs.

&amp;#x200B;

Becoming a victim of a predator happens easier than most people realize. I wish I could have done more to help the others. But I was young, like them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Predators sense weakness and use it to their own twisted advantage. They are everywhere. *The Pancake Pimp* comes in all shapes, sizes, careers and genders. The moment someone offers you *‘the world’* without strings, *“Because I care about you”*, know there is a heavy price coming that you will be expected to pay. *The Pancake Pimp* sells a great fantasy to any eager ear willing to give a listen. Money. New clothes. Nice apartment. Sports car.  Drugs. You name it. Anything you could possibly want. The words coming out of their mouths are nothing but deception.

&amp;#x200B;

Study your surroundings and trust your gut instinct. Always. If something feels off, even a smidge, trust your gut. And never, ever, no matter how bad it gets, allow someone to convince you to compromise your values or violate your body. No one has the right to take advantage of you. There are so many places available to help whether you need food, clothing, shelter or someone to talk to. You do not need *The Pancake Pimp* or his or her lies.

&amp;#x200B;

If you were groomed by a predator and did things you wish you could take back, forgive yourself, first. Please. You did nothing wrong. You were/are an innocent victim of a predators wrong-doing. Do not feel shame. Do not feel stupid. You were tricked. Lied too. Used. Predators are good at what they do. They are masters of making a delusion appear to be a titillating illusion one finds hard to resist.

&amp;#x200B;

To fully heal, you need to find a way to forgive them. Forgiving someone who did something so despicable will probably make you want to throw-up. But forgiveness is the only way you will be able to heal from the pain they caused to you. It is the only way you will be set free.  The forgiveness is not for their benefit. It is for yours. They never need to know you forgave them. But you need to forgive so you can heal.

&amp;#x200B;

A better life can and will happen for you. Starting – right now.

He was my first boyfriend ever. Nothing major happened, he didn't cheat on me or said mean stuff, ever, but it was still an ""unsatisfactory"" experience for me and I feel like I lost my faith in being in a relationship with someone. I mean I had so nuch love and affection for him and I wanted to show it at every chance I got, but it wasn't reciprocated. He wouldn't text me for days at a time, he would go to sleep early instead of staying up a little longer to spend time with me, didn't really try to keep the conversation going when we went out. Things like that. I wasn't THAT hurt. I was 23 when I met him. So even though I never had LTR before, my expectations weren't too unrealistic. But I felt unloved and not cared about. 

I dont know what I want anymore. I dont wanna invest to much time and energy and emotions into a person again and end up disappointed. Yet I wish someone loved and cared about me. I wish someone loved and cared about me to restore my faith in love. But I'll be okay if no one does. It's not the end of world nor my biggest problem.",09Apr2019,2

They were so bad that during one visit to the ER the social worker who saw them told me that she had never seen self harm scars that bad before. Initially, I was always really ashamed of them and afraid of what people would think when they saw them. Especially people I knew. So I always religiously hid them, even in the summer I would wear the classic long sleeve sweater, it was unbelievably hot and uncomfortable, like a kind of horrible punishment or something.

Over time I started to feel more comfortable and wear short sleeves\\tank tops. My worst fears have happened and people have asked me about them. I used to lie and make up these unbelievable stories that I had a new cat or dropped a piece of glass and got hurt. No one believed them but no one made me feel bad about them either. In fact people showed genuine concern and wanted to make sure that I was ok.

Today I realized that I don't think about my scars anymore. Doesn't matter what I'm wearing it doesn't even occur to me to cover up or try to hide them. I'm sure people see them and think things, but whether they are good or bad I could honestly care less.

20,"Sorry long post, just super excited and want to explain why haha.

TD;LR at bottom

I come from a lower class family, split parents, dad doing everything he can to keep a roof over our heads. Mom mooching off my grandfather and never working. To say the least brand new appliances were never on anyone mind.

I am now a 21yr old married mom of two (essentially I was a VERY troubled teen, but when I fell pregnant at 16 flipped my shit around to try to be the best mom I could) with both my husband and I are going to college and working part time. We have been using a decently old top load washer that makes way to much noise and shakes out whole house when in use, making it impossible to run during nap times, and a dryer that you can only put about 5-10 pieces of clothing in at a time to avoid a deafening screech while it's running. So between our schedules and childrens nap/bedtimes we have been falling so far behind on laundry. At one point we fell so far behind we decided to go to the laundromat just to get it all done at once and had to spend 50$ in quarters.

So getting to the point my husband and I were finally able to go into home depot today and buy ourselves a brand new washer and dryer. This will be the first actual brand new appliance I have ever had in my life  and I am so excited i spent most of the night just looking at the features and specs on them. They are rated as one of the top sets in all areas but most importantly rated very high in noise level. Every one of the reviews talks about how quiet they are! Dont get me wrong they are by no means the most amazing and expensive set out there but damned if I'm not like a little kid on Christmas! 

Sorry for the long post I just have so much excitement for this and I think I'm overwhelming my husband with all of my talk about them so I had to get this out somewhere Haha.

I started an intensive outpatient program for my BED two months ago but my attendance has been spotty because of my isolating. I had a bad weekend and I missed today again. This of course sends me down a shame spiral that just makes me feel worse.

I know that going to therapy will help, but how do I go if I can’t get myself out of the house? I’ve tried all sorts of cbt/dbt methods to at least take that first step but most days I just give up before I even try.

I  used to work full-time hours casual and it was great. I had the money,  security and everything that comes with keeping busy and being happy.  Since January I was let go after they dropped my hours to 2 half-day  shifts a week and I couldn't afford driving to work each day with the  rate they dropped it to as well. I thought they couldn't do this but  digging deeper and asking around I found it being pretty common for a  lot of people who worked there or in similar work (warehouse hands).

Since  then I decided to retake studying as my primary waste of time.  Initially I thought to go back to my unfinished degree but in a  spur-of-the-moment decision I jumped into commerce and thought I'd be  set until I finished the degree. Money dried up pretty quick after  starting, having spent most of my savings on important things like a  second-hand car to get to and from, petrol for said car and supplies for  my degree (laptop, books, etc). When I realised money would be an issue  I went out and started looking for a few hours a week closer to home  but after being turned away by almost all of my 40-50 applications, it  turned into a bit more of a dire situation. I tried everything from  revising my resume, looking through agencies and looking for odd jobs  here and there to boost it and make myself some small cash.

It  would stop there if I found a job, I'd be back on my feet and I'd be on  my way to doing bigger things but here we are. Since having my wallet  stolen, every job response seems to ask for my ID, and if my replacement  doesn't ship soon I'm going to miss a golden opportunity with an agency  who is already sticking their neck out for me to wait this long before  Easter to get me a spot. I've received NO compensation from my  Centrelink claim being rejected (Aussie btw) and NO reason for  rejection, despite being a jobless student in a dire situation. To top  things off my mother was just discharged from hospital and requires  full-time care being in a wheelchair. If work doesn't give me more than 3  shifts a week (all I can work is 4 with my schedule at uni until i drop  a course next trimester) I'm going to be unable to support my mum or  myself.

Sorry  if it's long-winded or messy, I just needed a place to vent and get  this out for maybe some advice or ideas what to do. Got nothing from the  government for me or my mum in compensation and I'm running out of  options if this doesn't line up perfectly this week.",09Apr2019,2

My point is, out of the entire possibility of things I could imagine doing and places I might like to go, my biology limits me. If not directly and I try to use technology to go to these places or realise these things, it’s more than likely that another fact of my biology limits me - I am mortal and will die soon.

By the same reasoning, my biology also dictates that there are some things I do better or worse than others. I have strengths and weaknesses.

When I say I want to be the best sprinter in the world, I must say “I can’t do that, my biology limits me”. I don’t have right balance of slow to fast twitch muscle fibres or a frame optimised for sprinting.

Before people ask ""why do you have a problem with subforwhitepeopleonly and not BPT"", there are a few reasons, but the major thing is that it isn't just acting as a space for white people to hang out and talk.

I've skimmed through top posts on the sub and if you do the same you'll find comments and posts telling black people to pick cotton, saying that the lives of mixed people are worth less than white people, and very flagrant use of racial slurs.

I really don't see why a subreddit like this is allowed to be active on the site.

Not entirely related, but I find it funny/absurd that reddit slapped a ""Lets Fight Racism"" link on the side of the sub.",09Apr2019,0
44,"**Procrastination kills more dreams than failure ever will!**

Based on my research for overcoming procrastination, I have found the most powerful technique there is - at least for me, anyway. Want to know what that is? It's doing more of what scares me. It's doing more of what makes me feel vulnerable. Simply put, it's taking action, taking action in the face of adversity.

This is what I have found works best for me. Here is some good content on overcoming procrastination.

45,"I just want to preface this saying that I know I'm responsible for this but I don't think it's entirely my fault 

Anyways, I'm pretty young. Still in high school. There was a girl I dated last year and now she's dating someone in my friend group (let's call him Arthur) , although I don't really talk to him he's friends with my other friends. Me and the girl got into a lot of fights but we also, well sexted quite a bit. After a lot of fighting we realized it wasn't going to work. She got in moods where she liked to aggravate me and I have anger problems. After a lot of not very important drama, we ended up dating and breaking up like three or four times in total. But even then, we remained friends and talked a lot. We also still sexted every now and then, telling ourselves it was just because it was something we needed and nothing serious. Word got out that Arthur liked him and she confided in me that she only liked him when he said he liked her, but that's not really important. There relationship was doing well, Arthur and her got to the hand holding stage and they kissed once (they're both really awkward people). One night though, me and her were talking and this is where I fuck up. We both hint at a bunch of things,( I broke up with my other girlfriend a few months ago and have been pretty lonely) and I felt she was the only one I could trust so I asked if she had any ideas for a sex scene for a story I'm working on. She understandably took it the wrong way but then we got onto the topic of sexting. I made sure I wasn't forcing her but it was clear she wanted it. I didn't even begin to fathom the repercussions and one thing led to another. We did it in a way that we pretended to be two characters in the story (stupid i know) and well, we just did it. I wasn't even thinking of her in all honesty, I just couldn't control myself. We both regretted it afterwards and promised eachother that we wouldn't tell anybody anything in the PM and we both exchanged a few secrets as the night winded down. Well, she told Arthur. She didn't tell me she did until it was too late. He glared at me the whole time during lunch and me being the idiot I am thought he was just doing what he was normally doing at lunch. When we left, he pulled me back and pushed me, without saying a word. Nobody else understood what happened but suddenly I did. She broke our promise and told him, not even warning me about it. I don't know this kid too well, but honestly I'm kind of scared he's going to do something worse but I want to get as little people as possible involved. I blocked her, this now being another time I stupidly believed I could trust her but before letting her know that I had a screenshot of one of her secrets because deep down I felt she might betray me. (the secret is a big one, it's textual proof that Arthur fingered her during class) and definitely something they don't want out. But now I don't know what to do. I'm scared Arthur will tell all of my friends what happened, even though he doesn't have technical proof. If they find out I'll probably be disowned by all of them and I personally believe that although I'm at fault, it wouldn't of happened if she kept her promise or didn't bring up sexting or didn't have underlying relationship problems with Arthur to begin with. I don't know what to do. Do I try to talk to him? I feel it's fair I tell what she said to me but that may lead to more problems as it's essentially blackmail but feels like my only choice. I really don't want to get anyone involved but please help.",09Apr2019,1

Going one step further, I checked the BMI ranges by category. If I want to be considered ""healthy,"" that is, the heaviest I can be without being considered overweight, I'd need to lose over 25% of my weight, dropping from 230 to 170 lbs. I was in MUCH better shape in high school than I am now, enough to compete fairly well in any sport, and I was in the 190's then. And that's just the minimum I'd need to lose to be ""healthy,"" hitting the median means losing over a THIRD of my weight to hit 150, or dropping 80lbs for those who don't like fractions. Furthermore, apparently my weight won't be medically concerning until I drop down to almost half, 125lbs. It would take a tragic sawmill accident for me to be considered underweight.

Who the hell even follows this system anymore? It's an incredibly easy way to ruin my day when I previously thought I was fine. I understand that I need to drop quite a few pounds (goal weight is 200 by 2020) but apparently I have to go back to my weight at 14 (and I was a beanpole) to not have health risks",09Apr2019,0
50,"So, I am at work right now, super frustrated and this is the first subreddit that came to my mind to talk about my experience.

So, I am doing an internship in an international environment. I started the previous month, so evetything is new: new country, new house, new roommates, new friends, new life in general.

The first month was rather difficult for me, as I am rather introverted and I needed sometime until I felt comfortable with the people around me. So, one month forward, I've met with most people in my group and we have come closer with 5-6 of them, doing small trips etc.

Some days ago, a new guy comes to the office. Argentinian with Italian roots, I admit that I found him very cute. While we were talking the first day, he mentioned something about his girlfriend, so that was a disappointment. 

Important note about my sexual life, it's non-existent. I am in my 20s, obese, my self-esteem regarding my looks is as low as possible. Let's say humor is how I tend to socialize. I've never had a date, a relationship, a kiss, a flirt anything... I even have doubts about my sexuality.

Back to today, I, this Argentian guy and a Spanish girl I've come a little closer to, have to move together with the bus. In no time they start speaking in Spanish, which I do not speak, and generally having a very flirty atmosphere between them, touching each other on random moments etc. I should mention that according to that girls Instagram, she also has a boyfriend-she has never mentioned him though.

So while at the bus, seeing this situation I got sooo frustrated. So many thoughts passed by my mind. How can they exclude me like that? How can they do that while they both supposedly have partners? While I ever experience something like that? What does this guy think about me? Probably I would never stand a chance with him.

Am I overreacting with that situation? I know that I should focus on my mental and physical health to become more self confident, I've even made attempts to work on these things. But at the end of the day lying on the bed, eating a bag of cheaps and drinking a bottle of soda seems the easiest solution.

I feel like I know what I have to do, I know that even seeing a therapist would be a nice option, but I have absolutely no motivation to improve my self.",09Apr2019,1
51,"I'm not happy with the way my life has been going the last 2-3 years. I feel stuck in a job I don't really want and everything else is going so-so. Mostly just feels stagnant. 

I had to cut ties with my crazy mom recently because she wouldn't stop insulting and trying to control me, and I'm so frustrated she just won't act like a normal human. Got a bit fat again because I wouldn't stop stress-eating and -drinking, so now I have to lose like 25 lbs. All my applications to interesting looking jobs so far haven't really gone anywhere and now I'm approaching what I feared, that I either have to consider moving or just accept that I won't get a cool job in the near future.

All of this is especially frustrating because I was so happy for a few years until various things turned to shit and my efforts to change my life for the better all work either very slowly or just not at all.

I feel annoyed and frustrated every single day. Think a lot about happier times in the past and how just 3 years ago life seemed so effortless and fun, now I just feel stuck and like a loser. And I know full well that I'm overreacting and things are nowhere as bad as I perceive them but that doesn't stop the feeling. I feel a bit better when I'm at home in the evenings and can distract myself, or on the occasion when I'm doing something fun (though even then sometimes the frustration is stronger).

52,"I’ve lived in a different city about two hours away from my parents since I first moved out on my own in September 2017. I love it here. I love how everything is in a 10 minute radius, I love that I live 15 minutes from the beach, and the area itself is just simply a lot prettier than where my parents live (and where I spent all of my life before I moved out). But it’s also a lot more expensive to live there. I like my job there and I love my kids (I’m a daycare worker) but it doesn’t pay enough. Also doesn’t help that I get sick with something I have to call out for at least every other month.

I’m going back to school so I can get a better job that pays more and that I (hopefully) enjoy more. There’s a program in the city I’m in now, but again, I can’t afford it. I’m already $15000 in debt from a previous (useless) degree and I don’t want to add an even more ridiculous number on top of that just so I can stay where I want to. 

Financially I know that moving back in with my parents would be the better option (there’s another program around there). I would still have to pay for insurance, phone bill, groceries, etc. just not rent or utilities. Which saves a lot of money. I can also get a much better paying job with the county since multiple family members retired from or currently work there. But the thing is, I don’t WANT to. I got out as soon as I could because I like to be independent. I love my parents and my family to death but I don’t want to live with them. I moved out to this city so I could get my life started and I feel like I failed. My twin brother also still lives with our parents and I’ve always felt like I’ve lived in his shadow. Right now he has a full time job helping develop a vaccine for meningitis while also getting a master’s degree (fully paid for by his work). And I don’t want to be around that again. I always compare.

I feel like I’m rambling now. I know there’s nothing shameful about moving back in with your parents especially in this day and age. I’m not ashamed, I just want more out of my life I guess.",09Apr2019,2

It's the worst combo of two attachment styles. I don't get my needs met but at the same time I want him to still love me because of my fear of rejection.

I want to share this as a cautionary message about how decieving people can be and what they may be hiding under the mask they put on. Also sharing this will also help me, I hope...



So, since I'm a nerd/geek let's start this off Star Wars style: A long time ago in a Californian town in the US of A...


Throughout my life being a person with Asperger's syndrome(a condition on the autistic spectrum) I can act awkward, say awkward things I display intense interest in unconventional things compared to others(martial arts and animated stuff). I may do socially inappropriate things when to me at the moment they seem like not a big deal( People with AS don't pick up well on social cues) Throughout the years I have never made lifelong friends ever really. One is because I have moved several times( about 5 over my life) but also because I could never be real friends with other kids and I did become best friends with someone for awhile but after some awkward inappropriate things I am not proud of that kinda went out the window. I just was not good socially. That combined with my parents horrible relationship and eventual divorce, and some abuse from my old man himself and you'll see why my desire for closeness and acceptance led me to not noticing the red flags






This is where my ''friend'' Simba comes into play. Simba was born in some African country and suffered from abuse during his early childhood but now he lives in the US with his father and stepmother,  brothers and sister. Their family was your typical conservative Christian one, voted Republican, regiments and schedules the children followed, and of course fundamentalist beliefs such as creationism, etc. But they weren't the fully crazy Christians either. I hung out with Simba as well as hanging with his younger brothers, almost kinda seeing them as family as ours got to know each other. Aside from doing LEGOs with the younger brothers, me and Simba would play basketball, talk Marvel, DC and Star Wars since he was also a fan and overtime, girls came into the picture. I was 13, he was 14 so yeah not out of the ordinary. However this is where things begin to go south...


As we continued to talk about girls, hints of who Simba really was began to show. For one thing, he made comments about my sister, who was 10-11 at the time has always been rather ahead of alot of her peers in terms of her physical development. He said she would be hot when she is older and guys would be after her, and I went along with it because from my perspective this was just  typical teenage boy stuff where if you have a sister you remark on her looks. Do keep this in mind as this is important later. 


Aside from that, Simba also would come over to my house when my mother wasn't home, again I thought this was just the normal aspects of being a teen boy I had been missing out on. But he showed his darker side because of his demanding attitude. For example, my mom had some diet cupcakes that me and my sister weren't allowed into, but he still demanded I give him some even though I ended up taking the fall for him. Another time he tried to cook eggs but burned the skillet and I took the fall again. Then one day we were searching for a movie On Demand and he wanted to watch one that had to be rented. When  I kept telling him no because our mom doesn't like extra charges on the cable bill, he then got an angry expression on his face and said that I was just trying to control everything and if I was like that girls would just dump me in an instant, which convinced me to rent the movie. In fact, it was rather common for him to threaten to expose my social failures in order for me to get him and his brothers snacks, , even though they were rather well fed at home and it ate up time and my biweekly allowance. He also liked to play up his good looks and athletic physique compared to my skinny but average one.



 Simba actually had me give him him my cell phone so that not only could he texts his friends and the girls he liked but also to text the ones I did we didn't go to the same schools, but somehow he claimed to have known/hung out with the 3 girls I crushed on mainly during my earlier adolescence. The main one would be this girl from my old church who Simba had saw when I invited him to youth group and church trips. I told this girl I liked her twice, but each time she said she didn't feel the same but Simba claimed he had her number and texted her with her saying she wasn't brave enough and that she was playing hard to get. This is where things may seem a bit hard to follow so I will explain:


Eventually in late 2014 me and my family moved to a different town 50+ miles away.  I was still in touch with Simba at the time and one day he demanded I had to get my phone to him(my old town is 50+miles away because the church girl was going through shit that was making her very suicidal, and me talking to her was the only thing that made her feel better(even though she rejected my feelings twice, he claimed she secretly like me). He claimed that I would mess things up, so he was gonna pretend to be me talking to her. I told him I couldn't get there(no money and how would my mom not notice me gone?) and then he pushed saying if I really loved her I would get there. When I couldn't, he said I was ''letting her die, good job'' and when I tried to explain it was out of my hands he texted ''go away you asshole''. But funny thing is, he had recently reprimanded me about how me being so worried about her allegedly bad circumstances was me being unnaturally clingy but now was saying I had to drop everything and somehow travel what was essentially an 100+mile round trip. This put serious doubts in my mind going forward and as you'll see for good reason.



Some time later when my family was visiting my old church we stopped by his house in our old neighborhood. I really felt like I should be talking to this girl if she really did like me, but he kept insisting that I would just mess things up and that's why I needed to give him my phone and he had to pretend to be me. He then said she tried to kill herself over 3 times and one of them was extremely recent because I was ignoring her. The thing is, before I moved I asked if she wanted to keep in touch and she said no as she doesn't really text people.  And again, she was at church fine with signs of any scarring or whatever of her supposed attempts on her own life(he claimed she hung herself really tight around the neck and then tried the bathtub suicide by cutting her wrist and bleeding in the water). He said she was in the ICU at some point but this is just ludicrous. If someone is that suicidal, they'd be in some kind of mental health care and a serious investigation. I know because my sister went through something similar last year. But he claimed that doing this was the only way to save her. Now before we had gotten caught about me giving him his phone because my morning alarm had went off and woke up his parents. Well seems history repeats itself because it apparently happened again when his parents called my mom, and apparently somehow my phone got broken in the process. After that I didn't visit him again or hear from him for quite some time. But over time, I became glad because really the doubts had been building up, and seeing the all the contradictions in the claims he made, how he treated me and so on all but convinced me I was being used. Over the course of the following years of me being in high school he tried to reach out to me about 2-3 times but I had basically said I felt it best if things ended to one effect or the other. But after this past summer, I'm afraid the story doesn't end there...


As mentioned before, I grew up witnessing massive dysfunction between my parents and that influenced me and my sister's dynamic as we had our fair share of arguments even though we ultimately love each other. But during this past summer, we were having another argument and to avoid conflict I shut my bedroom door and then my sister put holes in the door by hitting it with out toilet paper holder. When my mom got home and began reprimanding her about it as well as her other outbursts(2 of which were her being suicidal) she then started to break down crying even more, like really bawling her eyes out and shaking and then said that during one of the times I had Simba over, I guess I was preoccupied with something and he shoved her up against the wall and molested her.



I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I mean, quite a long time ago she had actually joked that Simba had done something to her I didn't want to know about, but she had said it so sarcastically I didn't think she meant it. But now here she was, crying so hard she was slapping away my mother's attempts to console her. My father was pissed, and was initially upset at me for having him in the house but it didn't stick long. My dad wanted to file a police report but my mother ended up contacting a crisis lace and now a few months later nothing has come of it. Me, I actually broke down crying because of everything I felt at that time. Betrayal because I had actually thought of him as the brother I never had once, Sadness at how the little sembleance of a normal teenage experience was all fake, guilt over letting him be near my sister and not noticing all the signs and horror at the fact that he was a much darker person than I expected.



The other day, I was looking through one of my secondary email accounts and saw that months ago in February Simba had tried to add me on Linkedlin. That's when I decided to send an email, calling him out for all his schemes, lies, bullshit and especially what he did to my sister. I told him he was sick and I was stupid to ever listen to him and I never wanted to speak or hear from him again. Later on, he then texted me saying that he was never alone with or touched my sister and that he would get his pastor involved and call the police for me making up lies. He also threatened to expose me for the stuff with girls and the fetish videos I had looked at at that age because it was ''sickening that I though of yourself as a saint'' as he put it. I then said I wasn't gonna tell anyone because it wouldn't do any good. I mean as sad as it is, this happened years ago and any physical evidence would be long gone. 


After I had said that he then said God wants us all to forgive(he doesn't know I was a Buddhist now)  and that I was bringing up stuff from the past and that he forgave himself and me and that he has nothing but love for me as a brother. He then said that he would call me later for a man to man talk and then said if not that was fine but that he wishes me well and hopes God stirs something in me. I said there was no need for that and said goodbye.


Honestly, that conversation was rather scary looking back. Because having shared this with someone who had an abusive upbringing and doing some digging into the mentality of abusers, this just further confirmed my fears. I mean, the gist of what I said in the email was calling him out on everything and telling him never to contact me again, but I didn't say I was telling anyone or even told him that my parents knew. And yet straight from the get go he threatened and blackmailed me, said I couldn't accuse him because of my own flaws and then starts talking about forgiveness even though he claims he never lied about anything or did anything to my sister. And there's the fact he claimed to still see me as a brother and wishes me the best but yet he had just threatened to call the police and blackmailed me for simply bringing this up. And then there was pulling all this shit about being some kind of God-fearing Christian man and really going for an appeal to emotion with the ''God wants forgiveness'' and stuff and how he hopes something is ''stirred in me.'' Please. And the sad thing is there are alot of people like him out there. Who decieve and hurt others while wearing a holy mask. It's disgusting



 At this point, it's best t just let this go. Luckily he doesn't know specifically where I live, only the general area I reside in. I'm currently a community college student majoring in biology and working at Dominos and I do have some friends now, so I do have hope for the future. But I am praying that this story serves as a lesson in that people can really decieve you, and you have to be very wary or them doing so, as it will hurt not just you, but those closest to you as well.



So, to my ex-friend ''Simba'', I seriously hope that if you are still up to your games, you eventually get caught and get what you deserve and that you aren't ale to do to any girl what you've done to my sister nor will anyone else be decieved by you like I was. You are certainly no kind of good Christian, or any kind for that matter. You're just as bad as one of these pervert priests. You are a truly sick and conning bastard, so let's NEVER, EVER, meet again...",09Apr2019,1

63,"I'm becoming more and more introverted as I get older and have come to realize that a few things are driving this.

I haven't made a new friend in well over a decade.  Why?  Well it seems that for every 1,000 people you meet you are lucky if a single one turns out to be a good person - someone that is kind, honest, and trustworthy.  

I can think back in my life to a time when I trusted almost everyone.  I was raised in a small farm town and just took that mentality with me out into the world.  As the years have worn on I've found that the moral compass and ethics that I was raised with don't seem to be very prevalent in American society anymore.  The current political climate in our country has really put that on display.

Also there seems to be a direct negative correlation between how financially secure you are versus how many ""honest"" people you meet.  My wife and I live a very private, non-flashy life.  We dress for the farm, drive an old pickup, and eating out for us is going to the Waffle House (we cook awesome meals for ourselves at home).

Whenever we have ""opened the door"" to help or befriend other people things start out well until the other party realizes we might have some money.  Then the problems start.

The more this has happened over the years the more we have just closed down and put up barriers.  Don't get me wrong, we still like to help people but we have just found that it is easier to do anonymously than helping someone that is actually present in your life. 

I wish it wasn't this way.  I really wish we could meet some honest, caring people that aren't always trying to stick their hands in your pockets.

We have a really fun property and over the past 7 years have tried to find a person or couple that could help us maintain the place.  Regardless of paying great salary and providing room and board, each time we have been left disappointed by the people that we have hired.  Each and every one has tried to take advantage of us.  

I have one rule - never lie.  If I found out you lied about one thing then how can I ever accept anything else you say without questioning if it is true or not.  The foundation of all relationships has to be trust.  This seems to be foreign to most people.

At this point it seems that my wife and I have had to come to the hard conclusion that there are so few good, honest people in the world that we just will never meet people that we can count on to share our lives with us.

I would note we still have our ""original friends"".  Friends from high school, college, and from old work colleagues but those are all long-distance friendships.  And we have our children but similarly they are off and running in their lives.

65,"To clear any confusion out right away, She's great, I'm just unsure of how to proceed and stressing myself out over things that are likely nothing.

I'm 22m shes 25f.

We've been seeing each other for a month now. Mostly casual cuddling, sharing meals, various activities. Not exclusive, no kissing/sex, which I don't mind because we've talked about it. She recently got out of an abusive relationship, and we've had really good communication regarding her needing space and time. I'm totally on board with it, and am in no rush. But even though my brain is aware of this, I still have a lot of strong feelings I'm relatively unsure of how to deal with.

I'm gonna make a list because its easier than trying to write a cohesive story.

* I have a difficult time coming up with conversation topics. This isn't exclusive to her, I struggle to talk to most people I haven't been friends with for years. I'm usually comfortable with this, if I don't have anything to say I don't say anything. However I can't help but feel like I should be talking more. I want to, but nothing comes to mind. 

* She has initiated the hangouts and cuddles a lot which is great. But it always feels like I'm being given permission to do so. There's little reciprocation, which is huge for me. Since I don't really like to speak a lot the I feel like I'm desired more when I'm being touched and physically sought out, and that's missing. But it seems like its because she's still trying to recover from her abuse in the prior relationship. I don't know at this point. 

* There are a LOT of other guys who want her attention. She constantly has messages from them, although she is great at ignoring them while doing things. I get it, online dating does that and she's a very high quality person, I'm not gonna be the only one. But it still sucks to be reduced to an option, even if I'm the option she spends the most time with. 

* I am finding myself thinking about her pretty much all day. Wondering why she's taking so long to respond, did I do anything wrong, can I keep her interested in me. I can't help but think these things, and I have so little to do at my job that I have all the free time in the world to brood. It's hard to get my mind off of it. I want to go back to how I was before she showed up, only thinking about girls when I got REAL lonely. I hate feeling stressed out like this. 

I DON'T want to make it seem like she's a bad person or anything. Everything here is more and issue of me not really being able to handle this correctly. I enjoy all the time I spend with her, face to face almost none of this is ever really thought of. But when I'm not all these insecurities I never realized I had come flying into my face. She's incredibly communicative, smart, is setting herself up for success, enjoys her hobbies and lifestyle. We interact well and her character is great.

I think I'm so stressed out and worried about this because it's the first time in 5 years I've had this kind of relationship with a gal. The last one was at the end of high school. Don't get me wrong I've had opportunities, but was never really interested enough in the person to bring it to this level. I'd hate to miss out on a good opportunity because I'm being dumb. 

I'm also keeping in mind that it's only been a month. And my experience in this field is limited. AND that shes recovering from an abusive relationship. I'm keeping the ball in her court and listening. 

My options seem to be:

* Remove myself from the situation completely. I think this would cause me to miss out on some great times with a great person, and it would suck a LOT for a while. 

* Keep on feeling this way and hope things progress. I think this could potentially lead to her going another direction and me being crushed and feeling like I wasted all my time, or it could develop into something amazing with an amazing person. 

* Back off physically but keep up communication. This could also lead to me being very disappointed that nothing happened, and seeing/talking to her could lead to me being sad about what ""could have been,"" or it could give her space to recover and something could lead from it once she feels like shes healed. 

As for my own situation in life, I'm incredibly comfortable and happy. I've got a great job for someone my age, I enjoy the people I spend time with, I'm slowly starting to improve my lifestyle to be healthier, I'm about to start expanding my hobbies. I've got some financial things to fix, but other than that I'm doing great. The only thing that seemed to be missing was an s/o, which until she showed up I wasn't really worried about. 

I don't know what to do. I don't really expect any advice or anything, although I wont complain to hear anyones thoughts. It feels really weird to write this down like this, but has helped to try and talk about it. 

TL;DR I'm facing insecurities I didn't know I had because of the interactions with a girl I've been seeing. AFAIK my mind is being rational about it but the feelings are there regardless. I'm unsure of how to continue and wish I could stop thinking so much.",09Apr2019,1
66,"Growing up, I did mean spirited things as a child to others. I was a compulsive liar for attention.  I did these things through high school and some of college. Many of the reasons I did these things was because of my home life. But I feel that is no excuse to act that way. It wasn't until about 20 that I realized I needed to change, and I did. 

Now I'm 27 and am struggling to forgive myself. I feel I need to make amends to anyone I hurt or who felt I did something shady. It's impacting my current friendships. I walk on egg shells in fear I might say something the wrong way, or they perceive something the wrong way, and I'll lose their friendship. 

Has anyone else gone through this? What helped?",09Apr2019,1
67,"I was thinking about photo / video restoration, the information contained within old grainy photos and footage, and just what it is a human does when restoring footage.

Scenario - let’s says I have an old degraded photo of a car. I want it restored, so I send it to an expert.

They use their knowledge of the broad elements to fill in the missing or incomplete elements. They’re able to see through the noise of degradation and eliminate things that don’t fit, like dust, scratches and what not.

They might even be able to increase the resolution by enlarging the photo and cleaning up the boundaries between elements in the photo.

But there is a limit to this - the information they have to work with exists in two dimensions. They do all they can with it in the time they have, and when they’re done they send it to me. I’m happy, it’s not perfect but it’s much better than the original.

What about video footage? This is a series of stills. There are 3 dimensions to the video footage - up, down, and time. The images progress. If you were restoring one frame only, you will reach a point of uncertainty with any restorative decision where you have to stop because you’re just guessing.

But with video, you can reference the next frame, and the next frame. Where there was uncertainty before, with each frame you’re drastically improving on that uncertainty.

You’re also able to infer very detailed geometry with video as objects move through 3D space.

A sufficiently advanced A.I will be able to not only apply advanced restorative techniques to each element of the frame based on a level of memory information unimaginable to the human restorer, but it will also be able to eliminate errors and improve accuracy by referencing the temporal aspect of the footage.

Furthermore, if such a system were to be combined and have access to 3D modelling and rendering, it will be able to generate a 3D model of the scene and fill in the detail with an accuracy that is limited only by its computing power.

All of this leads me to believe that at some point in the not so distant future, we will be able to use A.I restoration to restore the most degraded of stock video footage to a level of detail that surpasses any of the best CGI we have today.

Not only that - regarding automatically recreating and rendering the scene in 3D - we will be able to experience this footage with full immersion.

If none of this makes sense then just think about it this way. The human mind is a neural net. If you took the best 3D visual artist and gave them millions of years to do nothing but recreate some grainy old WW1 footage using the latest graphics technology in 3D for virtual reality, giving them access to all historical knowledge we possess about all of the elements depicted within the scene, just think about what their tiny little human neural net would be able to produce.

This is more or less exactly what an A.I would be able to accomplish in a fraction of the time, accomplishing levels of detail unimaginable to us. 

Just think about that for a moment. This realisation is literally blowing my mind.",09Apr2019,1
69,"I feel so terrible for even thinking that he is unattractive.

I met him 8 months ago, with a beard he is handsome. Honestly women literally stare at him, he gets hit on by women and gay men like almost everyday, when i introduced him to my friends they were in awe, couldn'ttake their eyes off him. He could totally be a model, he's got the face and the body for it. He looks like Theo James with a beard to give you an idea, he was just so hot.

But now he shaved his beard off and God... he looks different, completely different.

The beard gave him a nice strong jaw, made his lips look bigger and emphasized his cheekbones. Now the jaw disappeared,  barely any cheekbones and his lips look so thin. I was shocked when he surprised me, I didn't even recognize him. He looks... God I feel horrible but he went from a 10 to 5 or 4. I love him, i do but yesterday he tried to initiate sex and i just couldn't... I said I had a migraine, I lied. I have zero attraction to him right now. I know you're probably thinking how can he look this different but it really is a drastic change. It's like makeup for women, girl looks 10 with full face makeup but a 3 without it. It's exactly the same.

Im aware I probably sound like a shallow b*tch but I can't help it, it was an instant turn off, I cant force myself to be attracted to him. I just feel weird about it too, like idk. My mother saw him and agreed that he was not so good looking anymore, she was embarrassed to admit it and I feel like a cu*t for thinking or saying it. I know it would hurt his feelings, especially when he's so used to getting compliments. 

Obviously i didn't tell him what i actually think. I did tell him i like the beard better, that it's sexier but he said he likes not having one better and it feels cleaner and nicer to the touch. I don't think he will grow it back any time sooner. Ugh. 

I don't know what to do, I'm not gonna break up over this because there's more than just looks but I can't have sex with him. Whenever I look at him I dont feel horny or flustered, i just think ""omg how and why..."" He went from sexy Mediterranean GOD to under average looking dude with nice body and it sucks.",09Apr2019,3

72,"Typing on my phone so please forgive me for any spelling mistakes.

I just wanted to mention how I was never able to attend either of my grandfathers funeral. It makes me feel such like an unappreciative grandson. I will forever live knowing that I’m the guy who couldn’t see my grandparents for the final time.

My mother’s father passed away unexpectedly due to his HBP and his lack of taking medicine. I was only 12 at the time and I knew that if he died, he’s gone forever, but I was never able to see him for the last time. This happened when my family was in a financial crunk which only allowed my mom to go back to our primary country. The flight was expensive, and she got to pay respects to her father, but me and my brother were both left in the US with my father. It felt like there was so much more I could do, while at the same time, I knew I couldn’t do anything.

My father’s father passed away due to complications of Alzheimer’s recently. The only money I had was a little bit that I saved up from my internship during the summer. I used all of that money for my mom to be able to visit back to our primary country along with my dad to attend the funeral. I gave up every dime that I earned to let my parents fly back, but I never even got to say goodbye to my grandfather. It makes me feel so sick that I wasn’t able to say goodbye. 

They were both the most loving and caring grandfathers I could ask for. I still remember how my mother’s father would give us quarters to walk down the street to get some ice cream for me and my brother. We would appreciate him so much even though they were just quarters. He worked his life as a barber working his way up to cutting the president’s hair and I respected him so much. I still remember how refreshing the ice creams were.

My fathers father grew up poor but lived to be loving despite how little he had. I still remember when I asked him if we can buy pizza for dinner and as a child, nothing beats pizza. I saw him going through his wallet and digging through old cabinets to find enough money for me and my brother to eat while he would only take one bite. He was the most selfless man and I only wish I could even partly be like him one day. 

All this to say, I wish I could have loved my grandfathers way more than I did. I wish I could have shown them how cherishing they were to me and my brother.",09Apr2019,1

83,"I’ll try my best to describe it. Maybe also rant a bit.

I’m an introvert. I have about 5 close people who I talk to daily and that’s a lot for me to juggle everyday. I can’t imagine 10 people...

Once I wake up, I feel like people bombard me with messages. I usually have about 1-2 hours before I have to go to work and I have a difficult time multitasking. So I can’t get ready and message someone at the same time (weird I know). After work, I end up feeling drained. I have to be happy for the kids that I teach because their parents are around and watching them. My boyfriend and a handful of other people are still trying to message me and I just feel like it’s too much. 

I struggle so much trying to even things out. 

I want some more friends but I can’t do that because of how drained I feel. I sometimes struggle to take care of myself because I want to play alone for hours (I know...it’s bad).

Why can’t I be an extrovert? I would be a social butterfly but I’m too shy and I have anxiety when meeting and talking to new people. 

Someone has asked me if I ever felt “lonely” before. I still say the same thing. 

I don’t. 

I don’t understand how people can feel lonely. I don’t know the “feeling” of being lonely. I never had it because a lot of people try to talk to me. I never understood it because I feel at peace/happy when I’m by myself with no one near me. It baffles some people and even myself. I wish I didn’t have internal struggles. I wish I wasn’t introverted.",09Apr2019,1
85,"I tried writing the whole story, but then I remembered I wasn't trying to write a novel. So here's a short version. 

Mickey (my boyfriend) and Donald (my best friend) join a committee called the PC in college. For reasons that would take too long to explain, they ""have"" to be aloof to the rest of the student body to carry out their work. Mickey, being a BF, can't be like that to me. Donald treats me pretty horribly. I have a fight with Donald about this that lasts a year. During this year, new-to-relationships-Mickey says he wants his bachelor life back and breaks up with me. From September till March, it's a messy breakup because I tried being friends because he asked me to be and IT DOES NOT WORK OUT. In November, I text Donald about how I wish we were friends again, sorry and please come for your best friend (aka Mickey's) birthday party. He says no to all of the above. In February, right before college ends, Donald texts me about how he's feeling bad about the way he reacted to my apology and he also misses me. We make up and we're good to go. With Mickey, it's not so easy. He now wants to be friends on HIS terms - we shouldn't text that often (we can ONLY text now that we're going to two different cities and I hate calling. It's not like he'll ""grace"" me with his voice on call now, either), I can't expect him to spend time talking to me, he will decide when to reply, etc. The only mode of communication and he's shrinking it to the bare minimum. I tell him to fuck off. I'm not going to settle for being a best friend after I've loved him so much, AND on his ridiculous conditions. After HE broke up with me and HE wanted to stay friends and this is how he deals with it. I told him he can contact me again if he wants a relationship with me, but otherwise, we are no longer friends. Donald, in the meantime, has also started texting me whenever it suits him, replies after days and doesn't talk much at all. Oh, and also, these guys were introverted and shy when I became friends with them. Now, they think they're really cool and mature because they hang out with the older guys in PC who drink and party (and who have gotten them into drinking too. Note: Mickey knows how to drink, Donald does not, so Donald says things like, ""I'm an alcoholic now"" like it's a credit to him).  They also think these older guys are like family, although I've met them and they're not the type to feel likewise.

Now I wake up every day, thinking, ""They're so fucking entitled. They think they're so cool. They'll learn one day that their new friends are flaky."" I worry the most about Mickey - ""Is he going to meet someone new? Will he have sex with her?"" (We're both virgins) ""What if she has sex with him and he thinks she's so good that he wants to be with her? What if he actually doesn't come back? Worse, what if he does, and he's not a virgin anymore and he'll act like he knows everything? What if he does come back and he's a douchebag and he says that's who he is now and I have to accept him the way he is? What if really marries someone else and I have to see him with her at reunions?""

It's awful how every single day, I have these thoughts in the morning and I ruin my mood right away. I have these thoughts while I'm doing pretty much anything. I can't keep myself busy enough. I have two months before I start working, but I think I'll go crazy with these thoughts before then. I wanted to write out a text to Donald about how he's been acting weird to me, although I thought our friendship was back on track. But I don't want to fight with him again. I've noticed he comes up with convenient excuses now to avoid replying. Mickey did that too. I have a feeling they share notes on how to deal with me. I want to go to a counselor to talk things out, but I don't want to worry my parents by announcing I need to visit a counselor. They will try to intervene first and if I tell them it's about these guys, it's the standard response - ""Forget about them."" It's not that easy. Can someone please tell me what to do? :(",09Apr2019,2
86,"I’m packing my clothes for a 5 day trip to Cali and having a complete meltdown. I’ve gained a little weight this past year and nothing looks right. I’m ready to just not go but obviously I can’t do that, and why am I feeling this way when these are clothes I wear every single day?

88,"From Your Suicidal Wife

I know what you’ve just heard me say is a shock. Something that should make my skin crawl is on my mind and I can’t stop thinking about it. It’s like that itch in the arch of your foot as you scramble to pull your shoe off and scratch it. But that itch is ending my life and as each moment passes, it grows with intensity.

What I want to tell you is that I’ve actually been trying to tell you for some time now. I’ve written out a message to you several times, but deleted it. I’ve picked up the phone to call you, but hung up before I dialed. I don’t want to bother you. My brain is telling me that you are too busy and you don’t care. My brain is telling me that I’m being selfish to ask for your help. My brain is telling me to not send that message; delete it.

So what I’ve just told you has been rehearsed in my head a hundred times and typed out a thousand. I am gritting my teeth to scream for your help after being silent for so long. Please listen. Please listen to my scream as I whisper to you my deep dark secret. I have told you my truth that I have been holding in for so long. I have told you I have an itch. What I can’t explain to you is that this itch isn’t just recent.

It’s actually something much bigger than that. You see, since I was a child, I have been putting together a puzzle. I have been planning my own death and with each new found realization surrounding my death, I place another piece in place. As I settle on the location, the method, the time of day, my last letter and my will, I build my puzzle.

Unfortunately, as time has gone on, my puzzle has become stronger. Piece by piece, the details of my death become solid and I grow more and more content and comfortable with the idea. As my comfort and satisfaction grows, the danger increases and my dangerous puzzle threatens my life every waking moment. But you hold a piece; the most important piece.

You are ultimately what is going to halt the completion of my puzzle. Your refusal to allow me to put that piece in place is refusing to allow me to complete the puzzle and refusing to allow me to see my puzzle come to life. This is the last piece and you hold it in your hands.

I know that it’s a lot to ask. I am asking for your emotional labor and your time. It is a lot of me to ask of you to be so involved with my thought process and to swim in my emotions with me. I know it will be exhausting and sometimes you just simply won’t be able to do it. I know that you have your own emotions and thoughts to tend to and it is truly selfish of me to ask you to dip into mine but I need you to.

When you can, I need you to hold this puzzle piece tight. And I need you to battle with me. You have always told me that you support me in my battle with suicide so I am here to tell you what I need you to do. I am here to tell you that there is a battle to fight and that battle is me.

I need you to fight with me. I need you to tell me reasons to stay. I need you to remind me of my daughter’s face when she learns mommy has died. I need you to remind me of the years I would miss, the love I would miss. I need you to tell me that I’m not harming anyone and I am not a burden. I need you to tell me that it’s been a bad day and tomorrow will be better. I need you to tell me that the pain will pass, it always does. I need you to argue with me because I don’t believe it.

I may seem like a child, but my delusional thoughts are telling me that I am literally physically causing you harm by existing and the only cure to end your pain is to end my life. I believe that an imaginary woman will replace me and fill all the voids I will leave behind. This person is smarter, funnier, calmer, happier and acceptable, as I am a cancer of the earth only to be disposed of as soon as possible so I can allow my replacement to step in.

But I need you to remind me that you love me. I need you to tell me that I am valuable. I need you to tell me that no one will replace me. I am important, I have purpose. I know it’s ridiculous and I am asking a lot, but I need you to help me fight this battle with me. I need you to argue. I need you to find reasons for me to stay, even if it’s just one. Maybe my cat would go hungry without me or I would miss our son’s graduation.

I know it sounds childish but this is what I need. You hold this important piece of my puzzle in your hand and you can easily set it down and walk away. Many people have done this to me and I have had to fight the urge to pick up the piece and complete my puzzle. One day, I will not be able to fight that urge and I will put that piece in place, the puzzle will be complete and I will be gone.

Giving you this piece is asking a lot of you, I know. I don’t mean to be so demanding and to ask for so much emotional labor. But the reality is that this is how it is and this is what I need you to do. You say that you love me and support me in my battle with mental illness so I need you to act on that. I need you to fight alongside me.

So now that I’ve come to you to whisper my deep secret to you; the itch that I must scratch; my fantasy of my own death, I need you to not allow me to scratch it. Hold my hands and help me breathe. Tell me why I must not scratch it. Remind me that it will pass. I know it always does, but I’m just caught up in the moment and I’ve forgotten. I believe the pain will never end. I believe I am already dying from the inside out.

But your refusal to give me that puzzle piece halts the completion of my puzzle and forces me to continue to exist even though I have spent nearly every day of my life wishing otherwise. This incomplete puzzle, this scratch I must itch, haunts me every day. It is always there, though some days it is louder, but it is always whispering to me to do it. Complete the puzzle.

The message I’ve sent to you just now has been typed out a hundred times but I didn’t want to bother you, I know you’re busy. I know I’m not worth your time. But I’m begging you to please help me. I am drowning in the ocean and I have this one second to hit “send” or whisper to you my wish to end it all. You have this one opportunity to not give me the puzzle piece. You can refuse to allow me to complete the puzzle. You are what will save me from myself.

Maybe this isn’t a good time for you and you can’t fight right now, I get it. I know that you may have your own puzzle going on, and it’s a lot to ask of you to keep my piece. So I ask that if you can’t fight with me today, please hand it to someone else. 

Someone else may be able to fight with me today in your place and it’s okay, I’m not mad. I understand. But please don’t set the piece down and walk away. Because one day I won’t be able to fight the urge to put that piece in place and complete my puzzle. 

One day, my puzzle may be complete and then it’s game over. I will really believe that I am better off dead. The world would be free of me grip. I would truly be saving you from me.

So now that you know what to do, please know that I love you. And that’s why I’ve told you my secret today. That’s why I have reached out. That’s why I have finally dialed your number and told you about the missing puzzle piece. I know that it’s a lot, but your acceptance or rejection of this piece is life saving. So I need you to take this seriously and I need you to battle with me.

I need you to not allow me to complete the puzzle. I need you to not hand me the piece titled “No one really cares (they shouldn’t, I’m a loser) and the world is better off without me (because I am causing everyone pain). So I should just end it all; end all of the pain and suffering I experience and have caused as my life is trash to be thrown away and holds no value.” Your refusal to give me this puzzle piece is saving my life. So please help me today. Help me fight this battle. I need you the most today. You will be saving my life. You will be saving me from myself.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. I know that you are busy with your own battles to fight and your own worries to have. I know that I’m asking a lot of you to listen to me today and in the coming weeks, months and years. I’m asking for your service. But I love you and you said that you want to support me, so here is what I need you to do. I need you to fight with me and argue with my brain. I need you to battle.

89,"Soon I will be graduating with a degree in accounting and it has been one of the most grueling processes of my life. I've struggled with various subjects pertaining to the field and was certain that my GPA would prevent me from receiving any sort of offer from any employer.

I recently went to a job fair and had managed to set up interviews with multiple firms and companies (for an accounting major I've still managed to retain my ability to sell myself). 

Today I received my first offer as a staff accountant for a large company in my area and will be in contact with them later this week to negotiate salaries. 

I've worked fast food and retail since I was 15. I've worked every weekend, rarely took holidays off, and in my free time always pushed to study or better myself in some other way. I feel like all of this is finally paying off and I am beyond thankful.",09Apr2019,9

94,"i haven’t had any friends since high school. 4 years straight, just by myself. it’s pathetic.

every time i find plans with someone, i get my hopes up, and just end up waiting. and waiting. a painful, prolonged silence. no answers from the friend. just more waiting.

until finally they answer, just to say everything’s been cancelled. they say they’ll “make it up to me.” 

but every time, in the end, i wait.

more excruciating silence.

this isn’t life. this isn’t normal. what’s wrong with me? why can’t i live?

i’m tired of feeling this emptiness. i just want to feel human. i just want to feel alive.

do i not deserve that???",09Apr2019,1

96,"So I broke up with my girlfriend.

Constantly stressing me, harassing me and puts me into dilemma.  
Before breaking up I told her everything that makes me upset, so she freaked out.  
To be honest, in these 8 month of our relationship I loved her for 5 months. For my age of 19 years some would consider that quite a time.  
In the end I reflected:   
\- she was not really that attractive to me  
\- we did not have any common interests  
\- !!causing conflicts with my best and only friends!!  
\- when you´re having sex with the person you love, you would look at her. In her eyes AND at her body. But that was not the case. I just could not look at her body - as superficial as it sounds.

""Seeing the person inside the body"" is just one side of the coin. 

To sum up: I was not happy with anything, not even with the sex.   
In addition to that she has  no idea how life works: Her father comes back after 5 or 6 years. He wants to pay her rent but SHE signs the contract. So what happens when he just disappears again? I don´t need somebody who cannot accept the hard truth. I´m a mathematician (or more like becoming one in order to become a teacher) - being a rational-thinking person is necessary for me.

For my part: I needed this experience to know what a relationship means. It´s more than ""I love you"". Finding the perfect relationship is very unlikely but you still have to try finding that perfect one. Otherwise you won´t be happy on the long term.",09Apr2019,2
97,"Why does noise make me suicidal?

It’s getting worse and worse, I can’t cope with noise. My parents loud TV, them getting annoyed at me when I turn it down slightly, even though it’s literally making me suicidal. My neighbour snoring so loud that I don’t get anymore than 3 hours sleep every night for days on end. Loud music thumping. 

Why does it all physically pain me. Why does it hurt so much. My chest is agony. I nearly throw up. Why can’t I love noise. Why can’t noise make me happy. Why why why. I can’t fucking deal with it anymore. It’s making my life a living hell. I wish I could just turn my hearing on and off when I want. 

I’m going to end up killing myself because of noise. I don’t know why this is happening to me.",09Apr2019,2
98,"God help me.

I'm home alone, sitting at the top of my steps outside my room because a big black wasp is in my room, sitting against my window.

I was playing tekken 7 and went to get some popcorn. I stepped into my room and there that big shithead was. Sitting against my screen, not moving.

I grabbed my shoe and smacked the vicious beast, but he just got upset and smacked against the window.

I panicked, ran out the room, and slammed my door shut.

It was only 5 PM. My dad gets home at 7:30. Lord help me.

I grabbed a piece of paper and a cup. Built up the courage and strength to walk back inside. There he was.

The closer I walked, the faster my heart beated. I reached him.

I slammed the cup down. It bounced off and the flying beast smacked against the screen and unleashed his wings.

I ran out again, shut my door, and sat on my steps.

I don't know what to do. Spray him with a window cleaner, sit out here until dad gets home, or man up and get him in a cup (not happening)

All I wanted to do was play Negan in Tekken. What did I do in a past life to deserve this?

Lord save me.",09Apr2019,1
99,"I had a really bad day today and it made me realise how unsatisfied I am.

I'm an extrovert and most of my relationships were created by my own initiative. And along the way, it's become my role as putting the most effort in nearly every relationship I have (even with my parents! I had no chance of going through teenage rebellion). 

I don't believe most people realise how much it sucks to be an extrovert and being labelled as needy for craving social interaction. Being labelled as sensitive when it hurts to be rejected. Being labelled as annoying for wanting people to text back??

Is the secret to gaining meaningful relationships not caring? Being someone who's less ""easy""? Because I want more people around me that will go out of their way to spend time with me.",09Apr2019,10
100,"I want to preface this by saying that I don't think I'm suicidal at this point, but the thought of killing myself feels more and more rational every day. 

Title says it all really. I'm in a particular dark place and have been for the last two weeks because I've been trying so hard to be sober. Getting myself stoned all the time wasn't doing me any favours, but it was helping me hide things I didn't want to feel.

This shit's just getting worse and nothing really seems to help. I've gone through mental health services and it's felt very robotic and unhelpful. Some days I'm fine, but in general, there's a decrease in mood and pointfulness. 

Just struggling to really feel like I should care anymore. I feel like I've lost most important people in my life and that my life is just increasingly more meaningless and forgotten about. 

This is just always getting more confusing and I feel more alone with it than ever, and making more sense of it somehow simultaneously makes everything make less sense. 

Just fucking sick of it.",09Apr2019,1

103,"My son's teacher texted us photos of the rest of the class playing and my son looking sad at a desk behind them, so I asked him about it after he got home. He told me he has to sit at a desk by himself in the corner and the other kids all share a different table, and that it's been like this since Christmas.

His teacher communicates nothing. Last time there was anything about his behavior, she sent a text about him having a bad attitude yet neglected to mention that some kid in second grade slapped my kid across the face at breakfast that very morning.  I found that out when he got home and I saw his face. She literally said oops I forgot to mention it when I asked why I wasn't told. Wat?

How is ostracizing my kid in a corner for months without ever indicating a problem supposed to improve his ability to socialize with the other kids? Paired with the lack of communication, it just seems sadistic. Is she grooming him to become a school shooter, wtf? 

My kid isn't even bad, he's just grown up around old people and he's adjusting to being around kids his own age.

How do I handle this?",09Apr2019,2

105,"Here’s an interesting personal experience that happened to me a few years ago. I once dated a girl, we’ll name her Sophia, and about a year into our relationship we went on a double date with one of her friends (we’ll call Alexis) and her new boyfriend (we’ll call Jack). It was a rather strange night, to say the least. 

Before we go too far, I should be honest and say that both Jack and I have porn addictions. I’ve been trying to break mine for years, and thankfully Sophia has been a really big help with that. Sophia let me know (as told to her by Alexis) that Jack has the same problem and been working towards getting it fixed but hasn’t had much luck.  Alexis has been more on the side of “its disgusting, I don’t understand why he does that”, and not offering much, if any, help. It was also revealed to me that Jack had apparently looked at some the night before the double date, and Alexis found out so she wasn’t to thrilled about it. It’s kinda weird learning that kind of personal information about a man right before you meet him. Tonight was my first time meeting Jack. 

I drove the 4 of us in Alexis’s car that was missing its rear view mirror. We first went ice skating and at one point Alexis had to use the bathroom, and like usual girl fashion Sophia went with and Jack and I stayed on the court to talk. I tried to connect with this guy, but we didn’t have a ton of time to do so. He was a timid fellow, but he liked cars. That’s the biggest thing I remember about him. This wasn’t exactly a mutual interest we shared, but I came in with my limited knowledge. By the end of the night we had some ground work laid between us. Come to find out later, Alexis had ranted to Sophia about Jack and what happened the night previous. Sophia tried to reason with her a little bit, saying that maybe she should try to help him. But from what I heard, Alexis wasn’t really willing to get her hands dirty. And I don’t blame her too much, at this point they had only been dating for maybe a few weeks, so trekking through those waters would be a turn off for a lot of people.  Although, I know from personal experience that it sure helps.

Afterward we ate and then went back to Alexis’s place to watch a movie. I had been keeping my eye on the other couple all night, and I had picked up on some whipping directed toward Jack. Given how timid he was, it didn’t look like he was going to try standing up for himself anytime soon. All things considered, the night was good, a little weird but good. Jack and I had pretty similar personalities so we were able to bond reasonably well, tho there wasn’t much Tim to do so, he was more focused toward Alexis.   However, it wasn’t long after our double date that Jack and Alexis broke up. I can’t remember the exact reason, but I have an idea what could have caused it. 

Not sure why I’m telling this story, but there it is.",09Apr2019,1

107,"For reference Im in high school, me and my crush are both 16

I recently started having a huge crush on this girl in my AP Human Geo class. Compared to previous crushes, I feel more attracted to her and that we have better chemistry. We’ve had a lot of long conversations in the past about things like food, memes, art, and etc. We compliment each other’s art a lot and she gave me her IG @ also. She’s like the best person I’ve met at my school and is such a vibrant personality, like I can’t even describe. I know it may not mean much but in every long conversation she has made perfect eye contact with me. We do share some differing interests like music though. She’s more into KPop while I am into Hip Hop and R&amp;B. I don’t think that matters though.

I mean lowk i think im in but i don't want to get my hopes up too much otherwise I will fall hard.

She said she is going to prom but she never said anything about who so I assume she doesn’t have a date. Also she already bought a dress which I told her was cute. However I don’t want to come across like I just want to be friends, but I don’t want to come across as creepy because I did that in the past. Most of our conversations have been IRL. Also, I really want to ask her to hang out w/me over spring break but I’m also afraid of coming off as creepy.

Any advice?",09Apr2019,1
108,"I didn't feel like I was really important to anyone despite helping them out, being there for them, and even moving their stuff for them. So I tested it. I cut off/stopped talking to all my friends and family from Discord, Facebook, Snapchat, etc. On some programs they could contact me, I just wouldn't be in the chat room or would be AFK.

It has been a week, no one noticed a thing. I still see my friends playing, acting as if I wasn't there. Discussions continued on as normal. Even in my classes no one pays attention. My sisters don't talk to me and often ignore me. I recently eavesdropped on a joke where I was the punchline.

I don't give a shit if this makes me a jealous cunt. I don't give a shit how pathetic this is, I am. I don't give a shit if most people think these emotions are unwarranted. I hate life. He earned what he got in terms of his hockey career but fucking hell the rest is unfair.",09Apr2019,0
