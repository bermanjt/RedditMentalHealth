0,"I (19F) feel extremely selfish. I’ve travelled 3 times already this summer, I’ve passed all my subjects in my first year of university (I’m a mayor in pharmacy) and I’m free as a bird in summer, etc. I should feel okay, I should be taking advantages of everything I’ve worked for.

But I feel extremely lonely. When we don’t travel, we always stay at the beach. I’ve hated going since I was little, because I’ve never had friends to spend the time with. (I know it’s also selfish, which makes me feel shitty as hell, since not everybody has the chance of going away on summer). That, repeatedly every summer, alone with a huge toxic problem I had a couple of years ago with two girls that used to be my friends but ended up tearing me apart, I’ve just always felt like this even if I have people around me.

The thing is, I feel selfish for wanting people I see in instagram having fun to low key feel as lonely as I do? Today has been the first day I’ve met some people (not my close friends) but it’s felt amazing, I just needed this. But I won’t be able to repeat this until university starts again, and as soon as I’ve arrived home I’ve started to cry just thinking the feeling if loneliness isn’t going away for some time.

The selfishness I feel I want to be sure it’s healthy, I want people to enjoy as much as they can, but can I just have a my two, three closest friends to be with me, chill with me and try to get me at least. I know it sounds childish, but I don’t know what to do. Every summer it happens. It never goes away.

Can someone write some lines to help me appreciate the time with myself and avoid thinking avoid that feeling as much? I must take it out of my head or I won’t enjoy the rest of the summer time I have.

tldr; I feel both lonely and selfish for wanting people having fun in their vacations to somehow feel like I do. I need distractions or tips to feel less lonely",03Aug2019,1

3,"This story involves my last 5 months of my (not) sentimental life. 

It all started when I met this girl that I will name (for privacy) as S.

We knew each other at a party and then we started to text messaging when she broke up with her last boyfriend. Then we started to text a lot and then we also hanged out. 

After some months I was ready to tell her my emotions, but she did it before me, unfortunately she wasn't really into me. But she still liked me aesthetically, so here she suggested a deal: a ""Friendship with benefits"". 

Initially I wasn't too happy because she didn't ""return"" my same emotions, but then I thought about it and I accepted because I didn't (and don't, lol) have lots of experience with girls, so it could be an opportunity for each other. 

So we hanged out, initially very formal in a park, and we hooked up for all the afternoon, just to be more aware of each other, and to know each other better. 

After some days S started also to send me arousing photos, so I thought that the moment was getting closer and closer. 

We also found a place (a friend's second house) where we could do our things without anyone among us. (A DREAM!)

BUT, (obviously, there must be a but, why do you think I telling this story?) she restarted thinking about her EX, because he was very shy so she thought to restart to text him, hang out with him again because maybe he was still feeling the same sentiments (even after months). 

So, while I was asking her when to hang out again together, to go(you know) beyond only kisses, she was considering her EX love story. 

In the end, she (in a message) told me that I could have wait some weeks, to see if something could have changed. During all this time obviously I hooked up with some other girls, and also she did, so we were under a ""freedom"" and that's why I don't consider us as a couple. 

After these ""weeks"" she told me she wasn't really in the mood of a fwb, also because we will have the high school exams and we'll be both busy. That's how the my glory of a perfect friendship with benefits vanished.",03Aug2019,1
4,"I just graduated and am utterly miserable at my job, and am currently contemplating suicide. I feel the need to leave and that there is no way out of my current situation. I'm on the verge of breaking.

5,"Hey there, I'm kinda curious what someone's general opinion on me would be after getting to know me. Mainly dating wise. I'm a 23 y/o guy. Anyways, here's a list of stuff I do routinely throughout the week.

Gym/weightlifting 4 times a week
Muay thai or kickboxing 3 times a week
Saturdays I practice archery for a couple hours
Sundays sometimes I go rockclimbing indoors

I'm pretty active when I stick to my schedule. I have a meal plan I usually follow, so I cook most of my food. When I'm not working out, I play video games in my free time (PC). I also host Dungeons and Dragons games for my coworkers every now and then. Sometimes we will just play Catan though, or another board game during weekend nights, have a couple beers.

I'm generally into stereotypical geek stuff. Music wise, I'm into house/trance mostly with a bit of hard rock and heavy metal. I'd call myself a Ambivert, don't really go out to clubs and bars, but I dont mind it either. Rather stay in and play video games.

I've been recently trying to get into camping and traveling more once I save up some money.

I'm listing stuff off the top of my head, but I'd love to hear yall opinions. Thanks I'm advance",03Aug2019,1
6,"My ex husband and I separated June of last year and divorced this past April.  I have been a stay at home mom since I became pregnant with my first child at 21 years old.  I am now 30.  Prior to my first child being born I had only worked for a little more than a year at a couple different horse farms.  I suffer from horrible anxiety and any amount of change makes it much worse.  The past year has been full of major changes.  I was working with my doctor to find the right drug to treat it with not much luck until recently.  I feel better.  When my husband and I split up he told me two things:  No one will ever appreciate my body like he did (saying my body is destroyed because of pregnancy with his kids) and I would never be able to survive in my own.  He has since said he regretted saying those things but I will never forget it.  It made me want to prove him wrong.  The day I moved out I started going to the gym and eating better.  I went from 152lbs to 110 in about 8 months and I am strong as hell now. The next challenge was the job.  I would start to panic every time I would job search.  My resume does not look good and I have two children that need childcare.  I enjoy cleaning (weird, I know.)  so on Tuesday I said I am done being scared and went to a cleaning company in the next town over, filled out an application and got interviewed on the spot.  The next day I spoke to the manager and he said he would love to hire me.   The hours are m-f, 8am to 5pm.  I have applied for financial aid for child care and have enrolled the kids in an after school program at my gym.  They have a bus that will pick them up at school and take them there.  I also found a babysitter that can help when needed.  I feel strong.  I am doing it.  Proving him wrong.  The nervous part of me is still there.  This is another major change.  Going from no work to full time on the 12th of this month is daunting.  The scariest part is not being with my kids as much.  I do not have much help from their father and my mother does not help me besides letting me pay rent for us to stay at her house.  I am scared they will think I am abandoning them or something but I know I need to work to give them a better life, and myself a better life.  My next goal is to move out of my moms house into an apartment.  Maybe I will be alright after all.",03Aug2019,1696
8,"After dropping out of school, quitting my dead end job, then getting rehired at my dead end job, I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life.  The past few months have been me trying to find something I could see myself doing.  Several times a day, I find myself asking the universe to give me a sign. To give me a direction in life. Today, I think I found it.

&amp;#x200B;

While I was in my house, browsing Reddit, I heard the unmistakable sound of metal on metal and tires screeching, without a second thought I was outside attempting to render aid to the victims of a car accident. Out of the three people involved only a child was injured. I called 911 and used my basic first aid knowledge to help the kid, relay the best information I could to the dispatcher while also trying to calm the kid down, and defuse the situation between the drivers while they were screaming at each other.  The only thing at that moment that I felt was important was helping the injured, and after the paramedics took over, and the operator disconnected the call the adrenaline was pumping still and I realized. I want to be a Doctor. 

I enrolled in college early this year with this goal in mind, but had to drop out because I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. After tonight, I know now. There isn't a doubt in my mind that I want to be the person who see's people getting hurt and can jump in to help.",03Aug2019,3
9,"What it says on the tin. I can't figure out what's wrong with me. I think I'm attractive. I could lose a few pounds and I'm working on it but I'm still an XS in almost every store. I think I'm funny and interesting. I'm a little bit awkward but I've always had friends and a pretty active social life.

I'm not saying I'm a 10/10 but a few guys have crushed on me and I get a decent amount of attention when I go out so I don't think I'm THAT unattractive that I'm undatable. I've gone on dates with guys before but they always get really clingy really fast and I'm not interested in that. But then when I'm forward with guys that I'm into, they don't seem to feel the same way.

So yeah, I can't really figure out what I'm doing wrong that I can find a good guy to date me lol. Any help would be appreciated. It's a really lonely life and I'm kind of losing hope.",03Aug2019,2
10,"Allllllllright, in before "" this guy must be a criminal "" well kind of not really, just a traffic violation here is some background on the incident. 

I got unfairly dismissed from work a few months ago, my boss wouldn't explain why or even provide me the paperwork i needed. In the heat of the moment after denying defeat i got in my car and done a burnout, now at the time it felt great however it wasn't a pro move since well i essentially admitted to defeat. The boss got the CCTV footage of the incident and took it to the Police and well, i got served a court notice so here i am for the last two months prepping myself for court and only today i got really nervous. 

First time in court, and first time being in trouble with the law in all honesty. I'm nervous as hell, and even though my case will only go for 5 minutes i'm feeling it. 

Note to self: Stop over reacting, it's going to be okay.

11,"Another r/self, just for the sole fact that I still have things wrong, and things come up in life, like normal. So, I haven't felt like myself lately, and I'm thinking my body is trying to tell me to go do something other than play games.

I think that because I don't feel like playing my games. I don't feel like being on Reddit, unless I'm sad or want to help others, or something like this. I don't want to watch YouTube anymore. 

I want to talk to my friends, all of them are on vacation. I want to go outside, but I hate people, like a legit fear of people I don't know enough about, or have never talked to. I want to take a walk by the river near me, but the neighborhood kids bully me and the river has the park they always go too. I want to scooter, but the kids are also always scootering, I don't know how they do all of it at once. I want to eat healthy when I eat unhealthy, but it's the opposite the other way. I want to exercise, but when I do, I just want to stop.

13,"Growing up, my older sister was always deemed as the pretty one and I was always the ""studious"" one who was always behind the scenes reading a book somewhere. I never really got any compliments on my looks besides my hair so I just accepted that my looks would never be a big feature in my life and accepted the given role of being the ""smart one"" .

I thought my sister had it all seeing as everyone would automatically treat her nicer and give her things for free. It was like she was given this golden ticket in life that gave instant advantages.

But, as I've aged and become a young woman I realize that being attractive isn't all it seems. Somewhere past puberty I started to get a lot of positive feedback from peers and random strangers regarding my looks and over time I started to receive the same positive treatment as my sister did without having to do anything on my part.

At first this was a welcome experience, but now I  feel like I'm just fulfilling another role based off of the feedback and perceptions of others. 

I won't lie and say that some aspects of my life haven't been easier because of my looks. I guess I just hate that to a lot of people make assumptions about what type of person I am and how I should behave because of the way I look.


But I guess I'd be a hypocrite if I said that I haven't done the same. I don't really know where this post was meant to go, and now it seems kind of silly to complain at this point.

 I guess if there's one takeaway from this post, I'd say that it's: not to box yourself into the categories that other people try to assign you to and to also not box others into categories based off of superficial features. People are multifaceted and not just *one* thing.",03Aug2019,1

18,"I have a friend. I absolutely adore him in the same way I adore my other friends. The closest friends in my life are essentially my family. I am completely and utterly in love with them...

I was making plans with this friend (let's call Chris) for tomorrow. His girlfriend doesn't like me all that much? I knew that her feelings towards me fluctuated and I'm not too fond of her either (nor is Chris fond of my boyfriend, but our feelings towards our significant others are a separate issue)...

Anyway, tomorrow he's hanging out with her, but he also wanted to hang out with me. He asked if I'd like to hang out with both of them just alone. I reminded him of his girlfriend's feelings towards me (she said she hated me two weeks ago--- not to my face; to him) and of my feelings towards her. Then he said, ""Well, it's not that. She told me that she loves me and that's why she puts up with my nerdy stuff, but when were together, it's too much. She's very particular with people's personalities.""

This hurt me. He's not the one saying it, I understand. I couldn't really hold back so I asked him, ""Is there something wrong with my personality?..."" He said no and that he absolutely loved it (I would hope so, we're pretty good friends and I would hate if he was just putting up with me). But apparently... When we talk and she's around... I'm too passionate. Or too nerdy? And since I'm not her boyfriend, she doesn't ""put up"" with me. 

This is one of my biggest insecurities... Something I've been working on. A really close friend of mine in the last told me I was high maintenance. So I tried incredibly hard to dial down my passions and emotions. Chris is one of my closest friends. He makes me feel safe in my own hobbies and passions. He was apparently inspired by it. 
 
But... Hearing that tonight hurt me so much. I know it's not from him, but I'm reminded of how I am ""too much."" Or at least the insecurity was fed a gigantic meal. 

I'm sorry. I don't even know why I'm posting this. I was so hurt that I called my best friend. He couldn't pick up. I'm sure he's busy.

25,"When I was in eighth grade (currently a sophomore in college) we had a class assembly for our school trip. Every year, he eighth grade class got to go to Washington D.C. for 4 days. This assembly was just giving us basic rules, etc before the trip. My friend and I were sitting next to each other near the center of one of the two sets of bleachers. The assembly started at 1:50 and it went til the end of the school day at 2:45. Everyone was not really taking it seriously and talking through it, so the teachers had to keep stopping the presentation until we were quiet. As I joke I told my friend I was going to push him over when the assembly was done. We bantered back and forth, entirely joking about that sort of thing. Because they had to keep stopping the assembly, they didn’t get to finish it entirely. But when the bell rang all the kids just got up and left even though it wasn’t done. As I joke, I pretended to push him. He got pissed and actually gave me a hard shove. I’m on the chubbier side, so when I post my balance there was nothing I could really do. I went down on the bleachers as everyone was walking down. Instead of stopping or going around me, everyone literally trampled me. After our side of the bleachers was mostly empty, I saw my friend dying of laughter. Honestly, I’m pretty self conscious and it was a lot worse back then, so I didn’t want to admit that it was funny bc it was at my expense. If it ended there, it would’ve been whatever. But that’s the problem, IT DIDN’T.
 My friend told all of our other friends what happened, and they started calling me Trample Face. Every day, without fail they would always call me that instead of my name. A bunch of other kids heard it and caught on too. Pretty soon nearly the entire grade called me either Trample Face or Sole Face. I heard those two more than my actual name. I know it was just a joke, but it was super annoying and embarrassing. I was called that pretty much through all of high school. I heard “Hey Sole Face!” multiple times a day. My friends refused to let up for nearly five years ca, now matter how much I asked them to. 
      I recently got into college and made a ton of new friends. (Made a burner, cause they know my reddit) But the thing is, one of them found old comments about “Trample Face” on my instagram and asked me about it. I explained the whole story to him, expecting to have a quick laugh and not much else, but he thought it was absolutely hysterical. Now he told all our friends from school about it and now they all call me the names as well. 
     I put up with it for four years of high school because I could see the light at the end of the tunnel. But I honestly don’t know how much longer I can take it if it keeps going on. I have no idea what I am going to do.

TLDR: My entire grade called me an annoying and embarrassing nickname throughout all of high school and now my college friends found out about it and started calling me it as well.",03Aug2019,2
27,"My usual crew that I talk to about this stuff is busy enough but I really just wanted to get this stuff off my chest.

\[Context\] I've been pretty unhappy with my job for a while now. Following a really intense project in which I had to work a ton of overtime to save the companies ass on some compliance issues (in which I expected to be rewarded for very well), I received no reward whatsoever. That including no comp time for the 2 weeks worth of overtime hours I'd accumulated (although I'm exempt, I made it clear to my boss throughout that this level of effort came with a cost). I got through that project, and was assigned to a new manager (who I'll call Manager) from a different group in the org who is now reporting to my old manager (Director). That project was a jury rigged project to make the site compliant, and my current is a rebuild with more modern and maintainable tools, with a less strict time frame. I feel its important to note, During my first meeting with Manager, I made it very clear that appeal to authority is not a motivator for me, and that it was very personal to me because I was raised that way and have problems with Director because of it. That was at the beginning of June.

Due to the issues regarding the above project, my motivation has been lacking at work and I haven't been working as effectively as I had been. Not that I just stopped working, but that I've been procrastinating and not thinking clearly as I've reprioritized things in my personal life.

So this afternoon, Manager messages me to have our regular 1-on-1. I didn't realize he'd rescheduled for that time, so after arriving a few minutes late, we find a conference room and sit to talk. He basically starts grilling me immediately about why I haven't been closing stories - the other engineers are finishing their tickets just fine, so why arent *I* able to get mine done. I take this opportunity to discuss a change Manager had recently made on the team: After we rolled all of our tickets over into the next sprint (over the Fourth of July weekend with two engineers on vacation), he directed that we could only create tickets with three points or less^(1). This created a problem in which we were either lying about how complex a ticket is to try to to appease our product owner and fit it in the sprint, or splitting tickets into such small pieces that we didn't have proper context on how something needed to be used, so we had to redo work.  

\&gt; Manager: Yes, but this is how it works in the real world. You need to break the ticket down until it can fit into what you have, or accurately estimate how much work its going to be to refactor the code.

So right off the bat, He's saying my opinion doesn't matter because some ""real world"" strawman makes the wasteful decision to redo work and build *something* that isn't useful to anyone. I go on to explain to him that, having been working on this team for three years on complex sites \[literally the old version of this one 3 months ago when we had to rip it off it's skeleton\], I know that there are some features that need to be five or eight points because it doesn't make sense to break them into smaller pieces. The work I've been doing it a ticket that should have been one of those two, but we didn't point it accurately because ""eh, we can probably make it work with 3."" While I'm working on this complex ticket that was underestimated and who's dependencies were not designed for what I needed, my coworkers have been building the user facing pieces with already half-written code.

\&gt; Manager (paraphrased): I understand that, but you need to break down the ticket so that you can start showing progress. I don't think you're ready to work on five or eight point tickets, and if you want to be promoted to the next level, you need to start closing your tickets faster. 

This all came out over about 30 minutes, but I've been carrying it with my all day. I know that I haven't been putting my all into my work. I spent four months working 10am-11pm plus weekends to get a critical, understaffed project finished on time, performing three roles in one because Director refused to help. I need to catch up on the shit I've put off in my personal life, and that means my emotional energy is partially in other places right now. I've been working hard to make sure the new version of this application is significantly better, but he has refused to acknowledge any of my suggestions. He (as our team lead) has refused to enforce any of the best practices I suggested we use (which we agreed to). He has excluded me from all extra responsibilities outside that of a level two employee, after I busted my ass performing the role of a senior engineer, project manager, and technical lead. He insulted my ability to do my job, DESPITE that I built these exact features on the same project two months ago.

I'm just angry. I dealt with the same authoritative boss just before him with Director, and told him explicitly that I don't work well in that environment. Now not only have I not been rewarded for sticking my neck out for this company, but my independence has been withdrawn and I am simply a ticket processing machine. All that AND he insulted my ability to do my job to my face. I tried explaining to him that all new teams have the same growing period with estimating how much work we would be able to do, and my new team this time last year had the same issue not finishing work over the holiday weekend. That doesn't actually matter though, because I'm just not good enough to work on anything more complicated than a fucking html form with input validation.

Not to mention that he's primarily working on an entirely different team, so he doesn't see how much work we're doing.

I've been looking for other jobs for a while now, and have been focused more personally on doing more things for me (I'm hopefully adopting my first dog soon!!). I'm already settled on not seeing a future with this company, for even more reasons than just this. I just have never been personally insulted before about my ability to do my job. It bothers me that I have to go to work on Monday morning with a new distrust of the person determining my path forward (at a time when we're having layoffs no less). I guess I just don't know how to process that.

I don't know if I'm looking for validation here or just to vent but if you got this far, thanks for reading.

It started about 5 years ago when I met him. I had just gotten out of a relationship and I was just curious for the dating apps out there. I was never really looking for anything as far as a relationship, just to see how these apps work. From plenty of fish to hot or not, I had one of everything. Everything just for research until I stumbled his photo. Just him in a blue stripped shirt with him wearing headphones and smiling next to a speaker. I don't what it was but I was just drawn to him and so I swiped right and we were a match. I was surprised that he even swiped right on me too and even right now I can't remember who messaged who first, but I'm glad we did.

It was months of texting into the late night until after two cancelations I made the initiative of making a date to go out and seeing the new godzilla movie. We hit it off and we connected instantly and sharing out like of thing like HIMYM ( How I Met Your Mother, great show and would recommend to anyone). I took a risk like he took a risk in just seeking a kiss on my cheek. One thing led to another and we finally official.

Life was good. It was great. It was just perfect. Though there were thing that we could agree could be better. Like the distance. I was from the San Bernardino County and he was from the LA county. The distance was there, he didn't like it but I didn't mind it. I was from very sheltered Mexican house hold so for obvious reasons my pwdidnt like the fact I would go to him, when it was the man job to come to me. There are just some old traditions that I now see, more importantly, he wanted me see that there are just traditions that are just out of date and that's okay. Although to my parents, this was wrong and they still had there traditions engraved in me. Not all was engraved but there were times when I should have been on his side... There were many times when I should have been on his side.

I believe I was doing everything right. I thought I was being the best girlfriend I could ever been. I was never the jealous type, I gave 100% trust in him because if I didn't then what would be the point in being together. When he asked for help I gave as much help as I could possibly give. When he got into his motorcycle accident, I came every day and stayed till visiting hours were over when I was able to, but he still felt lonely or from what I knew now and not back then. I thought I was doing everything right. When we had our first big fight, it was because I didn't prioritize him. It didn't make sense to me at the time because I wasn't his wife or fiance. I was just his girlfriend. To prioritize thing in one's life, I was taught that it was family, work, friends and then yourself and I believe it. When I told him this he was of course saddened but I didn't think of him as a priority when I didn't know he had ME at the the top of the list. It shocked me. I had never been at the top of someone's list like that. I should have seen it sooner how much he was giving/ putting into us.

Our first anniversary came and it was like a dream and when we had our second it was like I was in heaven. I'm still baffled at the fact that someone tolerated me that long (in a joking way of course). I couldn't have been more happoer with him and I thought I was making him happy too. He would take me to new places, encouraged me to try thing that I would have never done. He pushed me to be my own person. There were things that I didn't see, well what I didn't wanna see...

After our second anniversary, which was the 6th of June on an early morning on labor day  like at 2 am early, we were together in bed sleeping. Which in context is a big thing for us since my old school parents didn't think it was right for a man to be in a lady's room. Plus they were gone for the weekend along with my sisters and we had the whole house to ourselves. Where we were, it was just pure bliss. I was happy and I had a guy who loved me. I never had a password on my phone and to be frank I never needed one because I had nothing to hide. I texted in front of him and showed him what I was texting because I would forget how to spell words. I was open nothing to hide, he had a password on his but I honestly didn't care because he did have alot of his life on his phone like the bank, school, and other stuff, but something in me just wanted to look in his phone. When I did, I think something snapped inside of me. He was talk to other girls. Photos were exchanged, words were said, just everything was wrong. I confronted him and he said that it was because of my parents. Which even now is an excuse don't accept.

The thing about it when I found out, I didn't break up with him. I couldn't for the simple fact of me not wanting him the satisfaction of him getting off the hook that easy. I just kept asking and asking what I did wrong. *side note we were kinda cross faded, he was worse though. We've never smoked before let alone edibles *. I kept asking him over and over again thinking that it was my fault, when I know when I told my friends about it, of course they told that it wasn't my fault, but I still didn't believe it.

Things just fell apart. Of course on the outside, but I was falling apart even faster and I didn't even realize how fast I was falling. There were trials and tribulations and they hit hard for me and him, the both of us really, but I still kept going because he made into something I never thought I'd be. A fighter. There were already so many thing that had happen to me in life, things that I can't even repeat, but we got through it. Made it through thick and thin, but I will not deny had still had a stain over my heart that just couldn't be washed because I guess I wanted that reminder . I wanted it there so I could never forget it so it wouldn't happen to me again and I guessed he noticed. He noticed and tried to do something about it, but it was never enough. In doing that, he also started to fade away to.

Just this passed weekend is when he ended it. It hit me, it hit me hard because I had never seen him this way before. I scared me and it angered me so much. I think it angered me so much that I think the thought of him quitting was something he swore he'd never do with us and I took it to heart. He told me that he was sorry he couldn't be better and that he was sorry for the burden he had cost me during these past 3 years. Yeah, 3 years, you read right. I mean why would anyone would stay after being shunned by their friends for staying with him, losing my best friend in the process, not speaking to my friends for a while year, almost losing my relationship with my mom and dad. I mean the logic isn't there, but didn't care because he was worth it. Yeah those 3 years were hard but I fought and worked hard to build those bridges, regain my best friend back and now I have a better relationship with my father, even after I had to have an abortion. Being from a Mexican catholic house hold, I committed the ultimate sin in there eyes and it broke me. I had no regrets because it wasn't time for me, for us to have this beautiful thing to come into this world. Not where me and him were financially and realistically. Every thing was like one hit after another but just like his favorite superhero Spiderman, no matter how many time I got knocked down I got back up.

He said he needs time to remember who he his, because he even told me that he's not the same man I use to love. I know he thinks that it's the logical thing to do and that it's the best. I don't accept that, I won't accept that. In that moment he wasn't the man I loved but I slapped that thought out of my head because I've said the same thing over and over to myself. He's still the same man. I just didn't reach out to him and that's my sin.... I am still the same me through out every thing I am the still the same old me. I've just had stuff in my life that happened and I had learned how to manage, process and if needed eliminate people who weren't right, and there was one person who I had drop from my life and I thought of her as a sister too.

The thought of him asking to do this alone scares me. We haven't talked to each other or seen each other since. I keep hearing those words, I need to do this on my own. You don't need to be alone because i shouldn't have made him felt that but I don't want him to ever feel that, but I did and I need to fix what I had done. I haven't give up on us, on him on myself. When I almost did..... I was standing on the edge of a hill crying, I was about to quit all together, but I didn't and thanks to that one person who he thinks his controlled by his emotions, metaphorically speaking of course, slapped sense into me that I think he has been trying to tell me but my anger and fear inside of me would let him through.

I want to see him and talk to him and tell him that I won't give up on us and that he doesn't have hold the weight anymore, but I don't know how much time should I give him with out making it to suffocating.

This took me on/off two days to write because of work and my need to not be in the house... Ahh this was mentally and emotionally strenuous to write and I kind hope that he would see this online cuz I know he will be online and just read words. Should I just take the gamble of going to him or waiting for him to come back when he's ready. Just the uncertainty... It kills me.",03Aug2019,1
32,"I am an omnivore, but I like to think of myself as an ""environmentally-conscious"" consumer: if I learn certain foods have a negative impact on the environment, animals, or people, I become mindful of what I consume. Environmental studies have convinced me of the impact that consuming meat has on the environment, as such I've chosen to reduce the amount of meat I consume. I did not stop eating meat because meat is still part of a healthy diet that plant-based diets have yet to fully achieve-like certain vitamins, minerals, and proteins (plus, meat is delicious).My concern for the environment is not just about meat, it's also about many other plant-based diets/foods. If a certain type of food has a negative impact on the environment, animals, or people, I will stop eating it (or more likely, limit consumption).

The previous sentence is what my question is about, particularly at vegetarians and veagans-the primary plant-based diet consumers and proponents: **If you knew that a certain crop was negatively impacting the environment, animals, or people; would you stop consuming the crop (or at least reduce your consumption of it)?**The best example is avocado: the amount of water that it requires to grow and produce fruit is astounding, is grown in climates not suited for the trees, and in Mexico drug cartels have taken over many avocado farms and fields; they use the income from avocado production to continue funding their criminal activities, and have used violence against citizens to steal and maintain control of avocado production.Almonds are in a similar position: they require a lot of water to produce. The processing of almond (and other foods) also make me conscious of their impact on the environment. Almonds already require a lot of water to produce, but to make it into milk or yogurt, you need more water and more energy to process them into such products (admittedly, almond yogurt is good). This includes other processed foods such as coconut oil. Wouldn't it have been better to consume them in their natural unprocessed state?

**Let me put it this way:** if water is becoming a dwindling resource and you had to choose between watering an acre of lettuce or an acre of avocado, which one is much more environmentally sound? Remember, avocados require a lot more water than lettuce. **Another example:** if tofu is the primary choice for protein and imitation-meat, would you still consume it even though it's causing deforestation because of global demand? Keep in mind, your consumption determines which crop farmers will produce. I really want to know your responses, as I am genuinely curious about this topic. Omnivores like myself are also welcomed.

**Finally:** please, please don't say as your response ""meat is still more damaging than plant-based diets"". Whenever I've wanted to research this topic, this sentence is always mentioned by authors and commentators alike. I know the impact that livestock has on the environment: I am not asking nor comparing livestock to crops. I want to know if you would stop eating certain crops if they have a negative impact on the environment, animals, or people. I've heard that sentence (meat vs plants) regurgitated so many times that I start to doubt a bit the validity of such a statement. I feel that it has even become more as an excuse to continue eating said food without considering the repercussions it can have on animals, people, or the environment.

33,"This year I have been mostly down a lot of the time, I have lost a lot of my interest, there were days where I realized just how much I missed the feeling and how it's been missing, there were times when I was so down that I didn't feel like eating and sometimes I had only one meal a day I also had days where I couldn't fake a smile.

I have been thinking a lot about the way I used to be happy where I did have down days but I would be back to normal the next day, throughout the last few years I felt that feeling slowly slipping away and this year it took a turn for the worst, I was used to being down 1-2 times a week at night but now it seems like I am down most of the month and I begin to wonder if I ever will be happy with myself, everytime I am close to believing I won't something happens, two of the things that happened was when I did feel like I was at my worst back in May I got a message from two of the people I miss most my Uncle and Aunt who I hadn't seen in almost 2 years at that point, and it made me feel happy for a few days, the 2nd happened yesterday I woke up to a different feeling where I knew good things were going to happen, I got one of the nicest messages from one of friends, and right after I got a message from my cousin who I haven't seen in two years asking if I could come to dinner, and after that I found out my foster parents decided to adopt a dog and I miss our previous one like crazy, it seems like good things come when I least expect it.

36,"Today was a rough day. I was unemployed for almost 6 months this year, and really set myself behind financially. I got paid today, but after paying some necessities (credit accounts, loans, gas, food, rent that I'm already months behind on) and bringing my account positive I have almost 0 money left. I paused my entertainment expenses, so hopefully I won't over draw my account this week. In addition my roommate/landlord was able to take less money than we had previously arranged.  

I accused my best friend/ roommate (different person than above) of wanting to stealing some weed from me. My sister has been gracious enough to buy weed for me from time to time, as long as I pay her back eventually. I had previously caught this roommate two different times stealing from me, and then lying to my face when I called him out on it. I caught him once with a webcam, once by weighing my containers, and this time I had set a motion detector over my lock box where I now store my stuff. It went off when I was at work today. I had put a note in the container specifying the exact amount I had. Nothing was actually taken, but his excuse raises some eyebrows. He opened my closet door (where I store it) so that the house wouldn't smell as bad (yeah, but my clothes would). The house has smelled like straight stunk before, and my housemates are totally cool with it. I'm inclined to believe him as strange as it sounds: he did acknowledge that he was the one that made me not trust him by lying the previous two times. 

I had connected with a woman on a dating app a few weeks ago. We had some decent conversations and we finally went on a first date on Sunday. The date was nothing incredible, but overall I had a good time talking with her. I texted her soon after the date letting her know I had a good time, and that it was nice to meet her. She responded similarly and with a smiley face at the end. She's said 4 things to me all week. Yesterday I cancelled my weekend plans to go out of town this weekend. Today I asked her if she wanted to spend some time together this weekend. I got no response so I offered the easy out of explaining that it takes a while for me to open up to others. I've built a shell and I'm starting to outgrow it, and I understand if this is where our paths diverge. Still no response, so I think that is my response...

  I made plans with an old coworker weeks ago for today. We confirmed the plans early in the week this week. Today I let him know that I couldn't afford to treat like I thought I could a few weeks ago. He offered and we settled on a bowling alley in my town. After work today I asked him if he could reschedule to tomorrow, because I was having a bad day. He asked me if I was going to bed ""soon"" (it was 6pm), I said no, I just had a cup of coffee. He was out doing errands, and would let me know when he was done. 8:30 rolls around so I shot him a message asking him when he was thinking and that I didn't have much gas in the tank to make it past 1030, it was getting late (I've been up since 5). He said that he'd be in town at 915. That's not what I had in mind in the slightest (all of our other get togethers had started between 6-7) and then asked to raincheck again. He said that he had to do a lot to make my town work. I was in bed at 945.

I've really put a focus on improving myself with the time I was away from work. I took a vacation to Vegas all by myself, just to put myself out in the world a little bit more. I've been trying to socialize more, and being more confident in myself. I've already seen massive growth, but I still have a lot of my shell left. I hate talking about myself, and I'm unable to feel any intense emotions, let alone express any emotion. Life is more simple when you're by yourself, but I don't want it to last forever. Today, I just want to be by myself. I am the cause of a lot of the shit that happened today, from money, to accusing the roommate of ""wanting"" to do something but not actually doing it, to the situation with the woman I went on a first date with.

39,"  I’m really just venting more than anything, I think. I have no one else to talk to about this and it’s bothering me. 
  He was the first one the say “those words,” even though I spent a few weeks trying to figure out how to tell him that I was in love with him. Our relationship has been relatively amazing, honestly. We’ve had to have serious talks, but we’ve been better for it and our relationship has definitely been the healthiest I’ve ever been in. 
  Lately he’s been MIA. I’ve asked him to hangout or stay the night with me, but he always declines. He invites me over if I get upset to hangout at his house, but we spend the whole time with his roommates and I end up feeling like a third wheel as they talk about inside jokes, friends they’ve made at school, and things they’ve done together. We rarely spend time alone together outside of sex, which is great but I miss him on a personal level, considering I very much consider him one of my closest friends. Tonight, we were supposed to hangout and play video games before he flies back home for a couple of weeks. I was supposed to stay the night, and considering how hard life has been for me lately, I was very excited to be able to wake up and spend some time with him tomorrow before work. 
  Instead he texted me half an hour before I got off work, telling me he decided to hangout with friends for a while and that it would be late. He’d “keep me posted.” It’s been two hours. I feel like I’m the least important thing to him right now, and it’s kind of crushing me. I do love him, and I do try to give him his space but I feel like he doesn’t really want anything to do with me anymore.. 
  I don’t know what to do. He tells me he loves me, but I just can’t keep myself from doubting him. I don’t want to bring it up to him yet because my feelings are still raw and I don’t want to seem like a crazy person that’s trying to take away his freedom and independence. I’m just scared because both he and our relationship are the first things that ever really made sense for me, and I’m so afraid to loose him.",03Aug2019,2

43,"This is crazy and is the first time that something like this had ever happened to me. I’m currently locked in my room with my Maltese dog trying not to cry. Guess my paranoia is taking over me.

My parents are out of the country with my sister  and I stayed in my house due to university. The thing is, we have a stay in housekeeper who helps with the house and all that and is staying in my house with me, I’ve told my mom to leave me alone in the house and that there was no reason for the housekeeper to stay since I’m already 21 but she didn’t like the idea of me being alone in our two story house. Either way, the housekeeper is leaving for good tomorrow once my parents arrive, and she kind of grew fond of me and now is sad. Also, she has personal problems so she is currently in a difficult situation. I feel bad for her. Anyways, what the current situation is...

Every night I go out to jog around 8 and 9 pm and arrive to my house around 10-11ish, today was no different. When I finished jogging I told the housekeeper that I arrived, but she was not answering and I was okay, she fell asleep. Until I went to the kitchen and saw her drinking my dad’s vodka(he usually puts it in a locker for special moments) I didn’t know what to do, I was at first in shock at what I found and in lost of what to do. I asked her why she was drinking and she started to cry and talk about her personal issues, and also acting weird. She started to talk to me as if I’ve known her in my entire life  (She has been working with us only for 3 months!)  She also kept talking that she didn’t want to leave, that she wanted to stay and continue working with us, but I didn’t know what to do for it was the first time something like this has ever happened to me. I don’t know how to handle drunk people, and I’m also kind of terrified of them for I don’t know how they will react or act. When she went to the bathroom, I quickly grabbed the vodka and hid it then took the house and my room’s key and put them on my pocket. Once she came back, I gave her a glass of water to dissipate the alcohol (if it works) and told her that I am going to sleep because I am tired and that she should to because she clearly needed to rest. She asked me if I was sure and I told her yes, just go to sleep.

After I made sure she was on her room I ran upstairs, called my parents and told them the situation, also I wasn’t feeling safe. Probably I am overreacting, maybe I am being stupid, but I really don’t know well that housekeeper and for some reason she grew fond of me, got drunk because she is leaving for good, I don’t know what type of “drunk” she is, and I am on my own.  To be honest, I am scared. Probably because I think she will attack me on my sleep, stab me, or something. (Reasons why I took my room key) I know that’s too much, but like I don’t know what to do. The thing is, I don’t feel safe, I don’t know if I am safe. My parents know about the situation, but they are out of the country. My best friend who lives in the community is asleep, and I can’t just leave my own house with someone who is not conscious and doesn’t know what is doing. I am locked in my room with my dog, and I am in the verge of barricading my room because I fear for my safety. Probably I am overreacting but I am terrified. I don’t know what to do, I can’t even sleep.

I love how personal and included it makes me feel, I don't think about my hollow family, or how I have friends that never want to talk to me, the sad stuff everyone has. I just forget it all.

And I've used it to forget my life, it's not all that bad when it was never worth much. I would daydream about streams and videos that I would watch, I would pretend to have conversations with the streamers, it filled the social hole I had in my chest.  I mentioned I'm homeless so you can understand what happened next, quit my job, stopped paying bills, just giving up on myself as a whole. I spent every dime on weed, food, and to keep the web up.

The short version, in case you don’t care about context:


I don’t care about anything. I have no passions. I’m indifferent to everything except moderate levels of discomfort. 
I have no purpose 
I’m a 30 year old man.
Born in the US.
No high school diploma. 
Depression, agoraphobia, dissociative disorder, panic attacks, anxiety, a marginal will to live.
Only one family member (mom).
Only one friend. (Lives far away in another state)
I have warrants for tickets that I couldn’t pay for because I was jobless and homeless, sleeping on the streets. 
I generally don’t like being around people. 
Everything is just a distraction until I die. 
I have no money, no car, no job, chronic back pain from a bad accident, and no valid license. 
I live with my mom on a couch that makes my back worse. 

What do I do? 

Side note. Please don’t tell me to “find something that I like”, or “find someone”, or “find a passion”.. I generally don’t like anything, I generally don’t like anyone. I haven’t experienced the feeling of “happiness” since I robo tripped. I don’t experience feelings the same way as most people. That doesn’t help me. 


Long-ish version 

At 14 I stopped caring about life. I realized that life was vacant and nothing mattered. I was just waiting to die.. I stopped caring about school.. I’d just sleep in class and cheat on everything to pass. At 17, I was kicked out for doing something dumb. A month later, my brother introduced me to weed. The second time we smoked together, we smoked weed coated with robitussin and I robo tripped for a month. I had a massive panic attack once every 10 minutes of my awakened life. Very bad dissociative disorder. I had literally no feelings or emotions of any kind. I was basically a zombie trapped in my body. I couldn’t sleep for days at a time. My agoraphobia was also much worse then. It’s gotten significantly better since then, but I still struggle with all of this to this day as a 30 year old man. 

I don’t care about anything except not dying. The only reason why I’m still alive is because I fear death.. I’ve worked pointless jobs to survive. I was homeless last year (2018) for 5 months. 40 days of that was on the street. I survived on cans of beans and water from Starbucks. I slept in fast food restaurants, on benches, under benches, on an apartment roof, and a stairwell. The rest of it I slept in a car. One month in my car until it got repo’d, four months in my friend’s car. He was also homeless for a couple months with me. I have warrants for my arrest for tickets that I couldn’t pay. I have no money, no job, chronic back pain from a bad accident, and no valid license. 

What do I do?",03Aug2019,2
50," Let me know if this doesn't belong here, I'll remove it. (I'm on mobile, sorry about formatting)

     I (F) am in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend (M) who lives about 10 hours away. It has been going for roughly 10 months. We both are young, and so neither of us have the means to visit each other quite yet although we were planning a trip for next summer.
     Now, I never lies about who I am. I am alwiays very honest about myself, and we do video call every day. I am overweight; about 200lbs and 5'5 (I know, I know). I have told him in the past that I'm fat, but never told him exactly how much I weigh when questioned- I may have implied that I weigh about 180 pounds though. I'm not a liar, and I feel awful about this lie, but my way of justifying it to myself was that since I am in the process of losing weight, I would weigh even less than that by the time we meet up.
     Now, here's the problem. He doesn't like fat people. Not at all. And I don't really blame him. In the past, he has said things like ""you're not that fat, otherwise I wouldn't like you"" and ""I wouldn't love you if you were 230 pounds"" 
     Now here's where the problem gets even worse. He and his family are coming on a road trip, and will be about a 4 hours drive from me. I want to meet him, as I love him, but I'm absolutely terrified. I know that if he knew how I was in real life he would never have loved me. (He has seen pictures of me but they are all carefully angled and such, I look better in pictures). 
     Am I a catfish through omission? Do I tell him? If so, how? I feel really awful about this, any advice is greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: I lied through omission to my long distance boyfriend about my weight, now I may have to meet him before losing the weight. What do?",03Aug2019,2

53,"I don't know where but I feel like I need to just cut all contact with almost everyone in my life, abandon my job and responsibilities and just drive somewhere far far away. No I don't have any plan for what to do once I get there or even where I want to go. I live in Wisconsin so probably somewhere on either coast, I really don't know. Maybe Maine -- I've always wanted to go there, it isn't too expensive and it's really far away. 


If things go terribly then whatever, at least I will have tried something. My life is so terribly unbearable that it's feeling like literally anything would be better than this. At least I'd get to see new places which I've hardly ever done. I've been feeling so close to suicide for so long that it really doesn't seem like there's any option besides ending my life or doing something crazy like this in a last ditch effort to enjoy something.


If it doesn't work out and it's shitty still then I still have the option of giving up. It seems crazy but it's honestly hopeful of me to want to do this. It'd be me giving life *one* last chance. If I'm this close to ending my life and I literally haven't enjoyed a thing in years then why shouldn't I do something impulsive and crazy? The chances of my life getting better under my current circumstances are 0, so I want to throw one last hail Mary and if through some miracle that makes me feel better than I'll stay but if not then oh well.


Thanks for reading, if you did. I feel like my posts aren't usually seen, especially since I haven't been able to post on /r/depression or /r/suicidewatch for unknown reasons (just messaged the mods for a *fifth* time).",03Aug2019,4

(Wanting advice/ someone to talk to about it is all, not sure if this is the right sub)



I wasn't even high or drunk or anything, it was all my own decision and all my fault. 

It started out as me jokingly creating a dating profile on some sites, but I did post real pics of myself. I was just doing it for the attention, which is already bitchy in itself bc I was basically taking advantage of these dudes loneliness. Then I got some money offers, like BIG money, and after a while of me hyping myself up and deluding myself into thinking it was okay, my train of thought led to me wanting to actually meet one of these guys.

The whole time I was getting ready I kept thinking, 'this is ridiculous, you can just back out now, just walk away, just tell him nevermind, even ghost him if you can't deal with it, just stop doing this'

But I didn't.

He picked me up in the neighborhood next to mine as I didn't want him knowing where I lived (not that it would've even mattered bc he could've made a fucking skinsuit out of me as soon as I got in the goddamn car). He was nice but a bit awkward, and took me to a steak place where I couldn't even finish my favorite ever meal because I was so nervous. Then he took me to a hotel, and we got a room, and things happened.

I want to be clear, he wasn't creepy and he didn't force me to do anything, I got lucky with that at least. But somehow that makes me feel even more like shit, because I can't say I was raped for being really really stupid; I can't say or believe the punishment didn't fit the crime. It was my choices and mine alone that led me to be losing my virginity to a total stranger more than three times my age for some fucking steak and candy. I was planning on asking him for some money when the time got around to it, but I was so flustered I didn't bring it up, hoping that he would. So now instead of being a prostitute like I had planned, I managed to take it further and sell my body for even less.

A couple hours later I was at my dad's friend's house party pretending nothing had happened. During that party everything felt so surreal, and I kept wavering between feeling completely indifferent and nonchalant about the situation to being on the brink of exploding in tears.

The dude kept contacting me and me being the idiot I am I still responded for a few days, until I just couldn't anymore. I know it's shitty but I ghosted him, although not before I had told him how bad and shameful I felt so it probably wasn't unexpected. I deleted his contact immediately when I decided to stop talking, as the longer he existed anywhere on my phone the greater chance he would be discovered, and I don't want to ruin some dudes whole rest of his life because  I lied about being underage.

Losing your virginity is supposed to be nice, or fun, or at least with someone you actually like. I feel like a piece of shit, but I've stopped crying about it for a while now so I've either accepted it or spiraled deep into denial or numbness.


 I haven't told a soul until now, not my family for obvious reasons but not even my closest friend in the world. I guess I'm just wanting advice or condolences or maybe just attention, which is what started this whole stupid mess... I want to scream or do something but I can't.

60,"Every time there's some major shift in the status quo of my life I get this sort of anxiety about it. It's hard to explain exactly what it feels like but it only ever appears in the weeks leading up to some kind of paradigm shift. Last time it happened it was my friends breaking up after living together for four years. Before that it was all my friends moving out of the apartment we all shared, over the course of a few months or so.

I don't know what's going to happen this time, and for all I really know nothing will. But I don't think I've ever been wrong before. I'm impossibly stuck in the associated emotions. I can't stop thinking of the music I've been bracing against it with. Maybe it's something to do with having gotten stoned every night for nearly the whole past year, and now being out of weed with no dealer and the having let this slowly happen hoping it'll force me to get my shit together. I'm already starting to do that anyway. Maybe that's got something to do with it, but I feel like it's maybe something more.",03Aug2019,2

She feels like I don’t really call her and text her anymore and I take forever to respond because she thinks I ignore her message. She felt like she should know if I’m going AWOL.  I felt so bad when she sent this message because I felt like this was going to happen. And I just felt so bad because I had a lot of stuff I was going through and I felt it would be easier to just ignore my phone and avoid responding. I finally told her what was up and it was so good to finally open up and tell because I’ve been holding it in me for like a year. I felt really happy.

But the moment I was done with the conversation I felt regret sharing so much. I was thinking to myself why did I have to come up with a whole sob story. Why couldn’t I just accepted the criticism, apologized and move on? Now I’m mad at myself for sharing so much but also I acknowledge that felt realy good. Like I’m a good friend usually and I really appreciate listening and talking about personal stuff but I hate telling ppl personal stuff about me.

63,"So I'm 20 years old male and I've been looking for a serious relationship for 2 years , I've broken up with 2 girls because we didn't have the same interests and I was in a relationship with a girl who she though we were just friends(ouch xD), I'm usually socially awkward(I'm not shy, its just that I don't what to say,sometimes I say unappropriated things at the wrong time) but I'm slowly getting better but that's not my problem with my relationships according to the women I dated or I tried to date, I'm not quite sure what's the problem, I'm still trying to figure that out, but today for example I managed to screw up things with a girl who has my same identical interests(educationally,hobbies etc) who is a beautiful, she is weirdly different than all other people(just like me), and we can understand each other.
But this time I knew where the problem, and I don't know how to fix it. So right now she is a waitress at a restaurant I went to and at the first day I couldn't ask her out because my friends were with me.On the second day I went back alone and we talked for a bit she told me some personal stuff about her and I made her laugh multiple times and that's where it went all south, when I asked her out she was laughing (not in a mocking way) and shocked at the same time(she was like damn you're straight forward) and I told her she can think about it and I'm not trying to pressure her, so I gave her my number on my receipt and she laughed and told me ok I'll think about it,I went back to reading my book(I was reading a book before she came) and after about 5 mins she came back laughing and asked me ""you mean as friends right?"" At that moment I felt my heart shrinking and warming up,I've never felt that before except when my grandmother died, and then I responded to her normally and confidently ""depends on what you're looking for"", and she replied ""I already have a partner"" at that moment I started panicking and I think she noticed it, so I replied ""yeah sure, It's not a problem I just figured I ask u out because we have the same interests"" she said interesting and laughed and we said goodbye and then I left, on the next day I couldn't stop thinking about it I started to overthink every little thing I did to ruin this,and I'm really mad that I'm still thinking about a girl who is happily in a relationship, and that I even screwed up being friends with would've been one of my best friends, she still hasn't texted or called me.
I just wanted to express my self because literally nothing is working for me in my life and I could've used this relationship (romantically or not),my friends are in college and I don't see them at all, my family travels a lot and there is only 2 friends that I talk to and they're not always available and they don't talk about emotions, and I feel like I'm hitting rock bottom.",03Aug2019,1

66,"I (22f) stopped talking to my bestfriend (22f) of 6 years in November of last year (2018) and til this day, I wonder if I was to blame. We also had mutual friends, which I had also been friends with for years but contact stopped once my bf and I stopped talking. Our relationship began to fail once she started to hang out with a new group of friends. She introduced me to them, I got along great with them and I enjoyed hanging out with them as well but as the months went by, I felt like they were ""fake"", as not being real friends, just party friends. My bf started acting different as well, she started drinking alot and thats all she wanted to do when we would hang out. She also would hang out with her new friends more and invite me less and If she did invite me, she would ignore me the whole time I was there. I confronted her and she told me that she was sorry I felt that way but that she didnt see it that way but that she would try to include me more, but she didnt. During November, I also had a depression spell which I told her about but she showed little support towards me, which led me to stop reaching out to her anymore. Our mutual friends also stopped talking to me, which basically left me friendless, in exception for some outside friends I have but have never been super close to. I was able to get out of my depression with the support of my family and my boyfriend, but to this day, I continue to miss my old friends, especially my bestfriend. It makes me sad they never talked to me again or even asked me if something was wrong but it makes me wonder if maybe they were never really my friends or if I was the ""toxic"" friend?",03Aug2019,2

69,"When I was growing up, my father was a snake breeder. He had all these really exotic and beautiful snakes and I always wanted to have my own when I grew up. So I grew up a bit and finally decided to get myself a snake, now I picked out my snake, I got a cute little albino corn-snake, since it was my first snake just to learn the absolute basics of taking care of snakes, so I got him a nice big 20 gallon tank and I decorated it with fake leaves and tree branches (Wich he loved to climb on and hide and occasionally take a break in the shade) I got him a nice warm heat rock, a big bowl of water for him to bathe in if he please and all the other essentials. I loved him so much, and that was because he was mine and he depended on me to take care of him. Forget to mention his name was snakey, creative I know. And so I had him for a few weeks and everything was amazing. He was eating and drinking, sunbathing on his heat rock and we were both bonding. I would hold him in my hands and let him slither around on the floor, I’d even set up my old toy army soldiers and let him slither through the trenches. But then it happened, after a long day of playing with him, I decided to go to sleep finnaly, I drifted into a very peaceful sleep and had a nice dream where I was playing with him some more, but then he slithered away and he got away from me and all I could do was fumble with my hands to try and keep him with me but he got away, and so I awoke from this nightmare and I go to check on him just to make sure he’s ok. Now keep in mind I had the top on plus both lights (night heat light, and daylight light) plus some books to make sure it couldn’t be moved at all. So when I go to check on him.....he’s gone, he’s nowhere to be found, just poof. Disappeared from my life, that was the last time I saw him. I looked all over all night to try and find him, under every piece of furniture, in between every nook and cranny but he was just gone. I was very upset as I’m sure you could guess, I left his water bowl out Incase he got thirsty but I couldn’t leave any food out because I had just fed him the day he dissapeared. I called my parents and asked what could’ve happened because the top was still on when I woke up to check on him, with the books and everything else in the same place I left them, but nobody knew.

It's been raining hard outside for a few days and I love the weather. The sky is gray and the wind is cool. The one thing I really like about it is the temperature. I'm just sick and tired of the scorching heat that drains you out if there's no airconditioning. If I were to choose between really hot and really cold, I'd choose the latter because heat is like a disease but in the form of weather. I really despise hot places because all my life I've been living in a hot place. I've been finding it hard to write in my mind today. I was thinking of what I should be writing here so I can have a general idea of what to type later. But, it seems like I'm finding it more difficult. Is it because I lost the motivation I had in the beginning? Or maybe writing just isn't for me? Or maybe I need to start reading some books again? Idk. I still feel like my sentences don't flow well. Everything's just so different now ever since I stopped speaking english. I mean I still think in english but i speak in filipino.

77,"I’m going into my freshman year of high school, and have been doing band for as long as I can remember. Marching band, jazz band, concert band, private lessons, etc. This summer I tried acting for the first time in my whole life and absolutely loved it. It was at a camp in the town next to mine, and I made a bunch of really good friends in said town, as well as already having some before the camp.

Anyways, my town is not known for acting. It has a really good music program. However, things are taking a turn for the worse and there are budget cuts negatively affecting the program. I’ve been going to school in this town for basically my whole life.

The town I went to camp in is known for having an INCREDIBLE acting program, with a worse band program. I really like the people there and the school system is great.

My parents are giving me the option to move to this town, and go through all of high school there.

A close friend of mind and I had a very long very philosophical discussion about friendship tonight. And I have to say hes challenged my viewpoint considerably, to the point I'm asking all of you. To keep it brief, I have an ex girlfriend whom I consider to still be a good friend. We broke up because she cheated and drank too much. However the breakup was amicable because I also cheated and was using drugs heavily.

It's been about 6 months out now and shes asking to have dinner with me and my new girlfriend, and her new boyfriend. 

I'm skeptical about this for obvious reasons. So I went to my friend about it. And I'll attempt to condense a 3 hour conversation into a couple sentences here. He says dont go because in 10 years, will it really matter? Will being her friend or mending this fence matter at all? 

And I didnt have an answer for him. That simple question has thrown my entire view of my life at the moment out of balance. His viewpoint is very nihilistic to me. And I've never encountered this type of situation before.

I wish I had someone to hug to, I'm having constant dreams of having a girlfriend, even though I didn't have any. Everytime I try something new, I find it boring and demotivating. 

My older brother achieved more in life than I ever will. He's earning like a lot of money, and here I am, barely making it to second grade in high school. I've made too many mistakes, and I just can't undo them. How am I supposed to get up? I've had a severe anxiety of future I was like crying every single night, I'm scared of what's gonna happen in the next decade, and if I'll ever fulfill my dreams. Most of them are gone anyway, I just can't stand learning maths. I'm in a advanced level maths and IT class, but I can't move to any other school, because my grades suck. I've tried to find a girlfriend, but the feeling worked only one way, and then I got used by her.

I really would like to achieve my goals one day, but it juts feels like they're impossible to do. 

I only gain fun by playing games, like for real. I'm such a disappointment, failure in life, it's unreal. I can't stand this anymore. I'm not going to kill myself, I don't have the courage nor the will to do it. I'm looking for any tips and advices I could get, that's why I'm mostly writing this. I'm also trying to get a gun license, so I don't think I even can go to a psychiatrist, because they will see it in the records?

Kind regards",03Aug2019,1
85,"2nd day at college, in the canteen.  A girl tells me she knows me and we're from the same town and then starts a conversation, seemed like a really nice person but I was embarrassed to admit I didn't recognize her. Anyway, we talk a little bit and the go our own ways.

A few hours later, I was looking back at today and I realized I don't fucking remember her face so the next time she says hi (if ever) I might have to ask her who she is AGAIN and come off as an egocentric asshole.

Either that, or I take my chances and assume whichever next girl happens to say hi to me is indeed her. Since I have zero ~~female~~ friends , it'll probably work out ?",03Aug2019,1

87,"This is my first post on this sub and I’m also on mobile so bear with me here.

The reason I started doing this is because I was so used to telling her goodnight and telling her about my day before I went to bed that it’s almost impossible for me to sleep otherwise. I would love to text her and say it, but I know that isn’t a good thing to do. So instead I made the journal. It’s mostly just goodnight notes, stuff about my day, how I’m feeling, and drawings I made, all in letter format. I feel like this is much healthier than just outright texting her all this shit, but for some reason I still feel wrong doing it. I feel like it’s creepy or something, I don’t know. I guess my question to you guys is, is this normal? Is this creepy? Am I just overthinking things as usual?",03Aug2019,1

89,"All my life, growing up and going through experiences. I constantly find myself NOT being the center of attention.

Usually if I’m a part of a group or something, I’m the odd one out and people don’t remember my name and eventually forget me. People usually refer to me as “ninja” but I’m not even actively trying to go unnoticed. I’m not even a generic person, at least I’d like to think I’m unique and have distinct physical features.

It’s like I barely have a presence at all. On the bright side, throughout school, work, and sticky situations, I always find a way to evade problematic encounters.

To compare, we all seem to know one guy who really sticks out, is really charismatic, and you might see him in the distance or hear his voice and think, “oh I know that guy.”

Well I’m the complete opposite of that. I would have to do something outlandish or crazy to draw attention.

I wanna know what you guys think, maybe even this post may go unnoticed.",03Aug2019,1
90,"Back story: My old roommate (and ex-friend) was several months behind on her rent. She lived with myself and my boyfriend at the time, now my ex. Turns out my ex was also behind on rent, and I found myself living with two grown adults who were financially irresponsible. I'll give my ex the benefit of the doubt though, he had been let go from his previous job cause the company went under, had to scramble to find work, fell behind, but found a job and was able to pay as soon as he got his first pay. He did in fact follow through on that. However, he's still not in the clear due to frivolous spending.

My roommate is a different story. She was severely behind and we received an eviction warning while she was in South America on some eat, pray, love trip. I approached, at first kindly, and out of concern thinking something was up. I asked close mutual friends, who just shrugged and said that's my roommate ""she's never been good with money"". This blindsided me, cause we lived together for a while and these problems weren't there at first. That's why I thought something was wrong, and offered help. But promises were made no progress was shown. Fast forward to present day, we've all separated our ways. I went through a bad break up, had to move back in with my parents, my boyfriend occupied our old unit. My friend didn't want to live with him, I don't blame her, and moved out. However she failed to find a sublet for her room, yet rather than move back in with her parents, she took up a second rent somewhere else. Why anyone would do that when they don't have the means to even pay for their first place is beyond me. And after raking up even more fees, and with my dad being our co-signor, if this defaulted it affects a lot of people.

I was nice at first. I was sympathetic. Like I said, I even asked if help was needed. It was politely declined, promises weren't fulfilled. But after logging on recently to see that fees were added and with our lease ending on the 31st, I finally stood up for myself and put my foot down. She once again used her excuse of not expecting me and boyfriend to break up and have to pay two rents. But I called her out. Her being behind isn't on my relationship. I can understand if it's awkward when we argued, but I never once brought her into my drama and any argument was had in the privacy of our room. She was behind well before any trouble with my relationship even started. I called her out for traveling out of the country when she didn't have the money. I called her out for only working 20 hours a week and meeting the bare minimum. I called her out on needing to get another job and to blame no one else but herself for this. It felt good, and I know I was in the right because magically, she managed to pay up $1000. I'm disappointed that it had to take all that, but I feel like a weight was lifted, I feel like I can move on from not just my ex but from her as well. I am sad though, because both of them disliked each other to the point where they took it out on me and blamed me. I have people who tell me it's not my fault, nor was that in my control. But I can't help but feel like it is, if my bf and I paid for our own place we wouldn't be in this mess, but rent is too high and while we got on our feet having someone rent our spare room seemed appropriate. But what's done is done. I'm just glad I stood up for myself. I allowed people to take advantage of me financially and as a result I got, got. I learned my lesson, and now I feel like I can close this chapter in my life and move on. In the end, she was not sorry and told me her financial situation was not my business. I didn't respond to that for numerous reasons, but her finances will no longer be my business when she pays up what she owes. She signed a lease, she had one simple job as a roommate, and she failed at that. I rest easier knowing that attest I'm a functioning and responsible adult.

If you've read this far, do yourself a favor and stand up for yourself. I've got a lot of emotions and adrenaline running. But I allowed this person to treat me like a doormat for along time, and in the end when I tried to be nice at first and express how I felt it was dismissed and I was told to stop feeling sorry for myself. If you express your concerns to friends and they dismiss you and get defensive they aren't your friends. But don't let that deter you from speaking your mind or even having to make the choice to call them out and cut them off. Or maybe you don't even need to call them out, just cut them off. Bottomline you owe it to yourself to surround yourself by people who care about you and your wellbeing as much as you do about them. You deserve to be around people who you can trust and you feel secure with. You deserve to be happy and to feel like you can be comfortable with expressing yourself. Thank you for coming to my TedTalk lol

tl;dr: my old roommate and ex friend owed a large amount of rent, took up a second rent at a new place, kept spewing her excuses which were not valid any longer, I didn't want to be a door mat anymore, and I called her out on everything. She got defensive but finally paid up. Case closed.",03Aug2019,27

97,"I feel bad about the way I look, because of it I don't try my chances in dating thinking no girl would want me anyways. I'm a 19 years old guy, been lifting for almost 9 months now although I'm not happy with the progress, I will get there but I haven't reached my goal body yet. I don't find my face attractive, most people say it's average at best, it's very rare when someone says it's ""cute"" or something. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I am not attractive, but how much does that really matter? It definitly affects my self esteem, but I try to focus on the good things about me, I am funny, smart, have a good taste in music, is what people say, I have hobbies, and I have my goals and passion in life. How much does that really matter to find a partner? Would anyone even consider you as an option if you're not physically attractive in the first place? 

&amp;#x200B;

Social skills can be improved, appearance too to a degree. But genes can't be changed, for example having an unnatractive face, getting acne so easily even tho you have good hygiene, or you height (I am only 5'6 btw). If someone asked me I'd tell him just OWN IT, the answer is so easy isn't it? But it's so hard when people treat you differently because of it, they see you as you appear on the outside and not for who you really are and it's very annoying. ""Well just don't give a fuck what people think of you"", also so easy to say and much harder to apply, I don't know how you can truly achieve it. 

&amp;#x200B;

All I want is for my personality to be the only deciding factor, I just don't want my appearance to decide if someone would give me a chance. And it is affecting my life so much that I can't meet people for the first time because I don't want them to have a bad impression about me, like friends I met online. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is it even the appearance? Is it only the attitude? No one can deny how much appearance matters when it comes to dating. I'm just not sure, I really hate the way I look and I wish I can change it so that I wouldn't be so afraid and misjudged all the time. Also I probably have BDD but it doesn't really matter because I'm surely not attractive, not only from my perspective. I would tell people ""Don't worry about it, one day you will someone who likes you for who you are"", but I have a hard time believing that statement myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I feel bad about the way I look because I think it's a deciding factor in many situations especially dating. It makes me afraid to take any chances to approach her because in my mind she rejected me already for my appearance.",03Aug2019,3
98,"I went out yesterday. my goal was to drink one drink only, and to not be so sad that I cried. I still did. twice. once, before going to the clubs, I would be sitting in a recluse area of a restaurant and sob heavily. I was in a fancy bar for a while. I had to, on several occasions, lift my head so as to not start crying. like balancing a glass of water. then later, when I decided one o'clock was late enough this time, I went home. as I was walking to the car, after repeated tries of not crying again, I gave in. It was tough. stomache-churning. loneliness from not having had sex for three years.  or memories of old parent who aren't even dead yet but I still miss. or me being 28, fairy handsome, but a stump socially inept like a retarded turtle.

I am a bit more prepared this time, in that I am more well rested and didn't exercise. I am going out earlier, and plan to initiate contact with a few people. but for obvious reasons, I can't set my goals very high.

100,"The system of democracy here in the United States is working.   I hear a sentiment that it’s been broken somehow, but I think that’s an inaccurate and problematic assertion.

The system was not designed with 2019 in mind.   The founding fathers could never have imagined a world as connected as the one we have.   The modern field of psychology didn’t exist even.

I think the biggest influence on modern democracy has been the field of public relations.   The integration of psychology and psychoanalysis into the world of the media, coupled with the ultimate pervasive nature of modern media.

Edward Bernays ushered in a transformation, a massive social one, that has had immeasurable influence over how people relate to themselves, their lives, their identities, and the world around them.

The media or “free press” is a tool for informing the public, but that comes very secondary to the mechanics of social control.   

Our system of democracy works, but we aren’t accounting for the profound and pervasive nature of the media and how much this influences large masses of people.   Our politicians and corporations have total control of a massive system that goes beyond informing.   It’s reality building.   People are plugged into a machine that forms their social identity and provides them with these pretenses of ideology that is used to steer behaviors.    We are bickering in the perpetual right vs left battle, while our government and military are used to do unspeakable acts around the world.   The media is used to garner consent and support with false information, fear, outright lies, and we are constantly misdirected inward instead of upward.

Right now, the world can marvel at the power the media has by looking at the USA.  We have a criminal administration, run by a scam artist from a reality TV show that sold a false narrative that this person was a self made billionaire.   The producers had to remodel his trump tower suite to false create the impression he actually had a business, and it was a joke to them.   But what was comical entertainment actually burned into the minds of many.   People just can’t see reality here, as we have so many defense mechanisms to protect us from the intrusion truth presents to the whole world we were raised to believe we live with.

We beat our public with the notion our very freedom is actually a debt!   We owe undying loyalty to our military for the freedom we experience here.   I think we had to slowly ramp up that drum beat since Vietnam, as to make sure we had enough of a grip on the minds of our citizens before we could create any more unjust war.   Here, we now celebrate Martin Luther King jr, but that’s after his death.   

My freedom has nothing to do with the ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, two wars that have cost millions of lives.   We actually promoted the war with Iraq and it was dubbed “operation Iraqi freedom” here in the United States.   When it became clear there was no real threat of WMDs, the seemed to make the narrative about our obligations to promote “freedom” around the world.   There would be stories about oppressed women in Iraq, and they tried to show Iraqis celebrating our invasions.   They put the bombings on TV like entertainment.   The “shock and awe”.    They discussed the “laser guided” and precise nature of these bombs to suggest minimal civilian casualties.   It was all fake.   The underlying motives for the war were hidden, and the whole justification for both were just PR fabrications.   For the last 20 years, it’s just been a job of maintaining a dehumanizing view of Muslims to keep our public totally disconnected from the reality of the devastation on a human level.

We talk about “interference” with our elections.   Wonder what someone in Iraq says about the USA and their presidential election post Saddam?   

It’s not about democracy being broken, but rather, the unaccounted for impact of PR and Propaganda on any public.   Decades of force feeding narratives, bigotry, and inaccuracies that become the basis for their relationship to reality itself.   Whole groups of people who aren’t the authors of their own thoughts and arguments, fighting each other within a game of “pin the blame on the scapegoat”.    

At some point we need to wake up and recognize that we have not really articulated the insidious nature of the machine that runs 24/7, competing for our minds, attempting to steer our behavior.   Be it at the voting booth, or the shopping mall.   

Edward Bernay’s introduced “public relations” to the world, a field of study based on his relative Freud’s work, and it transformed the way government and corporations communicate through the public.   It’s taken our “free press”, and turned it into a continuation of the machine itself.   

We don’t need to wonder why we are divided here.   We are divided because we are exposed to two competing streams of messaging.   Right and left.   They would have you think they are simply supplying a market, while in fact, they are creating the market.   Raising and cultivating the market.   Herding it.   We are free thinkers, but that freedom seems to occur within the limitations of the occurrence of self we have all developed into within this pressure cooker of information.    

It’s not democracy or the system that’s broken.   We could change it any way we see fit, but if we didn’t account for what’s at the source, what’s really driving people, what’s really influencing them, the system of government would not make any difference to a population that has surrendered its collective mind to that system.   The power has been taken.   Without knowing how, how could any population ever get it back?",03Aug2019,2

Back in March my fiance left me for another man and threw me on the streets. I was homeless for about 3 weeks living in my car at the back of my shop at work. I blew through my savings to try to get in a place to take out multiple payday loans (which I know was a terrible idea) and I still haven't been able to pay any of them off or catch up. My job is decent but I only make $12 an hour. I finally found a place and was able to stabilize enough to just stay afloat u til this month.  My job is weather based and I've had to miss 16 days of work this past month because of rain.  I work for a small employer and there is no paid time off. I have fallen so far behind with the loans coming out of my check automatically. Rent was due 2 days ago and I got paid Friday but my check was $92 and now I'm sitting at about $8 to my name. $592 short.  I live with a roommate who took me in and they had to front the rent and are hurting themselves now.  I've tried looking for gigs and side jobs on Craigslist selling off some of my old stuff that I have but I really don't have anything to my name.  I have no friends or family here in Florida to help me. 

I suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder and am not able to  get help because I have no money, poor credit, and no insurance. I can feel myself slipping into another very depressive episode. On top of all that I had a severely infected tooth that has worked it's way into infecting my jaw I am in constant miserable pain.  I've had 3 open heart surgeries and my risk for infection of my heart is astronomically higher than normal people. I don't even care. At this point. I would never kill myself but atm I'm welcoming death.  Last week I had kidney stones for the 2nd time and had to bear through the pain until it passed. All of this happening at once has completely and utterly destroyed me, and I am so numb I don't care what happens to me. I'm so sick of the cyclical bullshit that happens and even though I do my absolute best to work hard and stay positive I can't seem to ever get ahead, or save money for a rainy day. I'm over it.

107,"Hello reddit. I am 24 M, the location is Eastern Europe.

Sorry for my bad english, i did not study it

I'll start from the beginning

I was born in a small village in the most ordinary family of hard workers. Father constantly disappeared at work, mother was at home, doing housework. I can’t say that I had a perfect childhood - I had to work hard, and I could only dream of a trip to the sea or at least to some kind of amusement park.

I practically did not communicate with my father all my life, starting from childhood - he was almost all the time at work, and ending today - we were never at least somehow close. Fortunately, we had a warm relationship with my mother at least at that far time.

I don’t know why, but since childhood I was very closed to myself. I did not communicate with classmates and neighboring children, spending free time with books, which is why I came across as strange

More, in general, I did not stand out. I studied normal at school - i could, of course, study well and even excellently, but either my parents didn’t tell me why this was necessary, or I didn’t understand it myself - it's hard to say.

When I was 7 years old, I was hit by a car. Right next to the school on a break, we ran to a store nearby. The drunk driver was faster than me. Torn ligaments on the leg, concussion, cracked ribs and many minor bruises. About a month I spent at first in the hospital, then at home, and when I returned to school I became even more clear of people

Several years passed without any special incidents, until at 13 my parents decided to send me to the sanatorium for a month - after the car hit me, my health constantly left much to be desired. I was often and hard sick, so my parents decided that a month there would be useful for me

And it was just a nightmare. Imagine that you are an absolute introvert who, like a snail, was pulled out of a shell and thrown somewhere. It was a terrible month. Once in a company of 20 completely strangers, I finally shut myself down. But if everyone in the native village got used to it, then there it resulted in insults and humiliations, to which I could not oppose anything.

When I returned home, my parents noticed that something was wrong with me, but I just could not tell them what was happening, answering their questions “everything is fine” This answer, of course, did not satisfy them. So they decided to send me for further training at the Lyceum, which was located in the regional center.

At first, everything was not so bad, but over time the story from the sanatorium repeated. I was the very person with whom everyone laughed, who was bullied. Regular beatings, humiliations. I don’t know for what reason I could not admit to anyone about it, but it lasted a year and a half. It ended up just swallowing pills. But since I’m writing all this, you can understand that i was saved

After that, my parents took me back to the village and simply sent me to another school. Further, surprisingly, it was better. After about half a year, I somehow found a common language with classmates. In the last year of school, I even started dating a girl, which lifted me morally to unprecedented heights, it seemed that everything was starting to get better.

After leaving school, she and I went to study in the same city (and I even managed to enter a budget place), so we spent a lot of time together. With sadness and warmth I remember that time, the best time in my life. But, it lasted three years, and then she became pregnant. It makes no sense to explain that two students with minimal work would not have mastered creating a family with a child, so I decided to take an academic leave at the university and go to a construction to make money.

A few months of work, a little rest, a few more months of work. As a result, I earned enough money so that we could not need anything for some time. Having returned home, I rented an apartment in the same city and started looking for work, and we agreed with the girl that she would stay with her mother this time, and after giving birth we would start living together

In general, everything went wrong. I got a job, she stayed with her mother. Then she gave birth to a son. It is difficult to describe my condition at that moment. On the one hand, I realized that I was only 21 years old, and this is too early. On the other hand, I knew that we could handle it and everything would be fine but no. After giving birth, she refused to go to me, arguing that she was too hard. Despite the fact that I then worked 6 days a week, there was still time after work in any case to help her in everything. I hinted at it, but was not heard.

She asked me to give her another week until she bounced back. Then another week. Then again. I came to them on their only day off, and on the same day I returned to the city, because I had to work. In the end, I was sent to fuck out. Seriously. I still remember her words ""You are not interested in making it easier for me, you don’t understand that if I move, it will be very difficult for me while you are at work, and here my mother helps me. You are not a man because you don’t think about me.""

Uhh damn 

This is still the most fucked up event in my life, the most unexpected, incomprehensible, unjustified. After that, I broke off all contacts and spent about half a year in the company of beer and a computer, as well as occasionally the only friend who visited me and jokingly asked if I would kill myself 

In the end, I tried to make contact with my ex. Not for the sake of a relationship, for the sake of a son. He was sent both by her and her mother, and even her sister, whose husband promised to beat me if I do not calm down.

Then everything went awry. I recovered at the university, but I could not continue my studies because of laziness (or is it procrastination? It doesn’t matter) - I was expelled after half a year. I changed a dozen works - I didn’t stay anywhere longer than a couple of months, it all ended up with me just quitting, living on the remaining money for a while, looking for a new job - repeat, repeat, repeat After a while, everyone who tried to support me - and it was my parents and friend - waved a hand at me, wrote off. No hobbies, no loved ones, no purpose in life, nothing. And I myself am nothing and nobody.

It is strange to realize how during all these events I constantly lied to everyone. I lied to my relatives that I would pack up and get out of this hole. I lied to the few people with whom I talked that this was the last time, and then I would pull myself together and cope, get out of this hole. Lied to myself about the same. But did nothing.

And all this time I imagined what would have happened if I had done something. Seriously, I imagined that I had not parted with the former, that everything was fine with us. That I graduated, found a normal job, became a normal person. He built in his head the scripts “what if I did ...” There was some way out in this, after such thoughts I felt better. Although the last 4 years have been extremely terrible in every sense.

I'm just tired of this existence. Yesterday I was left without housing, there was money left for a few days, when they end - I will leave this place

It is surprising that only after I made this decision for myself I feel pacified

108,"Recently I've been wanting to write someone close to me for a long time. We fell out of touch 2 years ago when I moved to college. I just printed off the letter and then I had a feeling like I had seen myself putting it on the desk next to the envelop, in a dream. The moments before I was thinking long and hard about whether I should do it or not. I was on the part of the Pros of sending the letter out. There has almost been signs of fate around the letters. I was watching TV in the break room when I snapped into a daydream. Suddenly, they popped on TV in a commercial. I seen a news article on the same day I printed the letter off, where they talked about their goals in the upcoming years, and hinted, not even obviously towards what they wanted me to help them with.

The purpose of the letter is to try and reach out and help them with something they told me they always wanted. I feel as if I can help a lot with my knowledge to what they are trying to accomplish. I have always been dedicated to thinking about it and that is what we bonded on. I think about it in the shower, before I sleep and while I'm eating. Sometimes in the shower, I just sit there accidentally for 45 minutes just thinking.. They say they do the EXACT same thing.

Which brings me back to my question, do you believe that with signs like this, it was kinda meant to be? I feel like there are a lot more coincidences sounding this that I'm not even sharing. It takes a lot to freak me out and I don't believe in signs from god or anything, but this is freaking me out a little bit. What do you guys think?",03Aug2019,0

I’ve been into muscular girls for a long time and I love to see this. Since I was a little kid I’ve liked them, and my mom is also very muscular. I like to see her flex her muscles too. I once caught her flexing her pecs in the mirror and  I just couldn’t stop watching. She knows that I like muscular girls because I got her into bodybuilding. She was a normal woman and was pretty young when she started, she was about 28 when she started and I was around 10 years old. She caught me watching videos on muscular girls when I was little (browser history). So she asked me what if I start training like that, and I was surprised but also happy to have a muscular woman in the family. So she started training, and has been training for about 8 years now. She’s gotten pretty muscular and her muscles just pop out. Now she always walks around the house in her bra and panties. And I just stare at her pecs and muscles, and I love to see her flex her pecs.",03Aug2019,0
116,"I am the uncle of two nieces, and they are two wonderful, smart girls who I grew up together - that's right, the one I'm talking about is only a year younger than me. Well, we used to do funny stuff all the time growing up - we used to talk about anything and everything, she was sort of like a best friend to me. Then, (I am 23 now, she is 22), when she was about 18 years old, she had a high fever and then some sort of chronic illness in her legs developed. It causes her not being able to walk without the help of another person or walking crutches. It was terrible when this happened. My sister and her husband was very secretive towards us when she developed this illness. They didn't tell us anything. I don't even know what the illness is called like (if someone has an idea I would appreciate it) but they never wanted to tell us. Well I am still in good contact with all of them but it's like they completely ignore this problem. They went to doctors etc, but the illness persists, she now cannot walk without assistance or crutches, and right next to being something terrible to happen to you when you are at your best age, it has caused terrible issues with her self esteem.

She did not pass college entrance exams and basically hangs around in her home all day doing nothing. The last 3 years she has done absolutely nothing. Just being in her room. She is basically wasting her life away. She could go pursue an education, learn a job, make friends, go swimming etc - with some assistance everything would be possible, I mean if people in a wheel chair can do it, then why can't she? But she doesn't want to do anything. She has 0 self-esteem, she is feels to ashamed to even go outside and be seen like this.

My sister and her husband apparently have given up on her. Everytime when I talk to them about that, suggesting some solution etc, they tell me that they tried already, that there is nothing they can do and that she needs to do it herself. But what if she can't? I know what it feels like to be on rock bottom. Not being able to even take a walk outside of your house because of mental issues, insecurities, anxieties, depression etc. What if she can't help herself? Will she be at home and rot away until she's 30 and then kill herself because of the regret of having wasting away her best years???? 

She needs to take up responsibilty, learn to handle her disabily, go pursue an education or a job, take on hobbies and continue seeing her old friends (that would love to hang out with her!) but she just doesn't can or want to. So what do I do?

How can I help her/my sister? I don't want to see how my niece wastes away her whole life and then regrets it in the end.",03Aug2019,3

119,"In 2018 I proposed to my girlfriend of nearly four years. This was the most significant relationship either of us had been in. Not to mention a massive milestone in our lives. We broke the engagement news to our family and friends. Blessing, positive wishes, and immense excitement came flooding in.

Soon after we began planning a beautiful wedding in a nearby arboretum. From the outside, our relationship must have seemed perfect. **But inside the relationship, we were a mess.**

The more we planned our wedding the more we stressed. **We were struggling. And we had been struggling for a long time.**

My fiance said she felt trapped. She became disconnected and believed that she was misunderstood. Despite planning a wedding with me, her future husband, she felt completely alone.

I, however, felt I knew all the answers. If she would just do “X”, “Y”, or “Z”, everything would be better. I didn’t know it at the time, but I was casting judgment on her. And doing so quite frequently.

**She felt alone and I felt I couldn’t trust her to pull her weight.**

A literal recipe for disaster.

Over the next few months, we continued to grow apart. We would rarely discuss our relationship. I think both of us tried to ignore the obvious red flags surrounding us. If we just ignore the problems they don’t exist right? Wrong.

Things got really bad. We had hit a boiling point and I wanted to end the relationship.

I felt justified too. I was unable to trust her with even basic tasks. She seemed complacent and unwilling to grow with me. We both wanted to homeschool our children and that scared the shit out of me at this point.

**If I can’t trust her with the dishes how can I really trust her with our child’s education?**

One night we had a fight and I told her how I felt. She knew things were bad, but kept hoping we would work it out. Emotionally destroyed, she packed up whatever she could carry and left the house.

A four-year relationship, engagement, and wedding all over in the blink of an eye.

Over the next few days, we exchanged a few texts back and forth. We were trying desperately to work through whatever we could at this point.

Given how abruptly it all ended we agreed to have another discussion, but she wanted a few days to gather her thoughts.

When met again she had a gigantic list of notes. In our time apart she was researching trust, fear, and vulnerability. During a multi-hour discussion, we examined each of these concerns and their effects on our relationship.

**What had really happened? What caused the cracks in the wall before it crumbled?**

One thing shocked me more than anything else we talked about. **She didn’t trust herself.** There was an internal dialogue in her mind. She knew she wouldn't follow through, so it was pointless to start something new.

**And for the first time in our relationship, I felt that I truly began to understand her at a deeper level.**

We agreed to keep the relationship alive, but with a few strict rules.

1. **Research.** We would read and discuss a variety of popular relationship books
2. **Communication.** We would take notes individually and meet each week to discuss the reading
3. **Judgment Free.** We agreed to create an open environment where any concerns could be addressed

I didn’t know it at the time, but this commitment to communication would save our relationship.

It would bring us closer together than ever before. It would make us happier and more understood than we had ever felt before.

**And it would make me realize how much I still needed to grow. You see I wasn’t nearly as “right” as I thought I was. Most of the time I wasn’t “fixing” shit in our relationship. I was making it worse, but my ego blinded me.**

This is our story. The challenges we have overcome and continue to tackle. I am proud to say that we are still together despite it all.

**Relationships are hard. People so often feel misunderstood and disconnected. Often we are not on the ""same page.""**

In this post, we have worked together to distill the information we believe saved our relationship and future marriage. We share this with you in the hope that it helps you when the chips are down and your back is to the wall.

# Sharing goals changed our relationship

People talk about “communication” as the key to a relationship, but what does it actually mean? It’s such a nebulous and vague term. We believe that that we failed to communicate about deep issues.

Our greatest fears, wildest dreams, and specific goals. These are the elements we were missing. As we began to work on our relationship I spotted a few insights that proved were we on the right track.

1. **We enjoyed the intentional time we spent together.** This time together was ours alone. It allowed us to be focused together, improve our skills, and dive deeper into challenges that need additional attention. We both began to look forward to this time. It made us feel connected.
2. **I was not as right as I once thought.** I was a shitty listener and spent most of the time frustrating her with solutions she already knew. You see, I am a fixer. It’s my greatest career asset and my biggest relationship hurdle to overcome. The more I tried to “fix” the less she wanted to open up to me.
3. **She became comfortable discussing deep emotional issues.** In the past, she often felt I was being aggressive and confrontational in our discussions. These emotions made me remind her of negative memories with her father. He had unknowingly caused a great deal of emotional pain when she was a child. Once we understood what was happening we worked together to create a safer environment for her to share vulnerable thoughts.
4. **The more we worked together, the happier she became.** She helped more around the house with small chores (something I routinely complained about before). She took better care of herself with hygiene and nutrition. She spent more time achieving her personal goals. And now she’s admitted to being happier now than she has ever been before.
5. **We felt more like a team.** We became stronger together and in time that missing trust was rebuilt. It was hard and took a lot of time, but we did it. Little things still bother us, sure. But they are always addressed before they can be bottled up and devastate the relationship later.
6. **We had more fun and celebrated together.** Before working on our relationship we would never plan date nights or go out on a whim. We preferred a binge night of Netflix because it was easy. Now we go out all the time. We indulge in fancy meals without guilt or worry about our budget. These times together are about us and we believe they should be celebrated that way.

# Learn from our mistakes

Despite overcoming our hardships neither of us feels that we are unique or special. We know that other people are struggling to stay on the same page with their partner. It’s a constant battle that everyone battles against.

So, we feel it is our obligation to take what we have learned and to share it with you. Below are the specific steps we took to save our relationship. Use them to help yours:

## Set a time to talk and be intentional

You’re already super busy, so be intentional with your time. Pick a date, mark it on the calendar, and set a notification on your phone. Whatever it takes to get you both in the same room at the same time.

## One of you be more enthusiastic

Often this is the woman. But no matter who it is, understand the dynamic. If you are the one more invested in these meetings be aware of that. Keep the conversation on track and don’t push your partner farther than they are willing to go. If you push too hard they will get resistant to future discussions.

**I promise they will open up more, but it may take some time. Be patient and always thank them for what they are doing. Even if you wanted more.**

## Pick categories before you meet

Our first meeting was a disaster compared to what we do now. I bought up a bunch of career and self-development concerns. She stayed focused on family, kids, and what our future home would look like. It was chaos.

Before you meet to decide on a few categories together. Deciding on a few categories will keep you focused and help you both articulate your thoughts. Some of the categories that we use are: *Family / Kids, Finance, Experiences, Travel, Personal Goals, Dreams, Careers / Business*

## Always come prepared

Treat these discussions like a high priority meeting with your boss at work. Come prepared with your thoughts written down in detail.

**Take notes, jot down questions and concerns. Anything goes. Just do the prep work.**

Sharing the topics with your partner beforehand can be very helpful as well. If you blindside your partner with a touchy subject you can kiss your productive session goodbye. It will go down the tubes faster than you can even apologize.

A prepared couple also ensures that nothing is left unsaid. When you’re in the moment these discussions can be emotional. It’s easy to forget an important concern you had. What’s more, if you’re prepared you can even practice how you wish to address difficult topics.

## Make it a date

You’re doing important work, so make it as easy as possible to go. Pick a fun place that you both love.

The first few times you do one of these goal-setting meetings it will be hard. Not too mention a little bit awkward. For these reasons, we highly recommend making this a special date night.

**If your partner is the hesitant one then try picking a place they love. This will help them feel more comfortable and enjoy the experience more.**

## Listen with an open mind and heart

These sessions are not for the faint of heart. You’re going to hear some intense feedback and maybe even some downright tough criticism. It can be tough and uncomfortable.

You need to support each other without judgment. Your goal should be to create a safe place where both of your concerns can be heard. The more you two can share the secrets you can uncover.

## Celebrate your victories

For us, I had a terrible habit of always fixing problems. The more I fixed the less open she was with her concerns. Now when she opens up I thank her. And when I listen without fixing she thanks me. By doing this we acknowledge that we are both overcoming our own challenges.

**To change behavior you need to reward the positive and let the negative slide.**

Overcome the hardship with a feeling of success. Build positive momentum and you will make big breakthroughs.

## Take notes and reflect

After our first discussion, I felt like a college student who walked into the wrong class and took a final exam I knew nothing about. You know, you study all night for a physics exam only to find out the class is actually about the history of roman art… It didn’t go well.

I had no idea what I was doing. So I took a shitload of notes. These notes helped me reflect on our conversation afterward. Without the notes, I would have been left high and dry.

**How you take the notes does not matter. Just take the notes. You’ll thank yourself later.**

If you want to go further reflect and ask yourself some questions:

* How did the meeting go?
* Did I feel my concerns were heard?
* What should I work on for my partner?
* How can I make the next one better?

## Schedule the next meeting

Your life is going to get busy. Doesn’t it always? I guarantee crap is going to get in your way.

We know that life will get in the way so it’s best to plan your next meeting during your first meeting. **Don’t wait and put it off. You have the energy now so knock it out.**

If you wait till later something will come up. A random project from work. Your car needs to go to the shop. Your kid has a soccer game that night.

To overcome the scheduling conflict we made our meetings recurring. In the beginning, we met every week to rebuild our relationship. We were in a tough place and the constant contact helped lift us out of a dark hole.

If you’re in better shape try a monthly approach. **I would not recommend anything less frequent than that. Quarterly and yearly discussions are helpful but too infrequent from our experience to provide enough value.**

These meetings are one of the most important things you can do in your relationship. Always make it easier to show up!

# Our final thoughts

Almost two years later we still intentionally meet each month to discuss our individual and relationship goals. Our relationship is as good as it’s ever been and we’re never going to stop these discussions.

So, if you’re struggling in your relationship or just want to stay better connected then try some of our strategies.

Time goes by so quickly. **Years can pass in the blink of an eye and one day you may wake up to a partner you barely recognize**.

Don’t wait until it’s too late.

These tactics have worked for us and I’m confident they can work for you too.

124,"Since I was little I was a rascal and climbing anything and everything, would often get on the highest part of my house I could. I found myself just sitting up there on the roof gazing out into the tree tops and other buildings just at peace, noticing the clouds trees and birds being with nature with not and not a worry in the world. I was aware of everything that had happened, is most likely to happen and is happening to me. I'm aware I'm in this hypnotic state and I liked it. 

Recently I was in class and my left arm had swollen up, it had been since the night before but I made nothing of it but while in class as if bee's had been stinging the inside of my arm a pain got me doing nothing in class, nothing productive anyway. I left early and came home went to see my family physician he said I might have a nerve pinch some where in my arm recommended I see a neurologist. Went for that appointment and he noticed my arm was noticeably smaller than the other did some tests and we found out I had severe nerve damage and muscle detoriation. He gave me some meds, is getting me to do physiotherapy, and constant massages (which admittedly the last one I didn't mind). 

On my way home in a tuk it struck me that if my muscles in my arm were dying that I might lose my arm and hand, I called the neurologist and uneasily he confirmed it. After that while I was on my way home that feeling of awareness struck me. Lofi in my headset, my vape in my hand I was at peace with everything (somehow). I was okay with losing my arm which freaked out everyone I told when I said i might lose my arm with not a care in the world. I'm still not sure why I'm okay with it but I don't mind it.

127,"Recently I’ve been thinking about high school and where I was mentally then. I tried to kill my self more than I care to admit because I thought that there’s no way in hell my life will ever be looking up. 

But here I am. 6 years later, the happiest I’ve ever been. I have the most incredible man to love me and care for me and I never thought I’d get someone as truly incredible as him. I had searched out abusive and manipulative relationships in the past because that’s what I thought I deserved. (PRO TIP: NO ONE DESERVES THAT. YOU DESERVE THE WHOLE WORLD AND DON’T LET ANYONE TELL YOU OTHERWISE). 

I’m changing jobs because I’ve realized that I need more for me than just great people to work with. Back to the boy, he’s so supportive of me. He always gives me his honest opinion, even when he knows I won’t like it, but he has been my number one cheerleader for the two and a half years we have been together and shit, I hope I get lucky enough to marry him. BUT! I’m really nervous about this change. I’m going to a decently large company, changing career paths completely and I’m nervous, but I think it will be good. It has a lot to offer me and my future.

I’m going to school full time come the fall semester and I’m nervous as hell to do full time work and full time school but I think I’ll be okay. I think I’m smarter than I let myself believe. Is that cocky? I don’t know. I waited a long time to go to school. I blame it a lot on not being able to afford loans but I think part of it was not succeeding. So far so good though. I think I’ll be okay.

I live in a great home and have so many people in my life that love and support me. It really gets to me sometimes that my support system is literally my aunt and my boyfriends whole family. But I am so lucky to have people like them. I love them as much as they love me. I am truly grateful for them. 

I have the best dog, who is sometimes not the best dog, but he is just the best, even when he’s not.

I am so thankful and grateful that I didn’t die all those years ago. While there are definitely still emotional rough patches, my life still looks up.

Because honestly:  


1-Apparently it's punishable by Death/ridicule/Cyber-bulling(/s)  


2-Japan may have a lot of awesome things...But in some,if not A LOT of areas,it needs some serious work(and personally,I hate the Japanese PM,Abe just as much as I hate trump right now)  


3-You may or may not get into a bunch of shit if you are a minority(idk about if you're LGBT...but then again,it seems like the damned world has a problem with minorities/LGBT/women.)  


4-Anime,Manga,all awesome,no doubt...But Japan is NOT some sort of Anime Utopia(although Japanese women are among the best of the best in looks as far as I'm concerned.)  


5-There are quite a few bitches(I hate using that word,honestly) and assholes in Japan too...Just like anywhere else in the world.  


6-Unlike Germany,Japan seems to have this ""We did nothing wrong"" mentality when it comes to WWII and that has a very high chance of coming back to bite Japan in the ass eventually...  


7-...Which brings me to my next point:At the rate Japan's going:I'd wager a decent sum of money that Japan WILL get nuked again in the future/near future(and US along with them,because allies) by either China and/or North Korea(but I'm betting the most on North Korea,There is NO ONE on this earth that hates Japanese more than Koreans..I bet you that they Hate Japan just as much as the Palestinians/Arabs hate Israel -\_-)  


8-Japan's a beautiful place...but it's liable/prone to get hit by hurricanes(Typhoons),Earthquakes/tsunamis(3/11)...and has it's share of crazy,twisted motherfuckers(the KyoAni incident -\_-)  


9-The Government fucking sucks,the Japanese government is just as worse as the GOP here in the states and did I mention that the head honchos(Abe and the fuckheads) are world-class assholes? yeah.  


10-And also,did I mention that it has problems with it's neighbors(ESPECIALLY AND NAMELY Korea,BOTH of them)?  


Conclusion/TL;DR:Japan is amazing,but you must exercise some logic/realism/common sense when it comes to the place;  
Japan is a country filled with regular people and has it's share of problems,some of them massive. And people,don't like weeaboos,and although that word doesn't mean anything to me personally,I have found that it doesn't pay to be a weeb at all.

Since then I’ve just scrolled and found a lot of similar stories and situations. I’ve given advice on situations that hit close to home, and in turn actually wound up talking to myself, if that makes sense.

It was a situation that in the grand scheme of things is small, but in my life, at this time, it was one of many that reiterated what I already new. 
A lightbulb went on that said “what the fuck are you doing here?!” 

Anyways, I guess what I’m saying is thank you to the reddit community. The strangers that made me speak to myself in a way that I would listen.",03Aug2019,6
134,"I am a 15 year old male and I used to be against relationships in my age group. I've turned down many opportunities to get in relationships at my age because it seemed so counterintuitive to me, because seldomly do people know who they are yet. I finally caved into this one girl who seemed mature enough and she was really sweet. Within two weeks, she came forth and said I was a rebound and wanted nothing to do with me. For a month or so, I lost my sense of optimism and I hated every day of it. I was suprised at how much I learned about ""relationships"" and myself. I ended up falling for another friend of mine. This friend was really great, and I knew they really cared about me and my wellbeing. Lo and behold,  I was left within two weeks because she wanted to be with her ex. She said I was the much better option, but her heart wants what it wants. With all this being said, I've come to the conclusion that I'm not all that cut out for relationships at this point in time. I'm pretty fine with that, especially if it means that I won't feel so sorrowful again.",03Aug2019,6
