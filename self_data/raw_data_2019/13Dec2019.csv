1,"Last year, I had many frustrated people come into my office because someone made a webcomic and coined a concept called emotional Labor. It still haunts me to this day. It is incredibly frustrating because it is a concept devoid of context. While I understand the sentiment, the point is that, in a relationship, you have to be explicit with your wants and needs. Emotional Labor is literally a concept that describes the frustration of the problematic part of being in a relationship, “The Work.” I blame Disney movies for conditioning an entire millennial generation, of which I am a part so save your “OK Boomer” to believe that relationships don’t take work. We all secretly believe that one day, we will be walking down the proverbial street and minding our own business when suddenly, we will lock eyes with someone and experience emotions we’d only felt watching Love Actually. When we lock eyes with this person, time will slow down, and instantly we will know that we have found the one. You will both say “hi” at the exact same time, and it will be a scene out of a movie. The problem is that many relationships do indeed start off in that manner. “Walking down the street” is a metaphor for “minding my own damn business and then suddenly the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my life communicates to me non-verbally that they want to be in my life”.

You cannot form a healthy relationship that functions primarily on non-verbal cues anymore (humans did that before verbal and written language). You have to translate those messages from non-verbal into verbal communication.

99% of all relationship problems are due to one simple negative belief.

That belief is that we can know what each other means when they say things.

The reason we can’t is because of the translation of non-verbal into verbal communication and vice versa. This is the Emotional Labor that people speak of so much, and it is fucking hard.

You see, there are things in relationships that I like to call “Emotional Gates”. Emotional gates are a concept that I totally came up with all on my own and definitely don’t owe credit to anyone. Emotional gates are milestones in relationships that indicate that the people within the relationship see a future with each other in it.

Emotional gates include things like moving in together, meeting each other’s parents, or meeting each other’s friends.

The problem is that sometimes, in relationships, there are emotional gatekeepers. These people gatekeep the movement in relationships by bringing up these issues not as an actual conversation, but as a way to ask their partner, “do you see a future with me in it?”.

Now, why would someone ask that question?

Again, Disney moves have conditioned us to believe that our relationships will “progress naturally” without us ever having to talk about it and they do. Still, at some point, if you don’t ever talk about that progression, you will come to situations in your relationship where you will have questions about what things mean.

That is why emotional Labor is a dangerous concept.

For example, let’s say that you move in with your partner, and you notice that they start “leaving their pants on the floor.” Now in this specific example, I am saying “leaving their pants on the floor”, but it can be “any behavior that I don't like and that continues to happen even though I ask them to stop”

What does it mean that my partner left his pants on the floor? I know that I have asked him not to do that, and I know that he continues to do that. I am tired of asking him not to do this: what does this mean?

Instead of that, partners, women especially, have been told that this is an example of you experiencing “emotional labor”, and the concept is so all-encompassing that you never think to ask those questions.

What you are experiencing is that you have reached an emotional gate sooner than your partner. You are saying that you want to go through that gate together, and your partner, by their behavior, seems to be indicating that they don’t.

You have to talk about this.

Ugh…I’m tired of trying to extend this metaphor. There is no such thing as emotional Labor. Relationships take work. Yeah, I know you think “he should already know,” well, he doesn’t. He keeps showing you that he doesn’t. So “nagging” isn’t working. You are going to have to train/teach him and to train/teach; you must offer more than just consequences. Yes, that means you have to praise him when he does well. “Well no one praises me!”. I get it. And that sucks, but that’s because he sees you as perfect. Remember, he has you on a pedestal. So he believes that everything you say is the truth and will only question that truth in the most passive-aggressive of ways like “forgetting to do something” and seeing if you get mad at it. If you get crazy, then he feels justified in “forgetting.” It is all very confusing, but the simple truth is that you have to tell your man what to do and tell your man what you want.

If you want more “help around the house”, then say “Husband/Partner/Friend, I really appreciate everything that you do for me. The amount of support that you give on things that I probably don’t even know about is amazing, and for this, I say thank you. \*kiss on the cheek, stroke hair\*. I know we have both been swamped, who has been the busiest it matters not, and I have noticed that that sometimes I do more stuff around the house before you have a chance to see it. I also get mad at you because you don’t “help out around the house”. I was upset about this until I realized it wasn’t fair to you that I do everything before you get a chance. So would you please wash the dishes before I get up in the morning? The reason being that it is awesome to me to see a clean kitchen and also, it just reminds me of my big strong man. \*winky face\*.”

Is that “emotionally laborious”? Hell yes, it was laborious for me to write. This must be what having a baby is like. (That one is going to get me into so much trouble). I just said it so that when someone takes it out of context, it will inspire outrage, and people love circulating outrageous things. Like one time, I read about this dumb concept called Emotional Labor.

Emotional Labor is necessary for a relationship to work. You have to talk about it and yes, even that, is emotionally laborious, and if you want to leave your partner because you are tired of talking, then ok, but don’t say it is because “You did everything you could”.",13Dec2019,1
2,"First thing's first, I only joined this subreddit because a certain youtuber I watched was producing alot of blandcontent lately. I figured these guys were in the same page as me so I joined, made a few jokes and so forth. One other thing I should note is these joke posts I made, I created before I realized how terrible and toxic the subreddit was and decided to leave it.

To prevent them from coming over here, I will not state what the subreddit is, but basically I've been labeled a hypocrite by them just because i stated what I think about their subreddit in a similar subreddit. A user in the cousin subreddit of the one I left made a post talking about to not care about the content. And I saw a number of people talking about THAT subreddit that I just left and decided to state my thoughts about it and the toxic activities they do on a daily basis. The thing I said is basically what their whole subreddit revolves around. The truth. I spoke my mind about the current state of that place and labeled it as nothing but shaming and memes. Apparently one of the members saw it and screencapped what I said, the said joke post I posted there several weeks ago, and decides to call me a hypocrite over it. And basically everyone over there hates me now.

I would say I don't care, but considering I'm making a rant post about it, I guess I kinda care, but maybe its because I want to preserve my public image or whatever.  Why that even matters to me, I don't know. I never even know how to handle these kind of situations. I wouldn't be so bothered about it if those people would stop tagging me so I can see all the shit talking they're saying about me.  I mean all I did was speak my mind and what I think about that whole subreddit. And those posts they're using that they're using against me were made before I realized how much of a large toxic shithole that place is.

As of now, I'm still waiting for the mods over there to ban me or whatever. But if anything, nothing from them will happen and i'll just continue being a laughing stock with the hypocrite label.",13Dec2019,1

My conundrum is such, we have a day the week before christmas where we give our friends gifts and them us and I was trying to figure out which to give him. At first I thought the mini but my brother bought him the controller. So I figured christmas would be better for that. 

My problem with giving the capture card is that it costs significantly more than the gifts I got our friends and I dont want them to think I dont like them. Hes really really wanted that capture card for the last 2 years and I know hell go crazy for it. Idk if I should save it for christmas to be a bigger surprise.

7,"I've only been alive 24 years. Considering that the average life expectancy in the US is around 80, I'm only a little over a quarter of the way done at this point. I'm still YOUNG. So why is it that I've been shoved into the ""adult"" box??? Why do people think they have the right to tell me who I am or am not, and how I should identify? What is the rush with trying to force someone into being an adult? If adulthood were to start at 40 (which, I'm not even necessarily proposing that, as it would conflict far too much with biology and societal convenience), we'd still have a full half of our lives devoted to being grown up, while the previous half was dedicated to being a kid. It would be an even split, which makes way more sense to me than cutting childhood off at 18 and leaving the remaining 62 years of a person's life to be an adult.

I mean, better yet, why not just let people CHOOSE? Maybe there are some who WANT to spend the vast majority of their lives as adults, and that's totally fine too. But then there are people like me who, despite being in college and having a job and doing a lot of activities that people would consider ""adult"" tasks, still think of themselves as kids. I mean, I'm not at all interested in climbing the corporate ladder, dating, starting a family, having kids of my own, drinking, etc. I'd much rather stay home and play with my video games and toys, daydream and write. My emotional needs are still that of a child; I still long to be carried to bed, cuddled, kissed, and told how loved I am by an older, protective friend or something.

But the world DENIES me that just because I've crossed some arbitrary threshold they've drawn in the sand. They consider me used and expendable rather than young, fresh, and full of potential. And like I said...why??? My life isn't even half over yet. And yet people talk like I'm somehow in a totally different category than a teenager. 

It's not. Fucking. Right.",13Dec2019,2
9,"My BF just left for work and I took my puppy out right after and there was this 18-19 year old guy in my backyard. He said he was looking for a green rugby ball he lost last night. There is no way that could have happened. I know all my neighbours and he is not one of them so there is no way his ball ended up in my yard. I told him I'd keep an eye out for it and he went to leave. 

I took my puppy back inside and went to close and lock all my windows and I could see he was still in my driveway and he slowly walked off. He was looking around and made his way down a driveway across the street and about 100 meters down. He was there for about 5 minutes and I could see him looking at my house as he walked away. 

I called my bf and he turned around and saw this kid walking. He stopped and asked him what he was doing and he relayed something similar to what he said to me. My BF is a no bullshit kind of guy and straight up asked him if he was scoping our house out. He obviously said he wasn't and my bf said he had him on camera and knows what he looks like.

The other driveway he went down is a holiday home and my next door neighbor is often away. We went and warned the neighbors that were around and they are contacting the owners of the unoccupied houses to warn them also. 

How does it make sense to be ""looking for a ball"" down two properties not even connected or on the same side of the street. So suspicious.

I've felt so safe here and although there have been break ins in the area, I've never felt like I needed to worry. Now i feel paranoid and anxious, considering my bf works quite late most nights.",13Dec2019,1
10,"Because,when you think about it:  


1-You don't know the person.  


2-You'll NEVER meet/see that person in your ENTIRE life  


3-It's not like their even part of your family! And they're not friends/coworkers,etc.  


4-If they do decide to kill themselves,it's not like you'll be held criminally liable or anything like that.  


5-The world is unbelievably fucked up and the country is RAPIDLY going to utter hell(And it's getting *exponentially worse)*. What the flying fuck is the problem if someone can't deal with it anymore? Why CAN'T they decide to escape in their own way?  


6-**We are ALL going to die anyway,NO exceptions...so,what's the problem if someone wants to speed it up?**  


7-Wouldn't it be better if the bullshit just ended? If you NEVER had to deal with all this bullshit again?  


8-Death,is actually a kind of release.  


9-Depending on certain things(i.e,you're a liberal/LGBT/Minority) people in this country want you dead anyway. Why give them the pleasure of offing you?  


10-In the end,if someone wants to kill themselves,then guess what-THEIR life,THEIR decision,THEIR fate. I can understand if it's a child/teenager that wants to do this,you'd stop them,but what right do you have to tell an **adult** what they can and can't do with THEIR body,THEIR fate,THEIR life? NONE.  


11-Would you really want to die because of a North Korean /Chinese(or even *Russian)*nuke? No? I didn't think so(and neither do I.)  


12-Family? Friends?Coworkers? Sure they'll be sad,but know this:People are stronger than you think...if you off yourself,they WILL be beyond broken up,but given time,they'll survive(People die ALL the time,you know.)They WILL recover,they WILL move on...trust me. Remember the phrase ""Gone but not forgotten"".  


So tl;dr:Suicide is YOUR choice and YOUR call. And all it is is just speeding up something that will happen to us anyway. I mean,sure you want to live a long life,but do you REALLY want to get to 90+ and you can't even take a piss by yourself?

13,"For as long as i can remember, I have had nightmares. They come and go in these sort of clusters. That makes me think of herpes, but it's similar in the way that the nightmares will happen for a few weeks and then disappear for however long they want to.

 It usually happens that I'll start randomly waking up in a panic, as if I've just had a nightmare. Then they become increasingly more memorable, to the point that I can still remember dreams I had when I was about nine years old.

Maybe I don't naturally remember those dreams, but I've just memorized them after telling people over and over.

It's 4.39 in the morning. I just had a nightmare and the only thing I can remember from it is that it ended with me begging my parents to sleep in the same bed as one of them, which I haven't done in years, but that's dream logic.

The rest of the dream was about a haunted vacuum cleaner. After my dad finally trapped it by plugging it into the wall, I asked him and my mother if I could ""just sleep next to anyone.""

Then I woke up staring directly at the other side of my double bed, here at my dad's house. Which left me more spooked than the nightmare itself.

Luckily, I'm a weirdo with an absolute love with cutesh aesthetics and tumblr's agere community. So I have a lot of plushies to protect me from spooky things.

That doesn't mean I'm getting back to sleep, but at least I'm not panicking.

14,"This post has taken me forever to write because I don’t know how to describe it properly. Basically whenever I have interactions with people, I always think about 
-did I say anything out of line
-what’s their view on me and that conversation
-did I give them any sort of reason not to like me

It drives me insane because i analyze the conversation and get bad thoughts which causes me to worry when there’s necessarily nothing to worry about. I’m constantly thinking about what other people think of me. I am a people pleaser and I do realize you can’t please everyone but it’s a constant thing.

i want to hate him or something. every waking moment i’m thinking about him. it’s so unhealthy and i don’t know how to fucking stop.  i’ve had so many people interested in me but i can’t just move on like everything is fine. it’s like i’m waiting for him and for what? he doesn’t want me. he doesn’t care. i don’t know what i want. i don’t know what i would say if we ever talked again. i feel like he’s not the same person anymore. i’m not jealous of his new relationship i’m just very hurt.

I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression for a good portion of my life and have done my best to fight it without medical care. Recently I went to a doctor because I was so so tired of having to fight so hard everyday only to have to start over again. I asked for advice, for help.  (I also got my flu shot because I thought, might as well, I have insurance). My doctor wrote me a referral for therapy because I was hesitant about medication. I haven’t been able to go to a therapist yet because I only have sundays off consistently and most offices are closed that day. 

Today I got a bill for $243. $243 to go to a professional and get a referral I haven’t been able to use and a flu shot.  That’s it. WITH INSURANCE

Basically the past couple years I felt like something is wrong with me mentally but I never fit any of the DSM diagnoses for any disorders. I feel numb or melancholy almost all time.

33,"This year was the first time in my 17 years of living I was ever supposed to celebrate christmas, or really any holiday for that matter. And long ago it was leading up to be an amazing time.

Lately with my financial problems I realised i wont be able to gift this year, like i normally do, even though we dont celebrate, I always gift, never receive but it just feels nice to do. 

I had the expectation and build up that this year, with my first ever girlfriend, we were going to spend it in some way together. Lately things have been iffy with my girlfriend, she has not been putting into the relationship and now has come with the news that she wont be here for christmas, and a good chance she wont see me until after my birthday, which was supposed to be my first time celebrating that as well.

My family relationship is getting worse and worse, I wont be having insurance to get my medications for my eating disorder, nor therapist for a good while. This saturday was the only chance left I had for seeing my girlfriend before she went, but she had told me I couldnt come due to her dad being there (parents are divorced) and how last time when he left it stressed her mum out the questions asked by him, which I said it was okay.

34,"So a few months back I was at this training exercise in the middle of the desert. It’s called “ITX” and it’s literally in the middle of nowhere. (29 palms/camp Wilson) 

We were out there for 2 months without cell service. If we wanted to get any service at all we would have to go to the parking lot which was quite far depending on where you were, then stand on top of tanks. 

Because of this, every day the tanks would be packed with people trying to get service so, it’s not wildly unheard of to over hear other people’s conversations. 

This girl was calling social security to and I’m quoting, “freeze my social security number” because “I fucked it up and posted it on Facebook now they’re opening all kinds of credit cards” she was on speaker and I sat there listening as the lady behind the other end was trying to explain to her that she can’t freeze her social and get a new one.. the girl got enraged said, “why can’t I freeze my number??? I can freeze my credit card and cancel my cards!!” And again she tried to explain that this wasn’t a credit card. 

She hung up and called her mother and again, “they won’t let me freeze my number”

37,"This just happened right now, but I’ve just had such a shitty semester, and this week has been extra rough and I might fail two classes this semesters after having a 3.5 gpa as a sophomore. College has been pretty much nothing but a disappoint so far and I’m pretty depressed, irritated, and angry most of the time. I’m sad that I’m commuting all the time, I’m sad that I don’t have what I perceive to be what other people have, and I’m sad I’ve had such a shitty semester.

I haven’t slept good for the past two weeks, and haven’t smoked weed in awhile so today I decided I might as well since my finals are two days away and I don’t want to do it the day before. Anyways, this relates to the situation as I was high right now, and my mom comes in to give me a good night kiss. I’m in the bathroom taking a poop and she’s about come towards me and I say “what the heck get away from me I’m taking a wiz,” kind of in a light tone, and she stopped and just turned around and left. I can tell she had a bad day too, so she just went to sleep and didn’t come back or anything.

I’m high right now and I’m just thinking like damn I don’t appreciate what I have, and like I don’t even have the communication skills to explain what’s going on, or kind of talk things out or anything like that. I bet she just thinks I’m such a prick all the time when I’m just depressed and sad about things and want to be left alone.

To be fair to me, my moms been the helicopter type all my life, and I went to the same high school she worked at, so she’s always been super nosey and intrusive. Like I remember she just dropped the name of my crush one time right in front of me bc i think one of the teachers she was friends told her, and she would search up my friends and see their grades to make sure they weren’t fuck ups or something. And here I am getting high 3-6 times out of the week, and just being all depressed and shit. 

And like I’m just thinking like why things have to be so complicated and like I’m just keep letting things being the way they are, since I don’t want to communicate or anything for multiple reasons, so I figure things will always stay the same and I’ll never have a true parent-child relationship.

I’ve flushed out so many of thoughts and I don’t even know what I’m asking but I’m just trying to pass my classes this week and make it out intact.",13Dec2019,1

39,"She was my present for my 8th birthday (I’m 24 now), she was black with copper color eyes and I named her midnight. Today was supposed to be a regular day, it’s my day off I was going to clean up my apartment and possibly do some laundry, nothing special. but everything changed since 9:15 in the morning, I was making some breakfast and she was just sitting there in one of the chairs like always. She didn’t show any signs that she was sick, I’ve always taken her to the vet to get her shots. I made sure she was always clean, she wasn’t an outdoor cat she’s always been an indoor cat. I don’t understand what happened it literally happened within seconds. 

I was opening the fridge and she came and rubs herself on my leg I don’t think much of it she always done that and then she walks away. I assumed she was going to go take a nap, and that’s when it happened. She made this weird sound and just dropped and started shaking. She shakes for about 5 seconds and then nothing. 

I didn’t know what to do, I rushed over to her and tried  to pick her up but she was limp. My heart started racing and I called out her name, I couldn’t feel her pulse and my dumbass tried to do chest compressions on her.  And then it got worse my dog Toby heard me and he was coming over and I yelled at him to go back in the room I didn’t want him near me she threw up a bit. 

I rushed over and locked him in my room. I didn’t know what to do. I got hysterical and I just cried for the next two hours. After calming down a bit I started googling what to do with a  pets dead body. I found a nice little funeral home for pets and called to see what were my options. First of all I want to say that person who answered the phone was so kind and sympathetic, he didn’t rush me, he understood the situation, and we were able to move forward as calmly as possible. 

They were going to pick up her body up in about an hour or so, he told me to put her body in a box or to wrap her up in a blanket. I got her bed and her blanket, oh god that was the hardest thing to do, wrapping her up and putting her on her bed. I clean up the vomit, tried to calm down a bit and called my mom. I had to fully control my voice I didn’t want to worry her or worse give her a heart attack with how emotional I was being. 

I thank God for my mother, she helped me calm down and told me I was doing the right things. She came and visited me after work, and tell me everything was going to be fine.She hugged me so tight and told me to think of all the good memories that we had. 

Looking back on all our memories I have to say it warms and breaks my heart at the same time. From all the scratches and biting to all the times I had to look down and watch where I step because she was either behind me or walking in  between my legs. To all the nights where she would jump on my bed and sleep with me, to all the times I had to chase after  her to  give her a bath. To the  first couple weeks when I brought Toby home and she was a little shit to him.  She eventually grow to love him and I just love those moments where I would catch them sleeping together. To the times she thought I was worthy of her sitting on my lap and to all our one-sided conversations which I pretended that she understood every single word I was saying. 

But I really do  hope for those last few moments of the guy picking her up and taking her way be forgotten very soon. I have to say I didn’t  think it would be this painful to lose a pet. I didn’t think I was capable of crying this much for a cat. For real my own father died and I barely shed a tear for him.  I just have to say before ending all this Toby is fine,  I let him out the room after I cleaned up the vomit he was fed and I walked him like usual . This whole experience is probably going to make me shower him with more love and appreciation.

45,"Rich assholes are destroying the world and drilling deep so that they can have more money in their pockets. Fossil fuels and plastic continue to destroy and pollute our world and environment. But electric cars work, in fact could've worked ages ago as well. We've found renewable alternatives to plastics. And sure, some of this renewable stuff isn't as cheap. But every big multibillion dollar company knows that it can just buy businesses that threaten it. Electric motors that rival ones that run on fossil fuels, if you can't beat em, just buy em? Hell, imitate them, and do leagues better and make even more profit. Buy all the solar panel companies. Charge ridiculous prices. Fix the prices with competitors so that isn't a ""monolopy"". All this vile capitalist shit is possible. So why continue to pollute the world?

Well, I think about the things we need, that we have to buy and pay extra for. People don't trust tap water anymore, they just buy scores of plastics. I wonder if Flint isn't going to be saved because water companies are making a killing selling them bottled water. Then eventually comes air pollution and bottled air. Hell, we'll lose so much of the nature we depend on as our climate crisis increases that we'll have to pay for more and more basic necessities. That's the name of the game in successful capitalism. Control the things people need, or convince people they need what you control. What's happening here is the former.

What if companies that are polluting our world continue to do so, because they expect returns proportionate to how much the world goes to shit. Just deprive people of things, and sell them back what you've deprived them of. Pollute the river so that your water will be bought. Make people sick so they have to buy your cure.

48," 

As my name says, mycrazyscreweduplife, my life is crazy. I find the humor in my life and thought I would just go ahead and share with the world. If I post a story a day, I would still have stories for months. I thought I would try to give reddit a chance, This is my first post. My friends and family have asked me many times to start posting my struggles in life, and I finally decided what the hell.

One night, I had went out to run errands. I came back about 10:30 so it was dark out. There are lights in our parking spots here at the apartment but they are not that bright. As I came around the curve to go in my parking spot, my headlights shown on the dumpster. In the brief moment that the dumpster was shining with my headlights, a HUGE possum came flying out of the dumpster. Of all places for it to run, it ran right under the car parked next to my truck.

Now growing up on the farm, I was always taught that possums carry disease. Even if they don't carry disease, they are mad as hell usually. If you corner one by accident, all you see is teeth, fur, and a long hairless tail come running your way. Not necessarily something that I want to deal with at 10:30 at night.

Now I am sitting in my truck trying to decide what to do. I am afraid the damn thing has crawled out from under the car and crawled underneath my truck. I was convinced the damn thing was going to bit my ankle as I get out of the truck. I decide what any normal person would do. I would scare it away so then I could get out and go into my apartment. I sat there for a couple of minutes trying to decide what to do. ( The dang thing was probably 3 states away when I finally decided what I was going to do. )

In a split second, I came up with my ingenious plan. I would open the door to my truck and lean out and I would bark like a dog. I knew the possums back home were afraid of our dogs and this would work. I opened up the door and leaned way down so my voice would go underneath the truck. I barked as loud as I could 4-5 times and then slammed the door shut. I looked all around and I didn't see anything running. I opened the door again and leaned way out and barked as loud as I could 4-5 times and slammed the door as loud as I could. If you were standing watching, you would have thought there was 3 Rottwiellers trying to get a steak outside my truck with all the racket I was making. Still nothing. I repeated the barking and slamming another good 3 or 4 times and saw nothing running.

I then decided to get the flashlight out of my glove compartment and make a run for it. There was a tree about 50 feet to the side of my driver's side door. I decided to open the door and jump as far as I could. When I landed, I would sprint to the tree. Now at this time, I was about 350 pounds. The thought of jumping and then running was an insane thought in my mind. More frightening, was a possum who might bite my ankle after being furious at being barked at for 10 minutes and then possibly thinking that it was being shot at repeatedly.

So the big moment came. I pushed the door open. I jumped off the side of the cab and I sprinted to the tree like Usain Bolt in the 100 yard dash at the Olympics. This possum was going to have to be fast to get a bite on my ankle. I got to the tree before my oxygen ran out. I bent over to catch my breath about to die. If the possum was smart, he could have chased me and bit my ankle then, but I was trying to survive at that point. I bent over a little bit and shone the flashlight under the truck. Nothing under there.

At this time, I saw movement over on top of the dumpster. I shone the flashlight over that direction. There, on top of the dumpster, was the possum. I swear it had a smile on its face after almost making me kill myself. At this time, in the grass about 20 feet from the dumpster, was my neighbor. She was standing approximately 30 feet behind my truck. She watched the whole thing. Her Schnauzer was sitting beside her judging me and looking at me like I had lost my mind. I waved and walked back to my truck, shut the door, and walked into my apartment like it was just a normal night in the neighborhood. She moved shortly afterwards.",13Dec2019,1

50,"This gets a little ranty, just beware please. I'm marking this nsfw because of the more graphic details of coffee spills and burns, especially the descriptions within Wikipedia sources.

I don't often comment in r/unpopularopinion, but when I do--

I caught a solid amount of flak earlier saying the McD's coffee spill lady (Liebeck)(I originally thought it was Starbucks and many years later because my memory isn't great going that far back) lawsuit should have never happened and, although it doesn't affect my life personally, I mark her lawsuit as the beginning of the occasional slews of lawsuits in recent years that started becoming increasingly popular, or at least reported on. [^(Here's a link to the wiki article regarding the case as well as the aftermath and the twisted reporting done by the media, which I didn't have access to nor pay attention to at the time.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebeck_v._McDonald%27s_Restaurants) ^(That article also links to ""Compensation culture"" which was a largely UK media cycle phenomenon, and largely UK propaganda, for what it's worth.)

**I'm not here to argue the semantics of the case. This purely is about my opinion, and what I need to get off my chest.**

I didn't know about the lawsuit until I heard people talking about it, but I never thought much of it because it had nothing to do with me. Apparently it's a huge deal to some people. I learned a lot about it this evening, and hopefully this is the last time I write on the subject.

Coffee is hot. This lady held the cup between her legs in a car with the lid off to put creamers in it and spilled it down herself because she was a careless moron. A careless moron doesn't handle hot fluids like that and she had nobody but herself to blame for that spill, yet she won in litigation which I now, more than ever before, believe was completely absurd.

That's my opinion and pretty much every person who responded said I was essentially a ""Sheep"" that was ""programmed by the corporate media"" to believe McDonald's was the victim.

Uh, no. These idiots don't facilitate what I think. I'm not a victim of anything thank you, you paranoid, tin-foil hat wearing, jack knob.

There's no excuse for moronic behavior. I'm not going to change my opinion for someone who cited a full Vox article and calls me a sheep without substantiating their position. The points they brought up only my argument stronger because, previously, I didn't know she splorted her steamy cup of joe all over her sub-naval cavity by quashing it with her old, rickety legs *excuse my euphemisms*.

Do I think McD should serve their coffee at a lower temperature? No.

Do I think McD should require ""Caution Hot"" warnings on their cups? Again, I don't see it as necessary. People should know hot liquids will mess you up if you don't respect them. Also, nobody reads that warning.

Do I think McD is at all in part to blame for this mishap? Honestly no. I don't need to explain, again, how this lady thigh-choked her morning jolt. **She should have asked for a drink carrier if she didn't have a cup holder** ***call me a victim blamer*****.**

All of these questions could be something to base an argument on or at least advance the conversation somewhere useful. Instead I had some *truly* incompetent white knight start insulting me and trying to paint me as a victim as if he's somehow going to recruit me for his lunatic army of enlightened misfits.

I mentioned in my reply that I was at least thankful that they didn't cite a youtube video, but then I clicked on the first inline citation in the Vox article (mistake, I've blocked that IP range now) *and it took me to Adam Ruins Everything.. on YouTube.*

How double-translated do I want my facts? Well-- let me try finding real sources in a Vox article. Tell my family I love them. I understand Wikipedia isn't much better but I'm willing to bet this case isn't more then a shiny footnote in law school textbooks.

I think it's funny that when people go into an opinion thread, they are suddenly an expert. Mysteriously, they can't present their own opinion and relevant argument or even attack an argument directly. They instead decide they are somehow the self-proclaimed judge of what other people *actually* think and they can attack the person, as if it's somehow their duty or right to.

Honestly, if those people are serious and that's how they want to shape their decisions, believing they're always the victim of some heinous and superfluous action ""The Man"" has made to make everyone think a certain way, I'm flabbergasted. But not to the point that I won't make this post to get this stuff off my chest.

Somehow, they are furthermore graced by a handful of orange upboats from the edgy keyboard crusaders guild, likely with no input of their own nor any self-referential gauge on human idiocy.

I'm grateful that I managed to live free of the misery upon opinions surrounding such a dumb lawsuit for so long, and that I shall go back to enjoying life not being a complete nitwit.

I apologize for the brashness of this rant. I'm clearly amazed by the incredible mindsets of some people. How did they do it? I mean, genuinely, how did their parents rear them? Where did they learn to sympathize with an old woman who really fucked herself up? Her lawyers' case of cooler coffee possibly giving her a couple seconds to, what, react? She's 79 in the passenger seat parked in a spot after leaving the drive through. Her seatbelt is on and I don't think she's more agile than myself. I'd be just as burned even with a couple extra seconds.

I’m a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it so idk. Also when I only got a pub job myself without asking for her help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way .  When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I Looked to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley quiet way which confuses me because she gave me a furrowed eyebrows snobby look at me when she first called me over to the appointment which got me down


Edit: she started saying the ‘awww’when I’d get up to leave after I failed an interview for not having enough confidence but I usually would say ‘oh ok thank you’ is maybe why?",13Dec2019,1

67,"My boss is a nice enough person, but horrible at their job.  The job involves working with kids for around 20 hours a week.  

My boss is salaried and is only actually there at the same time as the kids for around 5 hours per week.  The ""enrichment activities"" my boss designs have several things in common, they are last minute, poorly prepped (the kids sitting around waiting for 10+ minutes while supplies are gathered is not uncommon) and often not enriching (such as watching a video and then answering questions).  

The educational part of the program is just as poorly run.  According to our mission statement we are supposed to help kids with their individual needs and provide them with homework assistance.  We are supposed to group them into groups of 5-10 and have a staff member work with each group.  In reality, we put them all on computers for 45 minutes, we sometimes have each grade do a different activity (but all on the same website).  
Though my boss is rarely there, we have a second-in-command who enforces my bosses will.  This chain causes other issues.  First the second-in-command often arrives late (5-10 minutes after the kids arrive), second the second-in-command usually doesn't know the plan for the day (has to call the boss to get the plan, since the boss plans things last minute and not days/weeks in advance).  

There are various other parts of the program goals that we fail to complete.  My boss is either lazy, doesn't care, overwhelmed or a combination of the above.  

The program is part of an organization.  So my boss does have a supervisor (and that supervisor has a supervisor).  The problem is, I have never met that person and has no idea who it is.  Maybe that indicates that incompetence goes up the ladder at my organization.  

I don't desperately need this job, so I've considered just quitting.  But I'd like to improve the program for the sake of the kids or at least attempt to - if I get fired after trying, so be it.  I've tried - as have other staff - talking to my boss and suggesting improvements, but it goes nowhere (boss expresses agreement with many ideas, then nothing changes).  Even that is difficult because we also never have any form of formal meetings and the boss is rarely there - or is working on last minute prep for the day.  

So I want to go to someone higher in the organization.  What is the best way to word an E-mail to a higher up supervisor whom I have never met?  Should I lay all my concerns in the E-mail?  Request to meet in person?  Something else?",13Dec2019,1

About two months ago, my relationship of four years ended abruptly. I came home one day, and she was sad. I asked her why, and she told me she wasn’t happy. She broke up with me and walked out the door. Gone for good. I wasn’t upset. I wasn’t pondering why she did what she did. I continued watching tv, wondered what I should eat for dinner. It struck me as odd that I was so lacking emotion over something so momentous, but I’ve never broken up with a girl before, they always break up with me. I thought that maybe I was ready to be done with the relationship and I just didn’t have the life advice to realize it. I had talked to my buddies about wanting to get out of my relationship so I could be a promiscuous bachelor, but I had considered it locker room talk and nothing more, I wasn’t being serious. A couple days later and fresh out of my relationship, I decided that maybe I should try to act on that locker room talk. I messaged an old love interest from high school and asked her what she was up to. Working the night shift at a diner. I told her I’d show up and then went back and forth for an hour about whether or not I actually wanted to. I was feeling lazy, didn’t want to leave the house. Screw it, why not? I make my way there and when I walk through the door I expect a warm welcome from the love interest and another one of my old friends whom I know to be working there as well. I go unrecognized. The old friend greets me as yet another customer and it’s only after I sit down at the bar and give a smile and a hint that she was missing something that I receive my warm welcome. A gleeful shout, and a waitress running around the end of the counter to hug me. It felt good, to hear someone get excited over me. The old love interest smiles at me, but remains distant. Not entirely out of character for her. I always liked her for it, actually. The love interest continues working, I chat with the old friend. We catching up on our mutuals and how our lives have been going. The love interest walks over to join the conversation during a break in the action and I reveal I’ve just been through a breakup, pushing aside the expected sympathy as I go. I explain that I wasn’t hurt by it at all, and in fact was rather excited at the prospect of being alone for a while. They commend me for being strong about it and then some of their newer friends come into the diner. I stand up, greet them, introduce myself, and retake my seat. We continue conversation for a while, with the two girls occasionally running off to service a table. Then, the old friend turns to me and catches me off guard.

“Why don’t you ever say swell anymore, that used to basically be your catchphrase.”

It was like a gut punch. She didn’t mean anything by it, and I don’t think she knew how her words affected me. I hope she didn’t. I responded by letting out the best fake laugh I could muster and telling her I wasn’t sure when the word had dropped from my vocabulary. 

In high school I was known for hanging out with a group of stoners, and very rarely being in any kind of negative mood. If anyone asked me how I was, how my day was going, or any other similar question, I would tell them I was doing swell. I loved the word, I thought it sounded very 50s of me, but at first I typically used it sarcastically. No one ever seemed to notice. My reputation was a happy-go-lucky guy, so they always heard the word but never the sarcasm, and I came to realize people fed off of my perceived positivity. It made their day better to talk to me, who just seemed positive for no reason. So I kept up the act, and it felt good. It started in freshman year and I don’t think it stopped until I graduated. 

The sarcasm came from somewhere else. When I was in middle school, I struggled to make friends. I had finally managed to make one good friend in school before I was uprooted after 8th grade and my family moved across the state. Not two weeks before the move, my dad had discovered my mom was cheating on him. I had heard of the horrors of a divorce long ago, and I had been so proud of my singular family unit. Their split tore me apart far more than I ever told anybody about. My mom tried to justify her actions and I came to hate her for a time. She also started abusing alcohol. My father became temporarily absent from my life. The drama of their divorce and the fighting between them would last for almost half a decade, and it hurt like the day they first split every time I heard a shouting match occur. I spoke to nobody about it. The first time I answered a how are you question with the word swell, it was sarcasm coming from the pain of having to chose which of my parents to live with, and which to betray. At least, that’s how it seemed in my eyes. 

People loved my unique response, for some reason, and it’s really what created my reputation. It’s what brought me out of the shell I had kept around myself for the entirety of middle school and half of my freshman year. Brianna Gambino, if you’re reading this, thank you. Reaching out to a complete loner in his first couple of days at a new school was bigger to me than you could ever have imagined. So I became swell personified, and it made me genuinely happy. The people I surrounded myself with were always in a good mood, and I attracted people to me by just being the happiest one in the bunch. The old friend, who was still a new friend back then, once told me that I was ‘such a heartfelt person’ and it still makes me happy to think about. Almost every day was fun in some way. Whether we were kicking around a hackey sack, chatting loudly at the lunch table, or terrorizing our town in our cars after school, it was always bright days and laughs. As we got older and closer to graduation, some of the faces changed, but the attitude never really did. 

When I graduated I thought life was going my way. After being single for a while I got a girlfriend. We had met in math class during school but I really just reconnected with her out of boredom one day and it led to the four year long relationship I mentioned at the beginning. We spent every day together, and at first it was great. As a matter of fact, it was great for about three years, with one or two bumps in the road as you would expect. When we moved into our apartment, things finally turned sour. We were broke, first and foremost. Every bill was late by a couple days while we waited for a paycheck, and if I worked more to compensate, we never saw each other. We started to lose our intimacy. She would complain about the way I was living my life, like playing video games late and ordering food deliveries, and I slowly changed. I got rid of my game systems, I stopped ordering food, and I decided it was time to get a new job. Each change made me feel a little more pent up. These were bad habits I was tiffing myself of, but they brought me temporary happiness. I searched for an eternity for a job as our interest in one another slowly waned, and as a Hail Mary attempt I interviewed with my dads company. I didn’t want the job, I was happy with the one I had, but I wanted to save my relationship. She broke up with me the same week I was to start this job I got for her. 

“Why don’t you ever say swell anymore, that used to basically be your catchphrase.”

All of these memories came rushing back when she said that. All that I had done, all that I had been through, and all the ways I had changed. I was cold, uncaring, apathetic, where I used to be a warm, friendly guy who cared more about other people’s problems than my own. I had no more happiness, nothing to smile about. Realizing the weight of the depression I was in cut deep. I couldn’t tell how long I had been going through it. I didn’t want to talk to anybody about it. I was consumed by my own thoughts and sat there in the diner wordless as conversation flew around me. I eventually came back to reality and left. 

I went 45 minutes in the wrong direction that night, not even knowing if I was trying to get home or not. I knew the way, but I didn’t follow it. Did I really want to be out of that relationship, or did I not actually care? Should I have felt pain over the breakup, or was it still to come? Was this emptiness I was feeling the thing that made her unhappy in the first place? Was my desire for promiscuity because I felt like I lacked happiness in my life? I didn’t know, and I still don’t. I decided to feign pain towards my ex so she wouldn’t be hurt by the idea that I just didn’t care, that I still don’t. I never shed a tear over her. I went home that night, curled up in bed with my dog, and cried silently, feeling like I was missing something, but not knowing what. 

I’ve gotten better over these last few months. I have become more competent at work, and that feeling of accomplishment has helped with my mental state. Certain people have helped me come out of it as well. I ended up missing my ex for about a weekend, but not romantically. I missed my friend, not my girlfriend, if that makes sense. Having someone that close to you for four years only to have them suddenly absent from your life is never going to lack an effect, and I am grateful it was so minimal for me. Needless to say, though, I’m not so swell anymore.",13Dec2019,1

Now, the boy who was showing the cuttlefish was showing his hands to his siblings and I’m guessing there was something on his hands as his hands had a sheen or mucus different to a water sheen.

I was afraid for him and everyone who touched the cuttlefish for the muscles of the cuttlefish contain a highly toxic compound and their poison is considered extremely toxic and can be as lethal as the poison of the blue-ringed octopus.

99,"My S/O and I have been together for nearly a decade. Last month she asked what i wanted for my birthday, knowing she probably wouldnt be able to get me anything, I said 'just some good birthday sex'. Ive told her what makes it good is not having to initiate it, since I'm the only ine who does, and that just makes me feel I'm not worth the effort. 

Well yesterday was my IRL cake day, the night before i showered, shaved, and made sure I'd be fresh in the morning for some morning head. Well noon came around and she was still asleep so i got up and decided to watch some Netflix, 2pm she had to leave for a doctor's appointment. When she came back, we had dinner with my family, they left and still nothing. So I decided to watch two episodes of the new season of The Expanse. After that i put on some YouTube as some background noise and played on my phone, waiting. Hours went by and still nothing eventually she fell asleep so I decided to be petty and let her sleep on the couch – not waking her up to come to bed. Eventually she came to bed. 

Maybe i should have brought it up, but i count that as initiating it. I just wanted that feeling of being wanted, like when we were younger and id come home from work and she'd rip my clothes off as i got through the door. Thats what i wanted for my birthday. You dont get that by forcing it. 

 I woke up today depressed and feeling a little salty. I thought maybe she just forgot, i made some comment like ""man that was some good birthday sex yesterday"" she takes it as a joke and says ""I know, right""

I know sex isnt everything and its never owed, and maybe i should just count myself lucky that she spent part of the day with me. but I cant help but feel a bit mad and really self-conscious.

102,"The Holidays are among us, which means the majority of us will be spending time with family members.  And it's not always easy being around family who are inappropriate or negative, so I wanted to share a few tips that you can use to deal with difficult family members and actually enjoy yourself during the holidays.

I've made a video about it here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqvDoqRCdjU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqvDoqRCdjU)

Or if you prefer reading:

1.Set Expectations

If Aunt Sue always complains about ALL the drama going on in her life, guess what’s going to happen when you see her again? She’s going to complain about all the drama going on in her life. If Uncle George tends to try to guilt trip you because you haven’t visited him enough, guess what? He’s going to try and guilt trip you. So don’t be shocked if a family member does something that you always find annoying. Because chances are…they haven’t changed. So, before we leave the house to visit family, we can prepare out mindset that these things will probably happen so we won’t be as caught off guard when they do. So, once your run into Aunt Sue you can be like.. “Oh yep..that’s Aunt Sue talking about her drama again” or “Yep, Uncle George is guilt tripping me again. Shocker.”

2. Plan Around Your Triggers

What does your family do that always sets you off? Is it when your mom starts treating you like a 5 year old again the moment you step into the house? Or is it when your dad turns into a negative Nancy when you’re all trying to have a nice meal together? Knowing what triggers your emotions BEFORE spending time with family will help you to create a plan to navigate around those triggering experiences or it can help you avoid them altogether.

3. Prepare Your Responses

We’ve all gotten them. We’ve all gotten the good ole’ awkward, intrusive questions like “When are you getting married?” or “Why haven’t you lost weight?” or “When are you having kids?” So, what we can do to handle that kind of situation is to make an emergency list of subjects that you can use to change the conversation. Or you could even prepare a list of responses for questions you’re anticipating. You can try using humor in your responses, like if someone asks when you’re getting married you can say “I’m really happy right now and in no rush to get married. But feel free to send me money and a gift anyway.” or just completely change the subject “I don’t really want to talk about getting married, but I WOULD like to talk about how amazing this gravy is. Aunt Betty what ingredients did you use to make this gravy?” If someone keeps persisting, feel free to excuse yourself from the conversation.

4. Ask Questions

If someone usually asks you inappropriate questions or if you like to avoid being the center of attention, the best way to get the attention off of yourself is to ask other people questions. This not only gets the attention off of you and on to someone else, but it gives you a chance to connect with a family member and you might even learn something new about them that you may not have known before.

5. Don’t Bring Up Off Limit Topics

Politics. Gossip. Death. These are few of many topics that should be off limits, so you don’t get into any emotionally fueled arguments or conversations. Try sticking with more positive subjects such as what’s happening around you in the room, or happy childhood memories, or travel plans, or even favorite tv shows.

6. Avoid Drama

Who knows how to get under your skin more than your family? If you’ve got a family member who is trying to push your buttons, don’t take the bait. Stay cool and don’t enter into the drama. Because when you don’t engage, the drama ends. This could mean you quickly change the conversation or excuse yourself and leave the area if you have to.

7. Take Breaks

Don’t feel obligated to stay with your family the whole. entire. time. Taking a breather every now and then can help you regroup if you’re feeling a bit overwhelmed. You can find another room to chill in or go for a walk. It’s ok!

8. Put Yourself in Their Shoes

Your cousin who’s a bit passive aggressive, your sister who is a little controlling, your mom who is a bit critical…there’s a reason they are the way that they are. Something has happened that has caused them to act this way or they’re fighting a battle that we know nothing about. Maybe your mom lost her parents and it’s hard time of year for her. Maybe your sister is going through some tough times with her business. Maybe your cousin is having a few family problems at home. I guarantee there’s more to them than what you are seeing right in that moment. This doesn’t excuse their behavior, but it helps you understand why they may be acting in a certain way. Showing a bit of empathy can help us look past the rude behavior and not take it personally.

9. Look for the Good

Yeah your family may have annoying habits. Yeah there may be family members that drive you crazy. But if we go in focusing on what we dislike about each person, we’re not going to have a good time. So let’s look for the good in each person. Before you get to the family gathering, grab a pen and paper and write down something that you like about each person. Focus on that the whole time you’re there. Because when we focus on the good, it’s going to life our mood and we’re going to have more of a positive experience.

10. Know What You Can Control

You can’t control what people do. You can’t control what people say. But you CAN control how you think, what you do, and what you say. Sometimes it’s easy to assume our old roles when we step into the house, like reacting when your brother starts teasing you or getting upset when your family picks on your for being the youngest. But you don’t have to be that person anymore. You’re a grown adult and you get to choose how you respond. Show them the leveled up person you’ve become.

11. Focus on Adding Value

Instead of solely thinking of our family as obstacles to overcome, let’s focus on how we can add value into their lives. What is one small action or gesture we can do to add value into someone else’s life and make their day better? Maybe that’s really listening to the story grandma has already told 100 times when everyone else is ignoring her. Or Maybe that’s volunteering to help out with the dishes. When we focus on adding value, it helps us to shift our mindset from “What am I going to get out of this experience?” to “What can I personally do to make someone else’s life better today?” When we have this kind of mindset, we have the power to transform each and every moment. Even if you don’t receive the same kind of gesture back, you are teaching others through your actions how to respect and value other people.

12. Change Your Mindset

You’re with your family on this special occasion to have fun – not merely survive. And if our mindset is “I’m not going to enjoy this holiday” “This is going to be the worst day ever” guess what? We’re not going to enjoy the holiday and it’s going to be the worst day ever. But if we go in with the mindset of “No matter what, I’m going to enjoy this day and the people around me as much as possible” then our brain is going to go in and look for different ways on how to enjoy the day. If something doesn’t go right or someone says something that strikes a nerve, remind yourself of that mindset and continue to constantly look for the positives. Don’t let a bad 5 minutes cause you to have a bad day.",13Dec2019,1

The person I thought really liked me, decided once again his friends are more important than the girl he claims he has feelings for. I'm backburnered on an already really really awful day. I know tomorrow I'll wake up, and be ok again, but for now, I just want to be held and cuddled and to be told that everything will be ok. Is that too much to ask?",13Dec2019,1

112,"I’m a college student about to be homeless but i have 2 jobs and am currently trying to pay for school out of pocket for next semester. Life has been cruel to me for the last 2 years or so and I’ve been stressed out  everyday which is why i smoke weed and workout a bunch to try and help alleviate the stress and it helps but sometimes it doesn’t. I just want something good to happen to me for once and I’d be able to breathe easier and live life to the fullest without these stressors but the things about life is that with one stress gone many more pop up and I’ve come to terms with that. The thing is id much rather stress over school and girls like every other 20 year old man instead of real life things but I cannot control it.

113,"Since May of this year, I have had major issues with swallowing food properly. It isn't painful, but it takes quite a bit of force, for even something like ramen noodles.
In the past couple of months, I've noticed that I tend to ""slip"" while chewing, and I end up biting myself.

The night before I was vibing in the living room... With my vibrator. I made a quick note to move/hide my wand before the installers arrived, but I forgot. 

They showed up early and I let them in the house, and I instantly saw it. One of the men got his buddy's attention and head nodded towards it and smiled. The other saw it and his eyes got big. 


I was freaking out high key because I was embarrassed, but the workers were awesome and didn't make things weird at all.

116,"Yesterday I was heading home as usual but for some reason I took more notice the people around my campus. All the hugs that were exchanged and caring for each other. That’s when I realized that no one does that for me. Who has ever complimented me, hugged me, told me that they care. I respect people and make them laugh but that’s as far as a relationship with a person goes for me. I know that I shouldn’t compare myself but I’m tired of this image that people think I’m that happy, funny person that looks well, when in reality I’ve never developed a deep relationship with anyone enough to care. That’s what made me cry. Maybe it’s because I’m not nice enough, or attractive, or talented, but it’s really hard to keep this shit going when no one offers me emotional support. And it’s really hard to focus on my school work when these thoughts keep bothering you. I cried for a couple minutes and didn’t tell anyone. So yeah that’s it, had to get that off my chest.",13Dec2019,1
117,"I was talking in a group of friends and totally unprompted, one of them said “I just don’t understand why you’re single. You should have girls all over you and I just can’t understand why you don’t” then she listed a few good things about me. To her, it was probably just a passing moment.

What she doesn’t realize is that I never feel like I have worth to girls. I’m confident, and I have SELF worth, but I always feel like someone would be “settling” for me. I’ve gotten into good shape physically. I know I dress well. I have lots of interests. And I know I have good social and personal qualities. But when I look at those things through the lense of dating, I still just never feel like enough. I understand why I’m like this, and I think I’ll be seeing a therapist soon.

In the meantime, I really thrive off of positive reinforcement from people close to me, and this one exchange was the jackpot.",13Dec2019,1

121,"Aight, hear me out.

 If every male on earth got a boner at the same time, the earth's Y rotation would slow down. Assume there are about 3.8 billion males, with an average dick height of about 80 cm off the ground. The average dick weighs about 100 grams. That's a combined mass of 380,000,000 kg of cock. Now we must make an approximation. For simplicity's sake, let us assume the penises are all evenly lined up in a ring around the equator. The equation for moment of inertia of a ring is | = massradius2. The radius of earth is about 6.371 million meters. Therefore the radius of the approximated dick ring is 6,371,000 + 0.80 = 6,371,000.8 meters. | = 380,000,0006,371,000.8%2 = 1.542410°22 The Earth has a moment of inertia, | = 8.04x1037 kgm2. The Earth rotates at a moderate angular velocity of 72921159 x10°-5 radians/second. Using Conservation of Angular Momentum we can find the new rotation of the earth. L=lomega= 8.04x1037 kgm2 \* 7.2921159 x 10\*-5 = 5.862861033. 5.8628610°33 = (8.04x10%37 + 1.54241022) omega -&gt; solve for omega = 7.292115899502489e-05 This is 4.97511e-15 rad/s slower than earth's original rotation. This translates to 6.75210-10 seconds = 0.6752 nanoseconds longer per day. If we all have a boner at the same time, we will collectively be able to last 0.6752 nanoseconds longer in bed.

I'd get attention from them, which made me feel nice, but afterwards I'd feel disgusting, and delete everything. Then after a while I'd feel empty and lonely again, and so the cycle continues. I don't know why I'm like this. i figure since I'm suicidal and don't expect to be around any longer, might as well do something adventurous and fun, but after that initial thrill fades, I'm left feeling worse than when I started.",13Dec2019,1
123,"I started off my college career by going to the institute of technology of my state, and I wasted my time and did nothing by failing all of my classes except one, which was English and I’m a comp sci major, ironic I know. My parents found out about me failing my courses and sent me to my local community college to makeup for it, which I’m so happy happened. I got my shit together at this community college and so far have a GPA of 3.8, and will get 3 A’s out of 4 courses this semester (which is my second). I am now looking to apply to 4 years again as a transfer, and I need my associates to transfer all my credits to whatever university I go to. However, since I’m about 4 courses short, I have to take 9 more courses in order to get my associates. And while I can take two more semesters to finish up, I personally really don’t want to. I want to dorm so badly, all of my friends are having so much fun in their dorms and I’m stuck home at 20 years old, I want independence so bad and I want to have the true college experience. So since I have to take 9 more courses, I have to take 7 (22 credits) next semester and 2 summer courses, and btw I’m already taking a 1 credit winter courses. And I don’t know if I can do this, I don’t know if I can handle these 7 courses. 4 of these are computer courses, and some of them are kinda hard and require a lot of effort, and the other 3 include two easy electives and physics, and I’m shit at physics. So I’m truly terrified of not being able to complete my goal, what if I fail or have to withdraw two or more courses? I’d be screwed and have to wait an extra semester when I want to be in a university so bad. My friends in the university I want to go to are counting on me to come so we can get a 6 person suite and all live together. And also, I’ve withdrawn from 2 courses in this community college, and I’m scared that it will look really bad when they see that on my transcript and not take me in to the 4 years. I just want to join my friends at university and have a normal fun college life. I’m tired of being so left out while everyone else is having fun and I’m just stuck at home.",13Dec2019,1

We had made a life together and then he ripped the rug right out from under us.  He said the heavy words, but I did the heavy work.  I was left to separate our things and box up what was left of my life on my own.

125,"As the title says, I was meant to fly home last Saturday for my mini Christmas as I couldn't afford a plane tickets on actual Christmas. I have lived abroad for 6 years now and only seen my family once during Christmas, a year after my beloved Grandpa who was like a father to me, unexpectedly passed away. 

I somehow missed the online check-in by 20 minutes as I thought you can do it up to 2 hours before the flight - turns out it is 3 hours. I called the airline, explained the situation (the flight was delayed by an hour) and asked if I could check-in at the airport - the advisor said ""yes yes, you can, you'll be alright"". So I drove 2 hours to the airport only to find out that all check in desks were closed. 

I was devastated. I can only blame myself for missing the online check-in, I know that. But this meant that I will not get to see my family this month and I miss them a lot. I tried calling my mum but she was already asleep, so I tried my little sister who answered. She started crying straight away as I started apologizing and explaining that those 3 days we were gonna have with each other, were now not going to happen. 

I'm going to try to book a ticket for next month after payday, but I'm still so sad.. I just wanted to tell someone, really. Hug your family close when you see them, for me, and always check-in early for your flights. Learn from my mistakes!",13Dec2019,1
126,"Most of my classmates go out every weekend. I stay at home and play video games every weekend. Most of them had their first kisses already and I never had a gf.

My life sucks, it's boring.

I would like to go out more, but i am not that social and can't really start convos. I can understand why no girl likes me. I walk around with a stone cold face, except when i'm with my friends, which is mostly at school bc they're like me.

No one really recognizes me. I was in a group in school and went to the meetings every time, but they didn't recognize me outside of the meetings.

I have no girl-bestfriend (which i could need pretty much). I would never tell my best friend about the stuff that is stuck with me, as i don't want to seem weak (what i am clearly not). 

One time when a girl liked me, i fucked it up. Well, it would've been a long-distance relationship with a 1.5 h drive. Which was too far away for me and i thought that would be okay for her, but i think it wasn't. bc when i snapped her after a few days it didn't even get delivered, i think she blocked me and i might have hurt her feelings, which i am really sorry for, if i really have. But i don't think i will ever find out.

127,"They're always drunk and fighting. The house is disgusting. There's pet waste, pests, mold and who knows what other fungus everywhere. They have 10+ years of shit hoarded up everywhere. I don't even have a bed I have a mattress on the concrete basement floor that has springs poking out that I cover up with layers of duct tape. The basement floods all the time too and then they make me clean it up because if I don't nobody will and I'm the one who has to live down there.



I hate them they've been abusive my whole life and I don't want to talk to them ever again in my life but I have to live in their fucking house because I can't afford to go anywhere else.

129,"Sometimes I say something and someone will say something else that's sort of unrelated to what I said, so I say ""I didn't ask..."" But not intended to be rude!

And someone says that they know and they always get notifications every song and know when it's released on the exact time and date... I didn't ask. I was only saying a statement. Or if I say I saw a bird, I didn't ask if you have a bird or saw something more exotic... It's interesting to hear, yes. But I didn't ask...
When I say ""I didn't ask"", people assume I'm giving them attitude when I'm not. I don't understand emotions others portray due to my mental illness, maybe that's why I don't understand why they get so offended when I simply reply with that statement? I don't know.
