1,"Ik I shouldn’t stress about this therapy session but you give me a lot of reasons to.

1. When I was at the crisis center trying to tell you that somewhat hitting me that it was wrong . You got worse, you said I betrayed you,you yelled at me every morning that I was making late to work when In fact sometimes just thinking about getting yelled at  in the morning makes me late. I get anxious when I’m in the car with you bc idk if you do it on purpose or not but you choose when I’m trapped in the car to yell for no reason.

2. You got angry when I said Kim and I wanted you to come in. At least I’m still trying but you see my tears after you yell or hit me as abusive. Sure some kids have it worse but some kids also have it better. 


3. You deny , lie, blame , and tell anyone who’ll believe you’re the victim for validation or make them your flying monkeys. You even used my dad for that!",07May2019,1
2,"This past month or so has been rough. I had my first experience with self harm, a PLT nurse at the hospital said I was showing signs of emotional instability, deadlines and final exams have been stressing me out, I've had a few sessions with the school councilor which was helpful didn't solve anything entirely, I still feel like a glorified care taker for the dog, and to top it off my grandfather has terminal cancer. 
Since I learned about the diagnosis, my emotional issues have been amplified by a factor of 10. My mood was doing a complete 180 every 1-2 hours at work. Every time I was riding high, I felt like I had everything under control, and every time I felt low I was punching boxes and on the point of tears. There were moments when I started shaking uncontrollably, which was terrifying.
The stress keeps building because I've got no energy or motivation to do any work. I don't even smoke but I've been craving a cigarette all weekend. I know the health risks, I know my parents would be mad, I know my friends would be disappointed, but I'm 18 and can legally do as I please. I've started feeling the urge to self harm again but instead of burning I want to cut myself. I don't want to be a burden or upset my parents but I don't know what to do.
I just want to disappear or become numb to it all. I want my bed to collapse out from underneath me, leaving me to be swallowed by an endless empty void where everyone else goes about their day without realising or caring. Everyone's always asking for something from me, a moment of my time that I don't have to give away but would waste anyway.
The only thing stopping me from doing anything drastic or getting too upset is the fact that my Mam needs me. She needs help and support, and doesn't need to be worrying about me. She's slowly watching her father die, I can't have her scared for her son's well being on top of that. 
I just want to leave the house, go for a night walk, swing by the petrol station and pickup a patch of cigs, but she'd probably hear me and ask what I'm doing up so late on a school night.
I never thought we were really close, so I never really understood the ""Mom would be sad"" memes people were sharing, I was always more concerned about my friends and the responsibility I have to my coworkers. But now I do, because while my life feels like it's slowly falling apart, I need to at least act like I'm coping just so I don't add to her stress.",07May2019,3
3,"You know people respect me and think I’ve done well and certainly better than anyone expected. 

But I keep measuring myself against a ruler of expectations that I might never be able to meet like get married, have a family, have children etc.  I spend most of my time alone and don’t have any close friends.  I have friends. Beyond occasional boyfriends, no one very close. Went through a lot of trauma in my teenage years and twenties and honestly don’t want to be so close that losing everyone destroys me again.  Cause that’s what happened.  I left a religion and lost everyone in my life.  

Had a minor surgery this morning and took myself there and got myself home and took care of myself and just lying here wallowing in self pity that I’m all on my own.  

God I’d rather die than have to face much more of life alone.  I ask God all the time to kill me and think about dying a lot.  Miserable old bastard keeps me alive and I’m fucking bitter about it",07May2019,1

I noticed that I started to have less interest in hobbies I had such as playing video games and doing soccer. I still get good grades because my parents want me to and do soccer, but it all feels pointless and unenjoyable. I have not been excited about anything for a long time. My friends stopped hanging out with me since most of the time I have nothing to say and am honestly in my head most of the time. I day-dream a lot and think about random shit.

 https://imgur.com/a/NT4DrnG

On the side, if you zoom in, it has a sticker that says, “WARNING: Use only to dry hands and face. Any other use can be DANGEROUS.” 

Whenever I dry my hands I like to think of “dangerous” ways one could use this towel dispenser. “Maybe a kid dancing around it accidentally hangs themselves. But, that’s not a ‘use.’ Maybe wiping your ass could cause sores...” You know, just stupid shit to think of to pass time. I wash my hands upwards of fifteen times a day, so it’s just one of those stupid things that fills brain space.

So, a while back, as I was drying my hands, a coworker was washing his. I pointed to the sign, “read this, and give me the first “dangerous” thing you think of.” “Waterboarding.”

His response was instant. I finished the sentence he answered. As quick as you would answer the question, “what’s one plus one equal?” 

This shocked me a bit. I had never thought of waterboarding, before. “WHOA!!! What the fuck? Did you think of this shit before?” “Nah man. Just the first thing that came into my mind.” “How!? What the fuck?” “I dunno. Waterboarding is pretty dangerous. Just the first thing I thought.” “You’re fucked up, man.”

I dunno. Just never, in a million years would of thought of that. I’m now cursed to think, “waterboarding” every time I dry my hands...",07May2019,1

17,"I only remember my dreams if they have a message in them, pretty much.

Last night I dreamed of adderall,  vyvanse, and ritalin. I love stimulants. Music, cigarettes, information, sex. I have never really played video games, but I have a feeling that would get a hook in me too. Before the constant YouTube, smoking, pills and research; it was working out, art, making my own music, poetry, and nature. 

I quit adderall in February. There are times that I've torn through everything because I hid them from myself before quitting. The last time I went looking was last week. I still want them. They did help me, but I need moderation. Somehow, adderall was almost easy to kick because I knew I'd have to pass a drug test to get back on them. I won't pass right now, because I also smoke weed. Less harmful. 

I'm realizing I might be able to quit smoking cigarettes too. Probably with the patch. Feed the addict, spare the body from the many bad things that come with smoking. Try 30 + cigarettes a day... for an 108lb girl. If I could get back to working out, research, and sex I'd be quite happy. My birth mom was a call girl who overdosed. 

I don't want to end up like her. I want to connect with the addict in me and apply it to the things I want. I know I can do it, but only if my goals are the most stimulating things in my environment. It's not even about what I ingest, inhale, or repetitively do. It's about what it does to me. I'm so tired of wanting to quit. It's like I'm trying to kill myself moderately slowly.

I was literally born with drugs in my system. Maybe I will always be an addict, with everything, to my core. Maybe I can make that a good thing, accept the addict, and let her do her thing with all the things in life that I want more than death. I'm so proud of myself for actively thinking of ways to avoid pain, self loathing, and punishment. If it's all in my head, that might be the most important thing to change about me. I can feel myself becoming ready to let go of even more things as I begin to accept myself.",07May2019,1

19,"My mother has been a manipulative, abusive drunk since I was a toddler. I was her codependent sidekick through years 1-13 of my life, never once putting the blame on her when I definitely should have. I believed every lie she ever told me until I eventually moved in with my father (hated it at the time, but it was the best possible decision that could have been made.)

My mom's side of the family works in a sort of hierarchy, where my grandparents are King and Queen (they're the old bags of money that everyone is trying to get in good with, at least, thats what mom thinks). My mother, after years and years of being in rehab, out of rehab, over and over again, realized that our grandparents really weren't too keen on her anymore (they had been paying for her rehab stints).

So, mom's latest stunt was to fake a terminal illness, called **Multiple Systematic Atrophy.** Granted, this is a VERY real VERY painful disorder, but a very convenient one for my mom to choose, as a lot of the symptoms cross over with symptoms of prolonged alcohol abuse (shaky limbs, limited mobility, slurred speech etc). Normally, for this disorder, the prognosis is typically 5 years after symptoms show up until you're completely immobile/on death's door.

We're around year 6 at this point, and guess who's still walking upright, fine as can be? Well, fine as can be given the years of alcohol abuse (including hand-sanitizer drinking, did I mention that fun tidbit?) The consensus of my aunts and uncles and myself is that my mother (an ex-doctor) had access to brain scans of a patient who had this disease, and is claiming they're her own.

I realize others may think that I'm being too skeptical, but this has happened before. When I was 10, it was a mysterious heart valve disease that magically disappeared under a year later. Then her liver failed due to some liver disease (really, just her being a drunk and killing her liver.) This is just part of the cycle.

She recently posted on her facebook a wedding photo with her husband (my step father, who she has tricked.) A lovely photo, they're both smiling and happy. What does the caption say? ""Lovely day with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_, **before I was sick.""**

I see comments on her posts from family friends, those who have known me and supported our family since I was an infant, being genuinely heartbroken with news of mom's ""illness"". My heart breaks for them. Sweet ladies that we used to go to church potluck with, all being manipulated.

My mother has stopped contacting me entirely, either because 1) she's aware that **I'm** aware that she's not sober and is ashamed (unlikely, I don't think she feels shame) or 2) she's realized that she can no longer manipulate me, and has nothing more to gain from maintaining a relationship with her daughter. Probably the latter.

And it's for that reason that I don't have the heart to tell these people the truth. I will either be labeled a liar, or dragged back into my mother's codependency and toxicity. I am now 19 years old and am preparing for the rest of my life... a life that I clearly cannot share with my mother.

I realize how bitter and angry this post sounds, but it comes from a place of utter heartbreak and dismay.

My mother, believe it or not, is an absolute genius. She was a very high ranking doctor for many years, and was the star of her medical school, college, and highschool long before all of this. She's wickedly clever, and I believe an absolute psychopath (or sociopath, I can't recall the difference). All she knows how to do is to try and make herself look good to other people. Every word out of her mouth was calculated and with purpose.

It is for that reason that I think her choice of a **terminal** illness, this time, was intentional. I think she intends to kill herself.

My mom is depressed, and has been since birth. Never had a suicide attempt, to my knowledge, but I recall dozens of times in my youth where she'd get absolutely shitfaced and start sobbing about how useless of an existence hers is. I think her choosing a terminal illness is a convenient scapegoat for her to kill herself in a few years' time. Who knows. I certainly don't... I've given up trying to figure out what she's thinking.

And to be honest, I don't really care anymore. I spent so many years of my youth thinking she was my responsibility... that because I was her daughter, and her ""best friend"", I was the only one who could fix her. I was young, I was gullible, and I was a victim of emotional abuse.

So I'm going to take my mother's ignoring me as a gift from the universe and let it be. To my friends, my mother died years ago (saying that is far easier than explaining the truth of where and who my mother is). But, I will be completely honest when I say that I am so beyond heartbroken that this is where our lives have led. My mother doesn't even know that I've made the Dean's List these past 2 semesters, or that I'm in the honors program. She doesn't know (and likely will never know) just how hard working of an individual I am, and that I am a daughter that any parent would be proud of.

She'll never know the extent of how much she's hurt me. She'll never know that I am terrified of any romantic relationship because I'm afraid I'm too much like her, that I'll end up a manipulator. She will never know how badly she's ruined my life, and how hard I've had to work to undo even a fraction of the damage she's inflicted on me.

Even if she did know, I don't think she'd care. She'd just bring the discussion back to her illness anyway.",07May2019,0
20,"So I started out running after doing P.E. in 7th grade. (I'm a Freshman in high school currently) when I first ran 1 mile my time was a 7:45 and I don't know if it was good or bad but in my mind I saw it as bad and that I could I'm prove on it. By the end of my 7th grade year I got that time down to a 6:08. I felt extremely happy about that but knew I could do better. 

Skip to my early year of 9th grade and my time went back to around a 7:00 and that might have to contribute to be being in band for my 8th grade year. So I'm running and I finally get it down to a 5:51 and I was so happy. That used to be my limit but I have joined a NJROTC program and do fitness exercises 5 days a week. 

Today we had a P.R.E. (physical readiness examination) and keep in mind I was not wearing my running shoes so my feet were a bit heavy and it was about 90° outside. So my instructor says ""Ready, get set, go!"" And starts the timer.

 So I'm running just focusing on rhythm and breathing and also that I have to push myself to pass someone who I usually don't. I hear him say my lap times and I think I'm getting slower and slower but I wasn't. I was getting faster and faster. I finally pass him but he passes my at the last curve before the 100m strait and I start sprinting for my life. I do pass him again and I felt so much joy. So I keep going, and going, and going and pass the line and hear my time. Keep in mind my old time was 5:51. But somehow a miracle happened and I got a flat 5:40. I increased by a whole 9 seconds. 

New PR in 5:40 1 mile time

We also did pushups and situps. 
Pushups: 85

28,"About four weeks ago I visited my grandfather for the first time in about a year. I moved away to a new country for college, and he's incredibly proud of me and all that I'm doing. I told him that where I'm living is incredibly expensive, and that I'm barely making ends meet from balancing my job and living expenses. Without a question, he wrote me a check for $5000 to cover a year's worth of tuition. I couldn't believe it.

I deposited the check, and today I'm still living my life as frugally as I was prior, because I still need to save up for living expenses and textbooks.I went to pay my tuition bill for the next year, which came out to $4975 with fees. It hurt to enter my credit card details. 

However i realized something and my heart instantly sank. Tuition costs $5000 in the local currency, but about $3800 in his currency. I actually have $1200 left over.

I want to let him know and return it, but that's nearly 4 months of rent, and I'm absolutely broke. I eat spaghetti 4 nights a week and scrambled eggs. This could seriously give see breathing room, just for a little bit. Just to build up a cushion in case something unexpected happens.

I took a gap year after high school thinking it would help me sort myself out. I needed that break but I’m still lost.

31,"The moment our parent’s left us crying in the kindergarten classroom, was the moment we’ve taken a plunge into the ‘River of Structure’. The ‘River of Structure’ provided us with daily, weekly, and yearly tasks to complete. For most of our lives, our schools provided a defined structure with clear cut goals and rewards. And without fail, once we completed one task another one was always provided to us free of charge…whether we wanted it or not.

&amp;#x200B;

And with every grade passed, we advanced to a higher level. Just like that, we had new people to meet, new friends to make, and the tasks scaled to our level. All we had to do was follow the flow of the River. By the time we’ve hit our senior year in high school, we’ve been riding the ‘River of Structure’ for so long that we’ve forgotten that this river was going to end sooner or later.

&amp;#x200B;

As we stood in our caps and gowns, struggling to find our family members in the sea of people, ‘it’ hit us like a roaring rapid.

&amp;#x200B;

‘What do I do next?’

&amp;#x200B;

The feeling of complete Freedom or Choice Paralysis.

&amp;#x200B;

‘Get a job or attend college? Many decent jobs require a college degree now…so I might as well go to college.’ - was my thought process. So, off I went to college.

&amp;#x200B;

As I neared the end of getting my degree, I couldn’t help but wonder how many students attended college because they were accustomed to this ‘River of Structure’. When faced with the wide-open Ocean, they chose the comfort of something familiar, even if it wasn’t their strong suit.

&amp;#x200B;

I personally chose to attend college because of the structure that I was used to. I was afraid of entering the open ocean and creating my own quests and goals.

&amp;#x200B;

After graduating college, I was faced with the same dilemma my high-school self faced. I gazed at the Ocean and wondered if I was ready. Should I further my education or should I start looking for a job? I decided the time and money needed to attend graduate school wasn’t for me. I jumped into the ocean of life with the deteriorating raft that was my mind and quickly realized how calm it was. Compared to the River that previously governed my life, there was nothing for me to do. For the first time in my life, my quest book was empty.

&amp;#x200B;

I had no direction. What to do? The day's flew by at an alarming rate. Everyday I realized I had accomplished nothing. I would wake up, perform my routine (job, house work, etc.) and go back to sleep. Repeat. I had realized something was wrong but didn't know how to fix it.

&amp;#x200B;

I eventually realized I would have to make my own goals and quests (took me a while though). I had to put effort into maintaining friendships, planning events, learning new skills, hobbies, and other things i took for granted when operating in a structured environment. I started looking for a career. Of course, I initially looked for jobs relating to my field of study (Psychology) and began branching out. I bounced around jobs for a short while…some of which loosely related to my degree (Social Service jobs). While I enjoyed them, the pay wasn’t as joyful. To make a long story short, I ended up getting a career (with better pay, benefits, and work-life balance) thanks to the CDL License I had gotten on a whim, years prior.

&amp;#x200B;

So is the ‘River of Structure’ worth the extra 4 years…possibly more?

&amp;#x200B;

While a college degree has basically become mandatory for most jobs, there are still well-paying careers that don’t require 4 years of traditional College education. And the disoriented feeling I had after graduating is difficult to describe. I'm not sure if other's have experienced it as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, myself, and many of my peers, are in careers that have nothing to do with our field of study. I graduated with a 3.97 GPA (brag about it…, huh?), others barely reached the requirements to graduate. But, the results were the same. A degree that we may never use. Was it worth it?

&amp;#x200B;

But whatever choice we end up making, we eventually have to face the Ocean. We have to decide what is personally valuable and worth spending our time on. While life got harder after college, it did become better…if that makes sense.",07May2019,8

33,"Over the past couple of months I’ve been dealing with a pretty awful break up with a long term boyfriend that was extended due to us being temporarily long distant during college.

The break up was hard on both of us. My ex fucked up, we broke up, he wanted to get back together and I stopped it. What hurts most is that he is genuinely an amazing person and we were each other’s best friends, just getting back together after everything wouldn’t have helped us.

We decided to take a day to share all our feelings, and afterwards just enjoy each other’s company like a last date. After feeling miserable from the break up drama, have a day with him made me forget how happy he could make me (I didn’t change my mind about getting back together).

When the day was over, we both knew it would be the last time we would see each other. I am going back to college soon and we have no reason to talk to each other again.

We both started crying. I’ve cried so hard before it felt like my lungs were coming out of my throat but this time was different.

I cried like a child. I didn’t feel connected to anything, my body or the present. He held me and I was wailing and I just remember my mind was somewhere. It kept imagining random things like objects or images that had no relevance to the situation. I felt like I was losing my mind, I had a voice of reason trying to pull me back, but I couldn’t get grounded in reality.

My ex kept asking how I was feeling, he was so worried. After that I kept repeating hysterically “I don’t know” even if he didn’t ask me. There were times where i stopped being hysterical and just say silently and I couldn’t move my eyes. He said I looked empty.

I don’t know what brought me back to gaining control over myself. But I just remember thinking how scared I was of what just happened.",07May2019,2
34,"I’ve had Edgar since he was born. He’s five years old. My other cat, Willow, had gotten pregnant and I decided to keep one of them, so when the day came Willow died, i’d have a piece of her left. 


He was the biggest and most gentle cat i’ve ever met. He was 16lbs, and all he did was give you love. He would purr so loud and take up most of my bed when he stretched out. He had the prettiest coat; light grey and white stripes. Each paw was tipped with white fur except one of them. He had the cutest pink nose and biggest, round green eyes. He loved belly rubs. I think those were his favorite. He had the funniest meow and waited for me at my door every single day.


He had a blocked bladder and quickly deteriorated. Around 6 today, I called to check on him at the hospital. They told they weren’t sure if he was going to make it over night. After bawling my face out, I went back to see him, tell him goodbye. 


He was laying down with a green blanket covering him, and an oxygen tube next to his nose. He felt cold, even though he’s always so warm. He wasn’t in any pain, thanks to the medication he was on. I stood there petting him for around 30 minutes. I knew he was going to die, and didn’t want him to suffer any longer. Right after I finally agreed to let him go, I realized he’d already stopped breathing. The doctor confirmed that his heart stopped. I gave him a kiss on his head, and said “goodbye baby.”  


I’m devastated and heartbroken and i can’t even look at the box with his paw prints in it. I’m so upset i’m physically ill. I know he’s pain free and in a better place. I just miss him. It hurts so much, i just want to sleep. 


I love you so much Edgar",07May2019,43

I'm going to subscribe to audible so that I can listen to books while I drive, but I'd love some recommendations for books that contain lots of general knowledge/useful information and also things like economics and investing for beginners.

37,"I'm a female college student. Unsurprisingly the people around me are looking for as much sex as they can get. I prefer to be in intimate relationships even though I've never been in a real (healthy) one. I try to be as rational as I can in most situations, but I’m generally an emotional person. 

I'm fairly attractive and used to have hookups regularly. Sometimes those hookups became toxic relationships and I didn't have the emotional willpower to have casual sex anymore. 

An acquaintance and I got to know each other a little better and it turns out he was incredibly smart, emotionally and intellectually, and I found myself crushing over him. He was much more understanding than I was used to guys being, and it was a while since the last time I was with someone so loving. But he was very clear that he didn’t want to commit to a relationship in the moment because he likes his freedom and his past relationships were too emotionally demanding. So he made sure I knew that he had multiple casual sexual relationships with other girls and he would like us to be strictly friends/friends with benefits. 

At first I was like ""that's cool, I'm perfectly fine with that."" It was straightforward what he wanted and I had gotten better at detaching myself from hookups. But the first time we made plans to have sex, I suggested a time and he said he'd probably be able to make it. I like to be on time and I like others to be on time, or at least to have some communication about a change in plans because I have really bad anxiety. He never messaged me back until 3 in the morning. I knew he wasn't going to come way before then but I was so upset that I kept myself up anyways. 

Today he asked to come over and I reluctantly said yes. He did, and I just didn't feel super comfortable being around him. I knew there weren't any feelings on his part, and I knew that if I got involved with him I would just end up hurt. So I sent him away. I'm certain I did the right thing, not sleeping with him, but I felt so crushed. He made the effort to get me to trust in him and open up to him, but I know he doesn't think about me and I know I’m not special to him.  

That's what made me say, ""okay, I need to step away because this is not something that will be good for me."" I finally realized that I deserve to be loved for who I am as a person, for all of my negative and positive attributes outside of my physical attractiveness, and that I don't need to settle for anything else than that. 

I wouldn't say I have low self-esteem, but maybe I have low self-confidence. I've seen myself grow more and more guarded after being repeatedly abused and devalued by men. I'm making the effort to try to remind myself of my worth and to be more comfortable being as I am, whether people accept it or not, but to be smart about how much of myself I share with certain people. I know I’m young and I have hope that I’ll end up with someone who truly deserves me. And even if I don’t, I’m learning to be okay with that so that I never settle for someone who makes me unhappy. It just gets lonely. 

TLDR; I developed feelings for a guy who only wanted to be fwb. It reminded me that it was only infatuation and I only want a real relationship.",07May2019,10

40,"(Just wanted to rant about this somewhere, I don’t know what feedback anyone could possibly give but I guess it’d be nice if someone could comment something to just know I’m not screaming into the void lol)

My counselor canceled on me today very last minute and can’t see me for another two weeks. I really wanted/needed to see her so now I’m pretty upset. I’m not in a crisis so it’s not like emergency hotlines would help, I’m just frustrated and disappointed because I waited a while to seek help in the first place, and my first session was really disappointing so I was looking forward to this one. Now I have to wait a long time and I’m not sure what to do, considering this is a non-emergency issue. 

I want to explain/rant about why this minor mishap has got me so upset:

I just started seeing a counselor at my schools counseling center after waiting a few months to make an appointment. The issue wasn’t pressing per say, I just wanted to go temporarily to talk through my breakup, as it’s preventing me from focusing on school. Regardless of the lack of urgency, the wait was annoying - after I got the courage to call, I had to schedule 3 weeks in advanced. It’s a large college so fine, I get it, I was as patient as possible. 

Anyway, my first session was last week. I’m not new to therapy so I know how an initial session goes, but I’ve been to this counseling center before for a different issue so I expected a shorter “intake/assessment” session that normal, since they had my full history on file. I was also told it would be a longer 60-90 minute session when I scheduled over the phone, so I expected a short intake session followed by a full session to get a basis for my treatment. 

My expectations were not met on my first session (obviously, or I wouldn’t be outlining them in such detail above..). I met with a woman who was doing her residency or whatever for her psych grad degree, and she was obviously following her training to a T. By that I mean she was pretty stiff and not personable at all because she was making sure to say/do all the right things. It made me pretty uncomfortable but I figured I’d give her a chance. She was nice enough during the intake but she didn’t have my file so I had to go over my whole history again, including some things that weren’t relevant to why I was there. I have a history of mild/chronic mental illness and have been hospitalized/etc, but the worst of it happened many years ago and I have been managing very well lately. I still felt like I needed to disclose this information when she asked just for the sake of full transparency, so a good portion of my time was taken up by me explaining why I was hospitalized 7 years ago and my self harm that ended 5 years ago, etc. I didn’t even get to go too far into the breakup, or at least why I felt I needed counseling to work through it. 

I was only there for 25 min doing history stuff, after which she started to ask my availability for our next session. I was disappointed because I didn’t wanna wait a week to talk about the breakup while I had tons of homework that coming week that I was struggling to finish due to said breakup, but I didn’t want to argue so I set up another appointment for the next week (today). 

30 minutes before my appointment today, the office calls and says my counselor had to leave and that I’d need to reschedule. Okay fine, things happen, i tried to be understanding. But her next available appointment wasn’t for 2 weeks! I was taken off guard so I just said yes to the next appointment and hung up without thinking to ask for other options. I’m gonna call or visit tomorrow and see if I can see someone else, but that probably wouldn’t work well because they’d have to re do my intake if my OG counselor doesn’t share my file (I don’t even know if she could with privacy laws and all that). Plus, they seem really busy at the counseling center so I doubt it’d even be an option. 

I don’t want to wait 2 weeks. I’m experiencing a lot of anxiety over this breakup and I want to talk it through so I can get back on track with my school work. The longer I wait, the further into the term I get and the further I fall behind. I don’t want to sound like a selfish asshole, I’m sure she has a good reason for needing to leave and I hope everything’s okay with her. But it doesn’t take away how I’m feeling about the situation, and I’m unsure of what to do next. 

Sorry this was long and ramble-y, thanks to anyone who reads, it means a lot just to have someone hear (read?) me vent.",07May2019,2
41,"My wife just told me this morning that she wants to get a divorce. The news completely caught me by surprise, as I thought our marriage was going well. This evening after dinner she sat me down and told me she ""wasn't happy"" and that I ""don't make an effort"" and ""never spend time with her"" and all of her other typical whining topics. She cited my 95 hours of playtime in the past 2 weeks on Steam as an example that I am on a ""one way train to Loserville."" This really hurt, I know it seems like gaming is a hobby for losers, but gamers are some of the best and brightest people you will ever meet. At the time I couldn't believe the woman I love would say something so hurtful to me.

I tried explaining to her that there are skills and life lessons taught in games like CS:GO, The Witcher 3, Skyrim, and Minecraft that just can't be taught in real life. She didn't buy it and subsequently kicked me out of the house. I go over to my buddies house and explain to him what happened and he lets me temporarily crash at his place. As I am hanging out with him and venting I get a text from my (I guess ex?) wife. A picture of my mutilated $2500 (I make a lot of money) gaming PC in the garage next to a sledgehammer.

This is my worst realized. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. Everything I love in life has been taken from me so suddenly. I spent thousands of hours grinding, fighting, and gaming on that PC, it feels like I have nothing to live for now. That computer was everything to me. As I am writing this I'm sitting in my car with my Glock just crying my eyes out and trying to muster up the courage to pull the trigger. I know I need help but I can't even imagine life without by PC and my wife, it's too unbearable. What should I do guys?

46,"19m with two days until I’m packed up and off to go home

Before I came to college I was scared out of my mind. As someone with bad social anxiety, I was terrified to be in a new environment all by myself. I went in not knowing what was going to happen. Luckily, I went out of my comfort zone, made some great friends and had fun. The fall semester was so exciting. I went out a lot, had good grades, and was finally happy for the first time in a long time.

Then as the months went on, it got less and less exciting. I stopped trying to meet new people as I settled into my friend group, and life became a cycle. I didn’t join any clubs/orgs and life slowly got worse. Then when I went home in December I hit an incredibly awful depressive spiral. I was suffering for a while but I expected it to go away once I went back to college. But honestly life didn’t get any better, and I felt just as depressed and lonely as I did in high school. The only difference was that I had 1-2 friends that were really supportive and people I could be really close to.

Overall, the rest of semester (besides my grades) was less than stellar, and I’m very mad at myself for it. I didn’t join anything, I didn’t make many new friends, and I still feel like my life is missing something. 

This honestly scares me to death about these next 3 and half months. I’m afraid I’m going to get into a bad mental state and I’m afraid I won’t be able to handle it. Sure, I have people in my life at home who can help, but the only way to be happy is through myself.

So overall, I’m pretty disappointed in myself. I started off great in the fall semester, but then kind of fell off and didn’t do much during this spring semester. I also feel like I haven’t found my *true* people. Yes, I’m mostly likely going to visit a few friends here over that summer that live near me, but I feel like I’m missing something that I haven’t obtained here.

So I figured, hell, let’s just start a conversation and quiet the *what if?* monster for a few minutes. Hence, appointment.

I’m in my mid 20s, make more than any of my friends do by about double, and I work a job that’s higher in title/power than basically anyone in my life. Because of this, no one seems to see my issues as valid. I’m stressed about money, it just gets written off as nonsense. I stress about life purpose, people scoff that “you’re making ____ dollars you can do whatever you want”

I am in a position of power and have to make all my own decisions. There’s basically no one above me and if I do good, it’s the company’s win, but if I screw up then it’s my fault. 

I literally just want someone to hold me and let me be vulnerable for like an hour. I can’t cry because I feel weak to cry. I haven’t cried in probably a solid 5 years.

I stay in relationships that aren’t good for me too long because I’m terrified of being lonely. I hate being lonely and need someone to be able to share ideas with and comfort me but even when those aren’t happening I stay with them because I don’t want to risk having no one.

50,"I follow a big body positivity figure, in my country, on IG and she posted a link that she was teaming up with a news/TV station and making a program about learning to love your body and that they were looking for people wanting to participate.

I sent in the things that they needed; a little about myself, age/height/weight and a picture.

I didn't think much of it. Then I got an email that they had so many people wanting to be a part of it, that they needed me to submit a short video, talking about my relationship with my body, including (if I was comfortable with it) a full body shot/picture.   
I was very much not comfortable with it, so I just let the email sit in my inbox for a few days.

Then they called me. She was very sweet, the girl on the phone, saying that she was sorry for calling and she hoped it was okay, but they had specifically written down that they really wanted to hear more from me and if I still wanted to be a part of it. We had a brief chat and I decided that I would.

I went into my bathroom and shot a 01:54 minute video and it felt fucking horrible. It felt horrible, voicing how I felt about myself. How can a human being feel like this about their own body?

It's one thing when the thoughts are only in my head.. But verbally putting them out into the world. That was hard.

64,"Anxiety, stress, and depression can take the joy out of life. In a lot of cases, taking control over breath (read: paying attention to breath) can be so helpful in taking control of anxiety; especially social anxiety.

It’s so simple, yet such an underrated technique. If you get social anxiety then this technique is a must try. What’s there to lose anyway - the breath is yours. It’s not like you are paying for it :-)

Simply put, *lack of oxygen in brain causes not only anxiety, but also dizziness*.

I am sharing with you what works best for me. Here is some good content on the same subject. It’s probably explained in a little more detail here.

65,"I made a post here saying I might be possessed because there are things I've done that I don't remember. From placing stuff, to breaking up with my 2 year long boyfriend. I genuinely thought I have some type of amnesia or I'm going crazy. Turns out, it was Ashley.  She's the one conscious being in my brain that controlled my body for years without me being aware of it.  **Ashley Shane** is the name that I always carry around even in real life, but it's not my real name. My real name is **Shane Lei**. So hi, hello.  I've recently found out I have DID so I decided to name this unnamed identity after my alias; she preferred, and I believe she's really fond of that name since I haven't heard any complaints. I went to the psychiatrist (as recommended by reddit users) and I said I have a sleeping disorder. To which, they placed me in a room to be monitored, only to see that after a few hours into the night, I stood in one corner of the room, grabbed a pillow, dropped it, and completely changed my mannerisms. I reported that I didn't remember anything after that. 

That was when I met you, Ashley. That's when I've known you've lived alongside me without making me aware of your existence, and even gave me paranoia. Hi, hello. I didn't know anything about DID but the doctor said that I could hear you in my mind. The Doc talked about headspace, fronting, etc... some stuff I was new. I recently found out about your triggers. You control the body every time I get tired or sad, or angry and even only during the night. You are me and I am you. Please try to get along with me. Why did you break up with my boyfriend, which I really love? Well, I guess maybe you want me to constantly be sad so you could front more often? Please don't be selfish. Please wait a little longer. Some day, I'll tell everyone about you. Then we may coexist without you damaging my social life and without me interrupting your life. Hi, Ashley. Welcome to my life. You don't need to hide anymore; and please don't be the villain in my story. What you did the past year was very antagonizing towards me. I know you stalk reddit; so you'll see this. 

*Please write me back; reply (because I know you hate writing letters irl) or post again. I want to know your story. I want to get to know you; not as an antagonistic alter ego, but as the other me.*

68,"It's odd how I have to hide these facts or be forced to argue about them as if I had just claimed that unicorns exist and had to prove it, as if confronting the fact that the world isn't rose colored were too much to handle for some. Walk around eggshells when the topic is mentioned,""how comes you've never had a relationship when you're 31?"" ""Not even a fling? Nothing?""
No, nothing, because nobody could ever have a thing for me. Why do I have to hide it? I'm unlikeable, I'm just diving straight into the facts.

My repelling power started early, when my very limited social contact as a toddler led to me have huge problems making friends, and continued thorough life, with highschool friends who didn't contact me at all after moving, and only gave me a call to meet once just to shame me out of nowhere right after exchanging greetings for the first time in years because they never really valued me.
So I moved at 14 losing those ""friends"" but tried my best to make new ones, but I was too weird. Normal teenage stuff, you say? But it continued on and on throught the years until I wasn't trying to get close to people anymore because it wasn't working. They'd all end up mocking me or just barely tolerating me.

So more time went by, I ignored people as much as they ignored me until at some point I decided to give dating a try and the pattern repeated. Yeah some people wanted to have sex but their interest stopped right there. I was still pushed aside as a person, only acknowledged as a sexual toy for whichever dude I had decided to give a opportunity at the time. The story has been the same three decades straight. I try to let people in only to be shoved aside, mocked or used. 

Yet I am expected to believe that despite the amount of evidence pointing against it, someone could like me. That I could be an important part of their world. That they'd actually want to spend time with me and maybe even enjoy being with me outside of sex!? Yeah, no. Never happened, never will. Life isn't like that. There isn't a prince charming just ready to brush aside everything that's made everyone disregard me in the past. Cupid's cult wants to desperately believe that the world is beautiful and that everyone has their happy ever after story, and it gets tiring never to be able to speak your mind. That not really, not everyone is attractive and not really, not everyone finds themselves happily in love.

It's not a low self-esteem either, it's a rational conclussion after years of experience. It shouldn't be met with the weakest counter argument known to humankind ""Oh there's someone for sure"" or the ever blaming ""self-fullfillinf prophecy"" garbage. I've left the door open into my world for anyone who'd like to wander in but everyone just walks past it. Mayhaps what's inside is too dull to bother, I wouldn't know. What I do know, thought, is that nobody will ever love me.

Have a good day.",07May2019,0

It was a rainy day, I was working at the Ice cream shop with some 40 year old lady I've never seen before. Some dude payed with some lint as a 20 dollar bill. Chris (my boss) and I went to his apartment to get it back with no luck so I stole his and his room mates' mcdonalds they just bought. They went to some made up school I never heard of. They chased me around the city, I crushed the McDonald's when they got to me, they preceded to beat the shit out of thugs much bigger than them. I was impressed and frightened.

71,"A bit of context :

I am French Canadian and when I was 3 years old my family went on a trip to France. That day, we were in Paris.

While my mother does believe in paranormal, my father is really skeptical about this kind of weird stuff, and to this day he tells me there is no logic reason why it happened.

Story time.

We woke up at a pretty standard time that day (about 8am) and we chilled in the Hotel room for about an hour. Then, we wanted a good French traditional breakfast at a close-by Café. My parents ordered food and coffees. I was playful and happy in my stroller, hungry and ready to eat. Now, the coffees arrive before the rest of the food and the server places them at my reach. Now, bright 3 years old me had the brilliant idea to pull the coffees towards me until they tipped over the edge of the table and spilled all over my body. My parents, completely panicked, deliberately try to remove my clothes as quickly as possible when somehow I am still playful and happy. Lo and behold not only was I not burned, but the coffees were room temperature. When the adrenaline finally dropped, the server assured my parents the coffees were supposed to be boiling hot as he brought them to our table as soon as he was done making them. When I was finally as clean as could be on the spot, my parents reordered the same  coffees and sure enough when the server brought them to the table they were boiling hot.
- For clarification, the coffees were in a tray which allowed me to grab the edge of said tray and pull it towards me.

Sansa has had her entire family destroyed by southern squabbles and suddenly she’s petty for opposing Dany and wanting a free north? Hell, even Cersei was right to burn up the people who marched her naked through the streets of King’s Landing and had her enter the Red Keep as a bloody, nude mess.

Tangential - I think the only thing mad about Dany is that she wants the throne so badly she’s willing to go to war over it - but she hasn’t outlined a plan for what she would do for the *people* of Westeros. Immense bloodshed and death of innocents to feed your own royal ego, when people are already eating and living freely under Cersei? GTFOH.

Mom and Dad never really raised me until I was ready for the freedom. After much of my childhood being ruined from Dad always being drunk to deal with the grief of his father which led to long nights of being told to stay in my room until Mom was done working over night shift. Mom worked hard to fake a happy marriage, though I still remember being woke up several times by both parents telling me to pack a bag and we were leaving other said parent. After getting my first phone I was tired of never receiving attention, I turned to the internet. Finding fb groups of random things which led to sex groups, I was 10 years old and addicted to porn. Mom found out and thought the way to fix me was take all my things, left me in a room with out a door and only a mattress. I needed help not punishment. Fast forward to highschool, we moved 1000 miles away from everyone I had ever known. I went back to my old friend, this time easier with apps like instagram and snap popping up I made fake accounts with pretty girls pictures because I have never been beautiful like my sisters. I met a boy and fell head over heels only problem is i totally catfished him. I eventually told him and it was one of the hardest things i have ever done. After that was over i deleted all of her accounts and never wanted to be seen again. I tried to commit suicide and failed. Ended up in a rehab for 2 weeks.

80,"I met this beautiful girl who had eyes which captivated me during my college internship. She had a really cute smile and was really quiet most of the time. She’s an introvert so we didn’t talk much but I got her number. She really cute and lowkey, for a girl like her she has way too little followers on Instagram.

I started texting her like maybe a month ago and tried asking her out but she would just come up with excuses. So far it has been emotionally exhausting for me. I try to get closer to her by asking her out or texting her about her favourite things but she just gives dead replies and take quite a bit of time to reply. She invited me to her party twice but she was too busy to talk to me as she had other friends to entertain so I’d just sit in a corner.

I have no idea if she’s acting this way because she’s an introvert or because she’s not interested in me. I’ve never seen someone so beautiful before that I’m not willing to give up trying for her but I believe it has taken a toll on my school work.

Only my close friends know about her and they keep encouraging me to ask her out and all but I just don’t feel like she’s interested and slowly all the hype is just turning into disappointment. I really have no idea how I should continue from here, should I continue trying till she tells me no she’s not interested directly or should I just give up as there’s no hope since she’s not interested? 

This has made me really stressed out, I can’t sleep because she keeps popping up in my mind and I didn’t want to talk to my friends about this as I didn’t want to annoy them. I wrote this here hoping that I could relief some stress that has been bottling up inside me.",07May2019,2

I live somewhere with a crumbling economy, so goods, products, anything really has gotten 5-10 times more expensive in the span of less than a year. Minimum wage is 100$, just as a point of reference. The cheapest piano is worth 11 times minimum wage. So you're gonna have to save up your entire year's salary to buy one, but wait, the prices are going up exponentially - so you'll probably (like, almost for sure) won't be able to afford it by then.

92,"I'm 19F who's friends with 24M (we'll call V) and 29M (we'll call D). We became friends about seven years ago through a MLP group that 29M started, I and 24M were moderators in the group. These men are the closest people in my life beside my boyfriend who is 19M, they have been with me through heartbreaks, sick family, and just general struggles with growing up. I consider them both my brothers because of how close we are, V and D don't talk as much as they used to but I keep in great contact with them.

Over the years D has gotten close to me, more so than V, V has been telling me that D was interested in me for a while now which I've ignored due to being with my current boyfriend. This past week especially I became suspicious of D's intentions due to my roommate pointing out subtle flirting so I asked V for advice, which is a whole other story, V told me D was interested in me and he's now showing his true feelings since I'm now legal. V then expressed his own interest in me. Knowing V, I considered his interest a joke and kept talking to him about D since I was going to meet them this winter (neither of them knew of this, I was going to surprise them; obviously taking BF or roommate for protection in case they weren't who they say they were)

Two days ago, I asked V why I was so attractive to him and he mentioned that I was sexually attractive to him despite him having a girlfriend (23/24F) of three or so years. He then goes on to mention that we could have a threesome with D and him and I hooking up alone. When I asked about his girlfriend he said I was worth the risk and that he wanted to have rough sex with me. After this, he texted my briefly and hasn't responded/opened any messages I sent him.

Today, I texted D about what V said, which he then got cold towards me, acting irritated and told me to ignore his advances and V will ultimately apologize for what was said. This made me more suspicious since D acted jealous despite him telling me he didn't like me (I brought up what V said earlier about D liking me as well as the sexual advance.) I believe D when he tells me he doesn't have interest in me because we're too close and he knows I'm with someone and respects that, V and other friends of mine don't believe it though, but again I ignore it.

My boyfriend knows about both of them and how close I am to them but not about the sexual advance V made or evidence that D might have interest in me.

I don't understand why they have changed all of a sudden? I've been legal for a bit, they even celebrated my 18th with me so why make advances now? I need advice on how to go about this, I don't want to lose my two friends over this, I just want to go back to how things were before this week. I know I shouldn't have made friends with such a huge age gap and I'm naive for doing so but I can't bond well with people my age and do better with older people, plus I was younger and more ignorant when I met them. I don't know what to do. I'm open to any replies.

TL;DR:

My two friends of six/seven years are acting strange around me since one of them (V) made sexual advances towards me despite him believing the other (D) has an interest for me which D claims he doesn't and I believe him. How do I go from here and not ruin my relationship with the two closest guys I know who I consider my brothers?",07May2019,2

However, your partner gives you their everything. Your nothing is replaced. Balance is achieved, etc. 

That was our relationship. I was the person who said monogamy is a social construct, isn’t worth it, etc. Oh but did my perception change. My years of depression and womanizing and listless hope found their end. Oh my she brought out the best in me. I realized that this is the life I wanted to live.

My mom just told me the bank called and denied the loan. All because of missed payments on a van almost 10 years ago. They’ve been working so hard on their credit and doing everything they can to build it up, but it still didn’t work out. 

If anybody deserves a home, it’s my parents. They haven’t owned their own home ever, to my knowledge. They’ve raised 4 kids, and been so poor for so long. 

It’s just not fair...I feel like I’ve been punched in the gut. I was so hopeful that things would finally work out for them. (And also for us.) 

Ugh. This situation sucks.",07May2019,1

Everyone needs help, having someone to talk to and discuss things you’re going through is great, so i’ll be that person! Talk to me, say anything, i’ll reply!",07May2019,6
103,"I'm not saying this in an edgy, aggressive or holier-than-thou way, but I have realized that I genuinely do not and as much as  I try can not feel any emotional response to human beings whatsoever. I don't get joy, I don't get upset and I don't get mad.

&amp;#x200B;

Take my upstairs neighbors. They make an insane amount of noise that disturbs my daily life. I've recently resorted to banging on the ceiling when they're being rowdy and for the first time the other day, the tenant came down to yell at me for it. I prepped myself to be angry, upset, scared anything but the second I opened the door, it was like a switch flipping. It was like my emotions just switched right off. I wasn't mad at him. I felt no malice or fear, I felt no empathy for his situation, I felt no desire for brotherhood or anything. The noise from upstairs annoys me, but seeing the individual involved gave me nothing at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Another example, I recently ""fell out"" with a close friend of several years. I've supported this friend through a lot of emotional trials by being a shoulder for them to cry on. They always commented that I was so neutral and that it helped them deal with it. Anyway, recently for whatever reason, we ""fell out"" and they sent me a long email detailing exactly what I did ""wrong"". The details are irrelevant, but even though I'd call this person my best friend, I felt nothing. Absolutely nothing. No pain, no regret, no happiness or anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

Getting darker- I feel nothing when presented with the image of starving children. I felt nothing when my grandfather passed away. I feel nothing about my grandma in a care home with Alzheimer's.

&amp;#x200B;

I am also aware that I have a non-existent sex drive for people. It has been a big strain on relationships which to be honest I've given up on (and am completely fine with that).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not bottling it up because I soul search and meditate and come up with the overall opinion that I just plainly have no emotion for human beings. It's extremely odd to me and I'm not sure how to interact with people lately because of my absolute, overwhelming indifference. Even forcing myself to show a faux reaction is a trial. I'm known as the level-headed one in the family but they are not aware of the absolute and conquering indifference I feel toward everyone; friends, family or otherwise.

&amp;#x200B;

On the contrary, I consider myself a \*deeply\* emotional person. I am a happy person and quite upbeat about life and my circumstances. I am moved to tears by the mere sight of a sweeping countryside, or a bright blue sky with white fluffy clouds and the feeling of sunshine on my face. I enjoy long, steamy baths on a spiritual level. I will make a coffee when it rains and sit next to my open Juliette balcony just for the good feelings it gives me. I lose my shit when I see a cute dog on the street. I get endless joy from delicious food. Even sexually, I find my only stimulants are animated pieces of a less typical variety. When I'm sad, I cry buckets and even about small things like spilling a drink or dropping a glass. When I hurt myself, I feel a lot of emotional pain too.

&amp;#x200B;

It's very odd to me. I suppose I'm just confused about it and wanted to type it out. I feel like my emotions were all dumped into things people consider ""normal"" and unexciting and just left my empathy and synergy with humans completely empty. I'm not sad about it. I just... observe it.",07May2019,4
104,"I keep getting drawn to ""sad"" subreddits and want to complain about random things that bother me. Also I almost exclusively listen to sad music. It almost feels like I am trying my best not to become a more happy person haha. Anybody else feels the same?",07May2019,9
105,"I don't know where else to post this, because I just want to share happy thoughts about this part of my life. Attention, I'm not asking for any advice, just sharing.

When I hear/read stories about young people dating, especially those who entered they first relationship, most are narrowed down to those descriptions of awkwardness, gibberish talk, deep anxiety and fears, basically, a general sense of ""unnaturalness""? As if something isn't adding up, even if the couple likes eachother and is willing to enter their relationship.

Things between me and my boyfriend went very differently, almost 4 years ago. Firstly, beyond being my boyfriend, he is my best friend, and that's one of the favorite things I have about us. When we started dating, it simply lined up so smoothly, so naturally. It was so soothing, and I felt (and still feel) so at peace with that occurrence. Typically, there's always that ""asking out"" day, in which one of the two people expressely ask ""Do you wanna be my partner?"". In my case, that didn't even need to happen. The closest thing I can describe is him sending me a small folded paper, amidst our philosophy class, in which he wrote that he liked me as more than a friend, but that's it. No questions, no major anxieties and fears. From that day onward, we started to get even closer and more physically intimate, but still hanging out normally and doing our own stuff. Then, a few days later, as we were just hanging out in the park, during our last day of school, we start to hug and stare deeply into eachother's eyes. We both knew what the other wanted, there was no need for verbal communication there, because that moment felt like we were part of the same entity, like a fusion. We slowly and gently kisses me on the lips, just after I'd kissed his cheek, just as gently. And that was basically it, no regrets and no doubts after that.

Both of us had had their first kiss that morning, that's basically the reason why we defined that day as our anniversary. Deep down, we already knew that our souls had been tied together long before that day (I'm not talking about destiny, attention!).

As I said, it just felt so peaceful and right, not even today, almost 4 years later, I regret this. I just feel so thankful for him and for the person he is, I love him so much and I love our behavior as a couple. For sure, one of the words that can be used to sum up us as a couple it's really the one I've been using quite often on this text: natural. We can just be ourselves around eachother. We're best friends, lovers and soulmates, and I wouldn't trade him for any other guy!

That's all I wanted to share!",07May2019,8
106,"My boyfriend and I are trying to get on track to being healthier. We started running yesterday and we were only able to jog for a few minutes before getting insanely tired. I would say we in total jogged for 10 minutes and walked for 20. 

I want to be proud of myself for going out there and doing something, but at the same time I felt so ashamed that I couldn’t even run for a full hour. Did anybody else start like this? I really hope to see improvement soon.",07May2019,1

109,"I absolutely love the way I look and my personality, and I don't feel self conscious about my fashion sense, music taste, talents, etc. I have my faults in all of those areas, of course, but from my perspective, that makes me seem better. Despite being in love with myself in such a manner, I still seek validation from others. As in, why doesn't anybody love me the way I love myself? I'm getting tired of it because the people around me obviously don't see me the way I see myself and frankly don't really care that much about what makes me 'me'. That's understandable and I don't blame them. I just wish I'd stop seeking that love from other people lol. I know this may be a human instinct, but I have a caring family that is open about expressing love and I have plenty of other sources of happiness in my life that should satisfy this habit. Any advice? I'd love to fully eliminate this desire if possible.",07May2019,1

I've had this thought so many times, so I have to share it. 

Summertime false flag of massive proportions (making 9/11 a blip), followed by ""cannot change in power during a war of this magnitude,"" and a cancelled election. 

Possibly a minor insurrection followed by intense military response, fueled by racism and Jesus, tenfold what it was after 9/11. Also likely, dirty nuclear on American soil: CA, WA, TX.

114,"Well banks, here i am. I screwed up this whole thing with you and m pretty sure you are distancing yourself at this point. If your reading this, then you either got reddit and sought me out ( which wouldt be hard) or im outta highschool. You were always the one. I never had a doubt in my mind that you were going to be the one that i spent my life with. I may not have made it clear to myself at first (ie, the philly trip), but that night in philly... i lied to you and now im suffering the consequences. I told you that i liked jas. Which, in all honesty, i did. She was my type. But what i didnt tell you was that i was struggling with who i really did like. Ever since you walked in that hall at school and i called you the new girl, i knew. I couldnt let you in. I acted like a jerk, i put up walls, and i tried shoving you away. But you wouldnt leave. You just wouldnt. So in philly, i spent a good twenty minutes thinking about how to answer that. You liked chance, and i knew that i couldnt of interfered with your feelings. Every time i did, you said that you still liked him. No matter how hard i tried, you would not persuaded that he was going to wreck your life. I knew, that somewhere in the back of my head, i liked you more than jas. I knew it. And saying that i liked her instead of you turned my world upside down. Ive always regretted those last two months of eight grade. So this is me telling you that no matter what you do, no matter where you go, i wull always be waiting here for you. You will always have a shoulder to cry on, a person to talk to, and friend (hopefully more than that at some point) to be there for you. 

So Tyra Banks, im admitting in my most vulnerable time that i truly.... no. Not love. Those three words are said to much, to quote snow patrols chasing cars. But i hope you understand that i couldnt lead jas on anymore. That i couldnt truly be true to her with you still in my life. I never ment to have it end up this way, with you leaving me behind until i ""stop acting so weird"". That hirt me, but i strengthened me to new levels. Im constantly praying that you will get through this dark time of your life, where you have no one to turn to. I fantasize that i will end up like will in the end of GoodWill hunting, but uts a movie. Not reality.

If you find this, let me know. Its killing me to not be able to talk to you. I know im blocked, because you still gave isaac emilys number. You say im not, but i am. If you do read this, tell me how you take it. Even if we never work out together, i still will be there for you.
