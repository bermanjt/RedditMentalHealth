I'm luckier than many others in life I guess

4,"Sorry if this is in the wrong thread. Wasn’t exactly sure where to put this I just wanted to say it. 

We’ve (22F and 24M) have only been dating for 5 months and I know I’m just in the honeymoon phase. 

But I wish I was sleeping next to him every night. I have plenty of good friends and I know I should just get out with them more and be an independent person. But I never get tired of being around him and being around him calms all the anxious thoughts I have on repeat in my head. 

I actively try to not come off as clingy to him and I think so far I’m doing well! But man I can’t wait to move in with him...",09May2019,1
5,"I’m sure versions have been made but I’ve never seen one. People could do things like obviously sniffing butts, start maniacally yelling at other people just because they seek them.

6,"As the title says, I just finished my last final exam of community college. For some context, I am a 21 year old guy and have been very fortunate to have landed a job a year ago that is in my field. But right now I feel sick to my stomach and am just beyond upset. School had been such a blessing in my life and I love it when all my heart. But now I'm done. It's over. Learning just became a luxury at the drop of a pencil and now I don't know what to do. I recent moved up in my job from something that I love to something I thought I would love but has actually been stressing me out almost from day one three months ago. So obviously that doesn't help one bit. And to top it all off, the one person I want to thank for getting me where I am now, actually pushing me, and for showing me that I can be better doesn't want to talk to me. A massive wave of emotion just hit me and to be honest I feel just a little lost. 


I'm not really sure how to end this considering I've never done this before and I don't see any rules so....

 another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away.

12,"Last year I left a job I didn't like for an internal transfer to another job.  I left a city I liked with friends, an apartment with room mates I got along with and had fun with, and the area that my family is from to move to a different city for this job about 2 hours away.  I really felt I needed to change things up and I thought the move might be fun.

I've lived here 7 months and hate it.  It just isn't working.  I'm miserable and lonely here and travel back home to visit friends every weekend I can.  I've talked to my manager and explained the situation, I am looking for new jobs back in the old city with her support.  I've applied to 2 jobs, didnt hear from one after like 3 weeks and just got a rejection from the other.

Even though I hated my old job, I hate my new life.  I want to stay with this company because the benefits are great and finding the right fit here could be great for me long term, but man I wish I just stayed.  Who knows how long itll take for me to find a new job in the old city.  I honestly think living here is harming my mental health and part of me feels like even if I do go back I'm just never going to be the same again after feeling this way so consistently for so long.",09May2019,2

20,"I think I’ve written this a thousand times by now in my own journal or somewhere else. I just... I don’t know where else to write it really. I don’t know what else to do. 

I’ve been out of the military for almost two years now. For the longest time ever, I loathed my time in the service. A lot of bad stuff happened, but I always tried to tough through it. I did what I had to do. But, it always bothered me. It always made me feel like shit deep down. 

When I got out, I went straight to school. To college. What I’ve been looking forward for a while and I just felt so... disconnected. I tried to make friends but I’ve found myself in a place where I’m socially just cut off from everyone else. I feel so... alienated. So sad all the time. I don’t really know if it’s depression but... I don’t know. 

The other veterans at the military office don’t really care to help out. If you’re not there for something GI Bill related then you’re wasting their time. Or at least... that’s how it’s felt. I leave them be because I don’t want to be a bother to them. I don’t want to go somewhere where I’d be a nuisance. 

Man... I try so hard to befriend others too but I find it so hard to find good friends and to keep them. I made some really good friends in some semesters but then never speak to them again when the semester ends. I try to reach out to them but I get nothing but silence or the usual “I’m busy”. And... Well, I just leave them be. 

My only joy is being home with my wife and dog. They bring me so much happiness. But, I can’t help but feel like I’m such a burden to her. She works hard every single day and I try to make use of myself during the time where I’m not at school. We’re trying to have a child but we’ve been trying for over a year now and I can feel that sadness just clouding her every time another month passes, another period starts, and still nothing. We had an early miscarriage late last summer and I cried only once she had fallen asleep. I feel like it’s my fault that we haven’t had luck. 

I just feel like shit. 

I try to identify with people, try and be the best person I could be for everyone and it never works out. 

If it wasn’t for her... I don’t know. It’s just a lot to bear some days. I dread every night because I know I’ll have trouble sleeping. 

Thanks for reading if you got this far. Sorry if it was all just crap... I just don’t know where else to write it.",09May2019,5
21,"Growing up I would always tell my friends I love them and convince myself romantic partners are lovable just the same. I would assume if they love me for my flaws I can look past theirs and that is love. It’s not though. I’m with someone who genuinely feels like home when I’m around them. I’ve shown the most repulsive sides of myself and at no point have I ever felt the suggestion of loathing. Just love really. We quarrel rarely but when something is said that doesn’t sit right in our gut we talk about it until we can get past it. It’s never ended on a bad note. We keep playing good ones. And that’s how everyday seems lately. I want to make sure she never has to work another day in her life. I want her to live the most happy and peace filled existence any woman on this earth would hope for. I have dreams of my own and they have slowly been realized since I have met her. What I’m saying is if she can convince me that love, true genuine love is real than any silly little dream of mine can be as well. Lib my love one day I’ll read this to you so you can be assured that my intent now is the same as it is as I write this expose to the world. The best thing I had ever done for myself is you babe. I want anyone who reads this to know that I hope one day your cynical selfish punk ass life will be smacked in the face with your own Lib. She becomes half your whole, and good thing too because your whole before was just a hole. I don’t care for the circumstances of my birth nor the truth of the afterlife. I care about now and how when I wake up every day i spend a considerable amount of time figuring how I’m going to make your day worthwhile. How you’ll look at me with those big blue eyes behind a curtain of sexy lashes that are only rivaled by your million dollar smile. How my eyes take in the picture of your face and warm the core of this overly attached dope of a man. I hope some genius figures out how to really make us live forever like I’ve been talking about. I finally have my reason. I love you Lib. 

P.S I figured out how I’m gonna pop the question. We’re a long ways away from that day, but I know just what to do to make you melt and I can’t wait to show you.

24,"Being a strongly opinionated 14-year-old girl, I obviously have a LOT of opinions and I am not afraid to voice the opinions. I love creating a good argument and arguing my opinion, I can argue the other opinion but it's just not as fun. I'm sure you're confused as to how this is going to fit into the title, but just you wait.

My opinions don't always... please people, to say the least. They are sorta underrated and unpopular opinions. One of them being 'Stranger Things' is overrated in my opinion. But anyway, there was a particular day where I was talking to my boyfriend and we got into the topic of religion. I'm not Christian, nor am I any other religion. I just believe little parts of different religions. I find it hard to believe that there is some overseeing ruler in the sky that watches over us. I just can't believe that. Yes, people have written and talked about seeing heaven or hell and god or the devil and such but how can I know that they are just not making it up? The guy who wrote the bible could have been completely joking and nobody would know because they're dead. So where's the actual proof?

I believe in reincarnation, and I know people will always say that there is no proof, but yes, yes there is. Children smaller than the age of 6 have been known to talk about ""when they were older"" and other people in their lives when, in reality, those people didn't exist. My cousin, for example, used to be able to shine and lace shoelaces. On older shoes. She knew what to use and showed my great grandma how to do it. She was only 4 or 5 at the time. How would she have known how to do that? She was born in 1998. Where would she learn how to do that by the age of 4 in 2002? There's no way someone could have taught her. Nobody in our family didn't know how to. She used to scare my aunt by saying ""when  was older"" and things like that. Finally her mind forgot about it and she doesn't remember how to do any of that. Now explain to me how that would be so if nobody else knew how and we know that in 2002 there were no shows teaching todlers to shine and lace shoes. 

Also there are thousands of people who remember their past life. If you're thinking it's just kids vividly dreaming, then let me ask you something. Where did kids, who don't even know the alphabet, find out how to tie and shine shoes? Where did that ability come from? I'm jsut saying, not everything is based on logic and science or whatnot, I think that some things just don't have a reason, they simply are.",09May2019,0

30,"Oh snap guys, this is such a big deal for me! My three year old son has always been very curious about my extremely noticeable stretch marks (on my arms, my legs, my tummy, everywhere) and my bigger, squishy tummy. He’s always asking about them, poking my stomach (one time he grabbed my tummy and said, jiggy jiggy jiggy! I was not pleased haha) and just curious about why not all bodies are the same. I have always tried to be very body positive with him, trying not to say the words “I’m fat” in front of him even though at the time I truly believed it, believed that I was not desirable because I had gained so much weight. I would always answer his questions like, stretch marks happen when you gain weight fairly quickly but they’re not bad, just something your body does. Or, bodies are always changing and sometimes our bodies carry more fat than at other times, but that doesn’t mean that it’s good or bad, it’s our special body no matter what it looks like. And finally, no matter what your body looks like you are a special, unique individual that is worth so much and no one can tell you otherwise.
So I think all that body positivity talk rubbed off on me because today, for the first time in over two years, I looked at myself naked in the mirror and wasn’t disgusted. I found myself not minding my stretch marks, not poking at my tummy, wishing it were smaller, and, this is where the break through comes, I even found myself a little attractive. Heaven forbid and hold the phone folks! I haven’t felt that good about myself in years, let alone considered myself attractive. I am so happy! I just wanted to share because this is huge for me. Yay for body positivity!",09May2019,82
31,"I’ve been up for 60 hrs straight on continuous low doses of adderall. It started as a “I need this to stay up to study and I’m only doing this bc it’s an absolute emergency,” as I have done before with no problem, but now here I am with my heart pounding out of my chest. I don’t know what to do - I took another small dose just now without even thinking (which speaks volumes on how sleep deprived I am) and now I feel like I’m stuck staying up for yet another night. Granted, I have to study for one last midterm, but I don’t even feel energized anymore. I just feel weird. 

I could stay up, try to study, maybe get a quick 1 hour snooze in before my exam at 8:30. Or I could try and sleep a bit, since I’m tired enough that I’m even sleepy on adderall (I haven’t felt tired this whole time until now), and wake up early to study. 

Option 2 sounds better for my health (marginally..), but I’m afraid of falling into such a deep sleep that I miss all my alarms and sleep through my exams and work. I also don’t want to set a 4/5 am alarm because I have a roommate, plus only 5 hours to study would cut it real close. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m scared to stay up and go crazy and do some kinda damage to my health. I’m scared to go to bed and miss my alarms and exam and work. I’m scared regardless of what I do because I know that I have exam/work/class until 9:30 pm tomorrow, then I have work the next day, then I have a full day class on Saturday after which I am seeing my family for Mother’s Day. All while I’m crashing from the biggest adderall binge I’ve ever done. I’ve only ever taken 10 at a time once every few months, and now I’ve consumed 120 mg in what, 3 days? I’ve lost count. AND on top of all that, I have to be getting more work done, or else I’ll find myself exactly where I was this Monday. 

I’m also mad at myself for putting myself in this situation. I just made a bunch of stupid/selfish/etc choices from 2 weeks ago until now that have led to me needing to cram for exams, write papers, find an apartment, handle misc extra curricular stuff, maintain an okay outward appearance to my helicopter mom who would MURDER me if she found out the predicament I’m in. Oh yea, and I don’t have food or clean clothes because I haven’t had even a minute to think about groceries and laundry. 

I’ll take it all as a blessing in disguise - I knew I had to be careful with addy and when I took to for the first time I instantly saw myself getting hooked on it. Until now I’ve been good about it, but I was always curious about taking twice my normal dose or using it to party instead of study. Fuck, I don’t wanna live like this. 

I’m just hoping I make it until tomorrow night when I can finally get a semi normal sleep. Until then though, I’m absolutely terrified.",09May2019,1

33,"It’s excruciatingly painful from both an emotional and deeply-soul perspective to face the depressing truth and stark realization that I’m still living at home, with what seems an insurmountable stockpile of debt which is utterly nonsensical and glaringly beyond comprehension. My 18yr old self would be aghast at such horror if you’d mention that over a decade later he’d be cashless, womanless, and deeply indebted, since this is indeed the existential experience that I continuously endure, with a physical angst that pervades and coarses relentlessly through each crevice of my being. Now let's examine the inevitable lonely truth that the physical experience of inhabiting our body is inherently a solitary one, and a confounding mystery to any outside observer, which leads to a depressing conclusion that our private existential reality and the manner in which present circumstances emotionally affect us will ultimately be a private black-box that is ostensibly concealed from the purview of others, and thereby contributing to a continual feeling of being misunderstood, feeling alone, unless one can successfully use colloquial language to effectively articulate subjective experience, but language is limited. This leads to the subsequent acknowledgement that we must therefore embrace, fully, radically and unapologetically this intrinsic “I”, which signifies our real deep inner truth, since nobody will ever reside or experience the unique existence of our life. Hence we must constantly strive to unconditionally become our own best friend as again nobody shall ever walk, see, and experience the world quite like we do. And again, via the use of language and enunciations we can ofcourse try to express emotions in efforts to vividly depict and describe our present reality, but the visceral day-to-day experience of angst-ridden dread that is typical of INFP's is only internalized by you and only you, and so our life journey is ultimately a solitary one. In 16 days I will be entering 35 and to say that it doesn’t affect me would be a gross understatement. The psychic anguish of knowing full-well that I’m not living my best life continues to haunt me, and perhaps will be a sign of regret for years to come. I wish I had the financial resources that I once had before letting it sift through my fingers. I tinkered way too long in the unenviable state of limbo and consequently dwindled the only savings I ever knew to a point of near brokeness and deprivation. The stress-ridden body that I live within is engulfed in flames of fear, listlessness, and confusion. I know the “I"" deep-within me, the powerful soul that resides inside is screaming for connection and yearning for love, meaning, and contentment but yet is fed nothing but loneliness, angst, and lonesomeness. I often ponder why I repeatedly get myself stuck in the same broke situations and instability, a groundhog days of sorts, and the inevitable conclusion that I surmise is because I dislike myself deep-down and feel undeserving of the good life that I conversely deeply desire and yearn.

​

Alas It’s an inherent disconnect between the conscious and subconsicious which manifests itself as the eternal real-life struggle of my life. All I ever wanted was to play and be played with, to sing and be sung to, and just experience the curious wonders of the world while holding the hands and gazing into the eyes of a lover, a lover that understands without need for flattering words or facial expressions that indeed you are special human being with a profound depth of intellect, love and compassion, recognizing that such qualities are unfortunately burrowed deep inside your core, but it’s there, and it shines like a flickering flame, bursting at the seams to let loose. The reality is that this ""letting loose"" process might require years or a prolonged duration until one truly unravels the onion and deepest layers of the soul. Or perhaps a daily meditation practice can help. 

Anything is possible.

36,"I'm desperately hurting and I don't know where else to go. Wild ride ahead. tldr: Ex who I had a super solid relationship with enters a depressive episode, cuts off all her friends, posts our old pictures and now is literally dating another me.

8 months ago we had our 2 year anniversary. We talked about how we wanted to be that old couple over there going for walks in the park together after all those years. She referred to our future kids as 'little baby {my name}s would be so cute, can you imagine???'. 3 weeks later she told me she was so happy to have me, couldn't believe it was over 2 years. The next week she told me her depression was getting worse. The next week she left because we just 'weren't a good match' and she couldn't explain it but she just had to leave. In the background, she had just quit the job she had had for 5 years, gotten an $800 speeding ticket, and was coming up on graduation with no job lined up for afterwards. Her depression also manifested itself as self-isolation (her words when we started dating). Clearly all the makings for a good depressive episode, acknowledgement she was getting more depressed, and then the eventual self-isolation.

After that day she stopped talking to all our mutual friends, friends she'd known since she was 5. I assumed it was because I was friends too, so it was awkward for her. I assumed she kept up with her other friends. We went no contact. I spend 6 months or so waking up and feeling her absence every day. I wake up and she's not there. Shower and think about how we possibly broke up, how she could POSSIBLY change her mind that quickly. go to work, come back and she's not there. Every party, event, I felt her, like a hole I've never had with my other ex's. Last week I was at a party and this girl was flirting super hard, following me around the party, and all I could think of was how much my ex would enjoy the bonfire and how much I wanted to share it with her. I guess in the back of my mind I always thought she'd come back. Everyone else thought so too apparently, they just didn't tell me in case, well, this happened. I thought maybe once her life settled down and she got her depression under control, she'd come back. We were so happy, perfect for each other, how could she not?

Until today, when I learned that she's dating someone. I couldn't resist and facebook stalked a little, and holy fuck he's literally me. I sent a picture to my sister and she actually thought I sent a picture of me. And not only does he LOOK like me, he basically does the same shit. I'm an Eagle scout, this guy is outdoorsy and hunts and stuff. I'm big into motorcycles, this guy rides too.

It gets worse. I couldn't resist and looked back a little bit and in February she posted some of our old relationship pictures, ones that I TOOK ON OUR DATES. Later that month she's posting pictures of her other friends, pictures from YEARS ago (it's her bathroom from her old house, same street but different house) with the text 'miss you guys!'. Clearly she's cut them out of her life, too, so not just mutual friends. March her mother is posting anti-depression motivational 'youll get through this' images on her wall. April she's now dating my literal clone.

She's super obviously not over me, and I'm DEFINITELY not over her considering I've done nothing but cry for 4 hours. I told her when she left that I loved her and I wished her the best, and that if she ever came to regret it that she should message me, because I KNEW she would. She clearly does and is trying to replicate her old life but is probably still in the middle of this episode.

I don't know what to do, I really honestly thought she'd come back when she figured it out. Everyone did. when she left she literally told me she didn't know she was going to do it until she woke up that morning. 'I love you but I can't do this anymore. I know we never fight, and I recognize your strong support of my body issues, my mental health issues and my work. But we're just not a good match.'

I don't know what I'm looking for here I'm just really not doing well and I just don't know what to do. I don't blame her for freaking out in the first place, and I wanted her back and would have happily forgiven her, graduation/work change/etc. is enough to make a normal person uncertain and lose their shit, let alone a depressive one. But instead of coming back she decided to try to get back to where she was by dating my clone. Yeah well no fucken way that guy's gonna brush your hair before bed, it will NOT be the same.

38,"A couple of hours ago I took off my tshirt and swapped it with a hoodie. After awhile I noticed what I assumed was a bead of sweat on my left side. Background, I've always felt like beads of sweat were bugs. I typically get paranoid whenever I'm sweating that there's something crawling down on me. But I had my heater on and was generally hot so I DIDNT THINK ANYTHING OF IT THE ONE TIME IT MATTERED. 

Every once in awhile I would feel the persistent sweat on that one spot and be annoyed. After giving in and turning the heat off, I could still feel the sweat! I Stuck my hand down my hoodie to swipe it off, and when I glanced at it, there was a fucking centipede. 

Granted, it wasn't large, about 1 inch long give or take, I didn't even feel it on my hand. Fling it off maniacally and that bastard lands on the blanket my grandma JUST knitted for me. Grab that sucker having to be extra careful not to squeeze and get bug guts on my most prized possession. Made sure to squeeze it real hard in the napkin once I had it in my hand though, fucker.

44,"Throwaway account.

I honestly have nowhere else to put this and just want help if I'm being honest.

I seriously think I'm going insane or something happened in my brain to make me start thinking a different way. I have intrusive, fucked up, graphic, disgusting thoughts all the fucking time. I am fairly privileged so this has kind of come out of left field in the past year or two.

For one, I think we can establish I'm very depressed. I think about suicide and death often. I sometimes imagine what I would look like if I was dead in different situations. It intrigues me but to a certain extent worries me too. I find death fascinating and I never did before I was 18/19. 


I abuse and kill animals. I don't know why. This would have made me extremely sad if I were younger, I would have never been able to imagine myself committing such acts. But one night I came home after a night partying. I saw a sleeping rabbit on my front lawn so I went inside and got a butterfly net to catch it. It struggled and tried to escape and scratched me. Something about this sparked a rage I have never felt before so I just strangled it until it went limp. At first I was afraid I killed it but eventually it started breathing again. I was amazed how this seemed to blur the line between life and death so I kept strangulating the rabbit over and over until it actually died. And I did this probably 7 more times. I actually got excited when I saw a rabbit on my lawn because I loved feeling my blood pump through my heart and the way the adrenaline flowed into my fingertips as I would beat and strangle the rabbit.

But after some time this stopped, and I thought maybe I would be getting better. But I got much worse because I started abusing a dog too. I wont detail who's dog it was or anything but I abused it relentlessly and frankly it gave me a kind of high I haven't ever experienced. I have never killed a dog but abusing this single dog gave me so much pleasure it was unreal. 

And now, looking back after a lot of self reflection, I don't know how I live with myself but I do. If I was 16 and saw myself doing this in the future I would probably break down. Something fucking happened to me and I don't know what. My brain feels like it is hardwired differently now. I know that I am a very, very fucked up person but this is my best kept secret and I appear to everyone about as normal as you can get. 

I don't know why it had to be me. I always thought I would be normal but now I have this torment I have to live with. I know that I like killing and hurting things and it bothers me on a certain level. I'm beginning to think a traumatic event happened to me and I have repressed it or something.

So I’ve had this problem for as long as I can remember, but lately it’s gotten worse. I can’t shut my brain off. I’m constantly thinking about something and most of the time it’s not even on purpose. I try to just not think about anything, or concentrate on what I’m doing, but in the back of my head there are like open 10 tabs  on an internet explorer, all active at the same time. It’s like a constant buzzing, that just never stops. I’m one of those people, that finds it hard to vizualise my thoughts so I have to “speak them out” in my head, so when I’m thinking about something, most of the time it’s like someone is having a conversation in my mind...but only there are around 10 conversations going on at the same time.. and nothing really helps. I can’t switch it off. As you can imagine it is very tiring. That by itself is not a big deal, but I also have anxiety and panic attacks, so when my brain overloads, I start having the attacks more frequently, they last longer or I just feel sick all the time.. and sometimes even faint. The only time I get some peace is when my brain just goes blank. I could be riding the bus, or driving my car, or having a conversation with someone and I my brain just shuts off. It’s like I’m unconcious, but I’m still awake? If that makes any sense.. so when I get “pulled away” from the real world and then come back, I’ve missed a couple of minutes of my life. If I’m in the bus, I usually need a minute or two to remember where I was going, or if I was talking to someone, I heard nothing of the conversation, so I don’t know what’s going on. Even when sleeping I have vivid dreams, or these really intusive thoughts, that make me feel like I’m going crazy. I’m really forgetful and can’t remember the 2 things that I have to buy from the store..and many more. 
I’m just tired and want to help myself so I can be a normal person. Please, if you have some advice for me, I would love it if you could share it. Literally anything. Thank you and sorry for the long post. :)",09May2019,1

There is obviously a problem with me, but no one could tell me what it is. 

&amp;#x200B;

My theory is that I'm boring. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a pleaser, I like to be ""the perfect boyfriend"". I love to cook, so I cook. I like my appartment clean, so I clean. I'm the ideal feminist guy, and I'm proud about it. I make sacrifices, because I feel that's the right thing to do. I go all in for my relationship.

But I also feel I'm also not the ""only-live-for-his-girlfriend-guy"". I have many hobbies, big professional ambitions. 

&amp;#x200B;

I try to avoid conflict. When something is very wrong, I tell it. Otherwise, if it's not that bad, I might joke about it and move on. I despise useless arguments. I never ended a relationship on drama, it was mostly the girl who simply wanted to move on.

52,"I’m coming up on 2 years at my job and I’m still an associate. The latest person to get promoted has only been with the company for 6 months. I trained them to work with us, and now this person will be one of my bosses. 
My store manager has told me how important I am to the store, how having me around makes things go smoother because I’m a hard worker. It’s not as if I half-ass my job. 
I’m in my mid 20s and I’ve never progressed beyond entry level at any job I’ve ever had and I am so so tired.  This place in particular is rough on me because entry level pay and the raises that come after it are so much higher than minimum wage that leaving to go anywhere else would be a terrible idea. And the benefits package I have is great. No complaints there.
All of this is coming after I told my manager I would only be available to work morning shifts because I had gotten an evening job at a restaurant because my bills were consistently more than I make at the first job. 
So I feel like as soon as I told my boss my availability wasn’t open anymore, he went ahead and promoted someone else without even mentioning to me he was looking to promote somebody. And when job #2 starts (in the process of being built), I’ll be working 60 hours a week between both places. 
The person who got promoted is so nice. They work hard.  I have no ill will toward them. That’s what makes this so frustrating. I want to keep liking them.  I don’t understand what is so fundamentally wrong with me that I’ll never get any farther than entry level without working twice as hard.  I just want to be recognized. And I don’t want to look at yet another coworker who I enjoy working with and resent them for telling me what to do.

1.I am married but we do not have much in common and we do not share interests and I do not really care enough to try and go out of my way, especially because I think he feels good when he's alone;
2. Half a year ago I left my job because of health condition and because I basically was hating it, and have been doing literally nothing besides spending my husband's money; I have no idea what to do next and idea of waking up early every morning kills me. I regularly procrastinate;
3. A year ago I was exercising regularly and had lost 12 kgs, I actually could fit into my favorite clothes and was getting a lot of compliments; it did not last for long as for six months now I have been doing next to nothing but eating and hating myself when I wake up and feel my fat belly every damn morning;
I hate exercising as every time I'm in the middle of doing it I ask why I'm doing this to myself; so I avoid it every time I can cheat and tell myself I am not feeling this well so I can skip the gym;
4. I can easily excited about an idea of smth like a DIY project but then lose interest completely in the very beginning of doing it. I have become rather pessimistic about my own interests because of this. I think ""this too, will pass"";
5. I maintain food hygiene and have good skin and hair but still have difficulty looking at myself in the mirror - I just hate what I looks back at me;
6. At the same time I can be suddenly very arrogant and aggressive towards some people, even my family. Social awkwardness, overreacting, jumping to conclusions - I do all of these;
7. I noticed I cultivate hatred towards some kind of people around me and this hatred is not something I am consciously ready to get rid of. It's just that I enjoy ranting about them and really enjoy when others support me in this and rant with me;
8. I always complain. I like imagining the worst scenarios and I think that I just prepare for them but actually I mess myself up;
9. I am a regular liar though I have been forcing myself to not add new lies up to the old ones.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 18, I left college in the first week of 2018, I was taking an art/design class at a mid level difficulty, and after 4 months, of not really enjoying it, and finding it to be unachieving and below me (in the sense that I wanted to be someone, not just a guy that works, and it wasn't getting me anywhere to that) I, after taking a small walk around campus in a quiet area with trees, was listening to some music, (which was one of the other courses I was looking at when I was starting) and out of the blue said ''Fuck it, we're dropping out tomorrow and I'm going to follow my dreams to be a music artist''. That was it, the next day I didn't go in. My parents were a little shocked, but they were okay and supported the decision (well they accepted it, and just told me that I'm taking a risk, and tried to get me to go back for a day to talk with the college, but I didn't).

&amp;#x200B;

To start with I was attempting to become a nature photographer/ drawer. I wanted to make music, but I didn't really see it as a feasible option, as I had no experience making music or learning it whatsoever, I just enjoyed listening to it.

&amp;#x200B;

Then for a while I was slipping away into comfort, (mostly (i was still working for my goal a little) just playing video games, and doing nothing much, probably because I just needed time to clear my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

And then I started to look into music production, and learnt how to get started. \[SIDETRACK, i'm getting too detailed, so im going to sum it up with less detail\]. I then started to make stuff, and got better every week, and started to see it as a feasible path, and I still am, and I'm now almost at the point of being able to create an album.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where the posts title becomes relevant:

Music is something I love doing, what I'm good at, and I can be paid if I'm consistent and work hard.

&amp;#x200B;

But I feel that If I take that path, that I will not be doing something that the world needs, doing something that is easy to get paid for, leading me to a feeling of uselessness and unachievingness (thats no word!).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm worried that 5 years down the line, I may be financially independent, be somewhat satisfied, but also feeling like I haven't done enough, and haven't helped the world or achieved something inherently useful, other than for people who enjoy listening.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have some mental 'issues', that make it difficult for me to work around people, sometimes.",09May2019,4
91,"2 weeks ago I rented a Uhaul and left in the middle of the night and drove 20 hours away from the home my ex and I (and 2 roommates) moved into when things were good. I'd never felt like I had a family before living there. It took a few years to realize that family wasn't the people, it was just drugs, alcohol, and delusion. When I did the decent was quick, just a few days to lose everything. I spent a few months living in the basement, trying to avoid everyone while I saved money. A lot happened during that time that solidified the idea none of them ever really cared about me. I don't think they really care about each other either. 

The night I left though was different, it felt like it always had before things went downhill. Everyone was nice to me, I agreed to play a board game (we have lots of board game nights) and we all had fun together. It was like nothing had even happened. I left anyways, and spent most of that drive feeling like I'd made a mistake. No one has contacted me since, so I know now I made the right choice. That doesn't make me feel any better right now.

That eviction is holding us back and we don’t know what to do. We owe $4k to the old apartment (mostly for them having to clean out everything plus the rent the roommate wasn’t paying). We’re going to stay at a hotel but Idk what to do after that. The eviction cost has to be paid in full for it to be finished and off our record but we don’t have a lot of extra money.

95,"So this post isnt really ""extreme"" enough to be on raised by narcissists, I think, but because my mom has narc tendencies, I cant share this or even work things out with her. And I cant tell my friends because theyll think I'm being dramatic or otherwise discourage me.

I had been feeling really, extremely stuck in my life. I started a masters program I hated because my mom wanted me to, and ever since i dropped out my life has been a bit in free fall, but luckily I'm working on it. In the last 5 months I've rehauled my sleeping habits, taken up a new hobby, made great new friends, lost 20 pounds, etc etc etc. I feel the best I've felt in the last ten years. For everything except what I'm doing and going to be doing professionally.

I want to be a preschool teacher. It's really all I've ever wanted to do. My mom hates it because she devalues that work (imo) and doesnt think it makes enough money (on that point she is exactly right). I was forcing myself into a lot of different career paths to make her happy, but all I was getting out of it was anxiety and a bleak outlook on my life. Until I floated the idea of moving to another country to my therapist. And she told me to research it; really, she jumped on the idea, which gave me the courage to look into it myself. And this is the first time that a possible future outcome makes me... hopeful. I could be a preschool teacher by moving to a country that pays a living wage to preschool teachers.

So, I may be moving to another country to get a masters degree (to appease my mom) and find work as a preschool teacher (to appease me) and I feel strange about it because I cant tell anyone. I have to give myself permission to do this, because the idea of telling my parents scares the hell out of me, even though I know that its MY decision, not theirs. I have to give myself permission to do this, and to do this likely without their support. And that's scary, but I think might be the smartest and kindest thing I'll ever do for myself.",09May2019,3

Overreact to minute details that I search for to be upset about it seems like that after I calm down and talk myself back to reality and realize nothing is actually wrong nothing is actually happening that would be considered detrimental to bring up as a complaint or argument. Why do I do this??? Why do I get angry and “hot” anxiety that this is actually happening, that this story I’ve concocted is actually real. When it’s not real. I apologize after and he forgives me. He’s honestly the most amazing human I’ve met. So much to look up to and admire but most of all the man I get to love. I am so blessed. 
I smoke weed a lot and it helps me sleep. Also I use it throughout my day every day. I need help. It slows me down and makes me forget. I’m immature in some areas and over dramatic at times. Then get really depressed. Everyday there is some sign of my depression  but I live through it and make the best of who I am. Depression is not who I am. It will not run or ruin my life. It’s just something I have to work with and find the things that help relieve it. I’m happy but also depressed. Get it? I am also impulsive. Especially when it comes to buying things.

I’m the second oldest but I’ve always had the brunt of responsibilities because my older sister was a fuck up (not anymore but back when it mattered she was).  I was constantly forced to take care of my younger siblings at the expense of my mental health.  I barely got to see my dad and step mom my junior and senior year because my mom was so determined to keep me away from them so I could take care of my youngest brother.  I was still constantly walking on egg shells because no matter what I did, I wasn’t good enough for my step father and his opinion about me mattered so much to my mom.  I wasn’t girly enough, skinny enough, pretty enough, smart enough.  Even though I did a big leg of the raising of my younger sisters and brother, I still wasn’t good enough.  I could have been kicked out at anytime.

Now that I’m no use to them anymore, and I live far away, I hardly hear from them.  When I do visit them, they make a big show of dinner because “oh fitnesschickennugget is visiting!” but the reality is they don’t want me here other than that dinner.  They also ask me to do stuff for them even though I’m trying to see EVERYONE on this vacation, not just be stuck in one place because they need me for one thing.  I see my younger siblings living their best life because my parents finally have money to spend while I struggle.

I saw you in the corner of my eye as you were driving to go to the orange groves behind the neighborhood. You said in a super upbeat nervous tone “You look cute your body looks super tight!” This was totally out of character thing for you to say.  I turned and looked at you something was off but I couldn’t put my finger on it. So I said in a silly tone  “Thanks, Isaac!” He hated when I called him by his middle name. He shook his head and rolled his eyes he parked in the middle of the orange groves hidden from the road.  You turned on some weird boy band music you knew I hated but you didn’t care. I felt extremely nervous all of a sudden you leaned over and started kissing me I then realized what it was that made you seem so off you were drunk!  I felt paralyzed by your kiss now too scared to move. I don’t know why I thought it was a good idea to sneak out my brain was going a million miles per hour running through what should I do? I tried not to show that I was scared. He started unzipping my brown hoodie I said “no.” So softly that it was muffled by your breath and the radio.  You then started to undo my buttons on my jeans I said: “No David please NO!” Loud enough this time he sat back in his seat and goes “ Come, Lucy, why the fuck did you get in my car then?” your tone was harsh with jagged edge now. I looked at you confused I felt betrayal you told me you were only going to teach me how to kiss how could I have been so bloody stupid! I went to open the door but it was locked I looked at you with tears in my eyes and I asked as nicely as I could my words came out a whisper “please open the door.” You looked at me with a cold dead stare I had turned my back now I didn't want to look into your eyes any longer I was still trying to open the door I heard a low distant detached voice say “no you can't leave.” That was the last thing I heard until I woke up with you inside me and the worst headache I’ve ever felt in my life I tried screaming not realizing there was something in my mouth my body felt limp I couldn't move and I didn’t know why did you drug?

The major obstacle to this is the fact that instead of there being sidewalks in my neighborhood, there are ditches almost deep enough to be graves on both sides of the narrow road.",09May2019,1
118,"My own story is a troubled one. The founder of the organisation kept on telling me to come down, over a year now I decided I would give it a go. I've never looked back. It feels good to have friends I can be open with about how I'm feeling and knowing that, they've got my back and I've got their back.  In March they voted for me to become the secretary for the organisation. therapy through sport/ group recreational activities is the way forward for some.",09May2019,3
119,"It is my time to choose which subjects i will have as my highschool lastyear for the final 4 year test. I would like to study biology but would have to learn all from the previous years because i had bad grades and didn't study.I would like biology because i like being outdoors and most animals.I was thinking with biology there is a lot of studies but to me my free time is very important too. Maybe any suggestions, go for it or choose a different subject that will get me a job where i can have more free time.",09May2019,3
120,"I don't know what I'll rewatch in the near future because there's some shows that I haven't seen before that I want to watch first. If I had to pick, however, it might be Serial Experiments Lain. I barely remember it and I watched it a long time ago. Maybe if I watch it again I'll remember it and understand it more.",09May2019,3

125,"I've never really experienced this kind of loss before. I don't quite know how I can go back to my parents house where she lived and not be greeted with her absolutely tiny meows. How she would sit next to you on the sofa oh so patiently just waiting for you to make room on her lap for her. How covered in hair my desk chair in my childhood bedroom would become because she loved to sleep there.

She was my best friend basically all throughout my teenage years and now she's just gone. I never even got to say a proper goodbye because it was so sudden. By the time I was told by my family she had already been cremated and was just...gone.

The only thing that makes me feel even slightly better about this is that she didn't have to suffer for too long, and she was on painkillers for the last week of her life. And knowing we all spoiled her and loved her so much. I've already changed my phone background to a photo I love of her so I can still see her, and I've been looking through other photos and videos of me and her. I don't know if that is making it easier or harder.

All I know is that I lost someone very important to me today and I will always have a Jasmine sized paw print on my heart.",09May2019,5
126,"This was just a fun thought exercise. I LOVE thinking of things like this. 

Ok, you need two people who roughly look the same. One who works nights, the other who works days. Initially you'd both have to sneak in to the storage facility, but once inside... one person always stays there while the other one is out working. 

The night worker locks the night sleeper inside at night and then leaves for work. He comes back after work in the morning to unlock the storage unit so the day-worker can go to work. Rge day-worker then locks the day-sleeper in the storage unit. 

Note: they'd both have to look similar and wear the same clothes when exiting and entering. 

What do you think?  Doable?  I've never owned or even went into a storage unit facility so I may not be aware of some safeguards facilities have against people living in their storage units.",09May2019,1
127,"What does it feel like to have some level of self-esteem? 

I had only recently realized that most of my problems stem from my complete lack
of self-esteem. 

I have spent my whole life believing that I am inferior to everybody around me in some way or the other. At one point I even thought everybody felt this way, because it was the only way of life I had seen. 

I go through my day with an utter and total neglect of my own abilities, and I can’t believe it’s taken me so long to recognize how wrong this is.

Actually, I think my anxiety comes from this. For eg. I don’t actually have a fear of talking to other people, it’s just that I BELIEVE I can’t do it because they’re somehow better than me. 

But, i don’t know how to fix this???? Where does one even start to build up their self-esteem????",09May2019,1
128,"I’ve never been in a relationship and never done anything sexual so whenever i end up liking someone i just get scared of having to do intimate things with them so i push them away.

129,"Okay so this feels kind of unreal because it’s just like some movie-plot and I am still so touched by it. Even though it was a small gesture, it was the nicest thing I’ve ever seen anyone do. Sorry for any shitty English, it’s not my first language. 

I was having a really shitty day and I was on my way to the train I had to be in for the next 1.5 hour to get home. I felt really sad because something bad happened so couldn’t hold my tears anymore. I got in the train while still crying and sat down. Then a guy came sitting across of me. I saw him watching me so I tried to look away because I felt embarrased. 

He started writing in a noteblock, got the note out and put it on the small table between us. At first, I didn’t notice it was for me so I kept reading something on my laptop to not feel too ashamed by my own crying. He slid the note further towards me and really looked me deep in the eye. I opened it. It said: “Is there anything I can do for you?” I teared up a bit immediately again, smiled through my tears and shook my head. He then wrote something else and passed me the note again. “Maybe writing about it can help you? Feel free to do so :)”

I decided to write back. “This is the sweetest gesture someone has ever made. Had a bad day. You’re a really good person! Thank you so much” Passed him the note. He wrote me back. “Ah that sucks. In a few weeks, you’ll look back at this day and it won’t hurt as much as it does now. It’ll get better. Take care!” And then signed with his name. I wrote “Thank you so much” and signed with my name. Soon after that, he had to get out of the train. I looked at him and stuttered “Really, really thank you” and he winked and said “Sure, no problem”

I find this so nice and sweet and touching that I just had to share with you guys.",09May2019,1
131,Im just really happy with myself right now. When I went to college the first time around I completely wasted the opportunity and became a boarder line alcoholic.. I dont even remember attending a lot of my classes. I took a while off and got my esthetician license and now Im going to school for nursing. Im so happy I’ve finally found a passion for something that motivates me to finally achieve the things I want to. Nothing can stop me now. It feels good to say that.,09May2019,3

133,"I’m not really sure if this the right place but. I’ve been struggling ever since I left an emotionally abusive relationship. I knew he was bad for me. I knew that it wouldn’t work out in the end. I went into them the relationship with every intention of knowing that it would just be a quick physical fling. But it broke me in the end. I entered the relationship around the same time of finals of last year. I couldn’t sleep due to anxiety before him. I couldn’t eat before him. I didn’t know what was wrong. We broke it off in the summer of 2018. 

It was very out of character of me to just have casual sex with a random guy that I knew was going to be an issue. It usually takes me months, even years to give someone that kind of trust and he was the opposite type of guy I normally go for. I’ve only had 1 major relationships and this fling. 

This academic school year has been the fastest as I was numb the entire year. This was my first official year of “graduate school” as a part of my 7 year program. So I have been at the same school for 5 years. I isolated myself when I used to always have the urge to speak to people. I used to be part of many many clubs but I’ve pushed away all of the people I’ve met through them. My grades plummeted. I’ve never failed a class before and guessing from the title I guess you can see that I just failed my first. 

Grades were my everything. School used to be my everything. My reputation and friends were my everything. My self worth is so heavily tied in with my work/school. I know that I would have been beyond deviated if I ever failed a class previous year of undergrad. I’m devastated now, hence my anxious ass post. But I’m just wondering what the hell is going on with me. It’s a different kind of devastation. I’ m not as sad as I thought I would be and I’m not as worried as I thought that I would be. I’m just so confused as to how I feel and why I’m acting like this. 

I enjoy attending a school that is highly competitive I think. And I just enjoy the heavy course load because it gives me something to do. I don’t think I have any actual interest in my major. I just enjoy learning and knowing things. 

But the pressure to make money now that I’m 23 is causing so much stress on me. I realized I want a job that I have passion for. And I’m just longing for something different.  I think if I left, I think it might be worse because I don’t know what I would do with my life. 

I guess last summer I just asked myself this: if I stripped away everything that made me enjoy school and purely looked at the subject matter would I still be at there. And I think the answer is no. If I had a choice to do it all over again I think that I would have never come here. I think that I pushed here because my parents pushed me into believing that I wasn’t smart enough to get into medical school on my own or I wasn’t talented enough to make anything out of a creative endeavor. 

I don’t know if it’s the abusive relationship making me mad, or if it’s just a realization that I could have done something I enjoyed/had more passion for had I just stuck with my gut. 

At the same time I don’t know if I’m just suffering burn out or just being naive at this point as to how hard it would be actually get into medical school or achieve anything in art. But seeing how hard I’ve worked, and seeing how well I can do when I have a passion for something as really opened my eyes to the decisions that I made that were purely made out of fear. 

The stress and anxiety that I felt at the end of last year I felt like was my body telling me something was wrong. I’m usually able to get through the year just fine occupying myself with work, school and friends. But no matter how good things are going for me, I’m reminded of the dread that I felt the year that I was supposed to go into my graduate program. 

Thanks for reading if you’re still here.",09May2019,2
134,"Some bird made a nest inside of a vent or something in my house and it flies out of the hole every now and again. My workplace is basically right outside the backyard so I just go through my back fence gate to get there.
