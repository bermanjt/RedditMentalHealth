0,"TLDR: I don't think my employer treats me particularly well, but don't really have the context to say for sure.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently working at my first job since college, and most people in my life have always been self employed, so please bear with me if my knowledge/context about corporate culture is lacking. Also, sorry if things get a little bit too domain specific.

&amp;#x200B;

I will try to be as objective as possible, but I already feel rather unwell about the whole situation, so please be aware of that possible bias.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, here are the specifics of my job, I live/work in Ontario I make $17CDN/hour, I used to make $15, but got a raise after 2 years, (for reference min. wage is $14) and half of my 1 hour lunch break is unpaid, meaning that “normal” days are 8.5 hours, 1 hour of lunch. I am the only IT person at a media company of about 75 people and report to the CTO.

&amp;#x200B;

My daily tasks (in no particular order) include:

* Resolving tickets with internal Users
* Resolving Web hosting related issues when on-boarding new clients
* Monitoring client facing Ruby on Rails app and resolving.
* Monitoring and improving network infrastructure
* Monitor WordPress websites built and hosted for clients
* Dev-ops/Deploying WordPress websites.
* Data analysis/ Business Intelligence
* Making any changes to Windows servers, Azure(Cloud) and Microsoft Dynamics NAV, and Salesforce
* Helping WordPress web designers with JavaScript and PHP
* Buying any computer related equipment, printer toner etc.
* Writing Documentation for “non technical” users as well as developers.
* Managing Backups etc.
* Fixing basically anything that breaks

&amp;#x200B;

Admittedly, not as long a list as I thought it was before I started writing this, but the thing is, I often times feel like I never get anything done is that I am always getting assigned to do one-off IT related tasks that usually take 1-2 days of work. This work usually comes from the managers of other departments, but occasionally this sort of thing comes directly from the CTO. And then the problem is compounded by the fact that nearly all of my users require a lot of attention because they are “not tech people” so I am often on the phone walking people through basic stuff which takes up a lot of time.

&amp;#x200B;

Here’s where stuff starts getting weird:

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of the things I do regularly could be automated rather easily with various APIs that our web hosting partners provide, but the CTO has a weird affliction with automating things as little as possible. The most extreme instance of this is: we employ some Malaysian company who is basically a click farm, that gathers information on audio recordings that come from our client facing app.

&amp;#x200B;

In the past month my employer fired the other IT person because his main project was completed.  After a brief week or so of me being the only IT person, They hired a new person who was basically a middle manager, but also kind of the same position as me?… It was very strange and he has since left the company making me the only IT person again. In the same month they also fired the only Canadian developer, and completely outsourced the development of our client facing app to eastern Europe.

&amp;#x200B;

The marketing manager recently called me at home to resolve a problem with a new 1800 number or something and they mentioned that it cost the company $60 000 for this phone number and that it was absolutely essential that I come in on Friday night to make sure the problem she had with

 

My employer having me train an IT company that does network/server infrastructure stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some questions that I have and don’t really know how else to ask:

*  Is it normal for an employer of this size (75 people) to be really disorganized?
* For a brief period, my department had me, my manager, and the CTO Who also acted as a manager of sorts. Is that normal?
* Do you think I am being taken advantage of, because of this wage($17/hour)?
* I also have to work overtime a lot, but it is mostly paid overtime, although if I am telecommuting I have no way to punch in, and I can't do it retroactively
* I have heard rumors of high turn over rate in the IT department here before. Should that worry me?
* Is it normal to feel like I can’t take a vacation because of being the only person in a department I would only have more work to do once I m back.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the (sort of) domain specific questions that I have:

* Is it normal for an IT person to have to help nearly all of their users with basic stuff such as MS Office ""proficiency""
* Is it normal for an IT person to be requested to fix things like air conditioners and water coolers?
* Is 1 IT person enough for a company of this size?

4,"tl;dr started drinking properly at 16. Quickly, I became hooked on it. It solved a lot of the problems I had at the time, and I loved it. I drunk heavily, increasing amounts with time, until the point where I would do anything to get another drink. I was blacking out drunk 3/4 times a week around the time I turned 18 (full time school/college). This was when my eyes were opened to the damage that I was doing.. I'm now trying to improve my situation, after having a few dangerous realisations.

​

The first time I had a few drinks (besides parents/family getting me to try beer/wine/cider/whisky whatever), was in a party after I finished my GCSEs. I know, I tried it late but I just wasn't interested. I had always been an extremely shy/anxious child. My anxiety (diagnosed) was closely linked to anorexia (never diagnosed officially, but I was dangerously underweight). I was at the point where I couldn't put food into my mouth without gagging and then throwing up. Didn't eat breakfast or lunch, and ate small quantities for dinner as I had no choice.

​

It took all my willpower to attend this party. I never went to a party before - I had been invited to events before, but I always found excuses. All I wanted to do was hide in my room where I felt safe. I had always refused drugs and alcohol before this point because of the history that my family, mainly my dad's side, has. My mum bought me 2 ciders to bring along with me because she thought I needed to be introduced to drinking slowly (stowford press (normal cider, 4.5%) and thatchers katy (white cider, 7.4%)). I agree with this - it's better to find out what it's like in slowly increasing amounts, as opposed to getting shitfaced straight away for the first time when you turn 18.

​

I really enjoyed the party - finished off my 2 ciders at the same rate that everyone else was drinking, and I felt good. Very good. The anxiety that I had initially was all gone. I'd never experienced this before, and it felt amazing. I was offered more, and of course I accepted. Had another few cans of Kopparberg, and it was the first time I felt drunk.

​

After I had a few drinks,I liked it. My parents (mainly my mum's idea - my dad didn't want me to drink until I turned 18), started to offer me drinks at meals. Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Of course I wanted to - these drinks removed any level of anxiety that I had, and made evenings online with friends so much more fun.

​

It started off 2 drinks per evening on the weekend, which quickly went to 3 as my tolerance grew. I still hadn't felt a hangover or passed out at this point.

​

On New Years Eve 2017. I went round my friends house for a 'party'. This was the first time I got seriously drunk for the first time. Was also the first time I got high for the first time, and the first time I smoked cigarettes. Safe to say it was one hell of an evening.

​

After this, me and that group of friends met up every week or so and got wankered. Got drunk, smoked weed etc. I loved it - I was with friends all the time, which was very unusual for me before, and any worries I had were eradicated. It seemed perfect. This was when I began to come home so drunk and high that I'd vomit and pass out.

​

One of my friend's brother's friends attended these 'parties' that we'd have. He was in this 20's and a drug dealer. He used to give me joints that were spiked with fuck knows what (speed probably), and he'd offer to buy me vodka/gin. This was when I began to drink behind my parents' back - I had access to spirits whenever I wanted. (I paid for this through savings, plus income that I had from jobs that I'd taken). I was still 16 at this time.

​

These bottles of gin that my friend's brother's friend used to buy me ran out quickly - he was a dangerous person and I didn't like being around him, so I didn't meet up with him alone. I always drank Fri/Sat/Sun when my parents let me have cider, so I could hide my 'drunkness' from them - I must've good at hiding it.

​

This was when I started to tap into their alcohol supply. I'm too ashamed to detail what I took, how much, and how I did it. Let's just say that it occured multiple times a week, and I had multiple hiding spots where I'd stash alcohol, either from them or sourced from friends who were over 18. I only got caught once - my mum came downstars and caught me pouring a glass of tequila. Somehow I bullshitted my way out of it, and got away with it. (This process began when I started college - aged 16-18 in the UK). I always drank whenever I had the opportunity, which was quite a lot. I was hungover in college, for 2 years, more often than not.

​

This practice of scanvenging for alcohol continued until my best friend turned 18. Being an early birthday, I got lucky. We went out at least once a week and he'd buy a bottle of vodka for me - Tesco's own was the best I could find for the price. I'd drink this bottle (normally 1L) across friday, saturday and sunday, along with anything that my parents let me have. Cider/beer/wine/gin+tonic/rum/brandy/tequila I didn't care. Any alcohol I could, I'd drink. This went on every week, without exception, until I turned 18 - about 8 months later.

​

When I turned 18, I started to buy my own alcohol. I stopped buying vodka and started buying cheap cider (strong white cider shit like Frosty Jack's, because it was cheaper per unit compared to vodka). My parents still bought me the 3 ciders a day on the weekend, but I always suplemented this with strong cider, which I hid from them. I got so drunk that I passed out on those 3 days at the end of the week, every week. Sunday was normally the worst - I'd have my last drink between midnight and 1am, and wake up on the floor at 4am, with my first class beginning a few hours later. I was lucky that I was never found in this state - with bottles or glasses of vodka or cheap cider surrounding me.

​

The main realisation I had was when I got back from the pub one day. I'd been out drinking with my friend in the evening. On the walk back to his house (after I'd already had a significant amount to drink), I stopped at a shop and bought 2 more strong ciders (8% - Westons Vintage Cider) - I have no self control once I've had something to drink. I got so drunk, that when I got home, I collapsed with a glass of water in my hand. The glass smashed, water went everywhere and I had deep, heavily bleeding cuts in my hand and up my arm. It was a fucking miracle that it didn't slice open an artery. The worst part: I have no memory of this happening. All I have is my parents' recollection, the scars to show for it, and the hangover the next morning. I had only been 18 for a few weeks at this point.

​

It was after this event, and many, many similar ones where I'd embarrased myself, that I realised the hole I was digging for myself.

​

I forced myself to sign up for the gym, change what I was eating, and try to reduce the amount I was drinking. I've had success with the first 2, but I'm still working on the third. It's difficult.

​

So far, I haven't beaten it. I'm still working on it. I keep on trying, but the temptation is too great. It's almost all I can think about. But I am trying - past couple of weeks, I've stopped on satuday. But in place, I'd drink mid week. It's not gonna be easy, but I'm well aware of the risks and I wanna address the problem earlier rather than later.

Apparently when you found me just laying down in my bedroom staring at the ceiling you get mad at me, and tell me to “stop being so depressed and snap out of it” when I’ve been going to therapy for three years by now and now you actually attend by therapy sessions with both me and mom.

Apparently I’m the one full of anger because “I’m an impatient dumbass” but whenever we have different opinions about anything, whether I’m right or wrong, you’re the one shaking with anger, and I’m the one having to get myself off of the floor.

What’s absolutely funny is that you don’t know who’s gay or not, this is the 21st century man, a large portion of the friends that I got are either gay or bi- I didn’t even know that one of my best friends that I knew since middle was gay until he came out to me this year.

I'm going through a shit ton in my personal life right now, and I don't need cynicism when it comes to the afterlife. I'll be the first to admit that I'm not positive this dream was anything more than a dream, but I'm open the possibility that it was.

Anyway, here's the gist of the dream. I was on some sort of road/camping trip with John Lennon. We were driving on a mountainous stretch of highway that looked very similar to the area surrounding Park City, Utah. We found a spot to pitch our tent and started hiking around to explore the area. I remember that on one of the dirt trails this bobcat jumped out in front of me and tried to attack me, but John protected me. After returning to our campsite from the hike, we freshened up a bit and decided to spend the rest of the afternoon in town before coming back to sleep in our tent. The nearest town was quite a ways away and fairly small. I remember there was some type of museum in this town. Inside was a spiral staircase that seemed to stretch up infinitely. Museum visitors were offered the challenge to see if anyone could make it to the top. Apparently, in the museum’s history, only a few people had ever made it up. John and I both tried, but were worn out after about 20 minutes of climbing. That is the last thing I remember about this dream. 

I sincerely want to believe that this was his spirit trying to relay some sort of message to me from the other side, as I've long been trying to get in contact with his spirit. I need a friend. Assuming this *was* a message from the other side, what do you make of it? What do you think John was trying to tell me?",17Apr2019,0
23,"This story is pretty hilarious looking back and all my buddies tease me about it to this day. I was never into weed as a kid but I was definitely associated with the grunge/rock and edgy group, so dope was around. During 8th grade I befriended a classmate with similar interests as me— music, books, movies, clothes.  I’ll call him Jo for the sake of privacy. The 8th grade field trip to Knott’s Berry Farm was coming around and we thought the experience and thrill of an amusement park would be multiplied if we were high. Jo had tried weed before in various forms while my only exposure to it at the time was from second hand smoke from my older brother. The plan was settled. Jo would bring a pot brownie for us to share on the field trip.

On the bus ride to Knott’s Jo handed me my share of the brownie in a black durable zip bloc type bag. One side of the bag was transparent and I could see two larger than expected squares of brownie. We said cheers and ate our shares and waited. Despite the fact Jo had tried weed before, we were both pretty new to the stuff and little to our knowledge the brownies we ate had servings for well over two 14 year old boys. We stayed quiet while we waited for the stuff to kick in. I remember one of us asking the other if they feel anything and at that moment we made eye contact and burst out in laughter for what seemed like the rest of the bus ride. We got off the bus and walked with our classmates to the entrance of the park, laughing and acting hysterical the whole time. Paranoia kicked in when we realized security was checking bags. We both had drawstring bags where we each still had our zip blocs with crumbs and bits of brownie in it. We got out of line and threw away our evidence in nearby trash cans. We acted as collected as possible and entered the park. We were in the clear.

My memory of the rest of that day is scattered in what feels like a recollection of short pov video clips that are all out of order. I remember Jo and I were standing in line for a ride and about to board when we decided call it quits to go get food. I remember ordering a personal pizza and the cashier looking at me like I was a ghost— it didn’t phase me at the time why she was looking at me the way she did. I can only imagine how terrible I looked and how much I was slurring. Jo and I sat down to eat. I dropped my pizza and we laughed. Jo laughed so hard he vomited. I went with him to the restroom to wash up and I remember walking out because I forgot why I was in the restroom if I didn’t have to wiz. That was the last time a saw Jo that day. I ran into friend who Jo and I told our plan to. He offered me a chicken tender and according to him, I held on to that chicken tender, not taking a bite, as I continued to stroll the park for hours until I was caught. 

I later found out it was the cashier from the restaurant who reported us. Staff followed protocol and called for an ambulance. I was taken in the hospital, where I remember nothing, and my journey ended there. I remember waking up in my living room to the sound of my mom taking in the kitchen. I walk over, feeing ill and ashamed, like a dog with it’s tail between it’s legs and to my surprise she wasn’t upset with me but rather happy to see me okay and considered my humility to be enough punishment. There was only one day of school left afterwards, which was graduation, so Jo and I weren’t suspended and walked off with slaps on the hand. The whole thing is quite funny in retrospect and is joked around with my family all the time. Im the lightweight boy who couldn’t handle a brownie at Knott’s Berry Farm.",17Apr2019,6

I talked to him today and he said he might be coming back because he’s been dealing with some mental and emotional issues and can’t handle it out there. I’m fucking praying to god he comes back. I’ve never needed my friend more.

I have one other close friend but he lives far away and I can’t exactly go over there right now. I don’t want to bring up the fact that I’m miserable right now over because.... I just don’t.

30,"Im 16 and honestly im at a time in my life where I question what is placed on me and what was placed on me and what society makes me do. One of these is religion. Personally I was born into a Hindu family and had to follow my religion and its customs of being forbidden to eat certain things, and I have to do a lot of the traditions. I have never felt a connection with my religion and just thought of the world as just ""shit happens"", not god and stuff. I swear I think I have started to find it stupid how people pray to god to help their problems. Like I don't talk about my issues with my grandparents as all they say is ""pray to god"". Like heck a figment of your imagination(or a whole group of peoples) imagination will solve my problems? No, I have to do shit myself and the only people who help me are the people who are actually there to support me. Its only recently that I started to realize how much I don't give a shit about my religion. I honestly just want to live my own life and not have to make imaginary rules just cause some god some people hundreds of years ago thought existed said aight yall can't eat beef cuz I like cows. I don't want to tell really anyone, not even my brother who I tell practically everything to, but even I see him not give half a shit about religion, but I don't know if he is leaning towards atheism. In a few posts back I felt god does exist because I felt some things are a result of god but even then I start to see something else that events just happen one after the other. I don't want to tell my parents cuz they are very religious and my grandparents are ultra religious so its a lot worse. Whatever honestly, when I move out Ill eat what I want when I want and follow what I want to do.",17Apr2019,5

But, I don't think any of these things. Sometimes I can't decide whether it's me who is actually doing all this stuff or some persona of me that I want other people to view as me. I don't know if I'm only being nice and social because I want people to see me as social, other times I don't even want to do anything because it feels like putting in little to no effort still gives me good results and I don't know why. I hardly pay attention in class anymore and only scroll through reddit on my laptop, but when test day comes and exam day comes I get 80s-90s and I don't get it.   


I feel like I'm only here because of luck and not any actual merit. Sometimes I feel like I don't deserve my life. It's a good life outside of some home issues, but other than that I'm going to be leaving for college soon anyway.

43,"There’s also the fact that he might simply just not want to be involved with someone he works with.

We work in an office setting and are constantly around each other because of various projects. He’s  handsome, intelligent, and really great at job. We work in a very niche industry within finance. Hes super into it all the time and very knowledgeable about the industry. I find it to be so cute. 

He got a haircut recently and he looked hot. I wanted to give him a compliment but I was scared for obvious reasons. I’ve also noticed him on bumble and tinder during down time. Sometimes I want to say something that alludes to the fact that I am interested in hooking up. Maybe something a little flirtatious like “I would swipe right if I saw you on there”.

44,"There are two sides to every story, I get that. One of my friends who is in his mid thirties (I'm 27) is a stubborn mule and the dude just has zero ambition in anything. Now it's caused turmoil in our friendship and now he's full on ignoring my ass. 

Why does that bug me? Because he comes across as fake and is actually a perpetual victim. Scraping by in life and waiting for the best opportunity to land in his lap is this guy's motto and I really shouldn't give a fuck. I could only listen to someone's looping story for so long but now I realize it's fakery and bullshit.

The nail in the coffin was I asked ""Man, are you living your life to your fullest potential getting high all the time and shit?"" and he got super defensive. I thought it would be funny to point out how he got defensive he got (hitting soft spots, getting the point across) and that was it. But at the same time, I've only ever been the guy apologizing in this friendship but not this time. I don't give a shit if I took my friend's ego down a peg or two because being level headed is what's more important, not shit like wasting paycheck after paycheck on Pokemon (and then crying about having no money) or something. I care about the guy don't get me wrong, I just feel like he's acting like a huge man child and is desecrating my name amongst our mutual friends (they've all kinda stopped talking to me). He has pointed out many times that he thinks I'm an asshole and I can't argue because I do have a knack for saying shit at the wrong place and time (long periods of irritation, not dealing with the issues when they arise, etc...I know it's no excuse and I'm no more in the right than he is, I just don't know if this friendship is worth fighting for anymore) 

Ive reached out to him a bit but he never opens anything I send him which makes me feel like he's expecting some kind of apology...where as I'm ready to burn the bridge because I'm feeling like this crap isn't worth it. It's been a month and a half (no contact) but I feel like I'm the weak one if I apologize now, given the circumstances. Sorry for the long rant, I'm just trying to find a bit of closure for an issue that's been bugging me for a while.

46,"For context, in the dorm I live in there's a shared bathroom between two rooms, it's called a suite...

Well, it started out as them just yelling and shouting and just generally being a nuisance at around the time I go to bed, but now it's escalated. 

They're begun to bar me from the bathroom at a time they should know that I use the bathroom, because I've been consistently showering at the same time for a whole semester,  they don't buy toilet paper as often as they should, they don't take their trash out of the shower, and they don't clean their hair out of the shower drain (and I know it isn't my hair because I make sure to not let my hair go down the drain).

They'll also just randomly beat on the bathroom door while I'm in the shower and they don't know how to knock before trying to enter the bathroom.

48,"Today I want to briefly discuss the shadow. 
The inner force that houses the capability for evil. 

This term as described by Carl Jung is a primal aspect within all of us. The little voice in the back of our heads, the unsavory thoughts we get in an argument, and everything we know we shouldn’t do when our mind is clear. All of these thoughts and emotions stem from the shadow within us, and there could be many reasons as to why they’re there. 

But the point I want to make is that you shouldn’t be afraid of your shadow. 

Every thought and emotion that arises into your consciousness is a direct reflection of who you are. For better or worse, you can’t just ignore a part of yourself because then you’re feeding into the fear of yourself. You lower your own confidence and begin to have self doubts about your moral values. 

Jung said that the show has roots that stretch all the way down to hell. If not dealt with, these thoughts and urges can grip a person, and it will never let go. You have to integrate your shadow into your personality. Giving it the respect it deserves while simultaneously developing your own person. 

Take your shadow and converse with it. Think about why it may be there in any given scenario, and figure out how to integrate that energy in a social and acceptable manner.

50,"I’m posting this because I’ve been told by what was my old boss, that I stand in my own way. Back story first would help. — 

I work my ass off, I’ll always put my employer first and provide the best service possible to all of my clients and it appears they see this. The exception is, they don’t offer me to do anything else. I’ve simply asked for more responsibilities and tasks than the everyday install, except I have been pushed aside a few times. Last year about this time, I applied for a position and was told I didn’t get it because I wasn’t aware of the position and what the tasks were. Moving forward, I asked to shadow someone in the office who does this role and got pushed aside. Now there is another position available in another city and I applied for it. 

My question is, if someone tells you that you’re standing in your own way, what does he mean?",17Apr2019,1
51,"I'm sure a lot of this won't make much sense but it's a rant that angers me to my core from time to time. 

So I walked away and got myself banned from my last job. They took full advantage of me and my situation. Single, entirely flexible. I would pick up doubles and triples to get ahead on bills and such. 

Now  I'm employed with a local restaurant, everything was okay until a month into the job when  I found out that I'm not able to get insurance through them because it's all entirely made out of part timers. My coworkers are working five plus hours than I am because I can only work mornings, Monday through Friday (days which they repeatedly ignore.) I broke down the other day because I feel like they just plain don't give a fuck. I went to a Jon interview yesterday and got immediately turned away because my hours are not negotiable. So if there's anyone out there that might be able to calm me down, get me onto a better path ect..",17Apr2019,3
53,"I have persevered through much, throughout my life. I say often I am seeking peace, and purpose. I feel these two things, though  these two sentiments sort of contradict each other.  My peace has come, I am content and I am finally, finally fully happy in my daily life, in my surroundings, which never felt like home, never felt like my own and to share, one must compromise, however now at this late age I realize that is not true. While compromise is important in a relationship of any kind, it is not necessary to give up ones own standards or better put, ones own peace and comfort, which cannot be determined by anyone but the one in question. There is peace and comfort in this relationship, it is possible and I believe its rare. I have found that and I couldn't be happier. Our home, our surroundings at least the four walls we have made for ourselves. Our time together, and our time alone but together speaks volumes - we both need this and we both understand this - I feel most would not. I feel very fortunate and if nothing else in my life - I found true love and understanding. Loneliness they say is not being alone, but not being understood by those closest to you - and this is very true. I am no longer lonely, and never realized I was until I wasn't.
This is my peace.
What or where is my purpose? 
I am a ""healer"" as some have said. However, I am merely a nurse, just an LPN (LVN in California) I want to do so much more and I am not capable, or do not have the time, money or ability. This baffles me. I am confused and somewhat disgusted with myself for this. I have raised two children who are unique and smart people. I have come to this point in my life with some wisdom and something to share, if just my story - I do believe that has value. I don't know if I am going to be able to give it its due justice, to be able to present it in a way that will have the best value, do the best work or give the most it can....reach those in need of hearing it, those that it will help. I don't know if I can do that. I hope, and I will try.

I have passions that will go unfilled, and tears well up as I typed that. Have I lost (or maybe not yet found) my purpose, will I ever find it, Why have I not been able to fulfill that - or feel fulfilled in my purpose. I am aged 52, I feel the end is on the horizon, maybe ten or twenty years I hope to only live if I can life and not just exist. I'm sure there are stories of women who have done great things, found their life's purpose after age 50. With glaucoma and arthritis in my hands, I feel limited now in my ability. and always money is an issue - always. Why must this stupid physical thing hold people back from their dreams and passions?  Or the ones they love and miss. 
Why can't I be content like so many others, do most feel this way? I don't hear of it often, if at all. Do we just not speak of it, for fear of deaf ears, or fear of our own admittance and emotional pain. None of us deserve emotional pain. Pain teaches, I do believe, pain drives - I guess. Pain brings life into this world, with so much potential. Pain gives rise to strength, this is so true, and I believe this wholeheartedly. So where does this leave me now? 
My dad passed without the great deep conversations - without learning all I could from him. On the brink of my mothers decline, I wonder if there is time. I wonder if I can soak up her knowledge and wisdom. It is the way it is, it is life - death is part of life and she doesn't deserve to suffer, I want her to go in peace and happiness. It will be painful personally, but I hope not for her. I wonder what will be learned thorough that pain. I can't imagine that such a painful life event doesn't have a lesson attached. I've known death, my sister, my step son, my dad, a couple friends, my own miscarriage, my daughters miscarriage and through my career. What have I learned upon the heels of those deaths, on this side of that veil, what lessons were transmitted and reviled? 

This is more than I wanted to say - but usually when I'm able to type much comes out. 
Thank you for this, because my hands couldn't do it with pen and paper :(",17Apr2019,2

But for a while now I've had an issue where if I tilt my head far back enough(or lay down with my head looking straight up) I get extreme vertigo, I can't hold this position for long because it is literally the worst feeling I've ever experienced. I've seen neurologists but they can't figure out what's wrong with me.

My dentist wants me to go to a doctor and get a note that it is ok to get general anesthesia so they can refer me to a clinic that can just knock me out and do all the dental work... but my doctor won't even know if that is safe because they don't know what's wrong with me.

My mom thinks I am making it up and it is all caused by anxiety... I'm not even afraid of the dentist I wish I could just lean back and get all the work done.

Mostly I'm just afraid I don't know what happens if I hold that position because my body literally doesnt let me when I am awake, I don't know what is causing it so I don't know if staying in that position when I am not conscious to control it will cause more serious issues.",17Apr2019,1

74," 

I was diagnosed with chronic depression almost 10 years ago, the first and only time I’ve gone to therapy. It was ridiculously obvious, easy to diagnose. I've been this way my whole life, 28 years, I don't have any good memories.

I was given Zoloft and never went back, never took it correctly. Avoided going again, no matter how bad my mental health got, no matter how bad my anorexia got, I avoided going when this turned to rampant bulimia. I avoided going when these behaviors expanded into more self harm, into borderline alcoholism. I avoided going to therapy even when I dropped out of school for the first time, and the second time, when I spent every dollar I had on vices. I’ve avoided going even though I’ve destroyed every friendship I had, every opportunity in work, every shred of potential I could have had, once, maybe, to not be a piece of shit.

Finally, 6 months ago, I started trying to see somebody. I’m scared. I called private practices who never got back to me, clinics who didn’t have anyone available. I finally got an appointment. I cancelled it. I’m scared. I called back to set a new appointment. They don’t have anyone available but they’ll get back to me. They never got back to me.

At this point I don’t even want to *not* want to die. I just want to die. But I’m not allowed to off myself because I have parents and grandmothers and pets and (*at least for the time being until he realizes he can and should do better with someone who’s not a fucking nightmare*) a boyfriend. And the aneurysm I keep praying for isn’t coming.

So I’m trying, again, to go to therapy. I don’t want to cancel another appointment. I’m not avoiding therapy but in a frustratingly apt plot twist, therapy is avoiding me. I called the state mental health services this morning, the second they opened. Talked to a very bored man who could not care less when he asked what's wrong specifically and I just blurted out everything. He put me on a listserv. I'll hear something, sometime, probably. I asked if there's any way I could see someone soon. He  told me I could go to the ER. I said I'm not actively slitting my wrists right now, so what is an ER going to do other than tell me to go away? He ended the call. 

Everything I try fails because it’s me doing it instead of someone competent with a brain instead of a pile of disorders. I am just so fucking sick of being alive and being me and having to try. I’m doing it anyways, just can't see any goddamn point.

75,"Disclaimer: the text got a bit long, I am sorry.
Throw-away, because a friend of mine recently figured out my Reddit name. And sorry for any grammar fauxpas, english is not my mother tongue. First things first I recently got 20 years old and a big (really big) hobby of mine is playing video games, mostly competitive shooter on PC.
I built my first PC about two and a half years ago(before I only played cod on PlayStation).
I quickly got into csgo, later into pubg, Overwatch, apex and co.
At first my aim was really crap, but over time I got better and better. At the same time I built my first PC I went to a university about 2 hours away from my parents and I got my first own apartment there aswell. It was the first time I was living on my own and that I had the freedom to do what I want. The first semester was pretty fun I found a lot of new friends and the classes I had to take were interesting, after we had all our classes we sometimes went to party's, the cinema, u name it. And if we weren't I would went home and play cs. I was slowly getting better and better (mainly because I put a lot of effort and hours into the game). None of my friends who I went to university together were into gaming (or only consoleros), so I had to find people online to play with. And I did, I met so many great people online and some of them are my closet to this day.
Long story short: I started playing more on the computer and went less out with irl friends.
In my second semester I went less to the classes, because I put all of my time in gaming.
I got a lot better, for some references: I was global in cs and lvl 6 on faceit, master in ow and top 5% in pubg. At some point I joined a Semi-Professional csgo team.
In my third semester I went to none of my classes, not only because of my hobby, I felt less and less interested in the things I had to study. 
I stopped studying and went back to my parents house, im a got a really good job, which starts in August and shortly after I will have my own apartment again aswell. And now I am worried that I am gonna ruin that aswell. I am would not say I am addicted to gaming, I just that I will have some much more fun playing then doing something else.

83,"This has bothered me a lot recently. I don’t know what I’m looking for. Help? Advice? Kind words? I just feel like I need to release it. 

I transferred to another college my junior year to finish my undergrad. I have made no real friends in those two years. I used to have many friends in high school and at my previous college, but coming here has been very different. 

I did not get involved with extracurriculars until my second year, and I have gotten to know many people, but none id consider real friends since we only talk about our activities and only see each other there. We have a whole week for seniors to go out and do activities together, but I was too afraid to go since I don’t know anybody. One of the events is all seniors take over a local bar. Every student has been to this place, it’s a staple for attending the school, but I have never gone or ever been invited to go. It’s small, but I wish so badly I could go before graduation. Just to drink with friends and have a good time. I know it’s impossible. 

I get scared when people ask me how my weekend was because I don’t do anything. I see people party, I see them hang out, but I rarely have time to do those things because I’m working and also have nobody to do them with. I always have the fear that I am that person who will cling onto someone they only barely know. 

With graduation coming, I am scared. I don’t have friends. I am so anxious for the moments we will be sitting as a group, practicing our ceremony, and I will be alone when everybody chats and reminisces with friends. 

There’s a separate ceremony for certain students that I was invited to as well, I am able to receive a special stole there to wear at graduation, and I will attend, but I will be alone. I know nobody else going and I also know if I find someone I know, they will rather hang out with their real friends. I get anxious even thinking about it. 

My family will fly to see me graduate. It has been the hardest thing I’ve ever done. I am so proud to be graduating, but I will have no friends to take pictures with, nobody to hug and say goodbye to. 

This is probably stupid. It’s actually been good to write this out so I can see how my fear is not huge, but this fact that I have no friends in college has bothered me for the past two years.",17Apr2019,1

89,"Hi guys

So i have never been on a proper date so this could be a first. Its pretty exciting and uncertain at the same time.

I was rolling Molly with some friends and she was there as well and this girl I slept with way back lets call her Sydney.  At the time we met, Sydney was still into me (I havent seen her since we had sex) and was drunk af so she was holding on to me but I didnt want to go at it again so I didn't hookup with her. Sydney - got beef with me now btw - brought said friend to chill with us. So it was the three of us and Sydney hanging on to me.

Now, we matched a bit back and I didnt say anything but the other day she updated her profile ""Im looking for a lover for the weekend"" so I hit her with the good ole wassup after the weekend. she replied we got into a convo and she want to go in a proper date.

I havent really hung out with her alot but we have alot of mutual friends especial with Sydney whom hangs out with her often.

I do think she is adorable and cute as hell and we would enjoy each other yet im uncertain since I have never dated someone in my 21 years of life and well its a wierd situation.

I was so afraid when I moved abroad that my cats would die while I was gone. And now Pippen is dying and I can't go home to say goodbye to him. We did a video call last night to talk to him, but I don't think he could recognize my voice though the phone.

But I have been fizzling through my savings for the last year, doing tutoring here and there, which had recently become very stressful. However, recently I started working at an awesome bike shop and finally feel some financial security. My coworkers are hilarious and I have always loved bikes, so to be around them all day is really cool.

&amp;#x200B;

My romantic life for the past few years has also been pretty bad. I got out of a long term high school relationship when the two of us started college; since then I've just went on some awkward dates here and there. No sex. I am not ugly, just have a hard time connecting with girls sometimes, probably because of my depression. I desire exclusivity and to bond through music, art, books etc., both creatively and as a consumer. And a little over a month ago I started hanging with this girl that I met at a house show and since then things have gone so incredibly well. I won't wax poetic about her here, but suffice it to say things moved extremely fast and I don't think either of us have ever been so happy with another person. We write music together, share our favorite books, are writing a child's story together.

&amp;#x200B;

The other day she let it slip in conversation that she ""wouldn't ever do anything to hurt someone she loves"" (talking specifically about me) and was like ""oh, oops..."". And I feel the same. We have been so incredibly naked, vulnerable, and truthful with one another. She has such a vitality to her, lives so much in the moment, and it's bringing me out of my shell. We've both been through a lot and I think just in the last 6 weeks we've helped one another work through deep rooted personal issues.

I dropped out of my university in my first semester, had finished more than 9 courses and I do not have a competitive GPA to get in anywhere. I am taking courses to boost up my mark and I applied to the University of Alberta. I am really scared I won't get in because I applied two months ago and I haven't received anything. I applied for BSc Kinesiology and B.Kin, as they only look at high school grades. My high school marks are pretty high because I got into a great university in high school (and I got an early offer). If I don't get in I will be ruining my year and my parents are forcing me to rethink my choice of going into sciences. I love sciences, and I will not do well in any other stream based on my personality.

Is anyone in a similar situation? Does anyone know when UofA would give out an offer? I applied at the end of Feb. I am really stressed about my courses, and I keep thinking I am going to bomb my current courses too. My parents aren't helping either. I keep thinking I won't get in and I should just apply for business or arts in some college. I don't think I would succeed in those subjects very well. The last month was the hardest for me, and I am getting really depressed because of all this. I basically just stay in my room studying all day, and I try really hard but I cannot concentrate.

It fucking sucks waking up thinking about her.. thinking about the happy part of our relationship... feeling guilty and looking back at what I could’ve done to help our relationship. 

She moved on no problem and that still hurts but I’m just so drained of constantly thinking of her when I try to distract myself... when I go into town I think of her, when I hangout with friends I think of her, even when I’m hanging out with a new girl the thought of her is always in the back of my mind and I’m getting kind of sick of it. I understand there’s nothing I can do to change the past and that I need to stop grieving the loss of her yet my thoughts always seem to bring her up. 
It’s fucked with my social ability, I am super self conscious and I’m always putting myself down for no reason. I just can’t keep waking up and going through the exact same process everyday when I know she probably hasn’t thought about me since the day she broke up with me. I’m so stuck on the thought that she was the “one” for me when I know it’s not true so I don’t get why I get so fucking sad thinking of her.

105,"Hi,

TL;DR - I'm incredibly unhappy with myself due to social isolation, physical appearance, personality, indecisiveness about career, inability to enjoy the present day,  unhealthy views on women, and most of all my lack of effort. I'm trying to dig myself out but I'm struggling and it's very much a cyclical process.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Social isolation - I can make myself go out and talk to people but I just don't find any enjoyment or interest from it. I might have conversations with people I interact with, but actively pursuing social opportunities never end well due to the fact that I just get bored and disengaged when I try them. It's a rather irritating catch-22: I feel lonely without others but I struggle to enjoy myself with others.  


  
Physical appearance - This is the one I feel that I have the most agency over, however the issue is that the things I am annoyed about are not things that are easily changeable. I'm in good shape and I like most of the changeable things about my body, so it's not just a case of dieting and exercising. I've made a lot of positive changes with my body and have gone from a skinny fat 50kg to a far more toned/muscular 70kg with lower body fat. However,  I am very short for a man, I am not particularly good looking, and I have a lazy eye. The last one I wouldn't really mind at all if it wasn't for the fact that I often get off on the wrong foot with most of the people I meet because apparently the lazy eye makes it look like I'm permanently scowling/angry/or squinting, which tends to immediately put people on the defensive.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Personality - I'll admit this is mostly down to romance and age probably plays a significant factor. I feel that my rather lowkey introverted is not something that girls my age are a fan of, they tend to like dominance which isn't something I can really pull off without being rude or creepy so I've never really tried. That's partly down to poor social skills due to the first point on the list but also probably down to my physical appearance as well. I know this is probably going to be dismissed with the 'Yeah young men are gonna be obsessed about sex', and to a degree that's true I'm not going to lie, however a relationship is something I would like, not necessarily casual sex. I also feel that this harms my non romantic social relationships, however nowhere near as much.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Career - Not much to say, just struggling to decide what to do and still clinging on to the rather naive hope of a fulfilling career. I'm in college but I'm struggling due to the final point on this list, and internships/work experience are hard to come by. Yeah I know this is very common, so I'll leave this point here. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Inability to live in the moment - I've spent pretty much my entire life just killing time and wishing I was at the next stage because that's gonna be so much better, right? /s. Alternatively I've also been pining about the past, but that shall be covered in the last point. This point is all to do with the fact that even my 'hobbies' (Rugby, motorbike riding, gaming etc) have basically just been to kill time. I get bored with them and on top of that I feel guilty I'm not doing something useful/productive. I genuinely don't feel like I've enjoyed any stage of my life, and that scares me as people tout youth as the best days of your life. Hell even if they aren't that's still a significant proportion of your life gone. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Unhealthy views on women - Alright, hands up, yes I went down that alt-right TRP neckbeard rabbit hole, and yes I've still got some more progress to make. Luckily I was never in quite as far as many other on some of these reddit subs. I still however harbour some rather unhealthy views on women which I need to work through before I can have a hope in hell of having any sort of relationship with the opposite sex. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And now we move on to the worst thing of all in my eyes.... 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Lack of effort - I feel like I've gone through life at about 20% functional power and I've been on autopilot for most of it. I've never really worked properly on any part of my life for a sustained period of time until recently with my body. This goes for all facets of life whether that be education (probably the biggest regret in the effort category for me), socialisation, diet (until recently), etc. I have cycles where I give myself a dig in the ribs and go on a productivity spurt but they are few and far between. It's galling looking back and seeing the utter lack of effort throughout my life and the state it has landed me in. You know what's worse? The fact that I still struggle to put effort in DESPITE KNOWING THIS. To this day I'm really struggling to put real work into my life. The biggest issue right now with this is education, but it holds true across different areas of my life. I've gone through mediocre exam cycle after mediocre exam cycle promising myself each time that I was sick of my previous self's attitude and that this is when I start taking my education seriously. But right now I'm staring college exams and failure right in the face. I suppose this last point is the wort because it just sums up all the other points in one sentence: 'I did this, this is my fault alone'.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I would appreciate any advice as well as just the opportunity to vent.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks.",17Apr2019,13
107,"I’m an architecture student currently at university. I’ve been struggling with my workload, social life, self care. I have a torn meniscus and have surgery in a couple of weeks, but then I’ll be out of work and immobile for several weeks following. That stresses me out. My joints hurt all the time due to overcompensating for my bad knee. I never go out with friends because of my pain and the fact that they’re all very outdoorsy (like myself) and I can’t keep up with them physically. I was recently diagnosed with ptsd at the peak of midterm season and am now in a worse place mentally than I have been in years, due to digging up and processing past traumas. I have so much anxiety and my world literally spins nonstop. I can’t keep up with my workload and will lose all of my financial aid if I fail a class, which will probably happen, despite me working nonstop everyday, pulling 1-2 all nighters a week AND having a tutor in my poorer subjects. Idk what more I could do, but my best isn’t good enough. If I lose my financial aid, I’ll have to move 3 hours away from the life I’ve built, back into my moms house and completely dependent again until I recover from my surgery and am able to get a full time job. I’ve been independent for the last 2 years and I feel like such a scumbag if I end up back on my moms income. 

Idk, this is all a rant and there’s really no point to any of it. I guess I’m just heartbroken with myself for not living up to my own expectations.

108,"For the past two months, I have been waking up in a state of anxiety. My first thoughts are usually a panic about everything I need to do and how hard it is going to be and oh my god maybe I'll just jump into traffic and end it all. Yeah, those kinds of days. 

I reached a point where this feeling of anxiety and desperate need to be productive changed my attitude. I was negative toward myself and others; i found myself judging people as harshly as i was judging myself. I became totally self-absorbed by focusing on how bad I felt.

I started to go to therapy. At first, things didn't really click. Reason with my negative thoughts? Take back my power? What?

Over the past few days, however, something just clicked in me. I made a list of small goals I wanted to accomplish for the week. I didn't take on any 30 day challenges that would turn me into a different person, or make myself any grand promises. I simply gave myself a little guidance for the next week. 

Small goals I knew I could accomplish every day included: a morning routine in which i don't look at my phone as soon as i wake up, and instead journal for five minutes; meditate 5 minutes every day; and do something active every day. Setting these seemingly insignificant goals for myself has made me feel so accomplished each day that I have done them, and I have discovered a new, larger goal. I want to become mentally strong. 

I don't want to say that I am weak if I'm depressed. But I DO think that it makes me stronger if I challenge the thoughts that make me depressed. In many ways, I have allowed myself to be depressed by not even trying to fight the feeling. 

Part of me feels silly discovering that I have control over my attitude about things. Sometimes it's just easier to pretend that I don't.",17Apr2019,20

112,"So for the first time in a long while i guess, i have to admit that i'm actually starting to feel lonely. From 18-21 i was in 2 different long term relationships and each lasted like a year and a half or so. After the last one ended last year i went out with someone i really liked briefly but felt like i wasn't ready to get attached again and he wasn't looking for something exclusive at the time anyway. Bottom line, i'm finally properly all alone as an adult and I've always bragged about never relating to people who feel loneliness but here i am, i don't like it at all but i guess it's part of being human. It's a very interesting feeling to me as I'm well aware what it does to my mental health but I'm still learning how to deal with it, some nights are tough but i don't want to fill the void with temporary people. It's also a good time for me to really let myself grow, i haven't had that in so long and jesus christ, facing yourself and being outside of your comfort zone all alone as an adult is both a horrible and wonderful experience (at the end of the day after you're like, done crying).

I was wrong, so, so wrong.

I'm not happy, the better things get and the more of my survival anxieties that melt away as I make progress in the traditional sense the realer my underlying sadness becomes.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so alone, deeply alone and I have little hope of finding a lasting sense of connection. I see everything in my life as inherently fleeting. I know my family loves me, i'm horrified that i'll either die young or live long enough to lose my mother and my siblings and my family. I'm somewhere on the aromantic spectrum, i can fall in love but i find infatuation offputting. I limit myself greatly in my relationships because I hate feeling responsible for other peoples emotions, i feel wholey incapable of co-opting myself to live up to anyones expectations. I've lost a lot of friends to silence and the ones I still have feel impossible to connect with as humans because Im so distrustful and have a strong inclination towards self isolation in the face of uncertainty. 

&amp;#x200B;

I love everyone one a base level, I really just want the best for everyone but it is coupled with this internal sense of disappointment with the nature of our shared existence. I expect disappointment, I expect people to be less then who I think they could be, by no fault of their own just the nature of the world we live in. I feel like a crab in a barrel who happens to be standing on top of a lot of people who are under just as much pressure but i dot know how to escape. I dont want to die but I hate going through the motions. i know none of this is unique to me or new but i just feel like im stuck in a clusterfuck and the harder I try to cope and live within it the worst I feel, I want to check out of it all but I dont want to be one of the unseen homeless. I see to many homeless people that look like older versions of me. I feel to much pain radiating around me. I feel like I cant connect and when I do people expect the world from me and all I can do is disappoint them. I feel to much disdain in the mutual absence of an effort to communicate and i only see it getting worst. and the better I come to do the more weary I am of letting people in as I generally see people as self-serving to the point that we can fool ourselves into believing our lies.

&amp;#x200B;

I know its disjointed but I dont want to feel like this but i feel trapped and im tired of trying to communicate my pain as its infectious and exhausting. I feel perpetually unseen, like my characteristics proceed my humanity, I want nothing to do with people but cant live forever on my own, I dont want to make promises I dont think I can keep. I hate that the more privilege I amass the worst I feel about my pain, I wish I could cry myself to sleep like I used to. I wish I didn't have a weed problem, I'm glad I dont have an alcohol one. I feel so alone, now I have to work a 9-5 and act like it was all worth it, I owe it to my mom not to fall apart, not now, im so close yet the race to the future never ends the better day is always coming and I'm tired and sad and that sadness has ruined so much in my life. it just keeps going and i don't know what to do.",17Apr2019,1
117,"I've been in many sensitive situations, sensitive conversations. Risky things legally, reputationally, professionally, etc. I've been seeing a lot of people. My days are just constantly meeting people, participating in risky things. Most people I know are mentally ill in some form or another. I'm probably mentally ill. I'm happy though. Just stretched thin. 

I just want to stay home. Smoke (vape) weed. Watch Youtube. Do work. Learn. Eat healthy. Exercise. Live the good life.

Nothing could have prepared me for this life. 

Life is weird. Life is so risky. Much of this risk is unavoidable. Some is not. But much isn't. In a political system whatever you do is risky, even doing nothing is risky. 

I don't know. If people want me they can find me home. Or not. Leave a message.",17Apr2019,1

119,"Today was a cake walk, walking around with my cake spinning it like a top on my fingertip and eating it with glee.

I still hurt, all these angry words aren't all for nothing but they aren't helping me anymore. I can't forget that others are fragile like me, and they hurt too. I want to avoid causing more pain, and I don't need to carry so much bitterness to survive anymore. 

When I focus on others shortcomings I know it's often ones I share too. The drunk, the bad coworker, the narcissist, the cheat, the liar, and the thief, I've been them all. All else I can say is irrelevant, except that I'm going to try to be better and hope the same for others.",17Apr2019,1
120,"This feels like the end for me. The man I’ve looked up to all my life is now facing the end, and I don’t know what to do because he’s a huge part of me and who I am and I love him so much. Hoping to receive some words of wisdom to look up to",17Apr2019,1
121,"I've seen them on other people and I have one myself. And always wondered where the fuck it came from. And a few years ago I figured out it was a scar I got from when I was born. From a wide forceps tool used to grip a baby's head as they are being pulled out.

You're welcome.",17Apr2019,2
