0,"I’m just not been feeling it recently, my dog passing and the fear of growing up and being self-conscious of everything has just taken a toll on me, I wanna talk about it but I just talk to my self to the random people/voices I make in my head thinking that helps, but it doesn’t. I just don’t know if I need serious help or not, and it’s scary not knowing that",14Sep2019,1
1,"For the record, I had social anxiety for most of my teens and couldn't make friends. Although I would have fairly mainstream interests, I was branded a ""weird"" kid cos of my lack of friends and shyness. On some level I still feel like a loser cos I only have 400 followers on Instagram and I have no close friends other than my boyfriend and his friends. 

I decided to move into a house with 7 random fellow students I'd never met. I thought things were going well, a few of them added me on Instagram. However I sent follow requests to 2 of them today and they havent responded. I know they have been online cos they commented on a housemate's picture. I feel so embarrassed now. I thought they wanted to be friends. I had chatted to both of these roommates on several occasions, had a drink with them and done chores with them. Heck, one of them offered me some of his dinner and to give me lecture notes. Have I screwed things up already? I'm quite shy but I really pushed myself to befriend them. I can't help but worry they think I'm a loser or if I'm just paranoid.",14Sep2019,1
3,"For those of you who read my last post, I thank you for your support and advice. For those of you who didn't, I wrote about how I was, and still am, kind of a toxic person - and one person made me realize I had to change for the better. Turns out, it was too late to save our friendship. We haven't talked much lately, but things took a turn for the worse this week. He went from taking hours to answer my messages to our conversations not happening at all. I assume that we are probably fading away from each other...which I kind of saw coming. Our problems were just too deep, life got in the way, and in the end - he felt that our friendship was not worth saving. I understand completely why he chose to fade away, and I wanted you all to know that I still am actively trying to change...even though I no longer have the opportunity to save the friendship that made me want to change. If anything, it has made me realize even more that this change needs to happen. I am heartbroken that I wasn't able to change quick enough to save this friendship, but I am determined to never let my toxicity and neediness ruin another relationship. Thank you all for the support anyways!

5,"It's always been the same since I found drugs &amp; alcohol.

Step 1 get a vehicle or job.

Step 2 get the one you didn't get yet - vehicle/job.

Step 3 get a house with a private garden.

Step 4 get a nice shed or wendyhouse.

Step 5 get 3-8 dogs, the breeds are important.

Step 6 finish work and sit with my dogs getting high.

Step 7 bury them when they die.

Step 8 bury myself besides them.

It's always been the same, that's the dream, the only thing I can think of that is better, is doing the same thing but in a nice exotic country, a country that can be explored because it's vast. Exercise, explore, endure, enjoy.

I'm 26 and I have a job 1 dog no vehicle no garden no shed and I recently stopped smoking weed and drinking beer because - I just can't do anything when i'm smoking and drinking every night after work. It carries on to the next day - then you finish work and drink and smoke; it carries on to the next day -

You just live like a zombie pretty much.

I hope, in less than a year, I will have that vehicle.

12,"Hey everyone, I really want to get good at drawing, and I believe that such an ambition is best when I am held accountable for my decisions by corresponding with others as they pursue their own goals.

I propose a challenge. It isn’t based on any research or curriculum; if anything, it’s *somewhat* like John Maxwell’s Rule of 5 (will provide sauce at the end of this).

The rules are simple, but you must adhere to them no matter what, doing your best not to skip a single day of practice.

Step 1: Determine the skill you’d really like to be good or better at. Do not consider how difficult you think it will be to achieve.


Step 2: Every single day from today to this same time next year, devote a mere 2-5 minutes to building up your skill. In my case this would look like making one quick sketch per day. 


Step 3: Log your days and hours in a notebook or something, so that you may look at how far you’ve come from the beginning.


Step 4: Every week or so, ever so slightly, increase the difficulty of the skill you are practicing. Otherwise you will plateau and half your progress.

Let’s do this!

15,"My first degree and career was not the right career for me at all. I chose accounting, because of the job opportunities, steady money and I knew I could do it. But then I found programming/automation/computer science/auditing and I fell in love with the accounting/computer science hybrid career. Plus there isn't a lot of travel so I can come home to my daughter at night. And, if my husband did die, I would make enough for us to live comfortably on (this is important to me and so is the opposite, if I die, I want my husband to make enough for them to live comfortably on).

So I started my degree in computer science and so far everything makes perfect sense as I have been already applying it in my career...just not getting paid for it. And, to be completely honest, I hate my current job and am looking for positions to open up in my previous two jobs. But, I am trying to stay positive. This current job is funding my current degree and I estimate that I will pay off my house in the 10th year of owning it (on a 30 year mortgage where I was a stay at home mom for the first 2 and didn't make extra principal payments those first two years). My job was also 5 minutes away so I could easily transition my child from breastfeeding to normal food and from a nanny to daycare. The job has been somewhat flexible as well.  

But, it is hard, because this job is not great and I have worked at a couple of great places. They can't really keep people and are the type to ""advertise what a great culture"" they have to make up for their lack of pay (not including office workers). I do have decent coworkers, but, unfortunately, they do not understand computers and blame everything that goes wrong with the system on me (and it is a buggy system that lost support...we are going to upgrade, but after I said ""I hope this system upgrade fixes the bugs"", I was literally asked ""well what if it doesn't?""...yeah...). We also lack an IT department, so it isn't like there is outside support to at least explain some of these issues to them.

I am looking in my previous jobs for open positions, but I am not about to take another jump into another potential frying pan as I really need stability in my career - for my own personal life and resume. (I was a temp before I graduated, then voted an awesome job that I had to quit since baby refused a bottle and this job is the job where I am returning to the workforce).

Ugh...just need to get through this, get closer to my degree and land my dream job - hopefully at my last job, but really any company with a truly good culture will do. Then, I can return to my normal, happy self like I was in my last 2 jobs.",14Sep2019,2

21,"My (ex) boyfriend abruptly ended our 6.5 year relationship last night after he picked me up from work. Looking back I can see that we were both unhappy and at the end of the day it's a good thing. Theres just two things that I can't stop thinking about: my cats.
One of them we have had since the beginning of our relationship and the other we have had for 4 years, since she was a baby. I love them both as if they were my actual children. 
Every morning when I would wake up the youngest one, Dust, would demand affection and follow me around the house until I would sit down to eat my breakfast. Then she would wedge herself in between my food and my mouth for pets. 
The older one, Cow, would not let you use the bathroom by yourself. She pretended to be skittish, but is actually just a coy little shit. 
I don't want to traumatize them by moving them against their will and I don't want to separate them either. My ex said that he would keep one and I would keep the other, but never specified which I would take. And I am living with my dad in my childhood home who I'm not sure he would be okay with taking in a cat. 
I just finished moving and I couldn't even say goodbye to them because I would end up breaking down for hours, like I'm doing now. My days will be so much sadder without their little meows and pitter patters on the laminate. Honestly I would have stayed years unhappy in that relationship just so I could keep being with them.

22,"So I (31m) went shopping for an engagement for my (24f) girlfriend with her mom last week. The center stone is a family heirloom so I lucked out not having to buy the stone. I really wanted to use it but felt that it was really limiting my options... 

I decided to go with it because I knew it would have a sentimental meaning and to her that's more important. This rock turned out to be a fairly good size (1.5 carat) and great quality. It's a round brilliant, SV2 clarity, H color, excellent cut for you diamond people. 

Because I did not have to purchase a center stone I decided to splurge on the band and engagement ring setting. Platinum with 28 pave set diamonds totaling another 1.3 carats of equal quality. 

I got appraisal today, $20,500. I know the price doesn't matter and I'm not trying to brag. 

When I meet her I had nothing to offer, less than 3 years later I am happy to say she'll get a ring she deserves. I have told everyone I know but I'm still so excited to give her something I never thought I could that I had to come on here. She's perfect.",14Sep2019,1

Our brain is very complex, anything we say ends up ""coming true"", It is psychology. I'll try to explain in an easier way, just imagine: You wake up early in the morning, tired and from the millisecond you wake up, your head starts thinking a thousand things and you soon think: ""This day will be horrible, I will only find with annoying people and it will be stressful"" unconsciously yourself makes your day horrible because you said it would be and at the end of the day it gets stressed because you said it would be. So if you try to be positive, even if you don't believe it yourself, your brain will.

I have to keep reminding myself that this feeling with pass. I’m lying in bed on a Saturday night and all I want to do is end it all. I’m having intrusive thoughts of going behind my house which has train tracks and waiting for the train to do its nightly route and jumping in front of it. I have thoughts of jumping off a building. Thoughts of pointing a gun to my head and pulling the trigger. Thoughts of swallowing so many pills that I’ll be able to sleep forever. I have thoughts of driving my car into a ditch and flipping.  I have thoughts of pretending to play baseball and hitting the ball so damn hard. 

I’m mentally tired of these intrusive thoughts of killing myself. I love my support system so very much and I wish I could tell them these things. I just feel so guilty and I know that they’ll want to help me think positive. I just can’t. 

I don’t want to be here anymore. I don’t want to do this anymore. I don’t want to take medicine. I don’t want to have to see a therapist. I don’t want to have to see a psychiatrist. I never asked to be damaged so young. I never asked for my father to touch me. I never asked for my mother to put me in comfortable situations with me and I didn’t ask for her to emotionally and physically abuse me. I didn’t ask for her husband at the time to molest me. I didn’t ask for the rape in high school or the rape in college. I don’t ask for my ex boyfriend to emotionally abuse me so bad, so very bad. I didn’t ask for any of it.   

This shit is so fucking hard to deal with and to process. It’s so fucking hard to maintain my relationships with other people. This is the many reasons why I isolate. 

But I know that this feeling will pass because I have so much good in my life. I am doing such great things. I love so many people and I love so many things. 

Right now, in this moment I’m scared. I’m terrified. I’m hurt. I’m angry. I’m full of so many emotions. Emotions that only I have to deal with because putting my emotional baggage on my boyfriend or best friend isn’t fair. They shouldn’t have to worry about me. They deserve good things and good people. I love them deeply, I love them so much that I don’t want to vent and tell them that I just want to die. It’ll seem like a cry for help. I don’t want sympathy, I’m getting help. I’m seeking help. 

Right now, I’m not doing so well. I’m hurting bad. That’s why I’m in therapy. That’s why I take medication. It gives me hope that one day I’ll stop hurting and I’ll be healed and won’t think about suicide every night before bed.

35,"This is going to be a bit of a rant, so just a warning.

Anyways, I’m not an attractive person. I have tried every dating app using different pictures, bios, everything, and I try really hard in real life with going to the gym and all of that fun stuff, and yet I get almost nothing. I not only get almost no matches, but nobody is even liking me in the first place (some apps like okcupid and tinder show the amount of people that swipe right or “like” you). When I do message the few  girls I actually match with I’m met with no response or just boring responses with barely any effort put in. In the real world, I get no attention from girls and I almost never notice them looking at me.

My personal experience proves I am not a good looking man. That’s fine. It’s disappointing but it’s whatever. The problem I have is when my family and friends insist on saying I am good looking, handsome etc. when it’s clear I am not. Why should I believe them? I’ve done everything I can to better myself it feels like and it’s not enough. Even my therapist said I was being harsh on myself and said I was attractive. I’m not saying any of this to brag because I know none of it is true. My entire life experience contradicts this.

I think the whole “everyone is beautiful” thing is so dangerous. I know people that say that have good intentions but it’s such a dangerous thing to say. Not everyone is attractive. It’s not cool to lie to people, you’re just going to bring them down even lower when they realize it’s not true. Thankfully for me I was always skeptical when I was complimented on my looks but it’s not the case for everyone. I wish people could be more upfront and honest, even if it may be hard because the truth isn’t always ideal.

I don’t hold anything against anyone who lies to me about my looks. I know they want what’s best for me and that they care about me. I just wish they could be honest. I’ve struggled with low self esteem and a negative view of my appearance my whole life, I don’t need people telling me things they think I want to hear. I am a 24 year old man, I can handle brutal honesty. I wish we could be more honest as a society and tell people that they are more than just their looks, that every human has value no matter what they look like.

41,"Feeling a little lost lately (actually for a long while now) and just kind of hoping to find some solace in not being alone. Heck, maybe I am alone, but with 7 billion people on Earth it's unlikely that my feelings are unique and no one has the same experience.


Most people seem to have a myriad of things that make them happy. Things that fulfill them. And I... Don't. I just don't have that. I have hobbies, and they're good, they're things I enjoy doing to pass the time. I like horror films, riding my motorcycle down winding back roads, fixing things, heck, I even like my job even though it's super dead end.


I have a handful of good friends. A lot of acquaintances, and I'm fortunate to be one of those people who can get along with just about anyone I meet. I have an adoring partner in my life who cares greatly for me and would give up her happiness for my own. I'm a lucky person. 


And yet I don't find happiness in any of this. There's one thing that makes me actually happy to the core. One thing that actually makes me feel fulfilled and whole and gives me purpose.  And just nothing else matters because without it I just feel hollow.  Yes, that's a bit of hyperbole, because I do care about things, but in the grand scheme of things just barely. I care about the one thing that makes me happy, and I try to make my big life decisions around it, and it's probably the only thing that gives me any amount of motivation to even live. 


I live where I do because I hope it will have an impact on what I want, despite the fact that it's hot all the time out here and the whole state is over-priced. I'm trying to get a really well paying job in a field I don't care about because I think it will be an asset.  I'm at the tail end of four years in school for the well paying job I don't care about and am in debt up to my eyeballs for it, same reason.  I've improved my credit score, paid off 90% of tens of thousands of dollars in credit card debt in the past three years because I think it will help.


I have a singular driving force, a singular source of happiness, a singular source of peace, singular reasoning for my actions and decisions. And when it isn't working... I just... Don't have anything.. I can't find happiness, motivation, peace. I can't find it in myself to do anything beyond the minimum. And yes, I'm sure some of it is depression, but a lot of it really just is I don't have what I need to be happy or whole. 


And I can't help but wonder if I'm alone in being so wholly dependent on a singular facet of life for my happiness. ",14Sep2019,3

48,"I have a friend who we’ve become close as hell. Im 16 and she’s 14, but I got raised in a pretty much “raise yourself” type place. My parents are here and they help me grow sure, but I didn’t want to grow up with their values (They’re homophonic as shit, Pro life, just in general pricks). So, personally I believe myself a bit maturer than average. I met her through the Internet when I joined a Discord server for fun. We got close, I had a GF at the time so it didn’t become romantic, but instead it let us get even closer. I found out she didn’t have a Dad, ad since she was young, I decided to why not give it  try and try to fill in her father figure spot. I don’t do much other than like, give dad advice and be proud of her and stuff. Today, Her Grandparents called her trash and want her to quit doing an after school activity. She got really sad and even started cutting herself. I was just there chatting with her trying to comfort her. Her Boyfriend (He’s a good guy) is panicking and I’m fearing the worst. She said she was going to try the razor on her throat, and the last message I got from her for now was, “My Throat”.

I don’t know what to do. She has a special place in my heart as basically family and I’m starting to break down. Her Bf already lost it. She hasn’t responded to any of us. She lives in a pretty much 3rd world country so, she couldn’t really get a therapist, and according to her, her school counselor isn’t good. Just saying that incase anyone asked.

49,"I'm a young professional (24M) who has recently had some success in career and earning respectfully in my circle. I like my job, the people around me are nice and I have a crush with and things are looking hopeful with her. Previously, I've had an year long of depression because I was faring badly in both my personal &amp; professional life and it took a lot of effort to get out of it. However, I'm finding myself more anxious &amp; tense everyday than the day before, everyday. It has got nothing to do with work because I barely have any stress at work. I'm being on the edge for a lot of time, specifically after work and I've observed that my heart starts pounding&amp; I become really uncomfortable. Recently it happened on my commute back from work and I almost had an irrational panic attack, for no reason. Also, in tbe past there were two major instances in my life wherein some big bad news came to me almost immediately after I had some good, memorable times, thus Conditioning me to the anticipate that something bad is coming to me, now that I'm having some good times. 

I keep reading about how the world around us is getting corrupt &amp; brazen everyday, (be it the HK protests, the US politics, the Amazon fires the looming recession or any thing related to global warming), and all of it affects me a lot &amp; I feel very helpless. While some people might say that I need to fight against the things that bother me, I felt that it would be only futile and won't change anything. I live in a very congested city and I keep getting overwhelmed by all the people Al&amp; the rush around me. Yesterday night, before bed time, I've read an article on how the world's richest are isolating themselves everyday from the rest of the world, both physically &amp; metaphorically, and that affected me a lot. Overall I feel that there's nothing to be hopeful for, in the future and there's a sense gloom that descends over me whenever I think about my future. Also, up until recently, I never used to dream at all and lately, it's been a series of nightmares that while don't jolt me awake, just keep making me anxious &amp; edgy even in my sleep.  

And I have realised that my happiness in a day has become very contingent on how my work goes that day and how my interactions with the people around me happen that day. If my works goes a little bad that day, or if I didn't get to interact with a few of my friends because they were busy, I immediately become paranoid thinking that I might not be fit for this job or that my friends no longer want to hang out with me. And this is a new phenomena because up until recently, I've always been happy by myself and never had to look for my professional life for happiness.

I've considered &amp; rejected going to a counselor because the idea of trusting &amp; opening up to a counselor sounds very exhausting. I sometimes drop hints to my friends about how I'm feeling to see anyone of them is willing to listen, but then o again stop myself because I don't want to scare them away by opening up the avalanche onto them.",14Sep2019,2

And that one time where I wrote a story, then suggested we should write a story each week, which lasted for only 2 weeks lmao. But it was fun.
Or that time when she comforted me at my lowest low.

And all of it could have been avoided if I simply chose to understand her. (I won't get into it lmao. Too long and too complicated to explain)

51,"I (M 16) have become recently aware of a sensation that I have felt for over a year now. Sensation may not be the best word, but there it is. 

I overheard somebody  talking about how people are meant to feel touch from another human and those who don't feel even just friendly animal touch for extended periods can go insane and so on. 

Validity aside, this got me thinking. I havn't dated anyone for 2-odd years now and generaly am to afraid to be super social. Sure, I have my close friend circle, but I feel estranged from them often. This all culminates with my realisation: I am longing for physical attention. Not to say sexual attention. For example, I hugged a friend today and it was bliss. Purely relief like I have not felt in a long time. I held my co-worker's hand as part of a joke we were making and I almost couldn't let go.

My worry is that this makes me a creep or a perv. I don't really feel sexual towards much anyone but I DO crave sitting next to someone just to feel them next to me.

My questions are such: Does anyone understand this? Can you relate? Am I a creep?

Tl,dr: I crave touch but non sexual. It brings reliefto my anxiety. Am I weird?

60,"Hi everyone,

My past experiences lead me to believe that I am definitely not attractive. People have told me that I have a good personality and I know that people say that looks aren’t the “end all be all” but I can’t help but feel... undesirable? I’ve never had a member of the opposite sex show the slightest interest in me (and no I’m not oblivious). I’ve always been told by family to lose weight; however, I struggle a lot with food. When I try to lose weight, I restrain myself to a strict clean diet and then I end up binging. The guilt is the worst part because there’s a voice in my head that tells me that I’ll never be attractive until I lose 50 pounds. I don’t want to feel this way anymore. I want to be okay with not being conventionally attractive. Personally, I don’t see why we must put so much importance into physical appearance but due to the way others treat me, it makes me feel like people value looks over personality. Even my mom tells me that I am not attractive. Maybe it’s just that the people I’m around are toxic but my self esteem has taken a serious hit in the past year. It’s to the point that I don’t want to go out because I feel so ugly. 

I’m stepping out of my comfort zone tomorrow and going to a clubbing event but honestly? I’m absolutely terrified that people might treat me like... I’m nothing. I know this sounds like a long pathetic rant (and it is) but can anyone give me tips on how to feel better about myself and tips for how to handle that club event?",14Sep2019,1

I went clubbing tonight with some friends and I was in a good mood. I never go because I’m pretty shy but love dancing. Usually when I go I just dance with my friends Today I saw some girls dancing next to me different times and asked them casually if they’d like to dance in my group or a drink. One girls said no which is completely fine but some of them just put their hands in my face and had a disgusted look on their face. 

I understand that means nothing but it made me feel shitty about myself especially when I saw them dancing with other guys right after. I’m not fishing for anything and I understand most of this is pretty childish but I have pretty shit self esteem and now I just feel like I’m so ugly to everyone, even my gf who never really compliments or talks about me.

63,"I need to speak a little to somebody.
My family and friends has always listened to me when I need to talk but I fear to bother them so here I am!
Back in 2015 I dated a guy and it was one of my biggest mistakes. From then on followed 2 years of various abuses, and it basically ended one night when he hitted me so hard I had to go to hospital.
Anyway, I was scared of him and of people in general. He harassed me and I called his mom in a desperate call for help, she stopped him from contacting me and basically solved the whole problem herself. (I tried calling the police and everything but they never listened/helped me even though I have 3 reports from the hospital and 2 other doctors..) 
After the whole break-up/harassment thing, as I felt confident and secure with my new college friends, my family was very present to help, I lived the BEST year of my life, I gained back all my lost confidence and probably even more, I was so confident I wasn't afraid to approach men and had some one night stands.
But, maybe in January-February of this year I started to feel a bit lonely, even if I was still surrounded by the love of my family and friends.
I tried dating apps but no men really caught my eyes and I stopped maybe 2 months later. 
But when I was done with college I tried to log back into tinder and I matched with a guy. He was funny and we decided to meet... I instantly felt good with him, everything was so natural, so we decided to meet again, and again... And decided to date!
He knows about my past and is sorry about that but it's never really in his everyday life but.. I sometimes freak out during certain situation, he's super comprehensive and stays calm, help me as best as he can, in our every day life he sometimes reassures me just by being natural. 
My best examples are when he supports my ideas, doesn't tell me that it's stupid, looks at me as if I'm just too beautiful for this world, he helps me around the house and fix my broken things, just so I live better in my new apartment. 
Little by little I feel worthy of love, loved, like I belong in the world, like I'm not disposable, I'm a lot less nervous thanks to him and yeah...
I just wanted to pay him a little tribute
Recognize everything his brings me, all the joy, the well-being, the true sens of love, a fear-less space!

If anybody has an idea of how I could thank him for everything, I'm listening! I already tell him from time to time why I love him (he has a looooot more qualities than ""just"" helping me). I try my best to be by his side when he's feeling bad, but I'd like to do something special!",14Sep2019,2
64,"I'm so upset and depressed that I'm just shaking.

I just don't even know what to do anymore and I know the situation I'm in is all my fault.

I fucked up, he said he needed me, he needed support, he was being abused and he was suicidal, cutting himself, hitting himself... and I caved. 

I answered him.

I wanted to help him... because I still love him.

Now I'm the bad guy again, talking to the taken guy, and his girlfriend isn't abusive anymore, ""she was in the past but now she's different!!""

What made it even worse was he said he didnt want to hurt anyone in this situation, he just wants everyone to be happy.

But that can't happen, he knows it can't, and so I told him the obvious thing he needs to do, just hurt me and be with the person he loves, I don't matter anymore and that's okay.. 

Yet, he pushed and told me that I did, that even his girlfriend would think I mattered and I need to say it too.

But how do I tell the person who I'm trying to help get through what I thought was abuse that the reason why I feel like I dont matter is because I'm still recovering from abuse myself, not any abuse, but the years of abuse he put me through? That I have a diagnosed disorder because of him... that my friends, family, and therapist all would kill me if they knew I answered his plea... that the whole time we were ""together"" that I felt worthless, useless, and like I was thr abusive one...

I'm just causing myself mental anguish at this point, letting the love I have for him cloud my judgment, hoping for a future where he ""isn't abusive anymore!!"" as well. I just wish I could move forward from him.. maybe it's because he used me emotionally up until the point where he hook up with his current gf or maybe I'm just stuck on the stupid idea of true love... I don't know...

But I do know I have never felt this alone, hurt, and depressed in my life.. 
Maybe I'll feel better in the morning, but right now I'm just so very low and upset, mostly at myself for leading myself down a path of hurt again..",14Sep2019,1

I took a rip (i smoke usually for my anxiety and stomach issues, i used to use weed more but then stuff was getting in the way so carts became more convenient) and i instantly knew something was wrong. I had a weird sensation in my mouth that traveled down to my throat, and then it felt like something had an iron fist around my lungs. At first i was trying to be calm, i thought i was overthinking and it was the anxiety kicking in but it got worse. i went to bed with the worst stomach ache, woke up in the middle of the night sweating my ass off but i was colder than an ice cube. i knew something was severely wrong but i was scared, this never ever happened to me. I went to college the following morning and i felt a little bit better (maybe because i was trying to not think about it), the second i went to my first class i had this burning sensation in my lungs and chest area. i genuinely thought i was going to die. i had to get rushed to the doctor and they had to run a bunch of damn tests (the vitamin e oil made fat bubbles in my lungs, hence the horrible breathing patterns and sickness) i didn’t want to become a statistic, another dumb teen (im 19) ends up in the hospital over poor judgement. im glad i threw the cart out the second i felt horrible and didn’t continue to use it like most people are doing (go on r/fakecartridges r/oilpens youll know what im talking about). here i am a few days later, steroids, nebulizer, GERD medicine (somehow i got this from it, idk the connection but having both of those things at the same time is the worst) and i lost 10 pounds within 4-5 days. please be careful, i didnt tell anyone close this stuff (besides my parents and some close friends) but that doesnt mean YOU shouldnt. be careful with life because one day you can be the happiest man on the planet and then the next day you could be on the verge of death. its hard to type all of this, especially since i have 60% lung capacity, i get all choked up and it messes with my breathing lol. just be safe everyone, life is short live it up. also if you have carts be careful and know where the source is. send carts to a lab if you want to see what you’re inhaling.",14Sep2019,377

76,"This story starts in the summer of 2013. I'm just a 22 year old dude who's still slightly hungover from one of the best parties I had ever attended. I get a text from my friend Frankie. He tells me he's worried about our friend Chad. Tells me he thinks Chad is considering suicide. “Pfft! What?” I think to myself. Chad is my best friend. What kind of nonsense is Frankie talking about? What, just because he hasn't been able to contact him for less than a day Chad's suicidal? I find this idea is so preposterous I immediately call Chad, but probably not for the reasons you'd expect.   
    
The phone rings and it goes to voice mail, but am I worried? Not in the slightest. I leave a voicemail. “Hey man, if you get this don't call or text Frankie. I got an idea.” Of course my idea was to keep Frankie sweating about the idea that Chad's committed suicide. Yeah, I know it's a jackass move, but I was an idiot. I keep texting with Frankie and he tells me how Chad's fiancee hasn't been able to get a hold of him either and when she went to his apartment he wasn't answering the door. He tells me she could hear music being played loudly on the other side of the door and that little detail triggers a flashback within me that fills me with dread. A memory that takes me from thinking “Frankie, you're an idiot” to “my best friend Chad is likely dead.”   
    
Over six years earlier Chad and I were hanging out on Myspace, staying up late on a school night and chatting about who knows what. He was drinking, getting drunk while listening to Jimi Hendrix. As the night goes on and he gets more and more intoxicated he starts to tell me how tonight's the night he ends it. How he's going to join Jimi Hendrix in the after life and it's all going to be great. His words terrify me and cause me to sneak out of my house at two in the morning and skate all the way across town to where he lives. I get to his house sometime past 3 and sneak in through the sliding glass door in the back that his mom never locks.   
    
I find Chad passed out on his bed, the projector in his room playing footage of Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock shredding away at one of his guitar solos, music cranked to the max. It's a relief to find that my friend isn't hurt and I find myself feeling somewhat embarrassed that I actually thought my friend was going to kill himself. I leave and put that night behind me, thinking it was just the booze talking and something that would never be brought up again.   
    
Frankie and I were in the car together, on our way to Chad's place, now both of us concerned for Chad's safety. Chad lived over forty minutes away, most of that time spent on the freeway. We were about halfway there when Frankie gets a text. Frankie looks at his phone and stays silent. “What's it say,” I ask. He doesn't say anything. “What's it say,” I repeat. Frankie barely chokes out the words “he's dead.”   
    
I remember not knowing how to feel or act when I got the news. I pulled the car over on the side of the freeway and got out and walked away from the car. Both Frankie and I cried, though I feel like I cried in that moment more as an act for Frankie than from actual sadness. The magnitude of what had happened hadn't hit me yet and in less than five minutes I was wiping my tears away and heading back to the car.   
    
A week later I didn't cry at the funeral. I remember feeling guilty for it, but even then it all still hadn't hit me.   
    
Chad's suicide cast me into a depression that lasted years. I was enveloped in pain and anguish like nothing I had ever experienced. I turned my phone off for months at a time and stopped talking with friends. Living with my parents allowed me to lock myself away in my room and isolate myself away from everyone and everything. My mind took me to dark, dark places. It was a humbling experience, but not one I would wish upon anyone.   
    
I eventually sought out help and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and given some drugs to help stabilize my mood. I eventually stopped taking the drugs, but never fell back into depression, at least not that same dark place I was desperate to escape from. Today, depression is more like laziness, if it were some kind of sickness that would come and go. The depression I feel today doesn't hurt like it did when it was really bad and feels more like an inconvenience.   
    
I feel like my time spent alone has affected me in some seriously negative ways. I talked so infrequently that my voice has actually deteriorated. Most of the friends I once had I now no longer talk to anymore (and don't desire to, even today). I spend most of my time watching YouTube or playing video games and the only friends I talk to are the ones who play games with me.   
    
I don't take pleasure from social interactions and I feel anxious in crowded areas. I don't desire human interaction almost at all and am completely comfortable spending most of my time in my head. I've worked a couple of jobs over the last couple of years, but blah... Is it really worth it?     
    
I have only ever had one girlfriend and that was in 8th grade. I ended up dumping her because I couldn't reciprocate the feelings she held towards me. Since then (around 15 years) I've declined any romantic advances (which there have been a few) as the idea of love feels like some foreign concept to me. I don't feel like I've ever actually loved and I don't really hold any desire to experience it. Because of this I've never had sex (which I'm not ashamed of) partly because I feel like it's too much work to court a woman just to have sex when I can instead just masturbate and find satisfaction that way.   
    
I'm not suffering, but I'm not living either and I'm okay with that and this makes me feel like some kind of living anomaly. What's wrong with me? Are there others who feel this way?

I usually get one or two responses to messages I sent from him and then he's offline for a day or two.

79,"Cue Kip from Napoloean Dynamite...”I guess you could say things are getting pretty serious.”

So I know I’m falling for the oldest trick in the book and he only flirts because I tip well but after chasing my ex around it’s nice to pretend. 

I’ve been going to this restaurant regularly for the past few months and on occasion have had this waiter that isn’t my type but for some reason I find super cute and charming. He’s always attentive and outgoing which I find attractive. 

A few weeks ago, I went in and while he wasn’t my server, he made it a point to come over and say hi and ask how things were. He lamented that he hadn’t gotten to wait on my table and spent the night coming over every so often to make his presence known. When I left that night, he happened to be standing in the doorway and wished me a good night and said he hoped to see me back.

Last night, I went back (the food is good...don’t judge) and I saw waiting tables in another section. As I was walking out, we happened to cross paths and he smiled and said “hey!” before giving me a huge hug and telling me how he could have sworn he saw me at a local grocery store but was too shy to say hi. He asked where I was heading next and since I’m the worst at flirting, I replied “home.” We made a few more minutes of small talk and then I headed out after he told me to be sure to ask for him next time we came in.

I know it’s super cheesy and obviously he just does it for the tips but I liked it 🤷🏻‍♀️",14Sep2019,1
80,"My boyfriend had two edible gummies on my night stand table for at least a month, maybe two or more. They have just been sitting there amongst some loose change. Neither my cat or my dog has ever messed with them. Last night I invited my grandmother to spend the night with me, her and I fell asleep on my couch watching tv. My boyfriend came over once he got off work and we went to bed in my bed. This morning when we wake he gets ready to leave as he has to go kayaking with his work group today. A little before he is to leave he asks me what happened to the gummies. I go to look and they aren’t there. The change is still there but the gummies are just gone. I haven’t a clue where they could of gone. Before last night the only two people who have been in my house is me and my SO. My grandmother says she hasn’t touched them or seen them. I’ve looked all around the night stand, under the bed, all over the floor and can not find them. He then accuses me of having another person over and cheating and that whoever I’ve been cheating with took them. He has taken all of his things from my house and I’m still trying to find them. My pets had never bothered with them before but if they have eaten them neither pet is acting abnormal. I have no clue as to where they could have gone. I’m just dumbfounded by this whole ordeal and don’t even know what to do from here. I thought maybe it was possible that I threw them away and simply forgot, but I went through all the trash, and haven’t found them. I don’t know what to do from here.

81,"I (14F) live with my parents and my brother (19M). My family is pretty comfortable talking about sex because our parents wanna make sure that we make safe, consensual decisions. So, today, my brother started asking a lot of questions about sex and the probability of people getting pregnant and whatnot. It seemed a little suspicious, but I didn't think much of it. So, we all ended up having a conversation about STDs and being safe. But just now, after all of that, my dad called my brother to drive him to a pharmacy cuz his throat was apparently hurting and he needed some medicine. Call it instinct, but I had a feeling that that wasn't what was happening. They came back home empty-handed and immediately headed upstairs to my parents bedroom. I followed behind them and walked in, but it felt like they were waiting for me to leave. I eventually did leave and they immediately closed the door behind me. I wish my curiosity didn't get the better of me, but it did. I stayed back a little and listened through the door. I was just worried that something bad had happened to my brother that they were keeping from me. But what I ended up hearing was a conversation about something that had happened yesterday when my brother was with his girlfriend (19F). I didn't listen for long, but from what I pieced together, it seems like he lost his virginity yesterday. I wish I were one of those cool sisters that would be chill about this, but I'm kinda freaking out. This is my bubby here. It just... I dunno, it feels weird. This same kid that makes weird noises while he eats to make me laugh also apparently has had sex. I'm glad he's telling my parents and not trying to hide it, but he sounded pretty freaked out about it. I just need to vent a lil, and I just wanna feel not-weird again...

87,"In all honesty, I thought it would be me to kill myself. I often fell asleep to the thought of going through with it like it had become frighteningly comforting. Anytime something in my life happened that would break my heart or hurt me in some way, my first thought was always, ""Don't worry, you can just kill yourself."" 

But why did I feel this way? It's actually a lot of things and it's a lot that is still present in my life at the age of 30. I grew up with an Italian-American mother and Italian-American grandparents. The problem was, my last name is very Jewish. My father's parents or possibly his grandparents had changed their name and it was passed down. My father never took on the Jewish faith and doesn't really know what he is as far as ethnicity, saying that maybe he is Ashkenazi. My father only recently came back into my life after about 15 years and before that, he was only in and out sporadically. This meant that all I knew was my Italian side of the family...except that never mattered to people. Other Italian kids would bully me hard for being a kyke and never truly accepted me. Jewish kids didn't consider me to be one of them either. This left me in a sort of limbo in terms of identity but that wasn't the only side effect of having this last name. I am not treated like a human being. Often times people would give me negative criticisms very readily and usually it has something to do with the whole ""Jew"" thing. I'm not taken seriously and it's always been viewed as uncool to hang out with me, so I have no friends. So I just so happen to have curly hair, which I inherited from my mom's side of the family as my great uncle and grandfather from Naples had very curly hair like mine. But Italians don't have curly hair, apparently. I hid it for years and now have it grown out because I'm sick of being ashamed of it. This also makes me a target because only Jews have curly hair.


So what's this have to do with my brother? He dealt with all the same bullshit and felt like he was treated like this sub-human trash. We've never deserved it but that's just how things are. It doesn't matter that we're confirmed Catholics, our identity is Jewish and that identity will be condemned. It's even gotten us physically jumped before. Yes, we've actually been physically hurt for no other reason than, ""How dare these kykes pretend to be anything but?"" Sprinkle a ton of other stuff like our shitty home life (like a shitty mother who never made us feel like these people were wrong to treat us this way) and my brother is gone this last February. He was the only one who truly understood the pain and he's gone. Now I feel like limbo is laughing back at me because that's all I fucking am in life is a joke. 

The thing is, I want to live. I want to like life and be a part of a group of good people but I've truly lost hope. I fear that my life will end by my own hand just like my brother.",14Sep2019,2
88,"Hi, I'm new on reddit but I was interested and informed by this site and concept. I don't know if a lot of people are going to be interested by my post, but it's principally an exutory for me. And I don't know if it's the better place for it on reddit. If it'snt the case, go telling me (btw I'm not originally an english speaker, so sorry for my potentially bad English - I'm french-).
Maybe it would be a good thing for help me and a lot of other people.

For the beginning and to understand who I am and what's this post : I'm around twenty, I'm a big smoker (of cigarettes, I've been a big smoker of weed but that's an other story) since I'm 15 years old, I have a common history of a complicated family (divorced parents, a very few members of my family,...). I have a common history of life path, but I think in the depths of my mind, I have a big depression. Like it's in the title, I have psoriasis since I'm around 14 years old. I don't know why and all of doctors I seen don't know why I have that. For people who search what's psoriasis, I have it in the form of patches on the skin : all in my face, behind my ears, inside of my ears, on the head (under my hairs), and some small patches all around my body. I'm not very comfortable with it, and it seems to appear after a big trauma (that's a very bad summary, for more information, go search on web).
The reason why that I make this post is simple : I don't remember what it could be like trauma that make me this psoriasis. All doctors (I repeat it) don't know, my parents too, my friends too. Why have I this inclination for depression like that, and I didn't say it before but because of my curiosity, I tried different drugs (since I'm 18 - 19 years old but not in a hard use of it, that was just for try and it was never for extended use, I was never dependent of this kind of shit), and no one of these could calm down my pain. I already tried alcohol (btw I'm not alcoholic, I'm not drinking every day, I haven't this need to drink, and that's the same for drugs, unless nicotin).

So,I didn't say all these things for necessarily having answers, I know you guys aren't necessarily doctors. But I try to have some minds of you about all of it. And if there is anyone like in my case, I like to express yourselves about it and talk about it.

THAT'S NOT A TROLL OR SOMETHING ELSE.

So a few days ago I’ve decided to talk to her. Told her my name, she told me hers. Chatted for a bit.

Today I’ve took the courage to leave my number to her. I’ve asked if she was okay with that, and she told me “sure”.

It’s been a few hours and I know she’s still working right now, so maybe I’ll hear from here later today.

Like I said, yes I'm all for feminism and girl power, but sometimes I think these big artists forget that the goal is equality, not having the roles reversed. 
And sometimes they just make it look as if men are the ""inferior"" sex if you like, when that's just double standards and backwards thinking really.

98,"(Crosspost from r/abusiverelationships, hope it fits here too)

Hi there! To summarize my situation,  I left my abusive ex-boyfriend back in June. After the breakup there were suicide threats, harassment from him and his crazy mother, blackmail, shaming. I had to block him everywhere, and so did my family because he would not stop.

I do not regret leaving him, I do not miss him. That relationship lasted 2 and a half years. Now I am recovering, I got help from my family and psychologist.

I am wondering if there are things that could help me recover more quickly. I started art school a few weeks ago, so that’s making me feel better. I got some good friends on my side, and I started good coping habits, like working out, cleaning up things in my house, doing a proper skin care routine instead of bad ones like self-harming or eating lots of junk. That, I’m very happy about :)

Honestly, I am scared of my ex and his mother. I am certain that they have mental problems, and I know I would freak out if I saw one of them. I actually think they could try to hurt me physically or yell insults at me. Right now I am taking care of myself, and it feels so great 

There is no way I will ever be friends with him. He did some really bad stuff.

So, is there a way for me to heal faster/better? I know that I do not want to be in a relationship right now because I know I’d be a bit paranoid and look for signs of abuse everywhere. Or, maybe letting time pass is the only was to heal completely now. Advice is welcome :)",14Sep2019,1

119,"Hi. Sorry if this is not written out well or seems a bit all over the place, I'm an emotional wreck right now and felt was so sick of myself so here I am, asking for help.

I think, no, I know I'm a toxic person. And it's affecting my self esteem,  my behavior and relationships with people. I'm scared it'll be the cause of the end of my relationship with my boyfriend. To start with the issues I have : my boyfriend has a huge group of friends, they're all married, and they've all known each other since they were kids. They're pretty tight and while I admire their relationship, I am also extremely insecure about it. I'm an introvert. I have few friends, 2 maybe that I'm really close to and others that I can have a meaningful conversation  with. I'm almost always on the quiet side, I could also come off as shy. So hanging with the boyfriends friend who are so full of energy and draining takes a toll on me. There is no one I can find something in common with nor that I would like to strike a conversation with. Most times I have a beer or two to be able to get through the hangout. I can get really talkative when I'm a wee bit tipsy. I don't like having to do this. I'm really insecure about this. His best friends are this couple who are the loudest in the group. And I know he would have loved it if I would just act normal or hang with them in a normal way. But I can't. And this seems to make me feel even more insecure. He was in a relationship with his ex for about five years. This is something else that makes me feel uncomfortable as well. I'm constantly wondering if his friends are judging me, comparing me to her, that she was fun to be around with etc. I'm very insecure about this. There has been times when they bring up stories where they all hung out or went on vacations together and they'd mention her causally in the story. It kills me everytime.  One of his friends got married recently and at their party, they were screening group photos of all of them together. The ex was in that picture. With his hands over her. That wrecked me inside as well. I know these are things that are silly and stupid but I seem to not be able to get over it. These days I get jealous when he hangs around with his friends and doesn't spend time with me. Right now we're doing long distance and we're not able to spend much time together as we used to do. I feel like he prioritizes his friends over me. Which leads me to rethinking every single time we've been together on dates. He'd want his friends to be involved as well. Most of the time he'd give them a call and ask what they're up to and then ask me if it's okay if they come and hang with us or whatever. At the moment, I don't think much but later it hurts when I think about it.

I've told him about all this. How it affects me. He says he understands and we'll work on it together.
I...just want him to be happy. He's everything I've wanted. Most days I'm surprised I have in my life. He is kind, empathetic and loves me. He is communicative as well. But lately because of my toxic behavior, he's been scared to tell me if he hung out with his friends, or just about  life in general. 

I want to change, I've been trying, I thought I learned my mistakes from my previous relationship and would act accordingly. But it feels like I'm a lost cause and I'm losing my boyfriend. It hurt me when he told me he's scared to tell me things now. And then there's this other side that goes like dear god what is he not telling me what is he holding back. 

I can't live with myself like this. I need to change. I just can't do it by myself anymore. Any advice would be appreciated. 
I'm sorry this post turned out to be long.

TL;DR : my insecurities are acting up at all an all time high and wrecking my relationship. Boyfriend does not feel comfortable about telling me about things anymore due to the way my insecurities act up. And how I cause a fight everytime he hangs with his friends rather than spending time with me.",14Sep2019,1

121,"I'm a 25 yr old lady with some serious suicidal tendencies. I truly don't think I'll ever go through with it, but I also think about killing myself almost every day. I can't talk to my therapist about it without getting committed, and talking to my loved ones about it just ends up with them having a crisis about it that has little to do with me. I just wish I could work through it with someone without the guilt and shame over having the thoughts in the first place.",14Sep2019,1

I just can't get anywhere with women and when I do, they're just really overweight (not trying to judge). I'd much rather have something meaningful but that isn't in the cards right now, so my friend recommended a site he has used numerous times. I'm mostly worried about my legal safety lol and how to have a good first experience with it. Any suggestions?",14Sep2019,2

129,"I can't take it anymore every damn day its just people being stupid or taking things to the extreme. Yesterday a singer said his pronouns were ""They/Them"" I'm just sitting there screaming why the fuck does it matter and I swear to fuck some LGBT people take things way out of hand like I don't care if you're gay or bi just shut up about it for 5 minutes. I nearly lost my shit when the media started blaming video games for school shootings because video games are pretty much stopping me from being a school shooter. I remember growing up without hearing anything about LGBT stuff, feminism, white supremacists, or fucking people telling that I called them by the wrong damn pronoun all I really cared about were Saturday morning cartoons but I can't enjoy that now because the news is more important I swear to God if this shit continues I'm going to either kill someone or kill myself",14Sep2019,0
131,"I don't want a job

I don't really want anything

I like not having to do stuff and that's it

I work occasionally to avoid all the hardship of not having money

But I work no more than that, and with every time I work, I grow farther from knowing what I want, as I learn to detach myself from my experience in order to do what must be done

Every moment of free time brings with it the recognition that my free time, my work, and my future, are all empty, and there is no viable change to make

-------

I don't want to know my neighbors

I don't want to meet new people

I know they will judge differently, and poorly,

and I know that I don't want to explain my appearance, choices, and opinions

I fear possibilities and I judge myself very lacking in many core components of my life's choices

I'm not where I want to be and I no longer have the thought that it would be worth it to get there

I no longer have the desire to become a better person because it was always a means of garnering good reflections of myself from others

Now I don't care about their opinions, but still feel their gaze

I no longer try to be better, I only avoid being seen as bad, when it is not exceedingly difficult

but I always feel, whether projected or not, their negative judgement, regardless of how good I present myself

--------------

My mind withers more and more every year

I dont drink anymore, I don't smoke, and yet with disregard age decays my mind

I get sleepy after 12 hours, and do not sleep long, yet I'm not depressed. My lower back often hurts, my eyes take longer to adjust, my joints all get sore from walking or doing things with my hands, and every grimace stacks on to the cumulative damage to these joints that will make future ones worse, eventually rendering me de facto disabled

my days go by very fast unless I am tasked with work that day. 

on work days i focus on the future where i will not be working so much that i am very literally for all intents and purposes not there, and when the time comes after work i am tired and without fun things to do or people to spend time with, and it repeats every day, simply testament to perseverance and nothing more

on weekends my days go by fast, waking up and walking a few steps to the computer, and walkign around the apartment, and getting sleepy 12 hours later, and feeling in ways i dont think people will understand that i had just woken up when i am too sleepy and go to sleep again.

There's no carbon monoxide poisoning I believe and I'm not depressed, and this is an enumeration of negatives because they are worth focusing on until perchance I solve them.

132,"This just happened like an hour ago and I am fucking freaking out, didn't know who else to tell cause it's so embarrassing so I thought I'd post here.  Bit of back story I was visiting my grandma at the hospital and decided to park on top of the parking garage so I could wave goodbye to her when leaving. (she has dementia and always worries about us when we leave so it gives her some peace of mind to see us leaving outside)

&amp;#x200B;

So I wave at her window and I can see her waving back at me.  I was happy and wasn't thinking much and just backed out  quickly without looking cause there were no other cars on the roof where I was, just a wide open parking lot or so I thought.  Turns out there was a large light pole a few feet behind and to the left of my car and I completely smashed the corner of it wrecking the entire back of my sedan.  Like 2 inch dent all the way down across the trunk, bumper and frame.   The trunk can't close, the bumper is popped off on the left and the frame is severely bent.  Thankfully the car still drives.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know what to do right now, I'm completely losing it.  I'm a pretty poor student although I have some savings invested I was hopefully going to grow to use in a few years for a down-payment or something and in 5 seconds all of that has changed.  I don't know car damage that well but I've seen enough people around me get into accidents to know that this is probably a $2500 repair at least, a significant portion of my savings.  My insurance is also already insane for some reason so no going through them.  And next to the cost is the embarrassment, at least an actual car accident has some degree of stress/multiple actions involved.  This was just me not looking and throwing thousands of dollars away.

Everything was finally starting to look good for me in terms of finances, jobs and school and then this shit happens, and no one to blame but myself.

TL:DR: backed into a concrete pole, back of my car is completely wrecked, likely 2000+ in damages, commuting student feeling like pure garbage.

It definitely could have been worse and thankfully no one else was involved but damn do I feel like a piece of shit.",14Sep2019,1
