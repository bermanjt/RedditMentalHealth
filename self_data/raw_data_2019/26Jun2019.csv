1,"Yes this may grab some attention, but let me give my explanation. So in high school I listened to a lot of rap music because it was the cool thing to do and still is. (Graduated in 2018 so still fresh). So after graduating I still listened to rap music. Then everything was changed one afternoon, after work. My girlfriend had gotten tickets to go see the band Slayer at a local venue. She was going to have her mom go with her but she had an health issue. So I agreed to go now up to this point the heaviest music I had experienced was Korn or Trapt. Which I grew up on Southern Rock. So at this concert we missed Testament, and Bohemoth. Let that not fool you tho, the next three bands were Anthrax, Lamb of God, and the headliner Slayer.  It was an amazing experience to say the least, saw my first mosh pit with my own eyes which was wild. After the concert we went home and I found my love for the band Anthrax. Then I slowly moved around finding new bands and going heavier and heavier, but how it changed me as a person. I view society totally different then when I was listening to rap. Now in defense I was an kid in high school and I've done a lot of growing because of life situations. With life my philosophy has a new out look, and a more rational approach to it if that makes any sense. I may have rambled too much but if you would like to discuss more I have a couple of social media's and maybe a friendship could spawn who knows but Thanks for reading.",26Jun2019,1
2,"i’m kind of terrified.

i don’t want to be stuffed in a cramped room full of people that i never want to see ever again. i don’t think i can handle even hearing the names of certain people that i’ve had a hard time with this year.

i just want it all to end. this is the final hurdle.",26Jun2019,1

He told them today that he’s hooked on only pills, not the whole truth. He lives 1200 miles away. The only drugs I’ve seen firsthand are weed, alcohol, and tobacco.",26Jun2019,3
4,"Honestly being diagnosed with ADHD. My girlfriend dumping me because my ADHD played a huge factor in it. We both didn't know I had ADHD... but still. I'm waiting to get my meds... just sucks that looking back at life how much my ADHD held me back. Even now, I could rarely sit down for more than 2 hours watching a show. I always had to switch up and do something else. My ex girlfriend always thought it was because I got bored of her or doing something with her. It was hard to comprehend and listen at school. Even though I tried REALLY hard I couldn't pay attention to what my girlfriends had to say a lot of the times. Which made me look like an asshole.

An hour ago i was working out, decided to come in the house for some watermelon, grabbed some water and then found myself on my bed starting to watch a 40 minute video of understanding charts and graphs in the stock market. Couldn't get passed 2 minutes without having to rewind it 3-4 times to comprehend what he was saying... not even get passed 10 minutes without having to switch from IG to Reddit to YouTube. That's when I realized how fucking hard it is trying to go back to it. So instead I'm writing this shit down. Fuck man.",26Jun2019,4
5,"I did this post to based on a personal joke I made to myself last week. I was feeling a little down because my physical condition is not what it used to be. I found myself being a little envious of some guy jogging past my car. I was thinking to myself that I'm glad just be able to freakin' WALK... and I walk with ""Arthur."" (I'm sure you know who HE is. LMBO) I told myself that I've already had a terrible middle-age crisis now I'm having an old-age crisis. The very thought of having an old-age crisis amused me so much that I began to laugh at myself all by myself.

Now I'm sure you guys (or most of you) know about the curse of the middle-age crisis, and I don't mind admitting that mine sucked! We're talking constant regression, depression and a determination to try and relive the ""glory days."" I was a 40-something emotional wreck, and it almost wrecked my life! I finally reached that point in my life where I am happy to psychologically and emotionally walk through the door to the next chapter of my life with a smile. I never thought I would say something like this back in the day, but I'm glad I'm older and glad to BE older. It's just another level of fun and activity minus all the BS I went through when I was younger. Thanks for reading my post guys.

Peace",26Jun2019,1
6,"My friend has always come to me with girl problems and about 10 months ago he was left heartbroken with a breakup. I helped get him on his feet again, got him out of the house, helped him into the dating scene again.

Another thing I suggested he should do is work on himself by doing something new he has always wanted to try but never just went for it. With this in mind he began an acting course and became super passionate. He would call me about how his lessons went and new acting methods he had.

Well about a 3 months ago on his 3rd date since his big breakup he has now entered into a new relationship.

The girl is lovely for sure but I can't help feeling like my friend has now just limited himself all over again. He stopped going to the acting courses, he stopped going to the gym, and for the moment we're not meeting up as much.

I guess I felt like my friend had a great opportunity to finally lead the life he wanted and to develop himself after being in such an unhealthy/stifling relationship beforehand...But here he is a couple of months later and he's back in a intense relationship with a new girl and he seems to have forgotten about everything else...

There's something in my gut that tells me he's somehow wasting his life and his youth...",26Jun2019,1
7,"I'm (17F) allowed to go to my boyfriends (18M) whenever I want, but my dad refuses to let me spend the night anywhere with him.
I asked if it was a sex thing, he said no, it's just *""inappropriate"".*

This is his attempt at being a good parent after abusing both me and my older sister our entire lives, physically, mentally, &amp; emotionally.

He also wants me home by 8 every night.
I don't get why he needs to set boundaries for a young adult, or why I need to listen to him anymore (Teenage logic, I know). I was an anxious mess and I finally had the balls to make friends and get into a relationship and he's denying me the opportunity to just be a teenager and enjoy some real company without having a panic attack.

He also dumps me home alone a lot while he goes to spend the night with his gf.

9,"2018 was a really bad year. I lost my job, my marriage and my car was at the dealership for several times with the same problem. One of these times, the dealer gave me a rental car and I didnt think about insurance since I wasn't paying for the rental, the dealer was. Well the rental car was in a hit and run accident while I was at home and the car was parked in front of my house..now I'm receiving a collections notice to pay 4.8k for the damages and i dont even have a job.

10,"so a couple of weeks ago i met up with friends from high school {19m} we met up and were having a good time talking about life and listening to music, until we smoked weed. we all smoke somewhat frequently so we thought everything was going to be okay but this strain hit like king k rool, i went from a 4 to a 9 very quickly and i started having a bad trip, i live around 40 minutes away. one of my friends commented that i was scaring him because i was walking around and not saying anything while they were sitting down, i told them that i had to leave

after the link up we all laughed about how hard the strain hit and now neither of them will talk to me anymore, i admitted to one of my friends that had i known about how strong the strain was i would've taken less hits.

In many ways, life and love are synonymous. When we understand love, practice love and enjoy love, we also deepen our experience of life. Love is innate in all of us and is the very foundation of our being. It is the source of all our power and strength.

I just wish I could stop and had the ability to tell when somebody is just messing with me or being serious but I don’t so I take everything to heart. I just wish I could make friends and feel happy but I’ve been living with depression that has me suicidal and social anxiety for years now.

I most likely drive people away given the way I act and I just wish I could fix it and be happy. I don’t know, I just needed to get this off my chest. I don’t really like myself and people have trouble liking me as far as I believe. I can’t do anything right. I try to be as happy and confident as I can everyday but it just doesn’t work.

15,"Ever since i started working out and taking care of myself again and eating right I cant enjoy the old foods that I loved eating. I used to love going to Wendys and getting a Baconator meal with a large fry. I used to love being at home and ordering pizza and chilling on the couch watching a basketball game. Now that theres a taco bell near me the ""old me"" would have ate a ton of tacos and kept going back for more. Now all I do is count the time in between my cheat days so I can pig out on what I really like but never eating as much as I used to on said day.  

I loved the part of myself that ate and didnt count calories and watch my macros or cared about being in shape. I almost feel like a crackhead sometimes lol. I know food shouldnt have that big of a grip on me but theres just some foods that taste **that** good to me that I still have a hard time shaking. in order for me to live my life in its fullest extent I have to keep eating properly. 

Does anybody know what I mean? If I slip into my old habits ill regret it for sure, I just REALLY liked being able to eat my favorite foods when I wanted to and not feel bad for going over my caloric limits. All im sure of is that when im in my 50s im going to get huge",26Jun2019,1

18,"Hello, I'm sort of very confused and have no clue! Let me explain my background, I was born raised majority of my time from friends and books never from any of the blood relatives. Reasons, my relatives always came up with a-hole comments and opinions that just made you feel more worthless and uninspired. So growing up was a messy process for me. After years of mistakes and reading the write books. My thirteen year old niece who is adopt since she was a baby by my sister is suffering from depression. So my issue is even though she is unrelated to me I still want to be of help in her life because I didn't have that growing up and know how difficult it was to teach yourself. But My dad keeps on insisting I'm wasting my time on a her because he feels she a lost cause. What should I do?",26Jun2019,2
19,"I’ve been tight with Alice (not her real name) since I moved to my city over a decade ago.  We originally dated briefly, but it didn’t go anywhere, and a really good friendship came out of it.  We did everything together.  Going out to bars now and then, both of us were into hockey, mutual geeky interests, and so on.  She was the one who listened when I went through a devastating breakup, and she stayed at my apartment when she went through the same.  When I needed her, she would be there, and when she needed me, I would be there.  She was a bridesmaid in my wedding.  She came to my father’s funeral.  Alice has been there through everything.  We called each other “sister.”

Then she met a guy.  She has had issues with confidence, and the guy took full advantage of it.  I should have seen something wasn’t right when she made excuses as to why he wasn’t able to meet any of her friends (turns out he refused to meet us because he felt we were “bad influences on [her.]”)  Her communication was not as frequent but I had chalked it up to new relationship energy and how everyone gets completely wrapped up in a new person they start dating.  Then one day I realized that she had blocked me from all social media, and all phone calls I made to her following that realization were quickly declined.  She never responded to my texts.  When I asked around to her other friends, I found out that he insisted she cease speaking to her old friends, especially anyone she had a physical relationship with previously.  So she did.  She blocked everyone.  Alice has not spoken a single word to me or literally anyone she used to hang around, with the exception of one person who ran into her at her retail job and asked what the heck was going on.  She’s withdrawn noticeably from her parents, who she was close with, and her relationship with her little sister, who she was closer to than anyone else in her life, has devolved into “cordial.”  

It was terrifying to see what he has done to her.  We have all tried to get through to her, but she has blocked out everyone.  She’s an adult, so there is literally nothing anyone can do.  She has even admitted to her parents and sister that she knows his isolating tactics are abusive.  I hate him for the emotional and verbal abuse he has heaped onto her and the way he has made her a ghost of herself.  The thought that his abuse may spread to other forms makes me want to break down into hysterics.

But I’m also angry.  At Alice.  It feels like she chose this.  It feels like she threw everything away for a man who she knows treats her like shit and makes unreasonable, abusive demands of her.  She cut me out of her life so quick and neatly that it felt like I didn’t matter at all.  Like how you just stop talking to that person you barely know but don’t like, and never really think of them again afterwards.  She dropped my spare house key off under my front mat without even telling me she had left it there, rather telling her sister to let me know.  It makes me so mad because it feels like all that we have been through together was meaningless.  That standing with me at the altar meant nothing.  That hugging me as I watched my father’s casket be lowered into his grave meant nothing.  All the late nights, long talks, laughter, and tears meant nothing.  That she could just drop it all like our friendship never meant anything to begin with is a painful betrayal.  It hurts.  It hurts so much.  I never want to see her again.  I don’t think we could ever be friends again, or at least nothing like how close we were.  I don’t **want** to be friends with her again.

Yet I know this isn’t her fault.  Her boyfriend is clearly emotionally, psychologically, and verbally abusive.  He latched onto her struggling self esteem and took full advantage.  She was a victim of that and her withdrawal from her friends was not a spiteful, deliberate move on her part.  It has never been in her nature to hurt anyone for any reason.  I know this.  Logically, I know this.  I know that when she breaks free (please let her break free), she will need support and love.  She will need friends to catch her.  I want to be that person for her, along side others.  I want my best friend back.  I want to see her freed from this living garbage-heap’s abuse.  But I’m bitter, angry, feeling betrayed, and if I got a phone call from someone saying Alice is out of that relationship, I don’t know if I could do anything other than say “whatever” and hang up.

I hate feeling like this.",26Jun2019,4

All my friends seem occupied and I don’t want to bother them, but i’ve began to notice every day I spend by myself is gloomy, it’s not enjoyable even with the accompany of online strangers. So I concluded playing games by myself is not something I can enjoy doing. But I soon came to realise, I really lack self-love.

25,"For my whole career, I've always brought home-made lunch with me to work, eating it in the break room. At times, my coworkers ask if I'd like to join them for lunch at the employee restaurant downstairs, and I always politely decline and say that I brought lunch with me.

Sometimes, I'd really like to join them, but I have no idea how I'm supposed to act there. I've seen there are like six lanes of different stuff, the cashier lady is somewhere in the middle of the lane jungle, and then there are the drinks and breads and whatnot scattered every which way. I've eaten in such places for like three times in my life, and I always just followed the guy before me, taking the same food he did, but I always ended up with food I didn't particularly like, only to see that other people had gotten something else from the different lanes. Or, back in college, they had really strict limitations on what you were allowed to eat and drink for the base price, and a single extra glass of juice would cost extra.

When I go to the employee restaurant... Where do I start there? Am I allowed to take multiple dishes? How many glasses of juice am I allowed to take? What costs extra? Am I supposed to pay upfront and then collect my food, or should I collect everything first and pay afterwards? The restaurant's web site doesn't help me at all, there seems to be no guidelines at the restaurant and all the people are just bouncing every which way. Why can't it be just a single line of dishes, drinks and bread, and then you pay and eat? Why does it have to be so many lanes and zig-zagging between them, only to feel completely lost in the middle of all this and wondering if the cashier lady thinks I'm stealing food or something?",26Jun2019,5

29,"This is first post on reddit so please bear with me if I’m doing something wrong here. I’m still quite new and trying to figure this app out.

I am currently a 17 year old girl and he is 19. For as long as I can remember, we have never gotten along. Everything he does manages to get under my skin, and vice versa. While I have always wished we had a better sibling relationship, we have never shown each other any sort of affection or even an interest in bettering our shitty relationship.

He attends a university in which the drive to get there is about 12 hours. He is on his college’s men’s gymnastics team, and because of his consistent practice schedules, he rarely gets to visit home. The times he does get to visit home, such as for winter or summer break, he only gets to stay for a maximum of about two weeks before he has to take a flight back to where his college is located. His short visits have never bothered me as we never talk to each other to begin with, with the exception of being at a family event or outing. The reason I’m writing about this now is because of something that happened last winter break that makes me think that him and I have the potential to have a better sibling relationship (yes, I am aware that it is the end of June and that this happened like 6 months ago, but I still think about it almost every day).

It was his last day being at home. He was about to leave for the airport with my parents, they were waiting for him in the car. It’s typical for my brother to always be running late. I had come downstairs to watch him leave, and despite what I had said previously, I still wanted to say goodbye to him. It felt wrong not to. He was gathering up his last few things, such as his backpack and a sandwich for the car ride to the airport. As he was about to walk out the door, he turned around to give our dog one last pet goodbye. As he did this, I saw him rub his face. “What a wuss,” I think to myself, “this dude is crying”. Therefore, I audibly laugh and say out loud, “are you crying?”, except I didn’t actually think he was crying, I just thought he itched his face or something and I wanted to poke fun at him for it. He looks up at me and turns out he actually was crying. I can’t remember the last time I saw him cry. That’s when it hit me, seeing him so sad about leaving made me realize how hard it actually must be for him to be away from home so much. How much he must miss being with our family when he’s away. I didn’t know what to say seeing him cry, so I just went in for a hug. If I’m being honest, that is the first time that I can recall that we had ever voluntarily hugged each other. Quickly after the hug, he had to leave.

As soon as he left, I just began to cry. I had never thought that I would ever be saddened by my brother leaving. I instantly regretted not spending more time with him while he was still at home with us. I’m not even sure when I’ll get to see him next.

I know it’s not much of a story. But to me, it’s something. I can’t say I have a good relationship with my brother, but at least I can say that we shared that moment. I’m not sure if he even thinks of it as meaningfully as I do. I just want to make it a goal of mine for next time he visits to interact with him more, maybe play some video games together or something like that, just anything we could bond over.",26Jun2019,14

31,"I think about this a lot and I'd love to chat about it, but moreso I think I just want to write it out. I just watched the movie Avatar again, and I've been thinking about the line where Jake (or Grace?) says that there is far more wealth around us than in the ground (money).

&amp;#x200B;

I think we (=humans in 'developed' societies) have destroyed the only world that could bring us fulfillment. I think we have made life too easy in a lot of ways and too difficult in many others. We worry about things 24/7 that should not even exist. I think love, nature, and survival are the pillars of our well-being and we have completely diminished our ability to satisfy almost all of those. So much of nature is absolutely decimated, we will never see it in its full glory as it used to sustain us when we were foragers. We don't need to put much effort into simple survival anymore, so we will rarely ever get to feel the satisfaction of fighting for it. And love is just... Complex, now. I do not doubt it was complex before, this is one I think is the most raw thing we can pursue in modern day.

&amp;#x200B;

I just think money is a vicious cycle. I think our society, corporations have systematically taken from us what truly makes life fulfilling so that they can sell us diluted versions for the entire duration of our lives. Think about beauty, for example. Grey hair, pimples, wrinkles, fat, uneven skin tones, so many more... Are these things inherently ugly? Is there something about them that makes us any less worthy than if we did not have them? Of course not, except according to the climate we live in. Companies pay to advertise to us, to instill in us a sense of self-hatred so that they can sell us products that are branded as vehicles to self-acceptance. Hate your wrinkles? We thought so, buy this filler treatment so you can be beautiful again. So that you can accept yourself again, overcome the shame that we created in you. The shame that runs so deep that it is passed down from mothers to daughters, students to peers, between lovers.

&amp;#x200B;

We are whole even without a single cent to our name, shirt on our back, without anything. We are beings in a network of millions of other beings, plants, etc. We once fit into a natural balance, adapted for that spot. But we destroyed that balance, that network. It exists no longer. We have replaced it with a world in which we each have little purpose but to compete with each other for some sense of fulfillment. A world not suited for creatures who adapted to exist in an entirely different one, surrounded by nature and companionship. Many of us are without a tribe, a group who we would not have been able to survive without before modern day. Now we can survive alone, but are we meant to be?

&amp;#x200B;

It is hard to feel okay in this world, not to go crazy with so much extra time to ponder and stress over this deep, un-fillable void. This is the explanation I have thought of.",26Jun2019,167

33," Im a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way but she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly but I took it as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She had sent me the other side of a city with a letter one day and I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else and told her if an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself.

So lately I find myself up late into the night, struggling to sleep. Eyes wide awake, with my mind wondering over every little detail of my life. School, work, family, friends, relationship, myself. Especially myself. I question the reality of things and if I’m really sane or just becoming this empty husk of myself. It’s a strange emotion, a strange feeling and sometimes I shrug it off, other times I just laugh it off, sometimes, I lose to it and feel this strange tingling sensation on the back of my neck, and it begins to pulse over and over again as I put my hand to my face to try and gain control over myself.

I stand strong over the ideal that people can change, people are good, but then I take a look at myself, my mistakes in life, my own personal struggles and I question how good is the world when I’m feeling like I’m slowly cracking under the weight of it all. Does everyone think like I do? Maybe everyone thinks the world is good till they struggle to look at themselves and realize they’re a horrible person and then they question how horrible everyone else is.

Yet that's not how I should think. I don’t think people are awful, I don’t think I’m awful, I don’t think my friends, and family that I personally picked and chosen are awful people, that's why I picked them.

What can I do to help myself stabilize myself? I question that every day, I sacrifice myself sometimes a bit too much other times I keep everything away from myself to bring a sort of balance and I think balance is the best way to live through everything.

A random question I have is, if I say sorry all the time does that devalue the apology? Or since I apologize for my mistakes which constantly are changing the reason I say sorry because I’m fine tuning the details I get wrong in life and sometimes I fine tune just a bit too much that the results come out negative in the opposite end of the spectrum. Does that give my apologizes more value because I’m always adjusting but no formula ever comes out perfect the first try.

I guess that’s all for now because I can’t help but feel anymore details would just be me rambling over nothing that makes sense.

39,"ok i dont know how to do casual conversation. i feel just saying that i have walked 7 KM is not enough?  
so i wanted to share what i plan to do.  
i started exercising since 4 or 3 days ago. i am planning to mix my exercises. here is my plan  


2 or 3 times a week i will go running.  
2 or 3 rimes a week i will ride my bike.  
rest of days i will go walking. in case i dont want to do both running or cycling then i will go walking. the idea is to never stop doing any kind of exercise. what is important is that i keep moving.  
my main goal is to push my limits. every time i get better, i will increase the mileage or difficulty. losing weight or getting fit is not my main goal. it is my secondary goal.   


i plan to run 60 mins after 4 months. what after that? i run longer or do something harder. i feel if i limit my goal or make it specific i would stop at some point. i dont want that. i do exercises mainly because it changes my mood and makes my sleeping better. it changes my personality and thinking a bit. i feel like i am different person. it is amazing and almost a miracle. please tell me if this is not casual so i can better myself at posting here.",26Jun2019,7
41,"I feel like everyone talks about growth and how after hardship and stuff they thrive and prosper. Why does it feel like that will never happen to me? 

I see my friends and other people I know who recover and have so much happier and better lives after hardship. They talk about how they’re growing and thriving. I’ve had one of the worst years after I got my heart broken by an abusive boyfriend who was also the love of my life, or so it seemed. I haven’t had luck with love since then (October), I’ve always had an abusive single mother who loves my brother more than me and has never been a mother to me, and all of my friends are away and living much better lives than me it feels like I can’t open up to them anymore. I thought maybe now was a period of growth, when I’d return back stronger than ever but I feel like I’m continuing to be torn down. I’m trying to work on myself physically at least since it’s more controllable, but my grandma forced me to cut my hair short and I’ve feel like I’ve gotten uglier. I starve myself and control my eating and work my ass off in the gym and I can’t lose weight meanwhile I have friends who are stick skinny and don’t work out and have perfect bodies and I cry because I can’t have one - I can’t have a family who loves me I can’t be pretty I can’t be talented in something bc my mom refuses to let me take classes or help support something and right now I don’t know when i start my first job which is in the middle of nowhere away from all my friends. This is mainly a rant bc I can’t turn to anyone anymore but i genuinely think my life will never ever get better and I don’t think I’ll ever have a period of happiness. I don’t think I’ll grow and have the perfect body that I love and I won’t get a job that I like and won’t ever get the life I want to have and all I will do is sit trapped forever",26Jun2019,1

The truth of the matter is I’m not happy anyway.
So why the hell would I settle?

It’s insane to me that people make money making music..
You’ve gone rappers now who are like the rockstars of years gone by, trashing hotel rooms , swarmed by hot girls, stupid amount of drugs and alcohol, stage dives and sports cars.

I won’t be happy just playing golf on the weekends and driving my economical Honda around town.
I don’t even give a shit about the material things but it’s the fact that I’d have to make choices based on my living situation and more importantly my career.. 

I’m not worried about living long, at this rate it’s more likely be at my hands but I’ll just do whatever the hell I want and be happy for as long as it keeps going.

52,"I live in Australia and I am 16 in year 11. I go to a normal public school but I hate it so much now, I need to get out due to the fact that there are no subjects that will help me reach my career I want to pursue and I just get really shitty feelings when I go to school.

I brought up changing schools to my mum so many times during the last month and a half but she just kept disregarding my reasoning and thought it was because two out of seven of my close friends were changing.

 The school I wanted to change to is a senior college, so they offer classes for SACE 1 and SACE 2 (year 11 and year 12), they also have many adults attending the school. 

My mum finally booked a meeting and we went in today to speak to a subject counsellor. The lady was really nice and understood why I wanted to change.

When we finished talking about career paths, uni and other courses the lady showed me around the school, this is what made me confident in my decision to change. The lady took me outside and asked me ""from what you can hear how many people do you think are here right now?"" I heard nothing, complete silence, I answered with barely anyone and she told me that there are around 800 people at the school and I was amazed. She showed me around the school and it just looked so nice and amazing, the interactions made me feel welcome even though I was nervous. 

This school is so much better compared to my school now which is just full of, drug addicts, annoying people and the  'I think I'm so popular and cool' type of people.

The thing that makes me so angry and upset is that my mum left it to the last minute to book a meeting. There is only two weeks left of the term, two weeks holidays and then school goes back. This means that all the students at the school have already chosen their subjects and the two subjects I wanted to do are full and two others were only held in the first semester. 

I'm not sure about my chances of getting in but I made a new list of subjects that I would still like and my mum is hopefully going to ring them up and find out.

I get so annoyed, angry and upset about this because she left it to the last minute and now this has happened. I feel like everything good I tried to do for myself went to shit and I am a sitting duck, not being able to do anything right now. 

Fortunately one of the two friends going to this new school is really amazing and I was able to let out all these shitty feelings which I have normally never been able to do with my other 'friends'.

Thank you for reading this post even though it is just me rambling on, I have never really done this before.

tl;dr: Current school = bad, school I want to go to = good. Mum left it to late and now I may not be able to go for the rest of year 11.",26Jun2019,1

57,"Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, or if I’ve missed the point of this sub, please re-direct me if so. 

I’m in my early twenties, and for a long time, I feel like I’ve been living my life on auto pilot. I’ve been doing all the things I felt made sense to do, and thing that I would be stupid not to, but I never felt like I really made those decisions because I wanted to. 

It’s not that I regret anything I’ve done, I’ve got a great life, and from an outside perspective, I could look like someone who has it all figured out. I’ve done quite well for myself in life, albeit not without help from the people around me, I’d never say I was self-made in any way. I don’t want to share too many details, but I’m in a committed relationship, I have started a good career, and I think I’m doing ok at it, and I have a good place to live. 

The problem isn’t that I’m unhappy or remorseful about where I am in life, it’s just that I I don’t feel anything at all. I feel kind of “numb” all the time. I’ve felt for a long time that I’ve been just going along with life, doing what I have to do, waiting for the time when I can do what I want to do and be happy, but I don’t know what that is. 

I feel happy for a short while when I’m spending time to people close to me, I achieve a goal or do something creative, or when I drink to the right level of tipsiness, but it’s always fleeting, and almost feels like I’m putting on an act of happiness but not really feeling anything. 

Am I depressed? Is it normal to feel like this? Is it a thing to do with growing up, or maybe a generational thing? I honestly don’t know. I’m just worried that one day I’ll realise my entire life was lived like this, and that I never really got to “live”.

58,"Hello all!

I have never written a poem before. But I was inspired and the words just kind of came to me. I just wanted to share and get thoughts on it. Please let me know what you think!

Untitled

My soul, weary and desperately begging for release, put out an emergency call for aid. A half-hearted cry of despair; the dying screams of someone baking in unforgiving desert heat. Searching for a salve, some medicine to heal the ache, but with little expectation of response. I held my breath.

You heard my cries and acted without reservation, bathing me in cool waters as if your resources are as limitless as the ocean itself. You awakened a hunger and desire that had been half-dead and dormant for years, sealed away in a cage and dehydrated from the drought. I was diminished from neglect, withered and dry, and your love poured over me like a restorative rain shower, soaking me to the bone.

We held each other, close and clinging, as our souls sailed past formalities and entwined like two lovers bathing under the moonlight.
We languished in the sincerity of the encounter, and came together, starving and ravenous for each other's affections.

Promises made prior to our passion loomed like the blazing sun, unforgiving and scorching. We shielded each others eyes from the dawn and slipped back into the waters to escape together, floating forever in a dream that I pray will never end.",26Jun2019,1

Let’s work together and get through this just like we said we would etc etc.,” I allowed myself to be vulnerable and put our relationship first. He replied “Please let me rest”.

62,"I recently just finish my college entrance exam and for the longest time i could remember, i was scared shitless about this test. I lost. I thought once i got over i would be all happy and riddled with dopamine and all that. Little to my surprise, i came home feeling barely overjoyed, maybe momentarily, i put up some music then jammed to it, no big deal. But i felt like the void inside of me is not filled and not just filled with random garbage but something worthwhile. 

&amp;#x200B;

I began thinking, what would happen if i do make it to college? What's new? I might probably just gonna study harder or just as hard as high school to maybe achieve some ""high quality"" label like oh i got an A+ qualification on me. Some people would say oh when you get to college you are gonna have fun and barely study, mostly play but teachers told me before entering high school during the high school entrance exam that we were gonna play in high school but that was complete BS. And what if i do pass college? Will i even land an entry level job since the workplace is already overflodded with people and employers demand experience for entry level positions? Maybe afterwards, am i gonna be able to move forward or just gonna stuck in a non progressive career? My brain keeps popping up the thought that is i might be just another redundant uninteresting person who just studies and maybe finds a dead end job and doesnt do anything outside of his comfort zone and i feel, in a way, sad just imagining maybe thats just me i cant progress fast i barely live up to all these things in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of the head, i recently tried meditating while i do know that you arent gonna be master at day one at anything i still see myself wandering and just picking thought battles (which led to the writing of this post) that put certain-not-even-happening images into my head. I still think im carrying a heavy piece of rock on top of my body, the brain seems like it is waiting to be pop out of my skull. I thought alot. I thought so much, i didn't do what i thought about how much i want and how am i gonna do it. I thought so much i feel like it has taken over me. During the test i was taking, we have to check the student number and the test number on the exam sheet, i wrote mine and through out the testing period, i found myself overchecking those 2 numbers, over and over again cause i was afraid im gonna write the wrong one and fuck up my entire grade. Looking back, i felt like i checked the numbers too much i didnt know what was the limit number of my checking them. Yesterday when i was trying to sleep, i kept thinking about the numbers of the previous test (the exam was 2-3 day long), about how i might have written the wrong number and all when i did remember i was also doing the overthinking-number-checking during that test. There's gotta be a fine line between being careful and overthink, man but its just i overthink but sometimes i'm still not careful.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the comfort zone detail, as a kid, i was under the impression that things can happen quickly or almost in an instant and unfortunately i apply that to being sociable, which now i think it's just hideous but what label's gonna do. I used to think that i can just shut my mouth and barely talk to people and just be instantly sociable when needed. Now that i try to say the things that i want, as i was doing it, i'm riddled with self doubt and a mind that is bringing up justifications for not saying the things i want. Just as today, i want to step out of the school gate and talk to some girls and possibly say some 'clever"" lines i came up with but all those things in the previous sentence happened and i didnt do it. I never realized it would be this hard and that i would pussy out. When i ""imagine"" my ideal self, my ideal self would just come up to women or people and just say the thing i want but no, they are all imaginative thoughts and they probably dont matter. (And i thought that back when i was self loathing a lot {but i eventually stop} when i reach XYZ state {in this case being 18 and complete high school} that im gonna instantly be my ideal self and be super handsome and confident going up to people and talk just the most jaw dropping out of the norm brilliant thing but again BS). I had this ideal image of myself since i was about 5 i think, i would live inside my head thinking about how am i gonna be my ideal self and do this in this situation that is right in front of my face while im sitting and watching it. And unfortunately i gotta live with this obsolete, outdated way of thinking, it feels miserable to describe it, the old ways of doing things now stuck with you and you are gonna pay for it. I also thought i was gonna be instantly getting rid of faulty programming of my own mind but then again what else can i say?

&amp;#x200B;

I look at some people on Youtube videos, seeing how they go out on the street and do the most absurd shit, say the most absurd thing and just doing it like an absolute pro, almost without any fear or hesistation. I know this seems like a grass is greener on the other side and im not seeing everything but what i have gather from watching them a lot is that overall they are really socially confident and i just love it. The thing is that social confidence seems downright daunting, you have to face this ""oh people think im this, oh people gonna tell other people this,etc..."" and millions of other fear justifications. Since im finished high school and got probably a month break now i might try to go out and talk to some girls, see if i can get over this barrier. I feel mentally drained as of writing this tbh. I dont know if i can achieve the social confidence from the people i ""look up to"" (i dont necessarily admire them deeply but they have an aspect i dearly want for myself). I would think about how am i gonna do things but ended up not doing it and not to mention mastery takes a long ass time and if i spend most of my time not doing then i will be even more accustomed to not doing since i think part of the reason why i think that is because its quite true that when i was a kid i could ""change my mindset"" more often but i foolishly chose the one that is gonna cripple my current/future self (which was not acting, fearing people, pleasing them, self loathing). Seeing people (not just the ones on the net that i mentioned but from outside) being really confident and i realized how much time i wasted not being confident and got used to it. I thought about going out to talk to girls before the test for quite some time but a common pattern i saw was that i usually delay things that i want then when i do reach the time to do it i barely do it and walk out on it. Obstables are bigger when you are facing them.

&amp;#x200B;

Socially, in high school i feel like im socially unfufilled, the relationships i have is just bunch of redundant small talks not to mention i always am the one who is doing the ""chasing"". When i get comfortable with people, i tend to talk alot to them, i stand near them, pat them on the shoulder but i feel like im the one who's doing too much. I dont want to blame people cause when i do try to get people attention, my voice is not loud enough ( part of my crippling confidence i most likely assume) but i think im usually the one who goes up to people and talk to them like some servant just to have them barely give me any answer and reply using some recycled social script. I also admit i dont lead conversations that well lots of time, i talk about boring-nobody-cares topic or just plain uninteresting but there are times that i ask personal stuff and i share my own it was not satisfactory. I want to build connections, i dont want to force people to talk but how am i supposed to do it when i barely have people who dont care.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, picture a prisoner with a heavy metal ball and a chain which attaches to his leg, the metal ball represents my bad habits and past thought patterns which still lives till now, that's how i think i am right now, i am ""haunted by my past"", i mistreated myself now im paying for it.

I've hence set the pattern of isolating from others. People in my class tend to sit away from me. I later regret doing that and I tried to bridge the pattern but I don't seem to have any chemistry with them and can't move past small talk.

I will soon begin a new internship and I really want to bridge this gap and make new friends. How can I do that? When I approach others, I tend to feel very awkward and stressed as I already feel like they labelled me as weird.

73,"Me and my best friend, both women, have been friends forever, and we're super close. I have nothing but love and positivity for her. But I've struggled with accepting that I'm naturally ugly my whole life, and she's probably one of the prettiest women I've ever met.

I don't really feel jealous of her, I just feel insecure about myself whenever we're together. I always have to wear makeup when we meet up, and she doesn't wear any at all, and she still looks way better than me. I feel like whenever people see us they wonder why she's hanging out with me. 

I really want to get over this because it makes me nervous whenever I see her, which makes hanging out together less fun, even though she's amazing. I just don't know how to get over this.",26Jun2019,2

77,"Ok, i'm a geek. I always hated gym class. I'm no athlete. I mean, Elementary Gym class was fine, we did a lot of more fun stuff. Like, a sit n' bounce (whatever that was called). It was games, we even got a DDR Machine in there once.

But middle school was a different story. They had a ridiculously strict dress code. You had to wear shirts and a t-shirt, with the school's logo. You couldn't wear what you already had on. 

Meaning, you had to change in front of everybody. Now, i've always been tubby. And i don't like changing in front of people. My family had always been body shaming me. Then, we also had to start doing real sports. No more rock walls, no more ddr. We had to play football and basketball. And, My God, that torture device callled...The Pacer Test. I had absolutely dreaded doing gym.

So, 6th grade, i got lucky. It just wasn't on my schedule. 7th grade, not so much. I had it on my schedule for the 3rd quarter. But, i got lucky, early in the year i had a broken ankle. Which, excused me from gym. I was so excited.  I got put into a much more fun and appealing Drama class. 

But 8th grade, i had gym again. However, luck was in my court again. I had a bad habit of not doing homework. I was a crappy student, so they took me out of all my ""Elective"" classes before the 4th quarter (when i was supposed to have gym). Instead of having those classes, i had a study hall. No changing in front of people!

My bad luck saved me, i guess.

79,"So when I was either 6 or 7 the classroom that I was in had a small bookcase, and each section was labelled with fiction or non-fiction (as are most bookcases in schools). I remember being bored and looking through the non-fiction and finding a book about how babies grow. This book wasn’t about how the baby grows, but instead the different stages of growth that a fetus goes through in the womb. I guess I found it relatively interesting as I did read it. At that time I wasn’t exactly amazing at reading, so I was mainly looking at the pictures (which I suppose led to some misunderstanding of information in the end). What I could guess through the pictures, was that babies (fetus’) start off as tiny little eggs in the woman. And that if a white fish touches it, the egg will grow into a weird looking baby.

So I did what any 6/7 year old child would do with this new found information and the knowledge that I have accumulated over my lifetime. Which was to come to the conclusion that since all baby’s start off as an egg babies are actually birds, because that’s what birds come from.

I don’t actually remember anything else after that or what I did with that ‘knowledge’. Until, I said it to my mum during a conversation. Apparently I told her about this information I had found, and both her and my dad kinda just acknowledged it but also ignored it. There wasn’t anything wrong with knowing a fetus starts of as an egg, although she did say that she made sure that I didn’t think babies where birds.

TL:DR when I was 6 or 7 for a short half day I thought babies where birds because of a book I read/looked at.",26Jun2019,5

81,"I’m not gonna act like I make six figures and have some crazy life, but things are going exceptionally well and I’m stunned thinking about it out loud. 

1) about a year ago I told my company I was leaving. Was tired of my boss’ bs and saw future problems coming up that were out of my control. They offered me a significant raise and very high bonus to stay and listened to my concerns &amp; made adjustments. 

2) I recently turned down the promotion I asked my boss for because I didn’t want to move to the middle of nowhere and start over.  So I decided to take on more temporary work but stay in my current role, with higher level responsibilities. After that they offered me a temporary bonus for covering more work and added me to a long term earnout plan based on the company’s ownership and performance. 

Idk it’s just weird and I know I am likely being overpaid. Usually in the workplace I focus on the negatives and think of reasons I need to leave but recently they’ve been trying to help me out and it motivates me to work harder and appreciate the little things about my job. I’m actually excited for the company and I now feel tied to it’s overall success. Never really thought I’d have this feeling about a company. Hopefully more good things are to come. 

I really struggle with self value and confidence and this has helped tremendously. And on top of that I’m really not sure but my outlook on life has changed a lot since I left a sour relationship. Nothing bad, just wasn’t happy and it weighed on me. I now do what makes me happy and live to try to make every day positive. Guess you gotta have some highs with the lows!

83,"I don't feel like I can tell this full story to anyone I know, so enjoy stranger:

I have been so overwhelmed. I quit a job that was incredibly toxic for me, where the owners were running a scam on the employees and patrons. I was getting paid just above minimum wage and thought that despite struggling to find a job before this one, it would be different. I thought I knew how to leverage my degree and had gotten some great advice. It's been over two months now and I haven't gotten any interviews and my drive to submit applications have dwindled over time. I've maybe submitted 2 or 3 in the last few weeks and savings is dwindling. I have less than $1000 in the bank.

My girlfriend has also been having a hard time personally. We live with my mom, gf and I in separate rooms because of family rules. My gf is depressed, and has always disliked parental authority because of a messy family history. Living with my mom has kept her from feeling free and she finally decided it had been enough. She's moving 300+ miles away, back where she lived when we were long distance. We're not breaking up, but it's felt like we are. She's been incredibly distant for over 6 months and even before then it was difficult to get her to give affection after a couple of months living together and asking her to go to therapy was a ""no."" It's made me feel lonely and unlovable.

My friends are also incredibly far away or no longer have the time or desire to hang out with me. Best friends moved to other states. Other (semi-local) best friend is getting married and is just outright busy. Other friends never hit me up and reaching out to anyone but best friends has been incredibly difficult. It's isolating to feel that way.

All of this is on top of my mom being confined to a wheelchair for 8 months now because she has fractures in her feet and arthritis. My dog is also not doing so great. Arthritis, almost 15, and sometimes a lack of appetite make me all worry about her.

And then just me, in my own head. I'm depressed. I'm anxious. My self worth is almost non-existent. I've been seeing a therapist and struggling to get in to see any psychiatrist. Ones with availability just don't exist it seems and I know I need antidepressants.",26Jun2019,1
84,"Last week my very good friend and I were hanging out in the park just sitting on a bench and talking. My friend then said something funny that made me laugh out loud. 

Round about that time a drunk guy with a bottle in his hand was walking past us looked at me and told me to stop laughing like an idiot and proceeded to call me a stupid and loud n-word. It was totally uncalled for and came out of nowhere. For the record this was a very public park with kids running around and screaming everywhere. Plus, I wasn’t even laughing that loudly. 

Anyway my friend suddenly stood up and lunged at him and proceeded to tackle him to the ground. The guy tried to hit my friend with the bottle but my friend grabbed it just in the nick of time and punched him in the face. He then made the guy apologize to me before I pleaded with him to just let him go. 

In the 8 years I’ve known my friend, this was the angriest I’ve ever seen him. He’s genuinely one of the nicest people I know and I would never associate him with any violent outbursts. I have been called the n word many times in my life but this was the first time it happened in his presence. Before this point we had honestly never had a serious conversation about race despite the fact that I’m black and he’s white. This incident enabled us to talk more openly about it and I believe it has also added a layer of depth to our friendship. I’d say we’ve definitely become a lot closer than we were as a result.",26Jun2019,3076
85,"Lately, I haven't been able to get myself to do things. I know that there are things I need to get done, but the I just don't do them. I try to force myself to do it, but I can't get the motivation. I thought maybe I'm depressed, but I don't know. Sometimes I am able to get myself to do things, but it takes a lot of willpower and focus in order for me to do so. Sometimes I feel sad, but it's because I can't figure out how to be productive. I just kind of feel like I can't be helped, and that I am just stuck this way, and that this is just the way I am or something. I really want to get out of this laziness that I have, but I can't for some reason. And the thing is, I feel like I have the ability to do the things I need to do, but I choose not to do it because it feels like so much and like such a big deal. Even though I know deep down that it really isn't. It just feels exausting even though it isn't. I just don't feel like doing it for some reason. 

For example, I was trying to get out of bed this morning, but i just couldnt get myself to do it. I knew i needed to do it, but I just felt more comfortable staying in bed instead of getting up. I just could not find the motivation to get up. And as a result i ended up sleeping till 11:00 when i was supposed to get up at 7:00. Then, after i got up i got a little bit of things done, but then i went back to bed and slept for another hour or two. And now the day is almost over and i havent got much done at all. This is happening almost everyday and im falling really behind in school (I do homeschool) and i dont know what to do.

Do you think this is depression or just laziness? And if it is just laziness, how do I stop this? Because I have been trying everything and I can't stop being lazy no matter what. Thanks",26Jun2019,0

89,"About a month ago I was walking to my house and saw a really friendly ginger tom cat, he was meowing for attention as I approached but I had my hands full and couldn't stop so I gave the little guy an air kiss on the way past and hoped I'd see him again some time.

Fast forward to a couple weeks later when I was just getting back to my house after a weekend away, and stopped to fish my keys out of my suitcase when I see the tom cat watching me from a neighbors wall a few doors down. I made a friendly gesture and he hopped over to me and spent about 5 or 10 minutes enjoying lots of pets and fussing, but it was raining and I wanted to get in the house and unpack so eventually I went on my way in. 

I live in a converted house share (that doesn't allow pets sadly) and my room is on the ground floor with a big bay window that is directly alongside the front entrance, so I could clearly see the tom cat still there. He hung around for nearly 10 minutes in the rain and I felt so bad but knew I couldn't let him in. He didn't wear a collar and seemed to have a few healing scabs in his fur probably from scuffles with other tom cats, but I didn't get the impression he was a stray - he seemed clean, well fed and very tame. Since then I've looked out for him whenever I come home or am walking on my street but haven't seen him at all.

It's been quite humid the last day or two so I had my window open all night, and while I've often daydreamed about the possibility of a curious cat coming in to hang out it's never happened since I've lived here. Plus the window I usually open is the one facing a road so probably wouldn't attract many wandering animals, or so I thought.

I have Wednesday mornings off work and was half asleep in bed at about 7 this morning when I heard the curtains rattling the ornaments on my windowsill, which I put down to a strong wind until something fell off and I sat up surprised to see a furry ginger tail poking out. I immediately reached over and moved the curtains aside and after some reassurance the tom cat jumped down to check out my room before hopping up onto the bed to say hello. I was still only semi-awake and not sure if I was dreaming but he was very happily purring away while I pet him, as I gradually laid down again he curled up and took a nap with me for a while until I had to get up.

With the upstairs tenants out I let him check out the house with me while I got breakfast, until I heard the maintenance man at the door with his keys and had to grab the poor guy and stash him back to my room. Shortly after he jumped onto my dressing table next to me as if to say bye and made his way back out of the open window.

I honestly feel so blessed to have made this unexpected new friend and hope it won't be the last time we have a surprise nap party. If only they let us keep pets here we could hang out more!",26Jun2019,1

92,"  I (34M) have never been a forgiving person, ESPECIALLY to myself. I have forgiven in the past of course, but that seems to be a natural process, something that didn’t require an effort or conscious choice in the past, but I would definitely say that is not the norm for me. I seem to be able to forgive my children easily enough (thank god for that), but I am not able to extend that forgiveness out for some reason, at least not consciously. As a result, there is a fair amount of crap I have been holding onto for years, and I think forgiving would be a good thing, but I don’t know how to do it when it doesn’t happen organically.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have read dozens of books on the subject, countless articles, and listened to lectures on the matter, none of that really has seemed to help except to pinpoint the specific areas I am still having trouble with (Which of course is something at least). Here are the sticking points I have run into.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Most of these articles and books are religious or spiritual in nature, and I am neither of these. So “turning a situation over to god or the universe” is just a weird and foreign concept. And the attitude of “karma or the universe will handle it” rings hollow to me, I have known far too many reprehensible people and seen them lead fairly charmed lives to believe that. 

&amp;#x200B;

2. The vast majority of the advice is some variation of “let go of it”, “release it”, “accept things as they are”, or some variation of this. I suppose this is probably where I have the biggest block. I don’t know how to choose to do this, I simply do not understand the steps or mental processes necessary to achieve that. It’s as if I handed someone who has never seen anything electronic an iPhone and told them to reboot it and when they say “how do you do that” I just keep rephrasing it (oh, just restart it, power cycle it, turn it off and on again, etc…). What I really need is the HOW behind this, so to continue the metaphor (You need to hold down the lock screen button for 10 seconds, release it, wait 60 seconds, and hold the lock screen button again for 10 seconds). 

&amp;#x200B;

3. I have never been a very empathetic person and apparently this is fairly important to the process. I have actually had a glimpse about how un-empathetic I am when I did shrooms once. During the trip I actually felt empathy on a level I never even knew was possible. Of course that wore off as the trip did and I can’t walk around tripping on mushrooms all the time. I have tried to get that feeling back naturally but I have just never been able to manage it.

&amp;#x200B;

4. I suppose another issue holding me back is I don’t know how to make myself believe that people DESERVE forgiveness, especially when I don’t expect to be forgiven if I screw something up with someone. I expect to be dropped and my reaction to that is “Yeah, I guess I deserved that.” I honestly don’t know how to change that mindset when it is one I have constantly applied my entire life, even to myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now some things I have been able to do, I can say “I forgive you” to someone and not ever bring up the transgression again after that, but it is still there. I won’t hold it over your head during a fight, I won’t bring it up whenever I am unhappy about something else, I can keep it fairly well suppressed to a point. But the feelings of hurt and even betrayal are still there, they still color my perceptions of the person, I never truly let it go. I have practiced empathy skills and can do a lot of the technical things that go along with it. I can put myself in that person’s shoes and understand WHY they did something, I can predict the actions of others if I know enough about them (something impossible to do without some level of empathy), but it is a totally different experience than the one I had on shrooms. The (for lack of a better word) emotional empathy just isn’t there, it is a totally logical and rational exercise. It’s like “Yes, I know you did X because you felt Y at the time” but the immediate feeling is still “But I don’t care, you still shouldn’t have done it”. 

&amp;#x200B;

So how do I get on in the world? Well simply put I am fairly good at repressing my emotions long enough to deal with someone for however long I have to. But if you’re someone who wronged me I generally only deal with you if I ABSOLUTELY have to. If you piss me off too many times I just walk away and wash my hands of you. I think this has a lot to do with my childhood, I was a Navy brat (child in a military family) and so we moved every 2-3 years on average. By the time I was having to deal with any built up issues my family were off and moving, so I believe the detach and “move on” method is how I learned how to deal with these kinds of issues. I never really had the opportunity to make any long term connections with anybody outside of my direct family (and even for them I can detach if they upset me enough, it is kind of scary how easy that is for me to do). In fact, my mother upset me pretty badly and I haven’t spoken to her in over a year at this point (and I just feel no urgency or need to change that at all). 

&amp;#x200B;

So the result of all of this nonsense is that as an adult I have no “friends” to speak of, I am friendly with people at work, maybe we go out to lunch once a month or something, but that is about the extent of it. I have a fair amount of self-loathing, I simply don’t know how to forgive myself for past mistakes, especially if I did something that I knew I really shouldn’t have at the time (this means to me I intentionally did a bad thing, why would I deserve forgiveness for this, it isn’t as if it was an accident). I beat myself up constantly for past mistakes. I have tried to stop dwelling on past mistakes but it really just takes an instant, it is a flash of “hey remember the time when you \_\_\_\_\_\_\_” and that’s all it takes. I will stop thinking about whatever it is but that “crappy feeling” just sticks with me for hours or the rest of the day. I can go read a book, or listen to music but that feeling just doesn’t go away quickly. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that this isn’t a healthy way to be in the world, I know that learning to forgive myself and others would be a million times better than the way I live now. I just don’t know how to do this; I guess on a technical level. I have tried therapy before and started going to another therapist just a few months ago, but the suggestions and solutions are pretty much the same as what I have read in books and online. I seem to get hung up on the same areas, and I just am not sure what to do at this point. Sorry for the novel above, I was trying to condense several years of self-examination as much as possible.  Any advice is welcome and I will be happy to answer questions.

&amp;#x200B;

96,"TLDR: After being incredibly stressed and unsure about what I want to research and write about in my final year project at university which spans all the way until I will be finishing my degree next summer, I think I finally found something I'm passionate enough about to work on

----

So basically as explained above, I think I've found a spark of inspiration as to which area I want to write my dissertation on next year. Unlike some other courses at other universities which provide a list of topics to choose from, my course requires us to come up with our own due to the many different fields within the social sciences and so that we each can delve into a project we can remain motivated to do research and read into over the course of the entire year. 

Well, like many people on my course, I chose it due it being so broad in nature and not having a clue as to what exactly I want to do in future, apart from wanting it to be meaningful and impactful on the world around me, and because the social sciences were of interest to me too. 

Unlike some of my friends however, I've been struggling to work out a specific topic I want to know more about, but today, literally less than an hour ago, it hit me. I realise a lot of my time over the past 18 or so months has been spent learning about health and nutrition as I aimed to overcome some personal struggles, and in that time I've discovered the many personal and social implications of diet-culture, eating disorders and body image, particularly in the realm of social media. So since I am already passionate about this, and using my free time to learn about the sociological and psychological impacts of living healthy and what it means to be healthy, it will be the perfect topic for me to delve deeper into. 

I don't quite have all the details worked out, but I really feel like I'm finally headed in the right direction. This may not be a huge deal for some, but to me it's so much more than just a dissertation topic; I finally feel like I have some sort of direction of the type of career I may want to choose if this project pans out well.",26Jun2019,2
97,"My computer has been completely shit ever since I bought it. I haven't ever been able to properly run Photoshop or Krita on Windows because it becomes overly slow. Therefore, I can't do my loved digital painting!

However, I discovered that Krita on Linux runs acceptably fast, so I switched to Linux a while ago. Linux is also wonderful because it takes 2 minutes to turn on and I'm ready to use it. Meanwhile, Windows takes about 15-20 minutes to turn on, won't run Krita or Photoshop properly and when there's a lot of processes, the keyboard writes weird (skips letters and mixes the order of some other letters).

In the end this means that Linux is much more comfortable to use, but I can't play League of Legends, which I miss a lot. So I turned on Windows today but it's so bothersome to turn it on and wait 15-20 minutes!

I'm very frustrated because I won't want to switch back to Linux, or if I do switch to Linux, I won't want to switch back to Windows, and so I'll be missing out on either LoL or drawing, and I want to do both! Aaaarrgghhhh!!",26Jun2019,1

To me this marks the beginning of getting to dive deep into my chosen major which excites me and makes me feel like my educational goals are achievable! :)",26Jun2019,3
102,"I want a girlfriend and I like this girl at camp with me. I use to be really confident when it comes to stuff like this. I always try to make sure I let no one intimidate me or make me anxious, but now when it comes to asking out girls I remember all the times I got rejected, or all the times I was led on, or all the times I was stood up on dates, and I start feeling like I'll never be good enough for the woman I want. I feel like I'm not rich or attractive or tall or strong or funny or smart enough, and I use to not care about those things when I was younger and I'd just ask out whoever. But after being stood up and made fun of and belittled SO MANY TIMES and never actually getting a girlfriend, I'm scared to put myself out there. I want a girlfriend,but as soon as I get the slightest message that she doesn't want me back I completely shut down. I don't chase anyone anymore because I don't want to get hurt in that way again, but at the same time I do want a girlfriend. I hate always feeling like I'll never be good enough for anyone. I want to get the confidence back that I use to have before I went through all those rejections,but I can't make that little voice that tells me im inferior go away. I don't want to keep on shutting down and saying ""ok whatever go find another man to be with"". I want to be confident enough to ask someone out and maintain that relationship, but I always feel like she's using me for something or will cheat on me or talk  bad about me behind my back about how weird or ugly I am as soon as she gets the chance. I know I shouldn't care and I should be tough,but it hurts me a lot when someone I actually care about ends up not valuing me at all. IDK what to do,but I want that old confidence back",26Jun2019,2

Then open the door to see the penguin in the bed, followed by another intrusive thought and anxiety flare up.

Go upstairs and be alone while everyone thinks about me in bad ways and hopes for my death or commitment.

105,Every day that has passed I have felt as if the air is being knocked out of me non stop. I feel my soul crushing at the thought of everything we once had. My brain keeps replaying every single event that has transpired since Thursday. Sunday killed me. Every minute that has passed since then i feel myself losing my sense of self. I am inconsolable. I am defeated. I don’t want to feel anything anymore.,26Jun2019,1
107,"Hi! So i created this account for advice on what to do with my life. I am currently majoring in Computer Engineering, but had to halt my studies due to a financial crisis. I am trying to figure out my options and see what i can do to straighten up my life. I have no family or anyone to help me. I am currently looking for a job since the place i worked at closed. I have submitted tons of applications online and have still not found a job. I find this surprising. I am well versed in many subjects and have lots of experience in Sales, Costumer Service, Electricity, and troubleshooting. I am a veteran and i no longer qualify for financial aid since i used my benefits. I only had partial benefits. I'm about to get evicted, and i'm still paying for my car. At this point i'm extremely concerned about what to do next. Its clear to me that finishing my school is my priority, which is what i'm attempting to do. I have a lot of student loan debt, and i don't mind getting more loans to pay off for school, except that my credit is not good at the moment. The more that i try and find an exit, the more things seem to be shutting down on me. right now the only gig that i have is working security on Saturdays and Sundays ..... I'm scared. I don't know what to do. I need life advice or someone to give me tips on how to pay for my school. 

&amp;#x200B;

For those wondering, I am 23 years old. 

Yes, i have applied for scholarships but have had no luck with any. 

Yes, I have approached veteran services and they have helped me somewhat (security weekend gig).

Yes, I have looked into loans and grants and am using fafsa.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently trying to get an IT job and am working on my CCNA. The only problem is that that requires time, and i dont have time since i'm about to get evicted and am looking for a full or part time job.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice Helps. I'm currently living in the DFW area if anyone knows of any jobs that are hiring, or any programs i may benefit from. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you.",26Jun2019,1
108,"I've been having a kinda fucked up time these past few months (all in my post history if curious, I just don't feel like rehashing) and have been feeling really super down on myself but today I got an email saying that an indie lit mag accepted three of my poems for publication in an upcoming anthology of theirs! This is my first writing acceptance since high school (just finished my first year of college) and it feels so nice to know that I haven't lost it in spite of the illness that's been screwing me over since March.

109,"i sold it, sold my soul to the devil, said

""you don't need your heart""

say, did you know that Christopher Columbus founded America in 1492

Say, he marched onto the shores with his army and found Winston Churchill having a cuppa?

Say, they joined forces and wrote all the history books to prevent us from knowing the truth,

Say, do you want to know the truth about America?

Say, do you want to know the truth about the world wars?

Say, do you want to know the truth about why JFK was assassinated?

Say, do you want to know the truth about why politics is the way it is?

Say, do you want to know the truth about how little we actually know?

""WHAT WE KNOW IS A DROP, WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS AN OCEAN."" - ISAAC NEWTON

OK, let me explain everything. It all started with outer space. Do you really think we are the first humans in outer space?

Let me turn your attention to the Chicxulub Crater that ""Hit Earth"" 66 million years ago. It made the dinosaurs extinct. A coincidence?

Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm?

And tell me, our earth is how old? What's that? 4.5 billion years, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm?

And what happens to be 450 divided by 66? About 7, is that it?

Now that I have laid upon you the fundamental truths of our history, allow me to propose ""The Fundamental Theorem of Terrible Societies""

If we grew up never seeing a banana, and nobody ever taught to us what a banana is, the collective human race would have no idea a banana may exist. There could be one person hiding all the bananas. That is to say ""What isn't known cannot be learned."" That is unless there is an entity that has already learned.

Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm, say, does this sound fair?

IN MY NEXT POST, I WILL REVEAL A FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH OF OUR SOCIETY.

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm tight (around my arm I think like holding might have been nothing) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the tall cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery and  quickly said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and full on  smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then look away to carry on putting her scarf on.",26Jun2019,0
111,"I've always had several good friends all my life. I used to hang out with friends alot on my free time, almost every day.

But as time went on, more and more of them started to meet other people (we used to hang out together). 

It's right before summer break and alot of my friends are hanging out with other people and often when i would ask it would be something like ""Sorry im having a sleepover with someone""  That just made me feel very uninvited, like no one wanted me there. That whole summer no one ever asked me to hang out, i asked them a few times and some times  it was a yes, but i feel like they did it because they didnt want to have a fight or felt bad. I usually saw on snapchat and simular stuff people posting about them having a sleepover or hanging out with the people i used to hang out with. Everyone is there, exept for me. The problem is not that im not nice or something, im generally very well behaved, i never had a fight with enyone, we usually have fun when we do hang out, but everything just slipped out of my hands. The cooming winter this just kept on going, each time making me more sad. I usually dont cry but its getting more common, i just keep all of this inside of me, wich makes me more and more sad. Wich obviously doesnt help the situation. As spring come im also starting to see my friends not opening my texts or snaps, or not just responding. Nothing has changed yet and i feel it has to pretty soon. Summer break just started and i really dont know what to do. And at this point as the title says i feel kind of ashamed for asking people to hang out, I cant really explain why. I think its because i feel they dont want to hang out. I need some drastic changes pretty soon before this starts effecting all of my life.

112," I’m a guy and I was working as a waiter on a quiet midweek day and I was taking finished plates back to the kitchen when I felt a stare and immediately looked to my right and 1 of these 3 girls was smiling/smirking at me and looked me down at my side/arm when I looked at her   (im tall and lanky and my arms looked a little bit big too because I was had a few layers on underneath is that laughable?)  it was for about 3 seconds and then as I walked out of sight I heard a slight noise (couldn’t make it out) a bit later 2 of them were ordering food at the bar and  on their way back I felt a stare while I was standing at the kitchen gantry bored and looked over to one of them girls (the blonde friend of the girl who smiled at the start) on her own walking back to her table looking over at me and when I noticed  she laughed hard and put her hand to her mouth still looking at me then I looked away. I immediately got upset about if and I went to my team leader and assistant manager and refused to take their food to them I wanted them kicked out but my team leader wouldn't coz he said I can't be sure they were making fun of me. later on I had to check the toilets and I walked upstairs to girls toilets and the door opens and it was them girls I looked up and the girl that laughed earlier smiled at me, and I overheard em saying whys a boy going in girls toilets and walked past me as normal. They were pleasant looking girls tbh. I’m a guy btw",26Jun2019,0

But with the substance abuse gone I don't know what i'm saving my money for. 

Feeling lonely, idk. But I work 6 days a week there's no time to go on dates. Meet someone. Do activities. It's nice that things are lookin up and people even flirt with me at work which makes me think there must be oppourtunity but idk, if I wanna talk i'm still coming to r/self / reddit and just typing a paragraph to myself. 

Feeling lonely, idk. 

I kinda wanna cry but that's kinda pathetic.

Maybe it's because I had a stella after work. Not much for alcohol but, it's okay. I feel a little different. But I don't want more. I just want a person here, feels like it'd never happen.

I don't know.

I guess I just carry on and keep progressing as I get older; just hope. Hope.

At least there's video games, dogs, the odd stella and good food and exercise. Music. God i've become such a normie. Enjoying normal things. I can't tell if it's good or sad.",26Jun2019,3
