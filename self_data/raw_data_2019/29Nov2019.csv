It’s annoying because I feel like it defines me and it’s the first thing people look at. I also know that it’s going to be there for the rest of my life. 

I’m trying to learn to accept it. It’s going to be a long battle but I’ll get there :)",29Nov2019,1
1,"My life is terrible. I'm fighting suicide. I have a method planned and prepared to use at any moment. I've been getting professional help and trying to change my life for 7 out of my 21 years and have never seen even the smallest improvement. 


If you drew a line graph of my life with time on the x axis and quality of life on the y, the graph would just be a steady line down, not even any spikes upward. Nothing has been ok since I was probably 13.

4,"So idk how my life changed so fast but 3 years ago i had a lot of friends i had a girlfriend and life was amazing, every day was different. I'm 27 years old male and now all of my friends live in other countries and they come home only 1 or 2 times a year, my girlfriend of 6 years that is now my ex broke up with me last January saying these exact words : I don't love you anymore but i still want you to be part of my life as a close friend because we have spent a lot of time together and i'll still miss you. A month later after she said these words she was already in a new relationship and forgot about me. My only close friend who haven't left the country is plaing to do it this year. The only 2 people calling on my phone every day or two are my mother and the friend that's about to leave the country too, my father calls me too, but i don't think he cares about me too much. No one texts me, no one is calling me. Ok i do get some calls from work like once a month (and thats actually excites me ). At this point when i hear a text or a buzz coming i know it's either from my internet provider or some stupid friendship suggestion from facebook. I live alone and sometimes all i want is to talk to someone when i'm at home. I want to have someone to share my meal with or watch tv or to tell how my day was. All i do is going to work and getting back home ( oh yeah i started training 2 weeks ago and i like it so far ). At one moment i feel fine and happy it's like my mind has build that big barrier that nothing can get trough and hurt me or make me sad. And a moment later i feel sad and i just want to crawl into a ball and cry until i have no tears left. I have no one to go out with when i'm not at work, so i just stay home or go outside alone and observe what people do and i envy at how happy some of them look, i envy how some of them hold hands or drink beer together. The only new and positive thing that happend to me recently is that i've met someone new ( a new coworker ) and she is great. I find her to be very funny, charming and cute. And yes i have a tiny bit of hope that something between us might happen ( yes i know she is a coworker but i don't give a damn about it at this point in my life ) I even pray to whatever power there is out there something between us to happen, because i want a change in my life, i want to feel the excitement of waking up knowing that the day will be different and full of joy.  

Excuse my english. I'm not living in a english speaking country and i can't spell every word correctly. So anyway that's my story, i hope you guys have great lifes full of happines :)",29Nov2019,1

r/self, you all are amazing people.


Tonight, my Reddit account was doxxed. Not by some random person online; it was by someone involved in a breakup I had several months ago. I’m not sure how they got my Reddit account, or why they felt the need to send it around or blackmail me with it, but they did. 


My friends, family, and a good part of my small town now know about my past struggles with depression, anxiety, and self-image. They also now know my political views, my favorite musicians, and every single shitpost I’ve ever made on r/CFB. 


While this has been extremely upsetting, it’s also made me realize how far I’ve come. I’m happy now, I’ve more or less accepted myself, and I’ve surround myself with people that love me. 


With that being said, if you’re reading this post after someone gave you my Reddit username, **fuck off**. I’ll save you the time: it’s just a bunch of football banter and shitty memes, with some embarrassing posts about myself sprinkled throughout. I’m not that interesting of a person. If I’m going to be embarrassed about anything, it’s going to be the fact that I chose the name u/ugafan2148, and not something more interesting.",29Nov2019,1
7,"It's the first Thanksgiving with my husband, instead of spending it with him in our new home I'm at work and he's at home in bed watching the History channel. We're of course talking to each other. He's telling me what's going on with the show and I'm telling him about the interesting things I find on Reddit. I miss him still.

But.... I'm happy. We recently moved from being 30 minutes of interstate away from my job (he hated the commute to my job so he never came) to 10-15 minutes of quiet road away so he's coming up here in a little bit to watch a holiday movie with me and eat some cake my boss brought. 

My family has never been big on celebrating holidays together, which I love - we call each other and check in but that's enough for us, and his family is the same way so there was no disappointing families because of my work schedule (I get no holidays off at all unless they're on the weekend) or fussing with my husband about whose house we'll go to when or convincing our families that we want to have Thanksgiving at our house because it's our first one and all that.

Holidays just seem so chaotic and stressful and it really makes me happy that there are no standing family traditions that we have to compete with in order to make our own, you know? This morning we slept in and had a bigger breakfast than we normally do and then watched a movie before I had to leave for work. It was heaven.

And yeah, it sucks I can't be at home spending time with him but I'm making holiday pay today and tomorrow which is going to be absolutely amazing because there's so much we want/need to do to our house still. 

So. I'm happy.",29Nov2019,1
8,"It's really soft and comfy. it makes me feel like I'm being hugged by a teddy bear. I always have second thoughts about buying things I don't absolutely need at the moment, and I get anxious when I even consider unnecessary junk. I talk myself out of a lot of things.

Growing up poor makes me constantly count up my expenses and fret over money. When I look at things like a Nintendo Switch, one part of me dreams of playing Animal Crossing and another part of me calculates rent. I wish things didn't have to be this way.

17,"Here's some basic info about me so you can understand the picture. I am a girl. I'm Chinese on my dads side. My dads parents immigrated here from china and he was born in the U.S, making me a second generation. I look white as hell. My eyes and lips are big and my hair is brown. In sixth grade, I realized that I found people who are asian more attractive than people of other races. From there, the problems started.

Now I have an entire obsession with becoming more asian. I tried forcing myself to watch anime, but gave up. I found it boring, and it was full of filler. I've enjoyed a few manga series and adore studio Ghibli, but that's all. However, I still buy anime merchandise when I can, and know all the basics. I try to visit Chinatown with any of my asian friends as much as possible, because then I feel secure being there. I know I don't belong, but I feel better when I order bubble tea, buy an egg waffle, etc when they're there. I got into Kpop and actually enjoy it, so I make an effort to keep up with the news about it. I think that all of that behavior is troublesome, but the worst thing I've done is taken pictures of asian men and women on public transit or on the street without their consent, I keep the pictures under hidden, and avoid looking at them.

One of my asian friends took me to a small basketball court in chinatown where all of her friends were. there were about 20 people there playing sports or just talking to friends. If felt like the secret hangout place in a novel. Everyone knew everyone, and they were all so fucking pretty that it hurt. It's the kind of group I'll never be a part of. After I had gotten home, I realized I felt extremely sad. It was like there was a hollowness inside and I was partially numb.

I hate myself for all of this. I hate feeling like an insecure fake every time I'm in chinatown alone. I hate my unhealthy obsession, but I can't tell any of my friends the whole story. I've told them a small piece of it, but I won't ever say more. I know they would be disgusted, and most of my friends are asian as well so that's the cherry on top. I'll never be asian enough for myself. I can't do Kpop dances, can barely count to five in mandarin, and I will never look like I want to. I'm just some knockoff version of what I want to be.",29Nov2019,1

19,"The last time I had a good Thanksgiving let alone a good holiday was 2013

My mom has verbally abused me on Thanksgiving, Christmas, my birthday, 4th or July, Easter, and all holidays since 2014

“You’re fucking 14 now, now that your brother is here you’re no longer important and you can’t celebrate Easter” was the one that hit me the hardest

Since then I’ve just celebrated holidays either in my room, on my computer, or sitting with my uncle

This year I have choose to spend it in the bathroom crying...

I’m considered the unloved child of the family, the only ones who ever loved me are my aunt (dad’s sister), uncle (mom’s brother), my bio father and stepfather, my stepsister, my biofather’s wife, my 6 year old half sister, and my great great grandmother’s grand niece... I’m super grateful for all of them at least..❤️

I'm thinking about forgiving people I never thought I would have had the strength or interest to before.

I'm finding hobbies and passions I had as a kid and it's like they are brand new again.

I'm socializing more.

I'm getting opportunities that I never thought would happen for me.

I'm setting personal boundaries without fear of rejection.

I'm learning.

I'm connecting the dots of my past in a way that takes the power away from them over me.

I'm wanting to help others heal.

I'm feeling more creative.

I'm remembering what it feels like to be happy and hopeful.

I'm reconnecting with those who helped me along the way and they are overjoyed.

I'm forgiving myself for not healing faster.

I'm communicating better.

I want to tell the world that it's real. The ""trusting the work"" thing. It's not BS. I promise. With more safety in my life, more resources than before, and the desire to heal as a focus, it's like a really, REALLY light mist has been lifted from my eyes.

27,"I’ve liked a co worker for some time. One night after a work party, we talked all night and eventually hooked up. Now my situation is complex because I recently hit hard times, and moved in with my parents while I do this job and figure myself out. He also separated from his wife and is living on a friends couch while he figures himself out. But now I’m afraid. I’ve had casual flings and one night stands, but this one felt different. Our thoughts on love and relationships aligned perfectly. We don’t like boyfriend and girlfriend labels, we just want to be bodies that exist together.

I had my heart broken terribly once. It really caused me to build a guard, it made me realize I wasn’t meant for relationships with linear labels. What I want is companionship, a lover. Someone who doesn’t feel tethered by me nor I them. But who cares about me, thinks of me, and would be there for me as much as I them. He agreed and it caught me so off guard because usually I’m met with weird looks. And when he elaborated, I knew he understood. I just wish I wasn’t developing feelings. Our situations are unclear and messy, but after countless relationships for the for the first time it’s like someone genuinely gets me. I just hope at least we can be friends. I haven’t spoken to him since or tried to. After all he’s separated and I’d rather not come between anything or get hurt. Plus in my nervousness to follow these feelings he hasn’t reached out. It’s just weird for the first time I feel like wanting to get to know this person inside and out. He’s interesting to me. I just hope he sees a friend in me too. This is beyond physical attraction, it’d be a shame to lose someone who is talented and full of knowledge.

But in the end this will probably just be another casual fling, just odd that suddenly this one sticks out in my mind.",29Nov2019,1

It's free exposure for the charity and gets them donations they otherwise would not have got and Facebook doesn't take any of the cut.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidebanis/2018/10/29/the-problem-with-facebook-birthday-fundraisers/

And yet, despite the fact that it's a system that generates donations for charity at essentially no cost, people like this guy still find a way to complain about it. I get his point about prioritization, but that doesn't make every fundraising attempt mute or unhelpful. Furthermore, does it really matter why a person decides to donate or not? Even if it's purely for selfish reasons to make themselves look better, at the end of the day it means more clothes on children's backs, less homeless people and more food, so who gives a shit?

Sorry for the minor rant, I just googled the donation thing to see if there was any sort of catch, and I came across this article and got angry.",29Nov2019,1
29,"Okay so. 



I have a pretty heavy period as of late and I’m regularly leaking from my pads when I sleep. I’ve gone through so many panties and even pajama pants and atleast 2 sheets because of this. It’s really annoying and I’m not sure what to do. 

I really wanna sleep with my tampons in but my mother always warned me against it. Made it sound like I was gonna die if I did. 

So I was just wondering if it actually is dangerous to sleep in tampons nowadays - considering they don’t really use cotton anymore so the chances of toxic shock syndrome is really diminished. 
*specifically the Tampax brand of tampons*

If it’s not recommended what are some things that have worked for you guys to save your cloths and panties for that dreaded week a month. Preferably that’s comfortable to sleep with. I tried that cup thing and I couldn’t stand it - plus the insertion process is just gross to me. (No shame to anyone who uses it, I just couldn’t stand how messy my hands got - maybe I needed more practice but I didn’t like it) 

My friend recommended having specific panties and pants for these nights. But blood stained cloths are just nasty to me. Even if they are washed or black or whatever, I’m really anal about it and always end up throwing anything blood stained away.

So any suggestions? Is it safe to sleep with tampons in?",29Nov2019,1

growing up, it's not that my brother and i were raised in a generally bad environment or even a bad home. we grew up in upper-middle class america where all of our basic \[financial\] necessities were there. we were taught to be nice to everyone and to help others and i like to think that my brother and i are ""good kids"" and we are... but we're also no stranger to trouble / drama. we are not afraid of authority or people in general. fighting, police, being arrested multiple times, DUI, drugs, sneaking girls in and out of the house... etc. we never stole and we never did anything ""bad"" but people knew not to fuck with us. we have since grown up but omg we were little punks. we were such douchebags and i think we still are a bit lol but way more polished, now we're just super confident.

these days, my brother's 35 and owns a very successful real estate company and i work for him and make a very handsome salary while still learning the business. we live a nice life.

there's nothing i hate more than that girl who is the ""life of the party"" (best description i have) because that's already in my personality traits.

i want to date a good girl who is a nerd and i want my kids to be that same way. i was seeing a girl recently who would send me snaps of her reading a science book captioned ""gotta love science!"" i love those little things. she was quite younger than me (20) which i think is why it didn't work out but i could tell who she was in high school. she was a dork i could tell instantly thats who she was. she commented once that i've been ""drinking a lot recently"" which was totally true and told me that i'm not as sweet to her when i drink. we lacked chemistry sometimes though and the sex wasn't great.

anyway.. i just don't really want my kids to be a troublemaker like i was. i want them to be a little different and not hang out with the kids i hung out with. i want their friday nights to consist of drinking beers and smoking weed with their dorky friends who are harmless, rather than going to that packed out house party where 16 year old girls are trashed and sucking their crushes dick in the bathroom. i want them to be a little shy and have a son who's a little scared of talking to girls but still manages.. etc you get what i mean.",29Nov2019,1

This hurt WAY more than any breakup I've ever had, I knew a relationship was uncertain but she was supposed to stay in my life, she was my best friend and we called each other ""sisters"", then she left the second she got married. 

I want to forget and move on but she insists on acting like nothing happened, sometimes (very rarely) she texts back, we talk for like a day and then goes ghost again. 

The other day I checked Facebook after months of not going there and I saw a post of hers on my time-line saying something cheesy about best friends, after ignoring me for almost a year. 

I've been getting really petty about it and I know i shouldn't be, I posted a story of me and my current best friend with a caption like ""I miss you BFF!)"", like how fucking old am I? She did saw it tho and I felt weirdly satisfied. 

Today I accidentally watched one of her stories and she's getting married (she already was legally but never on a church and all that stuff), what baffles me is that she still says online that I'm her best friend when she never talks to me, ignores my texts and doesn't even invites me to her wedding... 

I know I should block her but I don't wanna seem salty (even though I already am), when her posts appear on my time-line it affects me, it's bad for my mental health and she's not even the person that used to be my friend, she changed for bad and I can't see me hanging out with her anymore, she's a complete stranger and I miss my old friend.

46,"Having a thanksgiving with my boyfriends family made me realized how dysfunctional my family is. 
I come into their house, dining room so nice, plates well candles lit, everyone talking joking, 1940-50s music is soft in the background while kids run around the house. Older people drink wine and talk not even gossip just about life. Everyone is cooking (not just the women too!) I felt so at home. 
I come in feeling welcomed (well I don’t know if it’s some fake respectful thing) but it didn’t seem like it at all and I loved it. I met everyone and everybody and myself and my boyfriend just say and relaxed for a while. 
Later on we went on to help in the kitchen. That’s when it was started to hit me, everyone was in the kitchen cooking talking while the kids wined about the amount of time we took on cooking, again the music is playing while I’m helping mix the bowl of batter, my boyfriend beside my cracking eggs. I felt at... home for the first time, I didn’t want it to end I didn’t want to leave, I wish I could feel the happiness I felt in their home 24/7, I wanted to cry out of joy but of course I didn’t. Today’s experience was amazing and I never felt this feeling before.

Just a couple of minutes ago I unmuted it not thinking much of it until I saw a video of her with another guy in a car with the caption saying ""Spending time with this cutie."" For a minute I broke down and asked myself how could she do that to me, I thought I did everything right and I was trying my hardest to win her back. I called my best friend and we talked about it.

52,"Before  you say ""They're still your family"", please read on. And I don't  believe I don't have the right to cut ties from toxic family.

When I was a kid, I was staying with my grandmother, where she took care of me until the age of 13, where she passed away.

So  my parents had to bring me back home. I have an older brother, and all  along, he was staying with my parents. So when I come back home, and he  had to share a room with me, he wasn't happy. The reason why my parents  left me at my grandmother's place was that my brother, who was 7 years  older than me, demanded a room of his own. And they obliged. Please bear  in mind; my parents did not give any money to my grandmother to take of  me. She has all along used her life savings to keep us both alive and  well, including the fees for school.

At  this point, I was staying with my parents, and they told me to drop out  of school and get a job. Which I did, to pay whatever I need to feed  myself, and to pay off school loans.

When  I was around 15, my parents told me to move out if not I have to pay  for MY electricity bills, MY share of the room and MY water bill, please  note that my brother did not have to pay a single cent.

As I was paying to support myself and to pay off school loans, I give in to pay my ""room rental"" fee to my parents.

When I was 17, My parents told me to give them food allowances, each 300, so by now, it's a total of 600 + ""rental fees.""

When  I was 20, My dad, who has a gambling habit, has gone overboard during  one of his casino debt and has reached out to me, ONLY, to help him pay  off, which i did. But before I do, I argued why don't he ask my brother  too? We can split the financial burden between us, like 50/50, and he  said no, he doesn't have enough for himself.

Bringing  forward today, I am 25, my brother needs money to bail him out of jail,  hire lawyer etc., because of some illegal shit he's doing, and my mom  came crying to me and asked me to help him else he's going to jail. And  she guilt trip me by telling, ""He's your brother! You can't turn a blind eye to your family!""

And I told  her, this will be the last time I help you all out financially because  apparently, I'm nothing but an ATM to you all. I will help this one last  time because I'm tired already. And I proceed to deal with those shit,  and I legally disowned them.

(Since  I was 13 I have to keep changing jobs, but the same job scope, same  industry, and I am so good at what I'm doing and hence at 20, I was  already a B2B, B2C, Telemarketing, and PR trainer. Therefore, I was able  to survive. But way before that, I held three part-time jobs so that I  can pay off my school loans)

Thanks for reading. I want to let it off because today is the day they signed  the papers. I never felt like this before. It's such a relief, but I do  feel a little bad, like what if I'm going too extreme. But maybe I will  get used to it soon.",29Nov2019,1

***IMPORTANT BACKSTORY:***

Almost three months ago I had a major argument with a friend, let's call her Karen. This argument led to the end of our friendship. After the argument, she blocked my profile on Instagram.

Karen worked in a bar, a really shitty one. Every time I went to that place, I saw things that were not right. One time the bar was invaded by flies. Another time, a guy wearing only underwear came in and lit a cigarette (note that in Italy smoking is prohibited inside every public building). Moreover, Karen never smiled and always replied with a grumpy attitude to customers, and one time she fled outside leaving the bar unattended when a wasp flew inside.

Since I always review every place I go, I reported all of that in a 1-star review on both Google Maps and Tripadvisor, writing it from an objective standpoint. Before the argument with Karen, I refrained from writing the review since she was my friend and she was working there, but now I had no reason to not write it.

***THE EVENTS:***

Yesterday Karen found out about my review, so she decided to post a handful of Instagram stories, consisting in a screenshot of my review, a few explanations to justify her behavior and to save the bar's reputation, some heavy insults directed to me and my cleverness (she's lucky that she mentioned only my name and not my surname, otherwise I could've sued her for slander), and lastly her asking for public's approval. I couldn't see her Instagram stories since she blocked my profile, but some of my friends made screenshots and sent them to me.

There's just one little problem: as the title says, Karen accidentally proved me right.

One of her justifications was that *""in that bar there have always been flies, and it's normal that they fly inside if they leave the windows open""*. The other justification was that, that time when she fled outside because of the wasp, she was indeed outside the bar but she stayed in front of the entrance. She basically confirmed what I said in my review.

Karen also didn't mention anything about the underwear smoker, and this basically is another tacit confirmation of what I wrote in the review.

Last but not least, while insulting me, Karen publicly admitted that she blocked my profile. She practically badmouthed herself, because the impression she now gives to everyone is that she is a devious person who badmouths other people behind their back.

Well done Karen, well done! Instead of digging your own grave, I suggest you grow up a little bit. You're 20 years old and you gave birth to a beautiful baby-girl 2 years ago, so you should stop having such childish behavior.

64,"(I wrote my thoughts and emotions down, which came up while writing and thinking about this, so this text is written in a messy way and it may be hard to understand. I wrote this text down for myself, so i can clear my mind :-) )



I was a hardcore atheist, who didn‘t believed in god, magic, karma, chakra etc. 
One reason was,that there were no objective evidence to proof these supernatural things and events.Religious person saw their subjective experiences as a proof for their faith, but i refused to see them as real arguments for their believed, because subjective experiences are always wrong, so i thought.Only objective facts were the truth for me. Feelings were only a disturbance to my „rational mind.“

I was a extreme science freak.

My rationality made me in contrast to my peers an open minded person, who questioned a lot of things(for example my religion, national pride, purpose of life, etc.).

But whenever i questioned the purpose of life(or truth), i always came to the same conclusion: there is no reason to live( there is no truth). It made me nihilistic.

I mean, why should i live?
For a god that doesn‘t exist?
For friends and family, who are unsignificant to life, because they are also lonely mortal beings on a ball, moving around another hot ball  ?
For one of many countries, which are artificial structures made by man, full of errors and not absolute ?
 
Why should i train my body?
Why should i go to university?
Why should i do anything?

We don’t have a free mind, so we are not even in control in ourselves.
Every thought and action is preordained.
Every feeling is only a chemical reaction in our brain, so why bother searching warmth and security by other people? 
(Ok i stop my questions)
The point that fucked me up was, that we humans cant find the absolute truth of our existence and as a nihilist,  i was extremely convinced of that idea.( and that all other opinions on that matter were wrong for me).

But when there is no absolute truth, who says that my nihilistic position is right?

I mean, a religious person would defend his view on life with the same will and conviction as a nihilist would do.

The religious person may ignore science, but science isnt the answer all problems in our world. It cant improve our emotional wellbeing.

Science may be good for explaining,how our world works but not why(=the truth).

So in my opinion, all nihilist are only watching the scientific watch and fall into a dark void, because they are only approving evidence based arguments. And only science can bring real evidence.
And most people think, that science solves all our problems, because our outer world improved a lot( industrial revolution, modern medicine,etc.).

But as i already said, science doesnt really care about our inner emotional world.

The emotional world in us is irrational and doesn’t care about science.
In fact we are all emotional ridden creatures.

So when we are trying to find rational answers to our emotional problems, we will fail.

We all should find our personal belief and faith with irrationality. At the end, you cannot find your own truth with objective facts, but with your emotions. 

Thats why im not an atheist anymore and more of an agnostic.

Science and rationality is for me not the only way, i measure the world. Eastern religion and other irrational ways to experience our world are equated with rationality and science.

And thats, so i hope, the way out of my nihilism.

67,"So I’m 21, a virgin, all that usual shit. I think I’ve honestly just been kind of unlucky, there’s been people interested over the years and chances that I’ve kind of got too scared of and pulled out of, or noticed someone’s flirting with me and getting too nervous, etc. In the past year or so more and more of these chances have been cropping up so I felt like it was just a matter of time until something happened.

Anyway, I matched with this girl on tinder from a neighbouring city. Got talking a little, and I wouldn’t even say we hit it off majorly, but there was a little flirting going on, and eventually she suggested we should meet up and get drinks or something. She lives a bit far away, but she said she was willing to get the train to my city I’m in as long as I show her a good time and go to her if we go on a second date. We arranged a day and time, so all good, although I’ve never even been on a date so even that had me nervous.

After that though she was saying that she doesn’t mind just staying over at my place after, and when I told her that it’s probably not gonna happen cause my parents will be in (it’s way more normal to be in your parents house at this age here in the UK lmfao), she was like ‘don’t worry, I can be very quiet’. I just kind of laughed it off and said we’ll definitely go out though, and she said ‘no stress or anything, we can even get a hotel room for the night if we want to’.

So basically, there’s a really big chance she wants to hook up with me. And I’m facing the prospect of both my first date and maybe losing my virginity on the same night. The thing is, for some reason I’m still not sure about all this, and I can’t tell if it’s a bad idea or I’m just overthinking it all and psyching myself out.

Like the fact she was so forward about it all kind of caught me off guard cause that almost never happens to me. That might just be a lack of confidence making me think there must be some kind of ‘catch’, but still. She’s definitely not a catfish as far as I can tell: I added her on her socials, and while there aren’t many posts, she has tons of followers she’s clearly went to school with and shit, like she’s a real person. It just feels kind of iffy for some reason. Like kind of ‘too good to be true’ that some girl I find hot wants to hook up with me so bad that she’s instantly prepared to hop on a train for half an hour and come see me. But maybe that’s just me.

I don’t know. I think part of it is that, on paper, the idea of meeting some random girl or a casual date and just hooking up with them seems great in my head, but the handful of times I’ve been faced with it actually maybe being a reality, I kind of freeze up and get scared about it. Especially for a first time. Like what if it becomes blatantly obvious I don’t know what I’m doing or something, and it becomes awkward and plain bad? But on the other hand, most people’s first time is shitty, and at this point I honestly just want to get it out the way so that when I do meet someone I really, really like, I have a bit of experience.

So, I don’t know what to do. Do I just go for it? I think I’ll go on the date at least regardless, it’s just if things progress to us maybe hooking up I don’t know what’s best, but I know my nerves about all these firsts and being anxious about it will be clouding my judgment and make me want to take the ‘easy’ way out by cancelling. So, I need a second opinion. Am I being stupid about it all and overthinking what could be a good opportunity for me, or am I right to have reservations about it all? I really do want to lose my virginity so it’s not such a crutch for me anymore, but I just don’t know if this is the way to go about it.",29Nov2019,1
68,"My bedroom is very small. It's pokey. Like a deluxe room at a Japanese pod hotel. Everything has to be very tidy and in its place to make it look like I don't sleep in a charity shop store room, where they keep all surplus stock not good enough to have out on the racks.

I sleep on a top bunk bed because I stripped the bottom bunk out to make space for my piano and cupboards. Total walking space in my bedroom - a modest 3m². Ideal for moments of circular contemplation.

I was telling my boss about all this recently. She's a lovely woman. Very thoughtful and accommodating, appreciative, caring and happy. And she likes to enjoy a nice craft beer at the end of the day.

He worked on their property doing minimal things and my mom became attached to him because of her empty nest (both my sibling and I live very far away). 

She started feeding him, driving him around, clothing him and soon enough he was living in their home. He would cry about his parents in front of mine and they acted as an emotional crutch. He lived with them for months.

One weekend, my parents went away and left the person in the house (which was not uncommon). When they came back he was gone and 25K worth of items were missing. He robbed the house and very valuable, personal items.

The police haven’t done much and are reputed to be the worse in our state. There is video footage of him taking their things. Several items were found in pawn stores and the pawn slips had his friends’ identification. He still hasn’t been arrested.

My parents feel violated and are scared to leave the house in case he comes back or worse, with a group of friends. He knows the house very well and the police haven’t arrested him yet.

74,"Last week I went to a drama club with my friend, I am planning to go next week.  
The age ranges are 12-18, and one singular individual, for some reason, left a very off feeling with me. Both myself, and my friend, for a matter of fact.  
He was 18, had quite strange body language- perhaps this is my subconscious speaking, but I feel off about this so much so I don't feel particularly keen on going again.  
I am quite an intuitive person, so considering when we left- amid casual conversation my friend goes 'I had a weird feeling about so and so...I don't know why' to which I concurred. We didn't gossip about him- and it was very brief.  
I also want to note my friend is autistic, so social cues to her perhaps are a tiny bit limited...  
Should I stick with my gut instinct? I still want to go, I never feel like this with anybody, really- and as I have said, I am very intuitive.   
Anecdotes would be appreciated! :)",29Nov2019,1
75,so my husband and i both have severe depression and anxiety. We've been struggling for a long time and because of that we don't always do what productive adults do. Last week our apartment complex needed to come into our apartment. They then sent us a lease violation notice for clutter. Yesterday we spent thanksgiving deep cleaning out years and years of bullshit. I'm ashamed at what it was before but I'm so proud of what we did. I'm sore everywhere and my anxiety is at almost manic levels but we passed our inspection and we're not getting evicted and honestly I'm fucking thrilled.  I know we still have work to go but it's going to be ok. All week I thought it wouldn't be but it is.,29Nov2019,1

So i’m gay (not out) and i’ve developed a crush to a guy on the swim team. He has been really nice to me and is just a really great person. He’s cute but he’s not  like the hottest guy in the class. He’s new here and it’s his first year at my school. 

It feels like butterflies whenever i talk to him and i can’t stop thinking about him.

81,"And I mean *all* of them, not just the usually eugenics subjects like schizophrenics and bipolars. I mean whenever somebody falls into a depression and no longer functions in society, they should be euthanized. They simply aren't meant for the world.

""But what if they recover?""

Nobody really recovers from mental illness. They can ""get better"" but they'll 100% get worse again and make everybody's life terrible.

""Well they still have rights.""

Maybe they shouldn't. If somebody can't even get out of bed in the morning (the easiest thing in the world), acts like they are on crack for weeks at a time, or hears voices they think are god talking to them then maybe they aren't quite fit to wield human rights. All types of laws of amendments and exceptions regarding the mentally ill. There should be more of these that allow them to be killed. Wouldn't be hard to do.",29Nov2019,1
82,"I've never thought this could happen really. I've always been a happy person, barely ever felt that words could get to me. I always hung out with people with good vibes but my new classmates dont seem to have any of them. They're mostly the crazy and outgoing vibes. So recently my classmate(lets call him Cob) began interrupting my conversations with ""Wow cool story bro no one cares"" and when I tell a light hearted joke, ""Look around you, no one thinks you're funny, stfu"". Now, all my life, i've surrounded myself with people who's always smiley and cheerful, we'd embrace each other's shitty jokes and it was overall a very good feeling. This new batch of classmates dont do any of that. They're very judgemental about every single detail and can't take jokes. I'll be chilling one day doing my own stuff and Cob would come up to me and go ""Lol you're balding, balding fk"" and that's never nice to hear, not to a 17 year old trying to fit in. When I retaliate with ""Yea its from the stress, but that'll grow back, you can never fix your face"" as a joke, he gets all worked up and pull out the ""Look man no one's laughing at that joke just stfu"". Then everytime i try to talk, he tells me i have no right to talk because im balding??? At this part of the story, I wasn't actually balding, my hair is just thin enough to see the scalp but not thin enough to be considered balding or thinning. But because of all these comments, my hair began falling more than usual and the strands are much much more thinner. I'm gonna take a break from that group and especially Cob because I deserve to be happy, and I know it would disappoint my real friends so much to know that my years of trust and happiness have been broken down by some idiot with terrible social skills and punchable face.

I know I have a small handful of people (husband, mom, some work and childhood friends) that might say differently but man these thoughts have been so strong. Not to the point of wanting to do anything serious like take my own life but to the point where I'm really weighed down by the sadness of those thoughts. 

I think about some of the friends I've had over the years and how people seemed to gravitate towards them, whether it was their personality or sense of humor. And I just don't feel like I have those qualities. As if I could blend into the shadows and no one would really notice. I'm so thankful for my life and for all the ways people have shown their love for me so it feels really shitty that I even have these thoughts. Anyway, I'm rambling.

It has been years since I have “done anything wrong” but the guilt and regret won’t leave. I am constantly afraid someone I care about will find something out about my past or that someone from my past will show up and try to ruin my “new reputation “ that I have worked so hard for.

94,"I keep pondering over my experiences. For instance, I went on a date with my crush a few weeks ago. We planned to hook up &amp; do all that. He &amp; I were both virgins &amp; he even bought condoms the morning of our date.

We had a wonderful &amp; really nice date. Then we drove around, parked somewhere private, and things started heating up. We legit did everything but sex. He put on his condom and when he tried to put it in me, he kept failing. Like...he kept missing the ‘entrance’ and I eventually got dry? And it would’ve hurt if he put it in dry so I guess we kinda gave up in the moment and continued to do everything else.

Looking back at it, did he deserve to take my virginity? I can’t get over the fact that he literally could’ve taken it on the spot but never did. It makes me soooo frustrated. The guy and I don’t talk anymore (due to some reasons) and I feel regretful that I didn’t make the situation happen. 

But maybe it was for the best? Idk. Why didn’t it just happen? Maybe I’m rushing it.

TLDR; guy I liked and I planned on losing our virginities to each other. When the time came, he kept failing to put it in me and we gave up in the moment. I regret not trying again because I really wanted to lose my V-cars to him.",29Nov2019,1
95,"I was in my first relationship for 9 months and was happy. She had become  my best friend and we had this amazing connection.

A few weeks ago, I was at a party and got asked to make out by a guy, and I did it. I had wanted to do that in the past and it caught me completely off guard. (She had been my first kiss too.)

I told her, apologized and felt completely awful for what I did. It was really difficult for me to deal with the anxiety and regret over the next few weeks, even when she was willing to give me another chance. To make it worse, I misled her about the entire truth of what happened until later on.

Our connection was still there, even though she was angry with me. She made it clear that it would take a long time before she could trust me again. I began to have doubts about if I'd be emotionally able to deal with the process of winning her back, and knowing that would always be hanging over the relationship.

Here's the big plot twist. I had speculated about my mental health for a while, however when I woke up in Sunday, I knew I was experiencing hypomania, as I do on occasion. I also experience what I now see as depression, but hadn't been for a few months. My mood was elevated and confidence increased, my thoughts were racing, and I was mostly distracted from the situation.

I had already planned to talk to her that day, and when she came over I found myself rambling on and essentially just wanting to get out of that difficult situation. When it became clear I couldn't commit to trying again, she left angrily. She said that she had loved me, but now I could go fuck myself.

I freaked out initially, but I remained in this state for about 4 days, and just accepted that it was over. I texted her 2 days later and tried to explain myself, but not intending to win her back. This wasn't a good idea at all, and she basically said not to contact her again.

It seems to be beyond saving at this point. I feel like I had gotten lucky and could have been happy with her, but I completely fucked it up. I know people make mistakes in their first relationship, but this feels like it was a 1 in a million connection.

I'm a very quiet person and I had never really been happy single, and recently have been pretty unhappy with life (moving and changing jobs soon though).

How the hell do I move on from here, and deal with my regret? And how do I keep myself from begging her to take me back?",29Nov2019,1

Thankfully, I'll hopefully get to see her again soon because she is also part of an event (she's an usher) that I am exhibiting at.

104,"First of all let me say that i am not a health professional and that I only speak from personal experience.

I have been battling anxiety my whole life. Looking back I was an anxious child,  an anxious teenager and an anxious young person. I just didn't know that the way I felt was not the same way as other people feel.

I was finally diagnosed in my early 30s after a really bad episode, but not placed on medication. Every single day since then has been a struggle. I won't go into how I felt, because anxiety is a very personal experience, and even though most of us share symptoms, other symptoms are quite individual.

I considered going on medication several times a year since then, but would always talk myself out of it. I put my pride ahead of my needs and thought that people would think less of me. I thought that they would think me weak and that it would dull my personality.

This year it all finally came to a head ( aged 43) and i couldn't live another day feeling that way. My doctor placed me on Sertraline and my life has changed dramatically.

The first few weeks were tough. It takes a while for your body to adjust, but let me tell you, I got my life back.

I am going out, making friends, laughing and finally enjoying a life with living. There is no constant panic, no bouts of depression and no panic attacks.

If I can only give you one piece of advice is: don't rule out medication. Specially if the only thing holding you back is fear or pride. Nobody thinks badly of you if you have high blood pressure and you take a tablet to control it. Likewise, nobody will think less of you for taking one tablet to rebalance the chemicals in your brain.

Please don't suffer like I did, every day for years. I can't promise that meds will be the solution to every case, but don't be afraid either. Seek help and try the treatments. 

For me it worked.

Wishing you all a happy and healthy life full of joy and people that love you.",29Nov2019,1

I volunteer at a charity shop where they have heaters installed in the ceiling. 

I usually feel cold and I do wear layers and a jumper, despite this I am still cold. 

I prefer not to wear my winter coat whilst at the till because it would look absurd and because I am walking around and sorting stuff out I would feel stuffy and hot. 

Today all 3 managers were there and the door was open. They had the heaters on but because of leaving the door open, it’s a waste of electricity. 

I was about to close the door when one of the managers said to leave the door open because they notice a dip when the doors close. 

I understand why they would think so, but it’s completely stupid to leave the door open at this time of the year whilst the heaters are on! 

I have to work at the till and they did offer me a cardigan and other stuff to wear but the truth is I would still feel cold.

We don't know exactly what caused it, but she went to the vet today, after I pushed and pushed for my dad to take her. She thankfully tested negative for leukemia and other systemic issues, but they suspect it is a malignant tumor and they will likely have to amputate her leg because the affected tissue is too much to simply cut out. They gave her steroids and antibiotics and sent her home until the surgery is scheduled.

She is a sweet cat, and I'm heartbroken. I'm grateful that she does not have leukemia, because I know that's essentially a death sentence, but I'm still scared and wish I could have her here with me.
