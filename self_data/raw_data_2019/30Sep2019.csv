0,"I don’t understand how such a horrible stigma can be so deeply running in society. I understand that essentially the more attractive a woman is, the more men are likely to want to reproduce with them, and thus pass on their dna to a future generation. 

However what I don’t understand is why that turned into a whole industry of women needing to wear makeup, have long lashes, have big tits and a good ass, have full lips, shiny hair, long hair-free legs and a small waist... the list goes on and on... 

There is an endless list that women need to tick off in order for women to feel attractive to society, however, men do not have as extensive a list and although I do understand that there are stigmas for men, in terms of having to change themselves to be more attractive in the eyes of society, I really don’t believe that they have to go through as scrutiny as women.

I feel like it’s acceptable for men to have a bit of a tummy, because the clothes that they wear are able to hide it. Men don’t need to wear makeup, and they don’t need to care too much about their choice of clothing because they can still be considered attractive wearing a casual tee and baggy jeans (as opposed to women, who I feel get pressured to look “sexy” by wearing tight and/or cropped clothing). 

These are just thoughts and I probably haven’t explained myself amazingly, but I am just frustrated because I feel hopeless that society will never change these ideals of beauty and that it will forever be an uphill battle",30Sep2019,1

(M 19)

I have been deppressed for years because of PTSD's and I stopped drinking wich Made it worse. I went to a mental Hospital when I wanted to kill myself it. At this Point I still have rights. I can leave for 5 hours a day and Sometimes I get to stay the night somwhere else. Know I barely feel emotional anymore Sometimes pain but no more. So I got my shoelace and wanted to hang myself. Someone saw me and called a nurse. I am on a closed station now and barely have rights. The reason I wanted to kill myself was that the mental station was exausting. In the sense that the people where pulling me down. Yes I need therapy but I also need an different environment. So why am I writing this? Well idk tbh I am at the bottom. I am scared and afraid and feel like the doctors might think I should stay here. And I am sad that I have no say in that. 

Listen the position in which I am is shit. Do you have any thoughts? Anything please....

5,"As we all were told at the tutorial seminar we attended at birth, life can be really shitty. Sometimes, I'm just at a loss as to what to do about things, and I wanna talk about it. But I'm a guy, born and raised in sports and ""be a tough man"" ideals, and talking about my own personal baggage is hard. So even though I'm definitely trying to overcome that ham sammich of hypermasculine bologna, I still actively prevent myself from opening up to co-workers, or housemates, or friends, or anyone I know well.

So I thought, ""what about some baby steps and ask an acquaintance to be my coffee date buddy?"" So I was curious if any of y'all have had an experience like this. Is this a common enough relationship in the world? Is it always in person, or have you had a friend online that scratched this itch? Did you like it?

6,"So...  I work for a couple, and my boss is pregnant, and I've thought she was for about a week, but didn't want to ask in case she wasn't.  So I asked my coworker today if she was and she said she was pregnant... and then I found out later that my coworker has known for two weeks.  

Well, I feel really close to my bosses, I honestly just really love them both, and their daughter. Is it bad that I have my feelings hurt because they didn't tell me and because I found out through Angela, my coworker, who has only been here for two months?  

I do a lot for my bosses.  I work hard, shop for them, there to talk about their problems, etc.  I feel very close to them.  I stuck with this job because I like them so much, and because if I had quit it within the past year it would have been really hard for them...

I know I'm not there family or whatever, but I consider them friends.  The man in the couple said he'd figured I already knew.... but I don't know, I'd rather hear it from them instead of my co-worker.

They have the same level of struggle or more, somehow get higher grades than me, have a good personality while I am apparently the asshole or rude, overcome their obstacles and I am stuck resenting everyone and crying almost everyday, having a fragile ego.

9,"Earlier this year, I was recovering from a surgery that required removing one of my adrenal glands. I had a large mass that had hemorrhaged, and the surgery recovery was grueling. Less than a month into my recovery, I wasn’t mentally right and I had never felt so out of sorts in my life. My doctors assured me it must’ve been my hormones trying to re-adjust, but over time, things only got worse.

By the second month into my recovery, I returned to work as a surgical tech in veterinary medicine, and realized that I had lost 40lbs. Since I needed to work to pay off my medical debt, I tried to hide my new symptoms and brush them off as ‘no big deal’. I was no longer able to sleep more than 2 hours at night, and I became highly sensitive to the sound of lights buzzing to the point it drove me insane. I developed severe paranoia that I was being watched which is something I had never worried about before. 

During this time, I had found a new unusual obsession with building Raspberry Pi systems and other things that had never intrigued me before. I would spend hours dissecting and putting back together phones, computers, etc. for literally no reason. I spent 20 hours a day on my time off obsessively researching random topics. I began hallucinating at work and tried to hide it, until one day I asked my co-worker why there was a sphinx cat running loose in the hospital. She pulled me aside and told me I needed to see my doctor again and that people were noticing things that were ‘off’ about me lately. However, my doctors were well aware and couldn’t understand what went wrong with me after my surgery. One of the veterinary specialists at my job reviewed my lab work and said, “This isn’t post-surgery related at all. Your doctors are focusing in all the wrong places. You need to tell them to order an MRI...I think you have a bigger problem here.” 

I didn’t want to have a brain tumor, but I also wanted an answer to explain the madness I was experiencing. I had worried I was becoming schizophrenic and would never go back to normal ever again. I was only 25 years old and lived a normal life up until December 2018 when I had my left adrenal gland removed. It’s now been 6 months since my MRI results confirmed I had a brain tumor, and I am able to manage it with treatment in hopes I can shrink it or get rid of it without surgery.",30Sep2019,2

He says he’s an HIV researcher from Paris and moving into my city (Seattle) to be a caretaker for a CEO of a large company. He also has talked a lot about his dog and how important he is to him.

The older one and I have always had a strong bond. When we lived in different cities, we both would hug each other and cry for hours when we had to go home!

And delete my account immediately.

I'm gonna throw away/recycle my scale tomorrow. Idk yet. Prob just bring it to the recycling center down the road. So that's alright. I could sell it at the yard sale but my dad would prob be like wtf??? And yeah.. not risking any questions, concerns, etc.

everyone wants to correct others or remind them when they go wrong, that reminding earns them points
those points adds in your wisdom points as seen by society.
 but if you get proved wrong you loose points as well, two for one earned.
this can cause the points to go in negative as well.
THATS HOW THE WORLD IS WORKING

as a beginner, you have to avoid players with high points, just avoid, cause they can get under your skin and left you vulnerable.

36,"My parents are definitely not bad people. They worked very hard, taught me some great values and raised me better than most people. I'm lucky to have parents like them because I could have had much worse parents than them.

But I can't shake off this feeling of being super distant from them and I will never ever talk to them about my problems. It just feels like they've never really listened to me at all or even tried. I'm not sure if it's just me though because my younger brother has no problem talking to them about anything. He's gotten some preferential treatment growing up but that doesn't really bother me. He's in a good place in life now and I'm just happy about that.

My father is very short-tempered and aggressive. My mother is more patient but she doesn't really have her own opinions and follows what my father says. Both of them are not great listeners. Everytime I feel the urge to tell them something or discuss a problem I'm having every single time it's just ended up with blaming me (you shouldn't have done that, it's your fault, etc) or just plain aggression as a response.

There have been days where I don't want to call them or speak to them at all. When we meet for a family dinner or something, I'm just really quiet most of the time and I don't say anything. Then they say ""oh you're so quiet"".

They just had very high expectations from me to do things and when I inevitably failed at most of them, they would never try to listen to me as to why I failed and what I'm struggling with. It's always just ""you shouldn't have done that"" and if it's heated enough, ""you're a disappointment"".

Now I don't want to share anything that's going on about my life with them. It really irks me to even try because the end result has always been the same so I'm not even going to try.

But I know I'm still luckier than many. There was no physical abuse, they still paid for my education and housed me and they are still patient with me for trying to get back up on my feet. It's just that I grew up feeling misunderstood and like an outcast until I met some friends who allowed me to be myself.

   As the title says, I'm worried that I'll loose my friend at some point of my life. We have become really good friends over the past few months, and we consider each other best friends at this point. I understand that most of the time worrying is pointless, but I think given my situation I have a good reason to be. I'll explain why my friend is so important and give you some other background info.

   Without going into much detail about it, you could say I've been hit hard with problems in the last couple years. Basically, my future plans/dreams have changed drastically due to injuries, and it took a major toll on my everyday life (school, relationships, hobbies, ect). There was a period of time for about 4 months where I would wake up, go to school, and come home just to lie down on my bed for 5 hours, and then sleep and repeat the same thing the next day. I would get home feeling like even though I had done nothing all day, I had no energy for chores or homework. Nobody seemed to understand what I was dealing with. Nobody seemed to care (aside from my parents).

   My issues peaked in December. This is when it hit me that the life I had planned was no longer livable due to health concerns. In general I found myself wishing I could be the person I was before my injuries. I found myself with so many empty friendships, even with people I had known forever. I was never happy. However, I eventually felt comfortable going to parties again. That's when I decided to start drinking a lot. When I had no parties to go to I'd drink by myself.  As stupid as it is, I get drawn to drinking when I'm sad. Foreshadowing on my actions during that time I've realized it was horrible for my mental health.  I continued like this until I met my friend in February

   While it started with casual conversations at school, I started to discover I genuinely enjoy talking to this person. We'd have a nice conversation about future plans, sports, or whatever  we felt like that day (we still do now). I had finally found a friend that is not only extremely positive to be around, but one that also genuinely cared about my well being and our friendship in general. This has been proven true so many times as our friendship has grown.

   Fast forward to the present, I have only drank once in the past 5 months. The time I did drink it was in moderation and we discussed it beforehand just so I knew they'd be ok with it. I have a reason to wake up happy every single day cause I know I have a friend that cares. Not only that but I also have a reason to try my best to be a good influence, and teach based on my previous experience. In my efforts to be a good role model  I've been able to help them with a lot. I'm finally getting over issues related to my injuries and I feel closer to doing activities I couldn't for a while because of them.

   Realizing all they've done, my life isn't the same if I didn't meet them. I don't know if I'd even be here at this point. I feel like losing them would be the proving point that anything positive in my life will never last and I'll be stuck in the same spot forever. If I bring my fears up, I know it will upset them, so I had nowhere else to go. thanks for any help/advice in advance.",30Sep2019,1

Went to the orthopedic doctor and he said it might be another 3-4 weeks before it’s close to being normal and months after before I’m back to hiking.

I am usually an active person with many hobbies such as hiking, biking, working on cars, and rc car racing. Being on the couch and using crutches to walk is starting to make me feel a little down. Doctor told me I can start putting weight on it with a walking boot but with crutches it’s almost near impossible to carry anything or do anything I’m used to. Friends don’t come by and my girlfriend is at work all day. I’m waiting for payment by my workers compensation and I’m using my savings that I was super close to buying a brand new car with and it’s pretty depressing seeing my savings account going down that I worked so hard on. Can’t go back to work for another month. How would you cope? I’m trying to be positive but healing seems to be taking forever which is natural for ligaments considering they don’t heal fast.

**TL;DR** Injured myself at work and feeling a little down that I can’t do the things I used to.",30Sep2019,1
48,"So, I've recently graduated University. Now I'm going for my Master's. At the time of me writing this it's about 2 in the morning. So I've just been doing my homework for my class in the morning until my friend sent me a video. We send each other memes and stuff all the time, but this one was different. It hit me hard, harder than he'll ever realize. It's a TikTok, but this one is a little more...I dunno it feels more real and not as a joke. It goes like this:

&amp;#x200B;

Some sad guitar music is playing, along with the captions 

""on the night of graduation you'll come home and take a seat alone, and think about everything that has happened in the last 4 years, all the people, memories, nights with the boys, 

**but what's next**?""

That last line, or rather the entirety just hit me. I've never really reflected back on it until now. Even on the last day, I never thought about it. Most of my friends are one grade above me, so when they left, they left. Some stayed for their Master's which mixed well with my Senior year. But now they've completely graduated that as well. It's to the point where I'm commuting, not just to save money, but because.. there wasn't a point in living on campus anymore. Let me get to the point.

I don't know what's next. I don't care for going to college anymore, but I was so accustomed to education, I never really expected to just end it. It feels, bland. And it's not even just that, looking back at the 4 years I was living on campus, man, I messed up. My grades were fine, but socially, I was not into it. I was an introvert, and though I appreciate my friends at the time for helping me get out of it (mostly) I still can look back and feel regrets for ""not acting upon this"" and the like.

I'm honestly scared. It's not like the TV show FRIENDS where they've all been friends well into their 30s or anything. out of the 9 or so friends I had, only about 2 I can call true friends. and even then, it's getting more and more difficult to meetup.  I don't know what's going to happen, because I haven't planned anything yet. And I'm running out of time. The second I'm done with my Master's I'm supposed to go off and find a job, but I don't even know where t start. and that's just.. i dunno. scary to me",30Sep2019,1

I am only 23 and have spent so much time being miserable that the notion that I may die earlier than expected is terrifying and making me sad for not appreciating my life. 

The nerves from waiting for the results are killing me. If all is well I do want to practice just appreciating life. If it’s not , well I wanna appreciate the time I have. I don’t mean to sound so fatalistic. I’m just nervous as shit.",30Sep2019,2
50,"As someone who has been battling with depression since they were eight. It’s been a tough ass journey to live through. Just recently I’ve been reverting back to my extreme depressed phase, I haven’t been like this since last year of May/June, recently I’ve been becoming more hopeless and just extremely broken inside for no reason. I’ve been pushing everyone I know away and I’ve been pushing my parents away too which isn’t good at all. I don’t want to push my boyfriend away either I know his heart is in the right place but at the same time it’s like “do I really want to do this to him..? Do I really want him to listen to me ramble about how depressed and suicidal I am when he has his own issues?.” I just don’t know what to do anymore. I see a therapist and take medications but I just don’t feel like nothing is helping anymore. I feel like my like has no meaning to it and it never has. I feel like I myself as a person has no meaning not even to me I believe I have no meaning besides to make people miserable and angry at me all the time. I feel hopeless and I feel stuck the urges to hurt myself and commit suicide get stronger each day but I have no idea why. The urge to tear out my own throat so I can choke on my own blood gets stronger everyday too. I don’t know what I can do and I don’t know what to do. I just really hate myself and I can’t do it anymore",30Sep2019,2
51,"Didn't know anywhere else to put this, all the confession subreddits say no illegal stuff &amp; this is probs bordering on illegal, so eh. I just need to get this off my chest.

So i'm an extreme masochist, to the point where any pain is good pain to me. Get slapped in the face? Yep, I like that. Stub my toe? Uh-huh. Biting my tongue by accident? Sure feels weird but I like it. It's a bit of a curse and a blessing at the same time in all honesty, I don't worry about getting hurt when doing something but at the same time if I do I'll have a hard time knowing when it's too much. But that's besides the point.
Something that really sticks in my mind and makes me blush is the thought of dying. I'm not suicidal, at least not in the depression way, though I do struggle with depression too. I've always thought, what'd be the hottest way, in my opinion to die. And I have that. Now, I could always just do it myself, but I think it'd be way better to do it with somebody else. It just feels like it'd be alot more intimate to do it that way. Now, if you don't like detail, please stop reading, but if you're ok, or morbidly curious, with it, do go on.
I want to livestream myself somehow, not sure what it'd be on, but probably some obscure website, or some place that would accept it. I'd want it to be put on bestgore or liveleak for archive purposes, maybe people could watch it for ""educational purposes"" or whatever, I don't really care, I'd just want it online. I'd give my note or whatever, and then disembowel myself and eat whatever I get out. Hopefully by then, after tasting myself and covering my face in my blood I'd die, though if I survive the ordeal I'd probably do it again, or stick around for a while, I'm not sure. I'm gonna die early though. 
Now, it'll be alot better with somebody else because not only would they be able to stop the livestream once it's all over, but they'd be able to finish the cutting if I for some reason stopped. And, yes, I know many people regret it while killing themselves, that's why I'd hope for the other to force me or calm me in that moment. It'd be cute. 
Though, if I am alone, it'd be sad, but I'd still enjoy doing it. Maybe I'd become a ghost? Unfinished business and all. [If you don't believe in ghosts, I respect that.]

I like knowing I'll die like this, it's like romeo &amp; juliet, that anticipation. Especially because I know that I don't wanna get to an old age. I'll die before I'm 30 hopefully, which isn't that far away, &amp; that makes me happy. Everytime I realise how close I am, how close I'm getting, I get excited, it puts me in a good mood.

It'd be fun to take somebody with me, but I don't wanna be known as some kind of monster, if anybody finds the video. Am I hoping to get popular because of the video? No. If I was, I'd fake it, why would I try to get popular when I'm not around to see the popularity? Doesn't make sense to me. 

All I hope for when I die is to have fun doing it, and for a video of it to be up for people to see, uncensored, and easily findable. If it's censored, banned from the internet, maybe some deep web people will put it on a website there. My main wish will have been shattered, but hey, at least somebody saw it haha. 

If anybody's concerned or worried about me, don't be, everybody dies, I'm just gonna do it in a way that's satisfying for me. Just as many people wish to die in a painless way in their sleep, I have my own wishes for my death. I'm over halfway there, exciting~

I might delete this post tomorrow, it's 1AM and I'm at a weird headspace, but I don't like bottling up thoughts for this long, it's been a year. I needed to get this out there. Anyways, hope you have a good day, night, evening, whatever

56,"I've been alive for 23 years old now, and I've never had this feeling before.

Way back in school, many students used to bully me, it wasn't too much but when Ibstarted getting annoyed by it, they kept doing it more often, I hated them and hated school for this.

After finishing school I was so happy that I wouldn't have to deal with them again,

I had really good marks, I could join any public University, and get free education,

I really wanted to join Computer Science but my dad refused, and I was a really introverted kid I didn't even have courage to stand in his face and tell him what I really want,

He yelled at me many times and I couldn't take it, so I just did what he wanted and joined the Faculty of Engineering,

First year was one of the best years of my life socially, I barely passed academically though,

I failed 2nd year and couldn't change Faculties to Computer Science, I kept trying different workarounds to transfer, but it just didn't work out,

Now after 3 years in this place ( Faculty of Engineering ) we had to put in preferences for what branch we could join, I though Computer Engineering was the closest to what I wanted so I wrote it as a first preference and guess what?

Everybody wanted it so they took in the people with the highest marks in the year prior, I didn't do well that year so my marks weren't good enough.

Now I feel like I'm not an actual human being, I'm so irresponsible and I keep blaming my parents for forcing me somewhere I didn't want, but fact is just that I was weak.

Now I have started my 5th academical year, if I pass this year and the next one I'll just get a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Power and Machines Engineering, and then I can do whatever I want,
I'm trying to study some Computer Science courses on the side, but the time is tight with the University schedule.

I hope that I could've stood to my parents' face and told them what I really wanted back then, now even they regret forcing me into this place since they've seen me grow like an irresponsible sub-human being.

I live in Egypt, and I'm 23 years old now, I don't have a job, and my parents are still giving me pocket money.

I'm starting to feel hopeless in fixing myself into a real responsible human being, what does it take? Is it possible to get fixed at my age? Will I ever succeed?",30Sep2019,6
57,"For the first time in years, a violent bout of self-loathing held my conscious hostage. It lasted for an hour or two. I rocked back and forth on my bed, listening to my own mind feed me lies about myself.  Nothing specific, nothing it could prove.. just vague, yet convincing, implications of worthlessness and insufficiency.

At some point amidst the noise, some shred of sanity burst through and reminded me that I hadn't taken a real breath in awhile. So I did. And I continued to do so. Deliberately. Slowly. Until the noise went away. It's so quiet now that I can hear the silence of the early morning hours outside of my head. I didn't even know I couldn't hear it.

I might be in the clear for a day, a week, or perhaps a decade. I don't get to choose when it will come back. But hopefully next time I'll remember to breathe.",30Sep2019,3
58,"Back then I used to be happy, with something to say Everytime, energetic and could say even charismatic for calling it in some way, now I'm just here, existing without will, with nothing to say or even not knowing how to interact with people anymore. I came from making everyone laugh in a room so naturally that I didn't even realized how natural it was, as I couldn't understand, for example, ""bored"" or shy people because 'it's so easy dude, just say some random shit and everyone will laugh lol'. Nowadays I find myself awkward and socially uncomfortable all the time around people, can't make them laugh nor feel related to me. I feel like I'm thinking slower than anytime before, I use to forgot words, not know how to express myself, forget ideas, can't express emotions ,etc, I feel like I'm dumber every day.

I don't know why this happened, but as long as I remember it started like a year ago, when got with my ex and isolate myself with her and a friend I used to talk often who almost became my only close friend. I started realizing this since we broke and was completely alone and unable to socialize as easy as I could before, even though I only realized that I'm being ""more stupid"" a few weeks ago.

61,"To start I'm 16 and in high school
My parents got divorced when I was about 13 or 14 and I stayed with my mom. I shunned my dad and went to see him only on every weekends and sometimes wouldn't even go. 

We moved house and I still stayed with my mom. She got involved with a weird crowd and I ended up staying my my dad about a year later. I think she started drugs and was with a younger guy who didnt treat her well. I treated her like shit and it makes me sad thinking about it. 
After moving in with my dad I shunned her and ignored her calls, didnt see her on weekends and treated her like shit too. I expected her to give me gifts and whatever even though there was no relationship. My excuse was that I'm not the bad guy and she's the one who is involved with bad people. But I was the shitty one. She tried with me and I rejected her and treated her badly after she had cared for me all my life and we had a decent relationship before the divorce. We were close. Then in about Jan she passed away. She killed herself. 
I didnt know what to feel and havent dealt with it properly or talked about it to anyone really. I just try to ignore the emotions and suppress them and I think I shouldn't feel sad. 
I have a few friends at school but during holidays dont leave my room cos I dont get invited to anything and when I do I for some reason I dont go.

The buildings we live in aren't natural, nor the materials, scaffolding, cranes, trucks and other vehicles, nor the roads they drive on. The social structures that allow a group of unrelated people to come together to make those buildings, in order to receive pieces of paper with no inherent value, which they can use to exchange for things or services, isn't natural. The whole concept of the ""value"" of things, whether money, gold, goods or services, isn't natural, because those are all arbitrary decisions agreed upon by people.

78,"I’ve had a real hard time with dating, I guess I’m picky, and at this point in my life I’ve come to accept that my personality is not everyone’s cup of tea - I find that people either really hate me or think I’m fantastic, but as for the latter I’m almost always an acquired taste, which is something I’m okay with. 

My job has also made dating difficult. I work in politics, and I took a job in another country to work on an election. After the election, the party I worked for came to some degree of power and I got a permanent job with them, I didn’t realise how much young people hate this party until recently, not even just in this country but also at home! When I tell people my age that I work for this party they are often angry with me, which is certainly an obstacle. 

I had started to think something was wrong with me, because I was finding it exceedingly difficult to have feelings for a woman. Sometimes I’d meet a girl who liked me, she’d be cool and everything, nothing wrong with her, but I just could not will myself to have any sort of strong feelings with her. However, a couple weeks ago my cousin (much older than myself) had a party, and her friend brought her sister, who is my age. I was smitten with her almost immediately after introducing myself and we really hit it off. I couldn’t believe how easily conversation flowed with her and how much we seemed to have in common. 

She saw that my work jacket had the badge of the party I work for on the shoulder, and she says “That’s a cool jacket, do you actually support [party]?” I reply that I work for them, anticipating a negative reaction, but instead she asked me to explain why I support the party and what it’s like to work for them, saying that she really admired that I would move countries to help the party with their election and that I obviously did a good job given the results. I’ve never heard a person my age react that way to hearing about my job and it was really nice. 

Since the party, we’ve been texting every day and I get butterflies when she messages me. I don’t think I’ve had that since I was maybe 15. I finally asked her on a date and she said yes, so we’re planning that now.

I (30 F) am currently in a stable career, in a health care job that I’ve had for over 7 years. Able to save a little money and comfortably pay my bills. I know I am good at my job by the feedback I get from my patients. I have compassion for them and I’m fairly competent in my skills. 
The problem is that I have so much stress from my job that I have developed some health issues related to it. I have almost constant anxiety- but only when it comes to my job. The job itself is not the worst, but I think part of the stress comes from the fact that it is not what I want to be doing with my life (other stressors come from rude coworkers, doctors, and occasionally downright mean patients). The problem is, I don’t really know what I want to do with my life. So I’ve stuck with this stable job in the meantime. Doesn’t seem like the worst idea- except the anxiety has grown, ever so slowly, over time from working and doing something that stresses me out that I don’t really want to be doing but have to do because I don’t know what else to do with my life. As the anxiety grows, it gets stronger, and is leeching into other areas of my life- like my marriage- and causing problems there. 

So what am I to do?

Stay in a financially stable situation and continue to hope one day I wake up and know my purpose or calling or whatever and then pursue it? All the while my anxiety continues to lurk in the background and suck away my happiness?

Or..

Fuck it? Throw away stability and try something- anything- new? Problem here is, almost nothing new I try will be a skilled or well-paid position. I will put my spouse and I in a (major) financial strain. And for what? A potentially equally stressful job but with less money to show for it? 

How do you do this guys? How do you take that leap into the unknown? I could see doing it for something I really had a passion for; something I always wanted to do. Because if you fail while chasing your dreams, at least it was for a good cause. 

But me? I have no dreams. Unless you consider living free from anxiety a dream. What if I can’t outrun it anyway? What if I lose everything?

On the other hand, what if I do nothing. Stay where I’m at and slowly exchange my soul for bits of money here and there. Then wake up one day, old enough to retire but empty and completely spent, with no life left in me to live the last of my days with? Wondering how different my life would have been if I had had the courage to let go and fail? 

Have been struggling with this for years. Probably need a therapist but thanks for the space to let it out and rant. 

Will appreciate any thoughts or hugs.",30Sep2019,3

90,"Sorry about the pretentious title. I really didn't mean it to be but I didn't know what else to put there. Here's the thing: I never really put in an effort to make friends, and even so, I never really seem to have a problem making friends. This is something I both take pride in and am ashamed of at the same time. Usually, when I'm travelling, moving, starting a new job, or whatever, it doesn't take long before I've got people around me who I would call friends. However, I can't think of a single time when I've been the person to reach out. I'm never the person to introduce myself unprompted. Yet somehow I never really end up alone. From this I've drawn a couple of conclusions:

Firstly, people, for some reason, are drawn to me and/or like me, generally. Not all people (not at all), but some people. Those people also often stay for ""round two"". That is, most people who do approach me tend to like me enough to stick around and become actual friends with me. 

Second, I'm a scared little wuss and am bad at initiating friendships and/or social interactions. (I'll cut myself some slack here; I'm totally fine as long as I approach someone without the intent of befriending them, like asking for directions or having a leisurely chat about the weather). But in general, I tend to shy away from people.

This leads to questions: Why are (a certain group of) people drawn to me? What do they have in common? Since I do not put in the effort they do, am I really deserving of their friendship? What will happen to me once all my current friends are too preoccupied with their own lives to have time for me, and people no longer seem attracted to me? Speaking of attraction, why do I seem so succesful in making friends but show zero progress in the romance area? Is it because of the very fact that I don't take initiatives? How is forming a romantic relationship different than that between friends? Why can I become friends with someone, then drift apart for a bit and settle on an ""acquainted"" level, but when I start up a romantic relationship with someone, it appears to be more ""all or nothing""?

Back on topic, I'm thankful to have once again, after moving to a completely new place, seemed to have been adopted into not one, but two groups, and have made a couple of single friends as well. This time, I very much intended to put in an effort but I literally didn't even get a chance too. I knew one person who used to live here, and he made sure someone met with me once I got here. The rest are just branches from that one meeting. I genuinely don't understand how this can be.",30Sep2019,1

So I’ve started a part-time job while I finish things for my nursing aid license and the employer/owner finds faults in all aspects of the work that I do. It’s a job at a tiny donut shop that I don’t intend to put on my resume, but is necessary for me to have for an additional income temporarily. She’s always putting me down for all the mistakes I make and has started to not believe that I have management experience because she doesn’t think I’m ever doing thing right or to her expectations. Small mistakes always, but she’ll correct me in the nastiest ways and in front of customers making me look like a fool. She’s very controlling, it is her business after all, but sometimes she doesn’t let me have a second to fix my mistakes before she’ll barge in correct it and then lecture me on how incompetent I am at the task. I studied marketing before this and after leaving my corporate career because I hated what I was doing I began the switch to nursing. I’m eager to begin with that, but the little customer service job I’m doing on the side is now crushing me mentally because despite as simple as it is, she doesn’t see anything that I do ever done the right way. I’ve been patient and wanted to lash out  but her a Middle Aged Korean woman, reminds me heavily of my own grandmother who’s Filipino and controlling as fuck.. still, no way to train anyone for success, but I’m 26 and she makes me feel pathetic cause all her younger employees seem to get it but I apparently can’t do things as simple as sweeping the correct way.",30Sep2019,2
94,"Sometimes I have deep conversations with myself about the concept of life. Sometimes it frustrates me because I feel like I’m not meant to be here. I don’t want to live this mediocre life working at a company, making another persons dream come to life just so I can survive to be here on this planet. I don’t want to find love with someone who will probably just leave me for someone better when he gets tired of putting up with me because I believe it’s unnatural to just stay with one person for the rest of our lives. I don’t want to have children who I have to bring into this world and try my best to make sure they don’t get fucked by society or by my bad behaviors. Other than a career, love and children, what else is there to life? 

So that’s why I don’t see the reason to live. But the thought of death scares me. I don’t want to cause any pain for myself or for others around me. I’m scared if I do try to kill myself, there might be a chance I’ll live and be brain dead for the rest of my life. I’m scared that my friends and family will never recover from my death. I’m scared of feeling those few minutes of pain before I leave this earth. 

That’s why sometimes, I’ll do off the wall things to try to get a taste of death. I’ll go on walks by myself in the middle of the night in the middle of the hood in hopes someone will murder me. I’ll go swimming deep in the ocean at night in hopes that a shark will eat me alive. I’ll drive recklessly on the freeway in hopes that my car swerves off and hits a tree. I do drugs in hopes that it’s a bad batch and I slowly fall asleep to my death.

I've had a pretty wild life so far for someone of my age. I live in a medium city with a healthy relationship with most of my family and a great job.  


In short, I've planned the next years of my life, in a different way then others.  
I have slowly worked to isolate myself from external forces. I plan to slip out and disappear forever.  
I'm not leaving a wife or a family behind. I just am not eager to live this life I was born into.

Life is very meaningless - I'd love to have a child but the thought of raising someone in this fucked up world keeps me from it.  
I see what's destroying the world and the enjoyment of people in that world, how many people live life watching the ""image"" of others through false lenses.

I've spent years writing code to automate my social media platforms, and I have had friends agree to manage my finances and do the human logins\\platform changes.  


I've got about 10 years planned, 10 years of a fake life, before anyone will even notice that I'm no longer around.  


Where do I want to go, anywhere but this world - I've worked since I was 16, and every year, more time is expected and less money is offered.  


I wait and hope for change, I advocate change and do much in my day to day to impact the future of the new world.

97,"Sad to say that days away from my cake day I have began debating whether or not to delete my account and delete Reddit altogether. 

I have been lurking on Reddit for years, a buddy of mine told me about all the interesting subreddits and I was very much interested. I decided to make an account when I found some subs I wanted to get involved in and participate but that’s where it goes downhill. I began posting and commenting, having fun when the mods of subs began power trips. Locking replies, permanent bans for stupid comments and removing posts stating it’s against the rules but when questioned the reply is that it wasn’t removable due to rules, it lacks the wow factor. 

Fuck off with that garbage. I deleted Facebook years ago because everyone says, “look at me! like my content!!!” And Reddit is no different. There are humble subs that I’ve been involved in since I started perusing Reddit that are seriously awesome. But encountering a few bad eggs out of a dozen at the supermarket means you don’t buy the batch or swap out the bad for the good. You avoid that dozen all the same. 

Maybe lurking is all I should do, at least I would be a avoiding being able to participate it the shit show. But then again, my last activity was twentyish days ago and that whole time I never missed my favorite subs or any content from the rest. 

I have seen some posts in the past from Reddit users from the days of yore, the days Reddit was young and they all point the the devolvement and delusion that has become Reddit today. All stating that the main subs are akin to Facebook where likes and getting noticed is important and following sub rules is dictated by goobs with a thing for pissing on people. Maybe those Redditors of the past have a point in not being involved. Either way, that’s my rant. Thanks for the read.",30Sep2019,3

I find myself overly exhausted after work (I don't have a physically demanding job, I'm a graphic designer for a clothing production company who is often at my desk/in meetings) and inable to pursue hobbies/sports afterwards.

I also do not have a strong relationship with family, who have always never found anything myself or my siblings have done to be good enough, so I decided to remove myself from that situation.

101," 

I \[M/16\] (excuse my mistakes, i am not a native speaker) am going through quite a tough phase right now. I am not depressed at all and consider myself to be quite emotionally stable. But over the past few months i feel like i‘ve grown too much into overthinking and self doubt.

So it begins in september last year. There is this girl, who i kind of fell for. We had a joint group of friends but didn‘t know each other too well. But apparently she also had some feelings for me. At least her and my friends said so. So the situation was the following:

For the following 2 months the situation was quite weird because we both knew that we had feelings for each other BUT:

I didn‘t make any attempts because I wasn‘t getting any signals from her. It was just my and her friends telling me, that she is quite into me as well, which isn‘t the best basis for any further steps. I didn‘t get any signals from her and I am also quite shy in these things myself so I barely made any attempts and she did neither because she was really shy herself (eventhough we both are generally quite extroverted people). When I was celebrating my 16th birthday in november, she got a little drunk (we are from germany, it‘s legal here). Then she made first, very obvious attempts, which i didn‘t take, because 1st she was drunk and 2nd I was overwhelmed in that situation.

So there happened nothing between us that day. So days and weeks went by, until i found out, she wasn‘t that into me anymore. (We’re in december now).

Then I took my courage and talked to her about my feelings the first time. She told me she was sorry and she wished it would have come earlier but shes just not into me anymore. I accepted and since we were friends as well we tried to remain at friendship. This didn’t work too well for me, eventhough I never showed it. I talked to her quite a few more times about us and we remained friends but this thing always stood between us and eventhough my feelings for her vanished slowly, they never fully disappeared. So over the year my feelings vanished slowly but we both didnt talk too much, especially not about our situation. I found my feelings going up and down, sometimes I was thinking much about her, sometimes I felt like I was really over her.

About three weeks ago we went to a party of a friend and she seemed quite sad (she did occasionally on parties) and I talked to her first about her being sad but the conversation drifted of and somewhen we also talked about our difficulties in having a normal relationship for the first time. I told her that I had no feelings at all for her (I know not that a great idea) and we agreed to just let the past behind us. That may sound too simple but at first it worked and our relationship did normalize indeed (at least imo) and I thought at first my feelings really did vanish.

I think you all know which word comes next:

BUT,

last sunday we went on a class trip to Dublin so I would spend a whole week with her. We did have a lot of contact, talked a lot and one evening just the two of us spontaneously went through the streets of Dublin and had a nice talk for about half an hour or 45ish minutes. During this class trip my feelings came back very strongly, I guess but I wouldn´t dare to talk about it with anyone, just like I didn´t talk about it with anyone for the last year. I neither want to speak to my friends or her because I´m really insecure about this and I feel like 1st i´m giving up a part of how I see myself and how I want other people to see myself by showing hard feelings (eventhough I know thats quite dumb) and I don´t want to ruin our friendship and look to needy and desperate.

I think I can´t express my feelings properly in English because I couldn´t explain them even in German nor to myself. I´m kinda in a dilemma because what ever I do, it feels wrong. If I don´t talk to her, I will experience the feelings of sadness and self-doubt of last year again and I feel like giving up on me and embarassing myself by talking to anyone I know because they know the situatuion and all feel like its over for 9 months and I seem to be the only person to still think about it.

Not being able to talk about this is really frustrating for me and intensifies my self-doubts in every sense so eventhough I think I am quite self-confident, its always accompanied by self-doubt.

I feel like I need to talk to someone and if I won´t talk to someone I know, I´ve got to tell it to strangers on the internet and hope, no one I know browses r/self.",30Sep2019,3

108,"Im in a band with 2 of my friends, we play shows around our city 1-2 times a month and have almost a dozen original songs. The first few songs we wrote, we wrote together. One of us would have a riff or a chorus or a beat or some lyrics and we'd fuck around till it worked. Then we'd play it through tons of times and try different things and different forms and it was a lot of fun. 

However lately, it seems pretty one-sided. The guitar player comes in with all the lyrics, all the parts, how it should go and sound. And his songs... Are pretty damn good. Better than anything I think I could write. And theyre fun to play. But its no fun when I cant participate in making it. Its not *my* song. It feels like Im playing a cover. Im just getting taught how it should sound. I even had an idea for one song and when I proposed it, he went ""this song is kinda done... So..."" Which is pretty lame.

And Im torn. Part of me thinks, well, its his song. He wrote it. He should get final say. But the other part me is saying, but its *our* band. Im playing it too. Am I here as an equal member or as backup?

My return to a damn text message that does not take 6 hours to get? 

I know I should give him up, let him go...but how? When my heart wants to give him just one more chance. Just one more shot, because he can change. I know he will...so says my heart. But my brain? It knows it's time to end things and tell him that maybe our communication skills are just too mismatched for this to work. I'm going to miss him. My heart is already pre-broken.

120,"This is my first post and I’m on mobile so be aware of a huge wall of text. I am sorry. 


I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for a very long time. I’ve gone to therapists on and off throughout my life time but nothing ever stuck with me for various reasons but mainly just because it’s so incredibly hard for me to open up and express my emotions. When I finally opened up to a doctor about feeling depressed I was around 15 and they referred me to a therapist but my pediatrician didn’t like prescribing “children” with antidepressants or anything of that sort so now I can’t find the courage to talk to anyone about how I feel. 
Recently, I lost my health insurance due to my mother quitting her job so I feel like even if I wanted to reach out and get help it’ll be too hard and expensive. 
I feel like everyday is getting worse and depression consumes me. My boyfriend, who is so supportive of me is getting frustrated because I’m like a broken record at this point and every time anything happens I just find that I can’t open up and talk about it and I resort to anger which isn’t fair to any body. 

I just feel so hopeless and I’m tired of it. I’m just wondering if anyone has gone through this before and can give some ideas since my health insurance fell through.",30Sep2019,1
121,"hey guys. i had no idea where else to post this but i knew i needed to post it somewhere, i’m sorry if this is the wrong sub for this. anyways-

i’m 17. i don’t have a job. i’m dropping out of high school because depression and suicidal tendencies has put me so behind in school, there’s no way i can catch up in a timely manner. my ideal goal is to get my GED then go to either a trade school or a community college. to help me with all of this i joined this program that will assist me (general classes for GED test prep, college scholarships, career guidance, etc). but right now i’m in the process of waiting for things to happen. so atm, i have nothing to do with my life. i have very little friends, i don’t get to see them much (once every two months, max), i’ve been trapped in my house with nothing but myself and my dogs, and then my dad when he gets home from work. 

i’m going absolutely crazy. why is doing nothing making me so stressed? i feel like it should have the opposite effect. but no, of course not. my depression has gotten worse, and because i’m not in school right now and i haven’t actually officially dropped out yet, i have no insurance, so my depression is going untreated for the first time in three years. no medication or therapy. 

i’m in serious need of something helpful from anyone. whether that be ideas, advice, or just some kind of support? i don’t exactly know. all i know is that i need help.",30Sep2019,1
122,"4 years and the feelings have never faded. 
we could lose communication for months and once one of us reaches out and it feels as though, nothing has ever changed. 
I feel like complete shit because he has someone new now and it’s my fault for ever letting him get away. 
but he deserves to be happy right? 
it just doesn’t feel right to me, feels like we’re meant to be.",30Sep2019,4
123,"I haven't really talked to anyone, sure I've had my fair share of little convos or just some simple small talk, but I mean like a full on conversation, about anything.

&amp;#x200B;

And although I think I should feel bad about it, I actually don't, sure I kinda miss or rather want to talk with someone for more than just a minute sometimes, but I also feel like I've been improving in terms of my mental health. Maybe I've been putting to much pressure on myself to be well known in my class.

&amp;#x200B;

I also feel kinda lonely, I've noticed that lately my desire of wanting a S.O. is increasing, and I don't know whether or not it's just from me being horny or maybe I do actually want a closer relationship with someone, and do those cringey but also cute things.

&amp;#x200B;

Back to the not having a proper convo for a long time part, I like talking to people it's just that I find it hard to willingly open up to them, I feel like I subconsciously put up walls and don't let myself connect to people.

It also doesn't help that I can't talk as in full on speak in my room without my parents hearing what I say. That's a bloody nightmare, for instance I would like to talk to my buds about some ""boy"" related things and I can't help but think

*""My parents probably heard that.""* and that I should talk softer or quieter.

And god forbid I talk to a female, then it's just a fuckery.

*""Who is She?"" ""How do you know Her?"" ""Where does She live?"" ""Is She from your school?"" ""Do You like Her?"" ""Is She Your girlfriend""* Like dawg, I'm just trying to get notes from the class I skipped cause I was sick, chill the fuck out.

It's a shitty situation, especially so because my parents don't really know me too well, and have a warped view of my person. And I'm really kinda worried that if I do things ""not normal for Me"" they'll be upset or shocked.

&amp;#x200B;

Plus I, for the most part, have no clue what to talk about with people. Like *""Oh, we have some nice weather finally!""* or *""I don't like snapchat.""*

Ok, what the fuck am I supposed to say to that? *""Yeah, I guess we do.""* or *""Alright.""* People actually expect me to have a nice convo based on that?! Where the fuck do you go from there?

OHH and if I try to talk to someone they just give me this fucking weird ass look, like I just killed their cat or some shit. I know I don't talk much but fucking hell it's not that odd, at least act like it's normal whilst we're talking.

It's just infuriating.",30Sep2019,1

125,"By baby I mean my dog Kodi. He was 12. He lived a very long happy life. I got to hold his head and paws as he took his last breath. I loved him so much. I miss him so much. The vet emailed me today and said they have his ashes and we can come pick them up, and that kind of just broke me all over again.

126,"My parents were narcissistic and neglectful. My father was an alcoholic and my mother is mentally ill and particularly emotionally abusive. My first relationship was with an extremely emotional abusive person who I believe to be a predator. My second big relationship lasted for five years and while I deeply love him he’s not emotionally well and tends to take it out on me, being very cruel and demeaning. When I seen him now on occasion I get embarrassed sometimes of how he talks to me. My closest friendships have also been one sided including one very close friend who basically acted like I was her serve t and got jealous when I dated my last partner and tried to insist he was only using me for sex. 

I’m much much stronger now but it still feels like people around me can be very mean sometimes or just don’t make me a priority like I make them. I’m trying to set my boundaries and continue meeting new people but sometimes it feels hopeless. Like I can’t trust myself or that maybe healthy relationships don’t exist. I feel ashamed of continually seeming to find myself in bad positions. And when I read articles about how lack of self confidence attracts abusers I feel even worse. I want to be confident but it’s hard especially when I feel like there is literally no one in my life who really cares. And also it’s hard not to feel weak for continuing to spend time with people just because I don’t want to feel completely alone.",30Sep2019,1

128,"Tomorrow you will get a chance to fix the things you didn't fix today. To right the wrongs. Every time you wake up, no matter if you're bashing your phone at 6am or bashing your head at 6pm, is another chance you get.

Things that have been broken can't be unbroken, but you can build something new and beautiful from the pieces. Trust me. There is beauty in imperfection, and the life that stems from ruins is the strongest. Every scar, every wrinkle, every freckle painting itself on your face because you forgot to use sunscreen that day... that's life. That's memories. Some memories make us happy but even the ones that doesn't, they teach us.

And learning is the one thing we always have. We are a resilient species; we bounce back, adapt and evolve like no other. Take the pain, the sadness, the shame, and turn them into an advantage. Learn.

Tomorrow you can take the first step to fix your life. Or maybe not. It's ok! I love you all the same. Maybe it's not specifically tomorrow but two days, two months, two years from now. 

It's never too late. I believe in you. 

So if you get to it tomorrow, know that there is someone rooting for you. And if it takes you some time, I will still be rooting for you.

130,"Hello everyone I thought of writing this reddit post as I lay on my bed in the night.
I'm 17[M] and I hate myself this is a cry for help.
I have this ""everything will be fine"" attitude which is ruining my life.
I procastinate and procastinate and then procastinate some more.
I'm always like I'll do this tomorrow I have become a compulsive liar, when I sit down to study I would just keep doodling and lie to everyone and myself as well that no I have studied.
I am careless I never do any work on time, everything's always scattered.
Let me tell you this story a week ago I had my chem exam and I even had a holiday before it as a preparatory leave I didn't study then I was like it'll work out fine then on the day of the leave I didn't even open the book and slept and woke up early at 3 amand then started to find my notes which were in different pages in atleaet 10 fucking notebooks &amp;then still didn't  do shit till 5 and studied for 1 hour and now I'm failing in chem and I betchya my stupid fucking self will still want to stay the same.
Uptill the previous year this was my habit but to a far far lesser degree I was always like this studying a day before exam but then I actually studied the day before I was always this procastinator but not to this extent.
And this attitude has become so strong that when I even try to think about correcting myself  I can't it's like I turn into this one dimensional being who can't to anything productive and only wastes time and lies to himself and people who love him.
I know I am destroying my life I know I won't be able to make my dreams a reality if it continues like this but I can't I just can't.
I want to feel tension I want to feel worried I want to feel everything will not work out fine please help me.",30Sep2019,2
131,"I’ve been using Reddit for about 2/3rds of a year now, and I’ve really enjoyed it. But lately, things have changed. Nearly a month ago I  started freshman year in high school which is much more difficult than I was expecting. Everyday focusing on school alone I find a new thing to stress over to the point where I can’t focus and I’m just this physical form on anxiety. It always felt relaxing to get home and just scroll Reddit (and other sites) just to hopefully lower my worries. But then I’d forget about some assignments and this has caused my grades to plummet. I feel like an absolute moron seeing algebra sitting at a D. But I know that if I establish a few things I can easily just balance out my use of the internet and school work. And I would probably do that, but when you receive a DM from a random stranger telling you to kill yourself just because they thought you reposted something (even thought it wasn’t, it was a cross post) you just have to stop and think, “why do I even bother?” Some of the people on this site make me feel sick over the mindless things they say. I know it’s important to just ignore them, but when you know some people who actually would go through with these fucked yo things that people tell them to do it just makes me think “is the stuff I enjoy here worth it for the shit people say?” So I’m gonna give myself some time of parts of the internet. I’m still gonna use YouTUBE and Twitter because I find them less addictive and I feel I can actually get something out of them. I don’t know how long this hiatus will last but I know at one point I’ll come back. I know this is kinda a stupid thing to post on a site like Reddit because there isn’t much of a social aspect to this, but I just felt the need for some reason. So yeah, have a good one.

132,"Firstly, I'd like to say I tried. I tried very hard from 17-19 to find an apprenticeship in something mechanical related and this is what happened.

1. Got an interview for a construction apprenticeship - It was actually just an interview with an agency that ""might"" be able to get me further interviews (but didn't)
2. Same as above
3. Got an interview in welding and fabrication - When I got to the interview it was actually an interview for an IT role in a factory with welders, when I called them out on their incredibly misleading job advert they said ""well every tom dick and harry wants to be a welder, this is something actually unique!""
4. Got another interview for welding and fabrication, it was actually just an interview with a borderline conman/finance salesman who wanted to sell me a 5k loan so I could take bullshit online courses

The above are only the outrageous examples of my rejections. There were far far more.

With the college I was in at the time, they had people who would help you find jobs/apprenticeiships/training that you wanted. I applied for another and they told me that my ""acedemic qualifications were unsufficient"" despite that being totally untrue.

After that I was disheartened. I managed to get an office job in recruitment and one of the main things we did was ironically apprenticeships. Something that shocked my mind forever, there was one vacancy for an apprentice welder and there were 4,000 applicants.

Now I'm 25 and working in credit control. I hate it, I hate office work, I hate office life, I spent more time on Excel that I do with my family and at this age its basically impossible to change career. I'm totally jealous of my friends who work in bricklaying, construction, HVAC. It's painful, I dreamed of those jobs when I was younger and I assumed it was achievable yet it was always out of reach for me and I don't know why.

God it's shit. I hate my job, I hate my little office and I hate fucking capital radio that plays ALL DAY.",30Sep2019,7

135,"I don't want to live anymore, at least in this moment. I seem to constantly butt heads with my mother and she's emotionally abusive, though she doesn't realize it. She's a narcissist. Just a few minutes ago, she goaded me into a confrontation for no reason then pointed a finger at me once I got fed up. I walked away, slamming my door in the process, but I'm the crazy one.

I'm constantly behind on money and can't get a job. My mother's constant negativity doesn't help my confidence in this department and just sets me back. I'm afraid that if I do end up getting a job, I'll do something accidentally to mess up and get fired, making me even more unqualified for future opportunities. Or maybe it will take time away from the only thing I seem to be okay at right now - school.

I have no drive to do anything. I would lay in bed all day and sleep if I could. The only time I don't feel the emptiness and self-loathing is when I'm asleep. I am so exhausted.
