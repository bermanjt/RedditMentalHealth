0,"This is going to be a long post so I apologise. 

I have gone through so much in the past eight or so months. I'll start with a little background info. My parents never got married and lived apart. I lived with my mother but my earliest memory of her was being woken up early in the dawn by my father, who I barely recognized, telling me that she was gone.  I still don't know what really happened but I just know that she spent the following ten years in prison. 

I like to believe my father was/is a good person. I have no communication with him at all nowadays. He took in me and my little sister, who is four years younger than me. Little did I know the amount of neglect we would have to go through. My grandmother moved in with us because she saw what we were living through and was concerned. She had us move houses into one that didn't have multiple families living in it. Once that happened though is when things got bad. My father was gone for days at a time, and if he was home, his door was locked and my sister and I were ignored. My grandfather also lived with us and had dimensia and it was very hard to live with, but not because I understood what was wrong with him, it was because we were scared of him. My father came home to me in our shed locked from the inside after being chased around the house by my grandfather who was trying to get ahold of me and I didn't know what his intentions were, but he was very, very angry with me. I had done nothing but mind my own business. My grandmother was very controlling and if we didn't follow her direction s exactly, she would lash out. I was very very very self conscious about my appearance at school and one day I came home and since my hair wasnt in a pony tail all day, she dragged me by my hair to the kitchen, grabbed the scissors, and cut my hair to right below my ears. I lived my entire childhood with nothing but fear. Fear of being abused at home. Fear of judgement at school, which I received a lot of. These are just a few stories of hundreds that I had gone through during my elementary and middle school years. 

A number of years later my father meets this women who lives in a small town. He proposed and we move in with her, but he kicks out our grandmother. My sister and I are now going to different schools making different friends and yet things haven't gotten any better. Our fathers fiancé had begun mentally abusing us, and disrespecting the few belongings we had. My friends had convinced me to join a sport, and a couple of months later, my coach tells me she sees that things are very wrong and offers her home to me. I don't accept or deny the offer right away and keep it on hold. Until my father was gone for two weeks for a job offer, his fiance kicked me out. She threw trash bags at me and gave me until dark. I was out in less than an hour and was staying at a friend's house down the street until this blew over... but it never did. I receive a call in the middle of the night telling me I had one hour to be ready and move states, it was my father. I tried to convince him to let me move into my coaches house instead, but refuses. On the drive, his now EX fiance calls him and I overhear her saying that she had shot my dog in the head. The dog I've had since before I could remember anything. I had a really bad anxiety attack in the car and my father tells me it's my fault that I'm going through that. 

About a month later, we still don't have a secure place to live and he tells me I can move back and in with my coach. Living with another family made me almost feel like I was more of an outsider in this world and that I truly didn't belong anywhere but they did give me a lot of opportunities that I am grateful for.

Fast forward six years and I am now ""in college"" and mentally struggling harder than I ever have. In August of 2018, I was sexually assaulted by someone I thought I was close to. From September through December I was recieving various forms of sexual harassment from a group of guys all teamed up. I went through my first two semesters of college completely debt free, due to scholarships and FAFSA for almost all of it, and good financial planning for the rest. At least while I lived on campus which made it much more expensive for the first year. I was on track to graduating debt free, but ended up with thousands owed to the school for my father refusing to verify the FAFSA before the deadline (he had 11 months to electronically sign and it would take him two seconds and he knew the consequences). Because of that, my father will no longer talk to me and his wife, who I have never met, has actually texted me telling me how the financial crisis was all my fault. So now I suddenly have debt on my shoulders and because of that, I was forced to take this semester off to figure our finances. I am no longer apart of my team and I have nothing to do in my days. I have since gotten a job at Starbucks, and plan to utilize the tuition assistance program at ASU, the college I was already attending. 

Lately I have been struggling very very hard mentally and have been lashing out in anger to those closest to me. I have no idea why and I can't control it no matter how hard I try. I have more self hate right now than I ever have. I used to be a very happy person who forgave everything and didn't stress about anything. All of that is gone and I am very bitter now. I dont know what to do. My best coping mechanism used to be a pen and paper and writing out anything that my hand write and I would feel better and be happy. Writing doesn't work anymore, my mind blanks completely. It's not small flashes of self hate anymore, it's constant. It's no longer small windows of sadness, it's constant. I don't even recognize my personality anymore. I am not the ambitious, happy, adventurous person who took care of her body anymore. I am watching my muscles deteriorate in the mirror every week. Some weeks I barely eat.

2,"I was following Markiplier’s 24 hour charity livestream at the weekend and it was so much fun. On my current salary, I felt I could only sensibly donate a total of around $140-150, which was a tiny amount compared to what others did, but it still felt pretty good. After the stream ended, however, I was hit with a wave of just not finding the idea of doing anything appealing. Today, for example, I was hit by sudden stomach issues and I too ill to go into work, but I couldn’t do anything enjoyable to relax and try to get better, because I just didn’t feel like doing anything. I found assorted YouTube videos to put on, but then I would try to play a game and would instantly become disinterested. I’ve had this feeling before, but it doesn’t normally last more than a day.

So basically i get this feeling seemingly randomly, maybe a couple times a week, maybe I won’t have it for a few months, but when i get it i just feel gross and awkward and ashamed of my body or something. Nothing seems to trigger it, today i got it as i was standing at the reception area of my work wearing a summer dress and waiting to be picked up for a meeting. Its like i feel like im really exposed or vulnerable and i feel ashamed and embarrassed of who i am and where ive come from. I have a pretty typical lower to middle class upbringing, nothing dramatic i dont think. But this feeling it awful it just washes over me seemingly out of the blue and i just want to run away and hide or have the ground swallow me up. Thanks in advance for any help!",26Feb2019,2
7,"I don’t know where else to put this and this is probably going to be a rambling of me and my emotions/thoughts I guess. 



So I like this girl (we’re in high school) and we reconnected after 2 years of not talking to each other ever since freshman year of high school (thanks to me and my retarded ass). Anyway, I caught feelings for her again and when we talked, it was fun and engaging and all of that. We were both really into our conversations and when we texted, she was always engaged in texting back. Lately though for the past few weeks, she hasn’t been as responsive or engaged since she’s been pretty depressed lately due to personal stuff. Lately, I’ve been the one who carried our conversations and she usually gives replies that say “ohh” and “lol yea” and stuff like that (I mean it’s whatever. She probably doesn’t like talking to me and stuff so eh). 


Today, I asked her how her day was like usual and she said that it was alright but this dude made her day because he was fun to talk to, kind, very talented, and tall. She then told me that he made her have butterflies in her stomachs whenever she talked to him. She also said that she’s gonna hang out with him at this event this Saturday. She claims that she doesn’t know if her feelings are real or whatever and that she doesn’t wanna move things too quickly since she’s still recovering from a fairly recent break up, but let’s be honest, she likes him. It’s obvious. She probably doesn’t realize it or she probably doesn’t wanna make me sad or whatever (personally, who gives a shit about me? You can make me sad if you like). 

But I’m happy for her. I still like her and she’s one of the best things to have ever happened to me and I want to date her, but from the way she describes this guy, she appears to like him a lot. And I want her to get better and be happy with whoever she wants. If she likes him then hey, he’s a better dude than me for her to date. He sounds like a really nice dude and I hope he treats her well at this event this coming Saturday. No hard feelings for either of them since they should do what makes them happy. I shouldn’t be part of the equation. 

If we’re being honest though, I am kind of jealous. I mean, I still like her and everything. I want to ask her out and go out with her. It’d make my year if she wants to go out with me. But I guess the universe doesn’t work like that and is funny in how it works, so I guess she fell for someone else. Oh well, life’s a bitch sometimes and that’s just how things are. It is what it is ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ and well hey, tough shit, I guess I’ll just have to handle it. Not much I can do but support her and hope her well. ",26Feb2019,1

9,"I don't think a message has made me want to cry this badly in a long, long time. It made me feel so accepted and appreciated, and even if the feeling only lasted a little bit, it still was there.

For someone who always is afraid to talk about her issues because she doesn't want to be seen as just 'another edgy teen' or bother people, this helped a lot. Whenever I do try and vent through messages or posts online I always do it in a joking manner to try and make it seem as if I'm just making more edgy jokes, but I guess today it seemed less jokey because I was in a bad state.

So to Aera, I know I may not be the most helpful person, or the nicest, or happiest, or smartest, or funniest, yet you still made sure I was okay and told me that I wasn't edgy, and that I was valid. I know I wasn't the best at showing my appreciation because all I know how to do is talk in jokes and memes, but I hope you realize just how much those few words had an affect on me, and just how thankful I am to have you as my friend.",26Feb2019,3

12,"I’m was recently diagnosed with clinical depression. I struggled with it for a long time undiagnosed and prior to this my parents had no knowledge of it. The doctor recommended and my parents really want me to visit a counselor, however I am very much against this. I agreed to meet with one a few weeks ago and I just feel like it doesn’t help at all. It’s a waste of money and time and most importantly when I’m not feeling depressed I don’t want to go somewhere that reminds me of my depression and makes me talk about it because that just makes me more depressed. 

I’m a very independent person and I think they take this as me not appreciating them or not loving them. I want to get out of the house and into a dorm a few states away as soon as I can but it’s mostly just about me wanting and needing to be independent. I feel like figuring out my life and trying to understand what I’m doing is something that will help with my depression.

I’ve been arguing a lot with them, more than usual, because I disagree with them on how to take care of myself and I don’t want them to be so involved. I know every teenager (I’m 17) wants to be more independent but it’s something that always bothers me. It feels like whenever I’m finally having a good day I get into an argument with them and I go back to being depressed. Anyone have any advice?",26Feb2019,2
13,"So, let me put some context here: I met this girl online over three months ago, with no particular purpose in mind, just, you know, casual. We then went out on a meet up (I wont call it a date because it wasn't) and at some point near the end I asked if I could kiss her ('cause, you know, i'm an idiot and I've been feeling lonely for a while now), but she said she wasn't looking for anything serious nor even a hook up, just friends to hang out with, and after a very awkward half an hour she left. We stayed in touch, kinda ignoring the uncomfortable part of the meet up, and became very close friends, to the point where I feel I can talk to her about anything, she tells me very personal stuff and I help her figure things out if I'm able to do so,  we hang out often, things like that. 

Back to a couple of weeks ago, she've been acting weird with me, or at least that's what I've perceived. She texts me a lot, ask me to just go and stay with her at uni (we go to the same college), and when we're together she gets all hugging with me, aside from the fact that she's always inviting me to parts of the campus where there's virtually zero people. It's weird because so far in our time being friends I was usually the one who was always asking to see each other, starting the conversations, etc, like, I was the one with the inciative. 

Now, I know this might doesn't mean anything, or that I might be blowing things out of proportion and these things I've mentioned are just plain and simple friendly behavior, but I do have feelings for her, and they're getting stronger the more I see her, I'm just afraid of doing any kind of advances on her because of the initial rejection when we met (she left very clear she wasn't looking to be with anyone), and I'm also afraid to lose her as a friend, because I REALLY ENJOY OUR TIME TOGETHER, I can also be a very anxious/shy person, so naturally I have no idea of what to do.

14,"I think ever since i was a kid, ive had a hard time maintaing friends. I feel as i have gotten older im more outgoing and outspoken.

I have OCD/Anxiety and maybe at time a little dissociated. Past Trauma stuff.

i have moved to a new city and am trying to make new friends.

Anyways, it feels like i am always the instigator. The one who makes plans. I always try to put on a good front and be cheerful when meeting people. I have been more up front and asked for numbers with people who have some like minded hobbies. And we talk and all seems well. But it seems it doesn't go anywhere past that. 

Example. i moved to a new city. One of my best friends from high school has been living here for 8 years now. He knows i have moved here. But not once in the past 3 months since i have been here has he texted me to hang. Let me take that back. He HAS texted me about a month ago to say he wants to get together soon. But that was it??? i mean c'mon? I texted him yesterday to tell him that we should hang out this weekend, and he said cool blah blah blah insert typical friendly comment. 

i feel as though i get brushed off alot. Maybe its the way i talk, look etc. 

I also noticed i attract weirdos alot, people who are off center, usually in a bad way. Then i have to distance myself.

Not sure what im doing wrong? i feel i have a good heart, and i feel like i just want to have a good relationship with anyone. But i just feel alone.

Anyone else feel like this?",26Feb2019,1
15,"Whenever I have the mental clarity to focus on things other than my head (which is rare these days) I make people see me the way I want them to see me. I create a whole persona that I don’t feel is my real self, but is how I wish I actually was. If I lose the control of the image I feel like cutting myself off the person I showed it to. I dissect the way people react to things to predict how they think so I know what they plan to do and why. I test them sometimes to get a better idea of what person they are and what they respond well to and do subliminal things to make them like me and think I’m someone that I am not. I also don’t always test people to get to know them, sometimes it’s just for fun and I don’t feel like I cause much harm in it at all especially since they don’t know what I’m doing. 

I can’t tell if this is something normal or not because I do it automatically without thinking about it. I thought it was pretty normal but I recently saw a reddit where someone was called manipulative for it and now I don’t know :/ should I change? ",26Feb2019,6
17,"Last night I was walking home from the store with my arms full of groceries and my headphones in. My headphones have never done this before but they started zapping my right ear, not anything painful, just a dull little *zzp* but it was annoying. I took my right bud out because I didn’t want to deal with it, my groceries were heavy.. and just kept walking. 

Then my left earbud zapped me even harder to where it actually hurt a little bit. More like a *zzzzzzzp.* I set my groceries down for a second, took my headphones off and put them in my bag. Picked my groceries back up, about 3 minutes from home. 

There’s this little spot on my street where there’s a big bush and you can’t always see what’s coming. It looked clear to me, I couldn’t see any headlights so I started to cross. Just as I got about 5ft across, a car comes zooming up the road fast as hell, not paying attention, not slowing down and it threw me off the road. 

I was thinking about it, and had I not taken the extra second to take my headphones off, I very well could have gotten hit by that car. The short in my crappy headphones might have saved my life 🤷🏻‍♀️",26Feb2019,122

It’s a unique kind of sleep, at least in my opinion. Much deeper, more intense, and more satisfying.

32,"This was very long ago, but this is what I remember of what happened. 
It started roughly when I (21F) was about 5 or 6, I would go to my three cousins house and when I was there we would play one of my favourite games, playing pretend with baby dolls. 
One of my cousins (would have been 8 or 9) would then say to me that to have a baby you need to have sex, but being that age I didn’t really understand much about sex or anything so I went to his room, this happened a phew times I recall and I would always go with him because he had some fun games to play in his room. 
I remember trying to leave his room but I could never work out the door handle, he either locked it or maybe you had to turn it the opposite way around for it to open, I’m not sure. 
He would then show me his penis and ask me if I wanted to touch it or lick it, I remember I would touch it to be able to get out of the room, I can’t remember exactly if I did anything else or him to me, I think I have blocked a bit out.

There was another time when we were a little bit older, I was maybe 8 or 9 (he would have been 11 or 12) he took me around the corner from my Nan’s house into a area of units, which a lot of bushy areas. I asked if it was okay to be there and he said yes, he goes there all the time. 
That’s when my dad came and found us, as he didn’t know where I had gone. Looking back, I’m not sure if he was planning to do anything that day. 

I’ve only ever told two friends over the years but I’m just wondering if I am over reacting about this, as we were both really young. But I still feel like he should have known better, even being that young. Could he have even assaulted anyone else? Like his younger sister?

I became a manager at my first job when I was 19 and a supervisor of my current job at 21, although I stepped down from that position since.

I dive into the cyberspace and get lost in a multitude of things - video games, YouTube, binging shows, etc. I think the reason this routine is so addictive is because I'm scared of reality.

I have sacrificed so many hobbies and things I used to do religiously because I am scared or nervous. Even typing this, I feel out of place. I'm an extremely introverted person and I rarely talk about anything personal with my closest friends, let alone post them publicly. When people speak to me about problems, though, I always try to find ways to help them in any way. I have tried to overcome this ""fear"" but to no avail.

35,"Way too many of us are limiting our lives by fear, be it fear of failure, fear of rejection, fear of being judged, fear of other people's opinion, fear of getting mocked, fear of getting laughed at, or any other kind of fear. Way too many of us are not living our lives to our full potential.

We all have grand dreams, we all want to succeed in every single area of life, make ton of money, be rich, famous etc. but how many of us are getting what we want? Think about it for a moment.

People are afraid of trying something new (or taking action) because they think they might fail. And they think if they fail then others will laugh at them. People are afraid of speaking in public, and interacting with other people. Reason? Fear of being judged by other people. People don't feel comfortable expressing their views and opinion. Reason? Fear of conflict. You see how this works?

Here is the truth, at least my truth: all of us can achieve all our dreams. As humans we are all equal. If one person can do it then every other person absolutely can! There is no rocket science to it.

One thing that limits us is fear. And that's why in this video I explain what fear is, why we limit ourselves by it, and most importantly how one can overcome it.

I’ve been living in the same condo for the past 3 years while I’m in undergrad. My dad bought this condo as an investment property and was gracious in letting me stay here. The average age here is around mid 60s and Caucasian and I’m the youngest resident (22F). I’ve noticed more over the past year and a half how rude and racist some of the residents are. I’m Caucasian and my boyfriend is Hispanic and looks very racially ambiguous. He’s told me for quite some time that the people here are rude to him, which I’ve recently been able to witness. He definitely gets a lot of dirty looks, people don’t hold the door for him and he’s been asked if he should be here multiple times. A week ago I ordered ubereats and the deliverer was a  middle aged black man. He called me somewhat emotional saying that a woman in the lobby started screaming at him saying he wasn’t allowed inside and she doesn’t believe he had any business being on this property. The woman left my food on my doorstep and unfortunately I didn’t see her (so I could figure out who she is) or get the chance to speak with her. I feel awful for the deliverer and I hate the idea that people might be discriminated against in this complex. I order food regularly so it’s not a rare occurrence for uber deliverers to be here either. 

Also this is petty but everyone gets on the elevator before I can get out which is rude imo. I just tried to get out of the elevator on my floor and some woman stopped me as I was exiting and said this is the second floor is this where you’re supposed to be? Idk just thought it was strange. 

Kinda rambled, let me know if this is unfortunately typical, weird  or if I’m dramatizing these situation(s)? 

TL;DR People in my complex are old, white and seem pretty racist

This time feels different because I think I’m finally beginning to accept it. Growing up in care with nobody to rely on causes so much damage to a person. I spent my 20s trying to catch up with what I missed out on in my childhood but fell way short of that goal. Now in my 30s, I’m at risk of making the same mistakes by chasing after the impossible.  
I am without friends for the umpteenth time in my life and this time it was my own fault. I ditched them out of fear and now I am left with nothing but regret about it.

50,"No spoilers ahead. 

I've been learning Italian in college and a few months back started watching Suburra: Blood on Rome on Netflix. It turned out to be an absolutely amazing show. Well, the second season just came out a couple days back and I just finished it, and I am in shock. It was just... fuck, man. Now I'm on a semester abroad in Italy, but still haven't found anyone here who watches this show.

Since this show isn't in English, it probably won't get the due that it deserves. Netflix always makes quality content, and this is just another example. This show is nearly on par with many other dramas I've watched, like Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones. I highly recommend giving it a chance if you are looking for something to watch.

If anyone has seen this show and is caught up, I would love to hear what you thought. Don't forget your spoiler tags.

61,"Social situations are always so exhausting for me mentally.  Situations at work where I am supposed to be ""networking"" I generally just stand around and look awkward.  It takes a lot of work to think of things to say to people I don't really know, even if it's just chit chat. I end up getting anxious that I'm not talking to more people and then that makes me frustrated and even more anxious.  When I attempt to small talk my mind just literally goes blank and freezes up.  I even sort of stutter because I can't think of the words I want to use. 

Even just hanging out with my friends I feel awkward a lot. Most of my friends like to talk and sometimes it's hard to keep up, by the time I think of something to say the conversation has moved on, and if I think of something to say it always feels like I'm interrupting.

I generally feel like a bad husband, I try to spend as much time with my wife as I can but I know she wants me to be more talkative, more open, more intimate, etc.  After a while I get exhausted with the constant interaction and I push away even though I love her dearly.  She gets hurt and then I feel even more awful about myself. 

I could go on and on.  I've heard plenty of labels for it, like social anxiety, I'm an introvert, I might be slightly autistic, maybe I'm just shy, maybe I'm just stupid, maybe I just don't care.  So I feel like everyone else expects me to be more socially comfortable, but I don't know why it is so hard.  It's holding me back in my career because I come off sounding stupid and it hurts my marriage and friendships. 

Is there honestly anything I can do about it?  Some people have said just practice talking to strangers, but in my life I've talked to plenty of them and have never gotten more comfortable with it. The only thing that's ever helped is alcohol, but it's no longer worth it the way I feel the next day.  ",26Feb2019,2
62,"I don't really know how to explain this so i'm just going to be direct. Over the last few years of my life dreams that I have had as a child are more or less happening in real life. It isn't weird dreams like apocalyptic or anything like that but more so relating to me and my life. Just recently I went to Pittsburgh from where I live (DC Suburbs) as someone who I feel a deep connection to asked me to come to a religious convention type thing. I'm not a very religious person, it hasn't really appealed to me till pretty much this trip. I vividly remember a dream I had when I was maybe 7 or 8 where I was in a city at night and was getting food with who in the dream was revealed to be a partner/spouse, we went to eat at a restaurant and I don't remember eating, just going into the lobby of the hotel it was in. Well when the first night came along and I was exploring the city I started having like flashbacks  to the dream and noticed a lot of the buildings in the dream like one PPG place,The hotel/convention center my friend stayed at, and the U.S steel tower.

 I had never been to this city prior to this or even really looked it up, I've always been enamored by my two local major cities specifically DC and never really traveled out of the area or had a reason to. But I met my friend who I feel major feelings for in the lobby of his hotel when they got there, it felt familiar but on the second night we got food together at the burger place in the lobby, and it just clicked. It wasn't an exact replica of the dream but it  followed along way too close for comfort. This isn't the only dream like this i've had as I had one about my first job which came true, my graduation, and a few other events in my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

During one of the sermons they talked about divine timing and God giving visions to Joseph in his dreams. Again, I've never been religious, I call myself jewish as it was something I felt I could cling to my mother with, but it just kinda felt like all of this has been happening for a reason if that makes sense. This genuinely makes me feel insane but I regularly see a psychiatrist and all I have is ADHD, which I take my meds for.

No wonder suicide rates are rising fucking retards are running the country.

Atleast the doc told me that I could get a waiver for it. I am going to try but deep in my mind i know they are going to reject me again because this is no 'temporary' condition it's a allergy it's permanent.

That sort of judgement leads me to believe that a waiver wouldn't do much but I will still try.

71,"Pariah. A synonym for outcast. Somebody who spends their time alone instead of with friends. Someone who feels only the cold embrace of nothing while others feel the warm embrace of friendship. 

I do not know when this word became familiar to me, and yet it's meaning was immediately understood. Growing up in grade school I was always taunted by the other kids. I grew up in a neighborhood of delusional suburbanites, yet fortunately my family's property was large enough that I didn't have to worry about any neighbors. The words of my peers stung like a million hornets, yet I was never sure of what I did to provoke the nest. 

I had friends sometimes. One of them lived on the other side of the forest that separated our houses. He still talks to me luckily. And yet I spend my days looking at a small screen with it's artificial light illuminating the hollow shell that I see myself so rapidly becoming. Friend ends with end, and I see an end to all of my friendships in given time. I put in the effort still and I hope they continue to do the same. Time will tell. 

In high school I used to fear that I would never find a girlfriend. A real fear for me, until I met her. She was everything I could've asked for. I was utterly devastated when she left my life, just like everyone else. I am not sure what the concern of a relationship was, when I still had trouble forming relationships with friends. 

I do not ask for a girlfriend. I don't even ask for a friend. In solitude I have begun to find a certain sense of comfort that I can't get anywhere else. My story will be forgotten, and the binary 1s and 0s that translate to you as words now will degrade in given time. And that is fine. I do not want to be remembered. I want to be forgotten. 

And such is the nature of the outsider. I will sit in my meager kingdom of nothing and continue my squabbles as if there was some sort of reason behind them. I will continue to pursue goals whether or not anybody notices or cares. But what I anticipate the most is the day that nobody cares. When nobody cares, I can finally stop pretending to have a reason to. And I will bask in my own social status of pariah. ",26Feb2019,1
