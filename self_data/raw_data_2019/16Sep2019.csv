Just needed to vent about this and I know that title makes me sound so entitled. My parents raised me in BFE (bum fuck egypt) I felt like I missed out on a lot of cool things in my childhood, and that sounds like such first world problems I know. 



About 3 years ago I became really sick and am in a wheelchair I lost my good job in a nice city and I’m back at home and I feel like Im going to be trapped here forever. I want to go back to school but I have problems with an old school not releasing my transcripts, I can’t find a handicapped friendly job in my very small town, I have to do odd jobs for money. None of the doctors in my town or in towns near me know how to treat the condition I have. 

I’m so sad here my friends have moved on and moved to different states, they can walk to the nearest mall, there’s always concerts near by. 

I just can’t understand why my parents decided to come back to this busted town, they both left this town when they were my age because they hated it here. 

I feel so bad for being upset over it, I know they have their reasons but I can’t help to think if I was in a more developed area things would be different for me, and for all of us. 

I’m trying to do everything I can to get out of this sad miserable place but it seems like I take two steps (or should I say rolls) backwards everytime I try. 

Thanks for listening~",16Sep2019,2

4,"I'm not proud to say it, but it's so difficult for me to care about other people. I don't mean that I wouldn't care if they died. I have empathy. I'm not autistic (though I seriously considered it for an hour) or sociopathic. I never really grew up with a sense of community. My family was never my friends. 

It's not like I grew up with no friends. I've always stuck with close friends until now. But even they were no exception to this, for the most part. I feel like my only value is being funny, and what I seek in others is validation. I can't offer anyone emotional gratification of any sort. I straight up can't reciprocate conversation very well because I don't really care about most things that much.

Perhaps it's my narrow set of interests - video games, programming, and the internet. Perhaps it's my depression that just doesn't allow me to find interest in other people anymore.

Can anyone help me with this? I've been searching for the answer for quite a while, and I just can't really find it.",16Sep2019,2
5,"Yesterday evening my husband and I found a cat around our condo building. I must say, it was the first time in the couple years I've been living in this country that I saw a stray cat. I always thought we didn't have those because winters are brutal and people are more responsible, but well, I was just naive.  I thought that this kitty may need help, who knows, food, shelter, maybe she was just far from home, lost. I don't know, I just got confused in feelings and took the cat home, my home. Husband was supportive but doubtful. I shared it in the city lost &amp; found pets social media to see if we found the owner. I was called out for having taken the cat as apparently the protocol is to take the photo, share it, but leave the car where it was. Sounds logic. Ok, I understand now, I made a mistake. I probably kidnapped this cat over the night. But I had good intentions. And I was getting along with her really good. I cried a bit (ok, more than a bit) when having to put her back outside and walk away. I feel so silly.",16Sep2019,3

10,"We were just so close. Honestly probably the closest friend I've ever had. We met at a choir camp in high school and became friends really fast. We found out we were going through surprisingly similar things mentally and were even on the same antidepressant, a lot of the same problems etc. We bonded pretty quickly over that and music, and some other stuff.


Got to a point where we were really supportive of each other, texting or calling to check in, things like that. Went with her in the car when she went to inpatient and visited. 


And even though we live about an hour apart we both made trips to visit each other. We knew each others' families (played video games with her little brother all the time) and everything. It was a genuine connection I thought



Then literally like one day it was that and the next she disappeared. She hadn't totally cut off all communication but she was a totally different person. Every conversation we had was superficial and it was like we didn't know each other. It was flipping a switch. 



It was almost 2 years ago now and I'm still upset sometimes. I know I shouldn't care but I still catch myself doing it. I think it's the not knowing that's hardest. Just why?? I think if she had just said fuck off it would be easier, but just the ghosting is ugh",16Sep2019,1
11,"I’m trying really hard to keep myself together right now, but no one can hurt your feelings like your children! 
My husband and I have been married for 16 years. We have 4 children, 3 of whom are living and one has already moved out. We had savings and money when we first got married. Our child died and we spent everything on her funeral and just living through that year. We started again with nothing and had to raise our 3 children and live.
My husband has had the same job for 12 years. We own a small home and I am a SAHM and driver for our younger kids. We barely make it because, we make sure our children are provided for, and our bills are paid. Lately we have been struggling  because I am restructuring our finances so we can start saving for our next home. Today I called my eldest to see if I could borrow some money. I’m sure they didn’t do it on purpose but, the comments made had me feeling like I’m an irresponsible person! I quickly retracted my question and got off the phone to go cry.

I'm already depressed to the point of barely being able to get out of bed most days and top of it all I have to somehow fucking manage this horrible horrible financial situation I've created for myself. 




It's all so complicated and I have no idea how to do any of it even if I were in a normally functional state. And I have nobody to ask. I hate myself so much and I realized I've ruined my own life. No matter depression or not they don't give a damn, you owe the money either way and they'll still ruin you if you don't pay it. Which has already happened.



At this point it's making my suicidal thoughts much worse, because I know no matter if I can get through this now I'll be dealing with the extreme consequences of my situation for 10+ years. There is no way out now. It will *always* be bad for me now no matter what.

15,"Before I post this and some people's heads explode, I want to make some things clear:

1. I like and respect women and think they should have the same rights and life options as men.
2. I have male and female children whom I love equally and for whom I want the very best.
3. I have no problem admitting if I am wrong or not seeing something. If I am, please point it out.
4. I am not advocating any position or even offering solutions. I am simply asking questions.

Ok, my question is three-fold:

1. Assuming the ultimate goal of the modern feminist movement is total social and economic parity for all people, how do/will they see the possible legal and social issue of woman's monopoly on reproductive rights? If we are all 'equal', why do men have no say if a woman decides to exercise her legal right to abortion when both of them created the pregnancy? Why are women permitted to name a man as 'the father' on a birth certificate when she knows he is not, without repercussion? 

2. My suspicion is that they will support no change to these and other similar issues. If that is the case, how can they claim equality is their goal when their true position, when all is added up, would be superior?

3. As I stated above, I have no answers to offer. Perhaps some kind of separate-but-equal is possible. What do you think an actual parity between all people would look like?",16Sep2019,2
18,"I have always been a very goal-oriented person. I graduated high school early and planned to move to a MUCH bigger city in a different state for college.

But anyway that’s not what this post is about

Idk if I’m even surprised bc I’ve known that she hated me for a long time. But to hear her say it just stung so bad. She said it a bunch in a fit of rage today after throwing a glass and shattering it. 

I’m not entirely blameless for the situation, I got a piercing in my nose and I hid it from her. That was wrong I guess but she went totally nuclear and I used every skill I’ve ever learned in therapy to try to have a constructive conversation, then I tried to at least diffuse her anger, I tried to end the conversation so we could talk later in a less emotional state but she would not back down. She was screaming at me and saying the most horrible things, like how I ruin every good thing in her life and I’m tearing the family apart, that I’m diminishing everything she’s worked for for me to have a good life, that I’m not what she’s signed up for...

I’ve been hearing variations of this since I was 12,13 years old and it’s gotten worse over time but today was the absolute worst. Her words stung so bad.

I try to help him in anyway I can, though I really can’t do much. I usually sit with him as he works, doing nothing but staring into space to not enjoy myself alongside him, but all I end up doing is bothering him with chatter or little noises I make while fidgeting.

There's just no point. Even if I learned to manage my depression there is no good future waiting for me. My life will only ever be *ok* at best. That's the absolute best I can hope for, and that would be after suffering for more years and years than I already have. More likely it'll always be bad.


There's the question of if things will get better and I already think that's a no for a lot of reasons, but there's also the question of if the pain is worth whatever that might be. Nobody ever asks that question. Certainly nobody who doesn't feel this way. They can't comprehend how it could just straight up not be worth it even if it hypothetically does eventually get better.


Choosing not to end your life is knstead *actively choosing* to suffer for an unknown amount of time. (It might be forever. This is still no guarantee anything does improve). For me it'll be probably 10+ years before there's even a CHANCE of anything being *okay.* Mediocre.



I'm already at 5 so suffering a total of 15 years in absolute hell for what? 40 years of working 9-5? The chance to pay taxes?

36,"Dude why does everything seem so hard. I feel like I don’t know how to do anything, and I kind of don’t, which is stupid because you’re supposed to learn that’s what life is, but I feel like I don’t know how to learn. I don’t love anything, there is no career path that I feel like I can start and end up loving, everything is just lukewarm to me. Everyone is constantly like “well what do you like?” Am I really the only person that doesn’t really like anything? Well, I guess I should say that I just feel the same about everything, there’s never really been anything that just stuck out to me or that I was naturally good at. 

I thought I had decided I wanted to go back to school, I change my life decisions every day. While reading up on majors, I specially see myself looking for majors that will likely require few to no group work, no language requirement, give me a high salary, no labs, and won’t be impossible for me to pass. FWI, this major doesn’t exist lol. I’m socially stunted but hide it semi well, with no desire to be around people unless I learn how to make friends because right now I’m fucking horrible at it. I don’t think there’s any way I could successfully graduate college or survive a legitimate work environment. 

I just don’t feel like I can be an adult. I don’t know where I went wrong or if I was just born like this, but somewhere along the line I just didn’t pick up the skills necessary for socializing personally or professionally. I have no idea how I’m expected to act to other people in a career or really at any job or school or anything. How do I possibly learn that? My only out seemed like finding a job where I could work alone. But I can’t seem to find many of those. When I research absolutely any major, people say they don’t actually love their career or that it’s very difficult or something. The smart part of me is like, okay well there’s always going to be people that hate it. Maybe I won’t hate it, maybe it won’t be difficult for me. But what if I do and what if it is, what if I waste money and time that I don’t have on something I don’t love? How do I know what I love? 

I can’t just do nothing, people already hate me because they know I do nothing. Am I such a villain for not knowing what I want? At this point even I’m kind of like, okay, but really, you’re taking too long to figure this out. But I can’t help it, I go into fight or flight mode when making any decision and my instinct is always flight.

Anyways I don’t know why I’m saying any of this, I just wish something in my mind was like DO THIS so I could find some kind of motivation. How can I make myself do something I don’t want, where do I develop the drive to be an active member of society if there is absolutely nothing I like about this system. I want to be normal and don’t know how, and people really are starting to treat me like an outcast because they think I’m pretty so they expect me to be some kind of shining member of the community and like have an awesome career and a hot husband and like whatever else the modern western world wants me to create for myself. If the goal is to just work hard even if you don’t love it, I’ll do that I just need to know that’s what I’m striving for. I need direction. But no, from birth through high school I was taught to never settle for salary or what has the most jobs or what people respect and to just do WHAT YOU LOVE and then you get in the real world and everyone judges you for that, honestly. Which if I actually had something I truly loved I don’t think I would care, but I don’t have anything close. 

I’m just frustrated, I feel entitlement oozing from my pores simply because I’m sitting here complaining about not having the perfect career that I love that’s easy and pays well and not knowing everything blah blah blah there are so many people who don’t get to just sit here twiddling their thumbs trying to figure out their life, so many people that are struggling and have to provide for families or don’t have family. I want to be more appreciative but im feeling so left behind in life. I can’t help it, I want all the answers, I want to know how happy I should be and what I should expect and what I should want. I feel like something is wrong with me. I hate being around people and I don’t drive because it scares me, I don’t want to learn and honestly I think life in general scares me and I’m avoiding living.

37,"For a long time now I've been struggling with depression and it is the worst. I don't know if you understand the symptoms, but the only way I can describe is: You are not sad, you are not happy. You are just empty. Without feelings, without anything.

And you can't get out by yourself. People think you can. People that love me and respect me say that I need to choose to not be like this. 3 days ago was my birthday and I stayed locked in my room doing nothing. A great person in my life said that I had to chose into making it a great day or a bad day, so I had to let myself do stuff. I couldn't answer that in a positive way. There is no alternative, there is no control.

If someone is in an accident and break both legs and need to be in a wheelchair for a couple of months, you don't see them and say ""hey, you are not running because you are letting yourself be in your position"", or ""you can run if you permit yourself."" But for mental illness, as they are less relatable and less visible, so people just can't understand. I, myself, can't understand. I always finish my day thinking I will be able to do the most simple stuff. Clean my room, wake up early, or wake up whenever and just get over bed... and I can't get over my bad for hours. I wake up 7 am and I leave my bed sometimes after 1 PM. The most stupid thing and I cannot do. 

I don't see friends, I don't see family, I don't enjoy life, my only desire is to fantasize death and feel good about the impossible results it might have. It is a horrible lifestyle and I wish cure for everyone in this situation.

I was studying right now, but I am tired and I am going to sleep. Tomorrow it will repeat, the same fucking boring and painful day, probably not seeing anyone as I have a day off. Eat something I don't enjoy because I lost my inherent energy to have good food.

It is a constant battle, and for that I made myself a letter. I sent to myself to read it tomorrow or whenever. Here it is:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You can’t snap out of it. You just can’t. It is with you. You can’t snap out of it.  
&gt;  
&gt;You now are thinking tomorrow you are going to wake up and do stuff immediately! You have plans, priorities, deadlines, important things to do. Yet you know you won’t. You never do. For years now. Your brain is taking away pieces of your life, forcing you to be shut down for hours before doing anything, and when you do, you do it poorly. You are inside of it and you can’t get out. You are trapped in your own brain. You are killing yourself slowly while you think on ways of doing it quickly.   
&gt;  
&gt;Maybe force yourself out of it. Break the cage. You are strong but you need to be stronger. Get out of it. Disrupt your blockage. Hurt yourself in the process, it is a run for your life. Feel the pain to remember you can. You need to get out. You need to break it free.   
&gt;  
&gt;Force yourself, shape your environment. Design your cave and paint your forest. Ask for help. Be open about it. Make this hazard lose its strength by being stronger than it.   
&gt;  
&gt;And don't fool yourself. It IS stronger than you right now and you know it. Or let yourself die in misery, feeling nothing but worthlessness and less, or die in battle. Confront this beast, tame the devil inside you. It is eating you alive and you are losing this war. Go without grace, without limbs and lungs. And scream without voice and see, with your eyes shut, the impossibility you are going to achieve.   
&gt;  
&gt;You are already dead, so rise up and hunt the hell out of this fucking depression.   
&gt;  
&gt;See you tomorrow. ",16Sep2019,1
38,"I've got somewhat limited dating experience, and lately I've been pouring most of my time into work, but I'm always open to giving it a go if something comes up.

Well I met a girl earlier this year. I didn't really notice her immediately, but we hung out a few times and slowly built up a bit of a friendship. Then last week she turns up the friendliness tenfold. She started touching my arm every second sentence, opened up to me about some personal experiences and feelings, and started messaging me several times a day when we were both at home. 

After about a week of that, and thinking over whether or not I was interested, I came to a place where I was willing to give things a go with her and see where it went.

Today we met up and spent the morning together. She brought me a bubble tea. She kept putting her hand on my arm and leaning into me. Eventually we went to get some lunch together, and the topic of dating apps came up. It seemed like a good segue into figuring out what she was thinking, so I asked if she was interested in going out.

She was so shocked to hear me ask, and said, ""No no I'm sorry I'm not looking for anyone right now, I'm just way too busy with everything.""

I mean I still felt pretty take-it-or-leave-it about the whole thing, but I'm absolutely floored that she wasn't interested after all that. How am I ever supposed to read into a girl's hints after something like that?",16Sep2019,6
39,"TL;DR (but please read): I am depressed and miserable because I feel that I missed out on certain types of experiences of the “normal” kid, teen, and young adult due to failing to socially bond.

This will probably sound immature and stupid, but it’s not something I’m thinking about just impulsively on a whim. I’ve had these thoughts for a long time. So hear me out.

I’m an only child. Growing up, I had some friends, but never truly bonded closely with kids my age. I was not a total loner by any means. I had acquaintances in elementary, middle, and high school. I wasn’t bullied. I lived on the outskirts of town, in a rural area, so there was no playing with kids my age outside. My parents were not the types who were popular and connected to others their age in town. I attended a good school district in a suburban area. I was a disciplined and smart kid. Did well academically and played two sports: baseball and golf. But ultimately, I failed socially. I always preferred to be independent and do things on my own, or spend time with adults. I would go to school, converse with all my acquaintances, go home and be alone…surf the Internet, play video games, go to baseball practice, etc. But never really bonded and made friends with kids my own age.

In a nutshell, I believe it is this social failure to which I can attribute to why I feel empty and miserable today. Or at the least, my interpretation of this situation. Fast forward to today: I attend a very large public university. But I started at a very small branch campus to which I commuted for the first 2 years while working my job a local business. I made no real friends at that branch campus. You’re probably asking about my personality/self-presentation. I was never in the super popular “jocks” or “cool kids” groups, but I was never a nerd or a loser either. I was sort of in the middle. Disciplined, introverted. Decent looking but not super attractive. I’ve always tried to dress how the cool guys my age do, though. Sporty, well-taken care of.

Anyway, I was doing some soul searching for a while in terms of what I wanted to major in/do with my life. I was interested in science, politics, and big-picture things like that. I jumped around a couple of times. Then I transferred to the main campus of my university, which is the “true” college environment. However, I never got to live in the dorms on campus; I had to get an apartment off campus with randomly selected roommates. So once again: lack of social bonding. My roommates for the past 2 years have been very introverted too and we just do our own thing and barely talk.

I settled on a STEM major that I really liked, so that’s good. Now I’m a senior and will be graduating this coming May. My grades have been good, and I’ve had a couple student org leadership positions, and I’ve gotten some scholarships and other recognitions, so I’ve got things going pretty well for me there. I haven’t had an internship but I’ve been working for a family business in the summers because it payed really well and I basically support myself through college and need money badly. 

But I have daily walking depression and deep inside, I feel empty and miserable. Why? Because I feel like I missed out on so many of the fun experiences that are sometimes part of becoming an adult. Now, as I said earlier, I’m pretty disciplined, forward-thinking, and mature. I’m even very anti-alcohol because I’ve seen it destroy people, and I don’t even like it anyway so I am very against drinking culture and you’d never see me in a drunken environment.

But I’m not against all teenage experiences. When I look around and see other people who seem to be much happier…have their social groups…have had the common teen and young adult experiences like doing risky things, smoking some weed, being a little wild, etc. I get depressed that I was never in that environment. I’m not one of those who is completely content being alone and independent and with my life as it is; now that I’m older, I wish I would have been different when I was younger. I wish I would have not failed socially. I wish I would have gone to more events when I was invited, before I stopped being invited. I wish the cards would have fallen so that I lived in the dorms to begin college and bonded with people my own age. I wish I would have taken some risks, like smoking some weed (which I did still a little anyway, but not with real “friends”…unrelated story…) and being invited to some parties. I wish I would have gained some true friends and gained some social recognition...you know, the bro hugs and sharing living space, etc. That way, I could have used my judgement to determine what “fun” I wanted to partake in and what was too stupid/risky. But I never even got a taste of any of it…

And it’s not that I’m afraid of social interaction. Maybe I used to be a little, but by my late teens, I was totally fine. I can talk to anyone very confidently. I can give presentations in class. I am highly liked by my professors because of my work ethic and focus. It’s just that when I was younger, I guess I preferred to be alone. That behavior over time led to me failing to bond with people. 

So now here I am, a senior in college. What do I do with my life? Go to class, talk to 5-10 acquaintances I’ve made in my major, study, do homework, workout, play golf, surf the Internet, masturbate. Oh yeah – let’s talk about that for just a second. I’ve had 2 girlfriends in my life. I met both at the old job I used to work at in high school/early college. No lack of sexual activity. But the second one, I screwed up and as our paths became more difficult to align, she left me. It was completely my fault. I truly loved her and still do but we have not talked now in almost a year. I have not met any girls (or guys for that matter) in college who I’ve developed a relationship with deeper than just acquaintance level. So I masturbate a lot and have developed quite the porn addiction, which I know is very unhealthy but I just can’t stop. I’ve tried to meet girls but it takes too much effort and time and it’s too late for me in college. And it seems like a lot of people I know here just have acquaintances themselves. It’s impossible to truly bond with people now. If you built a social group early on in college, that lasts…if you didn’t, well, you’re pretty lonely then. That’s me. I’m proud of the acquaintances I’ve made in my major and clubs, but they aren’t true “friends” on a deep level. I’ve tried to make it happen but it just doesn’t happen.

In the grand scheme of things, I guess I’m OK. I have a nice academic record and I care about a lot of important things in the world and feel decent about my potential in the future job market and career world. But inside, I’m hollow and miserable, and I think it’s because I failed socially and never bonded with people. I’m 23. I wish I could go back and do things differently because I can’t ever get those years back. Teenage years and early 20s are the times to have those experiences…take risks, be a little bad, within reason. Once you’re older, you really have to just be dedicated to your career and your family, if you have one; otherwise, you’re a loser and can do real harm to your standing.

It eats me up inside that I missed out on some of those things and I don’t know what to do. I don’t smile or laugh much anymore. Walking depression is the norm. I feel like I have to get some of those experiences out of my system in order to move on, but I can’t make that happen now. Any advice for someone like me?",16Sep2019,1

44,"This might seem silly or insignificant but my (m/23) sister (f/12) is autistic and struggles expressing emotion, those of you familiar with the condition will understand. We've always gotten along well but she becomes instantly shy and loses all self confidence in most verbal communication and particularly in social situations.

Today I took her for a horse riding lesson, the lesson went well overall and she got a small rosette for her progress, I'd been cheering her on from the sidelines and whatnot, and then something truly lovely happened

She got off the horse, came through the gate and gave me a big hug, and said ""I'm really glad you're here with me today""

For the first time in her whole life, with no prompting, no awkwardness or shyness, she hugged me because she wanted to.  in front of the instructor without being fazed at all, and honestly while I'm emotional just thinking about it I'm so proud of her, and wanted to have a proud big brother moment, so here I am!",16Sep2019,1258
45,"Not a day goes by when you don't read about people doing something really stupid or really controversial that wouldn't have happened without social media. News are full of talk about cyberbullying, community guidelines, revenge porn, shitstorms, privacy concerns, public figures saying dumb shit and provoking a scandal, private people oversharing and embarrassing themselves.

And it made me wonder if that's going to calm down in the next few decades. The first iPhone came out only 12 years ago, and in that short time smartphones have had a huge impact on how we interact with things and people. I sometimes think society in general hasn't quite figured out how to deal with it in an appropriate way, and as a result we see dumb stories like ""parents share pictures of their toddler's feces on facebook"" - among more serious stuff - all the time.",16Sep2019,3

My friends don't care — let's be real, no one probably will — and the ""close friends"" that I have...

48,"No one cares but I'm doing this for me. Context is that I just moved to Texas for college not knowing anyone or anything.

I tweet almost constantly about my depression in a way that's not constructive to me or anyone else

I don't take out the trash because I don't know where the dumpster is and I don't want to seem dumb for asking

I eat one meal a day and it's not balanced

I have to avoid doing fun activities because afterwards I'll crash and be really depressed

Sometimes I just stop caring about anything including other people and seem like a total dick

I don't sleep every night and I end up confused, exhausted and unable to sleep when I actually need to

I used to like video games but now I can't bring myself to play them. Same goes for books so when I have free time I usually just stay in bed with the lights off

I impulse buy way too much queso but end up throwing most of it away because it makes me nauseous

I sometimes go days without shaving or showering

When I get a package I don't pick it up for days because that would require talking to people

I make commitments I can't possibly keep and then when I back out I feel terrible

I've been off my meds for several weeks but I won't refill my prescriptions bc I don't know how and I'm poor

I'm supposed to be getting counseling but when I'm doing okay I don't need it and when I'm doing bad I don't want it

I'm either wildly unattractive and out of shape, or have a poor self image and I'm not sure which is worse

I've constructed elaborate lies to my family about my counseling experiences and how much my meds are helping

I fantasize about death constantly to the point where whenever I make a tiny mistake my internal monologue is just ""kill myself"" over and over again

I get paranoid over the tiniest things like today I carried a speaker by myself for my job while a woman held the door for me and ever since I've been worried that she hates me for being toxic

I don't get sexually aroused anymore which I guess isn't a big deal in the grand scheme of things

I've kind of built my personality around my mental illnesses so talking to me is probably a chore

I like writing but sometimes I'll get frustrated and destroy all the stuff I wrote and make it unrecoverable so there's no point because I can't even protect my work from myself

Sometimes I stop walking in the middle of the street for no reason

I listen to ASMR which is like the worst one

56,"Fun fact, the ""founder"" of Asperger's(a disorder on the autism ""spectrum"") first labeled and coined the syndrome as ""autistic psychopathy"". His stance was that people with asperger's couldn't grasp nonverbal communication(i.e facial expressions and body language), and lacked the ability to understand others feelings through either sympathy or empathy. 
The nations insistence, on labeling autism as a  ""spectrum"" is misguided and only done to further acceptance and inclusion. This would be wonderful, if the acceptance and inclusion was actually genuine in any respect. I'm not saying people with autism are evil or less than anyone else, I'm saying there is a clear and irrefutable connection to autism in its forms and extreme violent outbursts.  I challenge you to show me a school shooter, club shooter, hotel shooter, church shooter, movie theater shooter, a serial killer; all mass murderers and terrorists by any definition, who didn't have a form of autism. 
Maybe instead of sweeping shit under the rug to make people feel ""normal"" and accepted, we accept the fact that none of us by definition are ""normal"".

59,"I was born from an immigrant family in a country where still there's a lot to do what to general perception of multiculturality. Regardless, I think there's no such thing as a racist country, and whoever works hard and love the country where he's born will always be welcome.

I know I've been lucky, I've met a lot of kind people who never made me feel any different. When I was 19 i got into med school, my goal was to be a biomedical researcher due to my passion for hard work and hard study. There I met Paul, a chill guy who was exactly the same as me: foreign parents, a long personal story starting in another country and ending in a med school, the ambition to work in the field of biomedical research.

I've always had native friends since childhood to high school. Like many other second generation immigrants I feel completely into the culture of the country I was born. I never had people with my same condition as close friends, so it was rather a surprise for me. Me and Paul always had a deep connection: we both started from literally nothing and wanted to get ahead in this world with our own forces; we used to share our childhood memories, and I think that literally no one could understand me as he did.

Once we had a very deep discussion about our personalities, it was a striking surprise how two very different persons could share so many similarities. For those into the subject of personality disorders, I fit into the definition of introvert narcissist: my life is a pendulum between enthusiastic grandiosity and the fear of failure. For one who attended med school it's the best personality disorder to have, it's high functioning and brings great accomplishments. Still sometimes I think that my life is shit because I spend it in a permanent competition, and I just can't get rid of the fear of failure. That's what I said once to Paul, my greatest fear is failing at succeeding in life, and you know that as a narcissist your expectations are pretty high.

One year ago we graduated and this year we got into our residency program. It was such a great satisfaction, we were so much proud of each other. We spent the last month making projects for our future, we wanted to follow our dream of making research, we were full of enthusiasm and just wanted to show everyone what we were worth.

Yersterday Paul died in a car crash. Such a young and talented person, he worked hard for his accomplishments and will never reap the benefits, he will never see his dreams come true. 

Whoever lost a close friend knows that it's so hard to find a reason. Yesterday was the worst day in my life, there's no word to describe such an unimaginable suffering. I have to thank Paul for everything he did to me, for the amazing experience of sharing such a deep connection with a person.

But there's more. I'm not afraid anymore, because  now he's with me. His strenghts are my strenghts, and he will never leave me alone. I thank him so much for helping me understanding and improving myself, now I have to go ahead, accomplish our dreams and do that for him. That's why I dont fear failure anymore, because I'll do it for you. Thank you so much, I love you my brother.",16Sep2019,2
60,"A few years ago I had a bit of a revelation that I would like to share. I was in high school and I looked around at some of the people who were set for success in my class and thought “how do they always know what to do?” I always assumed it was because they were smart. Then it dawned on me. These people don’t always know what to do, they just ask the questions they need to. It sounds minor, but it’s important. Smart and successful people don’t just know what to do all of the time. They find the people the need to and ask the right questions.

The takeaway is this: ask your questions. If you are in class and you aren’t sure of something but you think it’s dumb, raise your hand and ask, or at the very least catch the professor after class and ask your question. It doesn’t matter if people think you’re stupid. You are bettering yourself by getting the information that you need and in turn making yourself smarter.

• The 7 countries plan. Former 4 star army general Wesley Clark said that after 9/11 he was told about a plan to invade 7 countries in 5 years. [Here's video of him talking about this.](https://youtu.be/SXS3vW47mOE)
 
• The Mineta testimony. Norman Mineta, who was Secratary of Transportation at the time, gave a very interesting testimony in front of the 9/11 commission, although they didn't put it in their report for some reason. The testimony is fascinating and I won't try to summarize it, [I would recommend watching it.](https://youtu.be/bDfdOwt2v3Y)
 
• Operation Northwoods was a false flag plot that the DoD and Chiefs of Staff proposed in 1962. They planned on shooting down a plane full of American citizens so that they could blame it on Cuba as an excuse to start a war. The plan was vetoed by John F. Kennedy. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods)
 
• Another interesting precedent is the first gulf war. One of the major reasons for invading was the Nayirah testimony. A girl named Nayirah testified that the Iraqis had committed atrocities against the Kuwaiti people. She alleged that the soldiers had ransacked a hospital and ""taken babies out of incubators"". George H.W. Bush repeated this story at least ten times in his speeches, and it was almost certainly the biggest reason that so much of the public thought war in Iraq was necessary. It later turned out that Nayirah's testimony was a lie. She had been hiding her identity as the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to the U.S. and the whole testimony was organized by a PR firm.

I've spent years researching what happened, and honestly the [official story](https://youtu.be/hgrunnLcG9Q) seems more ridiculous to me than the alternatives.

If anyone wants to research further, I would highly recommend [this documentary,](https://youtu.be/dWUzfJGmt5U5D) it's about 5 hours long but it is obviously very thorough, it goes through all the evidence and asks a lot of important questions. It doesn't draw too much of a conclusion about what did happen, but I think it does a really good job of disproving the official story.

As for alternative theories, I think [this video gives the best explanation of what actually happened.](https://youtu.be/RAAztWC5sT8) I was blown away when I saw it, I already knew a lot of the info but there were pieces of the puzzle I didn't know, and it's amazing to see it all presented in an hour.

I highly recommend [James Corbett,](https://CorbettReport.com) he's done a lot of great work about 9/11 and he's also covered tons of other subjects which are definitely worth checking out. He's a great researcher and he always cites his sources, lots of links to primary documents and all that good stuff. His [9/11 Suspects](https://www.corbettreport.com/suspects/) piece is fantastic, and he's also made [Follow The Money,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3xgjxJwedA) [Ptech and 9/11](https://www.corbettreport.com/ptech-and-the-9-11-software/) and [War Games.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3noExmsCRyg)

70,"I was going to distract myself, continue to use my internet (and fail my diet later as a consequence) but I decided to just do it. Why different this time? As a result of consuming positive material yesterday night and going over my goals/ideas, my spirit was higher and I was more alive and I was more in line with my goals.

So even though I was tired (accompanied my father to the hospital, not dead tired) and I got pissed off earlier, I drove to my usual place where I can eat what I think I should eat. Luckily it tasted better than I expected. Maybe it was because I ordered rare or maybe it was because they restocked their meat reserve recently. I ate 400g, which is pretty alright. I could have eaten more comfortably but I was afraid of disliking the meat so I left. Rn after 1 hour, I feel great, which is the opposite of my experience when eating any other kind of food. I feel light or non-fatigued as if I didn't even eat. Then visited my old barber, he seemed happy to see an old customer. But I left because there was someone in life. I didn't feel pissed off or anything because of inconvenience, which is great. Then I went and got some information from a butcher and bought 1.5 weeks worth of liver. Then got myself a white board to write whatever I want to write. Drove back to home. Now I think I'll walk to another barber, the one I dislike. This day can become horrible later depending on what I do.

In short, small wins here: 1. avoiding procrastination/distraction 2. good diet 3. self care.",16Sep2019,1
72,"So, long story short, someone pulled out in front of me 3 weeks ago today in a heavy rain storm.  Fortunately, neither the other driver nor myself were injured at all.  I am grateful for that.  However, my old car, a car I loved, was totaled, mainly due to it's age, and the amount of damage it sustained at only 35 miles per hour of speed.

I am already in a new-ish car, which is nice, and is also older (most importantly, paid for!), but it's nice, and I'm satisfied to have it.  However, I'm very anxious driving.  Like, a nervous mess the whole short commute I have.  I just don't have the confidence driving right now.  I have driven a lot in the 3 weeks since the wreck, in major metro areas like Atlanta and Birmingham (where I live, and the crash happened).  

Is there some period of time that needs to pass, that everyone feels, before feeling better behind the wheel, or is this my already high anxiety level reaching some kind of new levels?

FYI, never had a moving vehicle accident in my 28 years of driving. Bumped a park car or two, and had that happen to me too, but this one was while cars were in motion. It's stuck in my memory, and makes driving the same roads every day a much more miserable experience.  Thanks for your thoughts.",16Sep2019,4

Im 20 years old and in the past few years my view of the world has changed dramatically, like one would expect. After i questioned my life ive come to the realization that i am a nihilist and all i really care about is my own happiness. In of itself i do not think this is bad, as i focuse on what makes me happy and try to live my life to its fullest.

The downside of all of this is, that the only thing that brings joy to my life is my girlfriend. I can not really find pleasure in anything I do. When i think about it, everything I do is for her. My job is just there to earn money, so i can someday finance my life with her. Everything i do feels like it is just a way to bridge the time untill I see her again.

I feel like my life is a joke and I do not want to imagine what I would do if i were to ever lose her somehow. My view on the world feels very crooked and i am helpless.

75,"I've been out every weekend for months now and it sucks. I've been saying for over a month I'll take a break but then I end up out again the next weekend. I don't really get addicted to things, but I'm sure everyone says that. I don't even like drinking or smoking, and I can go months without even thinking about drugs. I'm addicted to the attention I get, and the ego boost.

I don't have many friends, I didn't talk to many people at school and only really have one friend left from there. I was fat and ugly and awkward, I didn't get much attention. I've only recently started going to clubs and it lines up with also losing a lot of weight. When I go out now everyone loves me, guys and girls give me lots of attention and compliments. I'm sure most people have had that experience but I haven't until now. Now when I think of going to bed alone again on a Friday or Saturday night instead of being out I feel this hollow feeling. It's all I look forward to all week.

I try to be more sociable sober but I just can't. I'm still just shy and quiet and feel that I come across as cold. I don't make deep connections with people and I've googled and googled and tried to change but nothing helps. I've tried meeting people online but no one really wants to talk to me and I just feel ulgy again. I don't like to bother people and chats usually fade out. Drugs and alcohol just fix the problem straight away but I don't want to rely on them.

I've probably done permanent damage to my brain with the amount of ecstasy I've had. Whenever I drink I feel sick, my dad died of liver cancer and I don't want to do the same. I don't sleep for 48 hours some weekends, I have no savings and have to regularly skip out on bills. I started selling drugs at one point just to stay ahead but I blew all the money I made on more nights out. I was going to the gym 5 days a week and now I've completely stopped. I'll normally go to work feeling crap on Monday and call in sick Tuesday becuase my body hasn't properly recovered. It sucks but it almost seems worth all the trouble just to be liked.

And l am not sure if you even use that number.  I remember when we were fourteen, sipping Appy and pretending like it was beer, we promised each other, we'd get drunk together. Today, I am drunk as I write this, and I do not see a familiar face.  We have come a long way from a gigabyte of monthly data to a gigabyte every day. And still, we do not have enough time to call each other on Skype. Our conversations happened more when call rates were fifty paise for a minute. Where did we go wrong?  There was a time when l thought this will go on, and we will go somewhere and attend a rock concert together when we are 30s. Last week,I went to a concert and none of my friends could mouth the lyrics like you did. Which concert we'll attend anyway, now that Chester is no longer here.

I listen to old tracks on low volume and close my eyes, and I find myself sitting on old classroom desk where we scribbled patterns with our compasses and dividers out of our new geometry boxes. I still have one of that box with me, kept somewhere in my wardrobe. It has memories kept neatly between the rulers and erasers.  Remember that girl? You never told her how you felt. Now she is five time zones and thousands of miles away. Probably dating someone both of us do not know. But, it's okay, I know you must've found someone else anyway.

83,"I don't know, I've always had bits of depression in my life but now it feels like I'm nearing my end. 

 Last month I left a woman I deeply loved because she had insecurity issues that strained our relationship, she would always try and fight or accuse me of things and bring up old problems for no reason other than projecting her self made insecurities. I left her after she tried bluffing a break up to try and get her way and moved out of the apartment into my grandma's. After barely two weeks of that I decided to finally chase a dream of mine I've had for years, leave the desert and move up to northern Cali where it's green.

 Well I did it. I packed my truck and loaded my motorcycle and I'm here. The trees are beautiful and all the lakes and rivers are to die for. Ufortunetly getting a place as a 21yo is harder than I thought, I've been sleeping in my truck. I dont mind the urban camping too much but when I think deep down. I'm torn that I'm not with her any more even though I know she was bad for me, I just wish sue would have listened to me and shut her trap and just relaxed and let us love one another.

 So now, I wake up and think. Why. Why go so postmates. Why try and get a pad. Why go and workout (I've been sleeping in my gyms parking lot and showering here) why eat. I'm just thinking that I should get a life insurance policy, buy a kayak how I always wanted to and have an ""accident"" a couple months from now so I can leave something for my family.

 I feel like I've squeezed all the juice I can out of life's lemon. It's my time now.",16Sep2019,2
84,"Let me start by saying I've never been out of work, or willing to pay my rent or taxes etc. I'm a 28M who's seemingly having an early midlife crisis. I have no direction, I currently feel and have told many people I have no desire continuing to work all possible hours of my day to pay off a mortgage that won't be paid until I'm nearly ready to retire and die. When I told my dad this he flipped it right around on me taking it like a personal insult, making out that I'm implying all he has ever worked for is for nothing. (I do get that and maybe should have put it across in a nicer fashion).

Issue is I'm struggling with anxiety and depression now, not enjoying my work and it's making it worse knowing how hard it is to get on the property ladder and also resigning myself to the fact it also means a lifetime of debt and struggle. I've lost all my way in life and literally don't know what to do anymore. Living at home at my age is probably making it all worse, having no ambition is making it worse...I feel trapped in an endless loop. My parents think I've lost the plot and now I'm starting to feel that way. 

Ultimately if it wasnt so frowned upon I'd like to live a more frugal life in say a trailer on some land. Growing my own food and keeping livestock. Working shorter hours to pay for necessities etc, just a less consumer driven, more old style life. Everytime I try to convey this to people they look at me like I'm a crackpot. I just cannot get my head around the fact that people are happy to just go with the flow about what they're told is ""right"".",16Sep2019,15

87,"I've always been slightly androgenous my whole life and I'm also very open minded about doing certain things that society at large has deemed girly (like painting your nails or whatever). I'm also very comfortable around girls and I've been in a relationship. Although I do these so called girly things, I also do many so called manly things like football and racing and stuff. 

I haven't been in a relationship in a long, long time and a lot of guys ask me (assume) if I'm gay cuz I haven't dated in such a long time. I think a lot of the times people do jump to this conclusion that I'm gay is because I haven't had a girlfriend in a long time. There was even a guy who once suggested that I try out being gay for a while and see if I'm actually not. Guys also think I'm gay cuz I sometimes wear or style things that aren't normal guy clothes but I've never rocked something as drastic as heels or a dress. I've also been accused of being gay cuz I haven't lost my virginity yet. 

Some girls have even thought I was gay cuz I was open to discuss things such as  K-pop or fashion with them. This is really what kinda scares me. Even if a guy thinks I'm gay they can fuck off with their toxic masculine bullshit, but if girls think I'm gay too it's not gonna be good. What if I'm interested in a girl and they think I'm gay? It makes me feel like I'll be forever alone.

It's just annoying that I keep being stereotyped. Sometimes I wish I was gay so that I wouldn't be so misunderstood. It sucks and it makes me feel sad about being myself.",16Sep2019,2
88,"I am alone, and I feel lonely.

Today I’m writing a poem for myself.
Not for my ego, not for my fantasies, not my self-esteem. Not for my depression.
Today I’m writing for the questions in my head, and the fear in my heart. I’m writing because I’m confused.

Today I’m writing a poem for myself, because today I feel truly alone. I don’t know how else to express that. Listening to All Time Low, a great band. I don’t know what else to do or say.

I feel really alone and lonely today.
I used to think they were different, but right now it really feels like they’re just fancier wordings of each other. I really doubt they’re all that different today. Because in the end, I’m the one who feels lost. Who feels spaced out, who feels fallen out of conversations and friendships. Who feels alone. And honestly, I’m so used to overthinking that at this point, I could pinpoint the exact second where my depression takes over. Or is about to. But again, no matter what, no matter what mental illness I have... I’m the one without friends. Not depression, not my anxiety. I feel like a genius, a sociopath each time I refer to my loneliness as having ‘no friends’ mainly because... I have only one. And she isn’t always there, or always avaliable. I can’t use her as my punching bag, or a pillow to scream on. She’s another person just like me. And sometimes, especially today, right this second; I feel like one therapy session a week isn’t enough. Then I remember I’m almost incapable of managing time. Blame it on depression, mental health, sickness, a bad day... It doesn’t matter. Because nothing today will change the fact that no matter what I do, there will always be a side of me that isn’t asking for a free and sound mental health, but just somebody else going through something different but similar at the same time. And it’s 00:26 today. Just again, I’m alone, I’m lonely. It will be 1 AM soon, and it will officially announce the beginning of a new day that others might consider the beginning of a new life. Here I will lie, doing nothing different at all. I will tell myself, you KNOW these are all the plays of your depression. All just a small toy for it to play with and toss away, yet it doesn’t feel like it anymore. I don’t feel like I can blame every single problem of mine on depression, or keep telling myself that it’s depression that makes me write these. It’s not possible. It’s not possible for me to have depression control my life, or depression having me control itself and use me as it’s pawn all the time. It’s just not possible. So I’m thinking, maybe it’s not that. Maybe it’s not that at all. It is possible that I just feel lonely, and even if I’m not eager to bite somebody’s ear off anymore, I still feel like I need romance. New friends, new adventures, new craziness’. None of those seem to have emerged yet, and I have to remind myself, now, of all times, that I can’t keep putting the blame on literally anything else all the time. I miss, no, I crave the touch of somebody else despite it not being romantic. I CRAVE attention. I crave love, friendship, talks, arguments: anything at all. I am way too tired of the things I put myself through through fantasies; fantasies that could always become true. Now, I feel like fantasy isn’t even the right word, since all these people have all these ideas and animations in their heads that have nothing to do with impossibilities. Only things that seem so far, but aren’t even out of reach. I’m so tired of being that person. I’m just so tired.

When people say “why don’t you eat?” She just chuckles and smiles “noooo stop iiiit” like she enjoys the attention. Honestly, I do not judge her. I am very empathetic and I do understand a lot of her struggles and problems and I feel for her. But it’s not easy for me either. We are graduating this year which means that every grade counts.

You see, this woman gave me something I had never felt before, even though I didn't have a physical body to accompany me, I had her. I understand the majority of people think long distance relationships are a bad idea, crazy, etc. I won't ever go back to it (to the best of my ability, those things called emotions could change that however). With her it was something else and when it all came crashing down (I am to blame, ultimately for that, I had issues with jealously which eventually led her to split us up). We continued our life as friends, for the first few months it was nothing to enjoy, very tense, very thin ice. I suppressed my emotions for her and instead tried to just help her and make her feel better about her life. After another year or so I spiraled out, and throughout this time, and lying to her about deleting her photos, frequently masturbating to her, I hid my lust and desire for her. 

She was very attractive, great body, and a great mind. Intelligent and funny. I knew she would have no trouble moving on, this of course made me jealous but instead of being angry, it turned into, I guess a fetish, you could call it. The thought of her being fucked by other guys (and I think a girl aswell) turned me on harder than ever before. I became uneasy with this, and as more time went on I began telling her that her stories or hot, etc. I never mentioned that I would masturbate while we texted but I did. Eventually I confessed this, I guess in the inevitable hope she would record herself and whoever she was fucking and send it to me, this never happened lol. Instead we just stopped talking all together and I made new socials. I'm writing this because I logged into my old account to see she had removed me. This is okay, I hope wherever she is and whatever she's doing, she is happy. 

I would never wish her any harm, I truly just never stopped loving her. I'm sorry for those who think i'm disturbed or a freak, I know, and I am not ashamed of what I have done / continue to do. Frankly, I don't know if I'll ever delete her pictures (not all are nudes I have all her selfies etc saved.)

Trying to think of words to describe myself, initially I was scared, trying to find the most appealing aspect of my dulled personality. Now eventually I found my footing and decided to look into my interviewers eye with stone cold showmanship. I wanted my words to mean something, I didn't simply speak, I selected. She did however get me with a trick question. ""What would you do if you noticed x went missing"" (sorry for being vague, I fear the most someone confronting me on my issues, someone I know, while it's unlikely I'm just crossing my Ts and dotting my Is) again, ""what would you do if you noticed x went missing"" my stupid fucking self, instead of ""call you"" I said my grand plan. It's okay, I don't believe it'll affect wether I get the job.

Anyways, Good bye.",16Sep2019,1

109,"I have been depressed all of my life and I think one of the reasons why (or the main reason) is because I have severe Generalized Anxiety Disorder. It has always been extremely difficult for me to feel comfortable in social situations. I remember feeling so defeated, hopeless and scared ever since I started school because of that. So that’s why I think I’ve become generally sad all the time.

I absolutely hate feeling like nothing will get better. I used to beat myself up over it and cry almost daily ;however, I have always sort of loved and obsessed over it, in a way. Since I was a kid, I loved nothing more than to be alone and just think of such tragic things. I loved to fantasize about suicide, death, sadness, harm, loss...etc. In all honesty, nothings really changed to this day. I’m always thinking of these things and drawing art with those themes. There’s a 95% chance I only really like stories, movies, music, writing, art...etc that is depressing. When I find myself intrigued by these things I cannot begin to describe the pleasure I derive from them. It’s like I’m consumed by these feelings-like I’m imprisoned by them. It’s almost as if it’s what fuels me (not to sound weird). At the same time, they’re scary and I know they’re bad thoughts that I would never actually wish on anyone. It gets very lonely knowing I have never met anyone personally that feels the same.

Do you think I have an unhealthy obsession with depression?",16Sep2019,2
110,Poorly worded so let me expand. Do you guys think that you can still be in love with someone up until meeting someone new? Or do you think that you have to get over past relationships first before truly being able to fall in love with someone else?,16Sep2019,1

113,"I’m so sad and lonely and have literally no one to talk to. I just can’t be bothered with it any more. What’s the point. 

Every one who was ever supposed to care for me just didn’t. The only time I was ever happy was when I was put into a foster home. And the badgers shave me back. I just want someone to give a fuck about me. The way I care about them. But they can’t, because they don’t know how much I care. Because a lifetime of physical an physiological abuse has rendered me incapable or having anything but rage and ambivalence. What use am I to any one. I can’t show them love or kindness, all I can do is neutral and angry. 

What the point of living like this.",16Sep2019,7
114,"I'm not trying to be edgy or a vampire. Don't get me wrong, it was still uncomfortable, but I quite enjoyed watching the blood cover the middle of my torso and splash down onto the wet shower floor. 

I got out of the shower briefly before I washed it all off because I wanted to see what it looked like in the mouth area and suffice to say, I looked like a zombie. 

Not sure if this is the right place for this, just had to put it somewhere.",16Sep2019,13

116,"Watched my parent die in front of my eyes?   I was told that I was having a pity party and to get over myself when I finally told an aunt that I missed my dead mom.

Dad left us for his mistress of the week and let the power and water go out?  Turns out it was my fault for not being a stronger, tougher big sibling.  

A few relatives took us in?  I found out a few months ago that an aunt approached them in private and suggested that they drop us, so we can suffer the consequences of choosing to live with our dad instead of her.  Never mind that the youngest is still a kid.  She was still angry at me.

Managed to be at the top of my class and graduate with two degrees at once?  A family member approached me as we were taking pictures to tell me that I would never get a job.  Their mom later told me that I was weak, and that I would never get as far in life as my more ambitious younger sibling. 

Go to a few therapists?  Got told that Im confusing, and that I need to be more clear about what I need before the can help me.  

Tried to reach out to friends?  The conclusion was always that its my fault Im depressed.

Went to a subreddit for one last attempt at help?  Got called a narcissist who was making themself a burden to other people.  

Tried to get awesome grades, take up extracurricular activities, join clubs, engage with friends, hone a hobby (even opened an online store), and do all the other neat, productive things people suggest doing when you say your depressed?

117,"I don’t have many plans for the future. I’ve always felt that I wouldn’t succeed in the traditional way. Not that I couldn’t, or that I didn’t want to, simply that the ultimate result would be that I wouldn’t. And lo, as I believe, so I manifest. I’m majoring in a social science that does not link to real world jobs particularly well

How do I navigate the world once I leave university? I have the privilege of being debt free, for which I feel infinitely grateful/relieved. Do I try to find a random job? Do I go off the grid? I could do most anything. So far all I know is that I like to dance and party... otherwise I don’t know much about myself",16Sep2019,1
118,"My mind has become absolutely scrambled, my finals are fast approaching and I’ve just given up and let go for some reason. The motivation then once drove me disintegrated along with my dying passion to learn and enjoy life. My ability to handle my stresses and worries have became worse over the last few months, and life honestly feels like an endless cycle of torture where I have to get up at 5 in the morning everyday and drag myself to that hell hole I call a high school for 9 hours a day. I go to bed wishing that I had a girlfriend of some sort, at this point I don’t even want her to fulfil any sort of a sexual need of any sort, I actually dream of having someone who understood me, someone I could share my troubles with , and someone I could hold on a rainy day, I even recently began getting recurring nightmares and I’m having trouble sleeping and getting up.  I don’t know about you, but me being a 14 year old I don’t think it’s normal for me to feel this way, most people think i’m obviously too young for a significant other, but at this point I don’t know how long i’m gonna feel this way until something changes. I bet I have friends looking at this right now thinking I’ve completely lost it. But to whoever who actually read through this entire thing, I thank you for your time and appreciate any advice.",16Sep2019,1
119,"I'm not trying to go into a lot of detail but I have a neighbor who is always watching me, creeping, and looking at me. I work from home often and there are a lot of windows, lets just say I catch him staring at me through the windows often; and he somehow thinks its ok to tell me that he was ""watching"" me do things in my yard, in private, when he approaches me. Which he doesnt actually approach me anymore (probably a good idea). I could absolutely go into more creepy detail on why I do consider him to be stalking me, but I do actually think at this point, it classifies as that. So I'm just not going to, for the sake of time.

So, my problem is this. Its been going on for months now, im generally an upfront kind of person, not afraid to speak my mind, BUT this seems to be an especially delicate situation for a number of reasons.

One, hes my neighbor. They own the house next door and arent going anywhere. 
Two, i live on a property with my parents, and they are friends with him and my other neighbors
Three, creeping intensely on your neighbor to the point of ""stalking"" is not something that i think anyone would take lightly......
Four- i actually dont want to sound accusatory, i just want to not be constantly watched. I dont care what people do in their spare time, just as long as its not looking at me
And lastly, im not necessarily scared of this person, just very uncomfortable. Like, i dont want to have to try to keep dodging this person because i know theyre going to stare at me. And im not even thinking they're like a ""bad"" person or anything. They just need to quit looking at me and staring at me and watching me through their window in private, and whatever else. I try not to generally think about this, because it is wholly uncomfortable and not ok.

I'm just asking for advice on what to do, because im not sure what i should do and im not even sure it would be safe or recommended to address it directly with him. Especially if it could possibly turn out that this person IS a bad person. Which i try not to think about, too. To be honest, at this point im not even sure there is really a good way forward, which is why i am asking random internet strangers for advice right now.

thank you for listening :)",16Sep2019,1
121,"I have 1-2 weeks of holidays left before I start college. Atm I spend most of my time watching Anime and playing Video Games! I meet my friends every now and then, but it feels like I'm missing out on so many things others do when they have this much freetime. I could for example have gotten more into exercising instead of only doing some light stuff every 2-3 days. Or I could have tried getting a girlfriend. Didn't do that either though! It's so fucking hard seeing almost everyone around me being in a relationship, it almost makes me want to stop hanging out with people (which is obviously not an option though). 

No idea what the point of this post is exactly, guess I just wanted to get my mind off some stuff. Maybe Anime started to disassemble my brain already, I feel like it doesn't have a good influence on me haha. It probably gives me a wrong outlook on life. It's so enjoyable to watch though, I could easily spend 5-10 hours on it every day if it wasn't for other obligations! It'd probably drive me insane after some time, but hey. At least it'd keep me occupied for some time I guess?",16Sep2019,2
122,"My boyfriend thinks I’m cheating on him and it’s hard for me to convince him that I’m not, nor have I ever in any of my relationships.

He went through my phone (several times) without my permission. And he saw things that rubbed him wrong. But again, I’m not texting, sexting, calling other humans about sex, a possible relationship, about meeting up, or anything. So I’m still curious about what ticked him off.

He recently confessed about tracking my snap chat number accumulation. I’m not sure what kind of math this individual is doing, but he seems to think I racked up a couple thousand snaps In one whole week. I literally stopped talking to people on snap chat when I entered this relationship, so I can’t seem to think who the heck I’m snap chatting that much in a weeks time.

So here I am an innocent individual. But because my boyfriend was slashed and burned in his previous relationship he’s extremely cautious about EVERYTHING I do. He assumes I’m the EX and I’m cheating (because all girls do is cheat). And it’s frustrating to get interrogated about my phone. 

I go out of my way to create an easy phone password (which he 100% knows). I now avoid using my phone around him. 
And I will try my best to keep my phone unlocked and extremely visible. Because my words “I never cheated on you. I don’t cheat. I’ve never cheated on anyone I’ve dated” don’t seem to be of value to him.

He’s a jealous person and at time it’s suffocating. I sucks to call guilty when you’ve nothing. And it suck even more for me to provide evidence and explanation to show him that “hey, I’m not an open book, but I can assure you that I’m NOT straying/strayed off”.",16Sep2019,1
123,"The usage word ""apparently"" has bothered me a moderately for awhile.  People often use it when they mean ""reportedly""; if someone told you something, it's not apparent.  Apparently should be used if you're describing something you inferred.

So when people use the word ""apparently"", I don't usually call them out on it, because I don't care that much, but I do notice it.  So I've been noticing it a lot recently, but a few months ago, not so much.  Two years ago, I remember being annoyed by it a lot.

So yeah, there's my thesis.",16Sep2019,1
