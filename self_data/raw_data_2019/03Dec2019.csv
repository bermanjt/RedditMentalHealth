10,"To put it simply, it has been 6 years since I've had sex. For most of that time, sex wasn't on the forefront of my mind and I was ok without it. 

Yet, for the past month something has changed. I've become, for the lack of a better phrase, uncontrollably horny. The likes of which I haven't felt since I was a teen. I really don't know what to do with myself. It's making relationships with women difficult, as all I'm thinking about is sex. I wish there was a way to easily get rid of this sensation, but I have no idea how.

Me and my ex never did it, and I am still a virgin with a box of unused condoms; but, I have plans for my friend to hook me up with a girl he knows this coming weekend, and I want to know if they will still be effective despite it having a best by date of 12/2019.

14,"Idk today’s a Monday and usually Mondays suck big time, but even though I’m tired, stressed out (finals week), and there’s a whole bunch of shit going wrong with my life, it feels relieving to still be able to feel happy regardless of everything else. Maybe it’s temporary but I’m still thankful.

Anyways I was talking to this friend and we always have really good conversations, and she complimented my wardrobe choices today, then she complimented my height, and then she even complimented my eyes, and it all just felt really good. She just said that it must feel really good to be tall and how girls like that and life must be easy. And then she basically said I’m tall have nice eyes and I should be set, and that was just the most comforting thing a girl has ever told me. I’m pretty sure we’re just friends but it feels extremely nice for someone to compliment you and just highlight your good qualities like that.

And then I went to hangout with my friend and that was pretty cool, bc I had a decent conversation with one of his roommates and it always feels good to meet new people.

And then on the drive back I was just staring into outer space while I was driving and I catch eyes with this girl and I kind of glanced away a little, and then looked back and she says hi, rolls her window down and asks how I’m doing. She was decently cute too, and it was kind of just caught off guard about the whole thing, but I rolled with it and it was funny and cute. We kind of just laughed, I asked her where she was headed, she said she was a something something, and then I said what’s that, and I guess she was heading to football practice. I kind of laughed and said that’s crazy, and there was a pause and that’s when she said have a good night, and think I said you too, and the light turned green. 

That was pretty funny and just interesting more than anything but it still felt good. Idk sometimes I have my bad moments and like go through periods where I’ll just feel worthless and ugly, and this was just a heroic dose of validation, which feels good.

All in all pretty good day, hopefully the week lives up to it.",03Dec2019,1

Okay so Im at C now for 1 year and 2 months now. Friendly people to work with. But not getting the hours I needed. So I went did a 2 week course and 15 weeks later got job S. It’s been about 2 months now and I’m getting regular shifts. 2 or 3 / 15hrs/wk yer I know it’s not much but it’s still decent $$$ for my age. So last week for S I got put on to watch someone do their job because of certain requirements haven’t been meet. So I got 3 weeks to start with Monday to Friday plus a Saturday shift. So as a normal person would do notify job C to update my availability. And guess what I get nothing for 2 whole weeks. Okay what ever. I’ve been tempted to leave it for the past 3 weeks now because I’m not getting what was promised by the business and a lot more issues aswell.

19,"So I've always done pretty well in my classes. When high school started my classes were naturally harder but I was able to maintain my grades, just with some more effort. But this year, my junior year, I've lost any and all motivation to do well whatsoever. The only thing that's gonna be keeping my GPA at a reasonable spot are my easy 100 theatre and broadcasting classes. In my actual classes though, I'm making low 70 averages, and I just got back a 45 on a major test, so that's fun. I just haven't felt motivated to do my homework or study or even pay attention in class sometimes.

I've also kinda lost the ability to read over the past year or so. I look at the words and sentences, but they don't mean anything to me. It took me half an hour to finish reading a single paragraph for a reading in class last week. It's gotten so bad that I had to drop my AP Literature course because I won't be able to get much done, and I have barely even been able to start the reading I'm supposed to do before the class starts.

It's not just academic either. At home I feel no reason to do anything more than the bare minimum. I barely even have fun playing games anymore for some reason, they seem more like a chore to get done than a fun way to wind down. I have a huge backlog and I don't think much progress will be made any time soon.

Even with my friends, it seems like they're just tolerating me, rather than being friends that care about and support me. The only person I feel a connection with is my girlfriend, who is basically the only thing in the world that's keeping me from completely falling apart right now. Even then, I feel like I'm being horrible to her. We normally talk all day every day, but tonight, I didn't bother to respond for 2 hours, only to say to her I didn't feel like talking tonight. I can't imagine the stress and worry I'm putting her through. I just feel like she doesn't deserve someone like me, she deserves someone a LOT better.

I just want this to all be over. I want to feel happy and fulfilled. I act fun and cheerful but I've barely felt happy at all in the past year. I don't know how much longer I can keep up this facade. Thanks for reading, I just needed to get this off my chest.",03Dec2019,1

25,"Hello fellow internet strangers,

This is somewhat of a confession/advice thread so here we go. 

Around the age of 6, someone had exposed me to a porn website. Unfortunately, I was stupid enough back then to click on it and watch some of the videos. I won’t go into specific details, but by the time of 8, I already had... hair everywhere. Obviously my voice hadn’t changed then, but that first stage boosted by quickly.

26,"I was in a toxic relationship for 8 years where he would degrade me as a person based on my weight and when I would try losing weight it would make him mad because in his mind he had to be superior to me I am assuming? Not sure but he was a real dick about it and he knew I was very sensitive over it cuz it was something that I always dealt yes. I left the relationship at my heaviest at 240 pounds and by this time I wasn’t even going out because I felt so gross that people would cringe if they saw me or I would always cover my big arms because I had those dents at the elbows. Anyways I lost 85 pounds and I thought I would feel better but I’m just so self conscious still. Like even more where I debate to even talk to my siblings because I feel so annoying. It’s a constant battle in my mind and it’s like I try my best to be myself but I feel like shit for it cuz I remember my ex would roast me if I was myself just saying I was stupid and just being very mean cuz he always said it was cuz he was mad but his words affected me so much I catch myself just thinking I look so gross or something like I remember going to the gym and just sipping my sweater up to my neck and putting my hold on because I was embarrassed and how my hand was so shaky to get the disinfectant because there was someone next to me. I never felt more alone in my life but I can’t bring myself to anyone because my ex ruined it for me that every time I just think I’m an annoyance to the world and I try to be positive about myself but it’s so hard. Even harder than when I was obese because at least I was able to eat my feelings out but now I’m trying to cope with them and it’s been very hard any advice,?",03Dec2019,1

30,"Around this time last year, I (15f at the time) had sexual relations with this older guy (23m at the time). We started talking on Twitter as we had mutual friends and had been following each other for a while.

He started casually flirting with me. I told him I was 15, to which he said ""honestly i wouldn't care if you were 14 i'd still wanna see you"". That kinda creeped me out so I stopped replying.

A couple weeks go by where I'd been giving minimal responses but he hits me with ""i'm friends with [b-list celebrity that i'm a really big fan of]. continue talking to me and you might be able to meet him one day"". He sent a lot of proof which I could validate (Twitter reply exchanges, the celebrity I liked would comment on his insta posts, etc.). I was still extremely creeped out though. I admit I was fucking stupid but I did then continue to talk to him. He stopped being too forward and things remained pretty friendly for about a month.

One day, he hit me with the ""i'll get you a phone call with [celeb] if you come and strip for me"". So I did. I'm dumb, I know. He came over to mine while my parents were away for a weekend (we only live like an hour drive apart) and I stripped for him while he watched and jerked off.

Honestly, I don't even know the point of this post. I just needed to get that off my chest, I've never told anyone in my life and don't plan to. I feel like it's my fault. I still think about it/him a lot - even a year later. I don't know what to call any of this shit; coercion? Was it sexual harrassment? I don't know.

35,"So I don't know why this happened out of the blue. 

I was in my room doing my math homework on my desk next to my window where sunlight was pouring in. It was literally a normal day for me. At some point I started to feel a bit sad and no, it wasn't for my dying passion and love for math, but it was just literally a random feeling of sadness hitting me out of nowhere.

Even though I don't know why I felt sad at that time I decided to just push it aside and get my work done, because fuck school and I don't want to fucking fail. The thing as well was that the feeling of sadness wasn't unbearable, it was just a small feeling that was there so pushing it aside wasn't a big deal. 

Back to the scene,  I was looking at the work I was doing until I blink and suddenly I was somewhere entirely different. Nothing made me feel dizzy or anything, I just knew that I was in an area that was covered in white, light pink and gold clouds/mist. My mind didn't even try to comprehend where exactly I was at, only that I know this place. That and a panicking feeling came over me instead with thoughts like ""How did I come back? Why did I come back? I don't think it's my time so did I do something bad to end up here?"". I felt like I was in trouble for some reason if I was just *back* without any explanation. At that moment I felt like I knew that there was being that had some type of authority over me and I was freaking out because I didn't want to be on their bad side.

As I panicked a bit the authority figure appeared in front of me and all the thoughts I had came to silence as I waited for the being to tell what happened and why I'm back. I can't remember any detail of the figure at all, only that it kind of looked tired and annoyed when it assured me that I didn't do anything wrong, just that my *friends* wanted to check up on me. When it moved aside, I saw two figures standing a couple of feet behind him and I remember that one was male and the other was female.

Without a second thought I instantly became so happy I ran towards them yelling their names, and they had their arms open ready for me to dive in and hug them. Now I don't actually know these people in reality and if you were to ask me who are they while showing a picture of them I know my response would be ""I have no fucking idea"". What was weird was that I didn't feel like they were strangers, I felt like I knew these people and they have been with me my whole life and that I have been with them in theirs. I felt like they were a part of me and were my best friends, and that they know the real me. Which is strange, because in life I have best friends who have known me as a kid growing up and they know a lot about me considering I'm literally an open book and have nothing really to hide for, which now makes me think why my connection with those two strangers felt stronger than whatever I feel now with my friends is confusing. Anyways, when we all hugged my two friends were talking almost all at once, asking questions like ""\_\_\_ how have you been?!"", ""It's been a while!"", ""I miss you, I want you to come back sooner!, or ""Are you feeling okay right now?!"".

At that moment my heart was filled with so much joy that I felt it spread throughout my whole being and I instantly felt like I was at peace, that I was home. I answered back, but I don't recall what I said but do know we chatted for a bit, happy to have all three of us back together. Only a bit later did the authority figure come back and had informed us that I had to go. I felt immediate fright and was trying to tell them to no, that I didn't want to and that I just wanted to stay here. They looked at me with pity and said ""You know I can't do that."".

I didn't want to cause anymore trouble than I thought  I was doing so I accepted it and decided to give in. As I was being sent back I was staring at my friends who had sad smiles on their faces and I felt like I knew they would always be with me and to not worry anymore.

As I starred at them for a minute I blinked and I was starring at my math homework again. It took me a couple of minutes for my conscious to realize that I was in my room, and once it registered that my immediate thoughts were ""Please wait, I don't think I can do this."" and ""I want to go back, I don't want to be here anymore, I miss them"". When those thoughts came in I also experienced a horrible wash of over-boarding sadness. I kid you not I felt like I was fucking depressed that my whole chest was hurting from so much pain. I let myself just sit on my chair for hours feeling nothing but sad that I didn't even want to get up nor finish my homework.

I then remembered my friends and their names, but my friends appearances became blurry in my head except for me calling out their names. My mind told me to write down their names to not forget them, but the other part of my mind told myself that I wouldn't forget because they were very important to me.

A couple of days later my dumbass forgot their names, but I did not forget the experience of whatever I went through. 

I know I didn't make all of this up because yes, even if I do doze off occasionally I would know by the end of my daze that I had made it up. Even if it was a deep daze I know in reality that I had fabricated it, that's why this one makes no sense to me because my mind doesn't registered why it would make this up. I had felt deep sadness before, a bit of depression, even small panic attacks and all, but my mind wouldn't ever even think to make any fabricated memory to reassure myself that everything is okay, so I find it weird that the one time I randomly feel a bit sad some huge shit like this happens.

It's weird because now sometimes I would be going on with my day and my mind would randomly remember them and I would end up feeling sad so there's that.",03Dec2019,1

But no. The logistics are impossible no matter what and my biggest fear is a failed attempt, especially if it makes it more difficult to try again.

Guessing I should take some kind of antiemetic too to be sure but that wouldn't be too hard to figure out either. And the cases it gave didn't involve one.

60,"I got married young. I was 18 or 19 when I married my now ex wife. Don't know why we did it; I think we both agreed we were both just too enamored in the romantic idea of marriage. We broke up after being together for a year and a half, married for a year. For the next 6-8 months I went into a massive downward spiral of alcohol and substance abuse (party drugs almost every day). Eventually I worked my way out of that with the help of a wonderful friend who ended up becoming my girlfriend, and have been together for over three years now.
A few weeks ago my ex called and said she was getting remarried so we needed to finalise our divorce. So today we met up and filled in the paperwork. She told me she had been seeing a psychologist, and had realised that her behaviour towards me was emotionally abusive and toxic. She was a very jealous and possessive woman, and would often gaslight me and made me believe I was going insane at many points. Even after we broke up, as she began spreading rumours that I was physically abusive. Fortunately many people saw through her lies, especially when she told multiple versions of the story with little consistency. For some reason I can't even remember it all, as the time with her is almost a total memory blank much like my early childhood. It has left me with a lot of lingering issues, especially with trusting people and opening up.

But she actually apologised. Hearing her acknowledge that she was abusive and bitter, and then apologising for it was an unreal feeling. I finally felt heard; I felt like I could let go. I still don't truly remember what happened, except for brazen moments, but I'm working that out with a psychologist myself.

64,21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it so idk. Also when I only got a pub job myself without asking for her help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way .  When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley quiet way which confuses me because she gave me a furrowed eyebrows snobby look at me when she first called me over to the appointment which got me down,03Dec2019,1
65,"Hi guys hope you’re all having a good day!

So I got freshers flu at uni on the 4th of Oct (including a productive cough) but the cough has just kept lingering on. I have been to the doctors twice (first time they gave me a ventolin inhaler as they said it’s inflammation, second time they told me to keep going on ventolin but gave me a steroid inhaler to try in case the ventolin doesn’t work). They listened to my chest, checked my oxygen levels etc and also ruled out asthma and cough variant asthma. 

I think I caught a different cold/virus last week (URI) on top of the cough so maybe this is why it’s taking so long. It’s still productive but now my body feels completely exhausted from coughing for 8 weeks (I also have fibromyalgia and ehlers danlos hypermobility type on top of this). I’ve been using steam and a humidifier etc, as well as ventolin, but I don’t know what else to do. I’ve yet to try the steroid inhaler as I wanted to give ventolin a good chance to work, but maybe that will clear it up. Any suggestions would be great!",03Dec2019,1

70,"Holy shit, I have never been more fucking stressed in my entire life. I'm in my final year of university, studying economics and computer science. And jesus, this year has been a clusterfuck so far. 

1. I'm trying to change computer science modules, there was a mistake and technically, I shouldn't have been let onto this module in the first place. It's nearly end of term and I haven't heard anything back. They said I can change and they'll let me know. that was three weeks ago, I emailed the main person I spoke to and they have no idea whats happening. If I cant change modules after all then thats third year gone, I failed that module and I'll have to retake the year or something. I actually don't know what I'm meant to do in that case.
2. I have no idea what I am doing for my economics dissertation, I had an idea, which I thought was decent. I wanted to look at the impact of online personalities acting as sources of infomation on demand and preference decisions. My supervisor hated the idea, and her amazing idea was ""Apples have a taste, and calories"", I'm not shitting you, I recorded the meeting, listened back to it 10 times, and that is literally all she said. 
3. I'm fucking broke, I have fucking 20p in my account after rent and bills. I barely have any food left, thankfully I'm going home in 2 weeks so it wouldn't be that big of a deal. BUT I CANT EVEN AFFORD THE COACH TICKET BACK HOME
4. Everythings fucking breaking, our washing machine just broke for no reason, had some guys in today to look at it, apparently the PCB is fried and we need the whole machine replaced. I'm out of clothes and I'll have to go uni to do laundry, problem is, it costs £5 to do a wash and dry. BUT IM BROKE. I'm just praying that they don't try to pin it on us and take it out of our deposit. 
5. I have a couple end of term exams coming up, which to be honest might not be too bad. One of them is just an online quiz which the guy said is open book. So, I'm thinking that one might not be too bad. but the other one just looks fucked, the teacher is a bitch who probably gets off on giving students anxiety attacks. It would be fine if I had time to study, but with everything going on I just dont have the motivation to do anything. I'm tempted to just not sleep at all, just cram and try to get everything done. 
6. WHY DO ALL THE RESEARCH PAPERS COST SO MUCH! I'm struggling as it is trying to figure out what the fuck i need to do for this fucking dissertation, it doesn't help that everything is behind a fucking paywall. I get it, their work deserves payment, sure. BUT WHY THE ABSOLUTE FUCK IS 10 PAGES WORTH £50. 
7. Next term is going to be even more fucked, if I can change modules, I'll have to do it next term. which means I'm going to have 4 modules + dissertation to do. I can barely manage now with just 2 modules and dissertation. Not only that, but I'm going to need to be cramming all this terms shit so I don't fall behind for final exams. I do get a bigger loan next term, thankfully, so money might not be as big as an issue, but saying that it probably will be. 

I'm even just too exhausted to cry, all I want to do is sleep and watch some netflix, and wash my fucking clothes so I can change out of these week old joggers.",03Dec2019,1
73,"When I was five my dad started cheating on my mom, and I remember my mom taking me out of the house in the middle of night just to see where my dad was and this kept going on for a while, and I also remember hearing and seeing them constantly fight. My dad wasn’t a bad guy, he was very goofy and funny but I now understand that he was not meant to be a father or a husband. After a couple of years of him cheating on my mom, they eventually got divorced. We used to live in this small town in Iowa, where everyone knew each other. So, even though my parents divorced my mom still got broken-hearted every time she saw my dad with another woman. But after two years after their divorce my dad got arrested and was sent prison. I remember very vividly seeing my dad behind the glass window in his bright orange jumpsuit crying as he saw me sobbing. After some months my mom made the decision to move to another town about an hour away from the small town we lived in. In that town (where I currently still live) I had a lot of family on my mom’s side. My mom was renting a house and got a job, and I started elementary school (where I used to get bullied by boys, and singled out by the girls). Everything was okay not good just—okay. But then after a few months of living there, she started dating a guy. My mom used to say they were friends but I was never a naive and dumb child to actually believe they were just friends. Seeing her date another man broke my heart. This man was not a good man. I was 8!at the time when they started dating. He never took the chance and time to get to know me, and he would say very rude things to me and talk crap about my dad to me when my mom wasn’t around. Then he started living with us almost immediately of when they started to date. I remember feeling so lonely at just 8 I had no one, and I started to act out at home and at school and would get in trouble a lot I also started to lie and steal. This caused my mom to yell at me a lot and hit me (not hard though). But thank goodness they eventually broke up, which I assume was because of cheating. Then a few months went by and my mom started going out at night all dressed up and she would tell me she had to go to work but like I said I was never a dumb kid and I knew she was seeing another man. After some time of this going on, I met him. He was nice the first few months of knowing him, then my mom got pregnant with him after 3 months of them dating which is very alarming. So they decided to get to buy a house (which is under only my mom’s day) before my brother was born. Then after he was born that’s when stuff started to happen. My step-dad starting to become very mean and rude towards me especially when my mom wasn’t around. When I started getting older (so around 4th grade) he started to verbally abuse me, he would call me all sorts of ugly names even in front of my mom. He would also yell and scold me in very harsh ways, and almost every time my mom stood back and would not protect or take my side. This affected me in so many way even now. I was always very helpful. I always always did my chores without any type of reward, I took care of my brothers all the type (I have three younger brothers now) while my step-dad was very lazy And didn’t help around the house. Years went by of this going on. I started to stand up and really defend for myself around freshman year since my mom wasn’t going to do it. Last year (junior year) I let out all of emotions and told my mom how bad of a mom she was to me. Is it so bad for me to feel all this resentment towards my mom? I just feel so angry at her for never being there for me especially with all the craziness that happened in my life. All these bad men weren’t only the bad things that happened to me, so much other uglier things had occurred. I just don’t know if I can forgive her and let go of all this hurt.",03Dec2019,1

77,"Hey all. I'm taking this part time course and I met this TA who is teaching a different course at the same time. He is so gorgeous and helpful. I met him last week when I couldn't open the door to the shop (fyi, it's a welding class) and he walked me to the shop and asked me a bunch of questions. It seemed like we really connected. Then this week I see him walking around again and he is totally checking me out. He comes up to me and asks what my name is again. We talk for a while before he has to go back to his own class and this time he's looking deeply into my eyes and getting closer to me. As I'm working he also comes in and asks if the ventilation is working (it obviously is because there isnt a big haze in the shop anymore) and we start chatting again. At the end of his class it seems like he's waiting for something and I ask him if he's done for the day and he says yes. Then he's like see you next week. I'm just wondering if my feelings are valid and if he seems to have a crush on me?

Update! Last welding class of the session...its absolutely freezing and he asks me to come inside and warm up. We start talking more and he keeps telling me that I should take more welding courses. He says as I'm walking past him in the shop: ""you're seriously cute, you know that?"" Awe...

Update part 2: I asked for 1 on 1 advice on a new process and he helps me out. He seems like he's flirting and touching me the whole time. He stands really close (like almost about to pull me in for a kiss close)  when we are talking and looks really deep into my eyes. He says that I'm cute like 3 more times. But when he has to go he lingers a bit and seems like he wants to say more but he doesn't. I'm done my welding course now and I'll be around the university next week. He says see you around as he's leaving. I'm definitely going to stop in and say hey when I'm back here :)",03Dec2019,1

80,"I'm 22 and I'm only now realizing how much my parents' divorce actually may have changed me as a person. I was only 5 or 6 when my parents separated and 8 when it was finalized, so having divorced parents just seemed normal. Even two of my best friends in high school only lived with their moms. My point is, I feel like everyone in my family hates each other and I'm just a mediator. My brother once tried to convince me that I was afraid of our mom just because he hated her. He later even started living with our dad more often. and my mom  has always said ""tell youre father this"" or "" tell youre brother that"" and accuses me of not standing up for her or caring about her just because I didn't want to be her messenger boy anymore. My mom has also told me all the shit that led to the divorce and other bad shit that happened afterwards ""behind the curtain"". Maybe I'm just being selfish but I don't think it's a good idea to unload all your emotional baggage to a kid (she started telling me at 12) constantly who cant process it correctly and feels like shit because he doesn't know what to with that info.

81,"(NSFW for mention of s\*icide)

I think I’ve been doing a lot better in the last 2 years. I think I have a little closure with myself now.

2013ish-2016ish, was having diagnoses thrown around. (Which include GAD, bipolar disorder, and dysthymia) They couldn’t figure me out, so instead of spending more time trying to figure it out, they just put me  on random drugs to see what worked. Ultimately, this made me worse, and left some permanent damage.

2017, attempted s\*icide, kicked out of dream school. Found out I have a rare disorder called selective mutism, and was diagnosed with BPD (though I didn’t agree with the BPD diagnosis) was told I probably have pyroluria. (I still have no clue what it is)

2018, a year later, found an alternative school that I’m still attending, and will end up graduating early even though I started a year behind.

2019, quit therapy about 2 months before this post due to my progress and my mom and I agree I didn’t need it any longer, though I still struggle. Found out there is a possibility I  have OCD, something my 7th grade counselor mentioned  to me once, but my mother didn’t believe her then and doesn’t believe me now. I decided that I ultimately don’t care what she thinks, I still think there is a possibility of me having OCD. My selective mutism causes me to hear a voice yelling, which I still haven’t figured out if I’m the voice or if its something else, and I frequently talk to myself.

Whatever demon talks to me, I think I’ve finally learned to live with. Even if my mom doesn’t believe me, that I hear a voice, that I might have OCD, I stand by my words. I think I’ve learned to say “Fuck it.” when my mom doesn’t agree with me. She might thinks I’m crazy, and maybe I am. But I guess at least I’m alive.",03Dec2019,1

But I’m in desperate need of advice and would at least like to look at things from a different perspective. I recently got out of long term relationship, and for some odd reason, all my socializing skills went along with it. It wasn’t a toxic relationship per se, and to be frank, while we were together, I had plenty of friends (even before i met him) and had no trouble making new ones. But friends drift apart as they inevitably do. And once my relationship ended, so did a lot of my friendships. (Because I moved) I still keep in contact of (exactly) two friends but they live too far from me (one from the city i previously lived in and one in a different country). They’re the only ones i’ve known longer than my last relationship. For some reason i just have trouble forming new relationships. I even have trouble socializing online now unless it’s on a platform that keeps me anonymous (like online games). It’s not like I’m not trying, it’s just every time i do i seem to weird people out (idk if i come off too strong it rubs off as annoying?) and that just discourages me even more...

So i guess my question is, has anyone else gone through something like this? If so, how did you deal with it? And what would be great places to meet new people other than bars and clubs?(i dont particularly enjoy loud places) I also work online so I dont meet a lot of people such as in offices or regular public meet-ups (basically, i dont know where people usually hang out) What should I do to change my situation?

My ex girlfriend and I were in an amazing relationship for about two years but it had to come to an end due to religious and cultural differences. ( her family do not accept me as I am of a different ethnicity to her ) She has also been terribly sad about this and told of her wishes to just be with me but she cannot due to her family restrictions.  During these two years, I had only really talked to this girl so naturally began to speak to my friends a lot less and now shes kind of my only real friend. We talk everyday and we still say I love you to each-other but for now we are just friends with no hope ever of anything further.   


However, everytime I speak with her, I am reminded of the sadness of being rejected by her family and we often speak about a life together even though we know its 100% not going to happen. When I speak with her, its like i'm still wishing that somehow or someway there is a way we can be together. The sadness is so deep and really destroys me mentally, I often become angry at her just to blame something. We still talk all day everyday and most of the time I love speaking to her, but far too often I am reminded of what could've been and it really makes me depressed. I thought that the best thing to do would be to just block her out of my life and try to forget about it but shes my only real friend who I can speak to, If i were to do that then I would have nobody to talk to atall. I do have friends that I could speak to, but sometimes its nice to talk about your day and talk to someone who genuinely cares for you rather than speaking to someone just for the sake of talking. I'd just like to reiterate that I love to speak with her all day everyday but at the same time, it can make me so depressed too. Sorry this post is kind of lame and all over the place.  


The ultimate question is, do I move on with my life and block my best and only friend from every app and messaging service to stop thinking about her and what could've been, or do I continue to speak to her and keep her around in my life because shes my best friend and someone who genuinely cares for me and someone that I love to speak to.",03Dec2019,1
114,"My husband and I recently had our annual physical exams together and got some bad news.  Hubby has very high blood pressure, very high cholesterol, and is diabetic.  He is taking a prescription for his diabetes and has decided to try to lower his BP and cholesterol with changes to his diet.  I told him I will follow whatever diet changes he implements.

The good news is that he has lost 8 lbs and I've lost 12.  In 12 days!  Even through Thanksgiving!  I just wanted to tell SOMEONE since I'm a complete homebody and don't have anyone else to tell.

I'm not sharing with my family out of state.  I'm hoping the weight loss continues (I know it will slow) and I can surprise them during my summer visit!",03Dec2019,1
115,"Maybe this is super weird. I'm 20 years old and I get super hung up on the past few years. I never went to college and dropped out of school. I never really had any friends. I'm a really straight laced and polite person IRL (old people love me) but I sometimes fantasize about what it would have been like to have that crazy youth. I very rarely drink but sometimes I really wanna get incredibly drunk, get high as fuck, and have sex with women who's names I don't even know. So many people at school did that kinda shit, and even more in college. Am I the only one who feels they wasted their youth?",03Dec2019,1
116,I am stuck in a cycle and I’m getting bored. When does the interesting shit start happening. My bones and body is sore after coming off a 2 day bender...and I’m in pain. I am laying in my room listening clatter about in the kitchen and I want her to go away. I want silence I want piece. I’m thinking of leaving before I go insane just not tell anyone and just fuck off for a while. I guess...this...is the best option,03Dec2019,1
117,"let me start by pointing out 2 things:

1. im not here for the ""leave them immediately"" comment, I want real advice
2. keep in mind that everything here is from my point of view

story 1: im a 17y/o male and my brother(B) is 19y/o. I finished school last June and im going to start in the same college as B, this jan. we didn't have the best relationship as kids so I've been trying to get closer to him. we started out just messaging once in a while but recently we've started playing multiplayer games together. at first it was just me and him and everything was good. these days his 2 friends started joining us and all 3 of them keep chatting about stuff in their WhatsApp group while I just sit there listening not knowing what they are saying for 2-3 hours a day. I just felt like the guy who completes the squad (GTA ONLINE) and not actually part of anything. so today I just said fuck it and told them im not playing with them anymore, my brother says im being childish. 

story 2: (this one I kind of tricky because its about my parents and has many ""small"" complaints) okay so in my culture family is everything, most kids live with their parents until they get married, there is no such thing as im leaving. I love(d?) my parents to death, I could spend 5 hours a day talking about silly/small things and feel happy. even if they were going to the most boring place in the world, I would just go to keep them company. one of their biggest problems is that their small talk is just finding things ""wrong"" with me a pointing them out, even if they aren't things that are wrong or I can fix, imagine someone just repeating your flaws over and over and over etc..... there are MANY more problems similar to this   but its 3am so im just gonna list them, 

1. im never right in an argument even if im right. 
2. trying to correct me? don't you have respect? 
3. nothing is enough even if you actually did what I told you. 
4. why can't you remember the 12 things that I told you to do in 10 seconds?
5. small story: mom: you and B have to free up some space in your travel bag so I can put my stuff. B: \* does nothing\* me: \*frees up space enough for all her stuff\* mom: wHy DoNt YoU lIsTeN tO wHaT I tElL yOu?

these are not even all... so for the last couple of months I stopped hanging out with them, other than small talk, my acne is nearly gone, my self confidence is way up and im tackling all me real flaws one by one. when I told my mother about these she said that im just spoiled because we have a good life (money). when I told her its not about the money but the morals, she(and dad) said she won't change and that its my problem. when I told them I don't care about their feelings if they don't care about mine, she cried so I left.

what are your thoughts?",03Dec2019,1
119,"So last night I got anxious for an exam (im in college) and started to feel tightness in my chest i never felt before. It kept me up all night until 4 am and distracted me from studying. Since chest pain was the only symptom and it lasted really long, i dont think it was a heart attack. 

I've had anxiety before but never had physical symptoms besides headaches. 

I eventually went to sleep and woke up alright still thinking about what just happened, i didnt feel any tightness. But, now i start to feel this really mild tightness in my chest that lingered throught the day and it's making me anxious and distracting me from my finals coming up. 

Is this something more serious or related to anxiety? 

PS. I made an appointment on going to the doctor soon, but if I'm not sure if it is super serious or not, if it is i might go to the hospital.",03Dec2019,1
