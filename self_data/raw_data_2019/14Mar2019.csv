0,"Hello. I’m a senior in high school, and about to go to college. Thing is, I have no idea what I want to do. I’ve been accepted to a state school that’s known to be okay, and I’m commuting from home. I get along great with my parents.

But for some reason, I just feel dread about graduating. All my friends have been accepted to schools, and are elated to go. My parents were hugging me and each other when my acceptance letter came in. I just felt apathy. It’s a nice school, bad surrounding town but a nice quiet campus.

I dunno. Should I be excited for college, for the future? I don’t know what else to do, but why do I feel so wrong about it all? ",14Mar2019,2
1,"Maybe I'm speaking too soon but, today I felt absurdly lonely, I generally talk with 1 or 2 people, I do streams and I usually get 2 consistent viewers (not the same people every time), and today I didn't talk to anyone, even tho I tried to talk, the stream was a complete failure, and I bring it up because that's what broke me up today, but the loneliness it's from way before, I constantly feel the need  to get a partner(being in a relationship), even tho I have good friends and I hang out at least once a week, I got rid of many fake friends this year which got me to be more calm because now I don't care if I don't get invited to a hangout, maybe it's the constant blame of my father for not getting a job and not getting (yet) into university, I think it's enough for one post, thank you for reading ",14Mar2019,1
2,"So today I had a final exam for an 8 week course I've been taking that was required for my degree. It was a mock job interview, the build up of all the mock resumes and cover letters we've been doing. I did horrible. I've never had a job interview, never even had a fake job interview, never made a resume, never made a cover letter, I've never even had a job before and the professor knew this.  It was so stressful for me to get this right so my grade didn't suffer. I studied for weeks preparing myself with questions, what I was gonna say, the best I could do. I get there, I have a massive anxiety attack. It took me 30 minutes to calm down and the interview hadn't even started. I ended up getting a low C on the overall interview because I stumbled once and I forgot everything. He told me to take a few deep breathes and it was better to take a second to pause than to fidget so I did, but then told me for doing that he'd have to take points off. We were graded on our appearance but I was told my 2 inch wedges were too tall and I needed to wear flats, my dress was too short at knee-length, needed to be longer. No open-toed shoes either and I just sat there taking it all in. I was told not to take it to heart but it was so difficult not too, I had nothing else to wear and I tried so hard. I've been a mess since it ended and I have no idea what to do. My anxiety is really bad and I've been trying to manage it but I can't control the attacks, I didn't expect to have one and it just did and I feel like it blew the entire thing. ",14Mar2019,7
3,"No one’s ever seemed to want to be around me. Even people I grew up with and hangout with my whole life. They’ve wanted nothing to do with me and I couldn’t understand why. 

To me they were so important. Good friends. Some of my closest and yet they couldn’t careless themselves. I didn’t get this, but now I think I know what it’s about. 

I think I have made relationships way more important and serious than they are, or need to be. And because of that people don’t want to be around me. People are interested in more casual, laidback relationships, where as I made things out to be much more serious. 

I’ve lived this way my whole life and I didn’t know any different. It sucks and kind of hurts. I feel as though I’ve dug a tremendous hole for myself. The people I feel are important want nothing to do with me and now I have to find a new way to live. It’s a daunting task and I don’t know how to do it, but I don’t want to be miserable anymore. I don’t want to be afraid of all these things. I don’t want to be afraid of living. 

What do I do when I don’t know what a relationship is? Where do I begin? How do I go about it? I think I’ve been a fool my whole life. Why haven’t I been able to see that?

I want to hangout with people. I want to have fun and good conversations. I want to have a girlfriend or something like it. You know, I want these things that seem to be so easy and common for everyone else. 

I wonder how obvious it’s been that I’m completely nuts? I wonder if it is, why hasn’t anyone shown me or told me or helped me see that. I’ve been struggling my whole life and I didn’t know there was another way of living. Why wouldn’t someone help? I don’t understand that.

Now I have to figure things out for myself and I feel it can be done. Step by step. Little by little. Not making anything out to be excessively important, whether that’s a relationship with a friend or girlfriend, a job, or anything else. Life should be more casual and carefree, not full of stress and constant worry. I think that is the approach I should take. I wonder if I’ll be able to maintain it. Especially if it is true that no one will help me. 

I wonder how people live. How they feel about certain things. What ‘this’ means to them and how serious or important ‘that’ is to them. I wonder if the understand that we come from different places. That we have lived different lives and are different people. I wonder if they understand that we are on different pages and that what it means to them and what it means to me are in two different worlds, whether the words are similar or not. 

I wonder if there is any way we can meet. If we could see exactly the same just for a moment. And then, not be alone just for that time. I wonder if it’s possible or whether people live without understanding one another their whole lives and are always alone. Never for a moment to be together with another. I wonder if it matters at all or if I’m just crazy and normally people always live like this and don’t have a single problem with it and I’m the only one who’s always alone. ",14Mar2019,1
4,"Before I begin, let me preface this with some background on who I am.

I'm posting here for the first time. My name's Tom, I'm 19 and I'm currently a college freshman in Northeast Pennsylvania.

Also, this is going to be a story on my past two months. Bear with me. Also, I can't TL;DR this. Sorry.

Originally, I thought this year was going to be the best year imaginable. I had begun dating someone in the end of '18, and we seemed like we were gonna hit it off. Our first date was phenomenal. We were ready to take 2019 and make it the best it could be.

Then, everything began to collapse. Firstly, that relationship.

I went to visit her for her Homecoming Dance which she invited me to a long while ago. Even before we began dating. There, my SO (who I consider my best friend always) said they weren't ready to go for a really serious relationship like we had been building up. They were already going through a lot of stress in their life, and this would only make it worse. As much as I did want that to work, I knew it was better to stick with her. We agreed we'd stay as close friends for now. If we were ready later on in life, we'd go for it (assuming either of us didn't find a different partner in the meantime. If either of us did, we said it's ok going after it).

After I came back to campus, things were getting better, at least it seemed. I had begun hanging out with this new group some more, and eventually they brought me in and we became friends. They're great people, and I'm really happy I get to spend time with them almost every day here on campus.

Except, my mind was becoming a problem.

The week I was slated to head down to Homecoming, I ran into what I can only assume was a mental breakdown. Monday night, I got myself sick by being a dunce in regards to food. My stomach was doing its usual agony thing. However, something... else was wrong. A song got trapped in my head, and it wouldn't leave. But this wasn't any normal song. This song plagued me back when I used to play rugby last semester. It was my best weapon to psych me up for the games, but was also the most damaging. Now it's stuck, and I don't have anywhere to go (at least I thought). The next morning, it's still there. But I have no time to get it out. I have office hours for 2 hours, then a class immediately afterwards. The office hours helped me escape the misery, but I was in tears all throughout that class. My notebook has constant references to it as well.

""*The mental breakdown is re-emerging*."" ""*I'm stuck in my own head again*."" ""***I need out soon. What I escaped for 2 hours is back stronger than ever***."" ""*All this because I got myself sick*.""

This breakdown would end up happening again. Except this time, there was a message instead of the song. The message? My friends don't want me around (referring to the new friend group).

February 13-14 (it spilled beyond midnight), 2019. Around 10 o'clock at night. I keep getting visions of my friends trying to beat the shit out of me. Why? I don't know. I keep hearing something around the idea of not wanting me around. They want me out. Then a thought came to mind: *What if the best way to help my friends is to not be there at all?* Sadly, this isn't the first time something similar to this came up. I thought there was something in me pushing away my friends from me. Last time, it was clear.

I was 16, and was going through a depression after my cat had to be put down. I cried myself to sleep at night constantly thinking of the same thing. *They don't want you around anymore. You're too annoying for them. You're better off just leaving them.* Eventually, back then, it got to a point I just wanted to fucking die. I won't go into detail (since I am for the rest of this), but I'll just say the closest I got was pulling out a knife from a drawer. That's it.

This time, I knew I was gonna stick around. It was just a matter of if I'd be lonely. I sent a recap of my day to my story on Snapchat. I'll summarize since I still remember pieces of it.

""*I ended the day needing hugs, but having none... the same thoughts that plagued me 2.5 years ago are back... I can't even distract myself out of them... I focus so much on giving others help, but now I need it.*""

People did reach out. I was in a convo with my mother until 2 a.m. after my cousin sent it to her (thanks Mari).

Fast forward to spring break (March 1-10), and I wanted to talk to my psychologist about it. Understand what the hell happened. I got my answer: an existential crisis happened. We came to the conclusion that my presence was valuable to my friends, but I never always had to do something. I just needed to be there. I'd end up having a few dreams about it, helping one of my new friends through whatever shit was going on by being there and giving her a hug if she ever wanted one.

I have ways to cope now, and they're working alright. This week's been ok. I just need hugs more than ever really. Too bad so few people are comfortable with that. At least there are some.

Thanks for reading this far. You don't have to do anything else if you don't wish. I hope you have a wonderful day, whatever part of the day you're in.",14Mar2019,1
5,"Had a terrible afternoon at work. I work in a school and had a conversation with a parent via phone. The conversation got heated on her end because I could not bend the rules for her daughter. I explained the policies and she accused me of not caring about her daughter and sabotaging her daughters future. I understand that you’re going to come in contact with angry parents when working in education but it never feels good when you get off the phone. I care deeply about all my kids at school and try to help them in any way that I can, I just can’t bend the rules for them, it’s not fair to other kids. I hate being accused of not caring, I would not have gone into this job if I didn’t care. I wanted to explain that her but she didn’t want to hear it. I may have come across as annoyed on the phone and she could definitely tell but tbh I’m not proud of myself for letting her know my own frustration with the conversation. I think parents forget that the people that work with their kids are human beings and that we do our best. ",14Mar2019,3
6,"I could use a bit of advice if anyone has any to offer. But more or less I just need to get it out. I’ve never dealt with cancer this close in my family before. I don’t know how to deal with it all. 
My dad was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer just after New Years. It was the worst start to the year. Since then my dad has been hospitalized twice and has almost died both times. The cancer has spread from his lung to his brain and we’re not sure where else to- at this point- maybe his bones. 
He now has 7 brain tumours and has suddenly become diabetic and has already went into diabetic shock, causing him to lose most of his brain function. My dad miraculously came back to us, and is now at home again. The doctors don’t know how my dad is still a walking man. He is on so much medication now to stabilize him. 
I am in the deepest depression I’ve ever been in, watching him fight for his life. This has got to be the most painful thing I’ve ever experienced, to have to sit with my own father and talk about how scary death is. To have to see him cry. I love my dad so much it hurts. I cry myself to sleep most nights without anyone knowing. I don’t want my family to worry about anything else other than my dad right now. 
They didn’t tell us how long he has, as they aren’t sure. They have told us that getting treatment is not the best option as it could do more damage now than good. So I am currently going through anticipatory grief and it is just so overwhelming. I am so depressed. I can’t work, as I have to help take care of him. So I am in my own head all day long worrying and stressing and being depressed and I am trying so hard to stay positive and be grateful that my dad is still here, because that is a gift. But I feel like I’m drowning. I can’t even imagine how he feels. I’m so sorry to all of those out there suffering with this disease. It breaks my heart. Nobody deserves this. Nobody deserves this pain. ",14Mar2019,12
7,"I met my one best friend last night. We hadn't seen each other in months. She's a full Trump supporter now and it makes me so sad to see how far apart we are. She think the liberal media lies and Ben Shapiro or whatever his name is is the only voice of reason. She's fallen into this world of getting all her information from YouTube and not trusting formal media sources.

My other best friend got in a relationship a few years back. We used to spend every day together and were like brothers. His partner doesn't let him do things alone so I only see him with his partner. He's changed so much and to me is a shell of his former self. To me he seems so trapped in that relationship but he clearly believes he's happy and they are planning their marriage and adoption.

I went to my therapist today and he said it sounds like I need to mourn these past friendships and find new friends. I do my best to connect with both of them but eventually it feels like ""playing on broken strings"". 

I don't know at 32 to make new friends to replace these people that have been my everything since I was 5. I feel unequipped to be single at this age and losing the people that have been with me throughout my life.

8,"My birthday was on March 11th. I invited a couple of my close friends out to lunch with me. I have been getting especially close to one of my friends the past nine months. This has been a result of me getting sober (I met her in AA). She has watched me struggle and I have hurt her with my couple of relapsed because I drop her like a hot potato when I’m not sober. (I drop everyone when I’m not sober). Anyway. I’ve been making right of my wrongs and even made amends to this friend. 

We have been especially close for the past 6 months after I broke up with my heroin addict bf who relapsed. She has been there when he went to rehab and then jail and now that I don’t know where the heck he is. 

Soo... back to my birthday. I invited her to lunch to hang out for my birthday. She just came and hung out and didn’t do anything. Like she just came and talked. Didn’t get me a card (or write a card on a random ass piece of paper) or give me a piece of chocolate or literally do anything but show up. 

I feel like this is a silly resentment because she is not ENTITLED to give me literally anything... but we have gotten close so I felt like she didn’t give a shit and if I were her dad or boyfriend or something I would’ve gotten SOMETHING sentimental, but because we’re “just close friends” I just get a hang out. 

Perhaps I feel especially slighted because I have no family or significant other. My friends are my people, when they always have people who come before me. This feels especially lonely because I am not especially special to anyone. 

TLDR; one of my closest friends came to my birthday celebration lunch and didn’t do anything but show up and hang out (no gift or card). ",14Mar2019,1
9,"Light submission. I'm just losing my mind

I'm watching a man in his 40s, a man over twice my age, make macaroni and cheese for dinner. Y'know, the really simple Kraft shit. I'm fine with that, it's just barely a tier above eating cup noodles again.

What I DIDN'T expect was that he was going to nearly overflow the pan with cold water, *then* dump two boxes of macaroni into the pan before putting it on the stove. I'm shocked - that's gonna make it crazy soggy once it's actually ready, right?

But it doesn't end there. Then he gets the butter (or margarine more accurately), takes two huge spoonfuls of it, and *dumps it* into the cold water. It's floating around like some weird toilet aftermath. Slowly melting. At this point, I'm watching in horror. How does a man that's so far in life manage to fuck up boxed macaroni? The instructions are on the package. I knew how to make it before I was even allowed to use a stove.

Thank every god out there he didn't also dump the cheese powder into that watery hellish concoction. I would've had an aneurysm right then and there.

I knew he couldn't cook, it was pretty obvious from the start. But I never knew it was this desperate. This is exactly why I'm taking culinary classes. *This* is precisely why.

10,"So some background. I'm a teen in my last few years of high school. I'm diabetic, anxious, and the cherry on top is my depression. 

I feel like killing myself but I'm too afraid. I'm always feeling guilty and I'm just overall unhappy with myself and my life. 

I went on very very high doses of medication for anxiety and depression at age 10 and have had quite a few visits to my local mental hospital.

Anytime its just me and my thoughts, my mind wanders off to strange corners and I can't reel it back in until I just end up distracting myself by doing something else. When alone, my conscious seems to want to force me into fear constantly and I don't know why. I could have the best day ever and as soon as its quiet I can't stop thinking about illness, injury, accidents, death, cancer, losing a loved one- the whole thing. It always seems to send me into this chaotic loop that I can't get a hold of. 

I'm really happy the way my life is going right now. I've got solid friends and supportive family, and I'm pretty laid back overall. Not really afraid of much in my daily life. Fortunately, I've never had a problem with social interaction or public speaking, and this fear of my own thoughts makes me feel like a coward. 

I don't want to just push it to the side and forget about it. I want to tackle this head on but I'm not sure how. I've tried working on it at various times of the day, for example, I tend to turn off the radio when driving to force myself to, well, be with myself. The thoughts still come back, and it doesn't seem like there's anything I can do about it. The questions I have don't have answers and the problems I think about are ones I don't have.

I hope this makes sense, I'm not sure if this is the right place to put this, but I was hoping some of you guys might have some tips.

12,"Warning:This could just be me being an angsty teen or whatever but it didn’t feel like it to me. 

So my parents are “separated”  because they don’t want to be married anymore but they haven’t gotten a divorce yet, but they still live in the same house.   

They did find separate places 2 years ago. My dad kept the house and my mom moved to a nearby apartment. We did the 50/50 house thing for awhile but it didn’t actually have a schedule. Recently we moved so my brother could go to a HS with his friends ( it’s a long story but it makes sense). And when we moved they decided to move in together so me and my brother wouldn’t have to do all the moving between houses and also to save money. 

It’s nice, but my parents get on each other’s nerves so 
much. 

The tiniest things can set my dad into freak out mode like my brother not telling him his SAT scores when he got them or me wanting to text my mom instead of call her. Or when my mom doesn’t do things the way dad wants them done . And when my dad freaks out everything stops. He gets in a bad mood and he can’t let go of things. 

When my dad isn’t in a bad mood his choice of conversation is interrogation, philosophical talk out of nowhere, or jokes for toddlers.

He’s also old (60) which wouldn’t matter but, he doesn’t remember things. I’ll tell him something, he’ll forget about it, then get mad I didn’t tell him. When I tell him I did he says it’s not his fault he can’t remember things. I don’t care that he forgot, I care that he got angry at me for not telling him.

I don’t know why , but whenever I’m with my dad I just get so irritable and in such a bad mood, I usually just leave the room when he enters. I know sometimes I act differently when he says things than I would if my mom said them but everything he says just makes me revert to ‘teenager who doesn’t like talking’.

I like my mom more I can hold actual conversations with her and I enjoy being with her but she also annoys me. She’ll complain to me about my dad which I know isn’t a thing parents are supposed to do. 
Today she brought up a fight me and my dad had recently and when she complained about my dad she said “we should do something about this”. I think she meant talking to him or making some more rules. But **we** shouldn’t do anything. I’m 14 I shouldn’t be thinking about solutions to my dads problems. I shouldn’t even be hearing about this. They should be talking to each other, instead of my mom talking about this with me. 

My parents are also the kind to have bursts of passion that die out in seconds. About anything really a vacation, eating healthier, riding bikes together, or hanging out more. My mom or dad will bring it up at dinner and be surprised when neither me nor my brother seem excited about it. We don’t get excited because we know it’ll be gone in a week.

Lastly my parents relations confuses the heck out of me. They don’t “love” each other, not in the way married couples so. But they still hang out and watch TV together. It’s really confusing.

Now, I'm pretty bad at League. But I've worked hard to be a part of the club for like 6 weeks now--I'm more active in the discord and I show up to practices as often as I can, even though I'm not on a team. My best friend and my partner are on each of the JV teams and I ask them for help with getting better whenever they have the time.

I've been struggling a lot with feeling irrelevant--I'm not on a team and whenever we try to do 5 or 10 mans, I feed. I don't have any real standing in the club, at least as far as I was aware.. But!

15,"**Venting**

I’ve been dating my girlfriend for about 8 months now. I fell hard for this this girl because she ‘was’ perfect from the beginning. As the months went on, there was an incident where she states she didn’t cheat, but still ended up at a party with her ex. That was the first time I felt betrayal. I didn’t want to give her up so easily over a mistake she says she made. 

Things get difficult as the months continue. 
She left for 3 months because of marine bootcamp.  While she was away, she wanted me to keep up her snapchat streaks. I curiously stumbled upon messages I wish I didn’t see and that was my fault. I found messages where she gave out her number to guys hitting on her. There was one message where she was trying to meet up with one guy at 11:00pm, while we were dating. This is the second time I felt betrayal and disrespected. 

She returned last week, for a 10 day period. I was happy and proud to see her again. I spent multiple days with her and her family. Good times were spent. She left recently again for MCT, an extension of bootcamp practically. She asked of me to do the same with her snapchat streaks. This time I found out she blocked me from viewing her story and she also started texting her ex again. This time I don’t know what to think but betrayal. Three times I have felt this way. 

I don’t know what to do, break up with her or just continue on with the relationship without telling her what I saw. Again it was my fault to be stumbling upon her snapchat, but what can I say, we all get curious. I still don’t think this is a reason to break up with her since she never really cheated physically, at least that’s what I know. Why did she have to block me from viewing her story? I might be overlooking at small thing but it’s just makes me wonder why would she block me. 

I’m not in contact with her until the beginning of April since they can’t use their phones at mct. I don’t know what if I should simply drop this and let it go, or tell her I feel.

I want somebody to give a shit about how my day's gone or how I'm feeling or how I feel about this shitty blizzard that's been blowing through but nobody, not my mom, not my boyfriend, not a single person ever wants to talk to me about anything other than themselves

I'm so fucking lonely and pathetic that I would rather reach out to strangers on Reddit than talk to someone like my parents or my brother or my therapist but I'm so convinced that everything I feel is some sort of awful paranoia or I'm just being bitchy and over reacting

I just want to feel like someone cares about me, like really actually cares about me and I don't understand why?? Like am I actually delusional or do I have some sort of validity?? 

All I know is that I'm so so so close to just cutting everyone off and wallowing in my pathetic misery but i know that'll result in me crying about how ""nobody wants me boo hoo"" 

I know myself so well that I can foresee every step that might occur but I almmost hate these people for not caring about me. hate is too strong of a word I think, ""resent"" is probably better.

One of my best friends completely avoided commenting on it. Always deflecting to other questions ""wait you used to have  blue hair, what did bleached hair look like, make sure not to bleach your whole head it ruins the hair,"" etc. 
He didn't really reply too much at all besides those few things. 
This guy's my best friend, normally whom texted back quite frequently, within reasonable time or with an engaging conversation.
But with this it was, unusual? I almost felt as though I was fishing for a complement by the time I was gave up texting him? He wouldn't say anything about how my hair actually looked even after he was the one who asked to see a picture
(I had told him I was gonna get it dyed)

My own boyfriend said nothing...
I don't even know if I should call him that. I mean we both like each other, talked to each other about liking each other,
We do the goodnight every night and other cute things, but never have had a date...
We never run into each other in the day. Our relationship is a secret after all. He wanted to 'try' it out take things 'slow' and if it wasn't working we could still be friends and not have an awkward situation with our friends being children about it.

But he bumped into me during lunch while walking around with some of our mutual friends today. One of our mutual friends pointed out the change and said
""You dyed your hair,""  
""I did"" I replied a bit apprehensivly as as his tone was kinda like 'oh wow- that's ehhhehe😬...'
""Yeah,"" he said as he (in what I put together) obviously didn't like it but was horrible at hiding it.
(Honestly, I would prefer people not comment at first or pretend to like it for a least a few days before ruining my self esteem... So you know I don't have to hate my already self conscious self and a permenate decision I made?)

Not the end either my 'boyfriend' never texted me anything about it, he said nothing. Not even during the pass by in lunch (ok our relationship is secret, but aknowlagement wouldn't hurt even if it's a text after.
 I had updated him on when I was getting it dyed asked him if he had a no go color and didn't choose said color. He didn't say anything else so I went with a mix of what I wanted and hair dresser suggested. I know I said that wait a few days before commenting if you don't like it, but if your actually someone who supposed to support me or want to move into that position. I don't know if it's just me, but I'd want them to notice things like that or if they didn't like it say ""hey it's not horrendous, but maybe next time do(suggested thing) instead. Cause I feel ( blank) would suit you more""
You know?
My hair is wine red/cranberry red now and I have no clue if it actually looks good.

There were 4 people I distinctly remember commenting positively and it made me way more confindent. But none of them were really close to me. Everyone close to me made the situations really feel like they tried to avoided commenting or (like my dad did) said I'm glad you like it and when they first saw it had a fake smile... 
At least it seems that way to me. I'm also a very self conscious person, so that might be a factor...

Whenever I dye my hair I always have these times where I hate it and regret it, then love it. And that is a very bipolar experience at the beginning (especially) cause you can never exactly predict what it'll turn out to look like before hand. Hence why a few comments can make a person feel really good right? 

So I guess I don't know exactly my point, but I just not feeling great and questioning some things. I know I'll be fine and pull through and even if I end up not loving my new hair. I'll learn to live and make due. I don't know. I don't even know if this is the right subreddit for this, I lost my old account too so. Yay me 😅

19,"This was with my last boyfriend, the one before that and my current. Those are the only boyfriends I’ve had. It is always a huge issue in my relationships. The first couple months, I’ll be so turned on by them and wanna have sex all the time, then it just disappears. It’s weird though because I still enjoy masturbating. I don’t do it very often though (pretty much only on my period) because I fear it’ll make me not want to have sex even more, if I was single it would probably be every second or third day.

My last boyfriend and I had sex probably once a month (or less) after the first couple months. My current, probably a couple times a week but I feel like I have to mentally force myself to get into it. I still get orgasms but I still just don’t care about sex that much. And I know it isn’t because I’m not attracted to him, I love him. I just don’t care about sex. Sometimes I feel like it may have something to do with some unpleasant sexual experiences in my late teens but I’m not sure. I don’t think it’s anything to do with my body. I’m almost certain it’s all mental.

So can anyone relate? It’s really messing with my current relationship. He has such a high libido and I don’t have one at all. I totally get that different libidos is a big sign of incompatibility, but this isn’t as simple as that. I straight up just don’t have any libido.. when it comes to other people being involved. So why can I enjoy masturbation so much, but I’m turned off by the fact of having sex with someone I love? Is there a professional that I could talk to that could help me find an answer?

28,"I recently started a new position in my company about a month ago, and I’m finding myself hating it one minute then liking it the next. 

Before accepting this position, I was in a pretty cushy position (same company) where I made my own hours, no supervisor to watch over me, I came and went as long as I got my work done and a ton of vacation days and flexibility. Pay was decent too. I also was very good at my job knew it like the back of my hand so while it was comfortable, I was getting bored. Then one day a new job posting circulated and I applied for it thinking “what the heck” even though it wasn’t particularly a position I was dying to have just thought I’d give it a shot (again, because I was bored with my then present job for the most part) plus I didn’t really think I’d get it anyway but why not.

I went through the whole application process, assignments, panel interviews etc. and the farther I got into the process the more I thought i wanted the job. I then found out I was successful and actually beat the other 40 applicants who applied (some I thought were way more senior and qualified than I am). So naturally I had a bit of a confidence boost and decided that maybe it’s a great thing to be ambitious because i can do so much more with myself. Plus the new title within the company isn’t too shabby either. I felt proud of myself and earned a lot of respect from my peers. 

Long story short, while this new position is great for my career and professional development, I don’t go a day without questioning my decision. I now work super long hours, I have to bring work home, lost flexibility and have to be on-call (even when off) constantly have head office breathing down my back for deadlines. Plus the pay raise is not enough to change my life. More importantly, I no longer feel competent. I’m learning completely new tasks and everytime I’m assigned something to do I feel like an incompetent idiot, a fraud, worry that they’re going to figure out I’m not really qualified and my reputation within the company will go down the drain. I miss my old colleagues. I was a part of a family now I’m working out of a different location,isolated in my own huge office mostly all alone. No one to talk to. HOWEVER, having said all of that, everytime I tackle a task successfully, I feel motivated again and convinced I can do this. That it’s good to be ambitious. This is opening up a lot of doors for me in the future. So I’m basically Flip-flopping moment to moment. 

For my company, I actually have the option to step down and return to my old position if I want. I can just go back to my old comfort bubble and likely retire in that position, OR, stay where I am and stick it out. Before anyone reminds me I’ve only been doing this for a month, I completely realize that so maybe I just need to hear someone to convince me this will get better bc so far every morning I dread going to work. Sorry didn’t think this post would end up this long. If you’re still reading thanks.

TL:DR - I left a cushy easy job for a new position that will open up a lot more doors for me professionally but I feel incompetent and overworked and question daily if I made the right decision. Need advice or someone who experienced this. ",14Mar2019,1
29,"I feel so lonely, it's like I have the feeling that nobody is here for me even thought I'm being with my family since last sunday. 
I'm a student and I had to move to another city. It's at almost 1000 miles away from where I used to live with my family. I have a boyfriend but he lives 55 miles away from me, we go to different universities so we get to see each other every weekend. It happens that when he's gone, I start to feel alone and I just can't help it. Feeling lonely makes me feel sad so the only thing I want to do is to cry. I can't study even thought I love what I'm studying. I can't eat, I just eat when I really need it. I can't clean my apartment, I feel so blue that I don't feel like cleaning. I barely take showers. I can't take care of myself. I miss him so much I can't do anything and thats BAD. That's really bad and I'm aware of it, I just can't change it. I also miss my father, he's a great pillar in my life and I feel like I need him, I need him to help me get out of this hole I'm in while I'm alone. He helps me a lot, he tells me to call him whenever I need to and I do it, I always do it and I get to feel better but then I remember how much I miss him, my boyfrend and my mother as well. 
I have the need to listen to someone talk in that moment so I'm used to watch streamers, they always help me to not feel alone but it's not the same. I also play games online with a friend, he also helps me a lot when I feel down (and I really appreciate that cause he has not the obligation to help me but he still does it). I try to talk with my bf but he's sometimes working, playing or studying and even thought he replies to me and cares about me, I just don't wanna bother him even when he says I'm not doing it. I hate this feeling. 
Now I'm in my hometown staying with my family for a week because my bf is on a trip and I didn't want to be alone there where I live, I don't have friends yet because it's my first year at the university and I haven't met someone that I can call a friend. 
Yeah I'm with my family now but I still feel lonely, I cannot help it. I just want to cry, I can't eat, I can't contain the sadness I'm feeling right now. I have so much feelings and so many thoughts in my head I feel like I'm drowning. My father is the only one who knows this and he tries to help me. I'm staying at his house and I'm sleeping in his room because I feel alone when I'm in my own room. I need to feel contained and accompanied. I hate feeling this. I know is temporal but I can't do anything. I also see myself in the mirror a less fat than how I used to be. I hope this doesn't get any worse. 
When I was 15/16 I used to feel like this but it was different. I had my family near me but I wanted to be apart from me. Now that I'm 19 and I live far away, I just need them near me. I don't know what to do, I need my boyfriend he brings me happiness every time I'm with him. I'm going back to my apartment next monday, but it seems like these days are very very very long and I don't know how to pass them through. I spend time with my mom and dad, but I still feel sad because I know I'm not going to see them in a long time again. This is so hard. I don't wanna get professional help due to the fact that I don't like psychologists. I just don't have """"good memories"""" with any of these professionals I went during my teenage years. Help me. I need someone else to listen to me. I don't wanna get depressed, I don't wanna get worse. I can't even listen to musick because I get to feel sad even if it is a happy song, it's awful.

30,"Tonight I finally realized I have a problem with alcohol and caffeine.  I want to totally and completely cut out all substances in my life.  Really all I touch is alcohol and caffeine, both of which I fully admit I have a problem with.  I drink probably 32 oz of coffee in a morning and 3 drinks every night, without fail.  It's nothing more than habitual.  The caffeine gives me severe anxiety, and the alcohol makes me incredibly agitated and depressed.  

I'm not sure how to handle the early mornings where I'm half awake and everyone in my office is chatting with a cup of coffee in hand.  I'm not sure how to handle the nights where I come home to an empty apartment with my liquor cabinet staring at me and my bed calling my name.

But then I found out she did porn in the past. Totally fine, as it was in the past. However, it did get me curious to look a little bit further. The internet is pretty good for finding stuff about people. I found out she was meeting up with atleast one guy selling panties and sending nudes. I confronted her and she admitted. It had been going on for a few months. I see that as cheating but she didn't seem to think so atleast at first. Also, the lying for months about that was pretty terrible on her end. How could you say you love someone when you are doing things on the side sexually related and lying?? Lets just say it kind of crumbled down after that and I just couldn't continue dating her anymore. I've since moved on and couldn't be any happier with myself now, I've got lots of other things going for me so I'll just focus on myself for a looooong time now before trying to commit myself to another relationship.

I don’t really consume coffee, I don’t do drugs, and lately I’ve tried to have better sleep hygiene. It used to be really bad.

As many people who follow my profile will know, I have Foreign Accent Syndrome (FAS) along with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Paranoia, Anxiety, compulsive behavior (dermatillomania), and reoccurring Depression. Physically, I have Ehler-Danlos Syndrome, near-blindness, and a bleeding disorder. I have a service dog, Comrade, to help me get by on the daily.

Right now, I wanted to explain *why* I have everything that I do, all my mental disorders and FAS I mean. I'm very open about what I have and why and I thought it might be a good idea to share my experiences to the users of Reddit.

TL;DR at bottom... this will be long.

I'm coming right out to announce it: I grew up in an abusive household. There's no going back, I said it. It wasn't physical or sexual abuse, but it was verbal, emotional, and mental abuse every day. Some might argue that it can be more deadly, as that type of damage is internal instead of external, and therefore you have to be looking for signs to see or catch it, where as you can *see* physical bruises. I'm not here to shame or gain pity- my stance is that abuse is abuse no matter the form. It's all bad and malicious and *never* acceptable, regardless of the type. As far as I'm concerned, anyone who thinks otherwise is a monster.

Surprisingly, my family wasn't always abusive. I remember a time when they were kind and my father was this big cuddly giant, not a scary menacing one. I remember a time where my mother would lay with me in bed until I fell asleep, not send me to my room without dinner. I remember a time when my brother was my friend, my guardian who was 4 years older than me, not my enemy who wanted me to fail. My parents never actually beat me, but my brother did. He was smart though- he only gave me the occasional bruise every few months and on a spot that would be covered like my shoulders, back or legs. It all started when I was 8 years old, the abuse I mean. Anything you can think of, I lived it: gaslighting, bunny-boiling, shifting the blame, everything.

When I was just 9 years old, that's when the ""accident"" happened. My brother shoved me off of a ladder. We were outside, so I hit my head on the concrete. I would have died, I *should* have died, but thankfully I was one step on the ladder lower than lethal. Since I was in third grade, the doctors didn't explain anything to me other than ""I hurt my brain."" My parents, being abusive and cold, never bothered explaining to me what happened, what part of the brain had trauma, etc. They never told me anything for the entirety that I lived with them.

I started being ""odd,"" as other kids called me. I wasn't as outgoing, I fidgeted a lot, some of the stuff I said didn't make sense, I would laugh when something wasn't funny, couldn't understand sarcasm, and would never make eye-contact. Already, I begun being the *freak,* and I wouldn't be outgoing again until my last years before leaving my abusive family. Within the year, I started talking funny too. I would have a lisp sometimes, or stutter, or my words would get slurred or mashed together. I had funny ""accents."" It wasn't a specific language for say, but still, my voice was strange. My family ridiculed me for talking this way even though I couldn't help it. They called me dramatic and threatened that ""if I didn't stop talking so stupidly,"" they'd do physical. So, I only spoke the bare minimum at home.

By 5th grade, my vocal tics were worse and I had a slight sensitively to very bright lights, but I was more outgoing. People at school still thought I was a freak, but a nice and friendly one. I believed since I couldn't seem to do any good at home, I could try my damned hardest at school. I felt like the enemy at home, like my hardest wasn't good enough, like was never satisfactory. At school, I seemed to be adequate. My teachers seemed to appreciate me. It was all I wanted- acceptance, to be told ""you are good enough."" I always bent over backwards just to get any kind of praise. I'd make it to class early and stay late after school to clean up the classroom and straighten out all the desks. I didn't know this at the time, but this was the start of my compulsive behavior. At this point, I was loud and outgoing at school yet quiet and unassuming at home.

In 7th grade, I went to a new school. It was a very small college prep school. I passed all the entry exams and nailed the interview to be accepted. I was enrolled. When I started, it was nerve-wracking. It was my first year or switching classes every hour, taking the bus to and from school, and all of the classes were honors. I, for some reason, decided to be myself. My weird, comedic, fun and loving-self (while still being subservient and emotionless at home). It went well in the beginning I was *actually popular!* That had *never* happened and it never would until some later years of college. People knew my name, but I was still ""The Nice Kid,"" as I wanted it to be. My grades were fantastic, life (school) was good.

Then the bullying.

There was this group of older students who managed to manipulate me during 2nd quarter and roped me into a whole dramatic set, requiring my attention day and night, school and home. My grades suffered as did my popularity. When I got out of it, I had very few friends and a rougher home life. I was depressed. At the end of 3rd quarter, my ""best friend"" back-stabbed me with insane accusations (see my r/Prorevenge story), worsening my depression. I was left with one friend, who I call Luna, who would go on to be my best friend to the present.

8th grade was pretty uneventful. I made a few new friends (or more, ""friendly acquaintances"" if you will) and my home life worsened still. My father yelled at me almost everyday and my mother never supported anything I ever did. I didn't see much of my brother, but when I did, he called me names and scoffed at me. 

He also made fun of me for being a girl. If I didn't like how rough my brother played with his friends, when they would break noses and sprain ankles, it because nothing more of me being a girl- according to him, that is. This would manifest itself into an onslaught of self-image issues in upcoming years. I was convinced somehow that most of my ""faults"" was a result of me having XX chromosomes. I don't like spiders... not because I have a right to be scared, but because I'm a girl. I don't like to be assertive very much... not because I don't personally like confrontation, but because I'm a girl. I enjoy the arts... not because I'm creative and artistic, but because I'm a girl. I talk funny... not because you pushed me from a ladder and I hit my head on the pavement, but because I'm a girl. It came to the point where I would actively behave ""recklessly"" just so my brother wouldn't classify me as ""being a girl."" I would use swear words at school make comebacks that were sometimes more hurtful than witty. I didn't like it, but I couldn't stand the condescending words my brother would always spit at me: ""because you're a girl.""

No, I'm not personally transgender and I don't have any gender dysphoria, but I am more masculine than the average girl, probably as a result of my brother. I had to try so hard to consciously be masculine at such an young age (8) that it became habit for me. I don't say that I hate being masculine- I think it's just a part of me now. I am trying to accept the feminine parts of myself more though. For example, I would always refuse to wear dresses, going to pant-suits and bowties instead. Today, I still prefer to wear ties, but I'll at least let myself try on a dress before I tell myself I either 'hate it' or 'it's tolerable.' I like to think on the day Sarge and I get married, I will come down the isle by myself, wearing black dress pants, a black tie and no makeup, but also a black overcoat so long it looks like the train of a dress, tall boots/heels, and a wonderful pair of red gloves.

In my Freshman year, my brother still lived at home and commuted to college to cut costs. I made more friends. I walked to and from school every day. It was half an hour but I didn't mind, it was just more time by myself and out of the house. I stayed after school for clubs and I came in early for a 0 hour, anything to be out of the house. I kept straight A's even though I was in 3 classes beyond my grade level.

Socially, high school was okay. It, unlike my former school, was so large that you could blend in easily and there was much diversity from the numbers. I made a few friends in each of my classes and hung out with them a few times out of class, but ultimately none of them would last until I went to college (except Luna from 7th grade, of course). I was never asked out on a date and I never went to school events. I went to one football game to decide I hated it and left early. There were to many people, it was too loud for me, and I don't personally care that much for football. No, I didn't go do any other games or dances, including Homecoming, Morp, or Prom. I never went but frankly I don't think I regret anything. There were lots of drug users at my high school and parties, even if they were on campus, had some drugs floating around the scenes. I had been offered to try a suspicious substance once during lunch break, but I firmly declined.

I took as many classes as I could... I wanted to graduate early. By now it was a screaming match every night in my house, 3 to 1. I didn't fight them anymore, I thought it was pointless. I just took it. I did as much community service as I could on the weekends to make myself look as best as I could for scholarship offers. Sure enough, by Junior year, I graduated. A year early. I was ready to start my life at seventeen.

I moved across the country to the north-east of America. Luna came with me (she also made it her goal and graduated early for less-serious home tensions) and we became roommates. I got a hefty scholarship to a community college and I double majored in psychology and philosophy, and I minored in the arts (writing mostly) which I recently finished.

After our first year, Luna somehow convinced me to take a trip with her to France, that we were ""in the prime of our lives and need to be living!"" Thank *God* I went though, because it was on that trip that I met Sarge and we started dating by the end of the trip.

Sarge, even from the moment we met, has been extremely kind and patient towards me. I can't even begin to explain what I'd do without him... it's unimaginable. He gives me so much courage and support daily that it's unreal. He makes me laugh and likes my jokes in return. He doesn't judge me and he opens up to me in return. I love him because he doesn't treat me like some broken thing that needs special treatment, but a unique thing that deserves extra love.

He sticks up for me. I'm going to jump ahead for a second: my parents tracked me down once and came knocking at our front door once we were living together. I answered and saw hell on my doorstep. I had a mental shutdown in that doorway as they yelled and threatened and accused me of this as that. Sarge came from behind me and gave them a stern talking-to. He kicked them to the curb after condemning them and he took the rest of the day off of work to stay home and make sure I was okay. I know that I can trust this man with anything and that he'll protect me... I also know that I'll wholeheartedly do the same.

Long story short, we met, had a long-distance relationship for a year before he moved to the US on a green card, and then I moved out from being with Luna to move in with him. Turns out, he already was kinda a citizen. His mother was a dual citizen between America and Russia and Sarge just didn't know about it for 2 years. Basically, he was eligible for the dual citizenship as well. Some paperwork was done and he was officially a citizen as opposed to the usual 5-7 years.

Today, I still have many issues, but the difference is I know I'm not alone, as cliché as it all sounds. I have a great support system between my friends, Sarge, and Comrade, and I don't need my ""family"" that abused me and made me feel worthless. I can do what I love, I can share my stories, and I can be okay. Not fantastic, but not bad... okay.

I'm okay.




TL;DR- I was abused as a child, but now I have a wonderful support system to deal with everything and live my life to the fullest.

51,"So this adventure began with me picking up my boyfriend and heading over to my moms work (an elementary school close by) to meet the classroom pets they have, baby chicks. However, when we arrived, one of the kids had dropped a chick and it’s leg seemed to be broken. Some of the teachers felt it was unnecessary to help it, but being the animal lover i am i decided it would be no trouble to take it to the local vet clinic. However, when we got there, they told us they “didn’t do birds”. They referred us to another clinic that did. We then set out there, me in the passenger holding the chick in my hands/shirt to keep it warm, and my boyfriend driving. We arrive and they check it out, saying that they think it’s leg is possibly broken but need to do X-rays to make sure. They gave us a price estimate and unfortunately we didn’t think the school would pay the large bill for the visit. But they then referred us to a local wildlife clinic, saying we could surrender it and they would give it the care it needed. So we set out an hour drive there, only to arrive and have them tell us they “don’t do domestic chickens”. This for disease related reasons. At this point we’re beginning to lose hope, but they then refer us to another animal rescue. We called them many times but no answer, so we decided to go to at least try and see if they’d help the chick. However on the way there all of a sudden my boyfriend, who was driving, begins to move his hands about oddly and clench them as if they were tense or in pain. He told me abruptly that he needed to pull over, and so he did in the middle of a park in an area of Philadelphia that I was not AT ALL familiar with. He jumps out of the car and lays on the ground in the fetal position, and i’m getting out of the completely unattended car worried. I walk over and try to talk to him but he was completely delirious and speaking nonsense, saying he wanted to take a nap and laughing. He has a history of allergies so I begin to panic as he had no epi-pen with him. I immediately dial 911 and try to explain where i am even though I had absolutely no idea where i was. We’re both only 18 and I didn’t have my license on me so I couldn’t drive, nor do i have much experience driving in the city. I could not move him in the car either. Cars begin to pull over and people got out telling me they are medical staff, and others asking questions. At this point i’m completely terrified and trying to pay attention to him, the unlocked car next to me, the 911 dispatcher, and strangers asking me questions. The one stranger turned out to be a paramedic, and he helped me to give the dispatcher an exact location as to where we were. My boyfriends hands were turning blue and his body was rigid and tense and he wasn’t verbally responding nor were his eyes open. Police show up and I try to explain what’s happened in the last 10 minutes. They say they’re going to take him in the ambulance. I was told to park my car in a lot that would allegedly be open until 9 according to the officer, however it ended up closing at 6, and we were later ticketed. Though I was told to leave the chick in the car, the paramedics on the ambulance told me to get him and bring him with me. So I park the car, and with my belongings, as well as a chick wrapped in a blanket in a box in hand, I run onto the ambulance and begin to call my parents as well as his. They met us at the hospital and he received medical attention. All while trying to care for the chick in the waiting room and give it water without drawing attention. Though, his broken leg was getting worse as time went on and he hadn’t eaten in hours, so my dad ultimately made the final decision to take him to a vet that dealt with “exotics”, regardless of the very hefty bill. Me and my mom and my boyfriends family stayed and waited for my him, who after an hour or so came back out looking much better than before. My dad and sister left and took the chick to the vet in a different state. After a few hours (it being almost midnight then) had him X rayed and bandaged as best as possible. He is so young that his bones have not even calcified completely, so they weren’t sure if it was a break or a fracture. My dad and sister learned how to feed him with a tube and headed home. We now have a chick downstairs cuddled in blankets in a box over a heated blanket that needs to be fed every 6 hours and my boyfriend plans to seek further medical attention, as the doctors were unable to come to a conclusion on what had happened to him.

All which started out with a kid who dropped a baby chick.

Anyway I am on a weight loss journey. After literally a lifetime of being very obese, I've decided to take control of my health for the sake of my children. I want to be there for them for many years to come. It was hard for me to do when I was 350lbs, addicted to food and was out of breath all the time. I've been working at my journey on and off for 2 years. I say on and off because I fell off the wagon for 6 months and gained 40lbs! But I took control of that slip up.

So far I've lost 137lbs. I've done this by CICO diet control and the newly OMAD approach. I also done this by exercising with Team Body Project 4-5 days a week. I found their videos on YouTube and I found my thing. I loved the challenge.

Now for a year, I've just been repeating the free videos on YouTube. 2 days ago I decided to finally join the Team Body Project website and see what it had to offer. There's a community section on there to post typical questions and chats. There was one section in particular for success stories.

I posted my story along with a side by side comparison picture. This morning I get a wonderful email saying the founder of Team Body Project commented on my story. His words made my day. He told me I was inspiring and he was happy to have me apart of the Team Body Project family.

For those of you out there who struggle with their weight, I'm living proof you can do it. I went from a lifetime of obesity, to being average size now. I'm still working at it everyday.

58,"Disclaimer: please don't expect much of this story, I am just annoyed with his behaviour. In the conversation D-dude and F-friend.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday was a big day for me. I went to school and from 9:15 to 14:00 I was taking the biggest English exam of my high school carreer. Exhausted from this mental workout, after a nice Asian dish, I came home to rest for an hour. After that it was time to hit the city with my childhood friend and go to a karaoke bar. We haven't hung out for a while, so it was time. I put on a baggy jumper because it was cold outside and I didn't do my makeup, because I was too tired to do so. But I still didn't look as if I've just crawled out of a dumpster. When I met up with my friend, she had a glam makeup look and fit clothes on. I felt kind of like a kid next to her.

&amp;#x200B;

At the karaoke bar, there were these lovely Germans, who were cheering for us while we were singing Wind Of Change by Scorpions and Take Me To Church by Hozier. My friend noticed this dude and said: ""You should go get him hehe,"" because I am the single one. So far, everything was great. Soon, it was time to leave. We said goodbye to our German fanclub and set off.

&amp;#x200B;

As we were leaving though the narrow staircase, THE Dude said: ""Wait, you're the ones with the great voices, right?"" My introverted ass wanted to run away, because he was probably trying to start a conversation. My friend said: ""Thanks, yeah that has to be us.""  The dude turns to her and directs his words only to her from now on, obviously ignoring me. His eyes pinned at her. For the rest of the conversation I was standing quietly and awkwardly next to them. 

D: ""Why are you leaving?"" 

F: ""We have to catch the last train home."" 

D: ""Ohh what a pity. Where are you from? 

F: ""Town XY. Hey.. I have a boyfriend so..."" 

D: ""Oh, I'm not jealous heheh! Here, add me on facebook. You have a great voice."" He was really trying to flirt, since he couldn't hear just her singing, because we sang every word together.  

F: ""I knew I was good, but this good? I used to have singing lessons."" 

D: ""Why did you stop? A big mistake! Here, now we are friends on fb. I hope to see you here soon. Bye, girl!"" (singular) 

F: ""Bye!""

&amp;#x200B;

As we were walking to the train station, she couldn't stop talking about how this surprised her. I was nodding and smiling. But in my head I was wondering why he ignored me; was it because I was bare-faced? Because I was wearing something comfortable? I felt unattractive.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this normal or was he just rude? Or am I just a sensitive Capricorn?",14Mar2019,3

Anyways, I feel so distant from my family because I can’t bring my girl around. We’re both 21 and have been dating since about 18. I hate it so much, they only met her like 6 times total and my girls family is the complete opposite they love us and they respect us unlike my side. I have no words to describe how much anger and pain this brings to me. I now suffer with anxiety because I can’t be honest with my parents as to what i’m doing because i can’t bring my girls name up in anyway . I almost have a panic attack because i feel like i can’t leave my house. My mom hasn’t talked to me in about a year because of the argument that was brought up about my relationship. She said some nasty and disgusting things to me and I called her out by saying if you don’t have respect for me and my relationship, I won’t have any respect for you.

In the last month his dementia has gotten worse than it ever has before and I'm splitting watch duties with my aunts. When he's up and around I dread him asking where his wife is. She's been dead almost a year now and he spent her last two years caring for her as cancer slowly took her over.

Some times he's present enough to know exactly what's going on, but the rest of the time it's ten years ago. Telling him what happened to the couch is easy, explaining grandma being gone feels almost impossible. 

Watching that realization come across his face, seeing him pull himself together in his stoic way, I don't know if I can do it anymore. I know he's suffering more than any of us, but this experience is killing me.

Besides seeing him go through that pain I feel completely useless. Caring for him, cooking his meals, taking him to appointments, all feel right. But otherwise seeing him slowly fall apart like this makes me feel like I'm useless. I've started to hate myself and my inability to save him from this.

I really don’t know where to begin, and because of that I feel the only real way to explain my problem is to describe a little bit of what I’ve been through. 

I had my first girlfriend when I was 20 years old. I met her online playing counter strike global offensive. 

Before this I was completely emotionally disconnected. I was interest in girls and had girls interested in me but the thought of opening myself to another person and becoming so incredibly vulnerable was far too daunting. 

This first girl somehow forced me to reveal myself to her. She knew I was innocent, and I don’t want to say I was manipulated but she knew every right thing to say and do to make me fall for her and open up. 

When we split up I was devastated. Not only because I loved her and lost her, but because I connected with her and felt all the pain and devastation she felt from the break up in addition to my own. I was wrecked because I was losing the first and only person I had ever loved and revealed myself to, but also because I sympathized with her loss from the relationship as well. 

I felt so fucking horrible. I can’t fully articulate how horribly I felt. I had crushed this girl.  I had destroyed this person that I cared so deeply for. I felt guilty but it’s like it was beyond guilt. It was the feeling of guilt but amplified so intensely that in no longer felt like guilt but rather this incredible deep sadness. I can’t explain it I’m realizing. Nothing I write will ever do that feeling justice. 

I don’t know if I actually know what love is, but I really cared for this girl. I still do. I hope she gets absolutely everything she deserves.

And herein is where my issues have arisen. I now seek out the love I felt with this girl in others but insure that commitment and deep connection is not possible to avoid this horrible feeling. 

I am currently in multiple relationships with various women. Each relationship has strict boundaries. From the very beginning I explain that I am not seeking a serious relationship. “I do not want to be your boyfriend” I explain. I will be your friend and be there for you in your time of need just as any good friend would be, but we will never be together as a couple. 

All of them say they’re ok with this.

I now fear that in reality none of them are ok with this but only say so in hopes that they can “fix me.”

Am I hurting these women? Some of them have said they love me. Some of them don’t say it but, I suspect feel it. They emphasize that they know we’ll never be together but they love me anyways. 

I deeply care about these girls. They are my friends. I would do almost anything for them and have. Many of them turn to me when they need help.

I fear now that in my reservation to connect and open up I am only causing more pain. In fact I know this is the case. 

In reality I am writing this post not because I don’t know what I need to do. I know what I need to do. I need to separate myself and cease all communication with these women. I am hurting them.

I am writing this post because this is hard. I fear loneliness. I care for these women. I even feel as though I love them. And yet that is even more reason to stop this. 

My dilemma lies in that if I am unable to connect even superficially then I must be alone. 

This is scary. I don’t want to be alone. 

So then obviously the only solution is to fully open up and commit. This seems impossible to me now.

It’s like I’ve forgotten what it’s like to be in a real relationship, and I am only capable of connection at the surface level.

I’m rambling at this point. Thanks for reading. Any help appreciated

78,"This is coming from multiple things, including being fresh out of college in a job field I don't want to do long-term. Plus being informed the career path I want to take may not be possible for me because even entry-level positions require years of experience. And those entry-level positions are where I would be going to get that experience.

Another big thing contributing to this unhappiness right now is the state of my (23) relationship with my boyfriend (29). Over the past several weeks, his mental illness worsened, yet he kept it under wraps without telling anyone, and once it was to a breaking point, he began to take everything out on me. He may have had a few complaints about the relationship prior to this episode, but he didn't share them and when he got to this bad state he used them to lash out and accuse me off not being a good enough GF or doing enough to help him, and basically harbored resentment forwards me that was built up and misdirected because of the mental illness. And I'm obviously oversimplifying everything because this is a Reddit thread, but it was very emotionally draining for me, as he kept doing this then apologizing and asking me to come back over because we needed and missed me, and then it happened again. And I also felt I couldn't really tell how much of what he said was true about me and our relationship, and how much was the mental illness talking. We finally left his place and we just agreed to take a bit of space and reset, and work on things once we had some time away. Which I have no problem with, but he has to take responsibility for his mental health and get the help he needs. I haven't seen him in a week and a half, but we've been talking like everything is normal, which I suppose is good. The thing is, I don't really miss him, my heart just feels so plugged up. I didn't feel this way at all until this happened, literally the opposite. I don't know, just needed to get that out because it's been on my mind and really bothering me.",14Mar2019,2

It was laughable about how bad it was. They for real skimmed the surface of the plot/characters to create an “entertaining” movie.

They showed up an hour later and I noticed my mom was upset. She refused to eat anything and when I asked if she was okay, she told me she'd tell me later.

After we left the restaurant, my mom and I were walking to the car alone and I asked what happened.  What she told me just made my heart break for her.  She told me that he had left her absolutely nothing in his will and that she guessed he didn't love her after all.  I was shocked but now that has been replaced by anger.

84,"I’ve been in college for the past few months and arrived home on Monday for Spring Break. Prior to coming home I visited my girlfriend at her school for our anniversary. While I was there I was wearing a black headband that I own. My gf also gifted me a bond touch for our anniversary, it is basically a bracelet that you tap and it sends a vibration to your partner’s matching bracelet. It’s actually pretty cool. 

Before I left I swear to God that I packed it I vividly remember doing so and my gf says she remembers saying that I did. I was also still wearing the black headband. 

Now I’m at home and it’s been 3 days since i got back and I had not taken out the charger before today. But when i went to get the charger it was no where to be found, I checked my bags and my coat but I simply cannot find it. I also tried to get my black headband but again it is absolutely no where to be found. 

The last thing I lost was one of my winter gloves which again I seemingly cannot find anywhere. 

This is so frustrating. My house is not very large but it’s bigger than the one room dorm that I’ve been living in for the pas few months so if I lost something there there are much less potential places where it could have gone. 

I just don’t know what to do. Especially about the bond touch charger because my gf spent a good bit of money on them and I enjoyed using it. I know it’s my fault that I lost all of these things but I just needed to vent I guess.

85,"Ever since I was a little boy it was like a fantasy I thought of doing if the time ever felt right. Same as the zombie apocalypse, what you'd do if your country was invaded, how you'd live if you had super powers - could I gamble a moderatly small amount of money and turn it into a small fortune?

I'm going to do it. I want your thoughts.

I did a test run the other day, it failed but regardless I went in with £20, got to £50, left with £40. If it had worked it should have been around £60 an hour. That felt like the hardest part, sometimes you will have been there for 45 minutes and gained nothing but lost nothing, I call this starting over. 

So the idea is I need to save £511. There is a max bet limit of £500 on the machine, this is very important.

This isn't a method I created, I stumbeled along something and i've adjusted it to suit me. It's quite well known i'd imagine.

You start with £1 bets (I prefer to bet on red) on red, you want to lose that £1 bet but if you win it that's fine you just won £1. 

Every time you lose a bet you double your stake, so when you lose £1 you then bet £2, then when you lose that £2 you bet £4, when you lose that £4 you bet £8, when you lose that £8 you bet £16 - this is where it gets interesting.

It's unlikely to lose this many bets in a row, the most I lost in a row was 4. If you lose your 9th bet in a row, you lose and you have lost money. But as long as you never lose 9 in a row, you will always be gaining money.

If at some point you are for example on your £16 bet and you win it, you go back to placing the £1 bet.

Thoughts? I don't have much to lose and I want to move out of my flat into a house. I'm going to save up the £511 and give it a shot, I guess the aim would be to go in with £511 and leave with £1000+.

If it worked, I could then do it again.

I live in Texas, and the requirements for a person my age is a mere 6 hours of in-class instruction and no behind-the-wheel instruction at all. Of course, I intend to practice as much as possible before taking my driving test, but compared to the requirements for people under 18, it doesn't seem like enough.

Furthermore, my mom, who is a decent but informally trained driver, is going to teach me. I would like to take a proper driving course with a trained instructor, but I can't afford it. The only thing I can really do is obsessively study the Texas Driver Handbook and watch as many safe driving videos on YouTube as possible.

He's not a doctor but he's the orthopedics guy who was there IN the operating room when I was days old as doctors removed the foot from the stump of a leg that I was born with. The foot was removed so that a slip on prosthetic could be designed for life. 

He's seen me go from an infant to the immature adult I am today and he most recently designed the leg I've been using since 2015. He's designed every leg I've worn, but this one has been without a day the best, it hasn't failed once. Past legs have all had issues, but that comes with the territory, but once I got older and was able to accurately communicate my exact specs, he created a leg that has enabled me to live my life exactly as I wanted without ever worrying.

I'm in a Starbucks right now, and I'm just feeling a bit unhappy with my life right now.

I graduated debt-free with a journalism degree (lol, I know) last year, and have been picking up work where I can. Right now, I'm doing freelance copywriting. I work for a grand total of two or three hours per day and make more than I ever have, which honestly isn't much. But I don't feel like I'm going anywhere doing it.

I also feel like I squandered college, somehow. I participated in all the appropriate clubs and got good grades, but it all still just got me here. I don't even have any mistakes I can show for all the time I spent so far. I've never had a bad relationship, never failed a class, and I still feel so fucking empty.

Probably because I never had a relationship in the first place to turn into a mistake. I never had friends up until recently, mostly because of traumatic childhood shit.

Everything in my life has been by the book, and now it feels like I'm at the final few pages, and I just don't know what to do.

I can't sleep much anymore because of it, and because of a bunch of other stuff. I've been drinking a lot more, I started smoking more. All the signs are there that I'm not doing well, but I honestly can't tell if I'm okay or not. I don't have the problems most people have, I really don't have anything to be upset over. I just don't know if I have anything at all, and it's wearing me down.

Now, the only thing keeping me going is the hope that things will just work themselves out. All I need to do is keep waking up and getting out of bed, and one day things will be better — that's what I tell myself. I need to have faith that it's true. But I'm not that sure.

I don't even bother talking to her about the smell, because I know she doesn't care, and I know I'm the problem here.

**The post isn't about me asking advices or solutions, I only want to know if I'm fucked up.**

Alright. I kind of investigated, and found out the smell I hate might be onions. She loves onions and put them everywhere, so I guessed it might be it. Then I went to eat at her grandma's house, she cooked with onions (a lot of red onions) and it smelled ok!

[**Here's what I think about everything my girlfriend cooks (and also when her mother cooks)**](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TQHN_FxY48c/hqdefault.jpg). The episode comes with the same smell, to me.

Pike are tremendous fighters while most of the local fish are the over-abundant Rainbow trout which barely fight at all.  Plus they clean out the junk fish and the sick/injured fish.

Seems like stocking the Pike is a good idea to me.  No more traveling to Canada to catch them there.",14Mar2019,1
