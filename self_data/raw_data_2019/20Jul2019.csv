I would ride it during the day but it's been at least 95 degrees Fahrenheit (or 35 degrees Celsius according to the interwebs.)

9,"For some context, I am traveling around western Europe by myself (18F) for the summer. I was (am) really sheltered, and many people would describe me as ""innocent"" aka no drugs, alcohol, never kissed (cheek, tongue, anything), no sex, nothing. I am lucky enough that nothing has ever happened to me, and I don't want anything here to detract from real victims of violent and/or sex crimes. I don't know why, but I feel the need to write this since I don't have anyone to tell, really.

&amp;#x200B;

Never having done anything ""wild"" in my life, I really wanted to be a bit more 'out there' and meet more people as I floated from hostel to hostel on my trip. That's why, when I was in London outside of an asian cafe (i'm asian) and a random \~40 yr old male approached me and asked me about something on the menu, I politely answered. We engaged in some conversation outside the cafe, and he suggested we go to a nearby garden area. Seeing as it was in Soho (a really busy area in London), I thought why not, nothing would happen with so many people around. We went to the first garden, sat down for a bit, started talking about life, mostly getting to know each other. The garden closed and he led me to another garden, which was completely occupied, and then to another tiny park area close by. At this point I had no idea where I was, just that I was still close to the main streets, but the number of people around me had lessened quite a lot. Traveling alone as a female had really taught me to stay pretty alert of my surroundings, but there were still people, and nothing other than talking had happened so I still figured everything would be alright. We talk a bit more about life, jobs, etc. and at this point I'm getting a bit bored of casual conversation and want to wrap things up and leave to go shop or go back to my hostel (\~6-7pm). As I get up to leave and wave goodbye, he goes for a hug. Ok, I'm not usually a hugger but sure, this guy just told me his life story (everything from job to sex life), a quick hug and goodbye. As I go in for the hug though, he pulls me super close and tight and I don't know like runs his tongue all over my neck and ear, even going into the ear, like tasting it?? I'm very freaked out, and try to retract a bit, but he holds me in and just continues on the other side of my face. I'm basically holding his hip awkwardly. It seemed like he was going to stop but he runs his nasty tongue across my face and tries to kiss me. Obviously, I was not into this and turn my face to the side, but he kisses my cheeks and stuff. I was pretty shocked and didn't know what to do. But after forever, he breaks off and takes my hand to lead me to god knows where and says something about a massage at his friend's place, yada yada. Honestly, I thought he was just going to drop me off (lol i know) back at the cafe we met at. He leads me through the roads to this hotel that his friend is at, saying things like, ""I think my friend will be very jealous that I am with you"" and stuff like that. I just smile/laugh politely, letting him lead on. Once we get in front of the hotel though, I am terrified and do everything I can to stall. Every time I'm like, ""no, I need to go back"" he just works harder to convince me, referencing things that I agreed in conversation earlier like ""no regrets in life"" and ""experiment, follow your passion"", etc. He follows all this with compliments like ""I am so passionate about you."" Eventually he gives up on the massage, but is intent on leading me on walks throughout the area more. I say 'lead' because he seemed quite familiar with the area and I didn't know where I was/my orientation. Eventually, we walk by some pretty empty alleys and my spidey senses are like, ok I really should leave asap. I try to leave again, saying I need to go home, but again he's adamant and suggests drinks or coffee. We're close to a main street, but near an empty alley. I'm looking around a bit, and keep trying to part ways amicably. I keep saying I need to go but he just wont let go of my hand. Eventually, some girls and a guy come close enough where I guess he felt a bit threatened (?) and let me go. I don't look up as I felt ashamed and embarrassed, but thank goodness those people were there, because I don't think he ever would have let go otherwise. He's not gripping me in a death grip, no, but holding on even as I clearly wanted him to let go. Just to clarify. I get to the main street and manage to find a map as I didn't want to get my phone out and stand in a place for long. I just wanted to keep moving away from him. The map shows me how to get to the tube, at which point I know my surroundings a bit better and how to get back to my hostel. He's still beside me, following me and catching my hand so we're holding hands as we walk. At this point I'm pretty much leading the walk just trying to get to the tube, and we're on a main street. He asks me what he's done wrong to offend me, and I just say ""We're different, you wouldn't understand."" I didn't really know what else to say as I guess I was too embarrassed to say I was uncomfortable around him. Luckily, he gives up as we approach the station and basically drops my hand as a lost cause, basically.

&amp;#x200B;

That's it. Nothing too terrible happened out of everything that could have. I just feel so stupid and naive. I knew it wasn't ""safe"" to go off with a ""stranger"" (woo 5 year old lessons), but I thought I was smarter. No, instead I was just an easy prey for a creepy guy who hangs around asian shops and preys on young females. I wish I would've just pushed him away when he first leaned in for the kiss(?) I don't know what to call whatever he did with his tongue. Or just dropped his hand and left all throughout the walks. Or just firmly said no and walked away confidently. Everything that I was taught to do, I should have done. but I didn't do anything. I just followed along and was 'polite' and 'respectful' throughout everything, because I didn't want to hurt his feelings (I think, after thinking back). Who knows though, everything is a blur and now and I don't even remember the shirt he was wearing (that had his company's name on it). Now I feel super distrustful of all men who tries to be friendly or engage in conversation with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been over a week now, since everything happened, and I don't really feel anything. It grosses me out and I shudder every time I think of his tongue and stuff, but it's just life, eh? Like what do you even call this, sexual assault? Assault? It's not like I could do anything about it. I don't know, and I feel overdramatic just sharing this because again, nothing really happened in the grand scheme of things.

12,"I used to have Facebook, tumblr, pinterest, instagram, youtube, all that, then deleted them one at a time just because I felt like they were becoming toxic and it was affecting my mental health. Back then instagram was just starting to become popular and not nearly as toxic (ig models werent a thing) but facebook had been around for a while, I wasnt that into ig to begin with so it was easy to delete but facebook was very hard to get rid of. Took at least 2 years + multiple failed attempts until I finally got freeeeee. 

Then I found Reddit. And it was amazing. So many helpful resources, interesting comments (personal stories from people) and cute kitties. So much to learn! But its started to affect me the same way as all the other social media and I need to get out. I obsessively browse reddit, jumping from one thread to another, reading hundreds (if not more) of comments by random strangers most of which isn't even useful in my life and some that are actually harmful mentally. 

I keep coming back to reddit because there are some actual helpful places (like the skincare, beauty, fitness/diet subreddits). But I've gone over these subreddits so frequently that I think I pretty much already have all the info these places can offer, except the support/reassurance. But I dont even make use of their support. So there's no reason for me to be here. I'm just wasting time and overwhelming my brain with unnecessary bits of info.

I need to get away and actually live my life and help myself. Reddit isn't helping and I need to leave for good.

I'm writing this as a way to kind of pump myself up to leave and process/admit how badly reddit has been affecting me. 

I'm going to miss reading from people on here :( one of my favorite things about reddit was reading about the different experiences of people. But I know you're all out there living your life and experiencing things even if I'm not here to read all about it. Its better to hear about people's experiences in person anyway, that's how you connect and create bonds/friendships. On reddit we read thousands of experiences but rarely ever make a personal connection/friendship with the person whose experience we were able to learn about. And then we kind of become numb to it all. Its not healthy.

19,"I live in a Midwestern state and have hardly traveled outside of it. I've only left the Midwest twice, only went on a plane once. Once I went to NYC and another time to DC but each time was only because I was able to get the whole trip paid for. I'd never be able to afford traveling anywhere more than a few hours' driving distance. Never seen the ocean, never seen mountains, never been outside the country, etc.


One of the only things I think about that would be worth living for is traveling and seeing different parts of the world, but it's so unbelievably expensive. A plane ticket just to somewhere else in the continental US costs more money than I've ever had at once. That isn't even just true right now, it's most likely true for life or at an *absolute* minimum for about 10 years.



My credit is abysmal. My credit score is like 380. I have almost $20,000 in collections and haven't made a payment on anything in over a year. I was getting fired from jobs for a while bc of depression but letting me get out of bed for days at a time and operated on credit just for the bare necessities. Then I failed out of college for the same reasons and so now my student loans are in default too. I can't pay any of this. My credit will be destroyed for life and I'm not even gonna be able to afford necessities let alone travelling.


I wanna go to Norway, the Netherlands, Scotland, Iceland, Alaska, Colorado, Denmark, Ecuador, Colombia, Cuba, India...

Life brings me no joy, so I've decided to create it myself.' That seems like a good summation of how my life is going right now. Even if things aren't so great, I'm still pretty content. There are people who love me and care about me, who see my progress for what it truly is and see past my bad habits into who I truly am. I may be unemployed, living in my car, but I can always appreciate the clouds, the stars, the animals, and the people around me. There's always wonder and beauty to be found.

There are many nights when I have to WILL myself the strength to go back in for the Bedtime Showdown. The painful patience sometimes is all I can bear!

I thought tonight was going to be just that. A showdown of wills. Even AFTER swimming for three hours on the hottest day of the year. Even AFTER a bath.

She was physically tired, but that brain of hers was trying to run the show. I could almost visibly see the struggle, and wanted to calm that mind of hers down so I asked her if she remembered when her bedroom was across the hall?

She nodded “yes”

I asked, “Do you remember when I used to tell you that your little heart was tired and you needed to let it rest?”

She shook her head “no” 

“Do you remember the song I used to sing you at bedtime?”

Again she said “no”

So I began to sing it. When she heard her name in the song, the biggest, proudest, sincerest smile spread out over her face and she buried her face in the crook of my arm. I sang it over and over again (it’s only got 10 lines) well after she fell asleep, hoping the memory of this night could somehow be recalled for her whenever she may need it.

This is just a reminder to me mostly, but all parents struggling with wild children: 

Behind the protesting faces, and the screaming, and the slammed doors, and the “you’re a Meanie”’s, behind the hitting or scratching, behind the tell-tale scab across the room their eyeballs do while locating a new target to destroy out of spite, your baby is in there and could use a little extra security.",20Jul2019,10

The first time it happened was when she started talking to this group of guys they were in their mid 20's, and she started dating a guy that was 22 years old. She started holding hands and hugging the first night they met, and then went into kissing, pressing against each other all the time the day after they met. I'm not sure if this is normal, or if it's normal to even have a 15 year old to date a 22 year old, which really freaked me out. After they broke up after about a week, she met this guy online and they started dating shortly after. 6 days after they started talking, she started face-camming with the guy [16] and after she left some texts open, curiosity got the best of me and I  decided to read some. I instantly regretted it after I saw vulgar and erotic texts, as well as him saying things in walls of texts in a call, which I'm sure she did some things while they were alone.

Maybe it's my lack of hobbies. Besides studying, working part-time, and self maintenance stuff e.g. cooking healthy food and going to the gym, I don't do much except play video games. I've been trying to start drawing and reading, but at the end of the day I feel very tired and don't want to such mentally engaging tasks.

Maybe it's my small social circle and my fear of taking risks. I'm fairly introverted and commuting to college from home; my contact with people my age is very limited. I'm an only child of immigrant parents and it's just me and my parents on this side of the earth. My boyfriend lives three hours away. It's a bit lonely sometimes. 

Maybe it's because I don't have a career path that I can say I'm passionate about going into. I can't see myself becoming a devoted professional unlike so many of my friends. At the same time, I'm not exactly sure what I want out of life. I would work hard to maintain a stable career, doesn't have to pay a ton, as long as I can pay the bills; I would prioritize my family, live a simple life ... what else is there?

anyway as of recent i very thankfully have a great job that allows me to afford these things and while i still put money in my savings account, i spend a lot on clothes.

even living in NYC i don't see everyone wearing a shirt that reads 'BALMAIN' for $450 or $670 gucci sneakers, or a 5 figure rolex. it's fairly common but not everyone has it. when i go back to my hometown i get ""made fun of"" for the fancy credit card i use and people distance themselves from me because they think i think i'm better than them.

i work for my older brother and he is very successful but he isn't flashy and especially isn't around my \[immigrant\] parents because i think he feels bad because truthfully, he's made more money at 34 than they have their entire lives. the guy wears a $50,000 watch that he paid for cash, and my dad is just finishing a 25 year mortgage of like $250,000. he told me not to tell our parents about his watch, or any of the finances he does.

i work really hard so that i get the things i want but sometimes i feel bad around some friends and family who aren't as fortunate as my brother and i but why should i feel bad?? these are the things i value most, and i bust my ass every single day and it wasn't handed to me i earned it, so i think i deserve it.

my brother doesnt talk about money to my parents but i do. i'm moving into a new apartment soon and my mom asked what my budget was and i told her and she choked up and said how proud she is of me, and that the only thing better than succeeding yourself is seeing your kids do it.

42,"So first of all i would of posted to r/sex but after 5 attempts on two Seperate accounts i could not, i dont how “interesting” the title has to be.... :( 



So a girl (26) from highschool messaged me (m 25) on facebook we end up talking go out for a walk at 9 and dont leave for home until 3 am. We have been texting a lot since then and are extremely compatible socially. I can tell she is super into me and this is something i have become to used too so that is not a problem. 

But the on thing is...i dont know if we will be compatible sexually. ( i am an extremely self concious submissive guy, and she is a very confident submissive girl into rough play) We started talking tonight about hanging out again on monday and things got...raunchy. She asked “will you make me cum on your dick with you inside me” and “cum on my face while i look up at you begging for it” “with ny tongue sticking out” she said this is what she was thinking about as she touched herself.  I told her i would and now i cAnt stop thinkn g about the pressure i have now for our first time. I already have an issue in the size department that causes me to second guess my self, now ive already agreed to make her cum using only my dick!  

I am so worried that this really cool chick who thinks so much of me, will hate me after she realizes i am the complete opposite of what she wants.",20Jul2019,4

This stupid video game is coming out next week, and I’ve been hyping it up to my friends, all of whom regularly play video games. Still, I tried not to completely dominate the conversation, but even then my excitement was largely met with total apathy. I tried discussing it with friends who I knew were fans of the series, and still...nothing.

Today I just got sick of it and outright asked one of my friends if I was being annoying about it, and she said yes. Now I just feel like I can’t be excited about anything around these people who I consider to be my best friends. If I’m failing to curb the behavior, then I ought to shut it down completely, right?

48,"I’m (F) 19, I turn 20 in September. I feel so alone all the time. I have one close friend who I used to consistently talk to and now he is “talking” to someone.
Not to toot my own horn but I am beautiful and I have an amazing body, people tell me I have an a great personality, that I am open and sweet and I know how to talk to people and keep up a conversation. The truth is, it’s really hard for me to talk to people and keep up a conversation, sometimes you just gotta fake it until you make it and that’s me. I’ve had depression since I was 11 and only started taking antidepressants when I turned 17, I recently stopped taking them. In high school I hated my life, I had a boyfriend at the time who was my friend but other than that I was usually on my own. When he couldn’t be with me, I would be myself. I wasn’t like the people that I went to high school with and I knew that, my mindset had always been different and I felt as though I didn’t fit in with anyone around me. Once I graduated and me and my boyfriend broke up, I didn’t have anyone for about a year, after a year I made some friends for maybe 3 months and we stopped hanging out...I guess they were summer friends? One of those friends was someone I knew in high school who I knew was toxic (let’s call her R) but she was someone I had fun with..and at the time I was craving fun because I hadn’t experienced that type of happiness all throughout high school. Eventually I found out she had been stabbing me in the back throughout our entire friendship and talking negatively about me whenever I wasn’t around...it was really disappointing but deep down inside I always knew..I just didn’t want to believe it. One of the other friends I stopped talking to was really close with R, and I decided I wanted to attract positivity, and that started with surrounding myself with people who spread positivity and genuinely care about my well-being, which she did not. The 3rd friend moved out of state for college, we kept in contact for a few months after she moved but things slowly drifted away. 
After being depressed and anxious everyday in middle school and high school, and going through trauma my first year of college, I was ready for change. I entered 2019 with a new spirit, mindset and view on people and life. I’ve since been able to improve myself in order to better not only me but the world around me as well. Although I practice yoga and meditation, I find myself having a  hard time attracting positive energy. I have yet to find a best friend, I don’t even know what a best friend is at this point. It makes me so sad, I know I’m young and I have my entire life ahead of me, but being so lonely now reminds me of when I used to cry to my mom about how lonely I was in high school and how I felt like no one likes me...I remember crying and crying and feeling worthless because no one ever asked me if I was okay, they just automatically assumed I was mad or had an attitude.
I’m usually really strong but right now I feel completely defeated, I feel weak and sad, I know I have myself to blame partially but I also for some reason am unable to attract the positive energy that I’ve been sharing with others. 

I’m sorry that this post is all over the place and I’m sure not a lot of people will get through the entire thing but it felt good to sit and type this out since I don’t have anyone to talk to about it, I’m letting out all of these tears that have been ready to come out for months but haven’t been able to. I’ve finally broken and I’m not sure what to do anymore. Happiness is something that is so important to me and lately I haven’t been able to feel it genuinely, which really disappoints me. 

Anyway, goodnight. I hope you are all appreciative of the genuine friendships/relationships that you have in your life.",20Jul2019,3

50," I'm mostly posting this out of some intense, in the moment, paranoia. Enjoy your read into my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

The story starts as I'm walking home from work today, fresh off the train and on my way back to the comfort of my bed around 12:50 a.m. I live in L.A. and while I'm not necessarily in a bad neighborhood, walking any area alone at night can be worrisome. I'm going down the street and as I'm about to pass a Mexican food stand this guy, customer I assumed, approaches me. He offers me anything I want from the stand, he's paying. My brain is already telling me to walk away because I don't like getting anything for free without paying someone back. I try to refuse and walk away but I severely lack the skill to say no thanks and walk away if you insist more than once, plus I'm hungry so I submit. I just order something I know, a Quesadilla a.k.a grilled cheese and he talks to me, asking questions and this is where I fucked up, and answered *everything* honestly. I don't know why but I don't have the full capability to lie unless it's to people I know. Do normal people automatically lie when speaking to others, am I the odd one out? The conversation went somewhere along the lines of:

**""How old are you?""**

""20.""

**""Do you work?""**

""Universal Studios (A theme park for those who don't know).""

**""Full Time?""**

""On-call.""

**""Are you in school?""**

""No, but I plan to in time.""

**""You seem smart, you should go to school. You would really get far with a good education.""**

""I can't really go to school because I move around a lot.""

**""Moving? Where are you from?""**

""Ohio"".

**""How long have you been here?""**

""A few years.""

**""Alone?""**

""With my Mom.""

**""Ah. Are you gonna get a drink?""**

""I brought water from work, so I'm fine,"" I proceed to show him my used Gatorade bottle now half-full of water.

**""I got some water in my car.""**

The stand vendor hands me the Quesadilla and he pays, the stand guy says either six or seven dollars, my memory is shit and I feel bad because I could just go to Taco Bell for a $1 quesadilla if I really wanted a quesadilla, regardless I am indebted officially. 

**""You can have the change.""**

Not even coins but a couple of dollars. Fuck, more debt. I didn't count how much it was, still haven't.

As we walk 2 steps around the corner to his car he opens the door and hands me some water bottles, and asks the question that made me start really questioning the situation. 

**""Who is your internet provider?""**

I say I don't know know because my Mom pays the bill. My first lie finally, a tenant I assume, has a WiFi setup open to the whole building.

**""Spectrum?""**

""I think so?""

**""*****Something Something Something*** **I could give you 5 years of internet for a single payment,""** he proceeds to show me his toolbox in his trunk.

*""Oh?""*

He hands me his business card, says goodbye and we part ways. I still have another block until I'm back home and my brain is splitting. My head is a dreadful mix of optimism, creativity, and naivete, and I try to understand wtf just happened as I now have a free Quesadilla, some water and change on me.

&amp;#x200B;

I first think ""Good things happen to good people"" and remember I haven't done anything to warrant receiving anything good and decide to maybe slide some of what I received to one of the homeless folk along my way. I only saw one tent and considered my options:

* I leave some water. They never see it until morning, it gets hot and nobody drinks it because who the hell drinks hot water in the summer?
* I leave some cash. It blows away. Tuck it under something. The person never sees it or gets up and thinks i'm trying to take their stuff and attacks me. Has happened before, people are crazy.
* I leave the quesadilla. I attempted to make dinner for my Mom's birthday yesterday so I could always eat *that* over the Quesadilla. Don't leave it on the ground with these large ass cock-roaches walking the streets, that's unsanitary. Don't try to tuck it in somewhere for previously stated reasons. I'm not waking this person up, they could be a nut-job.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately I decide to keep everything and save the water for the next time I go out, hand out some cold water on a hot day.

 I retrace what the guy said, calling me smart, and I remember all the people who said I was smart as a kid and how I could become the president and other things like that (which really fucked my ego growing up). I imagine a future where I, now rich, take my wealth to help the poor and homeless. I've been ""living-out-the-car"" homeless and I've been ""home-on-a-safe-street-get-whatever-I-want-for-Christmas"" rich and I can understand how shitty it is being in shitty circumstances. Then I think, ""If I was so smart, I would've asked how much this single payment is.""

&amp;#x200B;

And then it occurs to me, ""what If I'm being played?"" Normally wouldn't you tell me how much this great deal costs? I could call this guy to get 5 years of internet only to let him and his goons in my place and they just rob my shit. I get paranoid. My mind tries to remember his car, *it's a white minivan*? Fuck you memory. I look around as I walk home, search for vehicles that fit the description, and I see one driving by. I look in the front seats, I don't remember if he was driving or his wife and honestly this car could be anybody, but if it keeps going in my direction I could be being followed.

&amp;#x200B;

I just told a stranger that I live with just my Mom, I work a job at a place that you can assume pays well and is a good hour or so away, and how long I usually work there if called. If this was a movie I just gave plenty of valuable information to someone who, for all I know, already knows where I live and just needs to know when I'm in or out the house. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then I imagine what If this is true? What if he's just a scam artist trying to get by on idiots like me to support his family? I start to feel bad, damn sympathy. What if I'm just thinking too much and I just received a free Quesadilla, some cash and water? Maybe this guy is honest and I try to think from a business standpoint, or at least the big-brain stuff in movies. Why would you invest money in some rando? You're spending only a couple of dollars in the face of potentially a hundred(s) and he's probably already successfully used this business tactic on others. 

&amp;#x200B;

These ideas bounce around in my head and though I know that this isn't a movie but you never know with people. Anything could happen. My own life has a plenty of movie tropes loaded in it. I even ended the night watching as an old lady was crossing the street and contemplating whether I should help her, of course instantly thinking of how awkward that'd be(especially if she said no) and that this isn't a movie.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** I gave a some of semi-private information to a stranger and now might fall victim to a robbery because I can't lie. However I'm probably just being paranoid.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. Internet Guy, If you're reading this please forgive me for judging you, I am really fucking paranoid and stupid, and paranoid about my stupid actions. Also that Quesadilla was amazing and beats Taco Bell 1000 times, I need to start going to more authentic food vendors.",20Jul2019,1
51,"For the past 2 years I'd dedicate my time switching between different competitive video games, trying to improve as strategically and ""zen mindset"" as possible. I'm not really sure what I was looking for, probably just an ego boost to cover up my insecurities since I've hated myself for as long as I can remember. Setting near impossible goals and having absurd expectations for myself just so I could put everything in life aside to reach them. All of it means nothing to me. I can't take any of those skills further because I lose interest in the games. And now, the few games that I've been switching between over these past two years are boring as dick. No surprise there. Why not do something that doesn't involve gaming? I can't. I have no idea where to start. I'd be willing to try new things but I've mostly vetoed all the things that would be practical to try out (guitar, tv, socializing, art). I'm not willing to change but I want to. I don't know either.

52,"I wish it was easier. I want to love my mom and have a normal mother daughter relationship, but it's so hard.

I suffer from BPD. So does my mom. Although I am extremely high-functioning, I resent her for it all. The potential genetic links as well as my upbringing that has contributed to it. I feel bad for her having it, but I also resent her for leaving me with all these issues. A lacking sense of stability, flinching whenever somebody moves their hand too fast or raises their voice, just a lot of things that have built up into my flaws and insecurities. Yes, it's my problem too, but I just... resent her. For it. So much.

I want her and my father to get a divorce. They're not happy. I thought that all marriages meant pain, constant arguing, personal attacks etc, until I looked to my friends' parents as examples. They actually communicate and show some kind of affection for each other. My parents just seem like resentful roommates. I think my dad's cheating on my mom, or at least emotionally. I hate how my mom sort of knows, and tells me about her suspicions, but never does shit about it unless its to bring it up in the middle of a fight to put herself on a moral high ground.

I hate how she tells me to never trust men. She says men are bad, untrustworthy, are only here to deflower me. She tells me to trust no one but her, because only she loves me like this. It hurts. She says when she dies, no one will love me like she does. When we fight, she keeps threatening to killing herself or dying real soon. Its always fucking lies. She's just fucking manipulative.

I remember once I was crying about how I thought had failed a test, and it was like all her feelings just turned off. She just said... ""Good. I'm glad you failed."". She turned cold. Ice cold. And that's her, either fiery and filled with anger, screaming at the top of her lungs, or cold and indifferent.

I hate when she cries. I hate when she shows genuine weakness and insecurity because I've just become so numb to it. I hate talking to her, she makes me feel like a sociopath because I've just completely shut down all my feelings towards her except for anger. I keep trying to show acts of love and compassion but its fucking effort. I don't give a fuck anymore. If she doesn't give a fuck about my feelings, why am I obligated to look after hers?

I'm a good person, I truly believe that. I try so hard in all my relationships, I have amazing strong connections, I try to understand other people's feelings, so it fucking hurts when I can't even be happy with my own mother. There are no good moments, only bearable ones.

She never seems happy. She never seems satisfied. Maybe if she's in a good mood, she'll say something shallowly positive, but otherwise I feel this deep and oozing stress, anxiety, in her, that just makes me so so sad.

 She is lost and unhappy, trapped in a better time when she was young and beautiful. She has huge issues with appearance. She's old now, fifty something, whilst I'm at the peak of my beauty. And she sees it. She resents me for it, because I look like her when she was young. Almost an exact replica. And she hates that. She hates that I'm young and happy and have zest for life, while she... no one on the street catcalls her, boys don't constantly hit her up... all that... she misses that, I can tell... and she looks so sad. She would be so pretty if she smiled more., but her face is permanently etched in a frown.

Mama I love you but you hurt so bad. I just want her to get better and be happy. I know my resentment towards her is irrational and stupid because it's not her fault, but I'm just so fucking angry about it all the time.

This is just a rant. I don't know. My heart hurts every time I see her distant and forlorn expression. I just wish she was happy. I'm going to move out soon so I don't have to see her sad face every single day. I dont know. My heart hurts.",20Jul2019,2

After he told me, I immediately went to “you should quit drinking, dress better and act more confident” as advice and he reacted with pure exasperation, bordering on anger (not like him at all).

After talking to my wife and sister-in-law, they brought up incels. I’d heard the word but I couldn’t define what they were or what they believed, so I went online and started googling. At first, I was scared because most of what I found was basically incel=evil/perverted/school shooter etc. So I decided, screw it, and went onto the incel subreddit and asked for their advice. And they responded, in both thread posts and private messages.

They said they dealt with their problems through things like gaming, programming, making music, solitary outdoor activities, reading, writing, going to the gym and setting goals to do better at whatever they were working on etc. So, I went to my brother and we had a chat. 

We went over a lot of things, and I suggested he try his hand at making some of his own music because he always loved electronic music but never considered making it himself. I've also started taking him fishing with me and my son, and this morning he told me he’s going on fishing forums and is going to start to fish on his own, that he's really getting into it. He’s actually picked up new hobbies and has set some goals, which seems to be helping his mental state. 

I thought he just had to work on his looks and maybe try some counselling for his depression, and when he was hostile to those suggestions I was at a loss. Maybe i'm just dense, but it didn't occur to me to encourage him to just distract himself with activities, and while it's still very early (I'm not saying everything's going to be great from here on out,) I'm honestly so relieved to see him actually *wanting* to leave the house and do things.

Before all that happened, he was helpful to me and would hang out with me after he would only have sex with me if he was drunk and ignore me the rest of the time. He would never want to talk to me only about sex.



He left for the military over the years he kept in contact with me and saw me when he came home sometimes. He would only want to talk to me about sex or photos. He cheated on his girlfriend with me (I didn't know they were dating). He would have sex with me and ignore me. I went on vacation once, and my phone broke. He sent me at least 30 messages and was mad I didn't respond.



He would also imply that I'm weird or annoying. When I was 17, I tried talking to him about trouble I was having at school. At first, he was sympathetic but then told me to speak to someone else. Because of what happened I was bullied in school, I tried to talk to him because I was lonely . After three years knowing him, he told me he wanted me for sex and nothing more.



That he felt no connection to me. It's been four years since all that, and I feel broken. He still tries to contact me trying to cheat on his girlfriend with me or see me again. I try to ignore him then he'll bombard me with texts it works to face time me. I moved away and didn't talk to anyone he knows. He still keeps photos of me and sends them to me, asking if I miss this. I feel so used and dirty. Something must be so wrong with me.

My sister expects me to go get my nails done with her which is going to be around $30 today. I wanna die. I know I'll be okay, I guess I just wanted to rant about my own stupidity...

65,"Kinda just need to throw this out and vent. I’m with this incredible guy right now, he continues to surprise me in every way and is just super respectful about everything. It’s been great except that once while we were being intimate, I started to panic. 

We stopped, and then later in the day he said something (completely normal conversation btw) that just triggered a full-blown panic attack. Honestly, probably the worst I’ve ever had. Ever. I kept getting strange flashes of things that didn’t make sense and forgot where I was. I had to ask him to remind me who he  was, where I was, and that “he couldn’t get me.” (But idk who ‘He’ is). He was able to help me calm down but I don’t think it’s normal to have such an intense reaction, right? 

The last person I was with asked if something had happened to me, and my response was always “not that I know of.” But I did have strange moments then, too. And now that I’m with someone else and we’re experimenting, I’m starting to think that something happened to me as a kid. I don’t know what, or when, or how, but I’m worried that something really really bad happened and I blocked it from my mind. 

I want to know what it is if that’s the case, but do I really?? I don’t know. Like, it’s just blank. I try to think of things that might’ve gone wrong but it’s just... blank. Yet I have these incredibly strong reactions to things I shouldn’t.

67,"Just laying awake thinking about this like I do a lot. I’m a waitress but my dream is to be an archaeologist. Or as close to one as I can be. 

I went to college but didn’t apply myself because I was struggling with the lovely anxiety/depression combo. I dropped out twice but finally earned a general Bachelor of Arts with no minor after 5 years and 2 universities. 

At the first school I was majoring in anthropology and minoring in Spanish. I was so good at Spanish in high school but it got “too hard” in college so I gave up, cause that’s what I do. I really regret that. My second university didn’t have an anthropology major so I just picked the easiest degree and did the bare minimum of what I had to do to graduate. 

Since then I’ve been working in restaurants because I don’t know what to do next. I really never wanted to set foot in another classroom but lately I’ve been missing college even though I remember the stress all too well. People always say to follow your dreams and I don’t want to look back and regret not taking the chance because I regret FAR too much in my life already. 

I’m seriously considering going through the trouble of taking out loans and getting my Master’s and going to field school for archaeology. But I’m not sure anywhere would take me because my undergrad GPA was not great. I can’t remember exactly, but it must have been a 2-point-something. I did get a couple A’s, but mostly B’s, C’s and a few D’s. At one point I was on academic probation. 

Even if I do get accepted somewhere, I’m also worried my mental illness will act up as it does and I’ll fail or give up. And I think beneath that, part of me just doesn’t believe I’m smart enough to do it. 

My younger sister (who I’m extremely proud of btw) is getting a Bachelor’s in computer science right now and is killing it. It’s not easy for her but she really works hard and succeeds. I wish I was like that. I feel like I just fumble through life, one mistake to the next. I’m getting close to 30 and I’m still working the same crappy jobs I did in high school because nothing else I’m qualified for is appealing.

I used to need that.

Let’s say some rich person makes it. There’s no people to sell to, to sustain their status. Without us average/poor folks then there’s no “society “. 

Let’s put aside the money factor. If everyone is dead and money is no longer usable how are they going to sustain themselves to live? If they’re rich odds are they can’t survive without buying things aka no survival skills. 

Now the gov, what point is it to make it through if you have literally no one to govern? Let’s say the president is the only one to make it “oh hey, I made it, lemme go to my office” “oh wait I have nothing left”

So I have a quite traumatic past. Mom telling me stories about her being raped by dad and how sex is the worst thing ever. Together with this comes a whole self esteem issue and I'm quite hairy, so being naked with someone else makes me uncomfortable anyway. Also I have never been in a relationship my whole life, so I've never found anyone I felt comfortable enough with. 

Now a few years ago I had sex for the first time - I was severely depressed and ready to die, but I figured dying a virgin was a shame so why not try it out. So had sex with a guy I had zero connection with and it just hurt, I wasn't in to it. Had sex a few times with him, I figured it should get better, but it didn't. So since then I decided I'd go back to old strategy of finding someone I have a connection with.

Well I guess I am starting to think I'm never going to find someone. I'm turning 25 soon and I've been alone my whole life. Everyone has these romantic experiences from when they were younger, and here I am just afraid of having sex and not being able to find anyone I feel connected with. It's starting to get to me.

So I tried out 2 dating apps in the past weeks and honestly they are terrible haha, just guys looking for sex. I found one guy I actually had a connection with, only he isn't ready for any type of commitment. I explained to him my past (just a bit) and he thinks that I am over romanticising it. And now I'm just starting to think that maybe I'm in the wrong and I'm never going to find anyone like this. Is it necessary to let loose a bit more to find someone? I honestly just want someone I have a connection with in real life and that knows my past and have multiple dates before jumping into bed. I'm starting to feel I should let go and hope sex will feel better? But at the same time I am extremely scared to just have sex with someone. Am I doomed for a life alone?

# Colleages and managers

Companies are merely schools. People never grow up.

I resigned from my roles twice exactly after earnt salary appraisals or flexible schedules, being constantly humillated or stressed by some colleage. In such situation and not handling stress, cry just in front of my managers was a topic.

During my last job, we managed to move into a fancy office using the money earned by a single project. This project supossed to be finished by 2 developers in 6 months and was HUGE.

I built the whole thing working solo 6-7 days a week for 3 months and asked for an appraisal. My manager partially refused, we argued and he asked me -doors open- if I though he can't hire two low-paid workers to do my job.

Again, I resigned.

# Immigration officers

Next, I decided to move with my savings to an affordable country (X), getting job interviews in the nearest country (Y) and flying in-out every time because (Y) was too expensive to move in w/o job.

If you tell people you fly to talk with them 30 minutes, they don't believe nor answer you. My whole year and my money flew out after send hundreds of mails, get pitty replies and barely 5 interviews.

I got deported because too much ins-outs and bounced back from (Y) to (X) and from (X) to my home country. This is a whole post by itself as all this bouncing process happened in less than a week at my own cost.

The IOs retained my passport and -again- humillated me in front of strangers, attaching me a ""nanny"" until I got into the airplane and making me feel like a criminal because of trying to get the life I wanted.

# Business people

The very story of my present looks like this, it happened two days ago.

Now I'm creating and trying to sell robots and machines, as soon as I got a reply we scheduled a phone call. I researched this guy and started feeling nervous, so I went for a walk to answer on my way.

It turned into a 1 hour walk. Nobody called. I kindy sent a reminder. He postponed the call for the next hour. It turned into a 3 hours walk. He ignored me. Head down and back home.

Same story about business people who ""clapped"" when I was doing good in my past. Now they don't give a F.

Hilarious too when any -apparently- wealth guy ask for your salary expectations. Smokebomb.

# Psicologists

I visited a psicologist for first time in my life last week.

This person spent an hour giving me a business class. Not even a single tip into handle my situation but to ""find investors"" and now I don't really know if I'm dissapointed or I fucked up her mind too.

# Advise?

I lost everything -including job+couple combos- a few times before. Always moved to another place and got further, but this time for some reason I'm unable to make a single penny.

I've been unemployed for over a year and a half, I'm feeling totally useless and -over all- invisible. My sister told me to find a job into a supermarket, but honestly it's kinda heart broken if I look at my skills and the life I lived.

There wasn’t a day I didn’t have Discovery Channel, Nat Geo or Animal Planet on my tv. I wasn’t your typical kid that loved cartoons, I LOVED animals, watching animals and learning about animals. When I was 4 I told my mom I wanted to be a Veterinarian when I grow up. Since then, I’ve spent my whole life around animals like I’ve always wanted. I’ve volunteered at shelters, wildlife preserver and working at dog boarding places. Since I’ve grown more and realized everything a vet does, like putting animals down.... I knew my heart wouldn’t be able to handle it. I liked watching animals living, in their beauty and just being free. Though I know animals die, I just don’t wanna be the hands that make that decision. So I kept thinking more and more about what I wanted to do. I knew I still wanted to do something with animals, I could never just not follow my dreams. 

When I was 18 years old, I married my high school sweet heart that I’ve known since 3rd grade and he LOVED my passion for animals. He supported me and he always let me know it, he told me to always follow my heart and so I did. He joined the US Navy and we got stationed in Lemoore California. I applied for Animal Behavior College to be a dog trainer and I loved it! It was so much fun to learn dog behavior and teaching them all kinds of things, learning how to be in control. But.... it wasn’t what I wanted to do my whole life, I loved it and I was working with animals, but I was missing something. I was still not satisfied. So looking for jobs in California was impossible, I was 19 with very little work experience but I knew I was a hard worker. I noticed on the Naval Base Facebook page that everyone was offering to baby sit other families children but no one was offering to watch other families pets. What did people do with their pets? Take them to a kennel? I’ve worked in a boarding kennel, I know how unhappy dogs are in there. How stressed out they get to the point where they dehydrate or starve themselves for days in end till their owners come back. I decided to start offering pet sitting in other people’s homes and in my home on base. I got full support from my husband, from my friends and it became a really big hit. Eventually everyone on base knew about me, officers, chiefs and more! I was in it for the long haul and I absolutely fell in LOVE with pet sitting. I was getting amazing feedback for caring for other people’s pets, they loved how happy their pets were and safe. They loved that I gave them updates, I sent pictures and videos and I let them always know how their pets were doing. I have pets and I know what I’d want for my babies so I just wanted to give other people that same piece of mind. 

My husband got out of the Navy in 2017 and we moved back home to our small town in East Texas. I got a job as a server with my sister at a sports bar and it definitely helped get us somewhat on our feet. My husband had fallen into a deep depression. He went into the military at such a young age, he didn’t know how to function when he got out and he missed it a lot. I knew I had to be there for my husband. I knew that all the times he’s supported me and picked me up when I’ve given up, I had to do the same for him now. He looked for job after job and everywhere told him he was overqualified. He was at a loss, he said he didn’t care he just needed a job but no one ever hired him. I decided it was time for me to start my pet sitting again and work two jobs, so I did. I relocated my Facebook business page ‘Emery’s Dog House’ to serving our hometown location. It was extremely slow at first but that was okay cause it was various sports season at work and it was time to make those tips! Once football season ended, I knew it was time to promote my pet sitting more and start getting clients. I signed up with Rover and they got my foot in the door but I was still pretty slow because people still would’ve rather taking their pets to kennels or pay for luxury pet hotels. When I already did pretty much all those things plus MORE for a much better price and more reassurance. I saved any money I could because we were living with my husbands parents at the time, we both felt pretty worthless. Some months pass by and we go to California to visit my husbands uncle to see if he could get a job working in a warehouse with his uncle. We were there for 5 days and it was looking pretty good so far, we were getting excited. Then, my husband was told by an old friend from the Navy that he was working in Alaska now as a military contractor and told him to apply. My husband and I weren’t sure about Alaska but I told him there had to be other military contracting jobs all over the US. We were out to eat waiting to go back to the Los Angeles Airport, talking about our future and if we were both doing what we wanted. My husband decided to search military contracting jobs, doing the same thing he was doing while in the Navy. Behold, he found his EXACT job as a civilian contractor in Meridian Mississippi. We thought, where in the world is Meridian Mississippi? To our knowledge, apparently we had passed through the highway there SO many times before when my husband was in service. We looked it up and saw it was only 7 hours from our home town and didn’t think that was too bad at all! My husband applied for the job immediately!! After finishing lunch, we headed to LAX to wait and board our flight back home to Texas. Then, while dropping off our rental car at the airport... my husband gets a call. He says, “It says NAS Meridian on the caller ID... EMERY!!!!” I said, “OH MY GOD ANSWER!”. In a very cool voice my husband answers, trying to calm himself down, they told him they want to do a phone interview with him the very next day. He agrees, gets the time and ends the call. We start jumping up and down, so excited and in disbelief! It had only been an hour since he had applied online, they must have really liked his resume and his experience he had while in service. 

We couldn’t stop talking about it on the flight home, we both thought about it so hard. Once we got home my husband could barley sleep cause he was so happy! The next morning, he got a call an hour early from NAS Meridian. I said, “Brady!! Wake up!! They are calling you.” He sits right up and stares at the phone, clearing his throat, trying his best to sound like he’s awake! He answers, I go down stairs to tell his mother that he’s started his phone interview and we both just start smiling ear to ear. We wait patiently, he comes downstairs not even 15 minutes later and says, “They said they will call me back in a week to let me know.” Both me and his mother were so sure he got the job, we just knew it and I think he knew it, too! He went to go shower right after and I stayed downstairs talking to his mother about California. My husband was done with his shower in 30 minutes, ran down the stairs soaking wet in a towel! “Guess what?”, he said. “They called me while I was in the shower and said I got the job, I start in 3 weeks!” We all jumped up and down, celebrating and so happy for him! We immediately start looking for a rent house, we found a really great home in a very nice neighborhood in Meridian. Fast forward to moving day, it was perfect, we loved Mississippi and it felt like home so quickly to us. We didn’t know a single person there and I still had little work experience other than pet sitting and serving food. I knew I needed to know more people out there first before pet sitting and we needed money right away. I applied at another sports bar and it worked for a little bit but it was nothing like Texas tips. It was a huge tip decrease than what I was used to and I was extremely unhappy because the restaurant was always dead. I applied at another restaurant, it was a steakhouse and all my tips went away by the end of the night from tipping out the bartender, bus boy, host, etc. I was leaving with a minimum of $40 to $60 almost every night, even the weekends. I was very unhappy still. My husband started making really good money and going on lots of business trips so he told me to stop working for a month, so I did. 

A month passes by and I’m tired of feeling like a bum. I wanted to pet sit again and I wanted to do anything to start again. So, I relocated and opened my business Facebook page again. I started advertising on Facebook, NextDoor app, Rover, Craigslist and anything else I could find! I got a couple people from my husbands job and that was it... I was so disappointed. We were finally looking into buying a home in Meridian, after living here for a year, it was time! We got all moved into our new home and that where I really got down to business. I made business cards, fliers, brochures, t shirts, decals and everything you need to promote a business! I finally got in with a pilot, then another pilot and then another pilot... next thing I knew pilots were telling all their pilot friends about me. Other military spouses and officials were telling people about me, then my veterinarian was telling people about me! My business grew and started thriving SO big and I officially made it. I am a proud business woman of my own self made business that I worked incredibly hard for. The fact that I’ve achieved my goals is so amazing to me and I’ve made my whole family proud. I’m making money pet sitting more than I ever knew someone could make. I’m so beyond happy and though this is my job, it hardly feels like one because I enjoy doing it so much. I would do this job free if the world today wasn’t so hectic and adulting wasn’t so hard, haha! I’m here, I’ve found my passion and I’ve built it from the ground up. I don’t plan to stop here, I still have a long way to go for where I want my business to be but I’m so happy. I want everyone to work hard for themselves, chase your dreams NO MATTER how unrealistic you or other people say it is. Anything is possible, you just have to want it bad enough! Find something you love, something that you’re passionate about, and DO IT!",20Jul2019,3

I was there with my siblings and our mom standing in front of the grave missing something. But it wasn't my grandma, that i was missing, it was the feeling of missing her.
I can't very well describe what it feels like. These deaths didn't affect me emotionally. I didn't cry, I wasn't sad i didn't think about it very much. When our dog died, i cried, but it felt more like putting up an alibi so my family'd see i was sad about this loss.

113," So all my life, animals have been my passion. I know way too much about dogs, and ever since I worked at an animal shelter and started learning veterinary medicine to help some of the animals, I have dreamed of becoming a vet. I've been talking to schools and knew the amount of work it would take, but never knew how competitive it is. 

 I've never been good at school. I'm not dumb, but I'm definitely not a super bright person. So I find myself at age 26 depressed and upset that I have come to the realization that I honestly do not believe I would make it through school, and have no idea what to do now.

I’m a 20 year old male who has almost no luck with women.

I’ll admit I do have a problem making the first move but I do actively try to pursue women but it’s gotten to the point where I feel like now, no matter what, nobody who I am interested in (or otherwise) would ever share mutual feelings. I’ve tried online dating but every time I meet up with someone from said dating site they either look nothing like their photos, can’t hold a conversation beyond the point of one answer replies or both. I’ve had one night stands in the past but always feel empty the day after and I long for a real relationship. I feel like with each failure I’m inching closer to my breaking point and I’m currently hanging by a thread. Dying alone is a scary thought to have for anyone I would assume, but at this point in time I don’t see how I won’t. Any advice on how I can break this cycle would be a god send.

115,"**Note this is a throwaway account.**

During the last few years I managed to turn a modest background w/o education or work experience into a nice lifestyle. Dropped high school, educated myself in arts and technology and got high paid jobs in top cities around the world.

Sounds good? Better keep reading.

# Colleages and managers

Some companies are merely schools. People never grow up.

I resigned from my roles twice exactly after earnt salary appraisals or flexible schedules, being constantly humillated or stressed by some colleage. In such situation and not handling stress, cry just in front of my managers was a topic.

During my last job, we managed to move into a fancy office using the money earned by a single project. This project supossed to be finished by 2 people in 6 months and was HUGE.

I built the whole thing working solo 6-7 days a week for 3 months and asked for an appraisal. My manager partially refused, we argued and he asked me -doors open- if I though he can't hire two low-paid workers to do my job.

Again, I resigned.

# Immigration officers

Next, I decided to move with my savings to an affordable country (X), getting job interviews in the nearest country (Y) and flying in-out every time because (Y) was too expensive to move in w/o job.

If you tell people you fly to talk with them 30 minutes, they don't believe nor answer you. My whole year and my money flew out after send hundreds of mails, get pitty replies and barely 5 interviews.

I got deported because too much ins-outs and bounced back from (Y) to (X) and from (X) to my home country. This is a whole post by itself as all this bouncing process happened in less than a week at my own cost.

The IOs retained my passport and -again- humillated me in front of strangers, attaching me a ""nanny"" until I got into the airplane and making me feel like a criminal because of trying to get the life I wanted.

# Business people

The very story of my present looks like this, it happened two days ago.

Now I'm creating and trying to sell robots and machines, as soon as I got a reply we scheduled a phone call. I researched this guy and started feeling nervous, so I went for a walk to answer on my way.

It turned into a 1 hour walk. Nobody called. I kindy sent a reminder. He postponed the call for the next hour. It turned into a 3 hours walk. He ignored me. Head down and back home.

Same story about some business people who clapped when I was doing good. Now they don't give a F as I asked for help and got totally ignored.

# Professional help

I visited a psicologist for first time in my life last week.

This person spent an hour giving me a business class. Not even a single tip into handle my situation but to ""find investors"" and now I don't really know if I'm dissapointed or I fucked up her mind too.

# Any advise?

My life savings blew out trying to fit, so now I'm broke. I've been unemployed for over a year and a half, I'm feeling totally useless and -over all- invisible. My sister told me to find a job into a supermarket, but honestly it's kinda heart broken if I look at the life I lived.

I don't really want to live here or have real friends in this place. I spend my whole day sleeping while my computer send emails abroad, sometimes walking on nature and trying to exercise as my doctor told me: pills or workout.

116,"College professor here.

&amp;#x200B;

I have two classes this semester: one is Java programming, and the other is more theoretical and not the topic of discussion here. The Java program is admittedly difficult (I had trouble learning the subject matter myself) but I always make it very clear to my students in every class I teach:

&amp;#x200B;

\- The point of this isn't to just get the highest mark, I want you to understand the material

\- I am here to help you, because I have job experience and I know what is required

\- Most programming jobs will give you a coding test as part of the application process, so cheating is not a good idea.

&amp;#x200B;

Part of my work's definition of Academic dishonesty is what's called ""Unauthorized Collaboration."" Basically, it's fine to help your peers, but you can't give them answers. When it comes to code, you can't copy and paste formulae to each other.

&amp;#x200B;

I had several cases of this on an assignment, gave a stern lecture to the class about what UC was and gave them a short grace window to re-upload any assignments where they think they may have done this, without consequence.

&amp;#x200B;

I am now marking these assignments. I have 35 students in this class and I have 8 cases of UC.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Variable names unchanged

\- Line for line code duplication

&amp;#x200B;

And the tip off:

\- They forgot to remove the comment that said //By Student McLastName//

&amp;#x200B;

So I started digging.

&amp;#x200B;

Not only did those students commit unauthorized collaboration among their fellow peers, I found evidence that at least \*20 students\* had copied from a previous graduate (whom I had last semester, and recognized the name.)

&amp;#x200B;

I am launching an investigation, and feel like I'm on the precipice of getting several students in a lot of trouble, even kicked out of the program.

&amp;#x200B;

119,"I don't know why I'm just so goddamn stupid. Like when it comes to everything I'm just so fucking dumb. I used to take Piano CM, Certificate of Merit test annually, and it's basically playing tests and written test on music theory. And I don't know why I just can't get music theory no matter how I try or who explains it. I've had three piano teachers already. I just don't understand cadences and chord progression or the modulations no matter how hard I try, even though my other friends are able to get it, and even after they explain it I still have trouble remembering it all. And in my middle school biology class, I can do fine studying but on the actual test I get Cs while the friends who I studied with get As. I retook a test and got the same score, a C. I also take french, and when a new topic is introduced I feel like I can get what the teacher is saying. But when I review my notes later, it's like I'm fucking illiterate, and on tests I just forget all the grammar and tenses and shit. However, for me, the worst of all is math. I'm so shit at math. It took me fucking FOREVER to understand trigonometry and I just can't get myself to understand like polynomials and piecewise functions and I fucking hate myself for it. I look up fucking coolmath explanations and still don't get it. And factoring, I just can't get the shortcuts and the multiple of zero thing and I always have to do it the long way by drawing a grid.

I remember being the only one to get a perfect score on a math test in the third grade.
