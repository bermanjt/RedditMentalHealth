0,"This was a phrase that for some reason upset me when I was growing up. Now I came to realize it's because I've only ever heard ""women are just as good as men."" I'm ashamed that I use to get defensive to something so dumb.",22Oct2019,2
1,"Basically I turned 18 not too long ago and going off to college soon (may I add quite far away from my parents). Until now I have had pretty strict rules on just about everything except going out with friends cause I am not much of a party guy so I only go out once or twice a month for parties and like once or twice a week with friends (Even then I can't be home before 1ish). Since I was a kid I have always liked videogames, and I played them with some frequency. My grades were not affected, to be honest. Let me clarify that I think my mom and dad have the best intentions for me, but they go about it the wrong way. Since I was playing a lot they set time limits for my gaming, 2 hours on weekends including Friday. I was like 13 back then and it was absurd to me at the time, but because of my age, I could not do anything. Now it's a different story, I am 18 and I still have time limits, 3 hours on weekends and Friday. 3 fucking hours it's absurd. on top of that, they always took my phone at 10 pm, they only stopped this school year because I had to beg them. Point being, I never really had any self-control after that, any chance I got to play some extra time I would take it. And if my parents ever go out for a long period of time I really can't control myself. This kind of scares me because in college I won't have time limits and I will have to control myself, which I have not done in my whole life basically. Do any of you have any suggestions? I was thinking of trying to compromise something with my parents or at least tell them something but I don't know what to do.",22Oct2019,3
2,"Like if I'm 24 in 8 years, half my age is 12. But in 8 years, she'll be 16 not 12. I had originally posted this on r/showerthoughts, but an auto mod said I should post this here.",22Oct2019,17
4,"“I’m proud of you.” It was my doctor when I told her I quit smoking. And then it hit me how no one has said it to me in a very long time. My mom would, if she was still alive. Lately I’ve been feeling like no one is really there for me. Like I don’t have that person who would drop what they’re doing to come help if I need to. I stress myself out to the point of getting sick to help other people and usually all I get in return is them walking out of my life. 

I’m just so tired. And sad. And tired of being sad. I try to be the best person I can be. Yet I’ve had such a hard time in life. I see people who I know are just huge jerks, get blessing after blessing. I know, I know...you don’t always know what goes on beyond closed doors. But still. And the ONE person I gave a shit about was unfairly and suddenly ripped away from me. I never took her for granted and I even said anything could happen to me as long as I had her. Let me tell you, saying life has been a shitshow since then is an understatement. 

Just feeling down and frustrated today. Feeling like any good I’ve tried to do is useless. Feeling like I’m never good enough at teaching and someone is always criticizing me. Everything feels so hard all the time, especially with chronic illness and not one single soul willing to help. Today just feels like my heart broke all over again. I was doing so well, but I felt it all building up at the same time. I’m just tired of figuring things out. Just tired. Needed to get it out...Le sigh. 

Wishing you all peace, love, and kindness along your journey.",22Oct2019,3
5,Recent years I’ve found I’m losing more and more of my memories right in front of me!! Occasionally I’ll have times where for a brief hour I’ll remember a ton of stuff I forgotten but then it goes away. When writing it down it doesn’t help because the emotion is gone and you can’t remember it just from writing. Is there a way to store all these memories without them being erased? Or is me learning new memories sacrificing the old ones?,22Oct2019,2
6,"I work with kids and I have for a few years. For whatever reason (maybe my experience, idk) every new job I've gotten, I've been given the tougher cases and tougher kids and they take a toll on my mental health. I've tried explaining this at each job that it is difficult going to work when I have such high anxiety when working with the tougher kids. Now, my current job I am literally being assaulted by a child every single day. I keep being applauded for sticking with it and reassured that I will be given easier cases after I'm off of this one and that this is not typical with my job. I just don't understand why I would be given a tough case when I'm new on the job. Every person I started with got easier cases than I did. Why does this always happen?",22Oct2019,2
7,"I would like to explain this as succinctly as possible, but although it is not complex, I feel that it will be extended.

I'm 23 years old, I'm from Argentina and in the last few months I started to feel a little strange.

I feel like I lost my motivation for things, but regardless of whether I like what I do or not, I want to give it a little depth.

I study online, work and have a relatively successful Internet retail business that I created at only 18 years of age. In the last 13 months I've been traveling the world and I could even afford to buy many things I wanted. I come from an economically very complicated country and from a working middle class family, but nevertheless I could have opportunities to do a lot of things. Today I feel that I don't fully enjoy what I do and that many things I do automatically. 

On the other hand I also have a girlfriend and friends but I feel that there is ""something else"" in life that I am missing (maybe it is FOMO). I know I'm young, but sometimes I also wonder if it's worth trying SO much on some things, people studying and preparing 15 years to buy a small house in a chaotic city in another 10-15 years, the same old conversations everywhere, the same jokes, the same celebrities, I find it hard to find something deep, an experience that takes me off the beaten track.

I know that maybe I confuse economic motivation with intrinsic motivation, but I'm not even attracted by the idea of consuming things anymore and it makes me wonder why I'm running a business? or what do people do when they feel that way?

On the other hand I got tired of seeing a society so synthetic, so artificial, where everyone wants to look good in Instagram and already, people fighting over politics or football.

All this is super abstract, but I wanted to know if it had happened to anyone. To sum up, I'm not motivated by what I do but I also feel that if I do something higher maybe it's not even worth it, sometimes I think about creating new things or continue entrepreneurship but I get stuck and stay in comfort, it's worth making a difference? Maybe when I was a kid I saw with better eyes to try to have ""financial freedom"" today I simply think about how to be happier, today I have money and I'm not happy.

It was the first time I've cheated and it was awesome! At this time, I don't feel guilty, I feel great!",22Oct2019,0
9,"After struggling with a lifetime of abuse and neglect and issues from PTSD, BPD, depression and anxiety, I lost it. 6 months ago I went into a depressive episode. I lost all my fiends, my job, and my housing. It was 110° daily with the humidity super high, I couldn’t afford to run my car 24/7 and I couldn’t live in it without the A/C. Finally after a couple weeks my girlfriends family led me live in there back yard in a [tent](https://imgur.com/a/DGpXvWP). I had to pay the difference in electric and had to provide my own food/shower/ resources. I had to sell all of my things just to afford gas money, and I literally mean all of my things- 70” flat screen tv I just bought for my sled xmas present. My bed. My kitchen table, my brand new living room set, literally everything. 

I had a shitty job record and I couldn’t find a job to save my life. I did everything short of begging on my hands and knees for a job- no one wanted me. I have many years of hotel experience so I applied to on of the chains in my town that I’ve applied to before- I put in my resume that I promised not to let her down, and she hired me. 

I’ve worked my ass off. Everyday. I started as a housekeeper which I said I’d never do. I’m strictly front desk- but I was too desperate. I worked my ass off for a month doing something I hated with a passion. I finally got bad on some medication to manage my mental health, got a new primary care doctor, and had someone on my side. 

A little while later I was promoted to some front desk shifts- again working my ass off like I never have before. It was only part time but it was something. After all no one else wanted me. After about 4 months , I am finally full time front desk. I have a service dog I bring to my all my shifts which helps manage my disability greatly. 

After about 5 months I finally got accepted to rent a house. It’s super nice and I cannot believe I did this. Is has 3 bedrooms, 1.5 baths, and 2 living rooms. It’s bittersweet because I have literally nothing. I sold everything just to survive. I got a bed donated to me when I was living in the tent, other than that it was just my clothes. I had posted an add on Facebook asking for help with things and I’m so surprised with my community. That was really hard for me because I hate asking for handouts. I used to hate this town but within 2 days I have people wanting to donate kitchen tables and chairs, I got a whole dish set with like 40 plates and cups (granted they’re from the 70’s and from a dead lady but they work for me) I had two end tables donated to me, some winter clothes, some old towels, and some old bedding. Currently this is what my bedroom looks like: [Bedroom](https://imgur.com/a/pfSa4Sr).  It’s not much- well shit it isn’t anything at all but it beats being in a tent. And I’m thankful for that, and I’m so fucking proud of where I am and how far I’ve come. I just wish I had someone to tell.",22Oct2019,11
10,"Hey, I don’t know if anyone will read this and I don’t know why it matters. I feel like I need advice but at the same time it seems pointless. I’ve been on a kind of self-improvement / self-love mission in which I’ve recognized that there’s no point in hating myself, but I feel like I’m failing. I’m trying to be a better, nicer person who makes responsible decisions and treats people with respect, but I feel like no matter what I do I’m always letting people down, hurting people, and being a useless member of society. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, and I don’t know how to fix it. Every day I feel like I’m digging myself deeper into increasingly depressing hole and I don’t know how to stop. How do I make myself a better person and stop feeling like this?

I don’t know if context helps, but I’m 22F and yes I am seeing a therapist. I dropped out of school because I failed out of my program and I’m planning on going back next year, I’m just working and saving up. I hate my job, I feel like I’m the laughing stock of my work and I’ve even fucked things up with people who are nice to me. I barely have any friends, but I have a really awesome and supportive girlfriend and I’m so in love with her. I’ve never been in love before. I was in a relationship with a man in my late teens and we lived together for two years but it never felt like this. He was my best friend and my biggest supporter but at the same time I hated him and I was so angry. I was a terrible person in my teens, I couldn’t cope with my family circumstances and took my pain out on myself, him, and a few other people. I self harmed, had violent sex, had sex with married men, and I felt so fucking empty. Nothing was good enough and I hated myself and everyone else. My partner was my best friend but I never loved him, I just couldn’t bear being alone. I tried breaking up with him a few times because I was so frustrated but we never left each other and I don’t know why, but it clearly wasn’t working. I’ve always felt so sexually dysfunctional and like the only way I could feel anything was if it was reckless and painful. I’m sorry, this is a mess.

I did realize how fucked up my relationship was and I did manage to end it. I felt and feel awful for how I behaved, but I continued to act out in the ways I listed above and that’s what led to me dropping out of school. I was and I’ve been trying to change but I was still so fucking lost.

Then I met my girlfriend. She’s perfect and I feel like I don’t deserve her. I can’t even describe in words how wonderful she is, the world is a cruel place to make someone so beautiful amongst all the ugly, hateful people. I’m fucking crying writing this like a stupid baby, I don’t know how someone so lovely is in my life and I’m so grateful but I still feel so hopeless and horrible. I don’t want to hurt her or anyone else but I feel like I’m a waste of space. I thought I knew what it felt like to be in love and like I was wrong or my ex partner was gay or I don’t know what I thought. I’m experiencing sex that isn’t frustrating (/totally infuriating/painful) and intimacy that feels deep and real and I want to marry her. I didn’t even think monogamy was possible. I thought everyone saw women the way I did but I never thought a woman could see me that way. I tried so hard to be desirable to men but then I never wanted the attention and that’s so fucked up. I was having sex with someone and they said “one day you’re going to find a man who will love you and own you and use you” and all I did was cry and say that it would be a woman and I have no idea why I said that or why I ever put myself in that situation. What’s wrong with me? Why did I have sex with horrible people? I had sex with really nice men but it was so boring. I had sex with really horrible men and it was so traumatic. I’m so grateful to be where I am now and I’m so glad that part of my life is over but I feel like my past is too much of a burden. My therapist says I need to let it go and forgive myself and I’m trying but sometimes I feel like I haven’t changed. Like I’m still a hateful, horrible, stupid, embarrassing person that makes terrible, destructive decisions.


Like if I know I’m selfish and an idiot and that it’s in my power to change that, why haven’t I been successful? Please help me. I’m so embarrassed by how self pitying and angsty this sounds, but I really don’t know what to do. I can barely afford therapy and I know I’ve made progress but I still feel like I should just die or something. Like my life is over and I’m never going to amount to anything. I can’t deal with my sexuality and I keep trying to act like it isn’t an issue but I don’t know what the fuck is wrong with me. I keep crying during and / or after sex because I’m in disbelief of how good this is. Like I don’t deserve it and I can’t be gay because that’s disrespectful to gay people. I’m at work and I just want to quit. I want to go back to school but I need to work for at least a few more months. Why am I such a mess? I feel like I need a friend but I don’t want to be a burden, I can’t talk about this to anyone in my life because I don’t want to make them feel bad. Please help me, what do I do?",22Oct2019,1

14,"   Honestly I love my boyfriend so much, unconditionally and completely. But it's obvious to me that... We just aren't good for each other. I don't blame him at all. He's sweet and kind and does what he can to be a successful person and I always just throw fits that he doesn't want to be around me at all. 
   We see each other around every two to three weeks, and he works during normal weekdays so I usually dont talk to him during those times because he gets irritated. Normally we only say good morning and good night to each other and during the weekends he's usually busy so I have to arrange for him to come over a few weeks ahead. 
   When we do spend time together he likes to play video games and watch netflix or Hulu. I cant say it doesnt irritate me a little when he plays games though because he does that when he comes home on weekdays and he wont even play a game /with/ me. 
   He says I complain too much, and that he wishes I wouldnt throw fits so often but I can't really help it i dont think. I have severe depression and anxiety, and I dont have any friends besides him.

I never drank because I enjoyed it I drank because I just didn't want to be sober in this dark fucking world I was in the army when I was 19-20 I was a medic I don't sleep well sometimes. I recently quit cigarettes also I started smoking when I was in Iraq again more of a habit than a craving I decided the other morning to stop and I did. I've been having some realizations lately that the way I think is not the way most people think and I've lost some friends over it well them being shitty and me pointing out that I remember every aspect of whatever shitty thing it is I am supposed to let them do to me? I'm very happy I'm more calm than I've ever felt in my life and part of the reason why is the way I look at things has changed by choice.

18,"\*controversial opinion\* I miss my college schedule. The freedom, the flexibility, the relatively well defined goals and openness to do them however I wanted. When I entered the workforce, one of the first feelings I remember experiencing was how oppressive being in an office for 45-60 hours a week felt. It feels utterly unnatural and inherently less productive. 

I was a dumb kid coming out of high school. I had terrible study habits and got pretty abysmal grades. I ended up finding a deep interest in biochemistry my senior year and dedicated myself to becoming a better learner. As a result, I spent a great deal of time learning about learning - time structuring and study habits (big shout out to Cal Newport) and I am happy to say it paid off big time in a somewhat unconventional way. 

During the middle of my Junior year of college I got in a ski accident forcing me to drop all of my classes. As a result my Senior year was puh-acked to the brim with all of my most challenging classes. On top of that I was working two part time jobs, worked for the school newspaper and volunteered 3 hours a week. It was more than I could chew, but only slightly, and I got through the damn thing.

One of the things I miss the most is that no single cognitively demanding task ever forced me to stay in one location for more than an hour or two tops. Of course there were the 3 and 4 hour labs, however, I was able to get them all on the same day. It was a brutal day, sure, but I was able to delineate it mentally from the rest of my work which gave me some peace of mind.

My life was built around my crycadian rhythm. 

7am-2:30pm was absorbing time. learn as much as I could any which way I could. Lecture, reading, compiling my notes. open it up and pack it all in. 

2:30-4pm was sacred time. fuck around with my friends and a mandatory nap to end it with. the goal here was to reduce the allosteric stress that had built up from the morning and reset my brain for the rest of the day. 

4-5pm workout or volunteer depending on the day

5-9pm work 

9-12am was producing time. Homework, papers, lab write ups, problem sets. Anything that involved application of the ideas I had learned in the morning. Sometimes this would be social, sometimes in complete isolation. 

also inherent in this were major changes of scenery and almost pavlovian type responses to being in them. When I sat down in the corner seat in the library it was like my brain was automatically thrust into learning mode. When I sat down at my desk that was hidden in my closet, its like the pieces of my thoughts were already coming together to solve that problem I was assigned earlier in the week. Heck I am clumsy as a hell but the second I would step into lab I turned into some sort of coordinated pipet wielding ballerina. 

Also the timers! everything was timed in 50 minute chunks. I would reflect for a minute about how I would like to focus for that time period and what I was hoping to accomplish and then BOOM locked in. Every hour on the hour I was getting feedback about how well I was doing at life. Sometimes it would be good sometimes not but it was introspection regardless and I cherished those moments afterwards of reflecting on why I was doing everything and how well I did.

I suppose this is a rant more than anything else. I was really proud with what I had accomplished in that time. The way I had found out how much better I could preform with a mid day nap followed by intense exercise. How much of a difference it made focusing on one type of cognitive function in the morning and then switching to another one at night. When I think about it, more so than the challenging material itself, the act of learning how to manage my time, brain power, attention, and wakefulness is what I would consider the accomplishment in those four years. 

When it comes to pretty much any test of intelligence I am remarkably average (at best). The kids in my classes were/are such phenomenally hard workers and smart as the day is long.  The only way I kept up was riding the waves of my days like a GD professional surfer. 

Then I got my first job out of college. 45 hours (minimum) a week in the same desk. Open office, no place to get away from it all. Phones ringing constantly. Manager sitting right next to me (it was a sales job). And I couldn't help but think how ineffective it all was. There's no pacing involved. just go go go. 

To compare it to running, I feel like I went from training for a marathon on scenic trails with a well thought out training plan involving periodization and intervals to training on a treadmill, where all I do is sprint for as long as I can before giving up. At a certain point, no matter how fast I would like to go, I just end up walking and finishing in a slower time than if I had strategically rested or slowed down. But you can't stop, stopping is for the weak and resting is wasted time. 

And then there is the stress. The effects of stress are so astounding and palatable it almost makes me want to cry. It was something I was VERY aware of in college. As one of the less smart kids I was always on a razors edge of not 'getting it' in time for the test or quiz. I learned very quickly that if I am to manage my time I need to really think more so about how I manage my stress. A stressed brain is - at first an acute brain - and then hours later a pulsating and very useless bag of goo. 

After a while Prolonged exposure to stress has this way of stripping the life out of people. Higher level function such as creative problem solving and empathy begin to erode. It becomes clear who is experiencing this sort of stress the second you start talking to them. I hope I am wrong with my assessments of coworkers and just being judgmental but I can't help but believe this is the case with some people. There were certain people that just seemed like all of the joy and complexity of life had disappeared from them. Every answer is a canned response, every opinion seems risk averse and void of personal input, every joke is a TV reference

I will be the first to admit I see this happening in myself and it terrifies me. The more I learn about stress (big shout out to Dr. Robert Sapolsky) the more it becomes apparent that it has devastating effects on the human experience and our ability to truly live the wonders of life. But at the same time, I feel almost entirely powerless to do anything about it.",22Oct2019,2
19,"First off I’m really sorry if this in violation of any rules I just needed to get this out because I haven’t been able to say it anywhere until now so hopefully this helps me

And second, some background info, I’m in my last year of highschool and my plans for school afterward won’t let me have a stable relationship. This is my second ever relationship. 

We had so many things we wanted to do and dates to go on, I was about to get my drivers license so we were both super excited for the next month, we could actually do all the stuff we planned out. Hell at this point I was almost in love with her and I think it was a mutual feeling. But over the next couple weeks bad stuff picked up with her family and she had to move away. Once we both realized that it was very possible that she might move and we might never see each other again, we agreed to try and set up a date in which she would let me fulfill my #1 absolute fetish with her, and we would both lose our virginity (huge deal for both of us, we had never actually gone p in v before). One day with no warning she suddenly had to move and we never got to see each other again. I stayed in the relationship with her for a couple days so she could get used to her new home without dealing with a breakup at the same time. Until she decided to cut it off for everyone’s sake, I think she felt bad for me. She was thankful that I stayed with her even through the tough couple weeks when we knew she had to move. 

At this point in writing this I don’t know where I want to take this, I planned on talking about how god damn horny I am because we never got to go on that last date, but reading this over I realized how attached we were in the few months we were together. She seemed way out of my league, in our first two weeks I was in disbelief that a girl this hot actually liked me sexually and for who I am. Then I got to show her off at school and in public, and once she really got to know me she showed me off too (nothing too annoying haha, just having her next to me felt like showing off because she turned so many heads). We were super proud of each other and right as we were about to fall in love any chances of it furthering were demolished by her moving. She was the first girl I’ve cried in front of, and we both told each other about out deepest insecurities. We got really close in the time we were together. 

It’s been a month since we had the break up and I wish I could say I’m exaggerating with this one, but since then I really don’t think I’ve gone more than an hour without thinking about her. It started the get better, but this past week had just been excruciating. The only time I truly stop thinking about her is when I’m talking to other girls ( I know I know bad idea). 

Now for the part I originally started writing this for, which was supposed to be a paragraph or two tops. 

Since we never got to go on this date and have my sexual fantasies played out with my dream girl, I’ve been crazy horny. My standards are very low recently, I’m so desperate to get this sexual energy out. To try and relate what this feels like, imagine blue balls but in an emotional sense. Now imagine building that up for a month and then instead of an orgasm, you’re left with a crazy painful breakup and absolutely no where to get these sexual feelings out.  

TL;DR  me and my dream girl were absolutely obsessed with each other and were about to fall in love until she had to move away. I have a lot of left over emotions from the sudden breakup that I haven’t gotten to express anywhere until now. 

Really any response is appreciated, advice, pity, related stories, anything that isn’t mean. Most of all it helps to get this out there. Yeah",22Oct2019,1
21,"I used to come here a lot and post, trying my best to help others and seek help myself. 

I dont expect anyone to remember me but heres a few improvements my life has seen in a few short months:

* Ive found myself a decent apartment, I was previously at risk of becoming homeless, and was receiving welfare. 

* Ive found a full time job, with a salary, and signed a contract with the company. 

* Ive cleaned up my substance abuse problems. Its still an ongoing battle and I tend to dabble in psychedelics occasionally. Ive also cut my cannabis use down SO much. 

* Ive gained a new sense of purpose and confidence due to all of the above. 

* I have also identified the problems in my relationship and have accepted those issues. At this point I think we are both too scared to be alone. 

Regardless of all this improvement, I still feel uncomfortable in my own skin and mind. Ive been trying to find ways to cope with type 2 bipolar for over a year now, the constant ups and downs are horrible. I dont have a metaphor to explain this very well so Ill just try and explain what I feel;

In my low times I feel more miserable than usual, depression is a constant omen and its impossible to ignore or snap out of. I just feel like a dark cloud is looming over me. But even the darkest clouds will come to pass. 

In my manic episodes, usually not lasting longer than 3 weeks, I feel fantastic! I have energy, compassion, and positivity to spare! The only issue I have with my hyper/hypomania is that I tend to be very anxious. Simple things like a conversation that is too forward or too many questions can lead to a panic attack.

Anyways, I feel I made a breakthrough yesterday. While contemplating all that I have and how I have grown and improved, I realised I still hate myself. I still dont want to live my life, I dont want to be me. And thats where I realised if I dont accept myself and learn to love myself then all my improvement and success will be folly and for nothing. 

I dont know how to accept myself nor do I know how to love myself, but I will do my best.

This is what it says


(Girlfriend name) gave me a note yesterday, 
So I thought I would do the same. Except I’m asking her a question, 
That’s been burning through my brain.
I know I’m special to her,
 and she’s to me too.
And so I though I’d ask for a lunch together, 
Just me and you.
Yes, this is a date, 
I’m asking you on. 
You can say yes if you want,
It’s up to you if me and you can bond. 
I’m new to these things, 
Which is no surprise.
Which is why I’m looking at you reading this, at those beautiful eyes.
Just give me a response, 
It can be today or tomorrow. 
Just hurry up please, 
The suspense and my nerves are killing me.

24,"Personally I've been struggling to keep up with my high school friends, whom I remained friends with til college. My group of friends consists of probably around 12-13 people and we're all about the same age (26,27,28s). Only a couple of years after they graduated that everyone drifted apart. I actually remained a couple years longer in college to finish another major, and even during that time it was hard for me to make new friends so I was alone until I graduated. Fell down into the depression hole for a few years, and all I wanted that time was to see more of them more often. I've completely lost touch of most of them (moved to other countries) , and only got to hear the news of others from the ones I managed to remain in contact with (no social media here).

A few months back we've finally all managed to meet and have dinner, but I was constantly put off by how everyone seem to be updated with everyone else's lives except me. I get that I was MIA for the most part, but what I regret the most is how I've missed out on so much like weddings and trips, while at the same time I keep thinking how or why anyone has not made the effort to reach out to me. If they really wanted to stay friends with me they would've done so, but no. The conversation I got was ""Oh so are you going to X's wedding?"" and my response ""I wasn't invited."" followed by awkward silence and a big fat oof.

Most of the time I feel like they just invite me along to these dinners as a space-filler to keep the group number even, or maybe to surround themselves with people like me they can one-up to, and honestly I'm kinda done with that. I like them, I want to like my friends but I feel that I don't get the same treatment as everyone else in the group. There's another get-together dinner happening in a few hours and I was notified last minute. Should I just flake? It's not like anyone's gonna notice I'm not even there.",22Oct2019,3

A month later she texts me that she’s pregnant and that it’s mine, which has me really fucked up because we used a condom and she said she was in the pill (though I suspect she was lying.)
Anyway, now she wants to keep it, won’t get an abortion, won’t put it up for adoption, and like, this girl is a lying and manipulative child with no foresight, can’t hardly look 5 minutes ahead, let alone 18 years.

28,"So I’m in my Junior year of college, computer engineering. I’ve had pretty good grades up to this point, 3.5 GPA.

I took the summer off because the recent spring semester was so stressful that I decided I wanted to take time off.

I quit my job during this summer, due to new ownership and business going down, with the owner blaming the employees (2 months later, the place is now closed down).

I also suffered an injury, a tear in my hip from going to the gym and going too low on a squat. I’m currently decided whether or not I need surgery, still on the iffy phase. I’ve stopped going to the gym as a result

So, now that you know my circumstances, here’s where I’m at. I’ve basically failed 3 midterms. I’m doing the worst I ever have. I’m procrastinating way more, dragging my feet on studying way more. I don’t know why it’s so hard to bring myself to study this semester.
I know it’s probably me being lazy but even when I admit I’m being lazy and that I should do focus and do better I just can’t. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, I feel like I don’t care but when it’s a day before and hours before an exam I get really nervous, so I obviously care, right?

I know I’m not working hard enough to get good grades. But I’m having such a hard time bringing myself to study this semester. I think it’s a combination of not being able to drive to my college as much to study because of my injury. On top of that, I think having a job made it so I had less time to piss around so I HAD to focus. But now that I have all this extra time, I’m doing so much worse.

I feel like that’s all just excuses, but I just don’t know. Am I being lazy? Am I depressed?",22Oct2019,2

36,"There was a boy that lived down the road from me during the summer. His name was Tyler. This was his dad's house, and he lived with his mom the rest of the year. He was a year older than me, but we both liked playing video games. All summer long, I would go to Tyler's house or he would come to my house. He had a N64, and I had a PS2; so it just depended on what we felt like playing that day.

On the day in question, I decided to go to Tyler's house. I told my mom that I was leaving, to which she relied ""Ok, have fun"" or something like that. I go down there and spend most of the day playing Perfect Dark and eating Twizzlers. Then in the late afternoon, maybe around dinner time, my parents come knocking on the door. They are both happy and angry at the same time somehow.

My mom had forgotten that I told her I would be at Tyler's house. She didn't know where I was. She drove around all the different roads where I would normally ride my bike, checked the marinas where I'd go fishing, looked in the woods behind our house; and of course I was not in any of those places. She called all of our other neighbors and asked if any of them had seen me. I know she had Tyler's phone number, but never called. She had checked literally everywhere that I could have been except where I actually was. She called the police and filed a missing person report on me.",22Oct2019,5
37,"In the past 11 years I have deployed to Iraq and to Afghanistan...

In 2006, I deployed to Mosul, Iraq, I fucked up and misdiagnosed a vehicle and it went down a cliff because they lost all steering and braking,with my friends in it, right in front of me. I had to pull them out screaming and crying for help. It was a bloody mess and I hate myself for it.

When I came home from Iraq in 2007, I had severe PTSD and I didn't seek treatment for fear of being kicked out of the military. I bottled it up and became a living breathing nightmare. 

The next year in 2008, the economy was shit, I had no place to live and was lost. My girlfriend and I fought almost every night. And I drank myself to death. I am numb to everyone I know and my family thinks I don't like them, so they stay away from me.

In 2009, I got married and my daughter was born. I felt nothing. And it hurt me to not feel anything during these events.

In 2011, I deployed to Afghanistan. I ignored my family and just focused on fixing the trucks. I may have called them a total of 5 or 6 times during the deployment. 

During my Afghanistan deployment, I lost both of my grandmothers and I felt nothing, I just had to stay to keep the soldiers safe. My commander looked at me weird and told me to at least take the day off but I didn't and went back to work. 

In 2016, My sister died in a car accident because the guy she was with had weed on him and was being chased by the police, and ended up hitting the electrical pole killing my sister instantly. Evidence showed she was trying to get him to stop the car so she could get out.

In 2017, my wife became estranged from her mother because of her eldest drug addict sister who has four kids. She testified against her sister in court for the father to take custody of his daughter. (Four different kids, four different dads). My wife's mom spited my wife and had not talked to her since. 

When this happened, my wife fell into a depression, thinking about how she only had me left to count on. Someone who is broken and numb... I didn't know how to support her. 

In 2018, my wife's younger sister moved in with us. She takes care of the eldest sister's son, like he is her own. She moved in because she was suicidal because of the way her mom was treating her. 

In late 2018, my landlord died and his alcoholic sister took over the home we were living in. Her and her boyfriend harassed us, while my wife was pregnant and stressed her out so much that it induced labor. We had to move.

This year in 2019, I have started PTSD therapy with the VA. It's not working, I'm on antidepressants and it's very hard for me. My wife doesn't like that I'm exhausted all the time. She is always angry at me because I don't have the energy to do anything because of the medication. 

I'm tired of living like this. I'm tired of disappointing my family. I am tired of hurting. I don't want to process my trauma because I'm to mentally and physically exhausted to do it. I am tired of being in pain, feeling unloved, and feeling like I can't love anyone. It's painful.

I'm so fucking unlucky with shoes, I think it's a curse: bought some asics to not get sweety feet, after 2 months, they do a bizarre sound that is very disturbing (I thrash them, seriously); then I bought a Nike Revolution 4 and how lucky I am because they fitted well but after 5 hours my knees started to hurt (overpronation, non flat sole) and now I bought a spanish brand that has lots of positive feedback (j'hayber) and again something happens: they are huge as fuck.

I don't get what's Mankind problem with this. Can't we just get a universal way to calculate shoes size based on feet dimensions?! Why thefuck is each brand fucking with this?!

Sometimes I think the Universe trolls me because I feel very unlucky and this evening an old lady on street approached me with 1cent and said: ""Ive found this cent, do you want it to give you good luck?"". I said ""no thanks"", a little bit disturbed and then felt bad with intrusive thoughts about ""omg, I should have accepted it, now I'm gonna get unlucky as fuck"".

Im 18, and have been driving on my own for about 8 months now. I dont really like it, and Ive always been very nervous when driving into an area I dont know.

Well, today was an example of why. I had to pick up my brother and his girlfriend, as he now doesnt live with us anymore but still wants to be home sometimes.

Let me paint you a picture of the 4 way intersection where this happened (this was the first time I had to turn left here). From my POV, on the left side, next to the left most lane, was a train rail with a sort of crossing a bit further ahead. When you want to turn left like how I wanted to, you need to drive through the intersection and past the rail crossing, and behind there is where you turn left.
I hope this explains it, im also willing to paint a picture though lol.

I was the third in my lane, and both cars in front of me drive through the intersection, like how you are suppossed to. But me, in my infinite wisdom and complete fucking stupidity, decide that I need to make a sharp left (maybe because there was a white guidance line making it look like it was an option). Obviously, I realize I was mistaken as I was then going toward  oncoming traffic. They were still standing at the light though, but it still made me panic. Then I realized where I was suppossed to go. I now do the only logical thing, turning onto the rail track and driving along them to get to the spot where I can actually turn left. Once I arrive, I drive over some dirt and grass and just... drive like everything I did was my plan.  This all happened in maybe 5-10 seconds.

I felt like throwing up after. How bad did I screw up?",22Oct2019,1

65,"I left home about 4 years ago. My last memory of being in my moms house is her dragging me by my hair across the livingroom. So, as much as I love my mother finally getting away from her abuse, and her unchecked mental illness, was the best thing I did for myself. 

I moved across the country to a city I'd never been to, only knowing one person there; an internet penpal I'd been writing to for years. She told me she had safe and free place for me to stay until I got on my feet. Her s/o's family had a spare room. What I wasnt told until I was already there, was that there was a registered sex offender crashing on the couch, her s/os dad was a very, very bad alcoholic and had started drinking again. And that they were all hoarders. Years later they would deny ever knowing how bad it was, but I dont believe them. I'm not sure how you cant know. While I lived there they had 5+ dogs living there, where were neglected and never let outside or cleaned up after. There were 2 cats, whose litter box was never touched once in the year or more I lived there. None of that is an exaggeration. You can smell the house down the street. 

I was constantly sick. I was mentally ill before hand, moving there certainly didnt help. 

Meanwhile, my friends all ended up being shitty. My penpal, and proclaimed best friend at the time, treated me like a pity project she had taken on. She was also an alcoholic, well, a ""binge drinker"", and would lash out at me saying incredibly cruel and degrading things every time she was drunk. A few times I ended up locked in this person's backseat while her and her s/o drove me around, screaming at me about some percieved wrong doing on my part. About petty drama. I would be sobbing and begging to be taken home, and my friend in the front seat, absolutely wasted, turned to her s/o and told her to keep driving, while she continued to go off at me, insulting me and screaming at me. 

None of our other friends really knew this kind of shit was happening. They convinced me I was always in the wrong somehow and talking about it would make me look bad, not them. 

I eventually got a good job and my own apartment in the suburb. It's been wonderful. Ive been so proud to pay my bills, totally independently. Something absolutely none of my friends could say about themselves. Everything was finally going good, even if my friends sucked. 

Shortly after moving in, I invited that friend over for to chat after a party. Well, actually she insisted I invite her over. She then proceeded to down all the alcohol in my place and got more and more combative as the night went on. Eventually she snapped, and started screaming at me. ""None of your friends even like you. They all just pity you."" ""You're going to be miserable and alone until you die, just like your mother."" ""You're stupid and you know it."" Etc, etc. She also alternated between screaming and suddenly getting so calm and telling me that I was the one out of control and I was scaring her. It was 2 am and I asked her to leave ober and over and over. I threatened to call the cops. After 40 mins, I locked myself in my bathroom and she finally left. 

I finally cut her off after that. 

Meanwhile, at my job, a coworker accused me of stealing a pen. One pen. And she never let it go. From that day on she told every employee I was a liar and theif and to watch their backs. I was accused of stealing money. She constantly went to our boss and told him I was making mistakes I wasnt, leaving work behind for other employees when i had never done that. My boss was an absent minded asshole, and constantly took her word over mine. Eventually this person convinced the other person on her shift I was awful. I'd come in during shift change and ask questions I needed to know for the job, and they all started pretending I didnt exist. They all ignored me. Occasionally they would make a ""did you hear something? No? me neither."" jokes. My boss knew about this and did nothing. I was working 50+ hours every week, constantly asked to work overtime. This lead me to believe my job performance couldn't have been that bad or I wouldnt have been asked to work so many hours. But, when I finally went to HR about the harrasment I was fired 2 weeks later. 

Since then I've been struggling to pay my rent. My friends haven't been supportive at all. In fact after I got fired everyone came over to my place,ad I was already planning on hosting a friend from out of town and everyone wanted to see them. They complained I didn't have anything to eat, and were generally rude. It was summer, so they were complaining about the heat. I apologized and said I couldnt afford to run the AC anymore than I was. They ignored that and every time I was out of the room they turned the AC from 77° down to 69°, the lowest setting, over and over again. One made a comment that she ""didn't like not having the noise"". Bitch, I ain't paying for a damn noise machine. 


Anyway, now I'm not friends with any of them. I can't afford my apartment. As I wrote this my landlord called, I'm sure to ask about my very over due rent. 

I'm moving back in with my mom at the start of next month, and I'm absolutely petrified. I feel profoundly lonely and helpless. I'm exhausted and depressed. I dont think she would physically abuse me at this point, after all these years. Our relationship has changed since I've been so far away. But I'm terrified of navigating this whole situation. 

Ive been working so hard to get myself in a better place and it feels like every step I take I get faced with the shittiest of luck. 

My game plan is to live with my mom for the winter, work as much as I can and save all of that money and move back out and try again. I wont stop trying, but I'm already so exhausted.

67,So yesterday one my friends said something along the lines of you’re trying to be nice but it just comes across so hurtful to me as a joke in the heat of the moment. He’s really good at drawing and I always tell him that and then he proceeds to joke about how I’m lying and stuff. However it still hurt when he told me what I say is hurtful even though I know it was a joke and he apologized. Like I’ve tried so hard to continue being friends with people and him or make friends with other people. On Snapchat the people who I thought at least kind of liked me are basically ghosting me. They continue to take long times to open my messages despite being on and talking in a group chat and when they do respond it’s with some short conversation breaker like k or lol. I don’t really have too many friends and I absolutely suck at making friends so knowing that they don’t really like talking to me and 3 people are ignoring me at the same time hurts. It hurts a lot. I m trying really hard to make/continue being friends with them but I guess I should just let them go since they don’t want to be my friends. :(,22Oct2019,3
68,"I just need to get this off my chest. This is the only secret I have, and I really hate going around with this without anyone I can consult with. 

For months I've had a huge crush on my coworker. I don't know for exactly how long, because one day I just got that tingling in my stomach when I saw him out of nowhere. I can't tell anyone because of the relationship I'm in. It started very lightly and I tried just brushing it off. Then it became so strong that I would dream about him every night and think about him every other second. I wanted to see him so badly, and when I saw him and for some reason we would be close or we would touch accidently, the tinglings would be so strong that I felt naseus. I tried to overlook him or talk more with the other coworkers if he was around, just be far away. And for a while it seemed to work. I would come home and really suppress all those feelings, and it would be normal for maybe a month, untill it came back again. Almost stronger than it was and now I'm sitting here and feel like I have to choose.
A. Wait it out and just bury it till it will dissappear.
B. Quit my job and never see him again.
C. Leave everything and be alone.
D. Break up and hope that he feels the same for me.
I want to do all options..

In the same time I'm afraid that this is something I'm feeling because it is exciting. It will go away, right?

Lately I have been so stupid, and done things that only would fyre the feelings up. Like hang out with him together with other coworkers, sitting close to him, working besides him, chatting.. Some days ago was the worst when we were out and sat besides eachother and our legs would touch, and I didn't move. He didn't either and I hate myself for it. I hugged him when we were parting and even asked him if I could walk him home. I feel drained and dirty. Like a really bad person. I'm so glad he said no. Because I think I would've told him how I felt. And there is no reason for him to know, it is not his problem.
But I think he may know by now anyway because of my weird behavior. Me looking at him when others are talking for no reason, looking at him when I'm laughing to see if he laugh too. Calling him drunk just so we could speak a little longer. And he would have noticed when our legs touched but no one moved. Or maybe he just didn't realise. 

I have to stop now. It feels like I have been cheating for months. I love everything I have home with my boyfriend. If I don't have him it would feel empty and like I was nothing. I'm just so afraid. And so disgusted with myself. The best feeling in the world is to cuddle him, talking with him and just being together. So why am I in love with another person, when I'm loving him. It isn't supposed to be like this.

71,"I have nobody to talk, so I decided to ""talk"" online.

I think I need a place to say it out and also some advice would be very welcomed.

I'm almost 50 y.o., have a spouse and kids. In last years I see that our relationship with my spouse getting worse and worse, it seems that most of the time we irritate each other. We have been together for many years and I think during all those years things that each one didn't like in another summed up and at the same time things that each one liked n another disappeared. In addition t it, it's kind of middle life crisis time, we are getting older, health isn't great, stress is all around, etc. So we continue to run our household, but more and more each one spends time by him / herself. We don't want divorce at the moment because of the kids mostly. Although they are getting older and more and more having their own interests and don't care about us that much. It's also more convenient to live together. But with the things they are right now I feel sad :( So in addition to just venting it out I'm wondering if anyone out there was in a similar situation, what was outcome, did you do anything to improve the situation or your personal feelings about it? I'm not interested in any kind of romantic relationship or affair, I don't have any interests or hobby as well as don't really have time for it since younger kids are still young and need me and I'm working full time, so there isn't much time left.

His eyes are such a light hazel that sometimes they look gold, and his hair is so dark and curly that sometimes i find it almost impossible to keep myself from running my hands through it. I’ve been sick in bed, and yesterday he came over just to bring me the entire god damn pharmacy he has in his apartment. He holds me when my chronic pain gets too intense to bear and rubs my back while talking to me softly. I go to his soccer games to cheer him on, and if he needs help with an essay he asks me to read it over for him which I do every time (which I really don’t need to! he writes incredibly well). 

He’s bilingual, and he translates songs I like that don’t have english translations. He’s also my closest friend. We walked hand in hand the other night and he told me about how I was more than his girlfriend, but his best friend. I feel the same way. And we also spend time with our friends, we’re not always together. We have the perfect balance of shared and not shared life. He is wonderful.

I hope everyone gets to experience the love I have right now. For years I was rejected, and for years I was unable to love people myself. Now I’m ready to try.

Ofcouse i said yes and then she showed me the groupchat with all the people in it and i was happy to see that an couple of “quite good” friends were also coming to the party. a week goes by and i hadn’t heard anything about the party nor was I added to the groupchat. So i asked the girl i liked on the details and she just said it was gonna be next week and that she doesn’t know when and where it is going to be. by now it was already the day before the party and i have yet heard anything about it. So i asked her again if she knew it now and it was still a no. On the day of the party i asked her yet again but still a no, so now I asked one of the “friends” of mine and nope he also didn’t know it. So after a couple times of asking i still didn’t find out, I decided to stay home because i thougt the party was never going to happen.

Sooo.... 30 minutes later i check the snapmap and i see all the people that i knew were coming together and i lost all my hope instantly and i knew i fucked up by trusting them. So i tried to sleep but i just couldn’t.... 

The next day i see a snap from the girl i liked and she immediately starts to apoligize to me and i just didn’t know what the fuck to saw to her and she starts to explain to me that she never wanted this to happen and that it was not her fault and me being the moron that i am i trusted her and asked her who is was.

My ex girlfriend and I were together for 3 years and I loved her so fucking much and didn’t even understand what that meant because I was so young. I thought it was common, I thought I could find that with someone else. I left her before college. I realized my mistake quickly during my freshman year and I tried with every part of myself to get her back and she didn’t want me.

It’s been 3 years, I haven’t been with anyone since. I haven’t felt loved since. I haven’t felt a purpose since. I wake up most days and I miss her immensely, but I try to tell myself that it’s just my memory of our relationship and the feeling of love that I miss. But nothing changes. It’s been 3 fucking years. I think I am broken and worthless and that nothing can fix it. 3 fucking years.

I decided to document our adventures so I made a public Instagram account for him and coworkers/friends to follow along.

91,"24 years old and 6 months ago, I left a 4 1/2 year relationship. Things had gotten toxic, had a moment of getting blown up on that had me not speak to her for a day, ending with meeting up and a mutual breakup.

We met in college, where I got an associate's degree in Radio Broadcasting. Radio didn't work out as a career due to low pay and no chance at career advancement. While I had fun, I didn't see it as a good chance once I learned my superior was only making a few bucks more an hour than me. Since I left, I've been jumping from job to job slowly climbing up in wages. This whole time, I've been focused on my relationship and what our future was. Now that it's over, I'm in a place of having no idea where to go, or what to do.

Currently I work at a law office making 13.50 an hour, still living with my grandparents as the plan was to move out of there with my gf. Through a bit of a spiral after the breakup, I have some credit card debt but not too much that I can't pay it off if I actually slap myself and get financially responsible. But I just feel kind of stuck. This job is pretty dead end, I have no idea what I WANT to do.

I want to move out, but it's expensive. I do need to find a worthwhile career, and am considering going back to school but I have no idea for what. I like computers so It is an option, I've thought about trying to get into databases. But so does something medical related because I think I'd be better off if I was helping others. Another issue is tackling more student loans on top of my radio degree ones, and finding the time because it would be very difficult to keep paying down my debts without working full time.

102,"That is right. Since I was 16 when I had my first girlfriend, I remember feeling jealous a few times and I didn't like the feeling. Then with my second one, it was worse. She was hotter and very popular so a lot of guys in HS wanting hugs for no reason, loud hot friends type of girl too. I didn't like feeling like I had to watch her moves. We ended up splitting for unrelated reasons but this is how my distaste for jealousy was born. I spent 3 years being single after the second girlfriend and during this time I dated a lot of women from 18-21. I had maybe 4-5 girls at a time and I always made sure they didn't know each other. They weren't relationships but I also didn't want to make public that I had other girls waiting for me because they wouldn't like that most likely (the other girls were most definitely doing the same by having multiple guy friends). This is how my resilience began to form. I would just imagine the girls I was dating with other guys either eating together or just texting each other. My jealously and anger went down gradually after doing this thought experiment with myself. I got to the point that I pictured those girls being intimate with guys and I felt nothing. That's when I knew I had mastered it.

Please note that it didn't mean I didn't care for them. It simply meant that I had stopped the intrinsic nature of humans to be selfish. I was able to understand jealously and its meaning to us. I understood that it derived from us wanting someone just for ourselves. I thought this was selfish and I didn't want to feel this way. Now the biggest challenge I've faced with this explaining to my girlfriends (official relationships) that I still love them and care for them. I just don't want the world to miss out on them either. Like if they have multiple friends, I want that for them since I know how much happiness friends bring to me. Or if other guys have crushes on her and they flirt in the comments of their IG posts all the time, I also don't mind that since I understand now that there's nothing my girlfriend can do about those. Even blocking them doesn't solve it. New guys always appear if your girlfriend is hot enough. They'll just keep appearing. It's better to build trust with my partner and in the event that they cheat, I think of that as a good sign. They would be getting rid of themselves and saving me time so I really just let them live their lives as they deem correct while being the best partner that I can be.

That's my philosophy on jealousy. It's brought so much happiness to my life when I have been in relationships and it's so stress free.

&amp;#x200B;

My life was shit; I was on long term disability with no job prospects or anything to live for, I was receiving continued harassment and abuse from my abusive ex-girlfriend and her friends and I felt like I couldn't turn to anybody for help.

So on the Friday night, when people had gone out, I took a lot (and I mean a LOT) of strong painkillers and antidepressants and drank myself to sleep. In my clearly inebriated state I messaged a distant aunt of mine who called my mother. I was woken up on the Saturday morning, barely able to see, speak or stand. I was freezing but pouring with sweat and was trembling while my mother was shouting and swearing at me (understandably afraid) while she tried to call an ambulance. 

The handler on the other end of the phone told my mother that it would take a while for an ambulance to get to me so she was frantic (she can't drive so she couldn't take me herself) and called my best friend. He got to my house and had to fireman's carry me out of my own house, in my pjs into his car and drive me to the hospital. I was still too messed up at the time to understand but once I began to sober up later I realised just how embarrassing that was! 

After being questioned and probed, I was told I'd be spending the remainder of the weekend in hospital so they could ""keep an eye"" on me.

Failing to take my own life is probably the biggest and most important failure of my life. 

In the year that followed; I met a girl and now we have a son, I enrolled and am now going back at college studying psychology so one day, I can help people who feel the way I did.

Everyone is like ""bUt HonDA AcCorDs aRE BUILT LIke A TANK AnD arE aMaZiNg!"" fuck no it's not. Every other person I've talked to at this point that OWNS a fucking Honda Accord tells me the same thing ""Oh they are reliable, but they suck when replacing parts"" they constantly have SOMETHING wrong with it. I get that it needs new tires, it needs new brakes, more fluids, and so on. But FFS why a new caliper? Why are my lights not working? Why is a fuse constantly breaking? Why do I need to get ANOTHER knock sensor? Why do I need to get NEW fucking transmission mounts?! Holy shit I fucking hate cars!

111,"Please don't get the wrong idea. I'm not ""red pilled"" nor do I believe in MGTOW or any of that stuff. I also wouldn't call myself a feminist because I don't understand what feminism is really. I have read about this from posts on subreddits that I guess would be considered the manosphere. Like I said I dont subscribe to that stuff, and I'm not a misogynist but I have read about it.

There's an idea they have that casual sex is morally wrong, at least for the women that they are persuing. I can't argue that, for or against, but I *do* viscerally feel somewhat disgusted by women who ""sleep around"" or have ""fuck buddies"", or sell themselves sexually in any way. Does that make me a bad person? Should I ignore this feeling or try to get over it? Embrace it?

I know that tying sex with shame and getting fixated on it will make you go crazy. Sex is a natural thing that we all want, there is no shame in it. I don't think sexual desire itself is ever wrong. I am also a hypocrite because I don't feel the same feeling of disgust for men who engage in casual sex (I do but on a smaller level). However I can't deny that the feeling exists and I'm not the type who's going to be dishonest with myself about that.

And also as a follow-up do you think theres any argument for a level of sexual prudence in todays world?

Its interesting to think that for thousands of years we had Christianity and other religions that enforced no sex before marriage let alone casual one night stands, but in recent decades casual sex is more and more acceptable and now you're seen as bizarre that you'd even consider abstaining before marriage.",22Oct2019,2
112,"This fall weather tends to bring back memories at times. Today it's raining pretty hard and getting cold, fall is officially here. I was zoning out the window when it occurred to me, an event that took place about 20 years ago. I was about 20 at the time. It was cold and raining, and disgusting out. I was pregnant at the time and was home alone with my two toddlers. I heard a knock at my back door, so I answer and there is this girl about 11 or 12 years old, crying, cold and wet. She was frantic and telling me to please let her in, she just escaped her uncle who had her chained up to a bed. She had no coat on and of course I let her in. She sat on my couch, crying, and begging me to take her to her mom who lived 40 minutes away. She told me she was taken from her mom and placed with the uncle a while back. 

I could have called the police in that moment but for some reason, I just couldn't. Yes I know, he had her chained to a bed. But in that moment, I needed to find her mother. That was the choice I felt I had to make in that moment. And so we waited for my husband to get home. 

He got home, and I explained what was going on, and I could tell he wasn't thrilled with the idea of taking this girl to her mom, but I was relentless and so he agreed. And we packed up the kids, and off we went. 

I found her mom, told her what happened and she thanked me a thousand times over. That child was so glad to be with her parent, and her mom was going to call the police herself. And that was it. I sat in the passenger seat on the way home, staring out into the rain,  hoping like hell something good would come of all of that. I was her age once, and was abused as well. Maybe that's why I refused to call the cops and took her to the one place she was begging to go because I knew she felt as if it was the only place she believed she'd be saved.",22Oct2019,1

122,"I'm on my third and longest break from college, and I'm starting to panic that I'm never going to graduate.

I won't go into all the details of my situation because it's a little tdlr, but basically I've taken several breaks (both for medical leave and academic probation) from my school due to chronic depression/anxiety. My current and third break has lasted 1.5 years and is going on 2, and I'm worried that my previous pattern of failing classes is just going to continue. Each time I go back, I feel an initial surge of optimism and confidence that gets quashed within the first quarter, and I'm struggling to find the motivation to continue when it feels like I'm inevitably going to fail again. I'm really worried that I'll not only end up without a degree, but that I'm going to be saddled with a lot of student loan debt as well. I've thought of transfering, but my GPA is so abysmal (in the mid 1.0 range) that I'm not even sure that would be possible. Without a degree, I'm worried that I've pretty much just screwed up my life and my chances for any sort of job stability are shot. 

I know a lot of this is my own doing, and I'm really beating myself up for all the time I feel I've wasted. Each break I've taken I've spent trying to save and earn money for school, and I feel like I should have been focusing on improving my overall mental health.

128,"I haven't slept properly in days. I can't eat. I can't drink. My anxiety is through the roof. My family doesn't know. I come from a very religious family. It's a long story but here goes:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 27 year old male. University educated. Healthy, fit. I have a career, I'm financially secure and fine. I support my younger siblings financially. I have 5 younger siblings all in their late teens to mid twenties. I live with all of them, its the culture I grew up in. You don't move out until you're married. I'm single, never married. I've never been in a serious relationship before. I'm definitely religious, but not a virgin.

&amp;#x200B;

This all began when I began working for the government with in a department I won't mention due to privacy. I was there for a year, worked 40 hours a week, kept my head down, etc. Then around Jan 2019 my boss was leaving to another department. I applied for the position but didn't get the job. Instead, they hired a new girl from the private sector. 

&amp;#x200B;

We were around the same age. She's only 2 years older than me. But we couldn't be any different. She's white, tattooed, atheist. I'm Somali (black), Muslim, I introduced myself and she smiled at me. I tried to speak but I stuttered (I grew up with a stuttering problem but I outgrew it, however it comes back from time to time). I hurried back in my desk in embarrassment.

&amp;#x200B;

The first few months were [normal.It](https://normal.It) was a huge learning curve for her. A lot of people questioned the hire but she quickly proved people wrong. She was smart, quick thinker, witty, no filter (once you get to know her), 

&amp;#x200B;

That winter, I came out of the office one Friday afternoon and saw her car wasn't starting. It was super cold, and I gave her a boost. She was incredibly thankful and hugged me. I didn't think of it at all and went about my business.

&amp;#x200B;

Every month I have our monthly 1 on 1 meetings to discuss my performance. At first it was business as usual. But as the months wore on these meetings became more and more just as talking and catching up. She would ask me questions and we would chat about virtually anything. I also knew for a fact that she didn't do this for others. She was extremely professional with them. Again, my naive self didn't connect the dots. I know, stupid.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, at home, my mother is a commanding presence. I'm a 27 year old grown man and she lets me be usually, but still annoys me. If its after midnight she still calls asking where I am. Its super annoying but I love her to death. She's also been pushing me to get married. She keeps telling me that she knows many young girls back in Somalia that would be interested. I laugh it off but I knew she was serious. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, my boss at work would message me on the MSN chat that we have set up at work. It was just a casual conversation. One day when I was talking to her (I stutter and sometimes talk fast), I mentioned my brother, she misheard and thought I said my ""brother in law"". Her entire expression changed, as if it bothered her if I was married. When I clarified that she gave me a beamed smile. Hr smile was very attractive to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then she added me on Facebook. We chatted some more. Just friendly things. I considered telling a coworker who I trust, but I figured I couldn't do it. Too much gossip and just wasn't worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

Then came a celebration this past summer. A coworker invited all of us to Boston Pizza and many people from work came. I never drank a sip of alcohol in my life up until that point. I felt a little hazed but since I had half a cup I was still perfectly ok. I realized it was only me and her walking out together. There was a cab right in front of the place and I got in. I thought she was walking me to my cab but she went in the cab too. She gave the driver the address. I was shocked. Stunned. Mystified. When she touched my leg and started messaging my thigh I had a huge boner and couldn't control myself.  

&amp;#x200B;

We went back to her apartment and had sex. Incredible sex. I never had sex with a white girl but it was mind blowing sex. And yes, I used protection. She was so attractive it was mind boggling. She said she would get a tattoo with my name on it on her ass cheek. That turned me on more. She taught me different positions I didn't think of before. 

&amp;#x200B;

I spent the night with her. The I panicked. I looked at my phone. It was 430am and I had 34 missed calls from my mother. I called her back telling her I was with my friend and would be staying at his for the night. I texted my friend and he covered for me. I know its pathetic at age 27 but what can you do.

&amp;#x200B;

The next morning I left and she kissed me goodbye. I left with regret because I went against my religion. 

&amp;#x200B;

But it didn't end there.

&amp;#x200B;

The next working day she walked by my desk and handed me a small piece of paper. It had her number on it. I texted her and we swapped all of sorts of stuff to each other. 

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I spent a lot of time at her apartment for the next 3-4 months. At first, the thrill and excitement was amazing. But then I began to really like her. But I was torn. I love my family too. But there was no way in a million years my mother would ever accept a her. Especially given that she's atheist. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then the nightmare really began: I got a text from her saying she wanted to discuss something. I honestly thought it was because she wanted to end things. Which hurt me, but I thought it was for the best. When we did meet, she started with ""I didn't have my period this month"". It still didn't click for me. Then the following two words gave me a heart attack almost.

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm pregnant"". 

&amp;#x200B;

My world shattered that instant. I thought to myself, ""how"". I've used protection every time I've been with her. But that didn't matter.

&amp;#x200B;

Then it hit me what I've been doing. I've been sleeping with my boss for 4 months now, putting both of our careers in jeopardy, and I've gotten her pregnant. To a girl my mother would NEVER EVER accept. Not only that, but this is not how I wanted to have a child.

&amp;#x200B;

But at the same time, I do like her. She's incredibly smart, attractive, fit, and really caring. However, with that being said, she can have some violent outbursts at times. She's not a morning person and can get extremely moody. But nobody is perfect.

&amp;#x200B;

She told me she is having the child whether I'm going to be involved or not. She told me she has feelings for me and is willing to try a relationship but not at this point in our careers at work. Abortion is out of the question anyway, its against my values and beliefs.

&amp;#x200B;

She told me I should tell my mother, but I don't have the stomach for it. I love my mother to death. I'd take a bullet for her anytime. But this would break her heart. She is incredibly religious and I know her. SHE WOULD NEVER ACCEPT THIS. I don't want to burden her more, she has already been through a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

I like my girlfriend I guess you can call it, but I don't love her. I care about he future and her well being,  but I'm conflicted if she's the person I want something long term with. 

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? I'm ready to be a father, but not like this? My family will disown me. They wouldn't want to meet her. My community will shun me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've never been depressed like this before. Any solid advice would be appreciated.",22Oct2019,5

Here it is.

Unloved

I am so angry. Everything I do and anything I do is not enough. My hardships are nonexistent. I am easily just going through life without lifting my finger. Is that what you think of me? I don’t have that kind of privilege just as you don’t have that privilege. You raised me better than that. You told me to never accept anything less than and to always work for what I want. I’ve endlessly done what you ask and yet I am still a failure in your eyes. Why? What fault to I carry for you to despise me so much? What is it? Because I decided that Islam is a fucked up religion that preaches only oppression of my gender? Because I decided to stop fueling the patriarchy? Because I realized my value as a woman and my value as a person. Because I will not be reduced to what you expect of me. I will only live by my own beliefs. I no longer see the world through your eyes. I no longer believe in what you believe in. We are no longer the same. I have grew out of your tight grasp. And now you are scared. You’re fucking terrified because you saw what it did to me. You saw what the world did to me. It opened my eyes. You took my eyes away and put up a smokescreen. You gave me rose colored glasses. You should have known that wouldn’t work forever. I’m not like you. I’m me. I will no longer abide by your rules and obey them blindly. I am never going to let you tell me what is best for me because the entirety of our relationship is based on bragging rights. Years and years of fucked up manipulative bullshit masked as “love” passed down from generation to generation and the guilt of feeling anything negative about you is no longer existent. I am aware. I’m now aware of how fucked and manipulative you are. Both of you. I don’t give a damn about you “sacrificing” your life for me. That sounds wrong. You did it for you. The minute I step outside the cage you imprisoned me in, I’m no longer your daughter. I am no longer someone a part of this family. What happened? What did I do?
I left the religion.
I cut my hair. Shorter. And even shorter than that. You stopped talking to me. Months passed. Nothing. You called me a boy. How typical of you? What did I expect anyway. I didn’t fit the Pakistani beauty standards for a woman. And no man would want to marry a woman who resembles a boy. Because having long hair is equated to beauty. There’s always something wrong with me. I’m too fat. I’m too short. I have glasses. My hair is short. I dress like a boy. I am not feminine enough. I don’t have etiquette. I don’t talk soft. I don’t submit. I don’t listen and obey. 
I am everything you hate and I don’t care.
I am the embodiment of a failure in your eyes.
I fell in love. I fell in love and you’re totally against it. Why? Because he is non Muslim. Why does that have to matter? I don’t understand why I was born into this faith and family. Nothing about this culture makes sense. We are all depressed. No one is happy. And the moment I find genuine happiness, I am disowned for it. That’s what I was talking about. The moment I do something that you disagree with, I get cut off from you. Is this why you only despise me? What about my brothers? They will always be adored, no matter what they do. This is the fucked up, backwards, manipulative, double standard goddamn bullshit I was talking about. I hate this culture. I hate how you forcefully endorsed this culture upon me, making me grow up confused about my identity, depressed because my identities didn’t match, and isolated because I didn’t belong in either. You ruin everything.
You tell me I’m “too American”. What does that even mean? What kind of insult is that? Is that the best you can come up with? You can do better. 
 “waste of space” “piece of shit” “dumbass” “worthless” “selfish” “ugly” “fat” “unintelligent” “lazy” “you should go kill yourself” 
Sound familiar? You’ve said all of that. And now that’s all I say about myself. I don’t want to hate myself. I want to love myself. But the people who brought me into this world see me as worthless? Why should I even bother trying? 
But that was the old me. The old me used to take everything you said seriously. Now I have risen from the ashes and I don’t give a goddamn fuck about what you say about me. I know who I am. I know that I work so goddamn hard for what I earn. I don’t care if you think otherwise. I am the only person who I need to worry about and improve. The things I do will only impact and benefit me in the future. You do not own me anymore and that scares you. This was what you were trying to prevent but when I’m determined about something, I will fucking overcome it. 
It just so happened to be you. And I will overcome you. And your manipulative tactics to bring me down.  It will no longer work. You no longer hold anything over me. I am free from your imprisonments. I don’t feel guilt for leaving you behind. You left me a long time ago. I wish you happiness in your life. Not that you care about mine.

Goodbye.",22Oct2019,1
130,"Suddenly one day I started getting small headaches, not very strong but consistent - turned out the only way to not get headaches was to do nothing that required concentration or was overly stimulating, but I could still feel “the aura” of pain in my scalp like a headache waiting to come..

As a developer, not even being able to play Fifa has rendered me unable to work - I could watch Tv but not something that requires interaction per say..

I’ve been investigated for pretty much all physical causes known to man, and am healthy as a horse, apart from some high kidney-numbers..

As weeks went by, my condition worsened while I continuously tried out exercise (I usually do a lot of sports) and tested my limits by trying to work or game in front of the screen..

Then suddenly, I started having very small anxiety attacks when trying to fall asleep and it turns out that the whole reason for my headache symptoms is due to underlying anxiety!

I’m not out of it yet, but I saw the netflix docu “GameChangers” about plant-based diet, and decided to switch. The change has been Very positive, better energy and less anxiety! 

So for anyone having likewise symptoms and not knowing why, consider if you have anxiety!

For people with anxiety, I really recommend trying out a plantbased diet to help you overcome it!

I've never been depressed like this before. Any solid advice would be appreciated.",22Oct2019,1
132,"I'm a registered Republican. I have been since I turned 18 and was able to vote. I have since voted Republican many times. I voted for Bush both times, I voted against Obama both times, and I voted for Trump.

I often cried 'oh what a narcissist!' Obama was, ""He's acting like a spoiled child!""...

I am truly sorry. I didn't give you the credit you deserved. While I have long thought of myself as not someone who holds the party line, but strongly leans towards the conservative side, I have learned that the party I belong to has rarely actually been the party I believe in. I can no longer support a party simply because I am pro-life and I believe in God. It is no longer acceptable to disregard all the problems with my party simply because they claim to hold to two beliefs I have. Likewise, it is no longer acceptable to dismiss so much of the Democratic party simply because they do not agree with two ideals that are very important to me.

I think it's time to change my registration. I'll register as an independent. This administration has made me ashamed to be a Republican, and has shamed me for standing alongside such a disgraceful man as our current President. I guess I also have to apologize to all of you whom I voted against. Hopefully we can do it right this time, and not repeat our last mistake!",22Oct2019,3061
133,"So today is my 3 year year anniversary. With the woman who I love more than anything, we've lived together for almost 2 years too due to some unsavory circumstances but we've made due. Even through some lows we've aleays managed to come out on trop.

But a few days ago our precious cat Snowy went missing while we were away celebrating a friends birthday, we ended up staying out a second night because my partner wasn't feeling up the the rest of the drive home.

My dad and step-mom live with us so we asked them to feed our cat (there are several pets in the house so it's normal).

But since we've been back we Havnt been able to find her, she never leaves the house even overnight, but its been at least 3 nights with no kitty snuggles for us and its been heartbreaking. She's our little baby and we don't know what to do... 

I just kinda needed to get it out, we are so worried.",22Oct2019,4
134,"I get so happy when someone says my name.

someone actually remembering my name and saying it out loud to me is just such a weird but amazing concept.  idk it always shocks me when people say my name to address me  but it makes me so happy. I sometimes forget people actually think about me and form opinions that are about me and when someone says my name I get reminded again that people actually think about me! it’s a little thing I absolutely adore :)

136,"My boyfriend recently started getting therapy and chose an older man (in his 70s). (Btw he is getting therapy to work on issues for making our relationship work.) 

When I asked him about the gender/age of his therapist, he said he intentionally chose an older man because his one previous experience with therapy was when he was 25 years old and the therapist was a 28 year old blonde female. He said “she looked good” and was unable to open up to her honestly because he thought in his head, “I can’t say that - I can’t get laid.” 

I got hurt/upset, especially because we have had turbulence in our relationship and had JUST been getting better. It hurt more because recently he has been intentionally avoiding giving me compliments because I claimed he “love-bombed” me and I fell for him b/c he made me feel “special.” He said he still stands by all the compliments he gave me before and still finds me attractive, but he wants me to genuinely want him for who he is, not because I love how he makes me feel special / fuels my ego, which makes sense. I do see where he’s coming from. 

Anyway, when I told him all this, he didn’t really seem sorry. His response to my hurt was “why? She had nothing on you” basically that I am more attractive. That actually made me more upset because that wasn’t the point. 

He also said he was talking about a situation from 5 years ago “so long ago.” 

Tldr: am I wrong for feeling upset that my bf brought up an incident from 5 years ago, where he found his therapist attractive and wanted to get laid?",22Oct2019,2
137,"I don’t really know how to start but I’ll try it anyway.

Since my teenage years I feel like I am losing empathy towards people and just everything at all.
But it just have gotten so bad to the point that I don’t felt anything at all when I heard that my grandparents killed themself. In fact i almost couldn’t care less. And I feel shit because of it. It’s not that I didn’t like or „love“ them it’s just that their death was irrelevant to me. It was same as my other grandfather died so it was not because of shock or anything.
But where i am most aware of my lack of empathy is just during the normal work day. People often are really shocked and sad about bad news (like if someone was fired ) while I basicly just pretend to be shocked for a few minutes or something. There are many instances were it is the same but I hope you all get my point.

All of this is just eating me up from the inside. Especially knowing that i was not always this way.",22Oct2019,6
138,"If I had a a TON of money, I would become a comedian.

Hear me out!
I would be awful, worst puns in the world, sometimes I’ll even just talk about my feelings, for hours on end!

But! every time the shows about to end, I will give away free first class holidays to 30% of the audience that are dressed the weirdest/worst (night even have themes!)

People will come to my show, sit bored for hours while forcing a laugh, and dress ridiculously all for an amazing free holiday.

Who needs a therapist when you have an audience!?",22Oct2019,7

141,"I'm pretty upset... right at the beginning of the test, there was a really narrow turn out of the testing centre parking lot. There were cars coming in, and I cut the turn too narrowly and went up the curb. The examiner said the whole rest of the test went really well, I parallel parked behind a car with a bike rack which made it difficult, and reversed perfectly into a stall on the opposite side, which I've never done. I did full stops at all the stop signs, and shoulder checked all turns and lane changes. But that one fuck up at the beginning failed the test. I have been practicing a lot since my first test, which I agree that I shouldn't have passed. I was not confident and my parking sucked. I was ready this time, but that one thing messed it all up.",22Oct2019,8
