Who are you trying to change for?""* I hate it how it's always convincing me I'm a burden to my friends and family. Always keeping me up at night over thinking everything I've done in my life. *""Why did you do/say that? Why did/do you lie? Why did you let this happen?""*

That I shouldn't reach out to people because I'm bothering them with my problems. That I shouldn't even causally reach out because they're doing things more important than talking me to. *""They've got better things to worry about than talk to you. Why are you bothering them? They'll just ignore you.

2,I’ve had crushes before. But they were all “unrequited love” situations. So at this point the thought of someone actually liking me enough to have sex with me is a foreign concept to me. I’ve never had close guy friends. Never been kissed. Obviously no sex. I want to have sex I guess. I’m get horny like most humans. But the thought of actually doing...I don’t know. I just cringe when I think about it. I get embarrassed when I see couples and stuff loving on each other and people talking about their relationships. I feel like something might be wrong with me. I’m a female btw. I’m not in college currently so meeting people isn’t that easy.,20Oct2019,12
3,"I have always had a couple of insecurities about myself, for a while I had acne and a stupid hanging tooth. I was skinny, I had gross hair. I realized though, after working out or getting braces, acne treatments, hair cut, etc. even after “the problems were gone”, i still felt as if I weren’t good enough. It took me a little while to realize that that it wasn’t all these “outside adjustments” that would make me better, that the problem really was how i talked down to myself and viewed myself as a whole. That negativity was still there after I made physical changes. The “ being attractive” part was never about your crystal clear skin And huge dick or your crystal clear skin and huge, uh vagina. It was about being ok, eventually, that you have these flaws and knowing that there is more to you then them. I think thats what confidence really is.",20Oct2019,11
4,"Listening to songs from 2-3 years ago, yet you feel this difference in everything.

You remember the feeling of the time we heard the songs.

Some were during heartbreaks, some were from meeting a friend, some were a trend of some years.

Yet only if 2-3 years pass, you feel the difference in the world, in people, in you.

It's so amazing and overwhelming the mixture of feelings you get that

I just can't handle most times.

Listening to songs you would hear with someone you don't have the chance to now, either of the circumstances.

It just creates a mess in my head,

how everything evolves around us all the time.

People change, climate changes (yes, it does), the world changes, you change.

We become different people in time, with completely different preferences, ideologies, opinions, feelings....

And when you remember what was before, you see the person you were back then.

And this mixture of feelings overwhelms you.

Now imagine being 40 years old and remembering your teenagehood. 

Man, I can't imagine how amazingly terryfying it's gonna be for me.

We don't want to lose people, but that's how change works.

Situations change, we change. People around us change.

Life itself changes.

And we more or less can't do anything about it.

Only adapt, like humans have been doing ever since we took our first steps on Earth.

Adapt...

But feelings are too strong for us to handle many times. 

Man life itself is so complicated. 

Conciousness, feelings.....

A beautiful mess that changes every day.

So let's just life as beautifully as we can, as a friend of mine once said.",20Oct2019,3
6,This hasn’t happened before and seems to have stopped but every 15 seconds or so there’s a thumping noise I keep hearing. It isn’t too loud or annoying just kind of unnerving. We have people hunt a couple miles away and sometimes we hear that but this has a deeper pitch and happens really frequently. It’s night so I don’t think it’s construction. My family is hearing it too so I’m not going crazy. Have you guys ever experienced this kind of thing before?,20Oct2019,2

14,"Hey everyone. I'm 23, male, and weigh 194 lbs. All flab, no muscle. A few days ago, I was unfortunately diagnosed with pre-diabetes and an enflamed liver,which could mean liver disease. I don't drink, so it's likely my horrible diet. 

Yesterday, I jogged for 30 minutes, then followed up with 16 squats, 30 sit ups, 20 dumbbell curls, 13 leg raises and a 15 second plank. It's not much, but it's a start.

Today, I jogged for 35 minutes and did some stretching.

I am focusing more on lean meat, cutting back on dairy, sugar, carbs and saturated fats. I've been eating plain oatmeal, apples with peanut butter, nonfat Greek yogurt with vanilla extract, blueberries and a teaspoon of sugar. (ok, not proud of that but without it it's like eating sour cream  out of a bowl. yuck lol)

I hope to weigh in at 130 sometime next summer. (I'm not sure how realistic that is, though.)
(of course, while weight is important, what's more important is being healthy.) Diabetes runs in my family, both types. So I figure I should do what I can now rather than get worse and worse until it's too late.
.
.

TL;DR- I'm overweight, diagnosed with pre-diabetes and liver disease, and I'm taking control of my diet and lifestyle now to get healthy.

16,"hi. my sister has a 10 year old daughter and she is very protective over her mom. Any time my sister is drinking, she asks her how many glasses she’s had or accuses her of stumbling and slurring her words. My sister is definitely not like this and usually only has a few glasses at most, and is a great parent and hard worker. My neice’s anxiety over my sister drinking has gotten so bad that if she knows that my sister is going out with friends, she’ll scream and cry and beg her to stay home so she won’t “leave her alone and get drunk”. 

We’re all super worried about this behavior because my sister is not an alcoholic and should be allowed to have a glass of wine without hearing something from her 10 year old. Its gotten to the point where if she wants a glass of wine with dinner, she has to pour it into a dark cup so that her daughter wont know its wine. She’ll yell at her mom or will get angry with her if she suspects that she’s been drinking at all, and will give her the silent treatment or cry. My neice looks up to me and I think she would maybe listen to me if I talked to her, but I have no idea how to go about this.

19,"I stumbled across this article about the message behind Marge Simpson and her pink suit and it made me realize that everything I've ever done to get some form of recognition for whatever talent I might have has sucked the life and joy out of anything I do. This quote from the article really hits me personally. 

""The blinding pink specter of Marge’s Chanel pops up time and time again  when I find myself in that exact scenario, frantically sewing something  for an event or party where I sometimes seek acceptance that I don’t even realize I don’t want, half-heartedly attempting to keep up with the trusties and influencers in my industry and locale.""

Writing, photo editing, basic art skills, basic knowledge of audacity and video editing...All of it lost its joy and meaning when I realized that I ended up doing all of it because I wanted some form of notoriety or attention that I've never had before (I've never won anything in my life beyond just school attendance awards fyi). I remember back in sixth grade when I wrote a story that did bring the teacher to tears and I've always wondered since then if I would ever be able to influence that kind of emotion in anyone ever again. I don't think so anymore. I sometimes wish it was easy to quit everything, but I always go back to it knowing well that no one does care, that my effort isn't good enough because it's always out of a need for quantity over quality, and in the end, it's all I really have to keep my mind busy beyond college so I do end up going in circles with half-assed work whenever I crave some form of interaction.",20Oct2019,3

A year ago I was with this girl, I had finally worked up the courage to ask her, we were walking to the cafeteria to have lunch together and goes who we ran into at the cafeteria line... you. That was fine, she's your friend and we are acquaintances, logically we greeted but then you joined us for lunch! Dude, uggg, it's so annoying to even remember. I got discouraged after that. Fine. Miraculously, I find myself at a festival with this girl, just the two of us. We've been chatting for hours, I even told her how I had a crush on her a year ago. Everything is going great, we are at the general area watching the artists perform,even tho my ticket has access to the vip area. She knows I didn't hang out with a friend that I haven't seen in years because I would leave her alone and my friend came with 2 more friends so she is fine. So she knows I stayed with her and she seems happy, it's been really great and then she suddenly screams ""Álvaro!"". You walked right in front of us, and ofc, she saw you, cause I sure didn't. Again man, just say hello and be on your way. But no, god no, you actually even one uped me. You asked her if she wanted to get into the vip zone and she said yes. All you did was hand her your bracelet, which I suggested to her earlier if she wanted to sneak in, but she seemed fine. Fuck you man, really.

These thoughts make me feel lonely. I know i’m a nice person (and slightly weird), but I just can’t seem to understand why and it bothers me that I think about this so much. I’m grateful I have people who seem to want me around, but idk why they do? Does this mean i’m insecure?",20Oct2019,1

24,"To give a basic rundown, I'm an early 30s man who has come dangerously close in the past to being lumped in with the incel crowd. I recently started a new job, where I promised myself I wouldn't get fixated on attracting a potential girlfriend/fuck buddy/ whatever, because I have always just embarrassed myself. At the same time I started to take better care of my appearance and hygiene and made a conscious effort to hide my anxiety (especially when it comes to women) and to just politely treat everyone as a coworker. Fine. 

The two hottest women in the store have become aggressively interested in spending their downtime flirting with me, and I hardly know how to react. So far, I've either ignored their ""advances"" or gone along with it lightly while keeping a casual tone. 

This situation has come as a complete and total shock to me. I don't feel like I even know HOW to flirt and I'm just about as confident that if anything does eventually happen that my kissing skill, for example, is going to be about what you'd expect from someone who hasn't had a real relationship since high school.

27,"       I don’t usually go out with my mom, not anymore, and I miss her being with me. It saddens me because I feel like we are growing apart ever since I graduated high school, and now she is always with my littler sister who always uses her as a personal chauffeur. She has complained before about it telling me that she would like to do something else to entertain herself and it pisses her off that my sister is always going out to parties or with friends every.single.time and returns home around 1-3am (she is 16 btw).

Well, She was invited to a fashion runway (thanks to me) this Monday from my friend who is a local fashion designer but very well known in my country, and I’m part of his team. He is a dear friend of mine who I consider as a brother, he has taught me a lot of things, and this is my second time working with him. My mom thinks he is using me (It’s an internship) or taking advantage of me by the fact that I drive and he doesn’t (I don’t know what she means) She thinks I only do “messengering” but no, I had to organize the dynamic with him and another intern, Talk to the models and important people, sent invitations, fitting (clothing), give some ideas, etc... 

You see, I’m an aspiring fashion designer and this is helping a lot to learn how fashion works and how to do a runway. My friend have taught me about pricing, organizing, public speaking, management, and so on. I’m also gaining experience. 

Well, since my friend knows my mom he invited to his runway and I was happy because finally I could at least do something with my mom (sure’ I’ll be helping around but when the show starts I’ll sit with her) and also my dad and sister was invited. But, when I told her about it she instantly made a face, shamed me for being “used”, told me I was like a slave, and the reason the designer is my friend is because “I’m doing him favors”. 

That made me feel sad and angry at the same time....And I really don’t understand. Last week, she told me she wanted to go to a fashion runway and now she is acting like this!  And I managed to be in one.

When I told my dad I was left very upset he told me “It’s a show for women and gay people and I don’t want to hang around them” “it’s a show for women’s only” “it’s gay” “it’s not that important because you wouldn’t be the one doing it, so why care?” “You never do anything.” 

The only one who wants to go is my little sister, as she didn’t hesitate. 

But, I am sad now. I feel worthless, questioning everything, and insecure.

28,"I don't even know what to do with myself, Reddit and wait to be tired really. I'm not interested in doing anything when I'm not or can't be drunk or high. Even then I'm not interested in doing much, but at least some videogames or an occasional TV show seem fun. Without those things to feel anything, I just lie in bed, bitch on Reddit, be generally irritable to the few people in my life. No job, no longer in education, basically failed at life, stolen a ton of money over time from my mother to finance both habits. Yeah, that's the worst thing about me, give me all the shit you want. 

Ironically, while she's the only reason I'm ever able to get those things and feel anything like I'm actually alive, she causes me a ton of stress too. I don't like eating if she sees me with the food, so I waited to eat for a long time tonight until I heard her breathing change to a sleeping pattern, so I could get food without her knowing. She always asks me about food, I want to fast just to spite her but I'm too weak willed and hunger wins eventually. 

She's my only support and does so more than anyone reasonably should, I shouldn't be unemployed, uneducated, and living with her. But she's also often the worst thing in my life, and she's so afraid of everything (she, in her own gravely self righteous way, interrogated me about my drinking habits when she saw me with one box of wine) and paranoid concerning the stupidest things. I do sneak around her all the time and steal, do drugs, so I guess it's justified now. She made me a sneaky kid when I had to be though, with her often strangely strict rules. It meant little to no personal conversation since middle school since I couldn't talk to her about things that actually interested me, for fear of that thing being taken from me. Now, I can't talk to her about anything for the obvious reasons, as well as her long-standing habit of making disclosing anything even a little off color a universally negative experience. One day I heard a friend on a phone call with his mom, she was on speaker, it was like night and day how open and easygoing they were with each other. I couldn't imagine it until then, now I'm vaguely jealous. 

I desperately miss booze as soon as I don't have anymore. Same with weed. It's always my primary concern getting more, and mentally mapping out when I might be able to do so. The days I don't have anything, I just wait through, not doing anything, unwilling to I guess, and just wait. I guess my ideal activity is Redditing while drunk, and my default activity is Redditing while sober, but I don't enjoy that or anything else without external substances or some other kind of motivation. 

No one reads these posts, it doesn't matter. I previously asked Reddit how it felt like to feel anything, and I guess I got my answer. (If it changes after you read this, my post had no responses at time of writing.) Yeah, my life sucks, yeah, it's my fault, yeah, it's incumbent on me to be better. I guess I don't want to though.",20Oct2019,18

31,"I've always found fish oil pills to be very aesthetically pleasing; they're opulant and glamorous, but in a humble sort of way. They display some ornamental qualities, kind of like a marble or a bead of glass, but then again you wouldn't hang fish oil pills on a chandelier. It's strange for something so simple and unnatural to be so beautiful. I feel like if they were short on budget for creating the alien in Annihilation, then they could've just used a fish oil pill. Because in nature, something like a fish oil pill should never exist, but it feels so familiar, like I grew up with a fish oil pill in the womb or something and then carried a very peripheral memory of that relationship throughout my life as a human. The alien in the movie had flashy colors and cool graphics--things that humans are already drawn to, and things that are already found in the immediate world. You're able to paint that and frame it and think it's pretty. But imagine just painting a fish oil pill. Something like a that doesn't transcend space and time, nor does it make you ""wow"" when you look at it, but that's the point. Like, aliens aren't supposed to be beautiful or scary... We only know those emotions because our brain are constructed to react to certain situations or images that way. Aliens aren't part of that system. Imagine that somebody discovered a new color. You'd think that it's very dull or it's not very exciting. In fact, you probably won't think anything of it. That's because your brain doesn't have the code that makes us attracted to certain colors for that color. Same goes for aliens. It's like that feeling you get when a friend is sharing a song with you and you don't understand why they like it so much. Or when you lose your appetite after taking adderall and nothing tastes good anymore. Or when you discover something new about a certain person and you don't get that same rush of dopamine whenever you see them.

Well anyways I held a fish oil pill for the first time in my life and it was squishy. I'm disappointed somewhat because I thought it would be like glass or acrylic. But it's like a fluid in some sort of coating. So I guess that's all I had to say.

43,"My older half-brother (same mother) who is now 28 has been off the rails for the past few years. Since his early teenage years he was always at parties where he got into alcohol and marijuana. Although this is standard for teenagers, he did not stop in his early twenties as he continued experimenting with more extreme drugs when he moved out of home. It has now gotten to the point to where he has been regularly smoking meth for the past few years. Since he started a few years ago, my parents found out quickly and moved him back home to get him back on his feet, so he could also focus on his job. He would eventually move out on his own again after a few months until he would relapse. This cycle has repeated to now where he is in a very bad state.

He is living at home with us, he quit his job and is still smoking meth regularly. Home life is hell. He makes the house a mess, he talks to our Mum like trash, his carelessness has let the family dog go missing multiple times, he eats all the food in the house, he refuses to flush after using the toilet and refuses to clean up or take responsibility for anything he ruins. Although he sounds like an asshole, he was never like this and it is obviously a result of the drugs. 

My parents have been arguing the same points for the few years since. My dad (his step-dad), wants him to live on his own as when he lives with us, he ruins the house and believes that if he’s to recover, he needs to do it on his own terms. Our mum wants to keep him at home to ensure his safety and well-being despite how badly he treats her and how he ruins the house. 

Recently, my dad found my brother smoking meth in the backyard while me and my sister where in the house. An argument between the two broke out and when my mum arrived and found out about the situation, she kicked out my Dad for the rest of the day. Her reasoning at the time was that because my dad is not his biological father, he has no right to argue with him, despite my dad being his step-father for the past 19 years. This was a few months ago and I secretly hated how she treated my dad for trying to do things right. Until now. 

Yesterday my mother and I were talking about my older brother which turned into a conversation about drugs/alcohol. We were talking about how my brother doing a drug as simple as marijuana during his teenage years led to his position now and has been the reason why I have never been drunk or gotten high despite being at the end of my teenage years. She then told me that my father was the one who supplied my brother with marijuana for the first time when he was 14 and continued to supply him for most of his teenage years. Hence contributing to starting his drug addiction and downfall. 

I am confused about where I stand now. I used to not believe my mum when she would say that he favours me over my brother due to me being his biological son, but I know for a fact my dad would never supply me with any drugs or alcohol the same way he did my brother. 

What do I do?
Do I confront my dad about this?
Is my mum lying to prove a point? 
Does this even matter to me? Is it my problem?
Should I forget about all this and move on?
How can we get my brother to recover?",20Oct2019,1

45,"I am the man who has everything that he wants. Willpower, among innumerable other things, is a delight scarcely present at his life’s banquet. On the rare occasion that it is served, ignorance is its saucer. He craves and hopes for my wealth, respect, power, importance, value, and received worship - whichever is the catch-of-that-day. Holding his unimaginative attention just long enough to distract him from the futility of his last mental expedition. And so the cycle continues. He is too dumb (and numb) to be tortured by it. For his underworked and underdeveloped emotional core cause him not to focus on how to actually attain the things he wants. No. He lives with me. Sucks on my nectar. I am his transplantor, however unmatched we are. 

His view into my life has been, at different times in our relationship, vastly wide-ranging. Each point of view feeds his festering fascination and infatuation with my possessions, plunging him deeper into his pit of despair. Think of it as you would a holiday visit to an unfamiliar city. To a man in despair, as he approaches this new fun city from a distance, let’s say from across a lake, the destination seems big, overwhelming, too good for him, impossible for him to enjoy to it’s fullest. Thus defeating furthermore the already defeated man. On the other hand, as he docks, and arrives to his room and begins to venture out amongst the crowds, he hears the laughter, sees the smiles and satisfaction, all the while unable to feel those things himself. Another sandy gulp of despair. Eager to return home with me, he gives up and retreats. Thus have his views been of me - far enough away to leave room for his defeated mind to fill in the gaps and close enough to nearly feel the warmth of true, effortless happiness, but unable to enjoy. Why? Because he is not me. And I have everything that he wants.

But then decided against it and it became draining for me. I was crying myself to sleep every night. I was being left on deliver and i felt like dirt. I felt played. But now. No more. I'm gonna move on and focus on myself. We agreed to be on speaking terms and i promised him i will always be there as a friend if he needs someone to talk. I know he is hurting and i know he has bad days and while I'm trying to make myself a better person i could be a better person to him too. There will always be a soft spot in my heart for him that will wish for him to be happy. And I'm gonna become happy too. I'm gonna find myself again. And I'm gonna be happy.

One of my artworks has over 1,500 favorites and 40 downloads, with 120 comments. I often get my art featured in lots of groups and people telling me how professional my art looks and how it looks like Pixar (my greatest inspiration) made it sometimes. Contrary to what some people might say, these comments never get old to me and I get this wave of happiness whenever I read them, even if my day has been complete shit. I always make sure to respond to each and every comment, thanking them for their kind words. Even one of my pictures that isn't art, but a photo of myself, gets a lot of nice comments complimenting me on how I look.

I've been depressed for years due to health symptoms and I had a suicide attempt last year that sent me to the ER. I've been having neurological symptoms and it's suspected I have a brain tumor that's been missed by incompetent doctors and my worsening symptoms have been causing me a lot of daily pain and stress (I'm on a whole bunch of anti depressants and prescription sedatives that are borderline controlled substances just so I can sleep properly) and art is the only thing that distracts me and gives me hope and being acknowledged for my art is pretty much the only thing that makes me happy at the moment and stopping me from ODing on sleeping pills.

51," ""You're doing super well, man"" - guy who just learned about my divorce 1 year ago, and has known me for \~4-5 months.  


""On the surface, yeah."" - me  


I joke a lot. I laugh heartily multiple times a day. I bring people's spirits up. I create a fun, relaxed atmosphere in the team at work because that's the type of person that I portray.  


But the truth is, I only use humour to distract myself. Outside of the few times a day when I laugh, my thoughts are 90% dark. Either suicide, pointlessness of life, questioning my identity and character, life choices and so on. Just pure, unadulterated anxiety.  


The funny thing is, I don't even think I'm like this because of my divorce. I've always been like this. My whole marriage / relationship was just another distraction.  


Most things that make me, me, are distractions. Sports car? Distraction. Hanging out with friends? Distraction, especially if it involves alcohol / drugs. Video games / TV? Distractions. Escapes from reality.  


But everyone escapes from reality, so I'm not that special. Maybe I'm just overly self aware of it.

53,"So we are heading to my friends surprise bday tonight and I met with his brother first. On the way, we were asked to pick up food at a nice local restaurant (with many locations, sort of a fancier chain) by our friend’s releative. She said it would be ready by a certain time. We get there at that time and wait about 30-40 min (asking a few times). They finally said it would be out soon, but about 10-15 min later my friend says let’s go, and she’ll have to pick it up (the one who ordered). He didn’t mention anything to pickup/restaurant workers. I was sweating and not feeling great so I just left with him when he said we were leaving.

I texted her to call and pick up the food because we were running late. She decides she’s too late and calls and says she’s not getting it. They tell her we were just there and it was ready (maybe seconds after we left). 

Ever since I realized she didn’t get it I’ve been anxious and upset. I’m assuming the order was about $100+ and now the restaurant doesn’t get that money and now there’s wasted food. 

1. Does/can the restaurant reuse this food? It was a few different apps I believe. No idea on quantity or types. 

2. Does someone have to eat this cost other than the owner? Any of the workers? 

3. Since we stood there for 30-40 min are we on some type of surveillance camera video? Is there anything we can be tracked down for?

4. My main feelings of upset is the wasted food (if somehow not repurposed), the business losing money, and really just the fact my friend’s brother didn’t say a word when we left. I don’t want to be known as “that guy”. 

I thought about calling or visiting and apologizing but it wasn’t even my order. I was just there with the person who was picking it up. Just there for the ride/pickup. 

Am I overthinking this? At first I thought the restaurant would have a video of us and potential in trouble with the law or even banned from the establishment?

They were quite busy when we left so I hope they were able to use that food.

It may start out as bittersweet but quickly turns depressing. I’ll look at anything from photos to archived news clips to imagery that kind of captures the aesthetics of it all, and other things that remind me of that period of my life.

57,"I’ve been in a handful of relationships throughout my lifetime, and I’ve been cheated on in most of them which caused them to end. I grew up in a shitty household with an alcoholic absent father and an insane mother, grew up being abused and i’ve been suffering from depression, anxiety, bipolar issues and dermatilomania my whole life. With my ‘daddy issues’ and other shit I went through, I sought validation from people around me and love from men who weren’t so great. I noticed a few years ago that I have commitment issues, meaning yes I would get into relationships but I would also always look around and keep wandering, to some extent I believe that’s normal but recently for me it’s been out of control. I am currently in a relationship and i’m happy, I love him very much and I can imagine marrying him and I really really want to, but i’ve been also talking to other guys, not continuously but once in a while i’d fuck around, and then feel terribly guilty afterwards, like a month ago, I sent nudes to a guy friend I have, I have never even had feeling for him and would never imagine him as more than a friend, but I still did it and have no idea why!

I’m so stuck on my ex. First love. First relationship. Told we don’t have time right now and we will come back to it after college. “I know for a fact that we will try again” —him. We’re a little over a year in. Our mutual friend tells me “He told me he doesn’t know what he wants.” Why do I even try? Like seriously. I’m getting screwed over and I still love him like it was the first day we said I love you. He won’t talk to me. He won’t tell me what he thinks. Won’t tell me it’s over and to move on. 
There’s another guy that I knew from HS. He’s a total sweetheart and cares about me. 
But my ex... What if he comes back like he said he knew we would. But then again what if he doesn’t. 
But then the other guy... said this’ll be too difficult you moved a few hours away. But he also told me I would be the one if I wasn’t so far... I don’t want to move back home though. I can’t. 
Why is finding the one so difficult. I thought I did with my ex. Talked about getting married and having kids. He brought it up. He was excited. Told me I was his world... and then told me he wanted to be young and dumb in college and didn’t want me to worry about him. 
I’m not fine. I’m not okay. I wish I was and I didn’t care so much. I gave all my love to him. Then the guy I knew from HS came along and slowly healed me until he said this will be too hard.

60,"I had a very bad past. A lot of trama which lead to me getting to addictions like porn and video games etc. and during the process my therapist and I knew that I was seeking someone else to fulfill my needs because I felt if I got into a relationship I would be perfect.

65,"I worked for a company that required me to go into peoples homes sometimes for hours at a time unsupervised. That was a lot of trust for a company, as well as the customers, to put into me and I’m here to admit I didn’t always live up to the expectation.

I stole. Infrequently and only when the family seemed to be free of want, but I still stole. For a long time that was as far as it went. A fancy pen, a cold drink, a game, a movie, and even a bath towel for no real reason. I don’t know why I stole what I didn’t need or even want in most cases but I did. It created a bit of excitement in a job that often had none.

Stealing isn’t my confession thought. if stealing fulfilled some kind primal need to be unseen, what I did next would fulfill that need 10 fold and for years to come:

It started when I went to a woman’s apartment almost 5 years ago. It could be a little longer than five years because I don’t remember the exact date, all I remember is the air had just started to turn cool and the first of the leaves were beginning to fall onto my work truck overnight. I pulled up to the apartment, checked my notes and knocked on the door.

I’m not one to overestimate beauty. I would tell you if this girl was just good looking or even beautiful but that wasn’t the case. This girl was drop-dead gorgeous. I’ve met a lot of pretty women, worked for a lot of pretty women, slept with a few pretty women, but none of them compared to this woman who I will call Catrina. 

Catrina was just under six feet tall and the best way I can describe her is Kesha. Think of Kesha—dirty blonde hair, distinct facial features, don’t-really-care attitude—but with a certain wow factor unlike anyone I had ever encountered. 

I was speechless. I don’t have trouble talking to women, especially in a business environment, but the entire time I was in her home I could barely utter a word. There was no smalltalk only awkward pleasantries and then I was off to work.

The job was a small one. I was only there for about an hour so she didn’t leave the apartment. Truth be told I would have jumped at the opportunity to go through her things to learn anything I could about her but being crammed in a one bedroom apartment didn’t leave me with many opportunities.

My curiosity was killing me so I pretended to take a call and stepped outside to google her. Her name brought forth several results: a Facebook page, a twitter account, an Instagram and other standard social media accounts. Then, on the second or third page I found a result titled “2011 miss ******* beauty contest finalist” The woman was literally a beauty queen and I was in her home. 

The same primal urge that made me want to steal kicked in and I knew I had to do something. I didn’t hit on her or anything else devious you might be imagining right now but I did recognize that I had a distinct opportunity that would never come again.

At the end of my work I was required to assist her with setting up an online account for our service as well as show her how the system I had just installed worked. I took a gamble. I was supposed to give her my tablet and have her create her own account that I would never see, but instead I asked her what she would like her email and password to be.

Without hesitation she gave them to me. I prayed so hard that this was the password she used for everything. I said my goodbyes to the most beautiful woman I had ever seen and went on my way.

When I got to my truck I instantly pulled out my personal laptop and went to her email. The password got me in instantly and I knew I had hit the jackpot. Over the next few days I would proceed to comb through every last social media account I could find from the inside. I looked at her emails, Facebook messages, DMs and everything else that gave me a strange sense of satisfaction. It became my obsession for the next few weeks and I became a social recluse. I called out of work, cancelled dinner plans with friends and didn’t leave the house for days. I spent hours at a time just reading messages between her and everyone you can imagine: Family members, love interests, exes, old friends, current friends, religious figures etc.

I learned so much about Catrina in the few weeks of slinking through her accounts that I began to feel like I knew her on an intimate level. I knew her favorite movies, books, and songs. I knew who her friends were and what they liked to do together. I knew her relationship with her parents and extended family and even her romantic relationships. 

Catrina even had a secret that took me a few weeks to discover. Inside her cloud drive, in a folder that had been labeled innocently, was a collection of nudes and selfies that would become my obsession for years. Nude mirror selfies, topless shots from above, duckface shots as she pinched her own nipples.

I loved her. I wasn’t just obsessed with her anymore, I was in love with a girl I had only spoken to for about an hour.

At some point she realized someone was in her accounts and started changing passwords. I was devastated but thankful it took as long as it did. I had saved the photos, lists of her friends and family, and everything else I wanted to remember. Those photos in particular would be my fantasy fuel for years.

Over the following years and up until today I continued to follow her silently on her social media accounts. She lives in a different state and owns her own business now. I have the strongest desire to fly to her and see her new place. I want to walk through it and see what else I can learn about Katrina. I want to bring Print-outs of her nudes and lay them on the counter without breaking eye contact. I want her to know I exist.

I won’t. I know if I did I wouldn’t even know what to say to her yet again. Age hasn’t harmed her looks in any way, In fact, she continues to grow even more beautiful to this day. Despite all my intimate knowledge of her and who she is not only on the surface but also to her friends and family, I know I would still would not be able to speak to her. 

I would prefer to remember her not as a person, but more as a hobby. Like and old movie I haven’t seen in a while or an ex that I would like to call but won’t. Instead of going to her and exposing myself, I will be here, a thousand miles away, behind a computer, watching her forever.",20Oct2019,0

To elaborate here as a child I was diagnosed with very mild aspergers and I worked quite hard to overcome social awkwardness . I present essentially completely neurotypically now. As a result I’m kinda hypersensitive to when people are acting socially awkward, it makes me cringe very hard and not wanna associate with that person.

73,"I (15F) never really cared for my eyebrows. I’d make sure that they wouldn’t get too out of hand, but I never tried actually doing them to make them look really nice. But recently, an eyebrow tutorial got recommended to me on YouTube, and I suddenly became very interested in trying to do them! 

So yesterday, I did it. I tweezed them, and cut them, and tried to make them look very nice and neat. The thing is... I overdid it!! My eyebrows literally look like they’re    b a l d i n g !  Especially the right one lmao. It honestly looks like it suffered from severe hair loss.

I colored them in, and they look a lot better now, but I’m honestly so mad at myself for going overboard with it. And the thing is, I stopped at one point while doing them, and I thought “Hmm, they look really good right now, but I wanna make them even BETTER” and now I seriously regret not stopping when they already looked nice. 

My mom says that they look good when I color them in. I think they look pretty good too, but I’m nervous that lots of people at school are gonna be like “Woooooow did you do your eYEbRowS?!” 

Lmao this whole situation is just kinda whack, but I definitely wanna try doing them again next time they grow out. But that time, I will try to do a better job. Practice makes perfect, right?",20Oct2019,3
74,"Broke up with my long term girlfriend because I was exhausted by the work it was taking and I felt like she wasn’t putting the work in. Moved to Seoul, Korea thinking it would be an amazing change of pace and scenery. I love learning languages (learned 3 so far), and I thought my Korean was up to snuff enough to move over here and learn some more. I had dreams of moving here, becoming (semi) fluent, rediscovering myself, and learning what it’s like to be single after nearly 4 years in a relationship. I thought this was going to be a life changing adventure. 

Instead.... I’m missing my ex, regretting this move, feeling isolated, depressed, and lonely. I have no friends or family out here. Some days I don’t even eat because it’s easier to skip meals than have a stranger be unable to understand me. I can’t figure out what anything says or what anyone is saying to me. I don’t know what any of the food is on a menu. I can read WHAT is says but I don’t know what those sounds all mean. 

I live for 10pm, which is when people at home start to wake up so that I can actually have some human interaction. I’m constantly depressed, and even when I drag myself out of the apartment I can’t do anything or go anywhere because I literally can’t figure out what places are what. I’m usually back in the apartment by 6 or 7 pm. I don’t have work or classes, it’s just me, alone, wandering the streets of a city I feel lost in. I’ve tried so hard. I’ve been studying every day and trying to learn new words and thinking I’m actually getting somewhere. And then I’ll attempt to do anything in real time, and it all comes crashing down. I had a one night stand for the first time this weekend and it just made me realize what an idiot I’ve been. And I feel like I’ve cheated on my ex even though we’ve been broken up more than a month. And now I feel like she’d never take me back anyway because I’ve hurt her too badly. 

I feel like I’m drowning in all of this dread and isolation, in a country I don’t speak the language of, being alone for the first Tim’s in my adult life, wondering if I should just cancel my lease, move back home, and accept defeat. My best friend was my ex, so I can’t even talk to anyone about all this, and I feel like I’ve ruined my life.",20Oct2019,1
75,"My girlfriend and I were riding bikes on a bike path, when we came across a guy who was on the ground on the side of the path next to a busted scooter. There was blood everywhere. He was conscious but unresponsive. We called 911 and stayed with him until they got there. My girlfriend talked to him the whole time, making sure he stayed awake, and was the one who knew what to do since she’s good in a crisis, while I tried to not freak out. I was surprised how emotional I felt myself getting just seeing someone in that condition.

We couldn’t find his phone but got his name from his drivers license...I set out on a campaign to find his wife’s Facebook so I could let her know ASAP what had happened. I eventually find her page and then website/email and send her a message...

...well she calls this morning. He’s in very bad shape it sounds. Severe brain injury and they don’t know if he’s going to recover. She was just a mess on the phone. I feel so, so bad, especially since my brother just lost his young wife suddenly about a year ago, and I had a front row seat for that. I know this stuff happens all the time in a big city, and I know I did all I could, but I can’t stop thinking about them...I’ve never been so close to something like this before.",20Oct2019,9

I'm 21, I still live with my parents, I have a partner who lives far away, enough to make it difficult to meet a few times a year. I know this sounds stupid but ever since I was little people have told me I will end up a failure, and live in the streets. I grew up and still am in a pretty poor household, just barely scraping by. I've learned to hate money because of this... I don't have any mental disabilities that make me particularly dumb, I was never academically smart, I've always felt like I'm just too lazy. I just recently graduated from highschool because my family and I have moved so much that it reset a few years of my education because we always moved at the ''wrong'' times of the year.  


So here I am, a guy with a highschool diploma and a profession in hairdressing. I barely graduated. Failed attempts in getting a job at all. My parents tell me that a child of failed parents will be a failure too. Apple doesn't fall far from it's tree.

80,"Becuase of the massive impact and changes and alterations these crimes have had on the natural course of my life I will never ""let it go"". Not until Justice is served and those who abused there power are behind bars.

Any man who stalks another man for over 4 years is a closeted homosexual or a psycopath. John H panowich military veteran now gangstalker must be placed in prison or I will not be satisfied.

He along with many others. I have evidence of military personel  wiretaping my phone calls and my famalies phone calls to listen to conversation in order to make ""directed conversations"" later. 

I have more than enough evidence against many people and have began talks about legal avenues to pursue.

I had a manager whose voicemails etc were all coming directly to my phone and it made me wonder. Why was I getting voicemails from some man u dont know who I only work for? You have to give contact unfo upon employment so your number will always be in their possesion. Again predatory obsessive closeted men so obsessed with me that they wanted to take the stalking to the next level and tried doing some type of shenanigans with my phone number.

With all the names addresses times sates info employment records flight logs and social media activity it should become clear upon any internal investigations the link between individuals specified and the programs and positions abused to help the facilitation of  these crimes.

There is now aufio and visual evidence and a court record will serve as a key piece of information.

These crimes were so wicked and so evil in nature that I will cast my kind and caring nature to the side and be mercilous in my pursuit of the incrimination and incarceration of all parties involved.

Weaponizing programs created to serve the public for the intention of carrying out crimes for the purposes of theft, jealousy, rape, entrapment, hate crimes, and simple entertainment and pleasure fir psycopaths.

I can only imagine the countkess anerican citizens whose lives have been forever changed by the domestic terrorism being aided from security agencies leo, and worthless military personel who tout speeches about freedom and rights they put themselves on the line for while showing how full of shit they are everyday they remain silent about these crimes and commit them for a check.

They are disgraces and they have no respect for those better than they who died to fight against these things not the other way around.

This involves a cult established and built upon from a university fraternity as well.

These crimes are the equivalent of being raped in a cold dark room by dozens of people only to survive step outside the building you were raoed at and be called a liar or dellusional by the rest of the world as the rapists move on to continue to do what they do.

You must be strong, fearless, unafraid, armed to the teth, intellegent and also cunning.

You must also be able to level a ritcheous kevel of cold heartedness and mercilousness and unwavering lack of empathy for those whoe chose to partake on such crimes. They deserve no empathy only death.

If the person raped in the corner by a dozen people only to be called dellusional or a liar continues to accept those false labels being placed on them by an ignorant uncaring society how can they ever establish justice fir themselves?

Sometimes the truth is that which must be FORCED to be acknowledged.

82,"I’ve had so much on my mind lately and it’s so overwhelming. When this year began I was in a very dark place and I realized I needed to get my shit together and take care of myself because I DESERVED to be happy. And I did. It took trial and error (I quit my job bc of the amount of stress it caused me and took a mental health break for three months, then decided to go back until I could figure out what I really needed to do). I worked third shift for a few months and I had a lot of time on my hands so I did a lot of thinking. I finally left that job and got a new one, one I was really excited about (mostly bc it was a change of pace and a bigger store and I felt I was challenging myself by doing something different.) I was doing so good back in May and June. I really did like my new job and that’s when I met my current girlfriend and we started talking. I was taking decent care of myself and felt confident for the first time in a long time.

Then something changed. My new job was showing the same patterns as my old job, and I ended up leaving a few weeks ago out of fear that it would drive me right back to where I was. I no longer loved it and I dreaded going to work, even called in a few times because I couldn’t handle it. I had so much anxiety going in there. I didn’t want that stress to take a toll on me or my relationship so I left and got a job with my former supervisor from the old job.

I’ve been there for a week and it’s been really hard to adjust. I’m going to be making bigger paychecks here (which is partly why I left) and working third shift again. The first few days were rough but I’m slowly getting used to it. It’s just so lonely. I only know a handful of people, and I miss certain parts of my old job. I know that me changing jobs again will be good for me, I just can’t seem to forgive myself because I don’t like leaving jobs shortly after starting. I don’t like that it didn’t work out like I had planned. But I felt like I had no choice; the opportunity came to me right when I was at my breaking point at the last job and I was scared if I turned it down I’d be making a big mistake.

Besides work though, mentally I’ve been struggling for a few months. I’ve noticed every time I start to feel good and better about myself, it lasts for a month or two and then it goes back to the way it was. I’ve gone through a lot of changes this year; my friend passed away unexpectedly, my grandma’s been in and out of the hospital, I’ve had three different jobs, there’s been a lot of family drama, I shelved a book I’d been writing for two years and decided to start a new one, and I’ve fallen in love and I’ve made and lost a lot of friends. Rationally I know that things will clear up and right now there’s just so much going on that it feels like I can’t breathe. I realized the other day that I’m not happy. I started going back to therapy a while ago and my therapist is really good, I’ve been seeing her for four years and she knows my history unlike any other therapist I’ve seen. I had to cancel my last appointment because I wasn’t feeling well that day and I’m going to call and reschedule tomorrow.

But I just feel like I am so mentally drained and I haven’t been myself. Some days are okay, some days are bad. Yesterday was really good, my girlfriend and her family took me with them to Holiday world and we had a blast. But as soon as I got home I just realized how fucking depressed I am, and I can’t figure out why.

I put so much fucking pressure on myself. And there’s been a lot of family drama going on this week that’s really got me thinking about my childhood and how I haven’t worked through all my issues. I’ve just ignored them and literally blocked them out so I wouldn’t care, but deep down it hurts because I just keep thinking about all the fucked up things I went through as a child.

I’ve felt for a long time that I need intensive therapy, more than just once every two or three weeks. I’ve thought about going back on medication but I’ve tried so many different ones and I haven’t been on meds since a year or two ago. But all this stress makes me anxiety go up and my self esteem go down, and I stop caring about my passions and my interests and everyday just feels like a blur. And I know I have to work, I have to get myself back to a financially stable spot. I feel like I’m not as bad as I could be and have been, But my mental health has been a priority to me this year, and I don’t know what to do to take care of it. I feel like I’m drowning, but somehow still pulling through and acting like everything is fine. It’s like every time someone asks me if I’m okay, I just automatically nod and tell them yes, I’m fine, and then change the subject because as much as I WANT to talk about it, I really fucking don’t because I don’t have the words. I don’t know how to explain what’s going on in my head right now.

I’m sorry. I just needed to vent. I know this is a lot and it’s kind of vague (because it’s just so much to go into it so I’m sorry if it’s all over the place) I just really want to get better and I don’t know how. I don’t want to be the person to push everyone away. I want to be happy, I want to be where I was mentally back in May and June. I want to actually feel alive, and right now it just feels like I’m in this bubble and I don’t know how I got here. I just want to feel better. I’ve waited my whole life to live authentically and happy, and I know it’s not going to be perfect all the time. But I’m not happy and I feel like it’s all just been so much change and so much go go go go go and I haven’t had time to process it all. I even took a few days off before starting my new job so I could relax and recharge, but it really didn’t do much help. I feel guilty that I’m not happy. And I don’t know what it’s going to take to get me there again.

I don’t know what to do. My mental health has been shit for the last few months and I just want to feel better. I want to BE better. Why can’t I just be happy and stop letting my anxiety control everything? My brain never stops. It’s exhausting and I don’t know what to do 😞",20Oct2019,2
83,"Lately I’ve been trying to push myself socially: forcing myself to have little conversations with people when I’d have stayed quiet before, just little things to build up my confidence which I’ve always lacked. Not that I’m some kind of anti-social basement dweller; I go out a lot with my friends, but I just don’t go out my way to meet new people, and especially don’t put myself out there when it comes to girls I’m attracted to. Last night I was at a club with some friends, and usually on a night out the idea of talking to a good looking stranger would terrify me, but last night I tried to push myself. There was this group of girls who were talking amongst themselves about who was gonna take their group photo, so being pretty drunk and trying to be more social I offered to take the picture for them.

My recollection of this is a little blurry cause I overdone it a bit last night, but after I took the picture I got talking to one of the girls for a little bit. It was the girl who’s phone I took the picture on, so we got talking when I handed her it back. It was only for a few minutes, but I very much remember there being like an insanely flirty undertone. Like we were having a normal conversation, but you could just kind of sense the tension I suppose. It was in the eye contact I think, and the fact we were standing closer to each other than we really had to.

Anyway, her and her friends go to leave, and as she leaves she gives me a quick peck on the lips. I was kind of taken aback, it actually lasted for maybe a couple of seconds longer than just your average quick peck. When that was done I kind of looked at her and laughed, and kind of light heartedly said ‘for a minute I thought that was gonna turn into something more there’. She said that she wasn’t the type to go around making out with strangers, but she asked to get my Snapchat or Instagram username to add me.

This is where my recollection gets a little hazy again. I’m pretty sure I gave her the right details, but the thing is, she never added me. It was kind of weird actually. Usually in this situation I’d think to myself that she was just trying to get away from me and didn’t actually want to add me at all and just said that to end the conversation, but the fact she gave me that quick kiss and actually was the one to bring up adding me in the first place made me think she must have been interested. Today I’ve just kind of been wondering what I done wrong, if anything. Like did she just forget somehow, or am I remembering things wrong and she was actually feeling creeped out and didn’t want to add me or whatever? I’m just scared in case I don’t remember it right and I was pestering her in some way to add me or whatever. I don’t think that’s the case in all honesty, because I remember at the time feeling so confident because she’d instigated all this, but I can’t shake the feeling that I must have done something wrong for her not to add me, even if at the time I thought things were going well. I think it might just be my lack of self confidence refusing to let me believe that she was actually interested and not creeped out by the idea of flirting with me (it’s sad, but I just never really have had many people openly flirt with me or he attracted to me at like first sight), but the whole thing has confused me quite a bit. At the time it was a big confidence boost, but the more I think about it the more it’s kind of just getting me down instead.",20Oct2019,2

But what if I DO let my inks bleed into eachother? So what if this paper isn't suited for acrylics? I like to test myself. Throughout the years of making art, I've been gathering knowledge of how different mediums and media work together. For me, it's fun going through the creative process because there's always something new to learn and apply/experiment. I'm in love with the unconventional since I work very intuitively. Breaking boundaries is the good sauce. I think doing this with my own art gives it more character, and I feel a deeper connection with some of them because of that. Just wanted to geek out.

Ever since I was young I’ve always been curious about death. What happens when you die? How does it feel like? Who would care? All those things. 

One time I hung a wire like a noose from my ceiling and placed my head on it just to see. So if I were to have walked off my chair I would’ve died.

I also always thought of dying from getting in car accidents or getting stabbed in the middle of the night. Not just me but my friends and family. Even sometimes fully convincing myself a loved one died even when they were alive and well. 

I’ve never told my family members about this because they might think i’m being overdramatic and well I’m the youngest out of my cousins and siblings and I’m always happy around them I’m basically like the kid of all of us. So they would think I’m “to innocent” to have those thoughts. But they occur everyday.

A man that would push his needs aside for someone else. Im only 19F and i get thats young but you would think that at least one man would’ve given me hope by now. For the past few months I’ve been talking to my one friend 19M and he started giving me hope. He would call me almost every day because he wanted to talk to me. We would talk about everything and his views on feminism, his respect for woman and how fucked up society can be towards woman. He gave me so much hope and i felt like i could trust him and that he was just being himself and then i started hanging out with him in person again and saw him just putting up a act to be accepted by everyone around him and i lost hope again.

What I call ""my first love"" and I broke up this last February. It was a tumor, literally. I loved her more than anything else. As I was raised in a very closed society, Saudi Arabia, It was hard to treat people from the other sex (females). So, if someone knew a girl, he will literally take her as his everything in his life. He will take her as a mom, daughter, sister, friend, and wife. I got to know my ex back in 2017. We were literally texting everyday and every hour. I was so jealous sometimes and didn't want her to do some stuff she wanted to do, and this was so bad from me, I admit it. I used to control her, but I swear it was unintentionally done as I loved her so much. The main problem is, She sometimes used to send me some pictures and videos just to seduce me. I started masturbating on these pictures and stopped watching porn. Now, we broke up as she cheated. I got over the ""love after the first 5 months. Right now, I only stalk her just to get new pictures and fantasize about her. I can't stop stalking. I paid money for people claiming they can hack her snap-chat in order for me to see her pictures, but I just lost money out of that. I tried going to a therapy but I just went once and it's a lot of money. I just enjoy so much looking at her pics. Even though we didn't talk since 10 months.

Unfortunately for me, it turns out it was all a scam. I find it rather telling that, in all this time, the closest thing I've managed to get a job... It was all a scam. That should tell you all you need to know.

Then, finally I thought I had found someone who actually want to hire me after all this time... I was so excited for a few days. The salary and the hours were nice, way better than expected (to the point where I thought it was too good to be true). But I still had hope. 

Unfortunately for me, it turns out it was all a scam. I find it rather telling that, in all this time, the closest thing I've managed to get a job... It was all a scam. That should tell you all you need to know.

And you know what... I quit looking for a job. I'm sick and tired of this nonsense. I will embrace being a NEET. It's been almost 2 years of nothing but rejections. What a waste of my bloody time. Instead of worrying about this crap, I will just keep doing what I've been doing best for these years: just chill in my room, watch anime, read manga/LN/VN and ocasionally play some video games. Just this time, I won't be worrying about looking for a job. It's far more relaxing and freeing to live this way.",20Oct2019,3
104,"A doctor said I might be stressed. He said I should take counceling. (I had been 6-7 months late for my period)
Another doctor (gynocologist) said nope not at all, definitely not, she was mean anyways, I didn't like her. 

Point is.
I feel like IDK what I should do with my life. As in career wise
I haven't been organized and using my time wisely
I have been procrastinating
I have been avoiding hw (which is pretty easy)
I have not combed my hair (for 2 days) in my defense there was no school. 
I haven't showered. (In 2-3 days same reason)
I haven't washed my hair in 2 weeks (coz the shower was too cold n I couldn't do it). 

So yeah. Do you think I might be stressed or something? Coz I certainly am not sad or unhappy. 

I just. I don't know.
I try to look at the good things in life and focus on the present but I need to focus on the future. I need to figure out what job I want.

Doctor takes too long but it is a set job
Psychologist is fun and easy and might give me time to study too but my sister says I have potential for something better. Plus the job market for that is slim
My sister wants me to go into business but I feel like that might not work out. I could study extra hard and pass but IDK

I also like physics but I don't wanna be doing research for the rest of my life coz what if I fail? 

Help me someone. Plz",20Oct2019,2
105,"Bear in the big blue house is one of my kids favorite shows. He is missing 3 from his collection. There is a 99% chance you will fail this treasure hunt, but if you succeed in finding even 2 out of the 3 of these episodes in english and in at least VHS quality, I will give you any spare desktop PC I have that you want for free, or 100 bucks.

Note: since I fix desktops and laptops, I have quite a few spare laying around. I know this hunt will fail probably, but rest assured I will find a way to compensate the winner, if any.

Season 4 Episode 13 - Appreciation Day

Season 5 Episode 3 - Great Ball of Firefighters

106,"My mom just said, ""Thank you for being you."" in a somewhat sad voice, and I feel like crying now, both out of feeling appreciated and knowing that there is probably something wrong.",20Oct2019,14
107,"I feel like an eggshell fragment congealed in a partially cooked quiche. Why are Sunday afternoons like this? Maybe it was always meant to be this way and human existence ultimately boils down to this gelatinous mass of existential funk and loneliness.   
Autumn sunlight streams through the blinds. I stepped outside when my brother came home and the warm breeze made me want to cry. Most days, I tell myself it'll get better after high school, that people I have yet to meet will save me, that the future is laughing with someone who makes me temporarily forget about climate change. I tell myself we'll drive past golden fields of canola or bake cookies or look at cool rocks together and say a silent ""fuck you"" to the creeping surreal dread. But on afternoons like these, the illusion sails through the window and I feel so extraordinarily stuck in time that I both want to crawl into bed and be violently slapped awake.",20Oct2019,3

110,"I have been talking with this girl for months now and even though we're miles and miles apart we talk nearly every day and some days I stay up talking to her even when I really need to sleep. 

She's the most gorgeous girl I've ever seen and every time I see her face I just feel so much happier. I keep her picture on my phone so I have something to look forward to when I wake up in the morning and when the day isn't going great.

I tell her all this and while I worry she doesn't believe me it's the truth. We both have low self esteem but I want to work my hardest just for her. Her hair, her eyes a gorgeous ocean blue, her smile lights up like the moon.  I feel like a slob in comparison but she doesn't care.


Best of all? She actually likes me. Actual mutual attraction! Yeah there's 5000 miles between us but so what? We like each other and that's all that matters for now.

I don't know where this will go but I really hope it works out for both of us.",20Oct2019,5
111,"The phone call won’t lead to any super exciting drama, but I could come out of it feeling either really really good or really really bad. There’s a short post with background information in my post history if you’re interested.

I’ll edit this post to tell y’all what happened after I get off the phone. Hopefully I won’t get his voicemail.",20Oct2019,0
