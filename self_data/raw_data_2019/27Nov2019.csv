Going to a below-average school.

For an average career.

Working a below-average job.

With average intelligence.

Average skills.

I knew since I was a kid that I’d never be something insane like a model or an actress or a singer or even something lifesaving like a doctor. I’d be stuck in some mundane job.
I knew I didn’t have what it takes to be anything more than average.

There will always be someone smarter, more beautiful, faster, stronger, better.

3,"Sooo it's uh, my birthday today. I remember being pretty upset no one knew nor celebrated it for like nearly 5 years after my mum passed away but today it doesn't hurt at all surprisingly enough 

I'd remember being especially upset over supposed friends and family don't remember but I'm fine with it like surprisingly completely fine - usually it'd hurt a bit but this time it doesn't and I guess that means I've finally become an adult hey coming to terms that the world ain't gonna revolve around you on your birthday no more 

Tough lesson to swallow back then, doesn't faze me anymore although 

Surprisingly enough, one of the family member (dad and his new beau or rather first ex wife now back again - confusing aint it) did remember and I bet it's because my niece's birthday (my stepsister's kid) is an exact month apart that they remember it this time. I got a short brief call a bit terse but it was alright. 

Got asked what I'm doing for my birthday and I said eh I'll celebrate in the weekend which isn't false lol I'll probably just hit the gym, then eat something at home, then watch a film - so all in all, a normal weekend except I'm now 21 which is. Something I suppose

Today, I'm just to just go to the city for taste testing Krispy Kreme, get home, have dinner, prep for a test tomorrow, and then sleep 

Ah I've got cats and they're silly felines that are soothing to just... Watch them get hyper and run around or just chilling haha 

Thought I'd get if off my chest here and well, sure I've gotten on friendlier terms with classmates and all but I don't feel like pushing it or coming on aggressively since they've all more or less already got a life (got a husband one of the ones I get along most with for one! Others live far off / don't really get along superbly just okay so not really a pal I want to get smashed with) and saying it's my birthday when I barely know them a month in is just awkward lol  I've tried reaching out to some old folks a few weeks back and met them once and another will tell me when to meet since they're exhausted after just moving and another I'll have a sleepover with this weekend so there be that 

So I'll be spending my actual birthday today chilling, and having fun exploring all the healthy dishes I can make as a vegan, been regrowing some plants in water and it's fun to see :) head out a bit come back and prep for an exam tomorrow :) have a good day everyone haha",27Nov2019,1
4,"i live in Arizona, and frequently there will be a man sitting at the corner of the intersection near my house on top of those little electrical boxes, happy as can be, kicking his legs with a cardboard sign that says ""Just Smile!"". he waves to the passing cars, and nothing makes him happier than seeing the passerby smile. sometimes he'll be vibing out with his little six-string (that he's had people he met along his travels sign!!) which was always really cool to me, too. 

 it gets hellishly hot here, so i always worry when he vanishes during the peak of the summer months, but without fail he shows back up in the evening, or when the weather cools. there's a cold snap going on however, so when i saw him as i was leaving the gas station i jumped at the opportunity to offer him something warm to drink or eat. 

when i asked him though, he just looked so touched and said, ""no, thank you!"" i insisted and without missing a beat, he said ""well there is one thing. do you have a smile?"" and god, i couldn't help myself, i burst out grinning. and he said ""there! that's all i need. i'm a happy camper if i can just get people to smile!"" 

he asked my name &amp; introduced himself as Squirrel! we went on to talk for a little bit, with him the whole while opening the door for people passing in/out of the gas station and apologizing when he couldn't get to it in time. he told me that he's been travelling for over 25 years, and that he's been to every city in every state except for utah. and that every time someone even acknowledges his existence, or looks and honks &amp; smiles, he feels absolutely blessed that someone cares enough to ""give a love"" (in his words, since he doesn't care for cursing lol). he also said that, no matter how much he tries to leave san tan valley, he always ends right back, because to him, the people are some of the best he's met. 

what got me the most was when, before he went to get his stuff from the gas station, he told me ""ALotOfTeeth, i recognize you! it makes me so happy to see you when you drive by. thank you so much for coming to talk to me, people like you make everything worth it.""

i have never in my life met someone so wholly genuine and pure! something about him just absolutely shook me to my core, and after i sat down in my car i bawled like a baby. not out of sorrow, but just because he was so. amazing, and good, and wholesome. he reminded me that there ARE good people like him, and honestly, he was right. seeing people happy, even if it's just a smile, really does make everything worth it. i really needed that reminder to be as kind as possible, no matter what, especially with all the stress going on in my life. i think if everyone was a bit like Squirrel, the world would be such a better place. 

tl;dr met the local nomad named Squirrel, and had a conversation that left me bawling like a baby from the happy feels.",27Nov2019,1

8,"That is an understatement.

I think sometimes I forget that -- for me -- life is precious and unpredictable. The time spent worrying about what other people think of you or being discontent could be spent being content and enjoying the people around you. This is, easier said than done for someone like myself but it's about the time spent and what we'll do with that time that's important. Nobody has long and we must all make the most of what we can from our lives here and now and sometimes, I worry or get anxious not just about the people around me but that i'm going to waste my time here. Who knows if we get a second chance or not? Who knows if there is an afterlife? If you ask me we should all prepare for the worst come scenario and that is that nothing happens and this is the only shot we got.

I've had this fantasy my whole life that I would love to be ageless. So you can still die if you're shot or something but you don't age and you live forever to see the sun inhale the earth and the gods themselves. But that is a fairytale and I am a cashier. I have a friend, his name is George and he is 58. He is paid a small amount every month because he has a personality disorder, it is a third of what I make every month. Any day I could choose to leave my job and live like George.

Take what you will from what I have wrote but i'm worried, I don't know if either of those choices, to be like George, to be a cashier, the difference in monerity value and income -- I don't know if I want either of those things. Both are equally as bad and George lives in a mess of a house and hasn't had a shower in years. He's a great friend but if his situation isn't better than mine even though im on three times the income then something is wrong.

I know people do it and I know some will think that you can just do it but you can't just pack up and go and live in the woods because you felt like you were wasting your life working away the 9-5. Im really tempted I am but I think even then it wouldn't be what I truly wanted.

I know what I want.  I want it to end.

How can my greatest fantasy be to be ageless when all I truly want in the whole world is to be non-existant, to not feel to not be.",27Nov2019,1

12,"I just came back from a new moon intention meditation class with singing bowls. It was very soothing and relaxing hearing the crystal bowls and positive energy and vibrations whirl around the room and into my body. 

I set my intentions for this new moon: Health, wealth and happiness. 

Health: I’m going to start running again. Bought new shoes already, but need to start. I will most likely go tomorrow morning. I am visualizing myself smoke free, running, breathing better, feeling more energized and strong. I also want to take up kickboxing to let off some built up stress from these past few years. 
Emotionally healthy: no more depression, no more anxiety, no more worrying about EVERYTHING. I will let things go and come as they will and not try to hold on to or avoid them. I release my issues of control. 
Emotional health: I will find a loving partner who are emotionally available and loving. No more passive aggressive bullshit, no more abuse of any kind, no more lies. They will be open to love, be kind and gentle, protective but self aware that I am a strong woman and I do not need them, but want them in my life. I will find more love, patience  and happiness with my family members. They will notice me being loving, patient and kind. My friends will be healthy and happy and strong and we support each other in everything we do. 

Wealth: I will land that perfect job for me with great pay and even better benefits. I will no longer have any debt, and the money that comes to me comes freely with no restrictions. I buy my own home that I love and make it mine...all mine. I decorate it with beautiful furniture and artwork. I buy a new, reliable and nice looking crossover. I love to drive it and take road trips to visit friends with no worries about time off or money. My student loans get paid off. No worries about anything financial. I start a good savings and retirement plan. I have a financial advisor who I love and trust and they make things easy to obtain. 
I have no worries about my mother. She is taken care of and she knows it. She is happy. 

Happiness: I have great friends, family and love life. I pour out happiness when I’m with people, they wonder how I became so happy. I just tell them I am. I feel free to do as I please. No restrictions with time, energy, money, fear, family obligations. I know that this is my life and I make it how I want. I travel a lot and plan new and exciting adventures I’ve never been on. I learn new talents and trust myself to make things better for myself. I take risks, and I believe that I can make it happen. And I do!
I’m reaching my career goals as well as finding my true life partner. I’m content with them, I feel safe, I feel loved and we laugh all the time. We are already happy but we make each other’s lives even better. We share the same passions, dreams and are committed fully to one another. 
I finally have my dogs that I so cherish. They greet me every time I walk in the door with love and excitement. We go for runs together and the dog park is our favorite. They are my pups and I enjoy every minute with them. 

My intentions are mine. I know they are right around the corner. I can feel them, see them and love them. Every day I get closer to my new life. I am getting closer, I already feel it taking shape. 

Thank you universe for these intentions, for listening to me and for providing them to me.",27Nov2019,1

So, here I am. Aged 21, with damages that I never thought could be fixed slowly starting to heal themselves. No, he is not the one who provided the super glue to put my heart together, rather, he gave me the tools I needed to superglue it back together myself. And for that, I am forever grateful for him.

18,"Hello users of the r/self forum,

I have been having a rough time with life recently, I had a meeting with a therapist a few weeks ago and it went well but its as if we just touch the tip of the ice berg. Her schedule is very busy and the amount of time between appointment openings are roughly a month or so apart. So I decided to make a reddit account and reach out on a forum like this one.

To give reference, I am (22M) and I am currently attending my local University as an Integrated Business major and I am trying my hand at some intro Programming classes at the same Community College I received my AA from. I am usually an A/B student (received my associates degree with a 3.4 GPA and a member of their Honors Society). I wasn't always a good student. I graduated Highschool with like a 2.6 GPA, I didn't think I was going to college as a High School student. I tried going to a different local community college right out of High School and dropped out after failing 5/5 classes. After some time after dropping out I had an epiphany my first time trying LSD. Within a week or so I was back in school and managed to bring my GPA up to said 3.4 from a 0.0. My issue now is that in this University environment I feel as if I don't necessarily fit the mold for their idea of a business student, hence my try at programming. As for the programming classes, I am completely lost. A lot of what my students and peers talk about goes way over my head, some not so much. At this point I don't really know what to do, I also feel like I am not reaching my full potential while wasting my mothers money. Currently sitting at all C's this semester. (my parents aren't rich but we would maybe be considered middle to upper middle class, they also insist on paying for my education) I try my hardest to help with expenses, but I cant justify working for a large corporation or food place for $10/hr where my ideas and thoughts are not considered in anything related to said business. I sold drugs (cannabis &amp; cannabis concentrates) thoughout a majority of my highschool and college career. This is a variable as to why I can't justify working for $10/hr when I used to make hundreds of dollars a day. I am naturally a entrepreneur, and I am aware of the increase in mental health issues with entrepreneurs. I also have only had 2-3 jobs on paper so I think that plays a part as to why I can't land a job because of my lack of experience. Through a different experience with LSD I decided that it is not worth it with the risk of being caught and creating a wrap sheet for myself so I quit selling roughly a year and a half ago. I lost many ""friends"" because of this, and reconnected with older friends that I lost contact with while I was trying to fill a persona to fit in and make quick cash. 

I have a natural skill of art but I gave up on that passion maybe 10ish years ago because that's not what the ""cool kids"" were doing and I still have good drawing skills but it is very aggravating everytime I try sketching again because I have not progressed in it in so long. I also used to be very good at basketball and used to weight train on a daily basis in highschool. I am 6'3'' and used to weigh 205 lbs and could bench press up to 285 lbs. Now I never go to the gym and am maybe 165 lbs. I have basically smoked almost everyday for the past few years and that most likely has had a direct correlation to why I am not active anymore. I also have had 1 girlfriend in my entire lifetime (lasted a year and a half in highschool but she was younger than I and we decided to breakup because our lives were going different directions) I loved this girl more than anything and I reconnected with her after not seeing or talking with her in roughly 3 years  (maybe 6-12 months ago), we went for coffee and went back to my house after. We ended up kissing as I walked her to her car, I thought that it was maybe going to go in a good direction. She told me that she wanted to be single and that she couldn't be in a relationship for a long time. Maybe a month or so after that I see on her social that she has a new DJ boyfriend and she seems generally happy. She told me before this that I deserve to have someone, that I have adjusted/matured well, and that I have fixed all the things she didn't like about me. This was kind of a tough blow but I think I have moved on from that and recently used Tinder/Bumble but I don't get any matches. I think I am pretty handsome but for a app that basically factors only your looks in has made me feel less confident in my looks and self.

Basically I have a lack of confidence in my appearance and abilities, I lack the source of income that I am used to, and the education I am pursuing doesn't necessarily feel beneficial and is causing me stress. I think i'll always be too much of a pussy to end my own life, but I do think of what it is like to not be alive. I also know that if I went through with ending my life it would end my family, and I could never do that to them. If anyone has any insight as to what I should do I am all ears. Mind you these are only the variables that I really want to put out there, if you want more information about my situation feel free to comment with a question.

for anyone who has made it this far, thank you.",27Nov2019,1
20,"Met this super amazing girl on the internet, we've been talking for a better part of a year now and I'm flying out next month to finally meet face to face. I'm very excited, but also kinda anxious.

Before we became a ""thing"" and were talking as friends, she said some things that stuck with me. She's 5'5, I'm 5'6.5""-5'7"" not quite sure. She said a few times about how there's ""nothing like physical contact with someone bigger than you"", she likes lanky guys, and that she likes to feel small. This kinda played off of my insecurity of my height, I'm a pretty small guy and probably can't make her feel the way that she talks about. I'm pretty terrified that I won't be physically satisfying, comforting, or adequate for her. We've talked a bit about my height insecurity and she tells me it's not a problem for her, but I can't be much of the stuff she stated she prefers. I don't want to bring up my insecurity and make it more of a problem than it is. Do you guys think I'm being unreasonable in my worry?

22,"To build self-confidence, we need to be strong. With a weak determination, we can never arrive anywhere. The biggest problem is, that most people have a distorted perception of strong and weak. When someone is quiet, we mistake it for weakness. When someone shouts angry, we mistake it for strength. But it's actually the opposite. Staying calm, in a disturbing situation, is what makes true self-confidence.

Other people may mistake your stillness for weakness, but this also is a big part of being strong: choosing your actions based on your values and principles, instead of the opinions and judgment of others. Your energy is not wasted on the urge to impress others, but on your desire to become the best version of yourself. A warrior is not hurt by the opinion of others but chooses to learn as much as possible from their point of view.

Unwavering confidence comes always from the inside and cannot be faked. With a calm mind, you can truly act strong. Getting angry is easy. We all do that, at least once every day. But staying calm, in the middle of a crisis; that's true strength. That's the base for true self-confidence. When you generate this level of stillness, other people will marvel at your strength; not because you turn this into a goal, but because this is an inevitable side-effect of being calm.

&gt;Certain challenges in life will cut you open like a knife. When that happens—at that exposing moment—the world gets a glimpse of what’s truly inside you.

* We don’t talk to that attractive stranger, because of what others might think of us.
* We don’t choose our passions as career paths, because of what our parents might think of us.
* We don’t talk about our feelings, because others might call us weak.

We miss out on so many opportunities because we fear what others might think of us. The pain of SHAME is rooted deep down in the opinion of others. The opinion of others is something that is outside of our *control zone*. That would mean that the only thing, which prevents us from our dreams and actions, is something that we cannot control. How unreasonable can one be to lay his life into the hand of randomness?

Of course, we lose self-confidence. Fuck the opinion of others, as long as you don't harm anybody. So, publish your YouTube video, sing your song on the street, dance your dance on the plaza, publish your book online; do all that —and much more— with the highest self-confidence, you can generate. As long as you don't harm anybody with it, you will always create a surplus of value and make this earth a better place.

But without self-confidence, joy becomes impossible. Everything becomes filled with fear of the potential future and regrets of the painful past.

# Low Self-Esteem

My whole life, I struggled with many things. Today I can say that one of the biggest factors, for my struggle, was my lack of self-confidence. To this day, I continue to struggle with self-confidence, but I learned to deal with it in different ways. When I fear the uncertain future — exams, presentations, results, potential outcomes, people’s reactions to my *awkward* behavior — I try to remember that this is only imagination, created by my own mind in this very moment; and that the actual problem is my lack of control over my own mind. This way I take responsibility for everything that happens in my life, not blaming other people and circumstances, which are outside my control zone. Let’s become self-confident in our own ability to solve every challenge, which life throws at us.

&gt;If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.  
&gt;

Knowing yourself and your enemies (the situations that take your self-confidence) is the best way to increase confidence in yourself.

I'm constantly on edge here, in a heightened state of anxiety, and can't think straight. The tiniest things set me off into fight or flight mode. When my family isn't mad, they say that I should never blame myself for their dysfunction, but when they ARE mad, it's ""only because \[throwawayaccount\] is home for the holidays"" (of course they say it behind my back, but loud enough for me to hear).

I feel so disappointed in myself. When they slam doors to get a reaction out of me, I slam them louder. I tried to ignore it for years and it never worked, so I finally broke. When they go low with their insults, I go lower. I hate it so much. I'm not like that in real life. I'm kind, and caring, and really sensitive. But this is real life too and I'm being an insensitive asshole. I feel like I'm betraying myself by stooping to this level. I think of my partner and my friends, and how disgusted they would be if they saw me like this. I really feel worthless.

Anyways, I'm thinking really irrationally right now. I don't know how to calm down when I'm in this house. Does anyone have any advice? Please.

&amp;#x200B;

If you care to read any more...I've been in a happy and loving and healthy relationship for a year now, but now that I'm around my family, I'm doubting myself and my relationship. It all seems fake. I'm afraid my partner hates me and is going to leave me. It's incredibly irrational. I have no reason to believe that. I know the doubts are all in my head most likely, but it feels really real and I'm terrified.",27Nov2019,1

I need to talk to someone but I'm afraid that person could only be myself 
""I don't know""
There's no ""I""
I'm getting severe panic attacks just from the sound of my mom's footsteps 
I'm staying at home for the next few days and I don't know if I can make it out alive 
This school has ruined my ability to function normally around my parents 
But I still really want to go to it because I've developed social connections that I'm truly happy with 
And of course that kid I'm crushing on, that I've actually made an effort to become friends with. I can't imagine how this school would be without him. My entire freaking world depends on his face at this point.
If I don't turn in this essay, I will not be able to return to the school after winter break. I will return to my old school. Where I was a completely different person. One that I hate. And one that I've tried so hard to throw away with this school. 
I feel nothing so much of the time and it's ready getting annoying because then you're not even human. And taking adderall was horrible because I lost the enjoyment I got from eating food. So lunch and dinners are just painful. And I don't see the worth in keeping myself alive. And I'm afraid that this is contagious. I feel validated when I see people acting depressed or alone. 

And when I try to communicate these emotions to the counselor, I go completely blank. And I forget about how I felt. And it's annoying because the only times where you feel that you actually exist are when you're existential as fuck.

35,"I have a lot of past hurts I have been nursing for about two months, overthinking, doing some soul-searching,  but mostly replaying it all, without finding anything that gets me closer to peace of mind, some of this stems from choices I made and recent events, some from choices I made farther back in the past. But I made the choices. The confusion didn't just happen to me. It's the outcome from experiences I chose, with behavior that was my own. But nobody would really know this about me, that my emotional/thought process parts of life are very complicated. My exterior is very easygoing and peaceful. I compartmentalize well.  I just think about my issues way too much. I ask myself why I seem to like things complicated, why I want to feel bad -- but I don't know.  So in the last few days, and yesterday I was asked to help my son's friend and his family, they are kids, the friend's little sister was unexpectedly very sick and hospitalized and my son's friend is a really nice kid, the family needed some easygoing care and support. I don't know the parents really well but we like and trust each other. Wow, did spending time with the kids and being asked for help put my head into an immediately better place. I am still troubled by the same things -- but they are not as significant now. The little girl is much better and is home. My son and his friend had some good times together.

39,"I'm headed home for thanksgiving. I live in a major city and am headed to the boonies via the metro. As I board - a homeless man does as well. The train is relatively full. On our way to the next stop the man begins cussing people out and overall behaving erratically. I take a seat about two rows behind him and to the right. 

He then proceeds to swing (more like swipe) at people and call them the n word. He corners one  guy who literally had his feet up at him to defend himself. By now I've resolved to do something - but fuck! My shoes are both untied.

So I tie them. And because I've resolved to do something - my adrenaline is MOVING and I tie my shoes pretty shit. Finally though - they're tied.  Tied like a blind 6 year old did it, but tied. Just as I finish a lovely woman behind me says to the bum ""NUH UH - you need to leave that man alone! He did nothing to you!""

I'm like perfect - you be the words nice lady - I'll be the heavy. And I stand up in my 5'9 glory walk up to the guy. He was taller than me and all I saw was crooked teeth when I got up to him and I was like fuck he's tall. And he smelt like ass. But I put both my hands on his arms and calmly say ""this is your stop"" and walk him out of the door. 

It was tight. 

Lady and I sat next to eachother and high fived. Another rider even said thank you! I told them it was all her - she said it was all me. when her stop came she told me to stay safe and we said goodbye to eachother

It feels like a heavy burden lifted off of both of us, and I'm glad that she didn't get mad at me or something like that, and I'm glad that we can go back to being the best friends we were for 5 years before this incident.

45,"My husband left me 2 months after marriage. He was showing signs of alcoholism a few months before we got married...I thought he was getting better and he wasn’t. After we got married he started going out a lot and with people I didn’t know. I became confident he was having an affair and when I confronted him there was a fight, he hit me, the police came. And that was the beginning of the end.

Fast forward to now (this was 18 months ago), I am in the most wonderful relationship I could ask for. I am in love with a man who loves me wholeheartedly. I have friends (I was incredibly reliant on my ex and had no social life). My family is amazing, I’m financially stable again and I have started a new job, life couldn’t be better. The problem is now I have huge abandonment issues.

Most nights my partner and I commute home together however some nights like tonight, I come straight home and he’ll go have a drink with his mates. Now firstly, I have absolutely no trust issues with this man, this is not about him and purely about me. As soon as I’m left on my own and after the gym and prepping dinner I feel incredibly alone. I hate it. I won’t eat unless my partner is home (when my husband left I basically didn’t eat for 2 months), I feel lonely and don’t know what to do with myself. I struggle just to relax and enjoy my own company.

48,"So me and my girlfriend had recently been planning on renting a place and living together, until I decided that our relationship was not quite stable enough and told her that I wanted to live on my own. This caused alot of emotions as expected, but we got through it and made up and whatnot. 

After talking, sometime later I said that I'd be willing to give living together a try. I was drunk and I thought she'd be happy to hear it, but as you can probably imagine going from one extreme to another can be confusing/ hard to adjust. She had gone through weeks of crying and trying to plan her life by herself and then I changed my mind.

This was all understandable to me but I became angry at myself for doing this to her. Also angry at myself for going back on my decision and unintentionally messing with her emotions. I got so angry that I told her I had to get something out of my truck, went outside in my underwear and punched the fender of my truck several times and fucked up my knuckles. (It's a shitbox dodge so I mean it's not super important to me but still absurd of me to do that) She noticed the blood dripping my hand and had a panic attack because and said that all the time we weren't planning to live together she wanted to cut herself (she did heavily when she was younger) and she just saw me do essentially the same thing.

I know she's right. I know this isn't normal for a person to react like that over something that warranted no such reaction, I want to figure this out. It's as if things were starting to finally work between us and then I did that and set us back further, all because I felt like a piece of shit without her ever implying that.

51,"The main goal of mine with these Cruise vacations is to travel the Caribbean exploring, taking pictures and videos, meeting the locals, we will have a top of the line Drone and at the end of the vacation, everybody will pool Footage and we will have a PRO editor make a nice informative movie that we will upload to social media so anybody can learn the ropes before going on a cruise to caribbean. We will show people the DO's &amp; Dont and places of interest. We will save many people time and money. The way I will operate is  simple and transparent. once there are 500 or 1,000 or more  members we can begin. I will have a GOFUNDME set in place and everytime the campaign goal(USD$ 5,000) is reached, then the community MUST find a way to VOTE on who will join me on this exploration to the Caribbean. I cannot SELECT who will join because its not right and will look like a scam or gambling, ALSO... EVERYBODY in the Sub will have a opportunity to be selected to join the 10 day vacation. Example; if the Sub has 2,000 members BUT 1,000 people all donate 5 dollars = 5,000 dollars and now the campaign is complete...so NOW ...all members must VOTE on who will join me on the vacation. All memebers will have a chance to be voted on, NOT just the 1,000 that donated 5 bucks. The reason this formula will be loke that is because if ONLY the 1,000 who donated 5 bucks are  
"" Allowed""  to be in the selection pool, then this can be percieved as gambling. So, NO MATTER if there are 5,000 people in the group, when 1,000 people × 5 bucks = 5,000 and now you all can vote on  ANYBODY from the 5,000 people....NOT just the 1,000 who donated.

It beats feeling responsible and guilty for making other people concerned for me simply expressing my turmoil and distress. Though many people are so conditioned and formed by their environment and its people. They don't want to be confronted by the fact that they're also in a prison. So they call me crazy.

I've never felt like I was pretty. Even though the people around me say I am pretty I'm not sure I can believe it; when I look to the people around me, I can only see the good in them. But when I see myself I only see myself as a try hard pretty girl. 

Feel like I'm just to awkward to be myself. I know I always second guess everything I do, but I use it as a self protection to avoid awkward moments. And when I do get into an awkward moment I keep it and remember it as an example to why I hate myself. I hate my personality and anything that has to do with myself.

Everything seems so uninteresting and boring. I'm just so tired of having no motivation to chase my goals. I feel like I once I had the potencial to have a good life, but somewhere on the way I lost my purpose. I'm still young but I feel like I've missed out on so much already.

76,"Last night we fought. It wasn’t suppose to be a fight at all. Neither of us thought it was even an option. 

I mean a trip that includes 5 or more countries. Something we’ve never done. Croatia, Italy, even fucking Germany all places we’ve wanted to go and more. For basically $1,000. 

Then the kicker, you’re step dad will be there. I told you that I didn’t want go. Nay, I told you that I don’t know how I would feel being around him for that long and how I don’t know if I could enjoy; and not be miserable the whole trip because he will be there. 

You argued that it didn’t matter, that you were glad that I would be upset in his presence, but how fucked up it would be of me to be miserable the whole time because of one person who has technically never done anything to me. 

I argued back that, I would try to not be miserable during the times I’m not actually around him, but that I couldn’t guarantee it. That I would try to not make it awkward for the 9 hour drive we will be on, or the week I’ll have to share a fucking hotel room with him. Because it didn’t happen to me, and all you want is for it to not to continue to affect your life. 

I argued that you could just go by yourself. But then you argued that you wouldn’t want to deal with him by yourself and how I shouldn’t even think about you going alone. So I say I’ll go. You say it’s not worth it if I’m going to be miserable. 

I say I am going to be miserable because I’m around a fucking piece of shit scum bag who deserves to rot in a ditch somewhere. You say that what happened has never been about you, that it’s always about how someone else feels about the situation, never how you feel about it. 

I argue that since you obviously don’t have a problem with it then I don’t know why you can’t go alone. You argue that you do have a problem with it if your alone, you don’t have a problem with it if I’m there. I argue that makes no sense. You argue that it’s still not about you, that I’m turning it back around to be about me. 

You cry, heavily. Saying how your mom doesn’t want to be alone with him and his family on this trip and you already got her hopes up about us going, how you don’t get to spend time with your mom because she lives out of the country and how she’s getting older, you cry more, again saying how it’s never about you and how you feel, you argue that this is a once in a lifetime trip that we now can’t experience because you told me what a dick fuck your step dad is, you cry some more arguing that because we aren’t going on this trip it’s just opening old wounds that you’ll never be able to heal because I refused to promise a non miserable trip around the world. 

We sleep. 

We wake up. You cry again saying how your entire holiday season is ruined, how you’re not going to be okay for god know how long. You cry arguing how we should be coming up with a compromise. I argue that I did. I already agreed to go with you, I already agreed that I would try to not be miserable the whole time, I literally told you the compromise last night. That is a compromise. You finally agreed. 








It doesn’t matter though. I legitimately do not want to go on this trip. But my feelings don’t matter to you. They never do. In any argument, in any “compromise” we need to make, it’s never truly a compromise. I literally just agree to whatever it is you’re accusing me of and apologize to you for it, promise to never do it again, then spend the next 3 days kissing your ass because if I even seem just a little upset it’s not okay it gets you upset all over agin. Then we have to repeat the process. 

You always tell me you want me to tell you how I feel. But I haven’t. I don’t feel like I can. And it’s fine, I grew up in an environment that you push all your feeling deep down and just be miserable for the sake of life? I don’t know. I’m saying it really sucks that I’m not allowed to have negative reactions to anything. That’s how I feel no matter how many times you tell me that it’s not true and you don’t get mad every time I get upset over something. But you do. I wish I could have a camera in the house to record it and just let you watch exactly how our fights go down and you will see literally everything go down. But it’s fine. I’ll push it away for you. 

I may not be happy, but as long as you are that’s all that matters to me.",27Nov2019,1

It kinda made me feel worthless. Like he had just thrown away the last two years and that nothing we had mattered. I told him this and he was very confused. But anyway.

they broke up after a month and that very same day he calls me saying he wasn’t me back and that he feels like he fucked up. I told him I think he’s bored and lonely and I will not be a rebound to a rebound.

But here’s the thing. After a month he still said he wanted me back. He was getting deployed, so I said we should wait till he comes home, cause I don’t wanna be asking too much from someone 4000 miles away, and idk if I could even do that. So we plan on trying again. Idk. 

I’m not crazy. I have my own friends and hobbies. And I do my own thing. Sure we lived together and worked together but I don’t think we were together constantly. I am the first person he calls when he’s sad or freaking out. I feel like I’ve been there and I have done so much for him. 

Now we are about three months into his deployment, he stopped saying he loves me and I get one word answers to texts days apart. no calls. No nothing. I said I missed him yesterday, and he said “sorry I’m not there”And I feel like somehow he’s just keeping be around so he’s not lonely... like I’m not good enough to be with or but the time in to date.

You see, the thing is, my parents they want to help me which is appreciated, but they help in such a way that you feel completely worthless as they sort out your mess.

Well, I don't want them to sort out my mess, I am thankful for the help, but I can do it on my own.And the thing is if they offer to help, they completely take over and even want to do things without me knowing them. They get no fallout for this situation, it's completely on me, my problem. And today I expressed to my mom that I am grateful for the help, but I want to take responsibility for my actions and if they want to help me, I am grateful, but I need to know what's going on.I know this sounds crazy,after all it's my issue,how can they solve it for me? And yet she started acting like we were in a fight and at one point told me ""*I have psychological issues*"" I have heard worse before, but this time I didn't take it and suck it up, I started crying and told her she offended me.She proceeded acting as if this was nothing, tried to minimize it and then tried to gaslight me. Then after five minutes (as she usually does) started acting like everything is fine which wouldn't be so bad if she didn't want me to be with her and talk.

Well this time she didn't get that. So for the first time she apologized.I didn't say nothing, not because I was being petty, I just needed time.She was trying to make amends so she wouldn't have to feel guilty.I did give in and told her I loved her,because she started crying and asking me to love her just a little bit, even though now I hated her. And I couldn't let her go to work thinking I didn't love her.I do,she's my mother,she might not be right to behave like this with me,but I am sure she has her own reasons.

Now,I am not the perfect daughter,far from it,but no one deserves to be spoken to like this.She thinks I am worthless, ambition-less and good for nothing  and today it clicked for me that nothing was going to change that. It is not my responsibility to change that, I take back my worth from her,I'll never get that validation I desperately need from her.

Sometimes it feels like she wants me to stay a fuck up in her mind,because she enjoys beating me down. Shouldn't she be glad I am solving my issues myself,taking control of my life? This issue doesn't affect them in the slightest, but she gone and berated me again,like I did something horrible and for the first time I didn't care for it.

A lot of stuff is happening in my life and it appears some have hit yield signs, stop signs or even dead end. However I can't tell which stopped where. 

I'm a church goer who's been praying for these topics.

1. I've been working my job 5 years and January they pushed for me to take a certification test. I study for the test and in March I make a 46 (70 is passing). Disappointed yet i study again and they put me through a class to take it again. Take the test in September and make a 51. All this studying has a co-worker want to take the test. We test together (Monday) and I make a 53 he does a 57. I don't want to study for this anymore. I want nothing to do with it, I don't want the promotion or the money, but I dont want my co-worker to study alone.

2. I'm a writer. I've been writing for 10 years now and through that time I've felt uneasy about what I write. Its a gritty crime story about a dissolving friend group. The story features sexist characters, a prejudice, prostitutes, murder, a few hundred swear words and a dozen or so GDs sprinkled here and there. After 10 years I've put into this project (1/3 of my life) I've almost got it complete,  I even git a cover. Where suddenly I ask myself: ""Where is God in this?"" I take a a step back and I don't see him anywhere. All I see is my therapy session of how I dealt with a disolving friendship. Now my PASSION has turned into something taboo. My THERAPY is taboo.

84,"Nail biting is something I've been doing since I was maybe 4 years old (I'm 25 atm). My nails look awful and whenever someone makes a joke or a post saying, ""If your nails look like this \[insert picture of some really messed up nails and finger skin bleeding and malformed here\] don't even look at me"" I would instantly look at my nails and fingertips and ball it up to conceal them . I've had moments where I let my nails grow and I say, ""I'm not gonna bite them anymore"" but I always relapse after a while. The urge is almost subconscious and I don't even notice I relapse and when I do I get hit with the mentality of, ""I already failed. Might as well go all the way"" but the instant satisfaction never outweighs the shame of failure and the unhealthy coping mechanism I have with anxiety and stress by biting my nails.

94,"Tl;dr - Just telling my story. Im a recent college grad, been unable to find work, strained relationship with mother, no car, no friends. 

Reddit, this is gonna be a long story. 

After I graduated college in May I moved back home with my mother and 2 younger brothers. Where I have no car. 

I was sure I was gonna get a job at the company my mom works for. Not through nepotism or anything like that, but they were seeking recent grads for a position that paid fairly well. I met all of their criteria and was sure I’d get the job. Hell, when people asked what I was gonna do after college that was my answer. 

Originally, the plan was to start working there to secure a higher salary, move across the country with my mom, and then transfer to the branch there. I was on board at first. I loved where I currently live but wasn’t as attached to it anymore since I have no close friends in the area. 

It sounded amazing when I was still in college and it was all just talk. But, things have not gone according to plan. I got invited for an interview but didn’t pass this computer test they make you take. So I didn’t get the job. 

I thought there was no point in applying for anymore jobs in my area since I wasn’t gonna be living there much longer. So I instead devoted much of my time to studying for the MCAT. The plan was to start up the job search again when I moved to the new place by the end of the summer. 

But we weren’t moved by then. My mom’s job was taking a really long time with her transfer. And my relationship with her was not in a good place. 

Ever since I graduated from college, our relationship dynamic went from best friends to tense/hostile/awkward. She didn’t respect my boundaries. In conversation she’d argue with everything I said, shut me down, cut me off or act snarky. I had to tiptoe around her and walk on eggshells because she seemed to be offended by everything I said. She made homophobic comments to me knowing I’m bi. She just always had a negative attitude. 

I tried talking to her about some of these things and it went nowhere. Once she even lashed out at me for telling her she hurt my feelings. It made me uncomfortable to the point where I’d barely speak to her beyond hi/bye. 

Every time we interacted, you could but the tension with a knife. It was made worse that I had no way to get around on my own. And it made me want to just stay here and find an apartment on my own. 

So I started my job search again in late summer/early fall. Nothing. Most likely we’ll be out of here by sometime January. And I’m sad about it. I’ve also lost motivation to study for the MCAT. 

My mother is saying that it’ll take a few months before she’s able to get me a car. That’s not her fault of course. But I need to find a way to get one fast because I can’t with not being able to be independent. 

And if I were able to stay here, that would eliminate the need for a car. But I’m not even sure if I should try anymore because I don’t know how long it’ll take to me to save up for an apartment. And rent here is not cheap. 

The crux of the matter is I feel I’ve put my life on hold. I stay off social media partly because I don’t like seeing how the people I knew in college have moved on with their lives, when I feel I haven’t. And it hurts to see other people getting the things I want but don’t yet have. 

And sometimes (I know I shouldn’t think like this) but I get worried about how my younger brothers see me. Having no car or friends, and very little money, I stay at home most of the time. And I don’t want them to look at me and think, “I don’t want to be like her when I get to her age.” 

And I feel like, with tiptoeing around my mom and having to move somewhere I don’t want to go, I’ve just had to compromise too much recently. And I don’t want to compromise anymore.

I used to only feel sad and sorry for myself and pathetic, but now I've been particularly interested in murder, and most of all watching the world burn and crumble. I felt like I needed to see some sort of justice take place.

A few hours ago, I had a panic attack because I saw something incredibly disturbing in person that combined my three worst fears. Organized holes (ie, shape of a grid,) blood, and soft points on the body. (Ie wrist, neck.) I couldn't breath for a solid half hour and cried for 15 minutes. Even now I am on edge.  But now I have this strange urge to go back and take a picture off it and torture myself with this picture over and over again, to go back to starving myself, to cutting myself, overdosing on drugs, tossing myself off a rooftop - I don't fucking care. I just need to hurt myself. I really feel like I need to die right now.",27Nov2019,1
108,i grew up in a muslim family. i was very narrow minded growing up. i thought it was the right thing to do to be a muslim. never thought it was mostly just the geography that affected my belief. if i was born somewhere else i most likely wouldve ended up believing in jesus or buddha. in high school it hit me. i thought all around it and decided i was an agnostic. now im 20 years old. and i am unspeakably afraid of death. i dont know what to do. i often even have a hard time sleeping at night. what do i do?,27Nov2019,1
109,"I spend them alone in my apartment in Philly. I never have interest in doing anything. I cant even remember what I did last Christmas. 

But this year I randomly got excited for Thanksgiving. I prepped all sorts of food so it’s ready to cook tomorrow and Im dying to eat a real meal instead of the frozen shit Ive been eating. I even got my cat turkey flavored wet food for her “fancy” Thanksgiving meal haha. 

Ive been in such a funk lately, and Ive been avoiding my family for months. I wont be going home for Christmas either but Thanksgiving will be dope for the first time in years and Im stoked.",27Nov2019,1
