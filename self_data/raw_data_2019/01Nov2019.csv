0,"Halloween isn't even so bad, no traditional gatherings or anything you don't want to do. No one came to my door tonight so it was easy to ignore. Imagining the lives and parties people must be having. Plenty of people hooking up with one or multiple people tonight. It's easy, apparently. Sigh. 

Thanksgiving and Christmas are the worst. But I'm glad others can find some fun and spice to life in the specially designated days. 

Life always sucks, holidays set the expectation somewhat otherwise. Obviously that doesn't happen, so the empty days and nights somehow feel emptier.",01Nov2019,9
1,"I have seen no decorations this year at all in my town or anywhere around me. It’s as though the holiday just never even existed In the first place.

Like usually kids are all dressed up and houses are spooky looking, but this year it’s different. At  my school I saw very few people dress up including the younger children. The teachers didn’t even have any sort of Halloween thing planned for the class like usual.

It’s 8:27 and I have had 0 trick or treaters at my door. I looked outside and there is legit nobody

Maybe I'm wrong and there are exceptions. Who knows... I feel like a pedo because of looking teens with sexual desire, I know it's normal but just wondering if it's normal... BTW, I'm 27yo.

5,"I keep telling myself that no one would care if I was gone. I have people who I know love and care about me, so how do I keep making myself believe that that's not true? Maybe it would just be best if I left. I can feel myself pulling away from everybody. It's becoming very lonely, not that that's anything new, I'm always lonely, though i'm never alone. I've actually kind of tried talking to someone about everything, but he said what everybody says, ""things do get better"". No, I know that they got better for you, I know that they got better for a lot of people, and i'm glad about that. But that doesn't mean that they are going to get better for me.

I'm not a good person, i've tried to fix it, fix myself, but i'm not sure that I can be fixed. Everyone tries to tell me and make me believe that i'm good, but why? why can't they see how broken I am? or do they see it and they're just ignoring it? Why do I feel this way? why am I crying right now? why do I want my story to end?

I'm writing this here right now cause I need to say it somewhere. I don't know if anyone will read it, I wouldn't blame them if they didn't. I just need to let this out so it doesn't push me off the edge.

I'm sorry for the things that i've said and done. I wish things were different. I know that i'll go to Hell on the day that I die, and that's my own fault, I drug that grave and when I finally lay in it i'll be the only one there is to blame. I do wonder how people will remember me after I die though, will they keep thinking that I was the happy little girl who always kept her chin up? or will they realize that that was a mask? Will they miss me? or just forget?

Only time can answer these questions, and even then I won't know for I won't be there to see it, to see them. Tomorrow i'm going to try to talk to my friend about this.

And to anyone reading this, if there is anyone reading this. Don't let yourself get as broken as I have. Talk to someone, do \*something\*. Cause once it gets this deep it can't truly be fixed.",01Nov2019,2
6,"I got asked if I would risk my life to save someone else’s recently and I answered yes very quickly, which makes me sound better than I am.

7,"So, i have always been fascinated with this topic, as i am sure most of you are. I have heard stories here and there from acquaintances over the years but never actually encountered one myself. There’s something about the belief of other species in the universe that is reassuring. Maybe “they” hold the keys to all human philosophical questions that we have about life, right? I mean, they would have too if they were more advanced than us. 

Anyways, i am wondering if anyone has had an encounter or knows someone who has. Please share your story.",01Nov2019,2
8,"So basically was just texting with this girl, she mentioned that she needs to get to this mall to buy this and that, I asked if she wants some company while doing that and she pretty happily agreed.

So we just met up, wandered around this mall for like an hour talking about random shit, then ended up going to see some shitty horror movie (the mall has a cinema inside). It was bad so we just kinda poked fun at it and laughed the whole time. Then went outside, walked and talked for like another half an hour until we had to split because it was getting late.

Probably doesn't sound like anything too special for the average person and she probably didn't think too much of the whole interaction but as someone who hasn't had friends for years now this meant a ton to me. She has no idea how happy this whole interaction made me. I really hope we get to hang out more sometime soon.

Not sure if there's much point to this story, just wanted to share how happy I'm feeling right now. This is the type of shit that makes me wish I had a consistent good friend group or a girlfriend, idk.",01Nov2019,4
9,"I find very specific types of ASMR soothing, mostly scratching and brushing sounds. These aren't hard to find, but what bothers me is the huge percentage of videos that are just *mouth sounds*.

Apparently I'm in the minority of people that is actively pissed off by any kind of smacking, slurping, tongue clicking, or whatever the hell else these videos have in them. I don't really know because I stay far away from them. Do normal people actually enjoy that? It's fucking weird and gross and the direct opposite of relaxing for me. I don't understand.

I don't care so much if they stay in their own respective videos, but for fucks sake do NOT just randomly start making smacking or licking noises in a completely unrelated video without putting it somewhere in the title or description. You are an asshole if you do that.",01Nov2019,21
10,"Every day, there's a pain in my heart and it won't go away and now I know i'm falling in deep because I need someone here with me.

I'm working hard every day, I wake up and I force myself to do an hour workout of weights. On the weekends I jog with my dog for cardio. I completely stopped smoking nicotine and weed and never take any drugs except microdosing to improve my health. I socialize with anyone who wants to at work - i'm a cashier - some of them are cute and flirt, I love them, but this isn't enough. I go on tinder and I see who I can match and start a conversation with, who wants to go on a date? I've already fucked a romanian girl it was amazing.

Can I tell you something just between you and me?

I'm fucking crumbling.

I'm not sure how much longer I can give it my all and not get what I want.

Sex is not what I want.

I'm fucking lonely and it's suicidal.

In my spare time if i'm not working on my body or eating i'm healing in world of warcraft and I try my very fcuking best to make sure anyone on my team is having a good time. I look after my dog and I look after any woman and child on this planet. Those are important to me.

But i'm crumbling.

There's a big difference between being suicidal and just being depressed because you felt it's edgy or cool. I don't think i'm gonna make it. All this work is for nothing. I'll keep pushing everyday but my suicide is not planned, it'll just be an impulse one day when i've had one too many beers on the weekend.

All I wanted was someone to share this magnificent life with, because life is magnificent, but i'm expericing just a fraction, just a portion of it.

13,"The title is the TL;DR.

***I draw and write.*** I have so many creative projects and stories. I want to publish them, my characters, etc. and I used to do that. I even posted two drawings on Reddit, but they, like my motivation, have been buried. I am trying to figure out how to start again and even start doing commissions, but fear and low self-esteem have my wrists and mind chained. Every time I go to do something, my head is fogged and I am suddenly too tired to work. And when I do manage to finish something, I start believing everyone on Earth HATES me and my works to the point of others telling people to avoid me. And when I do share it in my social circle (one other person) they act uninterested and ignore me, only to talk to someone else or talk about themselves.

***This is relevant:*** *Unfortunately, I endured countless tragedies.* Several deaths, including losing my grandmother and a cousin's murder, abuse and abandonment by my father *and* ex-stepfather *(longer story)* and having to care for family members with serious physical and mental health complications -- struck hard and I developed burnout and severe depression. I am afraid to go to counseling because every counselor I have visited was either angry, pregnant *(really!)* or trying to get me to take medication. I've had a counselor throw a book at me, all because I wanted to talk to her. *(Middle finger to Mrs. E -- my middle school years were HELL because of you!)*

***How do I fix this?*** I know my depression may be a factor, but I feel there's something fundamentally wrong. Like I have ASD or I'm just mentally unfit or just too stupid to write/draw/do anything. (Rumors around high school painted me as special needs and they stuck until I left).

I can't live this way and I'm starting to hear myself say, *""If I died tomorrow, everyone will celebrate.""*",01Nov2019,2

I was both surprised and saddened by the inordinate amount of kids who didn't have costumes, but it didn't have a negative impact on my thoughts. What did bother me - and something I found more annoying after the fact - was how many of them didn't say ""trick-or-treat,"" or anything for that matter. They'd just come up, open their pillowcase/candy receptacle, and wait. We'd drop the candy, and they'd leave without saying ""thank you,"" or freakin' something. Anything.

26,"W
Ok so long story short, I have a long distance boyfriend of two years, and in the past month he had completely changed and started acting in a very concerning manner. A few days after I went home after seeing him for a few weeks, he started acting extremely hostile and just plain mean. He would call me terrible things, ignore me for hours at a time, and then just laugh in my face and say he never did that and that I have no proof. 
He also developed an unhealthy relationship with partying. He did come extremely close to developing a drug problem before, so this worried me. 
He would say that he needed to go to all these parties, nothing would stop him, and that he would party and do drugs until the next day. 
Clearly you can see how this behavior (which went on for about 3-4 weeks) raised some concerns. 
I was on the brink of breaking up with him, but he really did not want to listen to me when I would mention it, he would just say that we’re staying together forever and then shut off completely. I was worried that if I did leave him, he would really do something stupid and hurt himself. 

So I decided to tell one of his friends what was going on. I wrote out a very long and detailed message explaining his recent behavior, and why I thought it could potentially be dangerous. In the message I specified that I do not expect an answer, I just want to “clear my conscience” by letting someone know what’s been going on, in case anything happens to him. 
I sent it to one of his close female friends, because she was hanging out with him a lot, and seemed to be rational. 
She read the message and immediately asked to talk on the phone, saying she was so concerned. We talked and she said that she believes me, but will not talk to him about it, because she doesn’t want him to get mad at her (she said he was being super nice to her recently and she doesn’t want to lose that). She then offered (out of nowhere) to give him “alternate attractions” to all the rave parties (which are the places where he would usually do drugs) he was planning on going to. She said he’s been way too into planning them out, and she hates those types of parties, so she can just invite him to bars instead whenever he plans on going to these things. 

The next weekend rolls around, and she makes him ditch his friends to go to a rave with her and do 3 different types of drugs together. 

Is it just me or is this behavior a little messed up? 
I didn’t ask her to do anything, she was the one to offer, and then did the exact opposite. During our phone conversation, I asked multiple times if she thinks I’m overthinking this, and I asked her to be honest, because I was stressed. She said no, and said she was worried too. 

I just want someone’s honest opinion on this situation, and especially the girls behavior. 
I’ve been getting mixed opinions from friends and would just like to know what a stranger thinks. Did I just put her in an uncomfortable situation? Is that an excuse for what she did? 
I don’t know 

He had since calmed down and is back to his normal self, but the issue of the friend still concerns me. 

TL;DR My long distance boyfriend had been acting in a concerning way, I decided to let his friend know about it (since she lives close to him and could act if needed), she said she was very worried and made some promises which she immediately broke. Not sure how to feel about her behavior.",01Nov2019,2

I felt super weird about  it and was minding my own business but all of a sudden he offered me to  help me masturbate. I have never been gay and have never had any kind of  feelings towards men. I denied it in the beginning but he did not leave  and few seconds later he again requested and I allowed. We went into  the bathroom of that urinal and he closed the door. I was really scared  but he said it is totally fine and I don't have to worry. He started  masturbating me and at the same time he started removing his jeans and i  actually felt really good while he masturbated which at the same time  was weird for me as I have never been with a guy. He took my penis into  his mouth which came to me as surprise and i tried to push him away but  he held on to me and started giving me blowjob. I had never felt so good  even my wife does it. I ejaculated in his mouth and i felt super guilty  about what I did. He thanked me and asked me if he wanted to have sex  after few minutes and for a shock for myself I did not say an yes or no.  He gave me a cigarette and we started smoking and I asked him just to  be sure that he doesn't have any STD because i had no condoms and I was a  bit scared of this. He said he is clean and just asked me not to cum  inside him. After that he removed my clothes and one thing led to  another and I penetrated an ass for the first time. I have never had  anal sex with my wife as she doesn't like it. I  was really enjoying  having sex with he kept saying when I was about to climax ""pull it out""  but in that excitement even when he tried to push me away  I pulled him  closer and ejaculated inside him. He got a bit pissed but he gave a kiss  to my penis and said it is fine. He gave me his number in case I would  like to meet him again. Its been 2 weeks since then .

And the worst part is that I feel like I could have that lifestyle if I where to live on campus, rather than commute.  Idk why but it just irks me so much and it pushes me to want to workout harder and harder, and usually I’d go for a run when I feel like this, but now I can’t bc I’m injured and it sucks.

I even deleted the girls whose story was of them partying bc I just couldn’t stand it and it bothers me so much for some reason. There’s a part of me who realizes that the only reason why I want to go out like this is for the societal expectations and validation, but it’s like I can’t help but just feel defeated when it seems like  everybody else has something that I don’t. I don’t have a dorm, or friends who I can go out like that with, and I don’t know why I needed to just get this off my chest.

I still live at home, in my parents' native country it's okay to still live at home at 22 but I grew up in the states so I know the culture here is to move out at 18 or at least with a couple of years after that but I haven't yet and I don't think I will any time soon since I used up all of my saving buying a car for my parents. And as I alluded to earlier, I'm in therapy due to depression, anxiety, loneliness and hopelessness.

So basically I still live at home. I'm broken inside to the point of needing therapy. Work at an unreliable job. Barely have any saving. And I'm still not even half way done with school despite attending classes for 4 years already (changed my major and did part time schooling for a while)

So today someone informed me that my ex just started a new relationship and it just struck me in a way I didnt expect.

Then I got your text LOLOLL cmon. Why did I even respond. I should hate you! But I don’t.

I want to let you go. But I’m afraid. 

I want to keep you.  But I’m still afraid. 

What’s hilarious is I’ve always encouraged myself to face problems head on. Now I never thought i would stumble and fall over a you. 

I never thought I could be so bad at everything Bc I was anxious. All the success I’ve created is meaningless Bc I feel like it’s fake and now this is the true me.

He's in the comm department here (I think) and I'm taking comm classes for my major requirments. But I don't run into any other comm people nearly as much as I run into this guy.

I talked to my mom and a friend about this. And they've been telling to chese him down lol.

54,"Hello everyone. 

Last year, I (20F) was worrying about if I liked a guy from my class or not. I'd never liked anyone and in high school I didn't make any male friends, so when I arrived at uni I met some cool guys, who treated me right and were very friendly. In my uni's group of friends there was a guy and he and I became a little closer last year. I didn't understand my feelings, sometimes I've would be thinking: is this how a crush feels like??? or is it just the fact that he is my first male friend in a long time??

I think if someone have told me all the things I thought about him and the things I noticed about him, I would have say to that person  hat he/she liked that someone.

Summer arrived and now that we have returned to classes and I've been seeing him again for a month, I know that I don't like him, but I kinda miss that feeling, you know?? It was like exciting to go to classes and hanging out with him and paying attention to details like the way he looked at me or how he laughed at my jokes, now everything feels normal, which it's great you know, but I guess it's because I wanna fall in love but it doesn't seem to happen.",01Nov2019,2
55,"My mental illness has put me in crisis for so long. I have ruined every relationship. I have no ground to stand on. Nowhere to go. 
My siblings are unable to help. They have moved on from our terrible childhoods and finally started thriving. They are unable to understand me, and my mental illness. 
My mother is sick of me. She has dealt with my shit for all of my teen years, and have told everyone else about what a piece of shit I’ve been. She is done raising kids
My father I am absolutely terrified by. He cannot understand my mental illness because of his own. He has heard horror stories from my mom. 
My friends have all left me because they are tired of exerting energy on someone that doesnt help themselves. 

So heres my problem: I have had everybody try, for so long, trying to get me to a better place. Everybody tries for me, and I never learn how to try myself. 

My suicidal behavior, my self harm, my crying and late night texts, my drug binges, my ghosting, my “not being okay”, has been going on for so long that everybody has learned that it is best for them to walk away. 
It makes perfect sense, and Im glad they care enough about themselves to do so. 
If I never show progress, why try so hard for me? 
If I never care about myself, why should they? 

I never asked for anyone to sit with me crisis after crisis, but I guess who wouldnt try and support a struggling young girl? Ive gone to so many mental hospitals, it seems like I should know how to be better by now. Like I should know how to help myself. 
Why am I always in crisis? 
Why are other people always putting out fires for me? 
I want to say that Ive tried, that I am trying. 
But the truth is, I dont know how to try, I dont know what trying is, I dont know why I should try, I dont know what better looks like, I dont know how to not bring everyone down around me. 
I feel like I am constantly making excuses for myself, so Ive tried to stop that. 
Every way I have seen fit, Ive tried, and the ways others have recommended too. 
I want to be okay. 
I dont know what okay is. 
I dont have any stable job employment history, I dont currently have a job. I have been jumping from place to place, exhausting people, and havent had my own bedroom since i was 18. I didnt go to school because I was always in crisis, or laying around literally doing nothing.  I am not in college, and I have no prospectives on my future. 
I have a kind generous boyfriend, that I am tiring out as well. He now veiws me drastically different than when we met. Because I am always in crisis. 
I have nowhere to go after I leave the house we are both crashing. 

I dont know how to be okay. 
I need to know how to be okay and how to change my life. 
I know its not that easy. 

I have schizoaffective disorder - bipolar subtype. 

I think I have to check myself into the hospital in the morning to get away from my boyfriend. 
I am bringing his life down, and he is unable to break away from me. 
I need to learn how to live. 
I dont know if the hospital can help. 
I am looking for any answers on how I can change. 
How I can be better. How I can not lose my boyfriend as well.

56,"Got in a fight with my fiancé Halloween morning because it’s my favorite holiday and we had no plans. Because we live in the middle of nowhere and have no friends. And since he would be tired getting home from work he didn’t want to dress up and go walk around. He says he’s tired of being the 30-year-old couple that dresses up and walks around with no kids.

I took down all the Halloween decorations after he left for work. I’m tired of being the 30-year-old couple with no kids on Halloween too. We’ve been trying to have a baby for 4 years, no luck. 3 years ago we got pregnant and I miscarried. I’ve had health problems ever since. At this point I’m not sure if I can have kids.

Three days ago I’m at my OBGYN, getting labs done for progesterone tests to see if I’m even cycling correctly. My mother calls me to fawn about my cousin’s new baby, my other cousin’s gender reveal, and how cute their 2 year old is. The 2 year old who would have been 2 weeks apart from the baby I lost.

Thanks, Mom. I know it’s not malicious. She loves family and expects me to be excited for them. But it’s just more salt in the wounds. I can’t talk to her about my fears of infertility; she just tells me not to worry about it. I’ve tried to explain to her that it literally invades my dreams. I dream constantly about babies or other people’s babies. Even in sleep I get no relief, no rest.

October 3rd was our 9th anniversary. My fiancé and I actually make plans to go out to our favorite sushi place. 30 minutes into dinner I need to go home. I’m nauseous, I’m having hot and cold sweats, I’m stuffed up like I have allergies and can hardly swallow. It’s happened to me ever since I miscarried, no doctor has really been able to figure it out. We leave the restaurant and I puke my dinner out on the front lawn as soon as I get home.

My fiancé is trying so hard to keep it together and stay strong. But he didn’t sign up for this. Neither of us did. I was healthy when we met. I was strong. I was independent. I was motivated. Now I can’t work, I might not even be able to have kids, I get sick all the time and I generally have no motivation, no hope, no joy anymore.

This is the first year I didn’t dress up as anything. At least last year we put on costumes and had fun by ourselves. This year we just sat on the couch, smoked weed, and he fell asleep watching the Twilight Zone. I couldn’t stop thinking about being barren and growing old and alone and how my Halloween was so boring and sad, so I took a Xanax and just crawled into bed and waited until the numbness took over and I drifted to sleep.

Basically the same as most any other day of the week. I don’t blame my fiancé for anything, he’s exhausted. He works all week because I can’t. He is constantly worried about my mental health, my physical health. He has no family here. We left everything we had to move here to start a family of our own in what we thought would be a better place. We left good jobs, a busy city with all our friends and lots of things to do. He sacrificed so much for this. Now I’m not sure if we can even have kids. So what is this all for?

We are supposed to get married next year October... I find myself hardly able to look forward to that. I love my fiancé so much but I almost would rather just leave him so he doesn’t have to be stuck with me anymore. I don’t know why he loves me like he does. Sometimes I wish we never met, because I feel like I’ve ruined his life. He could be with literally any other woman. I don’t want to lose him, either. I don’t want to push him away with my anxiety and my depression.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I am so lost. Someone please talk to me.",01Nov2019,6

58,"It's been around 9 months since I separated from the girl who I've spent most of my life with, I kinda ""met"" her when I was 16 and got a crush on her ever since. At 18 years of age we truly meet and instantly fell in love, we moved to other countries together, traveled, got married at 19...

It was a relationship straight out of a movie, I attended her prom, highschool sweethearts, had our nice shitty car, our nice broke ass joint bank account, she was gonna study to be a nurse, I was going to be a cop, we even were planning to have kids when we had both graduated and have secured our jobs... We were gonna move to Maine and live in a small town, it was all gonna be great.

And her... She was so smart, funny, nerdy, we played videogames together and on top of that she was this beautiful redheaded girl, full with freckles and some gorgeous blueish/grayish eyes, she was tall, even taller than me, she was a fucking model lookalike WAYS out of my league (I'm average or a bit above average I guess), yet she loved me as deeply as I did love her.

But all that is gone now, she's gone, I made a big mistake (no I didn't cheat,) we fought hard, it really got out hand bad and it just... Ended.

She went back to Canada, to study medicine, she's doing fine I guess, even talking to a guy as far as I know and she told me last time we spoke some 3 months ago. Me? I'm in Argentina, sure I have a good job and a nice job but I'm just... Unhappy. I don't blame her, I've had hookups and talked to some girls too to see if the pain would go away but that didn't really work out and it left me feeling even sadder and emptier. So I don't really blame her or hate her for talking to a guy after it all ended, I did mostly the same.

But man am I jaded, want to take my life, have tried but failed, ended up in the hospital. I can't find anyone attractive at all, and I feel like shit because this girl got into me and I just couldn't reciprocate and used her only for sex. Now I'm abstaining from hook-ups and talking to people, even then, I've also isolated myself because I just don't have the energy or will to do anything anymore. Just work to survive and eat and a have a roof. That's it, don't have friends, don't have anything anymore. I can't bring myself to do anything more than working.

I'm unhappy, severely utterly and completely unhappy, very miserable and like the joker said and I quote ""All I have are negative thoughts"" (Really good movie btw, and no I won't shoot anything up, of anything just myself)

Anyone got a suggestion that doesn't end with me killing myself? Because I honestly can't see a future anymore, can't see loving or being loved again, can't see myself even liking someone after how beautiful and perfect she was, can't see anything.

That's all, I guess I just wanted to vent.",01Nov2019,0

As we all know, tonight was Halloween. Happy Halloween! I went out with my girlfriend and two other friends to trick or treat. I’m 16. We had a lot of fun, and got a significant amount of candy. During our trek throughout the hallowing neighborhood of Ghosts and ghouls, I saw an elderly couple in costumes. They went up to the house, but the owner was “out of candy” they told our group. My friends went up to the house anyway, and it turned out that the owner had just a few more pieces left, and she gave them to us. When leaving the yard, I ran up to the elderly couple and gave them each a couple pieces of candy. I will absolutely never forget this. They smiled some of the most genuine, happy smiles I have seen in my short life. It made me feel so good, to do such a small act. 

Happy Halloween everyone, and give treats, no matter the age of the trickster. Stay safe!m",01Nov2019,3

The start date happened to be exactly two weeks away so I let all of my higher-ups at my security office and job site know that I’m putting in my two weeks. In a sense I felt like I could’ve done more in the last three years, but I won’t dwell on it since I’m still 23. Especially since  that even though I’ve made little money (never cared much for money anyway), I’ve grown more in that time than I ever did throughout my younger school years. The new job is seasonal so it’s just a reminder that I’ll need to bust my ass. I’m not worried though because I’m almost halfway through my Bachelors in Computer Science so I can see my future. It helps me a lot to feel as though I have direction. I don’t expect it to be easy, but any good that manifests itself thereafter is just a bonus. 

I saw a quote earlier that had to do with chasing pleasure leading to solely shame after the pleasure ends vs. putting in hard work and only good being left over once the hard work is done.

As far as the job goes I could’ve just given up since I went in a month ago without the right documents and had to get my birth certificate from a different state. I just coasted for most of the month while deciding I needed the birth certificate anyway. As soon as I had it in my hands it gave me the momentum I needed to continue looking and even though my original job location was out of available positions I ended up finding a way better offer. There may be a little but of luck involved, but obviously every single possible chance will be missed without casting the net.

Another reason why this feels so good is because of all of the possible job opportunities I went for in the last couple of years with responses saying that I’m not what they’re looking for right now.",01Nov2019,1

70,"(34 M) 9 years 7 months ago, I was rushed into hospital after suffering from chronic headaches for months on end. (just the tip of the iceburg) 

I was diagnosed with Hydrocephalus, so I have a Ventriculoperitoneal shunt fitted. I was always slow to learn during my formative years, so imagine I've had the condition since birth, but without the characteristic enlarged cranium.

I've always felt that there was something not quite right, as though I was someone else with a personality that wasn't truly mine.
Always felt off somehow, like I didn't fit in anywhere.

Once I had the surgery, all the locks on the doors in my mind, were blown off. Everything I had learned was just there, queued up &amp; ready for the taking. I couldn't remember anything from my past, as it was traumatic, as I think my brain just flushed it out.

Waking up, in a slightly disorientated state, I looked like something out of the Matrix, with a shaved head, tubes sticking out from everywhere. As well the inevitable tube that was plugged into the side of my brain. 

I remember having a very sore throat, I asked why is my throat sore? I was half hoping to have morphus to appear &amp; say ""because you've never used it before, Welcome to the world of the real"" - but that only happens in the movies.. 

Dr Andrew Martin, came over &amp; asked how I was feeling I said, 
""Brainwashed &amp; Conditioned"" He just laughed &amp; said, ahh its good to see you have a sense of humour. 

For the first time in my life, I felt like my actual age, almost as if I'd matured overnight. I felt at peace, my head felt so quiet &amp; surrene, like being on a beach at midnight, with the waves lashing up on to the shore. 

Everything looked brighter, sounds were clearer, everything was just like something from a dream. 

I felt content, &amp; happy for the first time in my life, I don't know if it was the euphoria of coming out the otherside of a life threatening situation or what, but I just blissfully at peace. True mental freedom. 

Over the coming months, I wanted to see what this new guy could do, I'd look in the mirror &amp; not recognise myself. I had to learn to walk again, I felt as though, I needed to keep moving my tounge around, not sure why. 

I was experiencing life for the first time, as the real me, not this facade that had been poorly  emulating my life up until now. 

I would talk to everyone and anyone, I even got a short term job as a result, due to being able to memorise my card back wards &amp; forwards on both sides. 

I had been on a forum for people interested in consoles, never really posted anything at all, before the surgery. After which I was posting a lot of tutorials based on how to manipulate various systems. None of which I had any prior knowledge of doing. 

Also managed to learn Lilium from Elfen Lied in the space of a few hours, as opposed to the weeks it took my then girlfriend to learn. I would later learn that I was an expectant father to be, but it was not meant to happen, as the pregancy was ectopic, plus we were in not state to have a child. 

I still think about what could of been though. My time will come, I'm sure with the right person at the right time. 

I have a far greater appreciation for life, &amp; not bound by what I do or do not have, well not as much. Sure, I'd love to learn to drive, but I guess that will come, when it's supposed to.

My top list of reducing stress:

1) Float tank session. Have you ever tried it? It's a camera of sensory deprivation. Scientists have already proved the results of depression and anxiety.

2)  Digital Coach. A guy posted some time ago about the app PocketCoach. And I've seen real results. I like that I can find tips for my current feelings. Here is [the link to test it](https://www.iamfeelinganxious.com/?utm_source=red&amp;utm_medium=0111).

76,"######Backstory

I (20M senior college student) used to live abroad when I was very young but eventually returned to my home country 7 years ago. In the 7 years that I've lived here, I've never hung out with someone outside of school or college. Every Friday, people would go to parties and hang out with their friends after school. Me? i'd go straight home, lie on my bed and browse reddit, binge youtube, or play games on my laptop till i'd fall asleep. I've been through the exact same routine for 7 years. I've never hung out with someone outside of school or college. I've never made any friends. These 7 years are just a blur. I can't remember anything special when I look back at them.

######Problems

-I cant speak my own language (arabic) properly. I read, write, and speak at a 6th-grade level, which is embarrassing. This, as a result, makes me suck at social interactions and hence I avoid them or else I'll be ridiculed and people will think I'm retarded for not being able to speak like an adult.

-I'm ugly. I got a 4/10 on the r/amiugly sub (note that this is a sub where people sugarcoat ratings to make you feel better). My unattractiveness has fueled my social anxiety.

-I have an awful case of social anxiety. My forehead drips in very visible sweat when I get nervous in social situations. The visible sweat is what prevents me to go up and talk to someone. At least if i wasn't sweating, i could hide my social anxiety. but the sweat is visible, anyone can see it. hence why i avoid any social interactions..

-Me avoiding social interactions and being ugly has made me socially inept. I struggle to hold basic conversations and I can't naturally speak and reply to questions like I can online. You'd get the impression that I'm borderline autistic just talking to me irl (but i'm not). 

######My current thoughts

-I’m pretty sure if I lived in an English-speaking country I would be much more confident. But you might wonder why not just learn arabic? Well, I hate living in my country, which is very backwards and poorly developed. I want to get out of this place asap and that is why I’ve been attempting to self-learn programming (frontend web development) while I’m in uni studying MIS. I’d rather spend my time learning that then learning arabic. Realistically I don’t have the time to do both.

-I still have one year of college left, I then have one year of military conscription (this is going to be torture since I don’t know arabic), and then at least 1.5 more years to get a job that’ll give me the experience points I’d need for immigration. 

-So 3.5 years left to keep living in this torture — being depressed, thinking about death, hating my life, hating that I have no friends, hating that I can’t talk to women. I don’t think I can do it. Idk why I’m supposed to suffer like this, I’ve always been a polite, quiet kid who kept to himself.

-I need help, I need advice, I need someone to talk to.",01Nov2019,3

79,"I've always been troubled with how my friends would feel uncomfortable or tense whenever i joke about my looks. I'm a not so good looking pal and honestly, i've accepted that fact already and i just want the people close to me to also realize that. I just want to joke about it and make a little fun of myself but whenever i do, they get all uncomfortable and dont know how to react. IM OKAY, GUYS. I'VE ACCEPTED IT ALREADY, OKAY? You are simply making me feel bad about it when you act like that. It seems like you think i'm so ugly that you pity me so much, you can't even joke about it. I just want to finally be completely comfortable about it and fully accept myself as i am.",01Nov2019,0
80,"Guess I’m doing a lot of introspection today, if you see my post history, but anyway. 

What I mean is when I feel like I’ve hurt someone or I’ve made them mad, I wish they would hurt me physically so I can feel like it’s “even.” For some reason I believe that if they could just hurt me then I won’t have any guilt over what I did wrong. And sometimes when I feel bad over nothing, like if I’m depressed or something, I just want someone, anyone to punch me in the face or something. Like I imagine it’ll feel like some kind of relief??

My boyfriend is so sweet and amazing and whenever I’ve done something wrong he just tells me calmly and I apologize and he accepts it and moves on completely. I don’t deserve him at all. I have such a hard time coming to terms with the fact that he’s accepted my apology and I can get on with my life and our relationship. 

This definitely has to do with how I was raised - there was never any healthily resolved conflict, only yelling and crying and holding grudges for years. I’ve harbored a lot of guilt for things I shouldn’t feel guilty for in the first place and I don’t know what to do with it all

Idk I’m just getting things off my chest I guess. Does anyone else ever feel this way? Also is there a more appropriate sub I could discuss this in???",01Nov2019,1
81,"Years ago, a wise man once told me that the difference between a clever and a wise man is that a clever man learns one new thing everyday but a wise man has to choose what to forget out of two items everyday.

Years later I’ve met with the guy and asked him if he still thinks so but he did not remember ever telling me such a thing.

Does that mean that he got so wise that he chose to forget this advice or does it mean that it wasn’t a wise thought to begin with because it got frogotten eventually?",01Nov2019,1
82,"I was hanging out at my friend's house last night and found an old scratch ticket at the bottom of my bag. I tossed the card at him thinking it was worthless, but to my surprise, he pointed out that I somehow didn't notice that I had a matching number that was worth 10 grand. I grabbed the card from him and realized he was right, and then my eyes quickly darted to the expiration date.... The card expired August 2019.... 

My heart sank and I was crushed. I've felt sick since last night, and can't stop thinking about how I could have paid my student loan off, or even move out to a more comfortable apartment.

It takes a lot to be so unlucky, that you win a lottery prize but only notice you won two months after the card expires.

Advice? Thoughts? I would love to have some input on the situation from a neutral party .. Everyone I've talked to in real life  just consoles me and tries to make me feel a bit better.",01Nov2019,3
83,"While reading another post I realized somethings: I just enjoy people for who they are. 

Their weird stuff that other people don't understand, their annoying traits that somehow become endearing to me. Over all I think the most important thing is I just like talking to them and learning about them. Exchanging conversations with someone is the best for me.

When I'm alone it kinda just feels lack luster and sad. I'm having a hard time just existing when others aren't there. I just think about the things that upset me in the best, make up stories to entertain my brain or see who can hangout next.

86,"*I've sometimes felt lonely in the past years (and even before), so for my 30st birthday I wrote about all the people that shaped me and my life throughout theses years. Yhat made me feel so good inside, because I realized what amazing people I've gotten to know and how they shaped my desires and my character. I hope I get to know just as many amazing people in the next 30 years. The order is very roughly chronological in order of getting to know, but there are quite a few exceptions. Feel free to share your thoughts. I do hope it's not all about that I'm creepy thinking about people I haven't seen in so long.*

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past 30 years I've gotten to know many people that changed my life. Impressive people, captivating people, loving people, smart people and passionate people. 30 days before my 30st birthday it's time to write about \~30 of them. Some know, some will never know, most probably don't care. I tried to keep to 2 sentences with a few notable exceptions. 

1-10 (Mostly 6-10)

1 My family always supported me, we're such different people but all believe in right and wrong. That's where those values come from.

2 E: Exactly 364 days younger than me and the first bubbly person I ever knew. Going to kindergarten and school with you instilled a lot of what I want in a friend (and partner).

3 R: When I moved you were the one trying to keep in touch with me; It meant a lot to me, because it wasn't easy then. I'm sorry we didn't keep in touch but I hope life turned out as good for you as it has for me. 

4 A: You're the one I could wrestle with and it's all good fun. I will never forget that time you told me about your Mom having cancer and your guinea pig dying when giving birth. You're the one that showed me the power of listening and protecting. Just so you know if I knew how to reach you, I'd tell you how I've stalked you, even know you're 'Maturarbeit' (high school thesis) was about Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. There's no doubt in my mind you're a strong and amazing person now even though we never talked since I moved when we were 10. (2 sentences right... I could write a book with memories and theories about you, I guess that's creepy...)

 

Age 10-20

5 JDe: You're the smart and idealistic person, that already knew as a teenager what was right. Thank you for being my friend in a new situation even though we're very different, we've respected each other. 

6 SHip: You're the coolest girl I knew back then, and I'm pretty sure even today you're still the coolest woman around. The week we spent in school together, doing stuff I didn't even really like, was so much fun just because of you and I hope you're doing great! 

7 SKTu: You're still deep in my mind, although you've just stopped talking to me so many years ago and I cried so many tears about knowing that even my ""best"" friend thought I wasn't worthy of support when making you feel uncomfortable. I still wonder if you ever read that letter, I still wonder what would happen if we talked again but even though there's still a jolt every time I see you from afar I'm convinced we'll never talk (about how our friendship ended). The idea of you is always a small part of me that I try to shut away, because I know it hasn't been real and has hurt me. 

8 Mnda: You're such a great person and thank you so much for reconnecting with me. You helped me in my most embarassing situation and you've always been great to talk to, also good luck to your artistic aspirations! 

9 MFre: Thank you for being a friend and trusting me, talking about your problems with me. We don't always speak the same language but we both believe in what's right. 

10 MFin: You are the one who kept me alive at times, when I was destroyed by the realization that my feelings don't align with reality. I hope you're having a great life far away from here and I know lot's of things have changed, but I still think you'd not just listen to me but also understand. 

11 SchuMon: You 2 brought me through the tough time during military, I learned not to give a damn and you also spoke to two sides of my needs. One a Casanova, the other a dedicated monogamous family man, and both understanding me so well as I was getting neither; family won in this life. 

12 JuDe: My best friend after school and you are the one that understood when I talked about my past and cared. Thank you so much for all the great times together and I'm happy you found your Dream woman :)

13 Aven: I still believe I meant something to you in that moment even though you disappeared afterwards. I believe we could have been a great couple, but I'm still thankful that you managed to make me feel appreciated by your smarts and your smiles; those memories I will cherish. 

14 Hell: Sorry about that silly nickname, you're nothing but kind and fun and everybody got to love your hair and your humour. I want to apologize for making you feel so uncomfortable when I thought it was a date and it clearly wasn't, it's been so many years but I realize that was definitely not my best moment. 

15 RandFrench: You brought out the worst in me, looking at you turned me on so much despite not knowing you. It's random that you are in my memory, we haven't talked a single word but staring at your beautiful appearance brought the primal thoughts on my mind; I guess it's called puberty.

16 2Bo: On the only crazy clubbing night of my life, I clearly wasn't ready for you 2 otherwise I'd have a naughty story to tell, damn. Years later I realized I had a side which I could've explored with you and it makes me fantasize about that moment and how I could've reacted instead. 

17 Lip: Thank you for not judging me when you thought I was staring at you but I was just lost in my feelings after spending a year building a castle of thoughts that would crush down on me soon after. You're sport skills and dedication are an inspiration for me, as is you're ability to talk to people. 

18 KaL: We only really talked for one lunch break and you opened up to me so much, probably too much, because we were in such alike situations in many regards; I listened well but I missed to react in kind. I wonder if I could react better if I got another chance and make you feel comfortable with me not just for one lunch but as a proper friend. 

&amp;#x200B;

Age 20-30

19 NoRo: Thank you my cool robot friend for being there when I broke down, seeing how I hadn't experienced anything and everybody else knew 'it'. I still remember you saying ""oh no, you're the good person"" and at least in this life you knew me better in that moment than myself! 

20 NoGr: Chocolate is our friend and we used it a lot while studying together. I hope you find your cure for your mental health, because you're an awesome person and I believe you can persist against all the people who want to make you someone different than you are. 

21 Vlk: You represent all my professors and teachers, who took time to actively support me. Without all of them I would never have become the skillful person I am, so thank you. 

22 Ela: It's an amazing story how we met, you're still my ""sister"", that I never had; Even if we lost a bit of our mantra. It's hard keeping a relationship based on understanding just over texts and you're far away, but I believe you're happy and that's what counts. 

23 Starlet: You're the person I've thought least about on all of this list, but that one moment with you was important for my development. I realized I could be a bad person and make a move on you although I was kind of your tutor and I consciously decided for not going down that horrible road and since then I've had a better understanding for right and wrong making me a better person. 

24 NB: Thank you for being my amazing love. Every time I feel your energy around me, I feel home and you're the one I should write a book about. I hope you can show all you are to the world as time reveals you. &lt;3 I am so happy I've found you and made you the central piece of my life, because you're so good for me. Of course you get my favorite number 24

25 MeLu: Being stuck in a train with you is a very good memory, and I was impressed by how you're almost more grown up than me while being almost a decade younger. Thank you for all the open talks even if you might have been a little weirded out by me at times.

26 Ans: Thank you for taking me seriously although I have so much less experience than you in our job. It's been a great ride.

27 Apt: You're a role model for me because you're a dedicated dad and yet still very good and precise at your job. I wonder how I will fare with all the stress, but I hope I will be a genuinely good person like you. 

28 MayRum: Thank you for being such a great friend from the first moment, helping me so much with moving to the U.S. Thank you for the countless insightful talks and just being a great energy-full person in general. I miss you in my life back in Europe but I know you are busy. 

29 Roe: We're so alike in so many things, I hope we can become friends even though I'm leaving the company. It's eye-opening that there are people I click with so much right from the start, it's a pleasure to work with you!

30 SkiTr: You and I both have this inner fire and it's so easy to talk to you even though we actually haven't spent that much time together. I'm sure you have demons, but you and I just see the world through similar lenses and I'm excited for going skiing with you again and talking to you just feeling mutual understanding.",01Nov2019,1
87,Hi! You probably heard about a few of these stories before. I’m 15 and the only thing in life I was ever good at were videogames. I’m in general a really sloppy person and I mess up a lot of things I do. I have no idea what I want to do for work or what I would be passionate about to go to work for all of my life. My grades are mediocre right now because I enrolled a hard high school which allows me to go to pretty much any college I like. I’m torn now between trying to make something out of my current passion or roll with school and see if something else could occupy my mind. The smartest thing to do probably would be to focus on school in case something changes but I don’t really see that happening soon. I’m torn and have no idea what to do.,01Nov2019,0
88,"Before today, my back and feet hurt every shift at work. Sometimes I decide to work 12 or 13 hour shifts for the overtime money, and I would do nothing but swear under my breath and shake my head at every little inconvenience. 
I broke down last night and really had to do some assessment of my life. The biggest thing I realized was that my headspace was always so negative. No matter what I was doing I was ALWAYS thinking in terms of “why can’t I” or “why do other people always...” I ended up reading a few articles about positive thinking and I’m giving it a try today. So far my pain is minimal, and my day is flying by. I may not be as efficient, but I’m also not killing myself anymore!! The day is flying by too. I hope this helps someone to give it a try with me!",01Nov2019,0
89,"I'm never really dramatic with that whole ""this year was the hardest of my life!"" But seriously I've had a crazy time and it's not even the end. I remember New Years vividly, because on January 1st at 7am the upstairs neighbors entire water heater emptied into our apartment and flooded it. They got drunk and kept their window open all night when it was -30°F (wind-chill not accounted for) The whole bedroom was destroyed and the next few weeks were terrible and high stress. Then as soon as everything was just done getting replaced, it flooded again!!!

My life has also felt like autopilot due to working overnights and just having no good sleep schedule. I finally just started my new job with a raise and a better schedule so I can feel alive again.

When I started work with this new company I stupidly financed a car because I didn't have the money to fix my old one, so I financed for zero down. Now, just this month I started paying that down faster. I will be raising my payment again next month I think and it'll eventually hopefully be paid off in 1.5yrs or less. 

I discovered a new passion for finances and eventually I want to help others.

I learned that my jobs insurance plan covers all prenatal and postnatal appointments as well as all appointments for your children until they are 18 months, as well as free dentistry until a certain age (12?). I can start thinking about babies! Long way to go until I have one but the thought is more tangible than ever before. 

We moved out of the old apartment and moved into a brand new one where our neighbor became our friend. This place is 50 dollars cheaper, 300+ square ft. Bigger, and in a neighborhood that I don't feel constantly scared in. 

My grandpa had a major health event and he's in the nursing home permanently now. He has a hard time communicating and doing things for himself after that event. 

As of today my dad just lost his job of 20 some years due to a shut down and on Monday he begins a new one. 

While working overnights I lost interest in a lot of the things I liked before, due to time restraints and never feeling like I can enjoy it. I've slowly started dipping into my old hobbies. 

There's been a lot of ups and downs and it's just weird to think that the year is coming to an end soon. A lot has happened and I think this year changed me already. The fact that time is sweeping away so quickly makes me feel weird. I don't know why the fact that it's November is striking me so hard.",01Nov2019,1

91,"If you like fireworks, and want your kids to get involved and enjoy some fireworks, fuck right off and take yourself and your family to a display. There is absolutely no need for you to have your own fireworks to set off in your backyard.

It's cheaper to go to a display as the entry fee is a fraction of what you pay to buy your own fireworks.

A display is set up and actually looks half decent instead of the shitey fireworks you set off one by one at home.

You're also just going to leave the rubbish lying about in the street for other people to deal with.

93,"For these past few weeks I've been in a bad mood. I'm stressed because of my grades in school. (Currently 16) and also work is a pain in the ass. Another problem too is people. Theres certain times I would stop by a teacher's class to say hi during lunch (keep in mind other students sit and chill before the next hour) and everyone just glares at me or just gives me a dirty look or just throw shade and take hella crap about me for something I never did to them. They're probably judging me. Idk if I'm depressed or have any other problems. I have a few friends that I talk to after school but they are mostly adults and I see them at my jiu jitsu classes, I have a few friends I talk to in school, and last I have a great friend group online.

I suck at math too, but this semester I've been trying so much harder than ever before and still getting disappointed on previous tests.

96,"In my last post, I talked about how I had a crush on one of my friends who I barely knew. Well, roughly a week later they're telling me that they like me in return after my best friend tells them I like them.

It's kind of awkward the way they told me. They made it clear that they want to date me, but at the same time feel like they wouldn't make a good partner due to the fact that they still love their ex despite not personally enjoying the persons existence. I make it clear that they shouldn't feel any pressure to days me because they need to do what makes them most comfortable and happy.

After that, they kept telling me that they loved me, or calling me cute, and we've had several phone calls where we just hung out and fell asleep. They've even come over to my house where they kept kissing my hand or cheek and we basically didn't stop touching one another (in a cuddly way. I'm flustered easy, barely was able to kiss their cheek in return.)

So, I really like them buy I feel awkward doing all of this without knowing if they're actually in the mindset of wanting to try things or not. And it feels like they're talking to me less and less, which is stressing my out. During one call they started talking really depressed and said something along the lines of ""I can't tell if I hate you."" which has really stressed me out. My best friend talked about how maybe they're saying that because of their abusive relationship that they previously had, and may just be confused.

Along with that, my best friend was told that my third friend who introduced me to the person I have a crush one, 'Doesn't like me as much as I think she does', which stresses me out as well. I'm not sure I actually thiught she liked me to begin with, I just thought she was kind of putting up with me. I have a long history of being obnoxious and loud, but she's gone out of her way to sit with me during the mornings before classes, so she can't dislike me that much, right?

Anyways, there's a lot of social stuff going on and I'm really confused about it all. ;~;",01Nov2019,0

99,"I'm 45 years old, I've blown up my life, and I honestly don't know what to do or where to turn next. I'm posting this on a throwaway account, because what I'm about to share is something I'm rather embarrassed about, and is something I have not been completely honest about with people in my life, including my family, friends, or even therapist.

A bit of background: In the last two years I became very disenchanted with my job. I was a low level but well paid executive for a company that I had worked my way up in without a degree. There was an incident where I had to discipline a bad actor at work, and in retaliation, this person made up a lie about me and reported it to HR. They said that I only hired young men, so that I could prey on them sexually, and that I was secretly having relationships with several of my direct reports. My accuser was a gay man, as am I, and this was later disclosed to me that part of the reason his accusations were indulged at all was because the HR department did not ""have a lot of experience dealing with same sex relationships in the workplace"", which I only mention to give context to how gross the whole thing was. While these accusations were ultimately proven to be complete falsehoods, the investigation was extremely embarrassing to me, as several of my direct reports and peers were questioned about my life outside of work and my behavior towards other men in the office. While I was never ""punished"", I was moved to a different office during the investigation, and when I was proven innocent, I remained at this new office, and there was nothing done to my ""accuser"", as punishment for lodging a false complaint. I should've gotten a lawyer, but my company had a lot of good lawyers and a lot of resources, and I was very intimidated at the time. 

After this 4 month ordeal, I became very depressed and suicidal. My saving grace was that every night I could go home to my dog, who had been my faithful companion for 14 years. I am was and am single, my partner of 8 years left me for another guy right before we were to move with my company, saying that he didn't want to leave the coast, and most all of my friends in the new city were from work. Having moved across country with this company, so I was a stranger in my community, and felt very isolated during this time in my life. Then, my dog died unexpectedly. 

He was my best friend. I know dogs don't live forever, but he was in fairly good health, then suddenly developed a cough and was breathing heavy, he died in my arms waiting for a diagnosis from the vet later that night of what we assume was heart failure. I didn't pay for an autopsy, as my vet kindly advised me that the $750 wouldn't bring him back. This heartbreak was where I can pinpoint the moment I cracked. I remember sitting in my car, sobbing uncontrollably, thinking that I would just drive home and kill myself. I had lost the last thing in my life that meant anything to me. Thankfully, I didn't follow through. Somehow I found the strength to find a therapist. 

In therapy I have been able to process the severe mental abuse I suffered as a child, the betrayal of losing my partner, the humiliation and anger I had about my job, and the grief I carry about my dog. I little over a year ago, I left my job and cashed out my retirement. I had saved up quite a bit of money. Being single in a relatively unfamiliar city with few friends allows you to save a lot, plus I was very well compensated. I couldn't work for that company for one more day. To be honest, I didn't want to work at all after all of that, but I didn't know where else to go or what to do. I didn't tell them why I was leaving, although I'm sure a few guessed. My therapist recommended committing myself for a while, as she was worried about my suicidal thoughts, but I decided that I could live off of my savings and cashed out retirement for a long time, even with the tax on withdrawing early. That was 14 months ago. 

When I left my job, I had originally planned on pursuing a career in audio journalism, radio and podcasting. I had started down that path in college, some twenty years ago, but was sidelined by a great job opportunity (with the above mentioned company) and left college without a degree. I haven't worked in journalism at all since then, and that was over 20 years ago. Over the past year, I've looked for entry level jobs in the field. I've produced exactly one independent story for a workshop I attended on beginners podcasting and audio reporting, (which was aired on local public radio) and have very much frittered away a lot of time, taken a lot of naps, gone on a lot of hikes, and done some traveling. My former job was more than full time, 50 hours per week minimum, and many weekends and holidays, and I don't regret taking this time, as I feel that I had given over a lot of my youth to the company, missing out on a lot of these things. 

I'm sorry this is so long. Thank you for reading if you've gotten this far. I'm writing this here because I am stuck. I am finding it VERY difficult to break in to radio, or audio journalism, or to even sit down and talk into a microphone about whatever's on my mind and make a podcast about it. I'm not very good at self-education; watching YouTube videos about how to use the tech involved in production is difficult for me. I feel like the world has passed me by, as I haven't had to keep up with technology at my old job. I feel like I'm 20 years behind every one else. There's a part of me that really does want to continue pursuing this, but there's also the depressed part of me that struggles to feel passionate about it. I know this is going to sound entitled or embarrassing or whatever (thus, the throwaway) but I'd really just like to find a nice guy and settle down and be a housewife. I love cooking and taking care of people. I love the idea of running a household for someone. I'm starting to run low on funds, so I'm having anxiety about having to find a job. I have no idea what I'm good at, or what I should do. Journalism and radio internships all want young students. The thought of working retail sends me into an anxiety attack, though that seems to be all I'm qualified to do when I look at job listings on Indeed and LinkedIn. I feel like I lack direction, and that really what I want is a partner to tell me what to do. 

I'm leaving this here as a last hope that someone out there has either experienced this in their life, which I know is probably just a run of the mill mid-life crisis, even though it feels like a tidal wave crashing down around me most days, or has some good advice for someone struggling with how to spend the next 45 years of their life. I know that I risked a lot, giving up my retirement and not having a plan to work, but honestly, it was either that or kill myself at the time. That's how I saw it, so I don't really need any lectures on my own stupid financial decisions. Believe me, I'm better at beating myself up about it than you are. I'd just really appreciate any advice or direction or ideas from any of you. 

Thank you.",01Nov2019,4
100,"Been going through a lot of hard shit along with the end of a 5 year relationship. In the past couple months I had days of being suicidal on and off. Gotten through the worst of that and making some positive progress in life, no longer want to die, but currently have no clue what I want to do with my life anymore. 

In the meantime I’ve developed this really strong sense that my time is coming to an end. I feel the need to let go of things and tie off loose ends, and have no motivation to start anything new. Everything seems to be fading away from me or coming to a close, and when I think about the future I just don’t see myself there. 

I’m not totally sure how to describe it other than that - just like all my energy has drained out but not in the agonizing way it has been whenever I’ve been depressed. It’s like a calm emptiness and a still sense that it’s all coming to a close whether I want it to or not. That either I’m going to die or the whole world is. And it makes me feel really anxious, but at the same time this sense that there’s nothing to be done but wait for it all to end. 

Has anyone else felt like this? Is this a common feeling? What do you do with it/how do you get over it?",01Nov2019,23
101,"I just turned 30 a month ago and I'm really fucking proud of myself. For a quick backstory, I was in a deep depression for years and tried to kill myself in my early 20s. I landed myself in the psych ward and after I was released, I suffered through years of self-destructive behavior and alcoholism, the latter of which is something I'm still working on but have been improving upon. I was in jail twice because I was a piece of shit idiot and have been in an ambulance more times than I care to admit. It turns out I'm bipolar and am now on the correct meds that have been helping so far.

In 2016, I had enough money saved up to quit my job and screw around for a bit. Fortunately, my main desire at the time was wilderness backpacking so I was able to reduce my expenses and take a year off work. I was able to find a job pretty quickly when I started running out of money and it allowed me to move 1000 miles away from home. It was tough but this is when I really started trying to get my shit together. 

I just had my review at a job I started last year as a senior engineer and they offered me a promotion to director of technology! I haven't accepted it yet but likely will. Whether I take the job or not, they're giving me a much bigger raise than I even expected (12%!) and I'm making more than I ever have before or ever thought I would make in my lifetime. I've been saving up to buy a house and I'm on track to have enough for a down payment next year if I find something I like. 

All of this is especially meaningful to me because I'm a woman working in a male-dominated industry. In my previous companies (California tech startups), I dealt with a lot of sexism and sexual harrassment. I had a director say to my face ""I want you to suck my cock"" and I've had a VP actually put his hands on me and rub my back. I'm so glad I left the world of tech startups behind and found a company that isn't filled with disgusting people.

I know that a career and house aren't all that there is to life, but I'm still really fucking proud of myself for getting to this point. I honestly thought I'd be dead by 30 by my own hand. I've never even contributed to a retirement plan until this year because of that. I just want to settle down and live in a nice house in a quiet suburb where I'm still close to downtown. 

My sister who's 10 years older and like a second mom to me told me that she's proud of me and I cried. She knows about all my fuck-ups so to hear her say that made me feel so good about myself for once.",01Nov2019,684
102,"Since I graduated high school my life has been on a steady downhill trajectory. I'm more unhappy now than ever before. I hate my job, I have no qualifications, I have tremendous financial debt. Nothing feels fulfilling anymore, nothing is fun anymore, nothing makes me happy anymore. I feel stupider and less qualified to do anything useful by the day. I can barely get out of bed in the morning, and sometimes I simply don't and miss work. I am so miserable all the time that I drag down everyone else around me. I ruin parties. I have ruined friendships. I've just about ruined any semblance of a normal life.

I've been in therapy for years, I've been on medication for years. I've seen specialists. For years and years I have been trying to turn this around. But nothing is working. It keeps getting worse.

For more than a decade I've been pretty sure I'll eventually kill myself. Not because I want to be dead, but because I want the suffering to stop. I am so tired of fighting and fighting and yet getting more and more miserable. I think it's almost time. I'm almost there now. It won't be today, it won't be tomorrow, but it will be soon.

I'm thinking the most painless way to do it would be to purchase a tank of inert gas, like helium or nitrogen, and connect a SCUBA regulator to it. I'll put on the mask so I can't breathe through my nose, put the regulator in my mouth, and just fall asleep forever. That sounds pretty nice. I think I might even enjoy that a bit. Either that or the trusty ol' shotgun in the mouth. It'll pretty much obliterate the brain stem.

Everything else isn't so reasonable. I want a new, different life, and a body, different with better genetics, but that makes me greedy. And I want to live a life of reasonable luxury without serious work. I can't commit to or hardly ever show up for anything, especially work, so that's on me too. 

People like me tell ourselves we could do something if we tried to excuse ourselves not trying, and to cover up that if we tried we'd be as ineffective as no effort at all, or likely make any problem worse.

Disclaimer:
1. I don’t know if this is where I am supposed to write this post, so I apologize in advance.
2. I am not an English native speaker, so I hope that my writing skills are good enough to convey everything I want to write about here (without typos or errors 😅).
3. Sorry, but this is a huge post. So my apologies in advance.
4. Some prior info is needed about me personally. I once had a girlfriend previous to this, but ended with her, because I couldn’t cope with her depression (and some other things... It’s complicated).However, I felt miserable for this and other issues for, tow and a half years, until a few months before this story starts.

— — — The story — — —

One year ago, I (23M, now 24) met this girl (22F, now 23) in choir rehearsals and we started to become friends, staying awake during the night talking about our life, speaking through several mediums (SMS, Messenger, Instagram, etc.) all of the time, talking about our most intimate thoughts, issues in our lives, problems, joys, etc. Basically, we were always talking non-stop, no matter if we were working, on rehearsals, or with other people.

This all started in the summer of last year, where I was finishing my master thesis, while abdicating my summer vacations to finish everything by September and she was doing a summer internship on a multinational company where she later did her master thesis and got her current job. However, in mid August, she went on several vacation trips with her family, or with her boyfriend’s family (23M, now 24). Yes, this girl has a boyfriend, and are on a relationship for over 8 years. However, we still kept talking. Her boyfriend occasionally remarked her that she was talking too much with me in his passive aggressive manner (or at least that is what I gathered from what she told me in the past).

Afterwards, in September, when her summer vacations finished and she went back to  work, we  were on a social event our choir organizes every year, and I suddenly noticed that I was in love with her. We were basically teasing each other, and she clearly wanted me to kiss her. I also wanted, but did not do it, because I knew she was in a relationship. A couple of days later, she told me that she was feeling guilty for what happened and for having feelings for me. I advised her to talk to her boyfriend, since hiding it could be worse of for their relationship. Back then, although I had feelings for her and started to understand this, I knew the situation I was in, so I advised her what I would have advised to anyone else: talk to her boyfriend about it.

She reluctantly spoke to him about this, even though it all started with him noticing that she didn’t seem to be feeling well. She told him that she had feelings for me, and, well... something worthy of a Mexican soap opera happened. He basically had a nervous breakdown and became mad with rage, yelling to her about ruining their relationship and so on. He then left her and she called me wheeling while I tried to console her that night. Meanwhile, she also found out that her boyfriend decided to drive into the middle of nowhere far from the city where we all live in. Therefore, she called his parents to tell him to come back home.

The following day, we kept talking about last night, how she felt about everything (her heart was crushed back then), and how her boyfriend was reacting to this. You see, her boyfriend, who was supposedly at his job, spent all day long calling her and sending text messages either blaming her for everything or asking her some miserable questions. Latter that day, they met themselves in the university, after work, and he just told her to “get off his face”. She went on with her life, as she had classes. Latter in the evening, me and her had rehearsal and afterwards decided to speak about everything. I wanted to say that I loved her, but unfortunately I did not have the time, because after the rehearsal, her boyfriend called her and wanted to speak to her about everything. I just told be careful with him, since he apparently was having neurotic behaviors and, to me, he didn’t seem trustworthy.

What she told me afterwards was that, they both talked it out, since nothing happened between us, then they went back to normal, and the following day, he offered her a promise ring with diamonds, as you do in these situations. I was chocked at everything and told her my opinion that he was not sane and was trying to imprison her in this relationship. She didn’t know what to say first, but after some weeks or months, she agreed with me.

A week or two after this, in the middle of October, she came to my house to what her a movie and, inevitably, we ended up making out and having sex. Then, during this week, we made out and had sex multiple times. I must admit that by this point, I was too possessed by my feelings of infatuation that I couldn’t control myself. And hence, I became, The Other Guy. During this week, I was the happiest I have been for years. However, after a week, she started feeling guilty again and told me, while crying and sobbing, that she did not want to carry on with me like this and only wanted to be friends. I was heartbroken ... We then had a few moments where we talked about this and she just told me that she had lust for me, while she still fell in love with her boyfriend. At this moment I thought she was just saying that to convince herself that she didn’t have feelings for me, but she refused this wholeheartedly.

Nonetheless, we kept talking everyday about everything wherever we were. We still hung out regularly after choir rehearsals and I knew I was in love with her, while she still denied everything.

Then, in mid-November, we were both going clubbing after choir rehearsal and, according to her, after a tiny bit of alcohol, her feelings for me came out. We made out during the night, before clubbing, during it and afterwards. Two days later, she went to the cinema with her boyfriend and afterwards started crying for betraying her boyfriend. She then told me that she once again did not want anything more than a friendship with me. I was once again torn, but I also thought that was feeling once again insecure about everything, so didn’t lose hope. Nonetheless, we kept talking regularly as we did before. After this, there were some minor moments where I felt really miserable about my situation, but they are unimportant in the big picture of everything.

Fast forward to the end of January of this year, where a lot of things are going wrong in her life (which they were, this story being just one of them). She was starting to have health issues, she wears having a lot of work, her exams at university were not going well and her sister was having mental health issues for several months. She was feeling so bad that she wanted to hangout with her boyfriend, who told her that he was having a dinner with her mother and asked her not to come. She found this strange, since they were in a long lasting relationship and now they considered each other’s family to be their own as well, so she went to see him. Afterwards, they were having one of the weirdest discussions ever. When she found him, he was at the mall, and started running away from her and hiding from her in stores, while she was trying to find him. Afterwards, they went to his car to have an argument. It went so bad, that she left the car and shut the door with strength. He decided to go after her and say “If you want to break my car (which she didn’t), then I’ll break something that belongs to you!”. Then he proceeded to grab her purse and rip it up in half. They then continued arguing until she just said “Boy! Am I glad that I cheated in you with that guy (me)!”. Then she left him there.

That night, and the days later, I was consoling her, bringing her to a restaurant to have dinner with me, then hanging out with friends and stuff. But after almost a week, her boyfriend called her and asked her to either end input there and then, or to continue their relationship if and only if she stopped talking to me and to leave the choir. She agreed to everything except leaving the choir, he then accepted and she notified me of everything and that our friendship ended.

I was obviously crushed and depressed, with low morale, a lack of desire to do anything and a wish to go to sleep and never wake up. I gradually got better after a couple of weeks, when my brother took me to Belgium for a week, which I adored. I was also getting better since I was seeing a counselor for a few months (and still am). Afterwards I got slightly better, being able to do stuff and be less demoralized, but I was still depressed. Also starting to have other friends in the choir helped me get better. I would like to note that some of these friends became my friends because they saw me really bad out of the sudden and started to talk to me.

Meanwhile, me and this girl almost stopped talking. She very rarely cam to talk to me to say about her status, like, when she found out that her health issues were because she found out that she had Lupus. However, she gradually noticed that she couldn’t just exclude me from her life. Som gradually she started to be less cold with me, and in late March, she told me that she regretted everything that she had done to me and asked me if we could still be friends (and only friends). I said yes, despite me being afraid, and soon afterwards she told her boyfriend that we were friends (and only friends), whether he liked it or not.

They broke up again, but after some days, she claimed that he didn’t care about me and only wanted to be with her, and was showing this by giving her gifts that showed her that he knew and cared for her, and that he changed. I did not believe a word of what he meant since, for me, he was an emotional abuser and one of the most awful persons I have ever met, and I know for a fact that a person doesn’t change in a couple of days. But alas, the pay reunited.

Both me and her tried to rebuild our friendship, and for a while it seemed to be working. But, then, by the end of April, they got engaged and after some months, I noticed that their relationship was impacting they way I was seeing love in general. This had corroded me into doubting every relationship that I saw and soon afterwards, I noticed that she was feeding these doubts. Then, I also noticed that she was starting to drift away from me as a friend by not talking as much and then she just stopped. By then, it was mid summer. I tried once or twice to talk to her and have a normal conversation, and, while we appeared to have a normal conversation, I felt that she didn’t care at all about me, so during my summer vacations, I decided to stop talking to her.

When this year summer was finishing and our choir rehearsals restarted, we sometimes spoke to each other, but very superficially, when compared to beforehand. Then I noticed that we were no longer friends and that she didn’t care about me. We just have regular interactions because we have friends in common, and still belong to the choir where we first met. And while I still am going through a lot, I have come to some conclusions, that I hope may be of guidance to all.

— — — Conclusions and Remarks — — —

1. Some friends have advised me to leave this choir in order to never see this girl again and to forget about her, but it would mean that she is more important than both all of my other friends, and the pleasure that I get to be a part of the music world (I love music, and it is one of my passions). It may be tempting to just leave these kind of people away from your life, remember that your life is more than them.
2. There is more to abuse than just physical or sexual abuse. Emotional abuse is also a issue a lot of people face in their relationships and you should never have to endure this, no matter the excuse. This girl said that he did nothing wrong because she cheated in him, and he was right, but this is no legitimate excuse for any sort of abusive behavior. And note that I am not making these things up. Emotional abuse is a thing and while there is still a lot of debate on the psychological community about it, they all agree on it’s existence (for more, read [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_abuse) or just google it).
3. Do not be The Other Guy/Gal, no matter the situation. If the other person loves you, then they should do everything in their power to show you this, including breaking up with who they are currently in a relationship. It may sometimes be hard to realize this, but don’t martirize yourself. You are worth so much more.
4. Friends do not corrode each other in any way whatsoever. No matter if it is in your love life, or any other facet of your life. If they start doing this, then alert them or leave them. It is normal to make mistakes in life and hurt others, but doing this regularly is no mistake, even if they are doing this unintentionally.
5. If you are feeling bad or have a bad feeling about the future of your life, seek help, no matter if it is help from friends, family or professional counseling. While I had previously frequented a counselor when I was at university, I was somewhat reluctant this time, but it was worth it.
6. Love yourself. Previous to have meeting this girl, I thought that I was just a guy with nothing special, but ironically, she showed me otherwise, both by having feelings for me, and by hurting my feelings (I know this seems paradoxical). And furthermore, if you don’t love yourself, how will you find someone else who will?
7. There is more to life that romantic love. One of the reasons I was miserable before meeting this girls, was because I craved this romantic love, and forgot of other ways of being happy, and it took me a while to figure this out.
8. There is a big difference between a healthy relationship and a stable relationship (wether it is a romantic one or not). Just because you are in a relationship with someone for years, it doesn’t make it healthy. Always be aware of this in life.
9. This has brought me to the conclusion that sometimes, loneliness isn’t a state of having no one and feeling depressed, but a state where one can meditate about one’s life.
10. It is better to be lonely, than to be with bad company. And I would like to point out that, if you have friends and family that supports you, then you are not lonely.

— — — Issues I am still figuring it out — — —

Despite everything have written so far, I still find myself with some issues in my life because of this misfortune.
1. While this was an important thing to focus about in my personal life, it sidelined other issues I was faced with and still am, mainly my professional life. However, this is another topic and I will not go into depth about it.
2. I found out that what I craved and wished for beforehand isn’t romantic love, but actually just affection, no matter it being romantic, platonic, from friends, etc. While I found out of other people that give me this, I still want more in my life, especially when I do feel lonely in life, and sometimes, it may be difficult to cope with this.
3. One thing I also am having issues is the fact that I want to find my significant other, but it isn’t something to find. It’s just someone who, when you least expect, will come to you. However it is sometimes nerve wracking and gives me anxious thoughts when I think that there are a lot of people my age who are in healthy relationships or maybe even married while I am not.
4. While I found out that have a lot of friends in my life, I also found out that sometimes my loneliness derives form the fact that I do not do the things that I want to do because I have no one else to do them with, wether it is going to a concert, travel to another place, or whatever it may be.
5. I want to meet new people and make new friends (and once again, eventually find my SO), but I don’t know how I can do this without making any big changes in my life. I don’t want to start another hobby just to meet new people, or go on dating platforms like Tinder, but, at the same time, I am not happy with my current situation.
6. While this has given me many lessons and has given me new friends, it has occasionally (but rarely) brought me some issues in regards to confidence with other people. And this coming from a guy who wishes for affectionate relationships.
7. I still find myself affected by this love affair I have presented you with. Normally I find myself enraged with both the girl and even more with her now fiancée. I know that, with time, this will fade away, but I don’t want it to last long and I feel that it is lasting a long time.
8. While I have come a long way since I have had my heart broken many times by this girl, I still find that sometimes it is difficult to interact with her and just wish for her to leave my life, even thought it will not happen for a lot of reasons.

If you are still reading this, then I am impressed you have the patience to read this.
If this has helped anyone, than I am glad.
If someone has any recommendations for me on my issues, then please do share (they are somewhat meant to be questions)

I bid you farewell and good luck on this quest that is life.",01Nov2019,1

111,"Long story short, i've been in denial about a lot of things in my life. Example, me needing to see a professional. It took years for me to muster up the courage and talk to a professional. And well, when I finally did, I cried my eyes out...and honestly, it felt good. Im at the stage now where I try to work on telling the parts of me that I cover up. Trauma that I force myself to forget, things I pretend to not know because thinking about it would cause an immense amount of stress. Ive reached a milestone in my life and i've uncovered a path to recovery. I was never optimistic about recovering and living the best life that I could.

112,"I am going to try to make this as short as possible but there is a whole lot. I have been seeing tons and tons of doctors for these things that have been happening but I have found no answers. 

This started in 2018 and it has never stopped and things kept adding on to it. I have lots of symptoms, and I am not sure if they are all related but I am going to post them all anyways just in case. 

First symptoms: I have always suffered from anxiety but in the past year and a half things got way worse and I had very severe anxiety and depression. I have been seeing a therapist pretty consistently for over a year. My depression has become very tolerable within the past month but my anxiety has always stuck. I take Hydroxyzine (Atarax) at 25MG 4 times a day 

Second symptoms: Knee pains started around November of 2018 and since then they have developed into joint pain in every joint, but my knees always stayed the worst. I also have psoriasis on my elbows, knees, and ankles. We sort of ruled out juvenile arthritis but not really. I take Naproxen 500MG twice a day and recently started Sulfasalazine 500MG twice a day for joint pain. For my psoriasis I recently have been using Triamcinolone Acetonide .025% at night. 

Third Symptoms (biggest): At the beginning of 2019, I started to experience shortness of breath after minimal exercise and it took hours for me to be able to catch my breath. I still have chest pains and shortness of breath all the time. I was recently diagnosed with mild exercise induced asthma but it is very small and I have not yet tried an inhaler. Then in March 2019, I out of no where started to hyperventilate after a practice (I did winter guard/ color guard). The hyperventilation included the pins and needles, but it went away after a couple minutes. I assumed it was an anxiety attack and thought nothing of it. Then later that day after my competition performance, after I left the floor I dropped to the ground and had the same hyperventilation and pins and needles except this time it was worse. From then on I had them about 4-5 times a week, and each time got worse. I am not in a sport anymore, so I have them maybe after 2-3 weeks and they are always have exercise and once was from crying. These are now my consistent symptoms that get worse every time;

\-hyperventilation 

\-pins and needles on tongue, mouth, nose, arms, hands, legs, and feet

\-unbearable severe pain in my arms and legs

\-crying from pains

\-unable to move 

\-extreme dizziness 

\-confusion and I ""black out"" in a way where I don't remember what was happening around me or who was there but I have stayed conscious 

\-tenseness and cramping of hands (search of ""hands with hypocalcemia"" for image)

\-muscle weakness 

\-shakiness

\-blotchy skin

\-Weird temperatures and feelings around my body

These ""attacks"" last about 15 minutes but they totally wipe me out and leave me tired and sore from the next few days. I have been told this is Hypocalcemia and also told it is Alkolotic Tetany (I think these go hand in hand) but, I haven't taken steps to prove this, I just got a phone call from my primary doctor about a month ago after he saw a video of me in this state. 

Other things maybe worth mentioning is;

\-Scoliosis

\-Constant fatigue

\-Constant headaches

\-Constant back aches 

\-Constant stomach pains that occasionally get very unbearable 

\-Constant constipation 

\-Often cold

\-Frequently gets sick

\-For more than a year I have had symptoms of a UTI

120,"I'm an older student back in school for mechanical engineering.  Its definitely challenging, but the fact that my family supports me and helps out so I dont have to work helps out alot so I know I'm very lucky for that but that's what they want for me anyways so I can apply all my time to school.  I am able to get by just with the basic things like food and gas and having a phone. I think it will still be a few more years before I'm done.

The thing is I've really kind of shut myself away over the years and pretty much have no social life due to different circumstances.  I had a relationship that ended some years ago which was a big part of losing touch with alot of people, and some other friends I just grew apart from and eventually stopped communicating.  I stay off social media like Facebook and instagram because I just dont feel those things would be good for me, amongst other reasons.

I've been getting more and more lonely though and recently I heard about my ex dating someone I know and for some reason it just kind of fucked me up inside and brought back some hurt emotions.  I feel like it affects me because of the fact I barely have any friends and people to talk to and I haven't really gone on any dates or anything.  I can't anyways because I honestly couldnt afford it. So that's why I'm debating getting atleast a part time job so I have some spending cash to be able to take a girl out or go out to places to meet someone.  I feel like being back in the work place could potentially maybe help me find some friends atleast too.

I think its getting a bit more serious too that I get out and try and get some kind of social life because mentally I think I'm starting to suffer.  I think at times I'm practically depressed especially because of what I found out recently and other stuff from the past that bothers me at times. I just dont want the job to affect my grades either because I've done school and work before and it's tough.  Even a counselor told me one time ""while you're working, other kids are studying,"" and that kind of hit me.  This was when I was working still full time a couple years ago and planning to go back to school.  So yea I'm debating getting a pt job so I can afford to do things like go out and not go crazy, or should I stick it out and just focus on school and maybe I'll find a 1 in a million gf that is okay with me not having money until I'm done with school?

Tldr: still in school, but thinking about getting a part time job so I can have some spending money to find a gf and get a social life because I'm getting lonely as fuck",01Nov2019,2
121,"i've been trying to change for a while, to improve myself and be a better person, trying to overcome the depression and anxiety that i have, im this week is the first step i hope so to the right direction, i have accomplished one week without fap(an addiction that was making my life more miserable than it was) and this makes me proud you may think that its a stupid think an user in a post that i saw a while ago said that to start feeling better with yourself you must celebrate your little steps. To be honest it was a hard week but in a way i'm happy that i didn't do it, i manage to control myself, a thing that for a long time i couldn't do. 

The next thing i'm gonna do its try step by step loving myself, i know it's going to be hard and i know that i need a therapist to help me with this problem but until i get the money im gonna try to do my best, i feel like at this point if i don't try to do something for me even without therapy im going to be stuck in this feeling(self harming mindset) that may kill me at some point if i don't overcome it. 

A goal that i have before this semester of Uni ends its ask out a girl that i'm attracted to, even if she rejects me i need to do it to lost that fear of rejection that  has inhibited me from being able to date girls that i may had a chance but i'll never know because i didn't try, so i dont wanna have that awful feeling again that it could have been but ill never knew cause i didn't try.

Wish me luck in this trip and i wish the best to everyone.",01Nov2019,2
122,"My life just doesn’t feel stable at the moment. I’m going through the university application process and I’ve just been rejected from my dream university.  I feel crushed, demotivated and depressed. I was hoping that this would be my escape, that it would enable to fulfill my dreams. What’s worse is that no one cares enough and I have no one to talk to. My mum tells me to move on, my friends have all been going out to parties without me and I’m just stuck at home with my thoughts with a constant sadness growing over me. I would have felt better if my group of friends had comforted me or tried to take my mind off of it, instead that stable group I thought I had seems to have vanished. I just feel so lonely and vulnerable and I feel like I’m slowly becoming misanthropic.",01Nov2019,10

reminds me of when facebook banned me for a political post in which no profanity or foul language was used because it got the attention of 80k people and demanded i give them my drivers license and social to verify me. I thought it was rediculous so erased my account and never looked back.",01Nov2019,0
