1,On my second year of college sorta been taken it slow. I’m about to probably fail my comp sci 2 class cause I straight up learned nothing. My fault really I suck at learning from online resources. So I feel college isn’t for me. So if it is what is. All my peers at my jobs basically say I’d be insane to give up cause it’s terrible working minimum wage. Not to mention I have epilepsy and my meds cost a ton so I’d prob have to live with someone just to get by. Not to mention breaking it to my parents that I’ve given up after acting like everything’s fine. I don’t know what to do anymore lol. Fuck,25Apr2019,1
2,So basically back in September I was in Paris France for an 8 hour lay over and what I did to pass time was use tinder so used for like 30 mins and I added few girls snaps none replied except one.  This girl that I added was really cute so we talked and talked for like a few hours till my plane came (side note: I don’t speak French she barley speaks English I used google translate) when I was talking to her I didn’t think we would stay in touch fast forward to the present (7months later) we talk almost every day still using google translate it tough but we both caught feelings for each other and I really want to go to France and see her. These are the problems that I’m running into the language barrier is the toughest part and like I feel like it going to be hella awkward in person. Another problem everyone says I’m stupid and I should go for it. Something I don’t understand is how the hell did I catch feelings for a stranger. Friends tell me it’s not gonna work out and they are probably right. But I can’t just cut her off after all that time of talking. So at this point I don’t know what to do or how to feel.,25Apr2019,2
3,"I'm in my early twenties, had one ""relationship"" (closest thing I've had to it), and one ""situationship"". 2-3 year gap between both. That's as far as my experience goes, and to be honest I can't see myself being with anyone in the future. I crave love, affection, and sex like all people do. But I just fill the void by reading shitty fanfiction and novels. I have started to no longer desire actually being with someone for some reason. Instead of envisioning my future with a spouse and 3 kids like I've done since I was a child, I'm starting to imagine myself alone. Leading a successful life on my own and traveling. It's not a sad or happy thought to me, it just is. Like I'm not meant to be with another person. 

From my experience, when it comes to actually being in a relationship, I feel like maybe I just don't know how to have a healthy relationship. My past left much to be desired. I don't find myself wishing to actively seek out a partner anymore. And yet I feel jealousy when I read about love between characters or see the love between two people. It kind of brings me down. Just knowing that I won't ever have somebody think of me in such a beautifully tender way or caress me so lovingly.

I would love to be loved but I just can't see it ever happening anymore.",25Apr2019,8
4,"I went on a date a couples days ago, and as a literature major, most people tend to ask me who my favorite author is. I told her, and explained why. I didn't think much of it, but today she was talking to me about this book she just started reading, and it became clear that she was reading a book from my favorite author. Now we're talking about the different parts of the book and I feel really excited to have a book discussion the next time we see each other. I've told a lot of different dates about my favorite author, but I've never had one go out and want to read works by them. We're both excited for our next date, and I feel really good about her. Just wanted to share.",25Apr2019,40

8,"I know you are going through a lot right now, for this last month or so hasn’t been anything close to alright, and that is totally fine. Life threw a curveball at you, and it is totally acceptable to be feeling how you are feeling. I know you are so confused as to why everything has happened like this. I also know that you are strong enough to get through this. This is just going to be a bump in the road that is going to be paved over in time. 

That’s all this needs… time. 

Now, hopefully you know this feeling of emptiness and hurt will never be completely gone. it will always be there.

This is not going to be easy

There are going to be sleepless nights, which you have already experienced. There will be moments where one second you feel the highest of highs then switch to the lowest of lows within moments -- but as you already know about this due to experiences you have already faced.  
    
Just promise me please that you will never give up. Your grandpa does not expect that from you, he knows the real you. He knows you are a fighter. 

Remember to tell yourself, he isn’t suffering anymore. Although he did leave behind some emotional pain that will never leave…think of all the joy and happiness he brought to all the people in his life, especially you. 


He didn’t do this to hurt anyone.

I promise you that.

	In due time you will see this was needed: it might not be what you wanted but it was needed.  Look how close everyone has become because of this That is sometimes what it takes though, sometimes a tragedy can be more of a blessing than anything. 

	And I know you feel like nothing can go your way right now but trust me it’s coming. This hurt and pain will all Passover: but as I said it will never be completely gone. The pain will just not be as severe.

	You can do this… I know it. 

	I got your back 1000%...  just know that. 

	Always.

	Best Wishes, 
Self

13,"Ok, this is a long ass story. Going to try to make it as short as possible. I’ve worked for this company for about 3 years. It’s a medical practice with multiple locations, founded and owned by my boss. So in actuality he is everyone’s boss, as well as the company’s chief of surgery. He’s married, with 3 kids. He’s your typical older(than me), very wealthy and powerful surgeon who thinks he’s untouchable - with a little extra added ego because it’s his company. 

Years ago it was a small company with only 5 locations in one state. In the last few years he began to bring in investors that have now spread us out to 20 offices all across the US. Everyone is overwhelmed with the work load and our offices have turned very corporate very fast to say the least. There has been a lot of growth and employee turnover as you can imagine so there are only a few “OG’s” left. My role used to include overseeing a few accounts, overseeing a handful of staff, and some clinical work in procedures. Now i am in charge of multiple, million dollar accounts. 30+ people report to me. I have a corporate card. You get the idea. Ive secured a high level position in the company just by sticking through the shit of the transition. I mean i work my absolute ass off, and i know our field like the back of my hand, but they would never hire someone with my qualifications into this position now. Anyways, another thing this means is that now i travel quite a bit, and it’s usually with my boss. 

I’ve always worked with him, and I’ve picked up on vibes from the very beginning that he was interested in me but nothing has ever come of it. But that was the first year. When the company started changing, we worked on a few projects together and then i quickly became his right hand. I really want to believe that it was just because i work hard as fuck, and I’m good. However.. every time he sees me he looks me up and down. He stares at my lips while I’m talking to him and back and forth between them and my eyes. We text back and forth pretty often, mostly about work but sometimes other stuff. We’ve gotten much closer in i would say the last 6 months. And the looks, and texts, joking, and out of office communication have gotten much more frequent, even normal in the last 6 months. 

He’s smart. This isn’t your typical story of your boss making comments about your appearance or flirting with you outright or touching you inappropriately. Remember it’s taken me literal years to be sure about this. Instead of those typical moves he makes very very subtle ones. One example is a comment: “don’t ever put anything on your company email that you wouldn’t want everyone to see.” He won’t call or text me late at night, just send me a useless email related to a project we are truly working on at an odd hour. He offers to buy me things constantly: new scrubs, new glasses because he noticed that mine were bent, or a new phone because mine has a crack in it. I always decline, but when we are together he pays for everything and buys me little things here and there. Calls me to his office during the day to ask me questions he’s already asked me 100 times, or to remind me to finish a project that he knows I’ve already completed. Undressing me with his eyes every time i get to his doorway. All things that no one else in the company would pick up on. They know we work together on medical projects, we have to. 

When we travel is when he really steps up his game. We usually travel in a small group with some other colleagues or a few of the doctors. Wether it’s a courtesy dinner with all the doctors, a meeting with a possible new investor or supplier, or him treating his employees to dinner and drinks - there is something planned every night of the trip. He has managed to get me alone twice. The first time wasn’t that bad. After our NYC area holiday party we walked manhattan and had drinks and we talked. Again, no inappropriate comments or touching, but he bought us a $700 bottle of champagne. We stayed out late. Around 5 am they closed the bar and we said goodbye and i took a cab back to my hotel. He got me to come out under the guise that some other employees would be meeting us there, and they conveniently all changed their minds. He did some suggestive things on that trip for sure but nothing like this time. On our most recent trip, he got as ballsy as he has yet. He was buying me drinks after a medical rep in the area that we met with had taken off for the night. He proceeded to “show me” the old fashioned way we used to preform a certain surgery by drawing it out on my legs with his hand. If you don’t know where your common femoral vein is, google it. That’s when the surgeon makes the first incision in this procedure. Not somewhere you really touch an employee, or anyone in front of a bar full of people. 

He insisted on walking me back to my room. I have been accused of being naive in my life, but even i see where this is going now after the whole surgery reenactment. So i reached in for a hug at the same time i was saying “good night!” We were standing in my doorway at this point, his elbow resting on the door, holding it open. When i went in for the hug he picked me up. I am still so shocked. Me still in his arms, he pushes his way into my hotel room, shutting the door. When he set me down i stepped back with one foot and reached around him, opening the door back up. I said again, “ok have a good night, thank you for dinner.” He backed up a little but still made one last ditch effort by pointing out a mole i had on my chest and asking if i had seen it. His hand was pretty much down my shirt. I finally got him out, and he sent me a text minutes later reminding me to put my leftovers in the fridge. When i didn’t respond he called me, then sent another text asking if i needed help finding where to put them. 

In the office sometimes he will scoot or pull me over by my arm in order to have a better view of a surgery, or push my chair up to my desk. He likes pushing me around like that, i can tell. Hardly ever touches me though. He loves to pick on me, boss me around, make me jump to his beck and call, but these were his first actual blatant advances toward me and they were not the only ones that night. I wasn’t surprised he would try something, but i was shocked how hard he was trying this night. I had never seen him act like this. 

Get ready for the part I’m most freaked out about: the next day in the office he asked me to sit down with him to talk because he had some questions. We had around a 10 minute conversation about where i see myself in the company in the next 5-10 years. He told me to stick with him and he would take me as far as i could go. In my mind this whole conversation was subtext for one of about 10 possible things he could have really meant. Was it a threat, a proposition, a real opportunity, a slight sign of respect after he realized it wasn’t gonna happen?

I’m dancing on a dangerous line, i know. Especially because at first i found his interest in me annoying and slightly disgusting. He’s married, a domineering know it all surgeon. Come on, how typical. No thank you. Now i find myself thinking about him and even catch myself fantasizing about what it would be like to let him spoil me and have his way with me. Push me around for real, like up against a wall maybe. Listen guys i am not this woman, i hate this woman. Please understand what a huge turn on it is to have someone that rawly attracted to you. The man literally wants to rip my clothes off. You can see it. He has no earthly idea how i feel. I’ve been purposely and very carefully coy with him - always, but sometimes i wonder what it would be like if i let him. 

I’m in a 3 year relationship with a good ass man. The love of my life. I would NEVER purposely jeopardize what we have found in each other. I know some will say that I’m jeopardizing it just by being in this situation, but its a tricky one. I feel so guilty for thinking some of the stuff I’ve been thinking about. I know that this whole story is pretty much a, “well, that’s where it starts..” , but not everything ends in an affair. Some people can manage to be faithful and professional. 

I think it’s possible that sometimes to be successful in a corporate, male dominated environment you have to know how to play the game a little bit. Your looks get you in the door and your brain keeps you there kind of thing. I’m not sure what the smartest way to play this out is, or if i even have any control over it at this point. I don’t know how long i can slyly fend him off before he figures out what I’m doing and gets pissed off. If he feels rejected or embarrassed in any way by me i believe he will make my life a living hell every day. I’ve seen him do it to others. He is an unbearable, micromanaging monster. People are scared of him. I’ve convinced myself that my situation is better than the alternative. I’ve managed to dance the line for a while now but i need some advice. I can cut and leave this company, that’s an option. If i do i will most likely go back to school (I don’t have my associates - i believe i will take a large pay cut to work elsewhere). Unless i have to, i don’t want to. What would y’all do in this situation? Is there a way to best navigate it to avoid shit getting weird?",25Apr2019,17
14,"I'm writing this with a heavy heart, not for attention or pity, but rather because if I can atleast write it out it feels more real to me, and will hopefully allow me to grasp the situation. Yeah, your parents fucked up. Yes, you have every right to be angry with them. You are almost 18, then you can get out and you dont have to look back. I always knew I did not have alot of money, but lately things have taken a turn for the worst. We had no food for the first time in forever. Our phones don't work. Today my mom's car broke down, another thing we cant pay for it. We cannot afford to live in the house we do but my mother refuses to leave because she loves it. We cannot afford to feed our farm animals. I broke down today with my boyfriend and told him everything. He was so kind to me he just told me he was going to pick me up and get me out, at least for a few hours. He did he's the only thing that makes me feel normal anymore and I am so grateful for him. I snapped at my best friend. I felt terrible. I cant tell him how I feel though because he wouldnt get it, he has never had to worry about if the power will go out for good, or how much debt his family is in, or how they could take away the house at anytime. I'm filled with such contempt and despair, I want to be sick. Physically sick. They have been taking all my brother's money to pay for bills. No one has money on credit cards anymore. For the first time in forever, we had to go inside the gas station and pay for my dad's car's gas with cash. Things just keep getting worse. I work as a cashier and am getting another job, but I cannot possibly pay for anything for the, they're too far gone. I'm sick with my parents, they never tell us anything except for my brother. That's how we found out. I hate being at home. It feels alien, like its rejecting me, laughing at me. I'm a prisoner, we cant sell the house because of all the work that has to be done. I feel useless and empty as I sit on my bed, listening the to my parents laugh in their room, acting like nothing is wrong as Beach House's ""Space Song"" ironically plays in the background. I want out. I can't do this anymore. School is almost out, which means I can work, work = money, money = a chance for freedom. I hate it. I hate money, I have alot of things right now. But i am also grateful. Grateful for my boyfriend and all his patience. Grateful for being able to go to school and pretend that I'm not falling apart. Grateful for being able to be alive, and see the rolling green hills on the way back from my track meet today. Grateful for the warm sun on my skin, grateful for my sister and my brother. But most of all, grateful for my parents because I know what to strive against. To hope that I will not end up like them. That is what burns inside me and propels me to push forward. 

Thank you for anyone who actually read this all. I'm just letting off steam. I hope you all are doing well.",25Apr2019,4

17,My mom found my old journal from about 3 years ago and photocopied specific journal entries. This journal has a bunch of entires and drawings about wanting to die/kill myself.  I don’t feel this way any more but now I don’t know if I should pretend I don’t know she found it or I should confront her about invading my privacy. I thought I had thrown that journal out years ago and now I’m really worried my mom thinks I’m going to kill myself.,25Apr2019,1
18,"My depression is definitely hereditary, both my mom and grandma suffer from it. But I know I have severe depression and anxiety because of how my grandma raised me. I grew up with my mom, grandma and two sisters. My mom and grandma would psychologically abuse me. I feel they singled me out because I knew that my dad was cheating on my mom and I didn’t say anything, even though I was 5 years old and didn’t understand that cheating was a bad thing. And I think it’s the fact that my dad would always joke that I was his favorite daughter. 

They treated my sisters with respect and spoiled them.  My grandma and mom would always tell me to not even think about college because they wouldn’t help me pay for it. But they helped both my sisters. 

My mom would always say she wished she had an abortion so I wouldn’t have been born. So it was just a habit of both my mom and me wishing each other dead.

One day, my grandma heard me repeat it back to my mom. So after I got off school (I was in 9th grade at the time) my grandma picked me up from school and told me that my mom died. She said it was my fault for my mom dying. She wouldn’t tell me how or any details. She just made me stay in my room until further notice. For 12 hours, I literally thought my mom was dead. The next day, my mom came home. She had stayed at a friends house to scare me. That’s just ONE of the many times they would fuck with me. Living with them made me really suicidal. They caught me cutting myself in the shower ONE TIME. So, if I ever took an extremely long shower, they’d call the police without even asking me if I’m ok. I’d be in the shower thinking everything is fine and have firemen banging on my door forcing me to come out even if I had soap in my hair.  And from there, I’d be involuntarily driven to the hospital in a cop car for evaluation (with my hair still dropping.) Even if I was just taking a shower. It happened three times. It was really a nightmare growing up.  Thankfully, at 17, I moved out with a boyfriend. Now, 28, I live with a roommate. I forgave my mom when I was 24. She genuinely tried to reconnect with me and she’s now the best mom and we see each other often. She does even help me financially if I ever ask. 

My grandma never asked for forgiveness. She thinks it’s cute that she would play mind games on me. She’s a cute old lady and everyone adores her, so everyone thinks I’m a bad grand daughter for never visiting or answering her calls. I don’t tell anyone of the horrible way I grew up because I don’t like people feeling sorry for me. But I do feel bad cause she’s getting very old and I know she desperately wants me to visit her but she’s the main reason I’m not mentally stable and can not form any healthy relationships. I feel that I didn’t have a childhood because of her. Both my sisters went to really good colleges and graduated and now have really good high paying jobs and I’m struggling to make ends meet. I’m 28, still in university because I didn’t qualify for financial aid until I was 24. (My mom refused to claim me when I was 17 so my dad claimed me and he “makes too much” according to fasfa.)

I hold a lot of anger towards my grandma. 

When my grandma calls me, I try to be civil and talk to her. Sometimes, if I’m in a good mood, I’ll tell her about my day. She acts like nothing happened, and I tend to snap at her a lot. Then she tells everyone I’m so mean to her.",25Apr2019,6
19,"I really do enjoy good food, I’m not a picky eater, and I can afford to go out to eat with friends and family on occasion. For a couple months this past year I was so busy that I would only eat when I really had to and it just became a habit. 

Lately I’ve been having plenty of time to eat, but I get bothered by the fact I have to go out of my way to either cook or look for a place to eat or spend money. I don’t know if it’s my body just used to eating very little and my laziness to cook/get food or if I’m starting to develop an unhealthy eating habit... does this sound bad?",25Apr2019,2
20,"My childhood was rough. Lived in several different places in the first 13 years of my life. Didn’t have much money (until my dad started a business). Struggled in school due to having learning disabilities. Got suspended from school many times. Was arrested five times before the age of of 20 including a DUI. Lived with an abusive narcissistic father who made my life a living hell. I’m 28 now and even though I’ve have a stable career and a professional license and a side business that is doing well. I still suffer from low self esteem depression and anxiety.

Imagine your father yelling and belittling you all the time for the slightest things. Imagine having your father forget your birthday and even ruin it by ignoring you the entire day. Imagine a father who threatened to take you out of school because you were struggling. Imagine a father who threatened to disown you if you didn’t get accepted into university. Imagine a father who destroyed your Xbox for getting a 96 on your exam. Imagine a father who strangled you for standing up to him after I refused to hand him a remote control that was sitting next to him. Imagine a father of ran you over in the driveway in order to teach you a lesson. 

Even though I left home, started a career and married his attitude continued. I’m aware that my father’s early life was hard. Living in extreme poverty and growing up with an abusive parent but it doesn’t excuse his behavior. 

My wife whom I’ve known for nearly 10 years now. Told me to stop being a victim, and wallowing in self pity. I’m really trying but it’s hard. It’s impossible given the emotional abuse and neglect I’ve suffered. Yes I have a successful side business and a professional career but my PTSD, depression and anxiety hinders me from achieving my full potential. It’s hard to get over the trauma you experienced as a child. 

I know having a shitty childhood isn’t an excuse to treat people like shit or make bad decisions. I know that I’m responsible for my life now but I still feel waves of depression and sadness and I deal with it by yelling at the wall or punching a pillow. I want to break the cycle and give my future children the childhood I never had growing up. What can I do?!

I’ve had therapy several times over the years without everlasting positive results. I want to have kids but I’m not sure if I want any because I’m afraid that I might treat my kids the way my father treated me growing up. Worse, I’m scared that my father will treat my kids the same way. 
I’m determined to give my kids a better childhood in every way.",25Apr2019,2

So when I was turning 18 my grandma ordered me my first passport for my 18th birthday present because it would mean I could go on holiday without having to worry about that (slightly deprived upbringing so never needed a passport, forever greatful for the best birthday present I’ve ever got because I go on loads of holidays now though) and my passport arrived... no middle name on it.

I’m feeling so blah. Nothing seems to be right and while nothing is truly “on fire”, I feel like things could be so much better. 

My job sucks but I can’t figure out what I like in order to get a job remotely close to that. The things I’m “passionate” about wouldn’t pay my bills. 

I’m in so much debt and it doesn’t seem to go away no matter how hard I work. 

I’m single af. Most of me is so repulsed by men currently and I couldn’t tell you why. There’s a small part of me that wants to date. But the few dates I’ve been on (few and far in between) have been with guys that I end up having no interest in after spending some time with them. 

I realize this all sounds super fucking whiny and first world problem-y. Again nothing truly is on fire but things just feel so blasé. I’m in a rut that I feel like I’ll never get out of. I feel like things won’t ever be better than this and I’ll never really amount to anything. 

I just feel like I’m nothing. And I’m pretty sure it just stems from me being indecisive af. Idk. Thanks if you read this.

It's just one of those days where we would wake up and it feels like everything is right. Ya get what I'm pointing? As of now, I am torn from going out and embracing the raging sun until I am a bread toasted for 7 minutes vs working on my paintings while listening to chill beats.

Anyway, the day is still long (kinda) and I will come up with something. Just wanna share some good vibes. Hope everybody is all good!",25Apr2019,1

36,"I'm getting a bit tired of hearing him complain about lazy our class is, how lazy our generation is, etc. I mean, he's not wrong - a lot of us (myself included) haven't tried hard enough in class. But it's getting redundant. And you can only hear so much about how lazy you are, how addicted to your phones you are, how sensitive you are, that it starts to give you a headache just thinking about it.

And I have tried harder. I've turned in my assignments, and completed them to the best of my ability. I've studied, and I've tried my best on tests and quizzes. So it's getting a bit annoying to keep hearing him complain about us, even if I'm not necessarily a part of the group he's complaining about.

I feel like I'm everything he criticizes about this generation, too. I'm lazy, I don't pay attention, I find it hard to accept reality, I'm sensitive, I'm stressed out all the time. Are those bad things? Yes. Do I need to hear about them every single day? No.

37,"I live in a studio. Last night I had the window open for a bit then I closed it before doing to sleep. Woke up early morning to very loud buzzing. At first I actually thought someone was mowing the grass outside near my window, but it kept going for so long I eventually got up to check, and what do I see? A giant wasp flying around my window from inside, the window right next to my bed! 

I'm terrified of bees and wasps. The first thing I did was to hide completely under the covers and make sure that not even a single hair could enter my hastily constructed blanket fort. I'm still there. The wasp is flying around. I can hear it and I'm terrified. I don't have anything to get rid of it with. I've been in a similar situation before but at night, so the solution was to make my room pretty dark and open the door to the lit corridor and the wasp would exit on its own. Now it's morning and I have to go to work soon but I am too scared to even move. I will be stuck here forever.",25Apr2019,1

Where are the men at. Like c’mon. Why not be fair and have some dudes lookin good every now and then? I want to balance out my intake of hot people so that I feel like there’s some hope out there...the guys I see represented most online are neckbeards and niceguys. If there’s 10 pics of someone in bikini, why can’t there also be a dude catching some waves? Why does it seem like no one’s attracted to guys when like half of the population actually is? I mean I’m just pointing out, you’d never see someone creep a picture of a guy’s ass at the mall and say “peep the nickel on the ground”. So we’re at a point where we think *that* is normal but I still don’t get a cute guy posing by some flowers or showing off his beach bod. That’s the equality I want. 

It’s annoying when people link obscure subreddits or insta handles that are half dead and with like five pictures of guys and say “look, but this exists”. Yeah, and nobody knows it because you have to dig under rocks for any content, whereas if you want to see pretty girls you just have to open any website. Appreciate men more!",25Apr2019,3
40,"ever since my mom was married to my dad, my grandmother would treat her differently. my mom came from a provincial place in the phillipines and city people (who are my fathers relatives) usually looked down upon provincial people. we, filipinos, have that toxic trait that when you're from rural area, you come as uneducated, poor, and so on. so her whole life after marriage, my mom felt like she was always belittled and always wronged. she used to be so patient about it until it got to so much. i feel for her. 

my dad on the other hand grew up in this traditional asian family with the mother side being toxic minded. my grandfather would be this good person while my grandmother would be this total bitch. even if my dad knows how wrong his mother can be, he would still love her no matter what. like i said, he knows its wrong, but he wouldnt know how it feels through my mother. so thats a problem. 

he also has anger issues. he stresses about his health, his work, that sometimes and he would bring it out on all of us. my mom would always think it was her fault for not having her own job to support us all or simply because shes not rich. they would always fight about it. my grandmother would also try to control her, say awful things to her, disrespect her because shes just a housewife, and even harass her infront of everyone. because of this bitchery it gets to mom. and she would always spat it into dad like they're the same person. which they are not. my dad cares about us, he just doesnt understand it. which i feel for but thats blind as fuck.

my grandmother would come in our house uninvited and try to clean our yard with her servants and tell everyone were treating her like a nanny or some shit. she would call us like shes dying or trying to kill herself just to make us do her chores and accompany her. she would be a total dick to everyone and once you ignore her, she would fake dying or fake being suicidal (lots of stories about it) or some shit it sucks. she does this whenever dads not around so he'll never truly feel her actions. so whenever we'd try to flee, dad would always tell us to keep wooing her like some goddamned idiot. so it stresses mom alot. 

so now they had a fight again. dad yelled because we were waiting outside the car and we didnt know he bumped into a sign and something cracked. he yelled because we didnt know and that pushed mom into thinking she was thought of an idiot again. mom ranted about the whole story while dad, being dumb, thought it was all about the car thing.

mom said shes leaving tomorrow. i just need help getting it out and some advice. i know its typical divorce things but it never gets easier no matter how many times it happens to people.",25Apr2019,2
41,"I just want to say, no I don’t OCD to the point where it takes over my life. I’m glad I don’t. My mother has a severe case of OCD and my father has a bit of OCD but not nearly as much as me and my mother. My mom has severe ADD, while my father has minor ADD. I inherited only OCD and my brother inherited severe ADHD. In a sense, I feel like I got way luckier gene wise than him which I do feel bad for cause I see how he struggles especially with his thinking. 

Anyway, here’s a list of what I’ve noticed about myself starting when I was a kid and some into adult hood. 

- As a child, I wouldn’t touch anyone else’s food on their plate. Normal, right? Of course that’s normal. It’s respectful. But I’m talking about when someone offered me their food, even if they haven’t touched it. So like a piece of pizza, wings, carrots or anything. I always thought that was disgusting. My parents noticed this about me at a very young age when they offered some of their food to me and I always rejected them. However, as I grew older, I grew out of that. In adulthood, I was more open to taking food off of people’s plates when it’s offered to me. So that one doesn’t bother me nearly as much anymore. 

- To this day, I absolutely FORBID food touching other food on my plate. When I grab food, I section it off on my plate so it won’t touch others. Putting spaces in between each food item. I’ve even joked about getting children’s plates that sections off areas for different foods. When I see food touch, I get disgusted. I then eat around the area of the food items touched and then throw it away later. My family jokes that it all goes in the same place, and I agree but something in my head tells me it can’t be that way. It also drives me crazy when I see them mix food together. 

- How my bed is made is something that has to be precise too. The pillows and blankets have to be on a certain way and in a certain order. This is something I still carry into adulthood but it started basically when I started making my own bed. No family or partners have complained about this though as the bed is always made and tidy. :P

- When I’m on the computer, certain things have to be certain ways. The icons on the desktop, the names of the folders/files, how clean the desktop looks or organized. Even the items in folders have to be a certain way. I noticed this in high school when I started using the computers there for computer science and ICT. In projects where I built video games, all my assets/folders/scripts had to be neatly in a folder. Even my coding in my video games had to be neat and clean. I know most people like to keep a clean and organized computer but mine was to the extreme. Whenever I used a family members computer or friends, it really bothered me to see how messy their desktop or folders were. To this day, I still carry that with me. 

- This one has to do with the gaming chat program called Discord. I’m a gamer so I use discord to chat with my friends. They’d invite me to their servers and stuff and how their server looked always bugged me. How it wasn’t organized, the text channels were messy, voice/chat channels weren’t labeled, people didn’t have roles in whether they’re mod/admin or whatever. How certain chats weren’t used for certain things etc. It always bothered me. To the point where I made my own server, organized it and invited all my friends to calm myself down. They all know about my OCD so they didn’t complain. :P

- This one has to do with gaming. If a game has challenges or achievements (which is most of them) I definitely HAVE TO get them all. I don’t even like challenges and achievements but if I see them there I have to get them done. I’ve been addicted to this battle royal called Ring of Elysium and it has new challenges every few days in each season and when they come out I grind to get them done in hopefully a day or two. Cause if it sits there and I know it’s not done, it bothers me so much. The game came out with new challenges today and I only have one or two left to complete because I’ve been playing all day. It sucks that I feel this way. This is the most annoying one to me. 

- Another that I do is organization of school work/work work. Certain things have to be written on papers in a certain, clean and organized way. Now my teachers loved this when I was in school lmao. My boss appreciates it too and so does my girlfriend. Funny thing is though, I didn’t give a damn about my binder being organized when I was in school. Hmmm. 

- I live in Canada and we get about 6 months of snow. Sometimes I leave my vehicle outside over night and it snows and then there’s a big blanket of snow covering my car. I’ll be late to whenever I’m going because I’ll literally spend half an hour cleaning every ounce of snow off my car before leaving because it bothers me. 

- Group projects was a hard one for me in school. I often did everything myself because (not to sound like a dick) I didn’t think my partners did good enough work. And when they did do something they were proud of, I just kept quiet and tried not to think about it. Because I didn’t want to bring someone down for something they were truly proud of. 

- I actually really hate the thought of needing to start cleaning my house or the dishes. Because I don’t want to. But once I start, I can’t stop. I get so much satisfaction with cleaning even though I really don’t want to. When you see the dirt or grime being wiped away so cleanly is just so satisfying. Vacuuming and heating the dirt and whatever else be sucked up is sooo satisfying. 

There’s are just a few things to name about my OCD and of course, perfectionism. It doesn’t affect my life in a big, dramatic way but it’s something I’ve noticed once finally brought to my attention. I don’t wish it to be gone because honestly in some ways, it’s helpful for me and it isn’t super obsessive for me but yeah. :)",25Apr2019,2
42,"This isn't a drug themed post as I'm not a big drug taker though I am definitely an enthusiast. My girlfriend's birthday was a couple of days ago and I was both excited and nervous for the party as her friends are a crazy bunch (good crazy) and I've been having trouble ""fitting in"" lately I guess. (we've been going out for like 10 months now). Anyway, the party is happening and all that and I'm having a good time and so is she so all is good. Until, in my head, they start talking about picking up some drugs for the night. Now as I'm not experienced enough I get a little nervous and start myself on a downer. My girlfriend is worrying about me at this point also but I'm assuring her I'm okay and tell her about the nerves. We reassure eachother and head to the next place which is in town in her mates house.

Long story short I ended up taking acid and some ketamine haha. I had a ""fuck it"" moment and realised if it's gonna be bad then let it be bad and just roll with it. Well, roll with it I did and jesus I was rolling my arse off. Now I'm not gonna be that guy spouting about my new found drug craze. For me it was such a positive experience. I was laughy and happy and of course there were things moving that don't normally move of their own accord. I was really enjoying that I wasnt ruining her birthday by being me sitting quietly in the corner. 

 I usually have a tough night out with her friends just cause I get quiet and a little anxious. But this night was really chill and I had some fun. I realised that everyone in the room cares about me in some way and on the other hand couldnt give a shit. Which was helpful to me at the time.

Also Im dying with a really bad cough I think may be a chest infection so I'm sitting out in the morning irish sun getting some air and  it waking the house up.

I hate waking up at 3am to poop.

I have 2 shifts every week that get me up at 3:30 am, and those are on Monday and Tuesday - rest of the week is smooth sailing where I can sleep until 6 am before I have to get up for work.

I have to wake up at 3am to poop. 

I used to drink coffee, like a lot of coffee. I'd drink half a pot a day, keep me going. Coffee gave me insane anxiety and caused several panic attacks before I quit it several weeks ago.

On the second day without caffeine, I puked. 

Every single day I have not had coffee, I wake up at 3am to poop. I haven't gotten back on coffee, even a little, to see if that fixes it because no more means no more.

Today I honestly thought I'd get back to sleep. False! Instead I laid in bed for an hour before deciding to get up. If my bowels are going to wake me up several hours before work I might as well wake up a bowl several hours before work am I right?",25Apr2019,5
46,"I feel like I shouldn't have to say this. We know it's not alright to call someone retarded or spastic or a ""downer"" and so on, but for some reason a lot of people still think it's fine to call someone autistic when they make a social faux pas or get over-emotional. Being pedantic doesn't make you autistic. Being a creep isnt ""autism level: 100"". It's really hurtful to autistic people to use their disability as a slur. It dehumanizes them. It turns them into a series of failings instead of someone with value.

Maybe this one has persisted longer than other ableist slurs because autism isn't 100 percent negative, and many autistic people prefer not to think of themselves as disabled but rather as neurodivergent (as opposed to neurotypical). There can be lots of great things about being autistic, like attention to detail and a unique perspective, extreme loyalty, strong passions for niche interests, and so on. But it has its negatives too, which most autistic people are painfully aware of, and they don't need to be reminded that society sees them as a whole as awkward, creepy, clumsy, incompetent, and the butt of every joke.

I probably won't change anyone's mind here, but I felt I had to say something because it feels like in every big comment thread I see ""autistic"" used as a slur and it rarely gets called out.",25Apr2019,84
47,"I confessed to a close that I have deep feelings for her about 4 months ago, and I feel like I did the right thing but I regret it at times. A little backstory, this girl and I have been good friends for about 6 years now. I never had any kind of affectionate feelings for her for the longest time, not until recently. We both left for college, currently a junior, and throughout my freshman year we talked almost every day. Even if it was for just a couple minutes, we still tried to keep in touch. As time went on, our relationship started to fade, as most do after spending a while apart and hardly ever seeing one another. Every so often one of us would say hi and see how the other was doing but even then we still lost touch after a while. About eight or so months go by and we haven’t talked to each other. At this point I’m at a really low point in my life and I  feel depressed, lonely, wondering what my purpose is in life and why I’m here (the usual bullshit we all go through sometime), and I really want to say something to her but I just can’t go through w it. Until one day I watched a film that really hit home about the choices we make in life and the different outcomes that lead to those choices, which got me to ask questions about the way I was living my life and how I can chose to try and be happy instead of moping around all day waiting for something to come my way. A few weeks go by and I’m already feeling so much better about myself, and I think about the people I want in my life and the people who I should stay away from. While thinking about her, I realized that she is a person that makes me really happy and makes me feel like I matter in this world, because anytime we’d talk or spend time together we’d make each other laugh, smile, and we could share anything with each other. Idk why it took me so long to realize she meant this much to me. Anyways, I finally get the courage to say something to her. I want to tell her that I miss her, tell her that she means a lot to me and how I’d love to stay in contact even if we go months without saying hi. I just want her to know that shes made an impact on my life. It’s a few days past Christmas and I figured I’d start a conversation asking how her holiday season has been, and the conversation goes really well. Time goes on and I basically said fuck it and thought I’d get everything off my chest because I figured if I don’t do it now, I’m never going to. I tell her how I’ve been in a slump lately and how I was thinking about the people that matter most to me, and that she is one of those people. I tell her I miss talking to her, seeing her, tell her how I miss the way things used to be, and overall just explain how I’d love to stay in touch because she’s a person I don’t want to lose in my life. She tells me the same things saying how she wants to stay in contact and try to make time for one another. It makes me happy to hear but being that we’re 3 hours apart from each other, i know it’s easier said then done. Four months have gone by and we’ve hardly had two conversations since then. I still feel a lot better than I did before and I know we both have our own lives and I know she’s busy with hers, and I know sometimes people grow apart and that’s just how it is. It just sucks when you can feel someone you care about slowly fading away. I want to say hi, but she has a boyfriend now and I feel like saying anything to her, even starting a friendly conversation wouldn’t do anything but make me miss her more and possibly even bother her because I know she’s probably doing well. And that’s all I want for her, just to be happy. Overall, I feel like I did the right thing by telling her how I feel, but every so often I wonder if things would be different if I’d just kept my mouth shut and had a catch up conversation instead of expressing all my feelings.

I know this is really long and tedious, but I don’t really have anyone to talk to about this sort of thing with and I just wanted to get all of this off my chest. Thanks for taking the time to read this, and if you have any kind of advice at all I’d be more than happy to hear it.",25Apr2019,2
48,"Tl;dr - Put my foot down on no contact with dad. Long, difficult talk with my mom who said she was hurt that we didn't get along. But I'm done.

...

I think I finally got my mom to (kind of) understand where I'm coming from. She said it hurt her that my dad and I can't get along. She felt she was in the middle and was trying to stay out of it. I told her that when some one is hurting some one else, staying neutral only hurts the victim more. She said we were both adults, but I countered with saying AGAIN it still wasnt equal. Told her it wasn't her fault for not knowing how much he damaged me...

I mean... it kinda is since she ignored our issues/took his side a lot. She told me endless times that she didn't want to hear about it. My pediatrician had to tell my mom I needed therapy. She complained about the cost of therapy every appointment she took me to. But whatever. I talked a little about how much he hurt me during my formative years and treated me like crap. That I didn't even want to see him. She still hopes I come around lmao.

Then she said that he is who he is, and I have to accept it. I told her that I have accepted it, that I was sorry she was hurt, but that I could choose not to be around him. That he has never tried to work on himself or admit anything. That he never tries to reconcile or ever, EVER apologize

She tried to claim that he is bad at that and doesn't reach out to anyone. It doesn't matter mom! I know if I wait for an apology, I'll waste my life. But he clearly doesn't want to have a relationship with me so I'm not going to deal with it. I'm DONE.

I told her AGAIN that HE CHOSE to destroy our relationship. That we have different ways to handle family - she can still love/interact with her brother who treated her badly for 9 years while she worked for him. Personally, I would have confronted him/quit the job/gone no contact for at least awhile. I'm not like her at all. That's something she has always struggled with and something that has prevented her from understanding my perspective. She accepts her brother as he is. And I accept my dad the way he is.

Thanks to anyone who read this far.",25Apr2019,7
49,"Anyone who is currently serving, or has already served time as a felon, should already be allowed to exercise their Constitutional right to vote.

In the U.S., there is this prevailing thought that the 2nd Clause, of Section 2, of the 14th Amendment, grants States the rights to revoke and even determine the basis of, the voting rights of current and former felons. 

Here is the 14th Amendment:

&gt; Representatives shall be apportioned
&gt; among the several States according to
&gt; their respective numbers, counting the
&gt; whole number of persons in each State,
&gt; excluding Indians not taxed. But when
&gt; the right to vote at any election for the
&gt; choice of electors for President and
&gt; Vice-President of the United States,
&gt; Representatives in Congress, the
&gt; Executive and Judicial officers of a
&gt; State, or the members of the
&gt; Legislature thereof, is denied to any of
&gt; the male inhabitants of such State,
&gt; being twenty-one years of age, and
&gt; citizens of the United States, or in any
&gt; way abridged, except for participation in
&gt; rebellion, or other crime, the basis of
&gt; representation therein shall be reduced
&gt; in the proportion which the number of
&gt; such male citizens shall bear to the
&gt; whole number of male citizens
&gt; twenty-one years of age in such State.

****

Upon an initial reading of this amendment, it could be assumed that there is a justification that allows a State to revoke a felon's right to vote.

Let's break it down a bit:

The first clause of this amendment, sets a standard method to calculating the proper number of Representatives that a State will be entitled to, based off of the number of males who are at least 21 years in age, meeting the voting age requirement. 

The opening of this clause names the electable offices for which an elector can cast their vote for a suitable candidate. 

The middle of this clause addresses a special issue that may arise, where qualified, male voters in a State, are being denied the right to vote. The target group that this applies to, are male Inhabitants that are both:

* Age 21 
* U.S. Citizen, or equivalent by ""abridgement""

 ""Abridging"", is a formal way of referencing an expedited means of gaining citizenship. Known examples of this type of citizenship are commonly granted to those who are either, automatically born on U.S. soil, or serve a term in the military. 

This clause also appends two other minor determining conditions to this expedited citizenship process, in order to qualify a male Inhabitant as a voter: Rebellion, and other crimes.

A qualified male Inhabitant, must be one who also doesn't engage in acts of rebellion against the U.S., or in other crimes, like illegal entry, in order to gain Inhabitant status illegally. Committing these acts are the actual grounds for disqualifying a male of voting age, from qualifying as an Inhabitant that can vote in any election. 

The remainder of this clause calls for an adjustment in Representation, in proportion to the number of qualified male voters, voting in any election. This is based upon the number of qualified male voting Inhabitants, multiplied by the basic enumeration standards from Article 1, Section 2, Clause 4 of the U.S.. Constitution.

****

In conclusion, we now have a clear understanding of what the 14th Amendment is about. The 14th Amendment sets the amount of representatives that a State can have, based upon the number of qualified, male Inhabitants there are. In order to disqualify a male Inhabitant from voting in an election, they would have to obtain their residency status illegally, through ""other crimes"", like illegal entry. Engaging in rebellion against the U.S., qualifies as another ground upon which a male voter of voting age, can be legally denied the right to vote. The grounds for denying a felon the right to vote don't and have never existed at all, in the U.S. Constitution. All of this time, any State that has engaged in such a way to deprive a felon of their right to vote, has unknowingly committed an offense to a felon's right to vote, without determining whether or not such grounds were justified because of either, illegal entry or rebellion against the U.S..

We also have to consider what has been discoved by this newer examination of the 14th Amendment, and relate it the any other voting-related Amendments. Now, we have a better standard for determining the voting rights of felons: Any former or current felons who are at least 18 years in age, can rightfully vote in any election, provided that they have not engaged in any acts of rebellion against the U.S., or haven't obtained their residency status by any illegal means.

As a quick remedy for now, until Congress creates a proper, sweeping resolution to address this issue, each State can create their means of immediately restoring a felon's right to vote. Each one should see no further, limiting conditions to be met in order to qualify to vote in any election, provided that said felon hasn't engage in any known acts of rebellion against the U.S. or is living there by any means of illegal entry.",25Apr2019,1

52,"I have been using this doorway alert security module to tell me when someone walks into an area. It uses a motion detecting module that sends a signal to the base unit... and then the base unit lights up and makes a noise that I can hear. 

It is a common thing a lot of shops use to tell the shopworker in the back when a customer comes in. 

Well, anyway there is a limit to how far they can communicate with each other. And I am often quite far away from the base unit. 

So... I figured I'd use some serious walkie talkies to extend the alert function. WHat I did was place one walkie talkie next to the base unit with the push-to-talk button held down and then carries the other walkie talkie with me.  So that when the base unit sounded I would hear it on my walkie talkie. 

But something odd was happening when I went to test it. The base unit was not sounding when I walked in front of the motion detecting module. 

Turns out the walkie talkies were completely interfering with it. Completely overpowering the airwaves or something (hell if I know), because when I turned the walkie talkies off the motion detecting module would work fine. 

Back to the drawing board to figure out something new.",25Apr2019,6

They stride forward towards themselves in great leaps and bounds. Their lives are inward explosions of self-perpetuating momentum. Meanwhile, the others bathe. Not to be discounted or avoided. However, simply know that you are bathing for the purpose of cleansing. You focus throughout the day and give every moment your full attention. You don't decide how each day flows and where it takes you so you must clean your body in preparedness of each new cycle. Your mind is full too so empty it and let it wander for a moment.

57,"I’m naturally very open with the way I talk and converse with others. So today my friend and I were talking about our assignments that were going to be due in less than two weeks. Our progress has been slow and the motivation for the both of us recently is lacking. She shared about how demotivating it was to put in a lot of hardwork when there are people who do these assignments at the last minute can score much higher. I related in that statement (context: we’re both hardworkers) and shared with her that sometimes I get bitter and envious too,  knowing these individuals often get extra help from seniors and connections that they have. Afterwards, I was talking about how the mutual friend we have is one of those that are pretty chill about their work and end up performing really well. I continued saying that sometimes I wondered how she makes it work and what’s her mechanism in a way that perhaps may come off aggressive though I don’t mean to. I don’t know if my friend will take that negatively, I wonder if I am I overthinking. 

I care for both of these two girls that I wonder being that candid towards the friend I shared with might ruin her perception of my relation with our other friend. Like I see her as my competition or something. I mean I only want to do my best for everything, but if I can at least do as well as my friend who isn’t grinding as much as I am, then I would feel more assured of my capabilities.

64,"I'm probably a bit of an underachiever. Or not. I dunno anymore. And that's part of the problem: It all feels the same. 

I was broke and doing 'nothing' once. This was apparently very bad. At one point I went back to college and got another degree. ""Good job, what a change!"" Really? Ok. I didn't feel it. To me, just was like: One day, I decided I wanted to go back to school, so I did, I sat in some classes, did a little minimal studying and work, and there ya go. Wasn't that hard. There was a disconnect between what others saw as previous 'doing nothing' me, and now 'praiseworthy' me.

Same thing with work. I was pretty much broke for a bit, and now I'm not. I'm not rich or anything, but I make money doing some stuff which, again, is not really hard, nor does it seem like some super-important thing I do. Yet it makes such a different in outward perception. But not inward perception. I didn't change, it's just that now I do this thing sometimes. It's good, because it keeps me from getting bored and floating without structure, but other than that, it's not much of an accomplishment to me.

Same with losing weight. I have zero desire to ever post the before/after pics, and get the requisite internet praise. Not that I'm at the 'after' yet at all, but again, when I'm doing things supposedly right, I don't feel it. It's more like, ""So...I'm doing personal training sessions and eating less. Kinda interesting how it feels, like I'm more reved up during the day. And the training sessions are kinda interesting...but that's just some dude telling me to lift weights and me listening. Is this really the pinnacle of human achievement? Anyone can do this, I'm not even doing it myself, just listening to someone else!""

And the things I DO feel are worth praise...no one gives much of a shit about. I was originally a music major, and I've spent a lot of time developing my musical taste and understanding. But no one cares. During piano practice I also sometimes hear myself in the zone, and think, ""Wow, that was *really* good. I don't hear other pianists doing it that well. I think that's quite something."" 

But you never get any great reaction from people in your life for that stuff. They just think it's such an amazing super change that now you have a blah job any number of people could do...well okay. My brain doesn't get it.

I think it's that I feel like my IDEAS are what's great about me. Like, so far beyond the other pedestrian life shit it's not even funny. I go to social gatherings and listen to other people, and hear how almost no one's brain is working like mine is. I look at society, and see some things that aren't being said by people, and think those things are incredibly useful and worth hearing. But at most, that makes me just another random dude spouting his opinions on reddit, and getting 2 upvotes, or some self-indulgent Youtuber with 500 hits. Feels wrong. 

So, here I am, trying to get my life 'right'. Also, trying to attract women. And women, too, seem to like the pedestrian stuff more. It makes me angry sometimes, and is also a turn-off. I dunno...my internal calibrations are somehow not set right for achievement in this world.",25Apr2019,3

I must have a slight lisp or something, because I have trouble with the J sound at the beginning and am always repeating myself when I am trying to introduce myself. Add to that, no matter where I go or what I am doing there is ALWAYS at least one other Jessica, or even more. My SIL is even a Jessica. I thought about legally changing it to my middle name.

So here is the dilemma. Even if I rename myself like I plan to, no one will call me by it unless it is similar and easy for them to remember. My only other nickname has been ""bessie"" yep... There is no way I want to go by that either. Although at this point at least it isn't the same as the 10 other Jessicas.

78,"  The other day I was reminiscing about my youth growing up in New York. My family immigrated to the States shortly after I was born. Setting foot in a strange new city with no real sense direction, my parents somehow managed to raise my brother and me. Growing up I had always known my family was poor. I never paid it any mind. In fact, my younger self took pride in growing up in the hardships we faced. That line of thinking may have been ingrained on me by my parents.


  But comparing our living conditions for the first 10 years to now, I just realized how poor we really were. Shortly after arriving to the ‘Big Apple’, my parents had found a basement to rent. My Father found a job at a Construction company as an unofficial mechanic. Which essentially means he had all the responsibilities of a mechanic only without the pay. 


  Some of my earliest memories now seem so strange in retrospective. Anyone who has experienced a Winter in New York knows when it’s cold…it’s COLD! The basement we rented did not have any heat and most rooms were poorly insulated. In an effort to stay warm, we would drag two mattresses into the kitchen and lay them on the floor. With an electric heater aimed at the makeshift bed, we spent the Winter nights sleeping together on the kitchen floor. Not to mention wandering rats that would try to get in on the action. I remember worms crawling up the drain when taking a shower, and I remember staying up late waiting for my Father to come home from work. 


  Speaking of my father, I vividly remember a night where my Father came home with the tip of his index finger barely hanging on to the rest of his hand. Apparently, an accident had happened at work, and they refused to call the ambulance and sent him home with no medical assistance. Being poor my father didn’t want to a face an expensive medical bill and decided, like the man he was, to sew it back together again. The only problem was he could hold the tip of the finger to the rest of it. My mother being in shock couldn’t do it, so he had asked my brother to hold it while he sewed it back together. Looking back at it now, plenty could have gone wrong. But thankfully this haphazard medical fix surprisingly worked. Years later, his finger is fine except for the loss of feeling at the tip. As with most people, my Father is the prototypical ideal of a man I aspire to be. I am forever thankful for the hardships my father has gone through to support our family. 


  For all the hardships we faced growing up, I feel it has made our family closer on an emotional and spiritual level. While these are strange memories to have they are what my family and I have bonded over. We may have not been well off financially, but the lessons my parents thought me vicariously through them raising my brother and I will have an enduring impact on me.",25Apr2019,107
79,"So there is this annoying thing that i cannot get out of my head. I don't have confidence and i don't trust myself. Why is that you ask ? It is because i am afraid to...
When i look at all these people in the world who have such insane horrible ideas and beliefs like anti-vaxxers and pretty much any person on r/insanepeoplefacebook what i always notice is that all of them have very strong confidence in what they are doing ...they trust themselves and they don't doubt their beliefs and they consider everyone who critisezes them a ""hater"".

In short they are deluded. And i am afraid of confidence and loving myself because i am afraid of slowly slipping into delusion and basically afraid of having the same mentality of deluded people.

82,"On this day, seven years ago, I tried taking my own life. Thanks to the love and support of the amazing people around me, and the strength I've bolstered from within, I am still alive today.

On and off for the last decade I have struggled with depression. It seems that every three years my life fell apart. A cycle which started back in highschool. I was considering suicide in 2009, but then it turned around when I fell for someone I thought was special. The relationship lasted a while, but inevitably failed, and in 2012 I  actually attempted suicide. Obviously, I survived, and I very slowly moved on and found reasons to live. Friends and family being the most prominent of those. Then, in 2015, once again my life crumbled as three members of my family all passed away, including my father. That became the worst year yet, but I found a way to push forward. Later that year, I fell head over heels in love with the love of my life. Everything felt like it was finally getting better, but then the cycle struck me one more time. Last year, I suffered the worst year of my entire life. Our relationship fell apart, and I was forced to face the only imagineable Hell I've ever known.

This year I am taking a stand, and I've been fighting back. I've said it before, but for the first time in the last decade I genuinely enjoy life. The happiest moments of my life happened in the last few years, but I've never felt as genuinely healthy and just generally well as I do now. I'm on the cusp of happiness, finally, and I have never felt this sort of balance before. Thought I'm still struggling, I am proud to have the amazing support system I have in all of you. With much thanks to my friends, family, and loved ones, I can finally see myself becoming the best iteration of myself ever. Some day soon, I hope my stars will align.

With a heart so massive and pure as gold, I live to share it with everyone. To anyone I've ever hurt, I'm truly sorry, but please know that I am still becoming a better person, and have room to grow. I am loved, and I love all of you with all of my heart. To all of you who have stood by me and supported me through the years...thank you. ❤️",25Apr2019,4

Llevo muchos años sintiéndome como un fantasma con una tristeza profunda a la que le debo hacer frente todos los días y estoy cansada. 
Hace poco mi novio me dijo que no me ama y por más que lo volvemos a intentar yo lo hago sentir mal por mi forma de ser y él se aleja cada vez más de mí. 
Perdí a nuestra bebé por mi culpa por estar enferma de NF1 y tener tumores en la matriz.
Me gusta ayudar a otros pero de un tiempo para acá me considero solo un problema y un estorbo . No creo ser útil para nade y solo empeoro todo. 
Las personas que me conocen me aprecian menos las personas que realmente amo. 
En mi cabeza solo pienso que todo estaría mejor sin mí 
Tengo una hija de 4 años a la que amo con todo mi ser. Me cuesta trabajo maternar con tanto dolor en mi alma. Odio que me vea siempre llorando y enferma. No soy el ejemplo que deseo para ella, soy una mierda de persona. Creo que sería más feliz viviendo con su papá a tener que vivir en la prisión de mi depresión . Nunca la llevo al parque porque me duele todo el cuerpo. No juego con ella solo quiero dormir. Y por más que hago un esfuerzo se que no la hago feliz. Le doy mucho cariño, le cuento cuentos y dibujo con ella, bailamos juntas y le enseño canciones. Solo creo que soy un asco de madre y no soy suficiente. 
Mi novio.... Ex novio me dice que es más feliz sin mí. Y esa es la verdad que ilumina mis decisiones. Realmente creo que todos serían más felices sin mí.
No aporto nada bueno al mundo. Al contrario lo intoxico con mi tristeza y mi enojo. 
No puedo mantener a mi hija. Mis gastos me rebasan. No tengo ni para ir al doctor. Hace dos noches tuve fiebre por una infección en vías urinarias, algunos me han dicho que vaya al médico pero no tengo dinero para pagar la consulta y las medicinas. 
Y ahora menos, ya que mi pareja solía apoyarme con un poco de dinero. 
Así que lo oculto, digo que mejoraré pero en realidad no tiene caso para mí ya nada tiene caso.

Hace una semana mi nov... Ex novio me había invitado al cine para la ver Avengers era una salida en grupo. Hoy me dijo que ya no quiere saber nada mí y me bloqueó. Asumo que me desinvitó. Había pedido al papá de mi hija si podía pasar la noche con él para yo ir al cine, accedió. Ahora que sé que no iré y tendré la noche disponible. 
Nadie me llamará ni me buscará. Mucho menos mi ex. Podrían pasar años o una vida antes de que me recuerde. 
Mi madre no me habla, mi hermana estará ocupada con sus asuntos. 
Y creo que realmente llegó momento. Estoy harta de vivir sintiéndome basura. Todos estarán mejor así

88,"I'm in the interview process for a new job and I was worried since I last smoked (weed) a little less than two weeks ago. I just passed a take home drug test so I think I'm good. I trust the results since I didn't smoke regularly. This opened up an ethical dilemma for me since I was seriously considering cheating the drug test if I failed the take home.

&amp;#x200B;

I think it's wrong to lie, but I was already planning on quitting and I see no real victim here. I believe an employer has every right to drug test their employees just as I have the right to choose what company I work. When I really think about it I see it as a violation of a contract and morally wrong to cheat, but it seems so convenient and innocent that I probably wouldn't feel guilty for cheating.

89,"It's almost 9 pm and I am thinking, when I have my last sad walk. A sad walk is when I am feeling sad or weird, so I take a walk, not to cheer myself up, but to let it out. 

I didn't come up with the name myself. It was last year, when I was on a walk and I came back home, it was probably after midnight, I walked past my parents bedroom and heard my dad ask where I am. My mom just said that I'm probably on one of sad walks again.

I didn't even realize until then, that that's what they are. I just thought I liked taking walks in the night (I live on the countryside, not a really dangerous area).

90,"I dropped out of my first university in 2007. Hopped around a couple different states taking CC classes here and there. 

I didn’t have a car back in 2014, was living in a state that was unfamiliar to me, no friends, no family. Waiting at the bus stop in the pouring rain to take an hour and a half bus ride uptown to an algebra class. My pants were dragging on the ground from the rain, feet drenched, cold as hell.. but determined. 

The year I got accepted to a university, I got hit by a car. I was okay, but a dislocated shoulder put me on painkillers for a couple days. My boyfriend at the time would steal them when I wasn’t looking or pressure me into giving him some. 

He was toxic to me. I broke up with him that year and he had a new girlfriend before I moved out. I wasn’t okay. I fell into the darkest depression I’ve ever been in. A few months later my friend was killed in the Brussels bombing. A few months after that another friend died. Overdose, even though he tried *so hard* to conquer his addiction. It broke me even more than I already was. Continued spiraling down and out of control. I won’t go into it. 

I drank myself to sleep a lot. I was hospitalized. Suicide attempts, just really didn’t want to live anymore, but something wouldn’t let me die. 

I failed a lot of classes that year... but something kept me holding on. I decided to get a grip and start living for myself and climbed out of the grave I’d begun to dig for myself. *I did it.* I’m alive.

I spent most of my savings to get the necessary certifications/medical exams for a job that looked great on a program application. 
The job required you to pass specific written and physical exams.

I studied, I failed, and I used up all the attempts to pass the exam. Pretty angry at myself. I now have to reapply (spend more money) to retake the exam.

102,"Today I learned about Hedonic treadmill theory - which is the tendency of a person to remain at a relatively stable level of happiness despite changes in fortune or the achievement of major goals. As a person makes more money, expectations and desires rise in tandem, which results in no permanent gain in happiness.

This made sense, but also made me incredibly sad (which is pretty ironic since according to this theory I should get over it). I've been fluctuating between being depressed to just being unhappy for a long time now and I'm starting to wonder if that is my ""baseline happiness"". It makes me a bit hopeless, makes me feel that whatever I do to try improving my happiness (which is what I'm actively doing right now and I'm making a bit of progress) it's not going to work and is going to knock me back to my ""baseline happiness"" which is being unhappy.

This makes me feel as if chasing my goals is pointless. I know that's a bit irrational but that's what having diagnosed health anxiety does to me, I'm afraid I will never get out of this situation.

I don’t even know if I’d be satisfied if the actor for this character were to appear in front of me and ask me on a date. Because I’m not in love with the actor even; it’s the character that he plays.  Just everything about this character is perfect (obviously, since he’s been constructed by an entertainment industry)  but it’s like no guy that I meet in real life will ever be able to measure up to this guy.  Also the actor is a little older now than he was when he made the show and i like his younger self. So it’s like this version of him that doesn’t’ fully exist anymore anyway. Its really weird.

104,"I seem to have tweaked my lower back pretty badly today from twisting and I'm really worried that it could be a disc relating thing.  I feel like I might be overreacting since it's only been a couple of hours but I don't really have anyone to talk to about it right now and the internet seems to be all over the place with info about this type of thing.  I'm only 22 if that matters at all.

So I woke up this morning feeling pretty good, sat at my desk for a couple hours in the morning, then went to take a shower.  I leaned over my bed to grab a phone charger right before and when I stood up felt an extremely intense pain in my lower back.  I'm not even really sure what the movement was, a bit of a twist/stretch to reach it, and I didn't really realize how bad it was until a few minutes later when it was still just as bad

I used to work in a warehouse so I'm no stranger to some slight pulled muscles from lifting, but this is wayyyyy worse than anything I've felt before.  It really hurts to walk unless I walk at an odd angle which helps a bit.  Sitting with an ice pack on the area it seems to help a bit but still very difficult to get comfortable. 

Any ideas about this?  I feel like going to the doctor today wouldn't be the best idea cause it might just be a muscle thing but I'm not sure.  I would normally talk to my mom about this type of thing cos she is very reasonable when it comes to injuries like this but she is on vacation and I don't want to bother her. 

The other thing I'm really freaking out about is that I'm supposed to be finding a summer job right now and I was pretty set on getting a general labor/landscaping job because they don't require much experience and I can't afford not to work this summer but I guess it's too early to tell if this is gonna be a problem.

106,"Let me set up the situation so you guys can better understand everything 

So he’s my situation currently live with my brother and we both share a house and at first it was me and him at the house and split everything half and half (and to this day all bills are still split in half) this was January 2016. Me and my brother are extremely close it’s why we decided to move out of our parents together and get a place together. February of that year he met someone and she was amazing so kind and everything and makes my brother so happy which of course makes me happy. Later in that year   she moved in and in February 2017 they married. They both have children from different marriages. 

Here’s the situation she is extremely religious (a Christian through and through) and I have no issues with that have a ton of friends who are religious and they are great people ( I am personally an atheist) and my brother really didn’t have a religion. Ever since they became a couple my brother is getting more and more Christian to the point me is preaching and all that. 

I am a gay man of course my brother knows and his wife also knows (the kids don’t they are only 4) so she told me straight out she loves me no matter what but of course she thinks the things I do is against God and Jesus and does not condone the sins that I do. I also have a ton of friends in the LGBTQ including gay, lesbians , non binary and trans and here lies the issues 

Before I was able to have people over no issues at all when it was just me and my bro. But ever since she moved in and they got married i can not have my friends be around the kids because it will taint them and they are to young to know what gay or trans are and she will only call them by their birth gender not the gender they identify with because god created people with the gender they are born with and that’s it you are a boy or girl that’s it (her words) so pretty much if I was to have people over she and the kids have to leave the house ( the last time this happened she caused a huge issue and now I can’t have people over anymore without her causing a huge issue) and I can’t have boyfriends over either because of course can’t have gay around the kids 

So lately I’ve been thinking of moving out on my own and get away from this house but he’s the dilemma

The other reason me and my bro moved out was to make sure we help each other financially since me and him cover half of everything me leaving meaning he will have to cover it all which he is not able to do

She is not able to help because her kids father left and moved to another country no peep no nothing so daycare, food, health, bills everything of hers she takes care of herself and her current job doesn’t pay a lot so all her money goes towards her bills 

So my issue is I don’t want to leave my bro like that because me and him are so extremely close and been for many years and I’m afraid of hurting him but the current living situation is extremely toxic and I don’t think I can handle this anymore mentally 

But I don’t want to screw over my brother and my nephews either it’s like I don’t know I want to do this by the end of the year but not sure if he will be ready by then ugh I don’t know

108,"I talk a lot, it’s a thing, this is probably WAY longer than it needs to be, read if you want, or don’t, I won’t blame you.

So my old AD was a big, hot headed asshole. It’s my Junior year of high school, and all 3 years I’ve had him I hated him. He always acted like he was better than everyone else and he ran the team off of fear. I believe an AD has to be intimidating, but you shouldn’t run the football team like a military camp. I should be able to enjoy myself, because if not then why am I playing football? I don’t have a future on football, so why am I here if I feel miserable everyday? Why am I here for any other reason then, as cheesy as it sounds, to have fun? Well, in my case, it was because my family told me to stay in football. It was both family pressure and peer pressure that kept me in. But when your own players are too scared to talk to you, you’re probably doing something wrong. I could never enjoy myself on the field, because I was too scared about messing up and getting chewed out. And not even during games, but in everything everyday. Drills, I was too scared of messing up to actually focus on improving. I was busy just trying to do it right and survive rather than doing it to the best of my ability. Of course, he did have people who liked him. Those were the kids who were actually good at football. He picked favorites, as most coaches do, but not based on character. He picked favorites based on skill. If you were a good person who worked hard everyday, but you sucked at athletics, he’d belittle you and treat you like dirt.

Now that I’m done ranting about my not so favorite AD, a few weeks ago he told us he wasn’t going to be here next year. Probably found a much better paying job (since our school is so poor) and I don’t blame him for taking it. He has a family to provide for, and where he’s going he’ll probably get paid the same as a regular coaching staff as he does here as an AD, and it’s possible his wife got a teaching job there too, so it’s just a much better opportunity for his family. Now I’ll admit, I was sad to hear this news. As much as I hated this man, he was my coach. He was like family, just a hated family member, but still family. But after days went on, I became more and more excited for the new AD

The new AD shows up after a couple of weeks, and so far I really like him. He’s nice, he seems to actually care about his players and his players’ joy and love for the game more so than he does about winning. I mean, every coach should care about winning, but not to the point to where your players’ happiness is suffering, because if I’m not enjoying myself, why am I even playing? And he just seems like a really cool guy. We’re going to the old school that he used to work at for a linemen challenge May 4th. Its five dollars, and guess what? He’s paying out of his own pocket for all of us going. And going is even optional. And he says he doesn’t care if we do great or not, he just wants to show off his linemen and watch us compete. This is a total 180 from my last AD. He’s even bringing us donuts the morning of, so that’s a plus. And I wasn’t sure who was all going to the linemen challenge, and he said he was going to give us a day to think about it and then everyone who wanted to go would raise their hand. Not wanting to go if all my friends weren’t going, I spent all the previous periods that day trying to think of an excuse. Guess what? Athletics rolls around, “Who wants to go?” some people raise their hand, and all he does is count how many are going and doesn’t even question or judge the people who are not. Something my old AD wouldn’t have done. I didn’t even need to stress about coming up with an excuse. So one of my friends was saying that he will go is he can just get off work. So I come up with the genius idea to tell him that my family was going to visit my brother (who lives 5 hours away) that weekend, spend the night and all that, and so I wouldn’t be able to make it as of now, but I will talk to my parents about skipping the trip since I’ve gone to see my brother many times, and then give him a definite answer when I find out. And this whole story is made up, but it works perfectly. Just tell him as soon as my friend is able to get that day off that I’ll be able to go, and if my friend can’t get off work, I can’t go. The problem is, like a beaten dog from my last coach, I was scared to talk to my AD. I spent 10 minutes outside the door of his office trying to tell him this made of story, scared of anger and judgment and everything else my old AD would have given me. I finally get the courage to walk into his office, and all friendly he says

AD: what’s up?

Me: hey coach. So, May 3rd my family is leaving to go visit my brother in (insert city name) and we won’t be back until May 5th.

He kind of smiles understandingly like he understands where this is going but he always understands that there’s nothing to be done (my old AD wasn’t very understanding of anything, so this was a big deal to me). He says: ah, so you won’t be able to go to the linemen challenge

Me: buuuut here’s the thing. I’ve seen my brother many times, I’ve been to (insert city name) many times, I’d much rather do the linemen challenge.

AD: *laughs* I don’t blame you

Me: so I’m going to check in with my parents, talk to them, and see if I can just stay home alone that weekend

He kinda chuckles and says: yea, and you can even give them the ol “he’s a new coach and I have to impress him” talk!

I kinda laughed and said: yea! Exactly! So I’ll just let you know if I can or not.

He shook my hand and said: no problem

And the funny thing is, I don’t even think he knows my name yet. I was too nervous that I forgot to introduce myself. And nervous for what? I was nervous because of how my old AD treated me, and I’m still mentally recovering from it. He just seems so cool, it’s a complete turn around from my old AD. I feel like I’ll actually enjoy football for the first time, and how fitting, during my senior year too. This is just something I’m really excited about, thought I’d share it.",25Apr2019,3

113,"So a little backstory - We we’re forced to move out by my parents and around the same time that happened, my “friend” needed someone to help her with her place since her boyfriend had lied (not the first time) about having a job. So we moved in and we started splitting rent and utilities and stuff. We’ve had a few problems in the past, and for more details, you’d have to look at a post I made a while back. Just check my profile for that.

Okay fast forward to today. Last week me and my boyfriend went to a con to enjoy ourselves (this was my birthday present), and she texted me asking for extra money for garbage. This isn’t the issue. In fact, I wouldn’t mind paying if she’d actually work (will explain shortly). I grew tired of the complaining. Me and my boyfriend even made the comment that she’s starting to complain every week instead of every month like she use to. Well, I think what set her off was the fact that me and my bf were only paying $520 total this month due to rent being $895 and the fact we are trying to move out in August. That leaves her paying $375 plus her utilities for the month. I stopped paying utilities because every time we take a bath, she bitches, or every time we use the garbage or cook, she bitches, so me and my bf have to take showers rarely and use my moms stuff at her house. Heck, we don’t even have a washer and dryer. 

So, I finally put my foot down and told her to take us off. That I’m done with her complaining. She complains about my cats, she complains about me “not cleaning up” (which is funny considering her bf praised me for doing my own dishes), and complains about money. This is where I draw the line. Her bf rarely works from what I seen. Even said he works hours like 4-8. And what does she do? Takes two days off when she already has weekends off! So she works like 3-4 days max. And considering they buy cigarettes like crazy and weed, it’s no wonder she’s broke. But, for someone who has so much like child support every week, two people “working”, and food stamps, PLUS me and my bf pitching in, why is she complaining?! She’s got the fucking high life. I think she’s only bitching because she wants more money from us, but I refuse considering she gives her son a bath every time he shits and leaves lights and TVs on all the time. Not my problem, ESPECIALLY when I’m rarely there.",25Apr2019,2
114,"This is hella personal and my unique experience, and in no way meant to sway people to believe anything. If you even see this, please be kind. 


I realized today how much my last relationship really fucked me up. 
They were stubborn. They were  direct. They were faithful. They didn’t assault me or cheat on me. So they was amazing. 

Little by little they took control. It started with things as simple as, “That show is dumb, let’s watch this.” Or “That restaurant sucks, let’s go there.” Which eventually turned into, “I don’t care if you’re uncomfortable with my drinking.” Or “I don’t remember throwing things at you, you must be gaslighting me.” 

I’ve been in therapy working through trauma sustained through surviving my first assault at 15, when I lost my virginity, and surviving a sexually abusive relationship when I was 17. I was still recovering at 21 when I met this partner. But this one didn’t force me to have sex with them. So they were good. 

I’ve learned SO much since then. So much. 

But today, as I’m dating someone who truly sees me, someone who wants me to open up and say what I want, I realized how little power I had in all of those relationships. 

I’m uncomfortable voicing to my new partner, that their one on one time with their coworker makes me uneasy. 

Is it my insecurities? Probably. 
Is it still a valid response? Absolutely. 

But as I canceled plans to sulk, in this emotionally overwhelming realization of just how controlled I was in my last relationship, I found gratitude. 

Gratitude that this emotional response, while overwhelmingly strong, wasn’t due to someone telling me they didn’t want me, or that my wants and desires didn’t matter. It was because I was afraid of the same patterns repeating themselves. That someone wouldn’t want me. 

It’s not an unreasonable boundary for me to set, or to at least express my discomfort. What is unreasonable, is for me to not express it, and to have it boil over three days from now and become something bigger than it is. 

Here’s to self improvement. And to not surrounding myself with toxic abusive people anymore. 


Also, anyone know how to be brave? Anyone know how to tell someone that they’ve been dating about past traumatic experiences without overwhelming the partner?
