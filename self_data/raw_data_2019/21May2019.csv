1,"Hi all! I apologize in advance for the wall of text. As the post says, I’m curious how some of you have finally found happiness and joy within yourself? 

I’ve been struggling with struggling with bad anxiety and panic attacks that come in waves. It’s bad bad for about a year now. In that time I also because somewhat depressed after I lost a job and relationship. While a lot has happened to me, I know there was a large portion that my negative mindset was making worse.

Through this journey of coming back to my faith (Christian) and going to counseling and meditating and reflecting a bit, I’ve had some thought pop into my head. Mostly I have realized that most/all of my of my life I have looked to external factors for happiness. I have always been the funny guy who was great at sports, had lots of friends, motivated to achieve, and truthfully always pretty much got what I wanted in life.

In a weird way I’m happy to be going through this now in this point of my life and truly believe I will come out a stronger person on the other side of this. So with all this said, how have you all found inner peace and joy within yourself?",21May2019,2

3,I just finished my first year of college. I was busy all the time and I liked that bc it gave me something to be doing/working towards. Today I just took my last final and I’m relieved it’s over but also I feel so empty?? Idk how to spend my time rn and I’m already working but it doesn’t take up as much time. My mental health is shit whenever I have too much time to myself. Any advice/ anyone see where I’m coming from?,21May2019,1
4,"My(19f) brother (18) is ruining our family slowly. I’m pretty sure he’s addicted to drugs, he got expelled from school 2 months ago (they’re letting him complete assignments over email though), he doesn’t do anything at home (let alone said assignments), and goes out with his friends till 4 am. Oh wait did I mention he’s probably gonna get fired from his job for calling in absent the last 2 weeks? 

Anyways, I told our mom I’m done doing anything for my brother. He’s ungrateful, inconsiderate, and he literally doesn’t do anything. 

I’m upstairs in my room and I just heard my mom tell her friend that she’s completely sick of him and his BS, and especially because he won’t leave me alone (because he keeps asking me for money and to buy him weed or alcohol). I’m basically the poster girl for golden child. Almost a 3.0 GPA, I work 3-4 days a week plus I do all the chores, give our cousins rides, on top of going into my third year in university. 

My mom finally said that she’s so upset by my brothers actions that she’s worried that I’m going to be so fed up that I’ll move out.

Tbh that was sort of my plan that began to develop the last few days. My friend asked me a week or so ago if I wanted to move out with her and I said I’d think about it. 

I’m not sure what to do. If I move out and my mom has to live with him, he’s probably cause her a heart attack or stroke (she’s 50 and already has some health problems). If I don’t move out (or if my mom kicks him out/he willingly leaves) I’m going to have a mental breakdown because I already spent over half of my life living with my deadbeat alcohol father who is fortunately gone now, and anymore stress is horrible for me.",21May2019,3
5,"(This is long and I’m sorry) I haven’t really told anyone about this and I need to get it out... 

I (23F) work at a law office where we are kinda 2 places in one. One attorney that I do not work for, had a client(21M) that I thought was SUPER attractive. Attorneys assistant knew this, it became an office joke and she always told me when my “boyfriend” was coming to the office. 

Fast forward and 6 months go by, he comes in one day and he was very obvious about checking me out. We flirted per usual, and that was that. I talked to Attorneys Assistant and I said “F*** it. I’m gonna message him.” And I did, I looked him up on Facebook. I said “I’m sorry if this is weird, ignore it if you’re not interested but here’s my number.” He literally immediately texted me and was like “I was dying to ask you for your number. But I didn’t know if you’d be into it or not.” 

We’ve been chatting for a few weeks now, daily. We’ve both been verbal about our attraction to each other. And we have a date set for a few weeks from now. But here’s the issue...I’m a full time mom (hence why the date is a few weeks from now). And I’m incredibly worried about what my family will think. 

Long story short on him:: Charged with drug possession, he’s been clean for over 6 months (it was more so selling than using) I asked Attorneys Assistant to be straight up with me, does she think he’s trouble and a lost cause or should I give this a shot. She said “I’ve met him and his family. I’ve been doing this a long time and to me it seems like he went down the wrong path with shitty friends. He genuinely wants to be better and he’s really trying.” And I see that too, he’s been honest with me about what’s going on &amp; I want to believe him. 

Again my problem is when it comes to my family. They will be quick to judge a criminal past, even though he has an amazing job &amp; family. It’s to the point where I wonder if I have to hide him for a little bit or cut him out completely. He’s been so sweet to me &amp; he’s planning a really nice first date and I haven’t been this genuinely excited for a date in a LONG time. I’m just at a loss on what to do.",21May2019,2

I’m 19 yo girl and my only issue is one of my very front teeth jutts out pretty far, I like to call it my can opener 😂😂. 

I had braces when I was young but failed on wearing the retainer so it came back, I don’t really want the big clunky metal braces again so I really like the idea of the invisible braces.

9,"Love is a stupid thing. 

If a woman doesn't want to  fuck you badly, you are just her bitch. 

Guys who fuck women without giving her commitment are the real winners in life.

The guy who has to commit his life to a woman to get laid is a loser. 

Love is lame. All that matters is being sexually desirable.

I have no reason to live life as a mediocre looking, short man. 

Women don't want to fuck me. Sure, some girl might settle with me after shes slept with all the studs.

But that's a sad fate. 

The real winners are the guys who fuck girls because women are thirsty for them. They get to experience true unconditional desire and passion.

All three of my kind of friends (they’re all closer with each other than me and I don’t hang with them outside of school) are moving home hours away. I’m staying in the city until mid July bc that’s when my lease is up. I’m so fucking lonely already and can only imagine how bad it’s gonna be without classes. I’ve never really had any close meaningful friendships that have lasted. I have moved every few years of my life and have no sense of permanence, so this is just par for the course. That’s literally all I want but i only have two months here, which isn’t time for anything, especially considering this is kinda a college town so no one is here in summer. The closest person I have to a friend here is a kind of almost older girlfriend who only wants me like a third the time, which honestly makes me feel like shit, but I’ll take the company and affection when she wants it. I have never felt so sad and alone. Tonight I went to the arboretum and cried in my car for two and a half hours thinking about how alone I am in this world.

I (18F) have an irrational phobia of toilets. I always have. It’s not a germ thing, it’s not other people, it’s the actual toilet itself. The only toilets I’ll use are ones in houses, sometimes if I really have to go, I can eventually go after standing and staring at the toilet for 10 minutes. Even when I do go, I lean forward as far as I can while covering my ears and go as fast as I can push. I have bad memories of going to disney world, my mom trying to push me in the stall while I was screaming like I was in pain, people staring. I went on a cruise once and peed in the shower the entire time. The toilets at my school are terrifying. They’re loud, they flush with a sensor. The worst kind ever. I peed today. Still terrified of toilets, but I fucking peed.

Echo company from the get go I disliked. At first I didn’t know why but I just did. As time went by holy shit I started full on hating them. I have never met so many undisciplined individuals, not even in the civilian world much less in military. I thought it would eventually go away since it was barely a month into boot cmao(phase 1) but it never did. I was honestly ashamed of graduating with them. I came to MCT with them and they just got even worse.

27,"I want to share with everyone the 3 things I learnt as a Buddhist Monk and how it has shaped the way I perceive the world, changing the way I live my life.

Briefly, it's how understanding cause and effect develops our wisdom, how experiencing impermanence brings us peace, and how practicing mindfulness leads to fulfillment.

Being a Buddhist Monk taught me to understand the benefits of loving-kindness and compassion by deeply experiencing the effects it has on myself, the world and the people around. In turn, Buddhism teaches us how we can create immense joy and happiness and become the source of love and harmony that everyone needs and deserves.

The very act of expenditure to reach the zoo, the fuel, calories, infrastructure to run and maintain the system outside the zoo, not to mention inside the zoo itself: food court, exhibit space, landscaping, selfie areas. The road to the animal sanctuary cuts through the beaver's native range. The classroom lights and the tablets to teach the next generation's zoologists; Knowledge itself is unsustainable. How can we comprehend the hundreds and thousands of miles necessary to maintain just a single species? These splendid cages blind us to the inevitable destruction of our caring.

44,"Ok so I am married with a child and a second coming In a few weeks. I started posting pics on Reddit few weeks ago and liked the attention and honestly I just love dicks. Been having a sexual awakening recently and me and my hubby have been trying lots of new things. I love giving him BJs like ALOT! But I keep obessessing over dicks! I like them, I want more of them but I love my husband's too alot, but I just want more.....                                         I had a few BJ sessions with a co-worker a year ago with my husband's permission cause we were experimenting with things..... I didn't have sex with him but I wanted to bad.... So that's how I knew I liked doing it so much. And since then I've had trouble not thinking about it. I love going down on my husband and making him cum, and love fucking him..... But I just keep thinking about that guy.            Not all the time but often enough..... I wish I had fucked him for the full experience, but that was against me and my hubby's agreement..... But I loved feeling the guys dick in my mouth and tried to take it all, (couldn't cause he was about 2 or 3 inches longer) but I just loved the way it felt and how it made him feel.                                                                          I just loved the attention, the ability to make some guy feel so good! I mean he was calling my name and made me feel sexy tired once. He came in my mouth all 3 times and he usually only lasted like 2 or 3 minutes.... I also enjoyed the challenge of trying to fit his bigger cock in my mouth which us just a different experience. I still wish I could fuck him just to see what sex with a BBC is like but my hubby is not ok with that at all.

I also just want try sex with a woman.                                         The problem is that my hubby asked me to stop and I did. But now I am obessessing about dicks, fucking them, sucking them, holding them.... And the size and such isn't that important, I just want dicks..... I don't know exactly why but I do. And it bothers my husband that I like it so much and want more. He keeps feeling like I don't particularly want him anymore, which I certainly do, but I just want this in addition.

54,"I've recently been having a tough time existing and finally found out one of the main pillars of my depression. The discovery was serendipitous. On a whim, I decided to start reading ""Feeling Good"" by David Burns, a book I bought a while ago regarding depression through the lens of cognitive therapy. I read with some scepticism, skimming through the case studies and just wanting actual strategies and solutions. I then reached the part where he listed ten cognitive distortions and one distortion was particularly relevant:

""Emotional reasoning plays a role in nearly all your depressions. Because things FEEL so negative to you, you assume they truly are. It doesn't occur to you to challenge the validity of the perceptions that create your feelings.""

I laughed. Fuck. I was overly assuming that the way I felt about things in my depression was a reflection of reality whereas in fact it was cognitive distortion. As someone with an interest in Buddhism, I should've known or come across this, but sometimes it's the way an idea is conveyed that finally hits the nail on the head. Calling it a distortion and the Alan Watts quote that Zen is ""spiritual opthalmology"" allowed me to see how twisted my thinking was.

As I read on, Burns asks the reader to do an exercise to identify the negative thoughts regarding one's self esteem, the cognitive distortions present in any particular thought, and a rebuttal of why that thought is distorted. My negative thoughts were mostly about my flaws as being incontrovertible proofs of my unattractiveness. Once I identified the distortions, I realised during the process of writing the rebuttals there was a huge amount of assumptions and mind reading on my part as to what the other possible people would think and feel. And because dating is susceptible to self-fulfilling prophecy, I realised I was rejecting myself for other people. In other words, I was making their decisions for them as to my attractiveness and worth. This is lunacy. There is no possible way I could decide anything for anyone. Sure, my flaws will have an influence, but the degree of this influence is unknown to me. What if the other person liked me for who I was. Despite my flaws. Despite my perception of my flaws. Despite the ""incontrovertible facts"". I cried.

It was then I realised how low my self-esteem had gotten. Thoughts festered upon thoughts festered upon thoughts...it's unsurprising that if you feel unworthy, unloved, valueless, unattractive it makes sense that depression will follow. And slowly over the years it festered into this huge, ugly thing.

Writing this a couple of weeks on from that exercise, I'm feeling a lot better. I don't think I've finished bailing the water from the boat yet, but the self-esteem part of the depression has been somewhat alleviated. This has allowed me to address the other things contributing to the depression, such as lack of socialising and connection and variety and fun, and slowly slowly I'm feeling a reenchantment of existence.

Thank you for reading, and have a day with fewer cognitive distortions.",21May2019,52

64,"and at some point I guess it must have come out. I told my friend, basically, that I didn't really want to continue living anymore. That life wasn't worth it. And she tells me that if I kill myself, she will too.

This is probably some form of manipulation, but I don't really care, honestly. I think, despite me being an absolute shit, it's probably because she would miss me. I'll probably never be happy with my life, but now there's an actual reason not to kill myself. I want to. But she deserves a happy life, and if I go, I'm not sure if she'd actually kill herself or not.",21May2019,2
65,"So I don’t know if I should be proud or not but last night I stayed up till 12 am working on a presentation for school
My mom let me sleep in 40 minutes and drove me to school, I was super tired but excited to present because I was very proud of my presentation I had created.

A few blocks from the school I heard tires squealing then the car jolted forward and made a loud noise, the next few minutes I was in shock and didn’t know what happened. I heard my mom screaming and crying and swearing and I realized we were in a car accident. 

A few extra details, I now know that I have a concussion, and I made it worse by getting out of the car as soon as I was hit and trying to help the other people involved. I was eating yogurt and when I was hit it flew all over me and into my hair. My hair is naturally curly (I had it straightened) and it was raining so it was frizzy and covered in yogurt. 

After the police and medics got there I was told I should go home and rest or go to the doctor, I told my dad that I needed to do my presentation and he agreed to drive me to the school. I stormed into the classroom, covered in rain, leaves, and yogurt, and the teacher excused my absence. He told me he wanted me to go to the nurse ( and the nurses were calling the classroom to check me out). I told him I wasn’t leaving till I gave that presentation and after arguing and begging he said “you’re crazy” and gave my presentation (everyone likes it) and now I’m recovering 😎",21May2019,1

71,"I am a guy who is turning 30 this summer, and me and my family have been blessed with good health and no terminal illness. However I have always struggled with various forms of anxiety. Long story short, I dreamt of Canada so I managed to move here, get an education and now I’m moving up in the mountains for a job. The town is right up my alley and I’ve actually eyeballed it for years before finally landing the job.

Now I can’t let go of the thought that I’ll go there and immediately discover something wrong with my health, or someone back home is going to die or something else. Only because another good thing is happening to me. I know there’s an actual term for this but I can’t remember it now.

73,"So I feel like this is the opposite of the question that is usually asked, but I'm starting to feel like the fact that I have no desire to post on social media (especially selfies and stuff) to be... abnormal, and I'm not sure what it says about myself.

So, from other peoples' accounts I'm a pretty good looking guy. I'm not cocky, I never even really thought anything of my looks until I started working out a lot and I guess improved my looks fairly drastically in my early 20s. So I don't think I'm ugly or anything, I just... don't really see why anyone would want to see my face pop up in their feed? Besides maybe a significant other if I had one, and at that point if I were in their shoes I'd rather them send a pic like that directly to me instead of to social media fishing for likes...

One thing that I find is that a lot of times I talk to a girl on a dating app and she asks for my Instagram... and I'm like ""yeah have at it, but I've only posted a few pics and zero are of me."" It probably leads these girls to assume I'm either catfishing or just weird in general. This has made me consider posting some pictures of myself but I just REALLY don't want to, and I'm not even sure why that is, and I kind of want to understand why.

Does anyone else here feel that way? Maybe at some deep level I don't want people to think that I'm a narcissist or something? To make it clear, I also don't post my opinions or the things I am doing to social media either. Now I'm starting to wonder if deep down I have self esteem issues?

Ive loved horses since I was little. Never went away. Used to ride. Trained them. I love nature. 

Somehow got sucked up into the city. Good. Because i needed it. But i feel like ive sucked my time here dry and I want to to back.  Im 19 studying  environmental science. I have depression, anxiety. I love the learning, but I hate my town. Im also queer, and im always getting threats. 

I feel too young to be hit with this, like im too new to make these descisions, but this feeling feels ancient. I feel it in my chest and it hurts. It hurts and it burns and I want to be nowhere else. 
Its not even the first time ive felt it. I feel it every time i go out and work with horses. 
It's almost holy.. nature. i live in texas, and seeing the hills...i am humbled beyond words.


I dont think ill be able to keep the land my parents gave me (they dont support me being gay, and are emotionally abusive). Its a litttle too small, anyways...But... maybe one day... id like to have a place with horses. Where kids like me can feel safe. Where people who are burdened can find solace in nature.

78,"I tried to summarize what I experienced as best I could. Can you tell me how much is this narcissism? Is this a normal family? Am I crazy or unreasonable? Is this abuse? Any psychologists or therapists who can comment on these behaviors?

 1. My mother would probe, and intrude, asking questions about my life events or feelings.

 2. Beginning around age 7, if I protested or declined an answer, she would pout or be sad to induce emotional guilt or shame. And/or then be emotionally distant or uncaring for days.

 3. So I would share, trusting.

 4. She would take that info, or other info on events in my life and later share it with her friends, my teachers, sometimes my friends, sometimes just random strangers. In whatever context. It did not matter, there was never a way to tell. The betrayal of trust could happen at any time.

 5. I would be justifiably upset at a boundary being broken and being violated.

 6. I would complain, or cry, or threaten, or get angry or lash out.

 7. At my response she would pout to induce guilt, or get angry to induce fear and guilt, or apologize and be sad inducing guilt or shame, or affect an extremely emotional fear or victim response outside of the level of my actions inducing shock from me, and anger towards me from any witnesses. Then she would discuss the incident with my father.

 8. Perhaps 95% of the time my father would never take her to task, or reprimand her when it came to my behavior, or any interaction between my mother and I. I was always the perpetrator in all occurrences. He would first ask, then often threaten me with restrictions, or corporeal punishment, to force me to apologize and take back any protest. If I refused, or argued, he would become verbally angry, physically threatening, and corporeal punishment was always an option.

 9. All of my reactions that were angry or fighting back in these incidents were later used as leverage to induce guilt and shame against me to attempt to force me to relent or comply to whatever it was she wanted me to do or say at the moment. Or to prevent me from having a wish granted that was in her control until I was made to feel shame and guilt to her satisfaction. ""Now, the last time you did this such and such happened and you were totally out of control. I don't think we'll let you do this again."" ""You have been very hard to deal with and just awful, I don't think it's a good idea if you go to such and such a place."" ""You really hurt my feelings the other day when you said such and such, we think you need to do such and such instead.""

10. As a result, my own feelings of violation, intrusion, oppression, betrayal, abandonment, were  denied and subjected to her domination and control. However chaotic or cavalier. The subjects of violations included everything from bathroom habits, to romantic crushes, to seemingly benign things as how I felt about books or TV shows, to my personal dreams of a career or a future, to events I was ashamed of, to things I was proud of, to secrets or private matters or anything of all shape and sort.

 11. If I protested this dynamic, trying to explain my feelings and how victimized I felt, examples were demanded from me of any violations. If I gave an example, the broad majority of these instances were framed as normal and part of every family, and I was told I was ""being unreasonable"" to protest these violations. As a justification, examples were given of celebrities who told stories of their mother doing something embarrassing. And ultimately, that I was a problem because I wanted to have a boundary and privacy. And denying a young person any privacy, and preventing them from having the RIGHT to share or not share THEIR OWN personhood by extracting it and then sharing it anyway, was all supposed to be completely normal according to her, and my father.

81,"I cried a lot when I was a kid, but since puberty I've never really been able to. I sometimes get misty eyed over movies, but it's never triggered by anything in real life. 

I suppose that's not entirely true. I remember crying myself to sleep regularly during my toughest periods of teenage angst. Another very specific moment comes to mind. I used to take walks through the forest alone regularly. I needed some space so that I could speak out without anyone listening. I talked with myself a lot, about a lot of things. I didn't really have anyone else to talk to. During one of these walks I managed to trigger myself and I suddenly just started bawling my eyes out. I believe the phrase that triggered me was something akin to ""... I'm worthless."". In the moment, I was very surprised and I just couldn't stop. It must have been years worth of emotions that I'd been building up. Years of being told that you're ugly, slow, and unwanted. Years of being ignored. Years of not having anyone to talk to. 

I don't know why I try so hard. It's clearly not for anyone else's benefit, as no one else cares. Maybe to just once in this rotten, torture of a life get some validation from someone. Not that I'd acknowledge if I ever got it.

87,"I (24F) have a friend (32F) who has a boyfriend that my fiance and I despise. When we first met him, he was a pretty cool dude, but obviously that is not the case anymore. Before my friend and him got together, he had gotten drunk one night (he's an alcoholic) and called her a whore and stuff, because she originally didn't want to give him a chance. Well, that was strike one for me. Anyways, they end up getting together. 
About a month after their relationship started, he told her he was going to go hang out with a guy friend about an hour away and that he would probably end up staying the night. When he got ready to leave, she had a horrible feeling wash over her that he wasn't going to his friend's house. A few hours later, he told her he was coming home, because his friend's wife came home and he didn't feel comfortable being there. When he got home, he was drunk off his ass and went straight to bed. My friend ended up going through his phone. She found out that he was hanging out with another female whose name is his phone was a man's name. She called the number and talked to the girl, which said that he had been trying to get with her and that he was being really weird so she had him take her home. I wanted to beat his ass then. She went off on him and they ended up ""working things out"". I told her that I would prefer not to be around him to avoid drama. 
We didn't speak for about a week. During that time, we found out that he had also been texting his ex telling her that he loved and missed her, sent her old pictures of them, etc. She decided to break it off with him, but still live with him. I knew this was a bad idea, but of course she didn't listen. I explained to her that even though she loved him, it was not worth it. It was not worth her worrying about whether he's lying or not everyday and such. He haf, at that point, called one of her children a weirdo and an asshole (to her, not the child) and claimed that was one of the reasons he felt like their relationship wouldn't work. He claimed that my friend wasn't good enough to his child. He said that he was so confused because he wanted her but he wanted his family (his ex, her kids, and his daughter and who isn't this ex's), too. He also got into a quick relationship with the ex while him and my friend were split up. That ended as soon as she told the ex that he was still living with her. Again, I told her it's not worth it. 
Anyways, she told me about 2 and a half weeks ago that they were back together. I just told her it isn't going to end well, and she knew it. A few days later, my fiance and I stopped by her house to hang out for a few since her boyfriend was at work. She said something about her boyfriend, and my fiance said something. I told him it was mean. He said he didn't care. I can't remember the actual conversation, or I would put it. Either way, he didn't say anything that would or should be considered him talking to her like trash. The day after, he got a message from from her boyfriend telling him not to come around anymore because he talked to her like trash or he can come talk to him. This pissed me off, I'm not going to lie. Before I found this out, I had asked my friend to ride with me for 45 minutes, due to a personal issue with my ex. She said she would. Between the time of me asking her to do this and actually picking her up, I had found out about the messages. When I picked her up, she was drunk. She has been drinking more heavily and more often since they have been together. We get to where we needed to go, and I decided I needed to talk to her. I explained how I felt about the messages. She took up for her boyfriend and said that he just took it bad. I told her that my fiance in no way talked to her like trash. She said that he hurt her feelings. I said I understood that, and ask if he did he actually talk to her like trash. She said no. I also told her how I felt about the relationship, again. She said she knew he had done her wrong, but she wanted to stay with him because ""he gets her in a way that nobody else has"", including me. About 15 minutes go by, and she started whining that she wanted to go home. I asked her why, and she said because she didn't know what he was doing and was worried he might be texting his ex. I ended up taking her home. On the way, she kept asking me to come inside and give her boyfriend a chance to make up. I told her no multiple times. I even told her that it wouldn't be a good idea, because I would probably go off on him.

It's been over a week since this happened and we haven't spoken. I would like to work things out for our kids' sake. My child misses her kids and wants to see them. We miss the kids and even her. Yet, I don't know if I really should even get back into that friendship. I feel like it would just be a bunch of drama. Also, I don't know if I should message her or wait and see if she messages me. I guess my question is what would y'all do in this situation?

89,"Last month I experienced this new feeling and right now I am going through it again, thought I’d write it out.  Alright so, have you ever felt like there some impending doom but like then that feeling is exaggerated even more by the fact that what’s causing that feeling you know it cannot be stopped, for example, imagine been on a train going 200mph and you look out the window and you see the railroad tracks ahead are broken and lead into a massive ravine. You know what’s about to happen(heading straight for derailment into a huge drop) and you know the end result (death) but you can’t do anything to stop it. You’re going 200 mph and nothing you do now will stop the train you just have to wait there until it ends. 

Today I graduated MCT(marine combat training) and a few hours after that I was on a bus headed for LAX which is headed for Virginia. I grew up having really severe anxiety, to the point it limited me in literary doing everything. I used to stay home 24/7. I was wake up, school, home. Rinse and repeat and even then I dreaded the thought of going to school due to my anxiety. Eventually somehow it went away overnight, almost completely at least. 

I was always really ambitious but I never acted in it, how could I? So when it went away I went 100% knowing just as it had disappeared overnight it could just as well appear overnight. I enlisted in the marine corps and here I am now 🤷‍♂️ for the first time in my life I went 400 miles away to San Diego for boot camp. I came home and went to MCT around 300miles away. Now it’s directly to the opposite side of the country. 

I am extremely excited to be going to Virginia but there’s that tiny part of me that still has anxiety. 

Oh and forgot to mention this, the “being stuck there knowing you cannot do anything to stop the train” meant me being in the military my actions aren’t up to me. I’m told where and when to be at a certain location soo can’t stop the progression",21May2019,3

But she also chose me for 2 interviews and didn’t say that anything about appearance at all the 2nd time",21May2019,1
93,"This is probably very badly written because it’s literally a train of thought and I know if I look at it too much I will probably overthink it and just never post anything about it, but this has been bothering me a while.

Hi everyone, I am coming up from a slight mental breakdown from giving my final high school presentation and I realized that the reason I was so nervous is because I have such a hard time being open about myself. I can easily give a presentation on a subject in front of a class but I got really nervous doing this presentation in front of two teachers, especially when I got into how I was really sad and lonely during my previous years. When I think about it I rarely share my emotions and vulnerabilities with people, I feel like I keep a cool and indifferent exterior even though I am so emotional by myself. Growing up I would never talk to even my mom and sister about usual stuff like what boys I like even though I have been a hopeless romantic since the first day of school, and I even didn’t tell my mom when I got my first period just because I was uncomfortable with it. And the problem isn’t even them, I am super privileged and had a pretty great childhood; the only thing that I can think of that made me so hesitant to open up is they used to tease me about “liking” certain boys (literally calliou(idk how to spell it that bald little cartoon)) even when I begged them to stop. I think it might just be a fear of intimacy in general, I even feel uncomfortable saying “I love you” to my mom. The only time I can really recall opening up about pretty much everything: the boy I was secretly crushing on for 2 years, the depressive episodes I get, the loneliness I felt; is when I was slightly drunk and having a deep conversation with two of my friends. I think this is the reason why I have a harder time with one on one relationships, even with my friends, I now have plenty but I usually hang out in groups, going between these three different groups led to me feeling kinda alienated by all of them. And I think this is probably the reason I have never been in a romantic relationship, I get so hesitant when things begin to get intimate and I crave love so bad but just can’t seem to find it. 

But anyways, I think that I realized all of this stuff just lately, and I want to change but I don’t know what to do. Is anyone else in a similar spot or have any advice?",21May2019,12
94,"Hi, I’ll just get straight to the point. I’m an 18 year old depressed introverted socially anxious lonely high school dropout who had no friends and lives in a small town. Lately, i’ve also been having suicidal thoughts. It feels like nothing I do is important and it feels like i’m not worthy of anything. Sounds like a lie when I say it like that, but i’ve been dealing with all of this for years, and my family seems to show no desire in really helping me. I need someone experienced in life in general to talk to. I just feel so hopeless and don’t even have any direction in life. I’ve never had any guidance, not even when I was younger. It feels like i’m completely alone in life. There’s a lot more to it but i’d be writing way way way too much for anyone to want to quickly read. If someone could help or even just show support, that would be great.",21May2019,108

101,"I discovered this about myself the last few days, I don’t know if it has a definition or not ( please tell me if you do know) its like a coping mechanism that my brain has started to protect me from life problems, I have tendency to forget ( not in forget my name but more like ignore ) something or a situation if it did hurt me so for exp I found out that my dad died my head is like it’s not really serious better focus on this urge of yours to dance or to study or whatever, and I don’t think it’s okay , it’s like my head “normalize” everything and make it sound totally cool. I don’t know if it’s just me or it’s a common thing really !",21May2019,4
102,"""Never go to sleep angry with them."" That advice really shaped the core of how I approached relationships. Among other things. Of all places, I discovered that advice being given to a groom at the conclusion of a fantasy book series (LotR-esque) that I read when I was very young called The Belgariad. 


I can't recall ever having mentally done a double-take so hard. The chances of me randomly deciding to revisit a book that I had completely forgotten the contents of, but knew was a favorite once upon a time, and realizing that there is a very good chance that this is where I picked up something that shaped me so significantly really struck an ""amused/coincidental"" cord with me, and I just wanted to share with anyone.",21May2019,2

104,"I didnt know what title to use so i just go with this one.

So basically i like doing work that requires physical work. My Dad used to take to construction sites since he builds railings out of steel and needs help lifting it so he can install them. Everytime he takes me with him for help, i get extremely worn out and just exhausted and i fucking love it. Now, here is the problem since 4-5 months my help wasnt required im currently in college so the only work i do is studying, but that doesnt exhaust me, i need physical exhaustion.

I tried applying to multiple jobs but i got rejected from like 40-50 places so i have given up, it isnt about the money i just want something to do. Working out doesnt quite have the same effect since its not really a job or responsibility.

So my question would be, do you have any suggestions what i could do or what i should pick up. Because not doing anything makes my body feel so weird and i would appreciate some ideas im generally open to everything.",21May2019,0
105,"What I eat is technically dead. So yes, the cherries I ate were dead but are now me and emailing you. Death and life go together. I think you think that the conscious THom thing that talks and stuff defines you and that that defines your life. I don't think there is any separate form of life, that there is no such thing. I experience the entire thing as one thing constantly changing, hopefully evolving, and so far it is what we call alive. It is beautiful, pure, and perfect. That is what Messiahsez. Yo.

His life got cut short. We never really got along in elementary school and I always thought he was a bit of troublemaker and that he could’ve always been better. Even though we never saw eye to eye and even though we weren’t close at all, it sucks to hear that someone you knew, someone from your neighborhood, someone from your community, die in such a senseless, violent way. He was too young to die. He didn’t even get to really live life yet, and he never will.
